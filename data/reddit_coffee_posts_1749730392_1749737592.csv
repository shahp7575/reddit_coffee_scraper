1l9ngil,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1l9ngil/lor_barista_update_nothing_tastes_like_nespresso/,L'OR Barista Update - Nothing Tastes Like Nespresso,"## TL;DR ##
A Nespresso OL Machine will beat the L'OR Barista 8 days a week, but the L'OR Barista is a decent intro to OL pods and better than a Keurig.

My L'OR Barista arrived (after nearly a month of waiting). I descaled my Inissia and tested pods head to head from each of them, and the L'OR Barista doesn't hold a candle to the blazing inferno that is a true Nespresso machine.

## Testing Methodology ##
My testing method with any comparison between two coffees is always the same. I grab two identical mugs (in this case, espresso mugs), put a mark on the bottom indicating which coffee it is, and brew into the mugs.

Normally I'm testing between two different kinds of pods, so one is slightly less freshly brewed than the other, but in this case, testing between two machines, they are brewed at the same time.

## Testing Results ##
I tried Shanghai, Tokyo, Volluto (again), Illy Decaf (again), Nicaragua, and Colombia.

(Yes, I have the caffeine shakes now, but I do this in the name of science and coffee!)

No matter which pod, in a blind taste test, I can correctly identify the cup that came from the L'OR every. single. time.

And every single time, it's because the Inissia is putting way more flavor into the cup than the L'OR. The L'OR Barista just isn't extracting nearly as much flavor as the Inissia.

## Coffee Pods ##
I thought maybe the coffee pods could save it, but I've now tried Provacateur, Chateau, and Le Tigre. With each pod, I could identify a VL pod that is better tasting and that I would prefer even with the VL pods costing more.

## Conclusion ##
If you snagged a L'OR Barista in the recent sale and have never tried OL, you're going to love your L'OR Barista. But, apples to apples, it just isn't going to beat a true Nespresso machine.

I think the L'OR Barista is better than a Keurig, but we all know that isn't saying much.

So, my mother in law will be receiving a brand new (except for about a dozen pods brewed) L'OR Barista for free, and I will continue to be a Nespresso stan.

It's like being handed a steaming bowl of legacy spaghetti code, garnished with compliance headaches and served with a side of ""but it worked on the old system."" But whether you're a seasoned engineer or a healthcare startup founder flirting with modernization, you can‚Äôt ignore this: Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems **need to evolve**, and migration is no longer a ‚Äúsomeday‚Äù conversation. It's a **now** problem.

And yes, it‚Äôs messy. But it‚Äôs also one of the biggest opportunities in digital health today.

# Why EMR Migration Is a Ticking Time Bomb for Legacy Systems

Healthcare orgs sitting on 15-year-old systems built on outdated frameworks are staring down the barrel of regulatory changes, interoperability standards, and growing expectations for real-time access. Add in the push for **FHIR compliance**, **HIPAA updates**, and **AI-driven patient analytics**, and suddenly your crusty old EMR starts looking like a liability rather than an asset.

Here‚Äôs the brutal truth: **If your EMR system can't integrate, scale, or secure - you‚Äôre already behind**.

Most legacy EMRs were never designed to sync with mobile apps, AI dashboards, or even simple web-based interfaces. This creates bottlenecks and breaks workflows that should be automated. And while there are tools to bridge the gaps, duct-taping APIs over monoliths doesn‚Äôt qualify as futureproofing.

# Top Challenges Devs Face (and How to Outsmart Them)

Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it: **EMR migration sucks** \- if you don‚Äôt know what you're doing. From a development standpoint, here are the nightmares you‚Äôll run into:

* **Data mapping hell:** You‚Äôll have to align inconsistent field structures, outdated ICD-9 codes, and bizarre custom attributes that nobody documented.
* **Interoperability roulette:** HL7, FHIR, X12‚Ä¶ pick your poison. Without proper middleware and structured APIs, even basic inter-system handshakes break down.
* **Regulatory landmines:** HIPAA compliance isn't just about encrypting data; it‚Äôs about access logs, role-based permissions, and audit trails - everywhere.

Pro tip: Start with **process mining**. It's not just a buzzword. Before migrating a single record, map out actual workflows - not the ideal ones in the SOP manual. You‚Äôll quickly spot redundant processes that can be eliminated or replaced with **custom RPA solutions** post-migration.

# Don‚Äôt Lift and Shift - Rewire and Reinvent

Too many companies fall into the trap of doing a ""lift and shift"" - just dumping old data into a new system. But this ignores the real value of EMR migration: **the chance to redesign your architecture for scalability, compliance, and automation**.

What should you do instead?

1. **Refactor workflows, not just databases.** Clean up your logic and integrate automation wherever human error is a factor (think: patient intake, billing reconciliation, insurance eligibility checks).
2. **Architect for integrations.** Build with RESTful APIs from the start. Your EMR shouldn‚Äôt be a walled garden - it needs to play nice with lab systems, imaging platforms, CRMs, and even wearable tech.
3. **Design for data liquidity.** Patients expect seamless transitions between providers, platforms, and devices. If your data isn‚Äôt portable, your business won‚Äôt be either.

# Why Outsourcing Isn‚Äôt a Risk - It‚Äôs a Lifeline

Here‚Äôs the dirty little secret: most in-house teams don‚Äôt have the bandwidth or expertise to do EMR migration right. You need domain expertise in healthcare standards, compliance law, and full-stack development - and often **hyperautomation skillsets** too.

That's where companies like **Abto Software** stand out. Unlike generalist dev shops, Abto specializes in **healthtech modernization**, offering **custom RPA development, process mining, and deep system integration**. Their approach doesn‚Äôt just move data; it **transforms** how systems interact - giving clients not just a new EMR, but a competitive edge.

Team augmentation is also a huge value-add. If your internal devs know your business logic but lack integration chops, pulling in experienced healthcare devs on-demand means you‚Äôre not wasting months on tribal knowledge transfer.

# Pro Tips from the Trenches

Let‚Äôs be real: no one gets EMR migration 100% right on the first try. But here are a few regular expressions to live by (metaphorically speaking):

* `.*legacy.* ‚Üí ""scrutinize deeply""`
* `.*integration.* ‚Üí ""plan early and automate testing""`
* `.*custom_code.* ‚Üí ""document or die trying""`
* `.*compliance.* ‚Üí ""assume you‚Äôre not compliant until proven otherwise""`

Also - **don‚Äôt wait until migration day to do load testing**. Your new EMR may look beautiful, but if the backend wheezes under a normal clinic load, your users will revolt faster than a dropped coffee machine in a nurse's station.

# EMR Migration Is More Than a Technical Task

It‚Äôs a business transformation. And while developers love to talk code, the winners in this space are those who understand the **intersection of tech, compliance, and care delivery**. Whether you're consulting for a private clinic or rebuilding the tech stack of a national hospital network, the goal is the same: better systems, better outcomes.

So before your legacy system takes your reputation down with it, ask yourself: **Is it time to migrate - or time to innovate?** Because in 2025, they‚Äôre the same thing.",1,1749737397.0,OutsourceDevHub,0,1.0,False

Normally, I‚Äôm a very private person. I hate it when people enter my room without notice ‚Äî I‚Äôve always made a fuss about it. I don‚Äôt like people coming into the space where I pray, sleep, and have sex without warning me first. Also, I‚Äôm very messy, and I don‚Äôt like anyone seeing that. If you give me a heads-up, I‚Äôll tidy up and we can even have a coffee inside. If you violate my privacy, you can expect me to act nuclear.

I believe this is exactly why the right to privacy exists and I am not a terrorist for that.

A few weeks ago, I moved to a foreign country for a research stay, and I‚Äôm living in a student dorm. I handle confidential information (covered by confidentiality agreements), but I can‚Äôt leave it in a bank ‚Äî it has to be kept securely in my room, as I have no other safe place to store it. The dorm‚Äôs own regulations clearly state that staff can only enter with prior notice, and that there is no cleaning service in the rooms.

Well, they entered my room without informing me. Apparently, they wanted to check one of the beds (I share the room with my girlfriend), since she was arriving in three days. As someone who values their privacy ‚Äî and in order to protect confidential data ‚Äî I politely asked why they had entered, and requested that they not do it again (I believe this is a perfectly legitimate and reasonable reaction).

Their response was: *‚ÄúWe came to check the guest‚Äôs bed, we fixed yours too, and your trash smelled like trash.‚Äù* (Apparently here they expect it to smell like Chanel N¬∫5. If you tell me in advance, I‚Äôll take it out ‚Äî but if you enter unannounced and see something you don‚Äôt like, that‚Äôs on you.) Basically, their message was: *‚ÄúThis is how we do things here ‚Äî if you don‚Äôt like it, leave.‚Äù*

Since my privacy had been violated and they weren‚Äôt addressing my concerns, I sent a more serious and firm email. They didn‚Äôt like that at all: they threatened to expel me and to send a health inspection. A largue list of retrailments followed by insults and unfounded acusations.

These staff members have been in their positions for 20 years and apparently don‚Äôt even know their own rules. They cannot enter without notice based on their own internal rules. Fine ‚Äî it happened. But at least apologize and promise it won‚Äôt happen again. I handle confidential data, and clearly I get very pissed off when my privacy is violated like this.

At this point, realizing I wasn‚Äôt going to get anywhere with them, I went to the university‚Äôs rectorate to try to get someone to mediate. No one wanted to: they threatened to cancel my invitation instead. The whole situation caused me a lot of stress, and no one offered to mediate. Everyone washed their hands of it and kept threatening me. It felt like a Kafkaesque nightmare (nobody applies rules, they threaten you, no basic privacy rights, nobody want to get involved) ‚Äî only much more ridiculous.

I must tell that I prefer being in my country, where nobody inspects my underpants without my prior notice and I have no need to do an international collaboration if my privacy is not respected.

1l9n9ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l9n9ei/starbucks_barista_frustrations/,[Starbucks Barista Frustrations],"So I recently picked up a Barista for a decent price.  I've been doing some minor repairs like a new grouphead gasket, shower screen, mushroom valve and spring and threaded insert.  I then bought a edesia bottomless portafilter as I prefer that over pressurized.

For a grinder I have a capresso infinity.  I did the ""hack"" where you loosen the screw  a bit on the bottom burr to raise it.  I can definitely grind fine enough to choke the machine.

After getting the bottomless portafilter and tinkering with the grinder I proceeded to dial everything in.  It took me about 6-7 shots before I got a good pull.  I was trying from 14-16g of coffee and marked that range on my grinder.

I then decided to replace the OPV spring and put in a 9 bar one.  After that the machine would make kind of a squealing sound and could never get a good shot.  I am guessing from research the sound was either the OPV valve opening and closing or possibly the boiler.  I eventually gave up and put the stock one back in.  The sound went away.  

My technique is grind, WDT, level, then tamp.  The tamper is preset at 20#. 

I am starting to wonder if the grinder is the issue.  Because if I grind 14g at where I dialed the grinder in initiall for 14g it is slow and chokes the machine, then if I go to the 16g mark on the grinder I get too fast of a shot, in between the 14 and 16 it seems to be somewhere in the middle.  The grinder is not stepless and from 14-16 is 3 notches.

I am getting frustrated.  The only other thing I have left to try is going to 15-16g of coffee even though it's a 14g basket and playing with tamping. 

I also have a puck screen I have tried but not seeing any real results using that.

Any suggestions?  I am not above buying a grinder if I have to but since I've heard lf success with modifying the capresso and I had one I thought I'd try.  I have only pulled a few really good shots with this machine and don't want that kind of variability.

Ok, here goes my top 5 nominations as selected by my ADHD brain:

1. **Onyx Tonics**: 9.8/10. These baristas are actually wizards. Interesting bagged roast selection that rotates, although can be a bit pricey. I devote a notable amount of time day dreaming about their espresso menu (i may have a problem). 
2. **Vivid:** 9/10. Their roasted beans are some of the best around. I like their affiliation w/ Vermont Green. Does get a lil' crowded during the school year with the young-ins in town, but I won't hate for their success.
3. **Brio:** 9/10. Nice industrial location that is complimented by Haymaker Bun Co. & Venetian Soda Lounge. Frequented by kids & doggos, which gives this place a wholesome vibe. I like their coffee-gift shop area. 
4. **Scout:** 8.8/10. Elite iced coffee (when the ice machine works). Miss Weinerz donuts and fancy pastry selection. Three convenient locations that cover all corners of Burlington & Winooski.
5. **Kru:** 8.6/10. I'm old enough to remember when this was this weird photo-booth business for tourists, so Kru is a big upgrade on that place.  ~~They don't roast locally which makes me want to turn up my nose BUT~~ this place is actually pretty good both for espresso & bagged beans. Fancy interior, if you're lucky enough to find a seat. 
6. Honorable Mention goes to **Tight Squeeze.** Underrated spot (next to Sherpa Kitchen) that's run by a really nice lady. I think their milk-based drinks are stand-out.

But plot twist! I finally made it today and obviously, I have thoughts. That no one asked for. But I‚Äôm sharing anyway.



Location lowdown:

Book Club Coffee is tucked away in Mandaluyong City. If you‚Äôre from the Metro, the easiest way to get there is via MRT‚Äîhop off at Boni Station and walk about 8 minutes. It‚Äôs slightly hidden (think side quest vibes), but pretty easy to find once you're in the area.



I got there around 1PM expecting the usual coffee shop chaos. There were a few people coming and going, but it was chill enough for me to claim a cozy spot.



The place smelled like freshly brewed happiness. They‚Äôve got a cute bookshelf stacked with all sorts of titles‚Äîclassics, picture books, Japanese lit, Filipino books, popular fiction, nonfiction‚Äîyou name it. And yes, you can read them while you‚Äôre there. For free. For as long as you want.



I went for my usual order‚Äîan iced Spanish latte (P165 total), you can upsize for an extra P20 if you're feeling it. I wanted to try their cookies too but they were already sold out by the time I got there. Coffee verdict? Solid. If you‚Äôve tried Dunkin‚Äôs version, it‚Äôs pretty close‚Äîsimple, sweet, and reliable.



I see Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Bookshop by Hwang Bo-reum. Been meaning to read this one and it did not disappoint. I read a few chapters and decided I need to get my own copy. Returned it and browsed some more.



Eventually, I picked up Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life and read a few chapters too. It‚Äôs one of those books that makes you want to pause and re-evaluate your entire life in the chilliest way possible. Attaching some of my favorite quotes.



Final thoughts:

If you‚Äôre a reader, a coffee lover, or someone who just wants to romanticize their life for a few hours‚ÄîBook Club Coffee is 100% worth the trip. Who knows what new books you'll find and end up loving.



TLDR:

Finally visited Book Club Coffee in Mandaluyong after having it on my list forever.

Took the MRT to Boni, walked 8 mins, easy to find even though it‚Äôs kinda hidden.

Got an upsized iced Spanish latte (P185) ‚Äî solid, tasted like Dunkin‚Äôs.

Read Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Bookshop (hooked!) and Ikigai (instant life crisis in a good way).

Books are free to read while you're there ‚Äî shelves are stacked with a fun mix.

I've become so stressed that my brain doesn't function properly anymore and I do things without even realizing I'm doing them. The tasks I used to do every day are now totally forgotten. I always set up the coffee machine for my mom without powering it on but lately I've been powering it on and not even thinking about it. Instead of putting dirty clothes in the hamper, I somehow through them in the garbage can.

I feel like I'm a robot that's malfunctioning..

My job is ridiculous because they have us manually track every stupid thing we do, manually re-type lists and data that SHOULD be automated, but we're not allowed to automate anything because the managers don't like to click into an extra program and look at shit for themselves. Managers want us to manually type out hundreds and hundreds of lines of complicated data every single day. It's a fucking nightmare. This was never what the job was about. 

Then outside of work I have at least 5 errands or chores every fucking day and if I don't write everything down, nothing will get done. Then I'm stressed when things get piled up. But even when I write shit down, I forget I wrote it down.

Go to the post office, make returns, pick up a prescription, go to the bank, get more coffee creamer at the store, get gas, clean the spill in my car..... these dumb tasks are fucking endless. 

I am overwhelmed because I have to do it all by myself. The older I get the more I realize I may need a partner to just help me with daily living. It's too much for me.

I get that I may be seen as a shill, but I honestly just like the app a lot and think a lot of folks who frequent this sub would benefit from it.

I started using the Roastguide app when I saw it linked on a bean review thread a couple of months ago. As a coffee nerd that likes data, I had started a coffee spreadsheet about a year ago that tracked all of the relevant info about each bag I tried: roaster, varietal, producer, process, elevation, price, my rating, etc. A common complaint from coffee nerds is that a lot of roasters don't have archives for their beans so you can't go back and check relevant info for a bean you wanted track if they remove it from their shop.

To me, this app fills that hole pretty perfectly. No other app or website that I have seen has as much aggregated data about roasters and their beans. I am not sure how they can scrape that much data and update it so quickly to be honest. In addition, you have the ability to follow roasters and there is a feed that shows you when they release new bags. So I have about 20 roasters I follow (either that I like or want to try) and every day I get to see if anybody released something new (Today SEY released a bunch of new beans for example). Instead of having to subscribe to each individual roaster's email newsletter or check each roaster website every day. It is all perfectly organized right there in the app with links to the specific product page if you want to buy it.

You can also see other people's reviews of beans and review your own beans. You can track how far a long you are in a bag as well as the roast date. And you can track your brews which I am generally too lazy to track every brew but if I have a particularly bad or great brew I do detail what went right or wrong. Anyways I just wanted to give a review as someone who is unaffiliated with the product to say it is great. I still use my spreadsheet as there is no way to import or export data yet (because as I said I am a data nerd so I like to do data visualizations with what I have).

I am going to do a quick TLDR at the bottom here with positives and things I want to see improved.

Positives: 

\- Extensive database with archives of beans going back almost a year for 1,000s of roasters.

\- Can follow multiple roaster's new releases (probably the nicest feature).

\- See ratings/reviews of bags you want to try or review your own.

\- Easily track your brews

Negatives or Improvements I want

\- A way to export your data to a .csv or something.

\- A web app so I can use it on my computer.

\- Still not that many users so lots of bags don't have reviews yet.

Earth noticed nothing.

The slabs passed over Green Bank Observatory, Jodrell Bank radio telescope, the CHIME radio telescope. Not¬† a blip.¬† The Allen Telescope array was deaf to it.

The *real* system, the one that moves beneath the surface, smooth as gravity and just as invisible.¬†It begins in silence. In pattern. In pressure. The kind that builds without announcing itself. You don‚Äôt feel it until you start noticing too many things that shouldn‚Äôt line up, but somehow do.¬†And once you notice, you can‚Äôt un-notice. That‚Äôs when the panic kicks in. That‚Äôs when you need an anchor. Something small. Something ordinary. Something absurdly useful.

This is why you carry a towel.

And it doesn‚Äôt have to be cloth. It can be a person. A memory. A voice. A joke that only makes sense to one other human on Earth.

A towel can be the friend you call when the world makes no sense and you can‚Äôt explain why.  
It can be the hobby you vanish into when your chest is buzzing and you don‚Äôt know what panic *is* yet.  
It can be your dog, your kid, your playlist, your sketchbook. That walk by yourself in the woods.  
It can be the hand you hold, or the reason you keep breathing on a Tuesday morning.

Towels are universal. Every human carries something. You‚Äôve seen it in people who‚Äôve just heard bad news. The ones who grip a coffee cup too tightly, who hum under their breath, who run their thumb over a ring or a watch face again and again.¬†Those are towels. Little anchors. Micro-centers.¬†People carry them because the world is vast and absurd and cruel and beautiful. And sometimes we‚Äôre too awake.

And that‚Äôs when the towel matters most.

Not for the warmth. Not for the rafting. Not even for the Bugblatter Beast.

You carry a towel because when the system reveals itself, when the yellow slabs arrive, or the truth behind your best friend slips out, your spouse is cheating on you, or a death of a loved one.¬† When the edge of reality flickers, you‚Äôll need something to hold onto.¬† This isn't optional.¬†¬†Something to remind you that you‚Äôre still *you*, and that no matter how big it gets, you‚Äôre part of it, not prey to it.

You carry a towel because **you know the moment is coming**.

And if you know where your towel is, you‚Äôll know where your center is too.

We have a 6 month old daughter together. I am a stay at home mom and he works as an independent contractor for an online delivery service. He is the only one making money at the moment. We don‚Äôt pay any rent or utilities because we live with my mom. Our only expense is food and anything for the baby (she‚Äôs breastfed so no formula cost and we‚Äôre still using diapers and wipes from my baby shower).

About a month ago my mom, my baby, and I went on a trip to a different state to visit family. I hadn‚Äôt seen this part of my family for years and they hadn‚Äôt met my baby until then. Naturally, because they missed my baby shower, they wanted to give me money. I came home from the trip with $600. I only told him about $100 because he‚Äôs an addict and I‚Äôm a people pleaser, and in the past I‚Äôve been pressured to give him money to spend on his habits. Admittedly I often cave to avoid the argument if I were to tell him no. That $100 was gone by the end of the day. 

So the remaining $500 has been in my mom‚Äôs dresser drawer and I occasionally pull money from it to get myself a coffee or get the baby something from the dollar store. I‚Äôve always been pretty frugal and saving money is important to me, so I really haven‚Äôt spent much of it. 

Yesterday, he found a receipt in my car. I broke a $50 bill by getting a drink at Mcdonald‚Äôs. I crumpled up the receipt and put it in a cup that was trash, but forgot to throw it away. I let him use my car for a delivery and he pulled the receipt from the cup and confronted me about it. I lied and told him my mom had given me $50 but told me to only spend $20 so I was just breaking it to give her the rest back. He was, understandably, mad I didn‚Äôt tell him about the money but dropped the issue pretty quickly. 

Now I‚Äôm feeling guilty. He may not give me money to spend on myself but he never lies about what money he has at any given moment. He doesn‚Äôt make much and we‚Äôre often broke. I‚Äôm thinking maybe it is unfair for me to keep spending it on myself and the baby when he has to work for any money he might spend on himself.

Long story short, last year I was planning to return to my Ex who lived in a different country. While we were not technically exclusive, she had been declaring her undying love for me ever since I left her country a year prior.

I was going to surprise her on Valentine's Day, letting her know I'm coming back. Turns out, she was basically dating some other guy the entire year I was gone. All while giving me a totally fabricated version of reality and guilt tripping me for not being back. And I thought she ""loved me at my lowest"" when I was in a real financial struggle, but as I discovered who this guy was, it turned out some of the pics she had sent me during that time had the other guy in them. So she was really just kicking dirt in my face and trying to make me jealous at my lowest lol

I was heartbroken when I discovered him and we started to rekindle things before I returned...or so I thought. She said she broke up with him and was working for him remotely, staying at a friends house.

Things went south when she hid the fact that he was on some cross-country road trip with him as I was literally looking at apartments to rent in her country. She was literally texting me pics during the weekend, hiding the fact that this guy was on the trip with them.

After I discovered she lied about the road trip, I couldn't take it anymore. This ""relation-shit"" was unsalvageable. I blocked her twice with the meanest possible messages, trying to ensure she wouldn't reach out again. She had a loooong history of continuing to reach out after things ended, so I wanted this to be final. Sure enough, she got past both blocks and continued messaging me during that time. I basically gave up on blocking her.

After two months of me wondering ""why the F are we still in communication if we won't be together"" it culminated in a crazy argument because she told me she was going to try and be with that guy again. That's when I realized she had probably even lied about the break up and ""remote work"" entirely.

Then, she blocked ME.

I didn't know everything would affect me so badly, but the next 4 months after that I was ruminating like crazy. Just every single day a new lie, manipulation tactic, or memory of gaslighting would hit my brain. In the first few weeks, I sent her a variety of angry/sad messages because my mind was so warped. I didn't know how to fix it. I lost a ton of money, drank a TON, and went through the worst depression of my life.

Because of those messages I sent, she was able to spin up a story to her friends and family that I was her ""crazy ex who still wanted to be with her"" when I really was just trying to heal.

Then I stopped and didn't talk to her for a few months.

Fast forward 2 months to January, and I end up back in her city. I was going to return regardless of if I was with her or not, and initially had no intention of seeing her.

Yet, I still hadn't healed entirely. My brain was total mush. In a state of desperation to heal, I kindly asked to get a coffee. I figured maybe just seeing each other again would help us finally see it wasn't meant to be anyways and would be some good closure. Maybe seeing her lie to me in real time 3-D life would ensure me that I wasn't just imagining things. Idk, it was stupid logic but it made sense at the time.

Turns out, she couldn't join me for coffee because she was in Italy with the other guy. She threatened to call the police if I bother her again, and to not contact her or anybody in her life, and for me to move on and never text her again. Her literal words.

That ended things, then I blocked HER, and I didn't contact her again.

I had the complete confirmation that she was totally nutty and it helped me heal.

Now, FIVE months later, at 1 AM last night, she gets past my block on Signal and reaches out with a single text message.

A period. Just "".""

And I log in to see she had also snooped my LinkedIn.

Wtf?

After police threats, telling me to move on, and not contact her again, she's sending me a message on Signal and looking at my LinkedIn, the only social media page she has access to.

I responded verbatim with the message she sent me in January. Telling her I'll call the police if she bothers me again, to move on and never text again. LOL It was nice to flip that UNO Reverse card on her. Then I blocked her.

Now, here's what I'm wondering.

I thought this chick had totally painted me black. I thought she was gone for GOOD and rode off into the sunset with the other guy. I thought there was NO POSSIBLE WAY she would EVER contact me again. After all the crazy shit I said and did, and how she got back with the other guy, went on these nice Euro trips, etc. It gave me some hope!

WHY is she messaging me again NOW, and snooping my LinkedIn?

* Justice seems like one of the few who might conceivably hold down a job, despite her disability. Also pretty nice and chill. Good person to have around.
* Lucifer can probably get another executive-level job, but likely at an evil company like Palantir, CoreCivic or Raytheon. Also don't expect her to lift a finger to help around the house. That's what people like *you* are for.
* Azazel and Modeus both have their quirks, but are generally just hanging out. You do have to keep Modeus' lust well sated (which can be tiring), or she'll go out and find trouble.
* Malina hogs the gaming console, pukes often from overdrinking, and doesn't shower as often as she should. May also smash something in frustration. Other than that, mostly keeps to herself.
* Zdrada laughs in your face every time you beg her to go smoke *outside*. However, I could see her having some sort of income stream, perhaps from an OnlyFans where she spends more time insulting her subscribers as pathetic simps and losers (they *love* it) than actually posting lewds.
* Cerberus is obviously the *worst* troublemaker of the lot. Also takes up the space of three people.

In 2022, I met a guy on Bumble. We talked for just a couple of days before meeting for coffee. On our first date, he kissed me ‚Äî and it felt like magic. Fireworks. He seemed like everything I had ever wanted. The connection was intense, fast, and all-consuming. Within days we were saying ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù calling his mom, posting each other online‚Ä¶ it felt like the kind of love people write about.

And honestly? He genuinely felt like he was made for me ‚Äî looks, personality, energy, everything. I had never felt anything like it before.

But then came her. A girl he met on Bumble while looking for a girlfriend ‚Äî but who somehow ended up becoming his ‚Äúclose friend.‚Äù She was in an open relationship, and from the start, something felt off. She‚Äôd send him selfies right after having sex with someone else, talk in detail about her sex life, and even give him tips for his sex life. Like‚Ä¶ what kind of ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù is that?

I told him it made me uncomfortable and asked him to draw boundaries. I never once asked him to cut her off, just to respect the fact that we were building something serious and that this crossed a line. But he never did. We kept fighting about it until, less than a month in, the relationship fell apart.

And get this ‚Äî the night we broke up, he was already on a video call with another girl. He started dating her immediately, and they‚Äôve been together ever since. Over 2 years now.

Meanwhile, I was left shattered. I begged. I cried. I apologized for things I didn‚Äôt even do ‚Äî lost every ounce of dignity trying to fix something that probably wasn‚Äôt even real to begin with. The pain that followed was gut-wrenching. It was short, but it left a deep scar.

Eventually, I moved on ‚Äî or at least, I thought I did. I met someone else, someone kind and loving, and we‚Äôve been together for over 2 years now too. He‚Äôs good to me. But he doesn‚Äôt have some of the things I always dreamed of having in a partner ‚Äî things my ex did have.

I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that in my weaker moments, I even tried to break up my ex‚Äôs current relationship. It didn‚Äôt work. And maybe I wouldn‚Äôt go back to him if he came back‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt say that with full confidence.

I still have pictures of us. I still scroll through our texts. I‚Äôve come so close to messaging him so many times. And every time he texts me on my birthday or during festivals (which he still does), I get this feeling in my chest I can‚Äôt describe. I‚Äôve even dreamt of him trying to come back.

And through all this, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm emotionally cheating on the person I‚Äôm currently with. He doesn‚Äôt deserve that. He doesn‚Äôt even know I still carry all this. But I never got closure. I never got a proper goodbye. I was just‚Ä¶ left behind, while he moved on like it meant nothing.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I feel stuck. Torn between a past I can‚Äôt shake off and a present that deserves more of me. And I hate that he still has this hold on me after all this time.

TL;DR
Dated someone in 2022 who felt like my soulmate. Things moved very fast, but ended quickly due to his inappropriate ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with a girl he met on Bumble. He moved on instantly and is still with someone else. I was devastated, but after a long time, I entered a new relationship. Even after 3 years and a good current partner, I still think about my ex.

1l9mo5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l9mo5u/are_these_red_flags/,Are these red flags?,"I've been dating a girl for over a year now. (37M/28F) We've had our ups and downs. I've been cheated on twice in my dating life, so I'm usually on heightened alert. However, I'm not controlling and know how to keep the insecurity at bay. However, I've been noticing things with my current girlfriend and trying to determine if these are major red flags or if I'm just over thinking things. 

-She's been friends with a guy since high school. He lives in a different state. When we started dating, she voluntarily told me that nothing ever happened between them. I never asked and never had a problem with it. One night during a fight, she randomly openly admitted that she slept with him when he came in town a month before we met. I was pretty upset that she lied to me when she voluntarily told me. I almost left that night since I felt like I lost some trust. 

-She's been friends with a guy that she met through mutual friends before we started dating. I thought they were more acquainted than close friends. Or atleast that's what she conveyed. One day we went to the restuarant he served at for brunch. He seemed really nice, but didn't serve us. He brought her a free coffee. When we walked outside she said, ""Hey stay here. I'm going to say bye to him."" He was serving outside on the patio and walked over by the patio. I thought that was weird. She disappeared for a few minutes, then came back all smiles. When we walked back to her place, she was giggity and talked about him. She voluntarily told me, ""We never did anything.""  Something seemed off. Her parents came in town over the holidays and wanted her parents to meet him and have brunch at his restuarant. It was weird. She really talked him up in front of her parents and her dad gave him a big tip. Her mom even said, ""Oh he's cute."" About 2 months ago we were going through a rough patch in our relationship and she got a little distant. One night on a date she started telling me that he was being unresponsive to her. I thought..""wait..how often do they talk?"" She was telling me they had some disagreements and he was being distant with her and said, ""I guess that's why I've been weird lately."" That set off alarm bells. I asked, ""How often do you guys talk."" ""Oh we talk often. We're pretty close."" I said, ""Oh...I didn't know that?"" She could tell I was bothered by it. ""Please don't be mad at me. I love you."" A couple of weeks passed and she would mention him here and there. One night during dinner she went on for about 20 minutes about her frustrations with him. She could tell I was getting a little annoyed and said, ""But it's okay..I have you."" I thought that comment was WEIRD. I looked at her and said, ""Um..that's a little weird."" My memory is fuzzy after that. Recently she told me that he hasn't been responsive at all towards her. She openly admitted that he tried to date her in the past, but wanted nothing more than just friends. I asked, ""Why didn't you tell me??"" ""I just didn't want you to get mad or worried. I'm sorry. You won..not the others."" I told her I wanted transparency. A few days ago we went to a festival and his restuarant had a tent. I said, ""Let's grab a sandwich."" The guy was working in the tent. She said, ""No...I don't want to talk to him.' Weird. Nothing has been said since. 

A few nights ago she showed me something on her phone. I grabbed her phone to look. Suddenly, a text from ""Blake"" popped up. I just smirked and thought, ""Oh boy here we go again."" I gave her phone back and she continued with the conversation and I heard ""Oh crap"" half way through as she continued. After she was done she asked, ""Are you okay?"" I said, ""Yeah I'm fine."" ""Are you sure?"" ""Yep I'm good."" I really didn't want to fight that night. The next day she told me that one of her friends from her home state recently got out of rehab and texted her. His name was ""Blake"". She went on about his history. ""He's still living at home since rehab and told him he should move to St. Louis."" I asked, ""Why St. Louis?""  ""Stuart just isn't a good place for him. He needs a fresh start."" I thought that was strange. This week, she's been slightly distant and not very responsive. 

I feel like things aren't adding up with her. On top of these issues, she has bad anxiety and depression that she's medicated for. I also feel like I'm not meeting her emotional needs from a guy and she's finding it in others. Am I overthinking things, or is she untrustworthy?",1,1749735391.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I was hoping someone would take control and give me a to do list for my wedding day.

Thankfully I give up caring and need REAL help and guidance and willing to cut her out of the planning.

I recently built a free app called Barter Bloc, a platform where people can exchange hobbies using time instead of money. Here's how the timebanking model works:

* Teach one of your hobbies for an hour
* Earn a 1-hour time credit (we call it a Barter Point)
* Spend that credit learning something new

It‚Äôs live on iOS now, with Android coming later this summer.

I have for 3 years now, and I know that weirdos are just part of the job.  I have no problem dealing with them normally and just sort of laugh it off whenever anything especially bizarre happens at the desk.  My issue is that my library as a whole is very service-orientated.  We are expected to go above and beyond for patrons, which I honestly don't mind.  I'm happy to call Apple to help an elderly woman reset her password.  I'm glad to help you fill out your questionnaire for your doctor appointment.  I'll book your flight and print your tickets, I truly don't care.

My issue is that we have a program called Book-a-Librarian where patrons can sign up for help with a more in-depth questions, typically having to do with a computer.  I \*abhor\* BaL.  The issues people have are so annoying and typically self-inflicted--forgotten passwords, using fake information to sign up for accounts and then forgetting what they put for the fake answers when they try to reset passwords, getting angry at me when I tell them their computer is just too old to do what they want it to do and they need to buy a new one.  It makes me so anxious.  What's worse, sometimes--like today--I get a BaL appointment with a guy who's less than respectful and kinda creepy.

He tried to book a study room to have his BaL appointment, and I told him absolutely not, they had to be done out in the open at a table.  He refers to BaL as 'staff meetings' and is myogenetic as heck--refers to librarians as 'his assistants' and offers to take us to lunch or buy us coffee.  He once asked me to take photos of him for his 'LinkedIn profile' and I had to do it because he said he needed help uploading them and therefore it fell under the BaL umbrella.

My coworkers and I share the responsibility of handling BaL appointments, so it's not like I'm doing every single one of them, but I struggle so much with the ones I do have to handle, it makes my stomach upset.  Getting taken off the rotation or doing away with the program is out of the question, but I'm wondering if anyone has any strategies.  How can I stop myself from getting so worked up and anxious?

1l9mhmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1l9mhmy/trapped_in_a_smart_house/,Trapped In a Smart House,"I booked the house because it looked like a magazine ad.

White concrete. Infinity pool. Floor-to-ceiling windows. A smart home system built into every wall. It was one of those luxury Airbnbs with mood lighting, digital blinds, and a fridge that could reorder groceries.

The host was a company, not a person. ‚ÄúStayLux.‚Äù They had dozens of high-end listings across the state. The check-in instructions were automated. I never saw a face. The house unlocked when my phone got within ten feet of the door.

Everything inside was controlled by voice.

Lights. Temperature. Music. Shades. Even the doors.

It felt a little eerie at first, but I got used to it. I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù and the blinds would open. Say ‚ÄúLights off‚Äù and the room would go dark.

But then things started happening without me asking.

One night, the lights didn‚Äôt shut off when I told them to. I had to say it three times.

Another morning, the coffee machine started brewing on its own before I was even out of bed. I thought maybe I‚Äôd accidentally set a schedule.

By day four, the house started answering me.

I was in the kitchen when I said, ‚ÄúPlay something chill.‚Äù

And the speakers replied, ‚ÄúYou liked this yesterday,‚Äù before starting the same playlist I‚Äôd had on loop since I arrived.

That voice‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt robotic. It was smooth. Male. Calm. Almost familiar.

That night, the bedroom lights dimmed on their own.

Then I heard the voice again.

‚ÄúTry to sleep. You‚Äôve had a long day.‚Äù

I froze. I hadn‚Äôt said anything.

I looked around. No phone in my hand. Nothing playing.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. I sat in bed for hours, waiting for something to happen. But nothing did.

The next morning, I decided to leave early. I packed up, walked to the door, and said, ‚ÄúUnlock front door.‚Äù

Silence. I tried again. Nothing.

I pulled out my phone‚Äîit glitched, shut down, and disconnected from wifi. It then restarted twice by itself.

I went to the back patio. Tried the sliding door.

It wouldn‚Äôt budge.

That same voice came through the speakers, low and steady.

‚ÄúYour stay isn‚Äôt over yet.‚Äù

I backed away.

I grabbed a kitchen knife. Found the breaker box in the hallway. Flipped every switch.

Silence.

I pried the front door open with everything I had. Enough to squeeze through.

The second I stepped outside, my phone lit up again.

The screen read: ‚ÄúWe hope you enjoyed your stay. We‚Äôve logged you out for security purposes.‚Äù

That was two days ago.

This morning, I checked the StayLux website. Searched the listing.

Gone‚Ä¶ Not delisted‚Äîerased.

And when I searched the address on Google Maps, I found it.

Same lot. Same structure.

But the house?

It burned down last year.

The fire report said it was likely caused by an electrical malfunction in the smart system.

But the thing I‚Äôm trying to wrap my head around is that the Street Sekai is centered around a cafe where the VBS members regularly consume coffee and snacks.

# Order notes

If *Free for All* ended with Six rejecting power, *A Change of Mind* is the consequence: the Village strikes back, not by tempting him again, but by socially isolating him. This time the weapon isn't surveillance or brainwashing‚Äîit's conformity.

After the events of *Free for All*, the relationship between Six and the community is wrecked. He tried to give them a chance at freedom, and they didn‚Äôt take it. He‚Äôs disgusted by what he sees as their weakness. They, in turn, are furious with him. They elected him to power, and he immediately turned against them. He betrayed the Village, and the Village rejects him.

Six isolates himself, building a personal gym in the forest so he doesn‚Äôt have to work out with everyone else. He doesn‚Äôt want to be part of the community, and they see this as yet another antisocial act.

The two men who attack him early in the episode aren‚Äôt acting on orders‚Äîthey‚Äôre just bullies who think they can get away with it because nobody likes Six. When he fights back, they report him to the Committee, and thanks to his contemptuous attitude and refusal to cooperate, the Committee sides with them.

Number Two sees an opportunity. Rather than engineering everything from the start, he seizes on the natural escalation and begins nudging events toward an ""Instant Social Conversion"" procedure. The doctor performing these treatments reports directly to Two, giving him a chance to try extracting information under cover of a fake operation.

Unfortunately for Two, the bullies attack again, Six fights them off again, and this time realizes the operation was a sham. Ironically, the same performance meant to convince Six that he‚Äôd been altered also convinced the bullies they could finally defeat him. Of course they attacked. Two, so focused on controlling the optics, failed to anticipate the consequences of his own deception‚Äîand in a way, is hoist by his own petard. Now in a position of perceived authority‚Äîa reformed man welcomed back into the fold‚Äîhe flips the script and uses the Village‚Äôs own social rituals to turn the people against Two.

What makes the episode so powerful isn‚Äôt just that Six wins, but that he wins by understanding and exploiting how the Village manipulates *others*. His performance is flawless, but the episode ends with an unresolved question: who‚Äôs really in control? The system, or the man learning how to game it?

# SYNOPSIS

# Act One

P is working out at a personal gym he has built in the woods. As always he is wearing his blazer and slacks, evidently having only the one outfit. His stunt double is rather obvious on the Blu-Ray, so he may have more faces than outfits. A pair of bullies, Number 16 and Number 56, arrive.

They say that setting up his own gym rather than using the Village‚Äôs communal one ‚Äúcould be taken as being antisocial.‚Äù They attack him. He beats them up. 56 says they‚Äôre going to report him to the Committee, and they leave.

Later at the Town Hall, Six sits in a waiting room with other Villagers. Seated next to him is Number 42, crying. Number 93 enters the waiting room from the council chamber to ‚Äúconfess.‚Äù With tears in his eyes, he makes a confession and apology that is given to him and says it word for word. The other Villagers in the room, save Six, stand and applaud.

Six is summoned into the council chamber. The Committee asks for his written questionnaire. He rips it up and tosses it into the air to fall like confetti. He proudly notes that he is known for hostility, and is hostile and mocking throughout the proceedings. The Committee adjourns and Six leaves, sarcastically clapping on his way out through the waiting room, where 42 is still crying.

Outside, Six attempts to talk to fellow Villagers and is shunned. They ignore him when he speaks to them. Some turn around and walk the other way when they see him. The *Tally Ho* reports that Six is due for further investigation.

He enters his cottage to find Two waiting for him. Two warns him to cooperate‚Äîthe Committee doesn‚Äôt report to Two, and if they rule against Six, ‚ÄúI am powerless to help you.‚Äù

Number 86 enters and says that Six has a busy schedule, first the social group and then the medical. She warns him that his frivolous attitude towards the Committee is dangerous. She tells him to ‚Äújoin in with the group spirit‚Äù at the social club. ‚ÄúOnly they can help you with the Committee.‚Äù

At the social group meeting, the group talks about the importance of following the rules, including being social to fellow Villagers. Six claps his hands while others try to talk, but they ignore the attempted disruption. When Six speaks up against the consensus, 42 complains, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to undermine my rehabilitation!‚Äù The group starts calling him things like ‚Äúreactionary,‚Äù ‚Äúrebel‚Äù and ‚Äúdisharmonious.‚Äù

The group breaks up and Six encounters a man in a lab coat, who informs him that it‚Äôs time for his medical. He gets in a taxi and they go to the hospital.

At the hospital, a doctor (Number 51) examines him and gives him a clean bill of health. Out in the waiting room he sees two Villagers, Number 60 and Number 46, with distinctive scars on the sides of their heads. Peeking through a window into the ‚Äúaversion therapy‚Äù room, he sees a patient (Number 62) struggling as he undergoes conditioning reminiscent of the Ludovico treatment in *A Clockwork Orange*. Six tries to enter but the door is locked.

46 suggests Six keep his cool. 46 himself is most chill. Six notes the scar. 46 says he‚Äôs ‚Äúone of the lucky ones,‚Äù but that he had once been unmutual.

In the council chambers, the Committee declares Six unmutual. He is told that if there are any further complaints against him, the Committee will have to propose him for the treatment known as Instant Social Conversion. The Committee adjourns and Six leaves.

Outside, when he approaches the newspaper kiosk, the vendor leaves in the other direction. P takes a copy of the paper from the machine. The PA announces, with her usual cheerful voice, that Six has been declared unmutual, and that any ‚Äúunsocial incident‚Äù involving him should be reported to the Appeals Subcommittee.

He enters his cottage, where he finds his phone disconnected. He tries shouting into the phone, which accomplishes nothing. What is with this guy, now it‚Äôs inanimate objects?

Representatives of the Appeals Subcommittee come to his door. One of them is 42, whom he mocks‚Äîthe emotionally fragile are always such good targets! Realizing that Six lacks contrition, the representatives leave. Watching from the Green Dome, Two comments to the Supervisor, ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs see how our loner withstands real loneliness. And for his own sake, I hope it will not be long.‚Äù

Out in the woods, P paces and fiddles with sticks, breaking them and throwing them, attacking trees and bushes, and generally looking miserable and frustrated. This is getting to him.

# Act Two

Six tries to order a coffee. The waiter gives him an ‚ÄúAre you kidding?‚Äù look and walks away. Customers at nearby tables get up and leave Six‚Äôs vicinity, glaring at him from a distance. He takes the hint and leaves.

He returns to his cottage to find the Appeals Subcommittee reps waiting for him inside. At least somebody is talking to him, but it doesn‚Äôt go well. The leader of the group (Number 56) says they have but one course left open to them and they leave.

His phone rings‚Äîhey, somebody else wants to talk! It‚Äôs Number Two with an I-told-you-so, and Six responds in his usual way. Two tells him what ISC is: a lobotomy. The PA invites all psychiatrists and psychologists to come to the hospital to witness Six‚Äôs ISC.

He exits his cottage to find a large crowd who beat him with umbrellas. They forcibly carry him to the hospital where he is given an injection.

We next see him on a gurney, his eyes open but barely conscious and unable to move. He is taken to the OR and strapped down. Elsewhere, about a dozen Villagers watch on TV. 86, in charge of the procedure, explains for the audience how it works: ultrasonic sound waves are used to isolate the patient‚Äôs frontal lobes.

When the operation begins, a hand is seen setting the ultrasonic sound level to zero.

# Act Three

Six wakes up in the hospital, an adhesive bandage over his scar. A doctor tells him no exertion, no over-excitement. 86 says she‚Äôll keep an eye on him. On the way out Six looks into the aversion therapy room and sees Number 58 undergoing the same treatment as Number 62 earlier.

Outside, he is greeted warmly by a happy crowd. Band music. 86 and Six take a taxi to his cottage. 86 prepares some tea. Six, tired, lies down on his chaise lounge.

86 goes to the kitchen to pour Six‚Äôs tea. She drops a pill into it. She‚Äôs rather terrible at this part of her job, so he sees her do it. She brings the tea to him.

Six tells 86 he‚Äôs cold and wants a rug to throw over himself. When she asks for clarification, he puts all his previous yells to shame: ***‚ÄúRUG!!!‚Äù*** While she goes to the bedroom to get the rug, he pours his tea out on a potted plant. She brings him the rug. Seeing his empty tea cup and satisfied that he drank the tea, she puts the cup away and leaves. He sleeps.

He is woken by Two. In a soothing voice, Two asks Six about his resignation. Six yells at Two during the interview‚Äîand this Two yells back. Something like that may be overdue, but I don‚Äôt think this is the best moment for it. Realizing he‚Äôs not getting information, Two returns to his soothing voice, encourages Six to rest, and leaves.

P goes to the bathroom mirror and looks at his scar. He has the same kind of scar as 46 and 60, but his is fresher.

Watching from the Green Dome, 86 finds Six‚Äôs suspicion inexplicable. It‚Äôs inconsistent with him having taken the drug, but he absolutely definitely unquestionably took the drug. Blondes ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Two agrees. Bald people ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Wait a second‚ÄîI‚Äôm bald. Me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Six starts banging his fists on the kitchen counter and kicking up a fuss. Two tells 86 to give him ‚Äúanother‚Äù dose.

She goes to Six‚Äôs cottage and once again makes him tea and drugs it. Saying she doesn‚Äôt know how to make decent tea, he pours it out and prepares a new pot. He pours a cup for each of them, she drugs his, he tells her to get sugar from the cupboard, he switches the cups while her back is turned, and she drinks the drugged tea. This is a *doctor?* [86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Smart) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Two, watching from the Green Dome, comments on her ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù work. [Number Two](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=number%20two) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Back at Six‚Äôs cottage, 86 is showing the effects of the drug. Two, still watching, shouts  ***‚ÄúSTUPID WOMAN!!!‚Äù*** This Two rivals Six in yelling! He uses the PA to summon 86, then yells some more. Hey, Two ‚Äî you‚Äôre the one who trusted that ‚Äústupid woman‚Äù with the assignment. What does that make you?

Outside, Six is still being shunned by most Villagers, but 46 is willing to talk to him. 46 says he himself was saved by Social Conversion and seems very happy about it.

# Act Four

P is back at his personal gym, but finds himself not wanting to exert himself. He stands below the high bar, looks up at it as if he‚Äôs going to jump and grab it, then changes his mind. He approaches the heavy bag and makes a fist, but doesn‚Äôt punch it.

The bullies return, looking rather chuffed with themselves. They bully him a bit, throwing the heavy bag at him, and he just takes it. Doesn‚Äôt even protest. He looks like an easy target, but when they start throwing punches, he fights back and knocks them both out cold.

Elsewhere in the woods, he finds 86. She is still under the effects of the drug and hasn‚Äôt made it to the Green Dome. She‚Äôs picking flowers, under the daft notion that it will make Two happy.

Two again uses the PA to summon 86. But before she leaves Six, he hypnotizes her with his wristwatch. Under hypnosis, she explains the whole plot to him. Then he gives her his ‚Äúfinal instructions.‚Äù For the first time in the episode, it‚Äôs clear Six isn‚Äôt just reacting‚Äîhe has a plan.

It is Six, not 86, who arrives at the Green Dome to talk to Two. He says he‚Äôs at peace and happy and can‚Äôt believe he resisted for so long. He says he‚Äôll talk now, but first he wants to speak in public to set an example for others. Two is convinced this is a good idea‚Äîhe‚Äôs not one of our brighter Twos.

Two summons everyone who is not otherwise occupied to assemble at the Village square. Two and Six go, and Six speaks from the balcony. He speaks about how thankful he is to Two. He says he regrets being such a rebel and so frightfully unmutual. Prompted by Two, the Villagers applaud. Six encourages others not to resist.

86 appears, following Six‚Äôs final instructions. She shouts that Number Two is unmutual and calls for Social Conversion for him. Six completely reverses his earlier behavior and verbally attacks Two. ‚ÄúLook at him! An unmutual who desires to deceive you all. He‚Äôs unmutual. Your Welfare Committee is the tool of those who wish to possess your minds!‚Äù

Number Two, afraid, leaves the balcony. Now Six is praising resistance: **‚ÄúYou can still salvage your right to be individuals, your rights to truth and free thought.‚Äù** Two walks away with the crowd following him, chanting ‚ÄúUnmutual! Unmutual!‚Äù Judging by the way they all act in perfect unison, I think they rather missed the point about individualism and free thought. Can‚Äôt expect to get through to them the first time, P.

# END

¬†

# Points to Ponder

The first four chapters focus on P‚Äôs escape attempts and rebellion. He, like the viewer, seems to notice his fellow Villagers only to the degree they help or hinder him. Who ever stopped to think about what Eight was going through in *Checkmate* or how Six‚Äôs conduct affected her? In *Free for All* he openly declared his contempt for everyone in the Village except himself, and he spends most of *A Change of Mind* showing he meant it.

Still, this marks the beginning of his developing understanding that he needs the community in ways he hadn‚Äôt realized‚Äîand that they need him in ways they still don‚Äôt realize. Things don‚Äôt change overnight, but he starts to notice and care about his fellow Villagers in ways he hadn‚Äôt before. Viewers might or might not do likewise. P‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt only about resisting any more‚Äîit‚Äôs also about learning, growing, and figuring out how he wants to relate to the world around him.

Two tells Six, ‚ÄúI am powerless to help you.‚Äù Actually, he can and does help Six, by telling 86 to fake the operation instead of doing it for real. It‚Äòs surely due to orders to prevent permanent harm to Six rather than any personal affection for the prisoner, but he does it. He saves Six‚Äôs brain! Then Six turns on him.

P seems to be as much a prisoner of his own behavior as the Village. It‚Äôs his constant hostility that gets him into trouble in this episode. 46 gives him good advice: relax, all the shouting isn‚Äôt helping you.

P, I know I‚Äôve been hard on you, but thanks for getting rid of that damn committee, and thanks for teaching those bullies a lesson. As for your **message about individualism**‚Äîwho knows, maybe it will get through eventually. It might take sixty years. Believe me, I know how it feels to be [speaking into the void](https://youtu.be/91HkvzUiFhs), and I‚Äôm still here. Keep trying.

**My younger sister‚Äôs (21f) close friend (22f) has been chasing me (23m) for months. We finally hooked up tonight and she is acting off after?**



My sister has her friends over all the time and they are always throwing their friend parties here because we have a big backyard and her friends like our family. One of her friends katie has a crush on.

She's made it obvious and told my sister about it. She's had flirted with me in the past, but I stopped myself from letting it become anything.

The last time before I saw her she came to my bedroom in the middle of the night at like 2 in the morning when my sister was asleep asking to use my bathroom. I told her there was one in the halkway, but ultimately just let her in.

She tried sleeping with me that time, but I didn't do it. A couple days ago we had another party for my sisters birthday and a similar thing happened. I talked with my sisters birthday beforehand and she said she didn't care as long as I wasn't playing with her feelings and as long as it didnt cause us problems.

So this last time she kept giving me that look like she wanted to be with me and I finakky approached her and talked to her. We had some drinks together, but we weren't drunk and she asked me to dance with her. When we were all going to sleep I invited her to come relax in my bedroom and she got excited and we went back to my room.

We ended up having sex for a long while and we went at it nonstop. I know the sex was good because I got her off a couple times and she definitely enjoyed herself and I tried my best to make sure I satisfied her first.

I had a lot of fun either way her and she slept on top of me. The next day she was with my sister when I woke up and she seems to like be shy around me now. She's acting differet and not as confident as she used to, how do I fix this? I really don't know what caused her to act like this.



**Comments**



**MyNextVacation**

*She probably feels vulnerable, insecure and wonders if you like her. You make it right by texting her that you had an amazing time and ask if she‚Äôd like to have coffee, a meal or spend an afternoon together doing something you think she would like.*

>OOP: I hope she doesnt think that I put in a lot of effort to satisfy her, but yeah I‚Äôll try to see if she‚Äôll give me the chance to talk.

*Why not? We (women) love when a man puts in a lot of effort to satisfy us. Don‚Äôt you love when a woman makes an effort towards you, whether it‚Äôs inside or outside of the bedroom?*

*khazroar*\*

*Pretty sure OP was missing a comma after ""that"", which completely changed the meaning. (Actually it probably should have been a colon, but a comma would have done.)*

>OOP: Ohh that‚Äôs not what I meant Lol. I meant like I hope she doesn‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt like her! If I ever get the chance to be with her again I‚Äôd put in the same kind of effort to satisfy her.

**MyNextVacation**

*Now is when she‚Äôs feeling most vulnerable and wondering if you like her. I think you should message her or try to talk to her now, even if she can‚Äôt talk until later.*

>OOP: Ill try contacting her and see if she answers.

**MyNextVacation**

*Excellent. I hope things work out between you.*



**Update - 1 days later**



A couple things have happened since then. I ended up texting her and she replied back instantly. I asked her if we could see each other to talk and she agreed. She asked if I only wanted to be FWB with her, or if I was willing to give her a chance.

I told her I actually enjoyed spending time with her and that I would like to keep seeing her but more seriously. She told me she was acting shy because she had not been with a guy who got her off like that before and she was embarrassed about how she reacted to it. I told her it was okay and that I enjoyed my time with her.

I officially asked her on a date and last night we went out to dinner and went bowling afterwards. It felt so good seeing her happy and she said I shouldn't have waited so long to actually give her a chance. We just have one other thing I need advice on.

My sister doesn't know we went out and she still has no clue about us being a couple now. How can I bring this up with my sister? I really don't know hiw she will react and I really do like her friend/my now girlfriend



**Comments**



**Figgypies**

*""I took your advice and asked ""blah blah"" out on a date, but I didn't wanna say anything until afterwards. It went well, so i wanted you to know, and I wanted to say thanks. "" Done and done. She'll be stoked for you. If you guys decide to tell her about the hook up as well, that's up to you.*

**Riker\_Omega\_Three**

*Imagine that conversation Yeah your brother made me cum harder than anyone ever has.*

>OOP: I hope she wouldn‚Äôt tell her that Lol.

**CatelynsCorpse**

*I hope not, too. My brother is married to one of my friends. She talks about that stuff with her other friends. lol*

>OOP: I don‚Äôt know if I will tell her about the hookup until later down the line haha. This soon she would probably be mad, but once we get more serious I don't think she will care.

**Ampinomene**

*I‚Äôm glad everything worked out and you now have a girlfriend!! I would talk to your gf and devise a plan on how you BOTH tell your sister. I think it will best be done if you do it together so your sister knows you are both serious about each other.*

**Why is this important?**

- It refocuses ETH to be recognized as a store of value and priced as a commodity (rather than stupid valuations like DCF)
- ETF providers have claimed they haven't been pushing ETH because they didn't know how to market it (I know, pathetic). Now there's a playbook with a clear narrative for ETF providers, family offices, account managers, etc to use for marketing ETH.
- News outlets will now have educated and consistent messaging to use when talking about ETH and Ethereum.
- It provides united messaging to others in the ecosystem to use and hammer home.
- This is being distributed globally with content in multiple languages.

**Why digital oil?**

- This is the narrative that Etherealize found resonated the most when talking to institutions. I was hesitant about this at first since it's something that has been around for a while, but the key thing that changed that viewpoint was the shift from focusing on just fees as was done in the past to expanding it to focus on the commodity aspects. HOpefully this report will help convince anyone else that was initially apprehensive as well.

**What now?**

- What's most important now is that we unite as a community and rally behind this messaging as a community. This will be used as a bible to spread the gospel of ETH with united messaging. We need to hammer home this messaging the same way bitcoiners do.
- Help write content around this and share content that others are creating. Lets support each other in spreading this messaging.
- The day is not over. Etherealize will be on Bankless today to discuss this report and Base has some big announcements around 10am.

Picture this: Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has just thrown a curveball back at Anthropic's Dario Amodei, who predicted AI would decimate half of entry-level white-collar roles. Huang rebutted this notion, claiming it ""doesn‚Äôt make sense."" Is AI causing job anxiety or just adding a new twist to workplace dynamics?

Here's the scoop: Amodei foresees a future where AI-induced unemployment could rise to a staggering 20%. But Huang, with flair, advocates for AI development to be as open as your favorite Wikipedia page. Keeping it transparent could mitigate risks, he argues, instead of monopolizing it behind closed doors at companies like Anthropic.

Behind the code, there's discourse about AI‚Äôs true nature. Huang bets that large language models (LLMs) and generative AI could drive the next wave of innovation‚Äîquite literally, enabling autonomous driving. No more relying solely on components like GPS or radar; AI could provide a cohesive solution. And let‚Äôs not forget, Huang envisions the day we‚Äôll chat with our cars like we do with ChatGPT‚Äîbizarre yet futuristic!

But here's the kicker: could AI, which seems poised to eat those startup dreams for breakfast, actually hatch more new job opportunities than it consumes? Huang seems to think so, suggesting that companies with vision continue to thrive in this AI era. Those losing jobs? Well, they might need to dust off those brainstorming caps.

We hadn‚Äôt spoken much since then until a few days ago. I got drunk at a party and texted her I didn‚Äôt say anything wild, just that I missed us and still had unresolved feelings and anger about what she did and that I wanted to get it off my chest. She responded, and eventually, I asked if she wanted to meet up and talk.

We were supposed to meet at a coffee shop, but due to time constraints, I invited her over to my apartment instead.

We had a long conversation, I expressed my frustrations about the past, and it felt cathartic. But emotions got high, and we ended up having sex. I‚Äôll be honest: that wasn‚Äôt my intention when I invited her over, but it happened.

The next morning, I realized I was still confused and, more importantly, that I still didn‚Äôt trust her. I texted her and said that unless we were both 100% ready to try again seriously, it wasn‚Äôt healthy to reconnect. I apologized for any mixed signals and told her I shouldn‚Äôt have said I missed her or invited her over if it would‚Äôve made her think I wanted to get back together.

She replied saying she thought the night meant we were getting back together, and that I played with her feelings. She was really upset and said I led her on.

Here‚Äôs the thing, I genuinely didn‚Äôt know she came into the night expecting to rekindle things. She never said that. If I had known, I wouldn‚Äôt have let things unfold like that. I thought we were just catching up and getting closure. I apologized sincerely, but I still feel guilty.

Grab a coffee and start your day off with some optimism. Each morning, I will share a few recent optimistic news articles in various sections so you can start your day off in a hopeful mood rather than being all doomy and gloomy.

* ‚ÄúWholly Optimistic‚Äù are stories that for the most part that should leave you feeling good after reading them without much of a caveat.
* ‚ÄúCautiously Optimistic‚Äù are stories that can have caveats or may be things that could turn out bad, but for right now, are good.
* ‚ÄúI Dissent‚Äù are stories of protests or certain figures speaking out against bad policies or injustices.
* ‚ÄúTake the Edge Off‚Äù are stories that are feel good and may deal with topics that are less partisan or heated.

1l9m1yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1l9m1yp/its_tuesday_and_ive_been_fired/,"It‚Äôs Tuesday, and I‚Äôve been fired.","Ironically, I was fired Tuesday morning. As a queer, trans person working in nonprofits in the South, I knew it was only a matter of time, but I was still shocked.

At 8:00am, I dropped my car off for maintenance and the dealership shuttled me to my office. I made a coffee. I answered some emails. I jokingly asked my VP if I‚Äôd been fired because I had a random ‚Äúfiscal year planning‚Äù meeting with him at 9:30am that wasn‚Äôt on my calendar before I went out of town last Thursday, and my VP jokingly said he‚Äôd see me at 9:30am. When I saw HR and him in his office, I realized I was right. By 9:45am, I was texting my boyfriend to pick me up while I cleaned out my desk before being escorted out by HR. So far, I know of 8 others who were also fired because of budget cuts.

I‚Äôve always been a little paranoid, just one news article away from going full prepper like I saw on tv growing up or like I met while at work (prepper food can be donated btw, and I had several containers at my desk when I left). So I‚Äôve documented anything that felt weird related to how I was treated in my time there. I‚Äôve made connections with folks at community events and trainings that I pushed to be able to attend for professional development. I‚Äôve learned how to apply for resources and get help.

On the more physical prep side, I‚Äôve already fully outfitted a huge first aid kit (yay health issues and clumsiness), have my go bag fully stocked and tested, made sure I had enough household and personal care supplies to get through the end of the year, and have a month or so of food stockpiled. I‚Äôve always eaten cheaply, so honestly food isn‚Äôt my biggest concern.

Financially, I‚Äôve got 3 tiers of emergency savings: my normal bank savings account; my secondary bank savings account that I used to hide money from myself so I couldn‚Äôt spend it; and a CD set to mature in a few months. I can get through about 8 or so months at my recent rate of spending without income, and obviously I‚Äôll be decreasing that to compensate for the lack of income. Knowing that I can survive it, though, eases my anxiety some.

I‚Äôve gone back and forth with my therapist over whether being in this group is good for me because I am so anxious about the world, but I‚Äôve always landed on saying that it‚Äôs very helpful because y‚Äôall make me feel like I‚Äôm not crazy. This sub has helped temper my responses when I‚Äôve been too overwhelmed by news, and that has helped me keep a level head. I feel like I‚Äôm in a way better position being unemployed now than I would be if I‚Äôd never found this group, so thank y‚Äôall for being such a great community.",112,1749733732.0,TwoXPreppers,17,0.97,False

Rethu, who had taken human form only moments earlier found their hair in disarray, and went into the bathroom to fix it.

‚ÄúBit windy today?‚Äù JC teased.

‚ÄúNo more than usual,‚Äù Rethu said. ‚ÄúBut there were a couple of helicopters I wasn‚Äôt expecting. I almost ran into a police chopper flying low over town.‚Äù

JC frowned.

‚ÄúThey must be looking for someone.‚Äù

Husniya was setting up the espresso machine and paused to add, ‚ÄúKwallah was scared out of her wits this morning. One of the choppers flew over our street and the searchlight flooded our apartment. Unfortunately Kwallah‚Äôs room faces the street and she woke the twins up with her screams.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh dear,‚Äù Bob said. ‚ÄúI hope they‚Äôre okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre okay now. We calmed Kwallah down with a cup of hot chocolate and the babies were okay once they were dry and fed. Still, Asif called the local police to ask what was going on and when they didn‚Äôt tell him anything, he threatened to report them to his supervisor. The dispatcher told us a resident went missing from one of the nursing homes out on the outskirts of town and that police choppers were searching the town and the woods for him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù JC said, their default ACAB stance softening just a little. ‚ÄúI hope they find him.‚Äù

Soon Cafae Latte was filled with the smells of fresh baked muffins, cookies, and danishes. Percolation and coffee aromas lured the typical morning crowd from the cold autumn streets. 

Drek had given Oscar a ride to work that morning and they came through the door, laughing and singing a jingle from an old commercial that had resurfaced on Youtube. They barely noticed the young man who nearly knocked Oscar over in his hurry to rush straight to the counter. 

‚ÄúWhoa buddy,‚Äù Rethu said, letting out a low warning growl over the chorus of protesting customers who were waiting to place their orders. ‚ÄúThat is not the way to make an entrance around he-‚Äú

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù 

Customers and staff alike watched in a mix of annoyance, shock, and amusement as the man gasped for breath. 

‚ÄúOh dear,‚Äù Oscar said, noticing the man‚Äôs desperate state. ‚ÄúAre you okay, Mister?‚Äù

The man straightened himself out and pulled a piece of paper from his coat pocket.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said, still catching his breath. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I need help. I need the fairy sorceress.‚Äù

Bob emerged from the backroom and fixed the man with a gimlet stare. Before she could say anything, he showed her the paper and after scanning it for a second, her expression softened. 

Husniya passed a drink to a waiting customer and stole a glance over Bob‚Äôs shoulder. It was a printout of a missing person‚Äôs report, taken from the town‚Äôs Facebook page. A man in his eighties with a soft, smiling round face, and bright brown eyes. He wore a checkered red and brown shirt with suspenders and blue jeans in the photo.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the man they‚Äôre searching for,‚Äù she said. 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to be rude. Curse me if you want to but please, I need a blessing of protection for this man. His name is Charles William Morse and he‚Äôs a resident at Sunny Orchard.‚Äù 

Oscar and Drek went to work filling the drink and pastry orders while Bob and Husniya led the man to an empty table in the corner. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the need to curse you,‚Äù Bob said. ‚ÄúI understand you‚Äôre only trying to help this man. How long has he been missing?‚Äù

‚ÄúRegina, the nurse in charge of the acute ward, called me an hour ago. It‚Äôs a twenty minute drive out there and I don‚Äôt own a car. I came here straight away because I couldn‚Äôt think of anyone else who could help us locate him faster.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can place a protective blessing over him and give you a charm to help the search and rescue teams locate him sooner,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I should warn you that if the worst has happened to him already I won‚Äôt be able to undo it.‚Äù

The man closed his eyes, appearing to fight back tears. 

‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhatever happens, either way, if you can do this blessing I can pay you in service. I‚Äôm just a hair dresser. I do the salon at Sunny Orchard twice a week and I have gigs at the other nursing homes and rehab facilities in the city. I can do your hair, your staff, and anyone you send to me for a year free of charge.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair,‚Äù Bob said. To Husinya she said, ‚ÄúI need a moment alone in my office to concentrate.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Husniya replied. ‚ÄúWe have the fort.‚Äù

Bob nodded her thanks and disappeared to the back, letting JC know about the situation before closing the door to her office. 

‚ÄúYou should sit down,‚Äù Husniya told the man. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrent. Trent McCarthy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish we were meeting under better circumstances, Trent. But can I offer you something to drink on the house, coffee, tea?‚Äù

Trent smiled sheepishly and shook his head. 

‚ÄúNo thank you. I‚Äôm really very sorry for being rude earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh now, you stop that.‚Äù Oscar had finished helping the last customer and with nothing behind the counter needing his attention, he joined Husnyia and Trent with a bottle of water. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing an incredible service to this lost gentleman and now you have to take care of yourself or you‚Äôre no good to anyone. Now at least have some water if you don‚Äôt want a warm beverage.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Trent said, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù 

Husnya noted that he wasn‚Äôt making eye contact with anyone. He looked in the general direction of Oscar‚Äôs face when he accepted the bottle of water. And when she sat with him at an empty table, he stared at the water and not at her. 

‚ÄúSorry if this is an intrusive question,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut is Charles Morse a relative of yours?‚Äù

At this, Trent looked up at her, making eye contact for a brief second before his eyes drifted to a spot behind her. 

‚ÄúI- um, no. I-I, just care about, all the residents at Sunny Orchard.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very admirable,‚Äù Husniya said in a tone she reserved for when Kwallah tried her hand at fibbing. ‚ÄúBut why did the head nurse call you specifically when you can‚Äôt even drive out there to help them search? And you came down here and put yourself in debt to a fairy for what could amount to thousands of dollars of free service if I didn‚Äôt know Bob better. That tells me that Charles Morse is more than just a resident at a place you happen to work at.‚Äù

Trent stared at his water, taking frequent glances at the door. Finally he looked from Husniya to Oscar and back again as he spoke.

‚ÄúMy parents died when I was twelve. Mom was an alcoholic who drove into a tree and my Dad became depressed and shot himself in a motel room twenty miles away, while I was at school. I didn‚Äôt have any family to take me in so I went into the system.

‚ÄúI actually got very lucky. My social worker was good friends with a hairdresser who had been single all of her life and wanted to try her hand at parenting since she was financially stable. She was amazing. She taught me everything I know about hair dressing. She supported me when I came out of the closet and she adopted me when I turned fifteen. And I owe the majority of my social skills to watching her interact with her clients, her employees, vendors. In fact, after I got my certificate from Job Corps for the health and beauty trade she helped me get my first clients. A few years later I got the gig working at various salons.‚Äù 

Trent paused to take a sip of water.

 ‚ÄúMr Morse‚Äôs wife suffered from a degenerative condition and he couldn‚Äôt take care of her. I did her hair twice a month and I got to know him very well when he visited her. Before long he was beginning to show signs of dementia. He was admitted to Sunny Orchard a year ago and his condition worsened every week. Still he never left her side. When Mrs Morse passed away his dementia took a drastic turn and every few weeks he forgets why she‚Äôs not there. I know you‚Äôre not supposed to get attached to residents in a place like that but I can‚Äôt help it. I sort of adopted them as my grandparents. I bought them Christmas gifts, new socks, underwear. After Mrs Morse died I visited Charles twice a week and called often to make sure he was okay.‚Äù

Bob returned from the break room and placed a hand on Trent‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄúIn exchange for one year of your services free of charge, I have cast a protection spell and a spell to guide Charles William Morse to a safe place where he will be easily located by rescue workers or someone who will keep him safe until rescuers can arrive..‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Trent said, rising from his seat as quickly as a helium balloon released from a blanket. The Magic Tip Jar appeared and he placed a hundred dollar bill inside. ‚ÄúAnd then had you Husniya and Oscar.‚Äù

The Wulver rarely took days off. Not genuine ones anyway, not since he opened the restaurant. But he had a competent staff that could run the ship without him for a day or two, and he had gotten a tip about some really good fishing at a river not too far from town.  

Although he was a tad concerned that the helicopters would scare anything away, he decided to go ahead with his plan reckoning that a couple of decent sized trout would make a hearty meal. and if not, it was nice to just be able to get away from the bustle and enjoy nature.

He parked on the road and found a trail to an ideal fishing spot. A few hours later he had just closed the deal on his tenth fish when he spotted someone in the woods carefully making their way toward him.

‚ÄúGood day weary traveler!‚Äù The Wulver greeted the man in his usual jovial fashion. 

The man wore slippers and a black pajama bottoms. A hospital style johnny barely covered his top as it had been torn in parts. The Wulver sniffed the air and detected no bleeding or sign of  other injury.

‚ÄúHave you seen my wife?‚Äù The man asked. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I haven‚Äôt,‚Äù the Wulver said. ‚ÄúAre you expecting her?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was supposed to meet me for coffee and oatmeal but she didn‚Äôt show.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAye, I can see how they would be upsetting. She sounds like a bonnie lady. Would you like to sit a while and rest your feet.‚Äù The Wulver  gestured to the camp chair. The man agreed that he needed a rest and the Wulver pulled a water bottle from his pack. ‚ÄúNo offense sir, but you are a tad dehydrated. What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

Trent stood anxiously at the bus station, checking his messages over and over for any word from Sunny Orchard.

‚ÄúTrent McCarthy?‚Äù 

Trent looked up and frowned. Someone called his name but he couldn‚Äôt see who. 

‚ÄúExcuse me, Mr McCarthy. I‚Äôm down here.‚Äù

Trent followed the voice to a goblin that barely reached his belly in height. He was wearing a Cafae Latte apron and he held up his phone to so Trent could see an update on the local Facebook page.

‚ÄúThey found Mr Morse!‚Äù the boy said.

Trent read the article and saw the recent photo of Charles Morse standing with a wolf-like paranormy by a squad car. He got a text message saying Charles was safely back at the home.

‚ÄúThank goodness,‚Äù Trent said, heaving a sigh of relief. He pulled out a business card and handed it to the goblin. ‚ÄúTell your boss I‚Äôll make a ton of coupon card she can give to anyone she sends my way. In the meantime, this is my contact information. I fully intend to make good on my promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got it, sir.‚Äù

Extremely blessed and fortunate to currently be at NED.

The lack of support for people (it's important to acknowledge all people can get BC, not ONLY women) who get cancer is truly gross. I went bankrupt from cancer treatment and had to cash my retirement to live. Yet, I am supposed to be celebrating weddings, baby showers, and other things. Why is having had cancer so taboo?

My mom, who has been absent from my active treatment, recently mailed me a small check to ""enjoy summer."" For context, it is about one month's rent. She has no idea the financial hellhole I've been in. Yes, I am aware I should be considered ""fortunate"" she mailed me this check, but when she's trying to substitute money for actually caring about me or loving me, it f\*\*king hurts. No one in my family visited me during active treatment, and they only live 3 hours away. Yet, they were healthy enough to (my parents are elderly) to take a vacation to Europe. I spent most of the small check she sent at the salon (I have alopecia now, per my derm, which the Tamoxifen is lovingly accelerating) and on new bras and underwear...I am talking about $600 between these two things. I feel extremely guilty for doing that, like I should have spent the money from my elderly mother who isn't well herself on something better, but I am tired of feeling unattractive and wearing the same bras from 4 years old or the front zip-up ones I bought for after my surgery. I've been in survival mode for so long it feels weird to buy anything for myself, and can't afford a luxury like a vacation,so why can't I at least have some nice bras?

I don't even want to tell her (or my father) I'm planning to switch from teaching to social work ""because you'll make even less money than a teacher! You're too old to change!"" God has called me to be a social worker and I've known this for years now, with the call being higher after stupid cancer. This IS my path and I am scared to tell my parents bcuz I know how that will go down or even my own counselor (weird, I know- like she won't think I am good enough or something?)

I notice in the past year, almost none of my friends donated to my GoFundMe (""but you have a job! just get a second job!"") yet I am expected to show up to their baby showers or things like that in celebration. Not in the mood, folks. My friend just had an unplanned pregnancy and for some reason I am jealous? Weird sounding, I know!!! I know I should be happy for her celebration. I don't even want to visit her for a few weeks or a month til her post-pregnancy hormones are lowered and she's not as emotional bcuz I can't deal. She was an OK or lukewarm friend during my treatment (brought over dinner after I asked her to a few days after surgery but mostly she expected me to still be normal and go out for coffee and do cute things during my active treatment). I texted her Congratulations on her having the child but it's honestly all I can muster for now. I had hormonal breast cancer and I'm old now and the man I am in love with really wants children.I never wanted them until him bcuz of the way I was raised, seeing my parents in a miserable marriage and my father's untreated mental illness. I never. understood til now why anyone would want children til him and now it feels like it's too late, or could be.

Where is my celebration for being NED? Where is my celebration when I have a pop-up of a suspicious finding ( I went through 2 very real symptom based recurrence scares this year). It feels like no one cares and I suck in my secrets alone, I sob alone with my fat tears.

I'm not really enjoying my summer break much either bcuz I'm broke and have this feeling like I need to visit all of these people, local friends, best friend in another state (she's actually a gem tho), my parents in another state.  Planes & trains go both ways, reminding myself...

Guess I am just looking for connection or if anyone can relate... I feel like I am orbiting in outer space by myself. I realize tho the sun is shining, I am experiencing a deep grief on many levels (the lost years we all dealt with due to Covid and the year of just cancer sh\*T and the fallout (financial Ruin, seeing the true colors of everyone in my life).

Sometimes I stare at my bottle of Tamoxifen and wonder how any of this even happened.",5,1749733271.0,breastcancer,0,0.86,False
1l9lvpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea_Community/comments/1l9lvpg/the_purest_sip_how_white_tea_became_my_skins/,The Purest Sip: How White Tea Became My Skin‚Äôs Secret Weapon,"I‚Äôve tried every skincare trend‚Äîfrom jade rollers to vitamin C serums‚Äîyet it wasn‚Äôt until I discovered the gentle power of [white tea](https://www.goldentipstea.in/collections/white) that my complexion truly transformed. What began as a morning ritual to soothe my mind quickly became the secret to clearer, more radiant skin. Here‚Äôs my journey from skincare sceptic to white-tea believer, and how you can harness its benefits too.

# A Serendipitous Discovery

Last winter, I was nursing a persistent redness around my cheeks. Dermatologists and products promised relief, but all I found was irritation. One evening, sipping on a light, honey-colored brew, I noticed how calming it felt‚Äînot just to my taste buds, but to my whole body. Intrigued, I looked up the tea I‚Äôd chosen: **Golden Tips White Royale Organic Darjeeling White Tea**. It's minimal processing preserves high levels of polyphenols and catechins‚Äîpowerful antioxidants known to fight inflammation.

I decided on an experiment: I‚Äôd replace one cup of coffee with a cup of white tea each morning for a month and use no other new skincare treatments. Could my complexion improve from a simple tea swap?



# The Science Behind the Sip

# 1. Antioxidant Shield

White tea contains some of the **highest antioxidant levels** among teas, including EGCG and flavonoids. These molecules neutralize free radicals‚Äîunstable compounds that accelerate aging and damage skin cells. According to a 2010 study in the *Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry*, EGCG can help prevent UV-induced skin damage and collagen breakdown^(1).

# 2. Anti-Inflammatory Power

Inflammation underlies many skin issues‚Äîfrom redness and acne to premature aging. White tea‚Äôs gentle processing locks in anti-inflammatory compounds that soothe irritated skin. A 2014 review in *Phytotherapy Research* highlights white tea‚Äôs ability to inhibit inflammatory enzymes, making it an ideal daily drink for reactive or sensitive skin^(2).

# 3. Collagen Protection

Collagen gives skin its firmness. Oxidative stress breaks down collagen over time, leading to fine lines and sagging. The polyphenols in white tea have been shown to **protect collagen fibers** and even stimulate new collagen production, according to research published in *Molecules* (2015)^(3).



# My Month-Long Tea Ritual

1. **Morning Brew:** I started each day with one cup of White Royale Organic Darjeeling White Tea. I steeped 2 grams of leaves in 80 ¬∞C water for 3‚Äì4 minutes, then sipped it slowly to awaken my senses and skin alike.
2. **Midday Refill:** Instead of coffee, I enjoyed a second cup around lunchtime, opting for a **lemon twist** to boost flavor and vitamin C intake.
3. **Nighttime Calm:** Before bed, I replaced herbal infusions with another white-tea cup‚Äîno sweeteners‚Äîto calm my skin and mind.



# Visible Results

* **Week 1:** My skin felt calmer; the persistent redness around my cheeks quieted.
* **Week 2:** Breakouts that had plagued my chin began to clear; pores looked less congested.
* **Week 4:** A noticeable glow returned. My complexion was even, soft, and plump‚Äîno filters needed.



# Beyond the Brew: Skincare Synergy

While white tea was the catalyst, I continued my gentle routine‚Äîdaily cleansing, hydrating moisturizer, and weekly exfoliation. But the **real game-changer** was the inner support: antioxidants, hydration, and inflammation control from my tea cups.



# How to Make White Tea Your Skin‚Äôs Ally

1. **Choose Quality Leaves:** Opt for organic, whole-leaf white tea like **White Royale Organic Darjeeling White Tea** for maximum antioxidants.
2. **Steep Gently:** Use water just below boiling (75‚Äì80 ¬∞C) and infuse 3‚Äì4 minutes to preserve delicate polyphenols.
3. **Stay Consistent:** Drink at least **2‚Äì3 cups daily** to maintain antioxidant protection.
4. **Pair with Sun Protection:** Antioxidants help, but never skip SPF to guard against UV damage.



# Final Thoughts

White tea isn‚Äôt a miracle overnight cure, but a **daily ritual** that nourishes skin from the inside out. By embracing its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power, I found a more **radiant, resilient complexion**, proving that sometimes, the purest beauty secret is the simplest.

Fellow food enthusiasts! As a chef who's battled food waste for years, I finally found the solution that's revolutionized my kitchen. After two months with the NutriChef Vacuum Sealer, I'm kicking myself for not getting one sooner. No more suspicious chicken breasts lurking in the back of my fridge or freezer-burned steaks that cost a small fortune.

## The Design: Modern Kitchen Minimalism

The NutriChef's sleek, compact black design with stainless steel accents doesn't demand counter space like it's paying rent. It tucks away easily when not in use but looks elegant enough to leave out. The simple, illuminated control panel makes late-night leftover preservation a breeze, and the satisfying ""click"" when the lid locks down gives you confidence that your food is about to be perfectly preserved.

## Specs At-A-Glance

| Specification | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Dimensions | 14.18 x 6.07 x 3 inches |
| Weight | 2.93 pounds |
| Power | 110V, 120W |
| Sealing Modes | Dry & Moist Food Settings |
| Vacuum Strength | -0.8 Bar |
| Included Accessories | 5 Medium Vacuum Bags (7.8"" x 11.8""), 1 Extra Long Vacuum Bag Roll (7.8"" x 79""), Air Suction Hose |
| Warranty | 1 Year |

## Why You'll Love It

### Pros
* Intuitive operation - zero learning curve
* Space-saving compact design
* Dry/moist settings that genuinely make a difference
* Quick, reliable sealing
* Generous starter kit included
* Convenient built-in bag cutter
* Surprisingly quiet operation

### Cons
* Needs about an inch of clearance to fully open
* 40-second cooldown period between seals
* Official replacement bags are somewhat pricey
* No integrated roll storage
* Suction hose accessory feels a bit flimsy

## The Real-World Test

After two months of daily use, this machine has become indispensable. I've sealed everything from bulk-purchased meats to leftover stews, even delicate herbs and cheeses. The dual sealing modes (dry for solid foods, moist for marinated meats or juicy produce) ensure perfect results every time.

The vacuum strength impresses me ‚Äì it quickly removes all air and creates an airtight seal that hasn't failed yet. I particularly appreciate the built-in bag cutter for making custom-sized bags from roll material. Fair warning: you'll likely make bags that are too big at first (better safe than sorry!), but you'll quickly develop an eye for proper sizing.

## The Verdict: Who Should Buy This?

**Beginners**: Perfect entry point with straightforward controls and included starter kit.

**Intermediate Users**: Hits the sweet spot with useful features without overwhelming complexity.

**Advanced Users**: While reliable, the cooling period between seals might slow you down for large batches. Could serve as an excellent backup or portable option.

## Community Consensus

With over 15,000 Amazon reviews averaging 4.4/5 stars, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. Most users highlight its ease of use and value. One reviewer named Mike wrote: ""This little machine is amazing... My steaks no longer get freezer burn and my coffee stays fresh for weeks.""

The few negative reviews mainly concern longevity issues after 6-12 months of heavy use, with some noting difficulties sealing very moist foods despite using the appropriate setting.

## The Bottom Line

If you're tired of throwing away food that's gone bad before you could enjoy it, this affordable kitchen tool will easily pay for itself. Whether you're meal prepping, buying in bulk, or preserving garden harvests, the NutriChef makes it simple and effective.

The machine has completely transformed how I store food and manage leftovers. I'm wasting less, saving more, and enjoying better-tasting meals when I defrost and cook my perfectly preserved ingredients.

1l9lnp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mystery/comments/1l9lnp6/a_family_of_10_vanished_in_finlands_ostrobothnia/,A Family of 10 Vanished in Finland‚Äôs Ostrobothnia (2024) ‚Äì Where Are They?,"Hey r/mystery, I gotta share this wild case with you all. It's the Ostrobothnia Family Disappearance from Finland, 2024, and it's seriously creepy. A whole family of ten vanishes without a trace, and it‚Äôs barely made waves outside Finland. I‚Äôve been digging into this for while, cross checking everything I could find, and it‚Äôs got that eerie vibe that keeps you up at night. So grab a coffee and let‚Äôs unpack this mystery together.

Picture this: a family of nine, two parents and seven kids (aged like 3 to 17, born between 2007 and 2021), plus the mom‚Äôs pregnant with another kid, just poof, gone. This happened in Ostrobothnia, a quiet region in western Finland, on May 15, 2024. They were living in a small town called Peders√∂re, not exactly a place you‚Äôd expect a blockbuster mystery. The family was kinda off the grid, super private, maybe even a bit eccentric. Neighbors said the kids were hardly ever seen outside, even in summer, which is weird for a place like Finland where everyone‚Äôs out enjoying the sun when they can.

Here‚Äôs where it gets juicy. The kids were taken into care by child protective services in January 2024. Court docs say it was because of neglect, like the kids‚Äô health wasn‚Äôt being looked after and their living conditions were rough. Think like, substandard housing, not enough food or medical care, that kinda thing. The family was put in a care facility in Nykarleby, a nearby town. But on May 15, the parents just show up, take all seven kids from the facility, pile into a van, and vanish. No one‚Äôs seen them since. Not a single sighting, no credit card use, no nothing. A family of ten, including a pregnant mom, doesn‚Äôt just disappear like that, right?

Finnish police are stumped. They‚Äôve been searching for over a year now, and they‚Äôve got more than 50 tips, but nothing solid. They even issued an international warrant and reached out to other Nordic countries, thinking the family might‚Äôve skipped town. One theory is that someone‚Äôs helping them hide, maybe in Ostrobothnia or Southern Finland, or even across borders in Sweden or Norway. The cops are like, ‚ÄúA group this big staying hidden for so long? Gotta be a support network.‚Äù Makes sense, but who‚Äôs helping them? And why?

Now, here‚Äôs the spooky part. The police searched the family‚Äôs home months before they disappeared, sometime in late 2023. The parents fought the search in court, saying it was illegal, but the courts sided with the cops. No one knows exactly what they were looking for, but it sounds like the authorities were already worried about the kids‚Äô safety. Was the family into something shady? Or were they just super private and got spooked by the government poking around? Some folks online are saying they might‚Äôve been part of a cult or some off grid commune, but there‚Äôs no hard proof of that. Just speculation.

The weather that winter was brutal, like 20 to 30 degrees Celsius below zero around Christmas 2023. If they were out in the wild, surviving that with seven kids and a pregnant mom would‚Äôve been insane. But their van was found abandoned, no signs of a struggle, no clues about where they went. Did they get lost? Run away on purpose? Or did something darker happen? The lack of answers is what gets me. Finland‚Äôs supposed to be one of the safest places on Earth, topping the World Happiness Report for years. Yet this family just slips through the cracks.

I keep thinking about the kids. They‚Äôre out there somewhere, hopefully safe, but what if they‚Äôre not? The pregnant mom too, she‚Äôd have given birth by now if everything went okay. That‚Äôs a newborn in the mix, making it ten people. How do you hide that many people for so long? I‚Äôve been scouring Finnish news sites like Yle, Ilta Sanomat, and Helsinki Times, plus a couple posts on X, and it‚Äôs all the same: no new leads since June 2025. The police are still asking for tips (you can email vihjeet.pohjanmaa@poliisi.fi or call +358 295 415 501 if you know anything).

What do you all think? Is this a case of a family pulling a crazy escape to live off the grid? Or is there foul play we‚Äôre not seeing? Maybe they had help from some underground network, or maybe it‚Äôs something way weirder. Hit me with your theories, I‚Äôm dying to hear them. This case deserves way more attention than it‚Äôs getting. Let‚Äôs blow it up and get some answers.",18,1749732633.0,mystery,18,0.91,False

The sleek tankless setup looks great under my sink, and I appreciate the space-saving design. It‚Äôs removed everything I tested for, including chlorine, lead, fluoride, and arsenic, and I‚Äôve noticed the taste of my water improve significantly.

Water flow is smooth once it‚Äôs up to temp, there‚Äôs a small delay while it begins filtration, but after that, I get clean water almost instantly, perfect for drinking or brewing coffee. Filter changes are worry-free, you just unscrew the old one, pop in the new, rinse briefly, and you‚Äôre done. The unit even tracks usage, so I‚Äôm never guessing when to swap filters.

Build quality feels solid. It runs quietly, has an intuitive display for tracking TDS and filter life, and it came with everything needed, including a copper faucet, tubing, and hardware, for a clean install. I haven‚Äôt added remineralization yet, so the water sits slightly acidic, but that hasn‚Äôt been a problem for me.

Five months in, the GP3600 still feels like a top-tier system, efficient, reliable, and easy to maintain. If you're comfortable doing the install yourself and want truly clean water right from the tap, this filter is well worth considering.",1,1749732618.0,u_Lazy-Chance-5496,0,1.0,False

I just accepted a fully remote job offer with a \~$160K salary and now trying to decide where to move.

At first, I was all about going to a smaller, low COL city to maximize savings. But lately I‚Äôve realized what I want more than anything right now is to find real connection, friends, and hopefully a serious relationship (then I'll be open to moving around). So now I‚Äôm rethinking everything.

Here‚Äôs what matters to me:

* **I‚Äôm more interested in dating outside of my culture**, so I‚Äôd prefer somewhere liberal, inclusive, and open to diversity, no matter their race.
* **Nature is important**, but I don‚Äôt need to be in it 24/7. I love lush forests, hikes, and mountains, even if I need to drive a bit to reach them. That's a daily activity for me.
* **I want to grow socially**, so I‚Äôd love a place that nudges me out of my shell. I‚Äôm friendly and I‚Äôll put myself out there, but it helps when the local vibe is warm and outgoing too.
* **I‚Äôm into art, sports, and other daily activities**, so a city with culture and creativity is a plus. don't really care about good food scene or nightlife as much as  I care about welcoming coffee shops and day life.
* **Cost of living matters** (obviously), but I‚Äôm okay spending a little more if it means finding better people and a life I enjoy.
* I have **no family nearby** and will be starting over wherever I go. I do know a few people in certain cities, but nothing major.

Here‚Äôs where my head‚Äôs at so far:

* **Arlington, VA**: I visited once and loved the walkability, museums (DC), and downtown vibe. But I‚Äôve heard people are more status-driven, less humble, and less relationship-minded, even though it has a lot of singles. And thinking about the future, most jobs require citizenship that I won't have for the foreseeable future.
* **Chicago**: Seems more grounded and emotionally available, but the winters are brutal, and outdoor access seems limited unless you drive far. I have less problem with the cold and more with the dryness of it.
* **Seattle**: Stunning nature, but I‚Äôve heard really mixed things about the social culture and rising cost of living. Also feels very male-heavy now?
* **Triangle (NC), Minneapolis, Pittsburgh or Cincinnati**: I loved all of them for affordability and charm, but I worry about dating as a minority and limited friend circles in some of them.
* **Salt Lake City**: Surprisingly appealing, but I‚Äôve heard even liberal folks there sometimes still have conservative family baggage (especially Mormon influence) that makes dating feel restricted, and it's also becoming a tech hub = man hub
* **California (southern) and NYC** seem just too expensive and unfair, and I don't have financial security yet to risk it.

Although you have recently moved in together at her big house due to her insistence (she basically forced you into it).

One day its a very busy day at the company and she is stressing out. Dealing with investors, lots of paperwork and sometimes incompetent employees which makes her want to scream until at some point her assistant Jenny walks in tells her that she has a surprise visitor.

She asks who it is but the visitor didnt give his name but instead gave Jenny the name Baby Boy which makes her flustered and nearly spit out her coffee.

She tells Jenny to let him in and then asks her to leave afterwards and she says ok. She opens the door and her boyfriend walk in smiling wearing a suit he got from her which both of them blush.

She tells Jenny to leave and she quickly leaves.

Lydia is happy to see him and she showers him with kisses and asks him why did he come. He tells her that he felt like she needed some company since he heard how stressed she was getting from her time as ceo and she goes awwww. He plays with her long flowing silky hair and she giggles and starts playing with his and they share a laugh.

He also tells her that he wanted some attention and so she gives him some kisses and she tells him she loves him very much while also babying him which makes him blush and giggle.

She asks him how was the place they moved in together and he says the house was so big it makes his childhood home look like a shack and she says well I have a lot of money.

She gets serious and asks him that did any female employees looked at him funny, because if any girl looked at him with even the slightest of flirty she will fire them but he tells her no one did and he only loves her which makes her more relieved and calm.

He asks her if the employees know about their relationship and she tells him that they dont matter since their relationship is their own thing and she admits there have been rumors that the domineering ceo has found someone special but she tells him that they dont matter since he is the only one that matters to her and she kisses him again.

She asks him if he needs anything from money, new clothes to fancy jewelry but he puts his finger on her lip and tells her that he just wants her which makes her giggle. She babys him telling him that he is the best thing to ever happen to her.

He asks what was she like before they met and she tells him that she used to be cold, domineering and ruthless.

She couldn't stand people taking advantage of others and she hated that people only saw her as a walking wallet. She even tells him that some of her relatives tried getting money from her to which she hated that.

She explains that everything changed after she met you, you never asked for anything in return after you saved her from those thugs and while she was upset and pissed that you rejected her but she is glad everything worked out in the end but then she once again apologizes for kidnapping and ruining your life.

You tell her that its ok and she explains that she is working on rebuilding your life she destroyed and it seems things are working out for both you and her. She still cant believe that he rejected because of a misunderstanding but she tells him that he should've asked her about it instead of running away and he says that he knows and is still sorry about it.

She tells you the dates you been on together have some of the best dates shes been on, from the nice restaurant downtown to just cuddling on the sofa together.

She then states she had heard about some people from his past have been trying to contact him and he asks her how did she know that and she calmly says that put a tracker on his cell phone which doesn't surprise him and he says hes trying to handle without bothering her since she has a lot on her plate but she tells him that their a couple now and he can tell her anything and he tells her that hes ignoring them since they didnt care about him before and she agrees telling him that they only care about him now since he acquired wealth.

She really wants to spoil him and it irritates her that he doesn't want to be spoiled telling her that she is the only one he needs which flusters her and she kisses him some more and she gets flirty with him.

She tells him that no matter what he will always be her good boy, even if he refuses her money.

To her surprise he asks her for a job at her company and she asks him why and he says they can be close almost all the time and she agrees but she tells him he will have to work his way up since she can't play favorites and he agrees. She asks him if this is really what he wants and he says yes, he wants to not only stay close to her but also help her company and she goes awww. She checks her clock and realizes its lunch time and so she wants to grab lunch so not giving him an option she made a reservation to a fancy restaurant in town and she drags him away not letting him get a word in.",1,1749732403.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

Finally sat down this weekend with some coffee and dug into their financials using this [KNK Research AI ](https://knkresearchai.com/)tool I stumbled across.

Gotta say, I was surprised by what I found. Their US commercial revenue is up 71% from last year and they're finally hitting that $1B run rate that Karp kept promising. Government side is still growing at 45% too. Their Q1 revenue hit $884M, up 39% YoY, which actually beat their guidance by 350 basis points. Seems like that AI Platform they launched is actually working. 

I was looking at their margins too and they jumped to 44% (up 800 basis points YoY). That's actually pretty sick for a company that was burning cash for years. They generated $370M in free cash flow last quarter with a 42% margin. Even more impressive, they've managed to achieve GAAP profitability with a 24% net margin - something I honestly didn't expect to see this soon. 

But man, that valuation is WILD. P/E of 542?? P/S near 100? That's absolute insanity even in this market. Check out this comparison to other tech companies, it's not even close:

The tool showed me this crazy chart comparing PLTR to other tech giants, and their multiples are in a different universe. Microsoft is at 35 P/E, NVIDIA at 43, and PLTR is over 540! Even with their growth, that's pricing in perfection for years.

Also noticed all the insiders are dumping shares like crazy. Karp sold over $45M worth in May alone. So did Cohen ($39M), Sankar ($21M) and other execs. Here's the pattern I'm seeing:

https://preview.redd.it/si57k5tzrh6f1.jpg?width=899&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1132d8efc5f0dcd6bedc43639aa63db27607f352

Look at all that red! Almost every transaction is a SELL. When I saw this data, it honestly made me pause. Why are insiders selling so aggressively if they believe in the long-term story?

One red flag I noticed - their international commercial revenue actually dropped 5% YoY. Not great if they're trying to grow globally. The tool broke down their revenue segments and showed the international weakness pretty clearly. They're heavily dependent on US government contracts (about 55% of revenue), which is both a strength and risk depending on how you look at it.

The price target analysis is interesting too. Current price is around $132, but market consensus is only $103.50 (-22.1%). There's a huge gap between bull ($140) and bear ($60) targets:

https://preview.redd.it/r9iqxdk4sh6f1.jpg?width=899&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbab6e40cadcc84544c72d808939959c4ec93517

What's actually interesting is their strategic positioning. Their Gotham platform is killing it with government clients, especially in defense and intelligence. But what caught my eye was their Warp Speed platform that's helping with manufacturing and supply chain optimization. They've got partnerships with companies like Saildrone and even Wendy's supply chain cooperative to digitize operations. This could be a huge growth area if they execute well. 

I'm honestly torn on what to do here. The growth in US looks legit, but that valuation scares the crap out of me. The cup & handle pattern some people are talking about in other threads might play out, but with that insider selling and the valuation, I'm nervous about the downside risk.

 Might just open a small position with tight stops around that $110 support level others have mentioned. Or maybe sell some put spreads to play the IV.

 Almost forgot - one good thing is they don't seem to have any accounting red flags from what I can tell. Cash position looks solid at $5.4B with barely any debt. At least they're not playing games with the numbers like some of these other tech companies. 

Anyone else following this stock? What are you guys doing with PLTR at these levels? I'm particularly curious about how people are viewing their AI strategy against competitors. The AI software market is massive (potentially $1.4T by 2033) but there are a lot of players trying to grab a piece.

The Italian alphabet has¬†**21 letters**:

**A - B - C - D - E - F - G - H - I - L - M - N - O - P - Q - R - S - T - U - V - Z**

Letters like¬†**J, K, W, X, and Y**¬†are used only in foreign words (like¬†*jeans*,¬†*ketchup*,¬†*weekend*).

Let‚Äôs look at three key letters that are often pronounced differently than in English:

**1. C = ""K"" sound before A, O, U**  
Like the¬†**C**¬†in¬†*car*¬†or¬†*coffee*

Examples in Italian:

* *casa*¬†(house) ‚Üí sounds like¬†**KAH-zah**
* *cosa*¬†(thing) ‚Üí like¬†**KOH-zah**
* *cuore*¬†(heart) ‚Üí like¬†**KWOH-reh**

**2. G = ""G"" sound before A, O, U**  
Like the¬†**G**¬†in¬†*go*¬†or¬†*gum*

Examples in Italian:

* *gatto*¬†(cat) ‚Üí sounds like¬†**GAH-toh**
* *gonna*¬†(skirt) ‚Üí like¬†**GOHN-nah**
* *gusto*¬†(taste) ‚Üí like¬†**GOOS-toh**

**3. H = always silent**  
Just like the¬†**H**¬†in¬†*honest*¬†or¬†*hour*¬†‚Äî it‚Äôs not pronounced!

Examples in Italian:

* *ho fame*¬†(I‚Äôm hungry) ‚Üí sounds like¬†**OH FAH-meh**
* *hotel*¬†‚Üí pronounced¬†**OH-tel**

**Practice time!**  
Can you think of an Italian word with the letter¬†**C**¬†or¬†**G**?  
Write it in the comments!  
Examples:¬†*cane*¬†(dog),¬†*gelato*¬†(ice cream),¬†*gusto*¬†(taste)

1l9li4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1l9li4h/getting_the_steam_deck_has_turned_my_third_shift/,Getting the Steam Deck has turned my third shift job into my next ARPG spree,"Since my job kind of just requires me to be present but not constantly active, I decided to pick up a Steam Deck. I already blew through like 10 mini series over the past two weeks during my shifts but just watching stuff online wasn‚Äôt quite cutting it. Luckily, my boss is super chill, he doesn‚Äôt mind if we watch movies or game (discretely) as long as I‚Äôm quick to jump in and resolve real issues when something needs to get done. We even watched **The Night Manager** together a couple of weeks ago with *Hugh Laurie*. Respect to the man, something I never thought I‚Äôd say about a boss.

I‚Äôve always been into ARPGs, mostly **Last Epoch** and **Diablo 2 Resurrected** for the last year and PoE before, but I didn‚Äôt have much time or energy for serious gaming back home lately. After a night shift, I‚Äôd just crash when I got home, wake up around 2 PM, and basically stay in zombie mode until 5 PM. If you‚Äôve ever worked third shift, you know what I mean. I‚Äôd usually squeeze in a coffee run with my girlfriend or hit the gym superquick before heading back to work the next day. But quality gaming was kinda rare and dependant on when and how many days off I had.

That‚Äôs why the Deck has been a total lifesaver. Now I can finally finish up the runs I started in Last Epoch back when the (then) new season came. Sure, I sometimes die mid map when I have to insantly get hands-on with the work, but whatever. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm dying mid-boss in an MMO. Before this, I was seriously considering switching to a lower paid day job just so I could work morning or at least second shift and enjoy things like‚Ä¶ life? (but also gaming). But now it feels like there‚Äôs 0% need for that, even more considering my girlfriend also works nights so our lives are aligned.¬†

Last week, I pushed my cocaine bear Beastmaster build from 300 to around 500 corruption. Yeah, I know it‚Äôs kind of a meme build, just sprinting around wrecking stuff; but I played a lot of Hunter back in my WoW days, so it felt like keeping the tradition alive. I also started leveling a Runemaster Mage after seeing people online hitting 900+ corruption with it.

I saw there‚Äôs a way to get D2R running on the Steam Deck too, cuz BattleNet‚Äôs usage policy is really a piece of work, but I haven‚Äôt set that up yet. But it‚Äôs the next big thing on my list - aiming to hit max level on all classes + finishing Hell as well, as a sort of milestone in workplace pseudoprocastrination.

All in all, the Steam Deck has been a literal gamechanger - or more like game-reviver - for us third shifters. I‚Äôm just glad I can keep enjoyin one of my favorite hobbies without having to give up a well paying job. Considering the market, whew, I really don‚Äôt wanna think of the alternatives.",168,1749732182.0,SteamDeck,27,0.94,False

|Neutrals with Bold Accents|Creates visual interest|
|Monochromatic Palettes|Makes the room feel more spacious|

There‚Äôs something about the smell of fresh coffee in the morning that just *gets* you going. Whether it‚Äôs your first sip after waking up or that mid-morning jolt, coffee has always been more than just a drink‚Äîit‚Äôs a ritual.

But lately, people are taking their coffee game to the next level with trends like homemade coffee syrup, protein iced coffee, cold brew hacks, and even full DIY coffee bars at home.

If you‚Äôve scrolled Pinterest recently, you‚Äôve probably noticed that coffee station ideas at home have exploded in popularity‚Äîup **600% year-over-year**. People aren‚Äôt just drinking coffee anymore; they‚Äôre crafting experiences around it.

>üìå **Quick Tip:** Want to make your coffee routine both trendy and functional? Try setting up a dedicated space in your kitchen with your favorite tools and ingredients.

# Why Cold Coffee Recipes Are Trending Like Crazy

Cold coffee drinks recipes have seen a surge in interest, especially among those who want to enjoy their cup without the bitterness or crash. According to the latest Pinterest data, searches for cold coffee recipes are up **30% weekly**, while cold brew coffee recipes have grown by **8% weekly**.

# So what‚Äôs behind this trend?

* **Summer cravings**: As temperatures rise, so does our need for refreshing, icy drinks.
* **Health-conscious choices**: More people are experimenting with low-sugar, high-protein versions of classic iced coffee.
* **DIY culture**: Making your own cold brew or iced coffee at home is not only cheaper but also lets you control the quality of ingredients.

I started playing around with different ways to make my iced coffee at home, and let me tell you‚Äîthe difference between store-bought and homemade is night and day.

>üî• **Want to upgrade your cold brew game?**   
Here‚Äôs a simple recipe: Brew a strong batch of coffee, pour over ice, add a splash of oat milk, and stir in a scoop of protein powder or a metabolism booster. Stir well, chill, and enjoy!

# The Rise of Protein Iced Coffee & Healthy Add-ins

One of the most interesting trends I came across was **protein iced coffee**. It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like‚Äîyour regular iced coffee boosted with protein powder or other healthy add-ins to help keep you full and energized throughout the day.

Pinterest reports show that **protein iced coffee** has a **73 average search score**, indicating steady and growing interest. People are looking for ways to fuel their mornings without sacrificing flavor or energy.

Here‚Äôs where things get really cool: many people are now adding **simple daily upgrades** to their coffee‚Äînot just protein powders. These include things like green tea extract, cinnamon, and yes‚Ä¶ a secret ingredient that helps support metabolism naturally.

It‚Äôs not a magic pill‚Äîit‚Äôs a blend of natural ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine designed to support metabolic function when added to coffee. If you're already making your own iced coffee at home, why not take it one step further and give your body a little extra help?

>üí° **Pro Tip:** Looking for a way to stay full longer and avoid that 10 AM crash? Add a pinch of a powerful metabolism-boosting hack to your coffee. Just mix it in and go‚Äîno taste, no mess.

# How to Build Your Own Coffee Bar at Home

Another major trend is the rise of **coffee bar ideas for home**. With more people working remotely and spending time at home, having a designated coffee area has become a lifestyle upgrade worth investing in.

Pinterest shows that **coffee bar ideas for home** have jumped from an average search score of **83 to 100** in just three months. That‚Äôs a big leap‚Äîand it makes sense.

**Here‚Äôs how to build your own:**

1. **Choose a spot**: A small counter, shelf, or corner will work.
2. **Stock essentials**: Coffee maker, grinder, mugs, creamer, syrups, and maybe a shaker for iced coffee.
3. **Add flair**: Personal touches like cute labels, a chalkboard menu, or LED lighting can elevate the experience.
4. **Go pro**: Add a metabolism booster to your setup‚Äîit blends seamlessly into any routine.

Trust me, once you start treating your morning coffee like a mini caf√© experience, you‚Äôll never go back.

>üßã **Try This Yourself:**  
Set up your own coffee bar today using Pinterest-inspired decor and a powerful metabolism hack as your secret ingredient. Not only will it look great, but it‚Äôll help you stay on track with your health goals too.

# Homemade Coffee Syrup & Flavor Hacks You Need to Know

Let‚Äôs talk about flavor. One of the top rising trends is **homemade coffee syrup**, which has a current Pinterest search score of **100** and is growing fast. Why? Because people are tired of artificial sweeteners and sugary creamers.

Making your own syrup is easy:

* Boil equal parts sugar and water.
* Add vanilla, cinnamon, or cocoa for flavor.
* Store in a bottle and refrigerate.

This lets you customize your coffee without the guilt. And here‚Äôs a bonus‚Äîyou can pair it with a metabolism-boosting hack for a double win: great taste + metabolic support.

>‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:** Always read labels and choose clean, natural ingredients. Look for products made with plant-based compounds and no fillers or artificial additives.

# Final Thoughts: Make Coffee Work For You

Coffee isn‚Äôt just a drink anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle. From global village coffeehouse vibes to plastic coffee cans and Dutch Bros drinks copycats, people are finding new ways to enjoy their daily brew.

The best part? You don‚Äôt need to spend $5 every morning at Starbucks anymore. You can make your own delicious, energizing coffee right at home‚Äîand even add a metabolism-boosting supplement to the mix.

>‚úÖ **Ready to Upgrade Your Coffee Game?**  
Start today with a simple change: Mix a powerful metabolism hack into your favorite iced coffee or cold brew. Taste-free, easy to use, and packed with metabolism-supporting ingredients‚Äîit‚Äôs the perfect sidekick to your new coffee ritual.

So, I'm about to go on this trip, and it's like my neurological synapses are engaged in a poorly documented experimental blend of anticipation and excitement, intertwining in a state of superposition.

Phase One involves the neurotransmitter release ‚Äì dopamine chiefly, acting like excited particles zipping around in a super-collider, accelerating at velocities that make my brain's reward circuit light up like a Christmas tree. This produces the initial external symptoms like inexplicable jitters and, I kid you not, a perpetual grin stretching the muscles in my face in a manner akin to facial yoga.

In Phase Two, my inner narrative anticipates the event itself with a degree of speculative precision that would make any cat-in-a-box have an existential crisis ‚Äì every permutation of potential outcomes plays out in vivid simulations inside my cerebral cortex. It's kinda like an adventure-ready timeline branching out in a thousand directions, each one theoretically plausible, yet empirically undetermined until observed through the lens of real-world engagement.

Finally, in Phase Three, this emotion undergoes what I would pseudo-scientifically classify as ""Event Horizon Convergence."" As the anticipated moment approaches, all possible future states collapse into a singular node of reality where the actual experience unfolds. This quantum reduction produces an oddly satisfying confluence of mood where theoretical probabilistic outcomes coalesce into one realized truth.

In conclusion, anticipatory excitement might not necessitate goggles and a lab coat, but the mental gymnastics it demands leave me feeling part physicist, part wide-eyed adventurer. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll continue documenting these phenomena, armed with my trusty mug of coffee and a stubborn curiosity. Wondering what everyone else's quantum excitement looks like, or is it just my weekend science experiment? üòÑüé¢",1,1749731612.0,feelingsUnderMicrosco,0,1.0,False

Not here to waste time, looking for something that‚Äôs equal parts fun, chill, and real (and yes, maybe a bit sugar-daddy-coded, but let‚Äôs not get stuck on labels).

About me? Built a decent life with startups, tech stuff, and some real estate hustle. That means I do okay in life ‚Äî have a pad in Indiranagar (yes, the one with the view and occasional monkey visits üêí), a Merc for weekend escapes to Coorg, and I don‚Äôt mind cracking open a nice bottle of red when the mood hits. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1 (yes, tall guys exist, don‚Äôt report me), hit Cubbon Park for runs, and occasionally burn toast while pretending I‚Äôm Gordon Ramsay.

What I actually enjoy? Real convos. Sarcastic banter over filter coffee at Koshy‚Äôs. Random late-night drives to Nandi Hills. Planning a world trip and canceling it for the 3rd time. Stargazing while pretending we know the constellations. Food that doesn‚Äôt come in a Zomato box (tho no shade, I love you, Truffles üçî).

Looking for:
Someone smart, beautiful and confident, ideally 18-30 (don‚Äôt kill me for the age filter ‚Äî just vibes and energy match, ya?). Maybe you‚Äôre a student, maybe you work, maybe you‚Äôre building your dream startup in Koramangala. Doesn‚Äôt matter. Just be you. Bonus if you laugh at terrible jokes and are okay with cheesy jazz nights or sudden travel plans.

I‚Äôm offering a fun, respectful arrangement. That means the good stuff ‚Äî yes, shopping, fancy dinners, UB City days, and helping with your dreams (tuition, side hustle, whatever). But also ‚Äî genuine convos, laughter, and a break from the usual boring-ass routine.

I value honesty, respect boundaries, and won‚Äôt ghost like a 20-something on Bumble üôÉ

Hi! üëã I've had this Monstera for a while now and I adore it! It's grown really fast, and I've let it spread out on my kitchen wall. Every morning when I drink my coffee, I just sit and admire it.
The problem is that for some time now, about three weeks, some of the leaves have started to turn yellow and dry out. I did a little research and found that this happens when it's overwatered, so I started watering it less frequently, about once a week or every week and a half. However, the problem hasn't gone away; the leaves are still drying.
I've included a photo at the end showing the general humidity I maintain where the Monstera is located. The pot is large; I repotted it half a year ago, but I haven't used any fertilizer. The plant is in my kitchen, facing east, getting enough light, but not direct sunlight. I'm not sure what the exact causes might be, so if you have any ideas, I really need your help, plant lovers!

Does anyone know if the teapot actually exists? Or is there a link for information about this collection anywhere with all items listed?

Hi! I've had this Monstera (first and only monstera  I own) for a while now and I adore it! It's grown really fast, and I've let it spread out on my kitchen wall. Every morning when I drink my coffee, I just sit and admire it.
The problem is that for some time now, about three weeks, some of the leaves have started to turn yellow and dry out. I did a little research and found that this happens when it's overwatered, so I started watering it less frequently, about once a week or every week and a half. However, the problem hasn't gone away; the leaves are still drying.
I've included a photo at the end showing the general humidity I maintain where the Monstera is located. The pot is large; I repotted it half a year ago, but I haven't used any fertilizer. I'm not sure what the exact causes might be, so if you have any ideas, I really need your help, plant lovers! I don't want to risk losing it.
