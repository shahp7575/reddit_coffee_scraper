1llxwyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1llxwyj/my_brain_fog_story/,My brain fog story,"Hello all together,

I want to describe the struggles that I had in the last few years (mainly), and how I managed to handle them. Sorry for possible language errors as English is not my mother tongue.

As I can remember my problems started around 2020. I sometimes got dizzy and had focus issues but it always disappeared. At that time I was a student in my master of electrical engineering. Over time the problems got worse, meaning that I had more often brain fog and headache, especially when studying long time, or when I was working on a project. I tried to ignore that, and at first this kind of worked, even though motivating myself was much more difficult. ¬†I also noticed, when I worked with collegues I needed more breaks than them and was sooner tired. I had the feeling that my head is smoking. When I talked with my family about that everybody just said it is normal and that I am just imagining this, or they blamed stress or even laziness. I decided to just keep on fighting through my studies even it felt kind of unhealthy.

In May 2021 I had covid. I recovered well from it, but I still suffered from post covid symptoms like fatigue, brain fog. I remember, when I went for a run, I was tired for two days afterwards.¬†After a few weeks/month my body started to recover and I could do sports again. But the brain fog was still there, especially, when I studied the brain fog worsened. I had difficulties to focus but I managed to get through all the exams.

In September 2021 I started with my master thesis, meaning that I had work several hours at the computer every day. I remember working was really hard. My brain fog was always there as well as headache and fatigue. When I worked for an hour I felt so tired that I could take a nap afterwards. I just tried to fight myself through, trinking a lot of coffees and shifting my working time in the night, because this somehow felt better. I tried to ignore the brain fog, meditated everyday, and went for walks. It kind of gave me some relief but still I was suffering from the symptoms and I felt quite unproductive, because I couldn‚Äôt focus well.

At that time Germany was in a bad condition, due to lockdowns and the split society which also affected me mentally. I asked myself, if my symptoms are maybe due to this and if it will all go a way, when the situation improves. I got into a kind of indifferent state and told myself: I'll just push through, no matter what happens‚Äîeven if it takes a toll on my health.. Somehow I managed to finish my thesis. I would say it was not really good, but whatever. I was just happy to be done. This was in April 2022.

After my master thesis I could not sit on the computer for 15 minutes without getting really tired, brain fog and headdache. During conversations my mind wandered and I difficulties to focus. Also I had difficulties to look in the eyes of people, for example during dates.I had also problems in big crowds and on public places. I was just overwhelmed really easily and also suffered from anxiety. The funny part was, when I drank alcohol, the symptoms were reduced but I got drunk really easily. So in the time after my master thesis, I drank a lot, which was kind of understandable because I wanted to celebrate it.

Besides having these to hand out to folks I want to try and re-connect with, or who are interested in coming and dancing with us, I also tape one to my phone and water bottle, use laminated luggage tags on my bike, backpack, camp chair, etc. Last year I got a favorite coffee travel mug back from leaving it at the temple. It also has my default info: name, phone, email ""in case.""

For context, I'm 27 now but was 19 at the time so I'll refer to myself as the age it all happened. Now on to this shit show I still cannot believe I lived, I honestly couldn't have made this up!!

I (F19) I shall call myself Maisie, met the most handsome, charming and sweetest guy ever (M22 - not) at the ripe age of 19 and honestly couldn't believe my luck when I met this guy, we shall call him Luke... for now. 

Luke measures everything you would want in a partner, he listened, was super sweet, showered me with compliments and was honestly a very sweet guy... for 5 weeks before his mask started to slip. 
Things were still very early on, and I really liked him but wanted to take things slow to make sure we really worked before fully committing to him. Well, by week 5, his perfect mask started to crack. It started slowly, he started to get a little frustrated if I didn't reply quick enough (for context I was a full time college student) and would fly off the handle at small things and then apologise as if it wasn't a big deal.

Things started to get scary when one day I was walking to my class at college, abd who do I see approaching? You guessed it, Luke! Mind you, I NEVER TOLD HIM WHAT COLLEGE I WENT TO!! Dude went all investigator mode and figured out where I studied and then called me crazy for being freaked out at his random pop up act. When I told him to leave, he decided to have a go at me for what I was wearing (jeans and a jumper in the middle of summer because my confidence was non existent) claiming and I quote ""you have a man now, why you trying so hard, you look desperate!"". Well, that pissed me off! If you know me, my confidence may have been nowhere to be found, but my pettiness always existed and I wasn't going to let a man tell me what I can wear so I kindly told him to leave and go F himself and went on my way. The next day,I made sure to send him a selfie of me wearing a super pretty short sleeve midi dress to class as a simple FU and told him never to tell me what to wear again. 

He apologised and I thought I could look past it that once... oh what a silly girl I was ü§£ 

It was good for 2 days. He showed up again, this time starting a full argument about the way I looked because I had makeup on and was ""such a try hard slut trying to impress boys"" because apparently us women live to dress and wear makeup for male attention, and not because we want to feel good or look good for ourselves and nobody else .. that was news to me! When I told him to go this time, he grabbed my arm so tight I had a handprint bruise for a week and on top of that, I use crutches when I walk due to some health issues I have going on and he snatched them off of me and chucked them out of reach so I wouldn't walk away whilst he was talking to me. I eventually talked him down, he apologised, I went to class abd he left but I was petrified of him at that point. 

We had an argument later that night where I told him from over the phone that what he did was completely unacceptable, that he hurt me and he scared me a lot and I honestly didn't want that toxicity in my life. He went off the deep end, said he would hurt me, hurt myself, hurt my mum as he somehow found out where I live and threatened to ruin my life to which I laughed and said, you've got a good head start on that one which he didn't appreciate.

After that, he apologised like crazy, send me everything that was sunshine and rainbows, you know, the classic love bomb techniques trying to reel me back in but I was done.

It had only been 6 weeks of us dating by this point and honestly, he scared me. He threatened to hurt me if I told anyone and honestly, I knew he would make good on his threats so I stupidly kept it to myself and was trying to find a nice way to end things because i was too kind for my own good and despite all he had done to me, I didn't want to be mean or be the bad guy in the situation.

Thankfully, my out came to me. Grab your popcorn people because this is there its gets extra juicy!!!!

Three days after the big argument, (I was talking to him like normal trying to buy myself some time) I was trying to figure out how to end things with this crazy dude and ping, I get a message üòÖ this message was from an unknown woman asking if I knew 'Luke', to which I said yes whilst simultaneously having a category 12 panic attack! This lady asked if I was dating him, to which I said 'not for much longer' and she then said she was Lukes FIANCEE!! HIS FREAKING FIANCEE!!! She asked if I was willing to facetime her to talk as she suspected he was cheating on her for months but nobody was willing to talk and that she wanted to confirm things for both of us as the only one to be mad at was Luke and not the girl (me) who had no idea he was a lying, cheating piece of poop, to which I happily obliged.

As we talked, I found out some crazy shit! 1. His name wasn't Luke! His middle name was Luke, he real name was ""mark"", 2. Luke wasn't 22, he was 26 with a very young face, 3. He was cheating on an absolute amazing woman he had in his fiancee, and the big one, HE HAD A 6 WEEK OLD BABY BOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A WHOLE DAMN CHILD!!! A WHOLE ASS HUMAN BABY!!! (A cute, chunky, adorable little boy) and whilst she was in labour, he was talking to me the whole time.

As 2 smart women, we decided to set a trap üòè she, I'll call her Lilly, decided to play the part of the overprotective best friend, I was the nieve non the wiser 'girlfriend' and we started the group chat. In said group chat, lilly was asking all the questions she needed to know such as how we met, was he single ü§£, his age, blah blah lies lies, blah blah shut up.

After he confirmed all of his lies, we dropped the bomb in the form of a screenshot of me, Lilly, and baby boy of facetime all smiles and middle fingers to the air. Yeeaaaahhhhh he blew up. And I mean, full on scary shit.

He started by threatening to kill both of us, said we would regret everything, said they should have terminated the pregnancy for baby boy when they had the chance because he ""didn't want the little shit to begin with"". The lowest things you could ever say to someone. For safety reasons, I convinced Lilly to not go home that night and thankfully she listened, packed a quick bag and stayed at her mums for the night. We kept checking in with each other as he went completely silent on both of us, and to be honest, the silence was scarier than the violence and the horrific messages. Silence means bad things and boy was shit bad!!

The next day, Lilly called Lukes (mark) work to make sure he went in and then went with her mum to their flat to pack up and move out whilst he wasn't home but unfortunately, that wasn't possible. Lilly facetimed me in tears (by this point, me and her formed a friendship out of the craziness because we shared a horrific experience, honestly my explanation of what I was put through was the best and less traumatic version of what he did, and from what Lilly said (she gave me permission to share) he used his hands and feet on her almost daily and this situation was the opportunity to get out of that mess to save herself and ensure her sons safety too). 

When she walked in to the flat, it was unrecognisable! Within the 15 hours of us blowing up the situation and her returning home, Luke had destroyed everything in sight and didn't leave anything untouched. All the plates, mugs and dishes had been smashed all over the floor, a bat had been taken to the TV, all the electronics her broken to pieces, pictures torn apart, canvases of their babies newborn photos had been slashed with a knife, all of the babies items had been cut up and bleached, the mattresses were burned and he had slashed the sofa to pieces leaving a knife in it and the cherry on the cake, he left paperwork on the coffee table signing his rights away to baby boy and secured it to the table with another knife stabbed into the wood. He had the paperwork BEFORE the shit hit the fan to abandon him. 

Naturally, Lilly called the police and had it all documented and we cried on the phone together because I felt so bad that I caused this to happen to her and the baby and that they were left with nothing. He even drained their joint bank account and the babies savings account which already had a good few thousand pounds in it so she had nothing left to start again.

When the police went to his work to arrest him, he took off and was able to escape with the clothes on his back and a duffle bag he packed in the middle of destruction.

Over the next 2 months, we both got threatening messages from random numbers but was obviously him, he kept driving by my college which was scary but I informed security so I was protected before ye disappeared off the face if the earth after he showed up to try and hurt Lilly again but was chased off by the police again and hasn't been seen or heard from again. He put me off of dating for a long long time, I've only just got back in to the dating game in the last 2 years and always trust my gut instinct but haven't met my match as of yet. As for Lilly, her best friend from childhood moved back home 2 months before her world imploded but wasn't able to reach out as he was worried he would cause Luke to hurt her, but when everything went down he was the first one to run and be at her side and their friendship picked up right where it left off 4 years prior when Luke intruded and became a parasite she couldn't shake off. He I'll call him Ben, was Lillys rock, did everything for baby boy and helped build lilly up instead of knock her down and over the following year, they realised they were each others person and made things official!! Aaaahhh I was so happy for them!! They got married just before baby boys 3rd birthday and on his 4th birthday, Ben officially became baby boys daddy on paper, and he was adopted by the only man he has known as daddy and they couldn't be happier. The following year they welcomed a baby girl and have honestly made the most perfect family and I couldn't be happier. 

Lilly and I's friendship has fizzled out but we still check in from time to time but honestly, I will always be here for her and vise versa, we are just happily living our lives separately and without Luke in it. I will never not smile when I get a random picture from her with a message stating something like ""If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have found happiness. Thank you for being the strength I needed at the hardest time in life for the both of us. Forever your friend"" and it makes me cry every time.",1,1751040583.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1llxss5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1llxss5/how_do_i_know_if_its_bloating_or_constipation_or/,How do I know if it‚Äôs bloating or constipation or weight gain or a real bump?,"Hi, I'm 16w and 2d pregnant and this is my first time of everything. Any advice appreciated!!! 

In my first trimester I had sooo much bloating and constipation that it could look like I had a bump one day by evening and then it would be gone the next. One week ago I was feeling great- second trimester energy back, had managed constipation, felt no symptoms, looked a little maybe wider but not obviously pregnant - and over the weekend we traveled to a long (several day) wedding. I get constipation normally when traveling and I think the pregnancy exacerbates this, and got it again. I was in many wedding events so didn't feel comfortable using anything stronger than miralax, lots of water, and colace and even that was not really effective. By the third night I looked much more pregnant... (like people could tell) and felt physically bad. 

I kept telling my husband it was the constipation but since coming back home it hasn't really gone down? I'm  having more regular BMs but but very liquid only, because that seems to be the only way (prune juice, miralax and mirafast, colace, magnesium citrate, fiber rich foods, kimchi, stretching and yoga ball, tons of water and liquid iv, coffee, etc) and the worst part is I still feel uncomfortable because of how *full* my stomach area is (not like full after eating feeling, I'm still hungry). Am I still constipated (am worried about incomplete bms) or is this a bump?? How can I even tell??

I‚Äôm looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. üòÇ However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I‚Äôd love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it‚Äôs my daily dose of cardio. I‚Äôm big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you‚Äôre into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up üí™

I‚Äôve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD üòå

I‚Äôm a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I‚Äôm hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite 

I‚Äôm a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ‚ò∫Ô∏èI don‚Äôt bite (but one of my cats might). üò∫ ",1,1751040545.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

A few different companies but in the same industry. As a sales person I need to coordinate with the administrative people for orders and many other things.  Every company I've worked at I have a really difficult time working with the female administrative people. Any time I ask them to help with something or to do something for me, they hate me for it. Instead of just helping me they ask why do I need this, do I need this now or can it wait, or can someone else do it because they are busy with other more important things than me. Even if I have a million dollar order that needs to be coordinated, or a huge new client, and they are busy ordering coffee pods for the office.  They are annoyed by everything I ask for, and act like I have no right to ask them for anything and am just making their job and their life more difficult. I've never had this problem with any male I've worked with. All the men I've worked with we have a great deal of mutual respect, when I ask them for something they understand the importance of it and take it very seriously. They never question or doubt me, just yes I will get on that for you.  But with women this has plagued me my entire career, and I have no idea how to fix it or what it is about me that makes women give me no professional respect. I feel like if I try to be tougher and more demanding with them that will just annoy them more, and if I'm softer with them they will ignore everything I ask them for.

Sadly I don't think I have any more free time (Just finished Hollow Forest) so I'm pretty sure I can't get any skill cards from coffee to more easily optimize certain aspects of these guys and will have to wait for NG+ to do that.

Changes I would LIKE to do if possible in NG+ would be...

Yoshitsune-Arms Master in place of Ziodyne, Heat Riser will replace Auto-Suku, Hassou Tobi will replace Brave Blade.

Surt-Spell Master in place of Mind Charge

Loki-Ditto

Thor-Absorb Wind (I do have Resist Wind as a card tho) in place of Deathbound, Spell Master in place of Arms Master, not sure what I'd replace Power Charge with

Odin-Spell master in place of Regen 3

Anubis-Null Dark in place of Dekaja, multi-target version of Mudoon in place of Dekunda

Ishtar-Null Dark in place of Resist Dark, Null Light in place of Dekaja

[LithiumAI.io](http://lithiumai.io/) is an end-to-end platform designed for communication professionals to work smarter and focus on strategic, higher-level tasks, rather than sifting through media databases for journalists' contacts, having to ""time the market"", crafting drop-off-the-hat media pitches based on feel that it may get picked up by journalists more than executive judgment.

Why Lithium? Only 24% of journalists today respond to pitches. Securing earned media in national and top-tier news outlets has become more challenging than before. Even pitching to trade media in today‚Äôs environment requires more effort than before, according to a 2023 PRGN Survey.

Cool or not cool? 

Folks, before you start sending me hate mail, consider that I'm helping you elevate your game so you don't have to do as much writing and can start engaging your stakeholders, including the media, more effectively, rather than just being a content producer.

1llxq32,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1llxq32/is_it_time_to_break_up/,is it time to break up?,"hi all just having a lot of confusing feelings and not sure where to turn. i‚Äôve asked my friends and they all give me conflicting opinions as well. me (23f) and my bf (25m) have been together for a little over 7 months. the first 2-2 1/2 months were really great i thought wow i have never actually known what love is because this is it. i was so so sure of it this time. he told me all the time how he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and how wonderful i was. we met thru mutual friends in real life which was another added bonus because dating apps were really wearing me down. we spent time together pretty much every day and i never got tired of him (which is a huge feat for me). we decided we would move in together when his lease was up in mid july, but around mid february my roommate unexpectedly moved out early and so he pretty much started living with me since then. i think that‚Äôs when everything started to go wrong. since then it feels that we argue at least every two or three days. at this point it feels more like every other day. it‚Äôs always over little things too but he talks me in circles and gets me so worked up i feel so tired and confused i just give up. he says that i don‚Äôt make it a point to spend time with him even tho if im not at work i am in fact with him. i barely see any friends anymore and i tell him that often but he says that isn‚Äôt the point. he told me the other day that i am miserable and never want to do anything but sit on the couch at home. this is not terribly far from true as i have been feeling extremely depressed since about march and i can‚Äôt help but think it has something to do with my unhappiness in our relationship. he doesn‚Äôt clean up after himself and leave open drink bottles on the floor and coffee table, leaves hair in the sink, dirty clothes everywhere. i am not perfectly tidy but i know i do better than him. he leaves perishable items from the fridge out overnight and when i have expressed my frustration with that he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine you can still use it‚Äù. absolutely not. he blames this on adhd which i suppose i can understand but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less frustrating to deal with. he makes me feel like he is not in love with me anymore and it breaks my heart. he will say nice things to me, but i can tell he doesn‚Äôt truly mean it anymore. i told him last night i was afraid of losing him and he just dismissed it. i would hope he would hug me and tell me of course you won‚Äôt lose me i love you so much or just anything to show me he cares, but i don‚Äôt get that. he tells me that‚Äôs just how he is, especially when i tell him i feel that‚Äôs he‚Äôs being short with me or talking to me mean. he says well that‚Äôs just my voice‚Ä¶ but it didn‚Äôt used to be like that :/ he is insecure as well and got upset with me for going to a music show at a cafe to reconnect with a friend i hadn‚Äôt seen in over 4 years because i didn‚Äôt invite him to come with me. it feels like he wants me around him all the time but he isn‚Äôt even happy when im there. he follows me around the house and wants me to do the same. it‚Äôs just exhausting. as i‚Äôm typing this out i realize i sound ridiculous. now here‚Äôs the real kicker. i just found out he was still talking to his ex gf (although they had split) when we‚Äôre were beginning to see each other. he told her he was staying at a friends house when actually he was staying with me. i just really do love him and i miss the way things where in the beginning. he will still do nice things for me like cook dinner every night or change the oil on my car or sit and watch a movie with me. we have a garden together that we tend to. we just don‚Äôt seem to be able to communicate effectively and i feel like a crazy person. he‚Äôs made me feel like im a terrible partner. does anyone think this is worth saving? lol ",2,1751040388.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It's a 3-d locked perspective fluid game where you had to tilt your device to move the fluid. I remember a coffee level and a space level, as well as (for some reason) a level where there's a head chasing the liquid. I'll try to explain the liquid type too. Every level is a different liquid. Like for example, water, coffee, lava, ferrofluid, and so on. It has a strange vibe, and I remember there was some level with a timer and a spinning room or something. Now, idk if I said this but the concept of the game is to tilt your device to move water (kind of like a cup irl) and try to get to the end without losing any.

Facing pressure from EU regulators, including a ‚Ç¨500 million fine for non-compliance and threats of further penalties, Apple announced a series of updates to its developer policies. This move came just before the June 26 deadline, highlighting the urgency and importance of adhering to the new regulations.

The changes focus on two key areas: how app developers can communicate with their customers and the fees Apple charges. Under the new ‚Äúanti-steering‚Äù rules, EU app developers will now be able to link to alternative payment options for subscriptions and in-app purchases outside the App Store, across any channel. This shift significantly impacts Apple‚Äôs control over transactions within its ecosystem.

Simultaneously, Apple is implementing new fee structures for developers operating within the EU App Store. These fees, designed to meet the DMA's requirements, include an ""initial acquisition fee,"" a ""store services fee,"" and a Core Technology Fee for apps exceeding one million annual installs. While Apple has the right to appeal the decision until July 7, these changes reflect the ongoing impact of the DMA on major tech players and the company‚Äôs willingness to adapt to regulatory pressure.

**Deals and Bargains: Smart Gadgets and Software**

Consumers are always on the lookout for a good deal, and the news on June 27th offered a variety of compelling options. The Verge Deals section is highlighting several enticing offers, with the promise of commission for those who click through their links.

The article highlights the premium nature of Apple products and the appeal of refurbished options as a more budget-friendly alternative.

The Steam Summer Sale is also in full swing, promising significant discounts across a vast selection of games. The sale, running through July 11, features deals on recent releases. Notable discounts include 15% off the puzzle game *Blue Prince* and 10% off *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*.

**Tech Reviews and Gadget Comparisons**

For consumers navigating the complex world of tech, review sites provide essential guidance. *The Verge Reviews* emphasizes its role in helping consumers choose their next phone, laptop, or other tech gear. They provide product reviews, buying advice, and recommendations based on their own testing. The site is actively reviewing new products from leading manufacturers like Apple, Samsung, and Google.

The reviews themselves are provided with Verge Scores, with a wide array of tech receiving scores from 7 to 8. One review highlights the observation of My Picun F8 Pros not being as good as the AirPods Max.

Beyond specific deals and reviews, the news also highlights a new contender in the smart glasses market: Xiaomi. Their AI Glasses have been introduced, aiming to compete with the Meta Ray-Ban glasses. The key selling point highlighted in the report is the glasses' potential to facilitate mobile payments using a combination of the camera and Alipay.

**Other Consumer Affairs Developments**

The government is planning to introduce barcodes to combat the fake drug menace. This is a significant public safety measure, indicating a proactive approach to address an important consumer issue. This update was available on The Economic Times website.

1llxmho,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingVPN/comments/1llxmho/should_you_really_use_a_vpn_for_online_banking_in/,Should You Really Use a VPN for Online Banking in 2025?,"Online banking is basically part of daily life now. But the more we rely on it, the more questions come up about how secure it really is, especially with the way online threats keep evolving.

Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking: Does using a VPN make a big difference for banking in 2025?

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve figured out so far.


Is Online Banking Already Safe Enough?
Most banks do a decent job with things like encryption, two factor authentication, and fraud alerts. Still, banking apps aren‚Äôt bulletproof, especially when you're using networks you don't fully control.

Public Wi Fi, in particular, is a weak spot. And even home networks can have vulnerabilities if your router is outdated or not set up securely.

So while banks have security, the connection you‚Äôre using still matters.


What Does a VPN Actually Do for Banking?
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) adds a layer of privacy by encrypting your internet traffic. That means your activity is hidden from your internet service provider, potential hackers, and any third parties trying to track your behavior.

If you‚Äôre checking your account at a coffee shop or logging in while traveling, it basically makes it harder for anyone nearby to grab your data.

Are All VPNs Good for This?
Not really. Some VPNs slow your connection, and others aren‚Äôt compatible with banking apps. A few even get flagged or blocked, which kind of defeats the purpose.

You‚Äôd need one that doesn‚Äôt interrupt your connection, keeps speed consistent, and isn‚Äôt known for logging user data.


What About VeePN?
It‚Äôs one I‚Äôve seen mentioned in different conversations. Seems to have the basics covered, encryption, support for multiple devices, a decent number of servers. Not flashy, but not sketchy either.

I haven‚Äôt used it for banking myself, but I‚Äôve seen others say it works without issues. Still wondering if it‚Äôs something more people are starting to rely on.


Do You Even Need a VPN at Home?
Some people think it‚Äôs unnecessary on a private network, but there‚Äôs another side to that. ISPs can still track your activity, and some home setups aren‚Äôt fully secure, especially if there are lots of devices connected.

So using a VPN at home isn‚Äôt overkill for everyone. It really depends on how much control and privacy you want.


Just Trying to Figure Out What‚Äôs Worth It
So here‚Äôs the big question:
Is a VPN something you use all the time for online banking, only when you‚Äôre traveling, or not at all?

If you are using one, what‚Äôs been working well for you?

I‚Äôm just trying to find that balance between convenience and real peace of mind, without overcomplicating things.

1llxmfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ramanobourbon/comments/1llxmfc/last_week_i_had_a_hangnail_this_week_i_will_die/,"Last week I had a hangnail, this week I will die Pt 2","It was 7 AM. I should have been clocking in.

Instead I was ripping my own skin with duct tape. The loose piece of tape hanging off my arm held a flesh rope 2 feet long, expanding in size. It was still attached to me. It looked like gum. 

What do I do?

It burns. I can‚Äôt put ice on it.

It stings. I can‚Äôt pop pain pills. 

I‚Äôm dirt broke. I can‚Äôt afford a hospital bill. 

Is cutting it myself really my only option?

I looked around my kitchenette for a knife, scissors, anything sharp to cut the 2 inch fastening to the rest of my arm. Knives were dirty in the sink, covered in unrecognizable goop from any of my dinners from the past two weeks. No way in hell I‚Äôd use those. 

‚ÄúScissors‚Ä¶ scissors‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered. Mylee still laid in the hallway, out of breath from my defensive hit. I was sorry, but she‚Äôll be fine. 

My sister would often bring her Cricut over to my house and do arts and crafts when she was bored. They were small little crimps used to peel off stickers but they might do. I trudged over to the front of the TV, not noticing the remote lying on the floor in front of me. I stepped on it, I slid, I fell and bashed my forehead on the coffee table. The wood splintered and fell through, leaving my head lying on a prickly pillow filled with wooden shards, one sinking itself into my ear and another into my tear duct. My vision blurred in my left eye, but my ears still worked fine. 

The TV whispered the news to me. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ record breaking heat wave soon sweeping the entire state. Temperatures will be in the 110s, in some cities even up to the 120s. Stay hydrated at all times, crank your air conditioners to the max, and stay out of the sun. This weather is not for tanning or sunbathing.‚Äù

Great. In the fall I tore off the piece of skin that was still attached to me, leaving the tape, puppy pads and stingray of skin lying perpendicular to the coffee table. I fixed my problem, but now I couldn‚Äôt see. I could still use the scissors, I thought. 

Using my good hand, I propped myself up off the floor and scooted myself towards the entertainment center, opened the Cricut box and swiping the lavender scissors that lay in it. I only had one shot at doing this before I fuck anything else up. 

I put the edges of the blades on the splinter in my eye. It was about 5 millimeters wide and 2 inches long, so every jittery movement from my shaky hands sent pain to all sides of my head. I inhaled, exhaled, inhaled, exhaled and prepared to pull. 

Mylee woke up. She was very excited to see me. 

She barreled into the living room and charged at me like a linebacker, forcing her head into my chest with a thump. The splinter I was holding slid further inside my eye, penetrating my canaliculi. 

‚ÄúWHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU??‚Äù I loved this dog but she‚Äôs making it harder and harder to do so. She licked my arm ferociously to appease me, slimy strings of spit stinging my pink flesh. Jacob‚Äôs Salivating Ladder. I pushed her back with my foot and attempted to stand up, falling back down on my ass onto the slivered board again. I had a concussion from the fall, another issue in my Rolodex of problems.

I was now partially blinded, only able to see through my left eye with a squint. The spit mixed with the blood on my forearm and coagulated into a deep red paint, like if someone got a bloody and runny nose at the same time. 

I still had the scissors in my hand, which I used to carefully pry the splinter in my ear. It wasn‚Äôt in deep but pushed a ball of wax further into my canal which blocked my eardrum. Combined with the concussion, I could now barely balance myself. Lazily, I re-taped the puppy pads around my arm. I was careful not to miss this time. My biggest issue now was going to be the weather. How will my arm react when unfathomable heat is involved?

I crawled and dragged myself over to the spot underneath my thermostat. 72 degrees is what it was set at; it would need to be lower. I gripped the corner of my wall and inched my way up, lifting my good hand up as I did. I couldn‚Äôt read any of the words on the panel, or the degrees on the screen. My brain was still trying to wake up and crashing down twice with a sliver in my eye was not helping it whatsoever. 

Muscle memory was sure to be on my side right?

The buttons were square, not arrows like in most households. There were five buttons, one of them had to be the right one. 

I clicked and held. 

My phone buzzed on the counter. I dropped back down and crawled over to it, shakily accepting the call. 

It was my friend Korbin. 

‚ÄúHey man, I haven‚Äôt heard from you in a couple days, you all good?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

How do I tell him? Where do I start?

‚ÄúMy skin is falling off. There‚Äôs a splinter in my eye. I have a concussion.‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúAre you tweaking right now, dude? Did your landlord put lead in your pipes? What do you mean your skin is falling off?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy skin is peeled all the way back to my elbow. It‚Äôs bleeding and slimy. I‚Äôd appreciate it if you shut the fuck up.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, I was just joking. Do you want me to come take you to a hospital?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford that,‚Äù I lamented. 

‚ÄúYou need to put something on it. Neosporin or something,‚Äù Korbin said. I‚Äôd need 50 tubes of it for even one coat. 

‚ÄúDo you have any alcohol?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, why?‚Äù

‚ÄúI need some to pour on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd waste my $160 scotch? You‚Äôre talking out of your ass right now!‚Äù God, he‚Äôs braindead. 

‚ÄúIsopropyl, dumbass. Rubbing alcohol?‚Äù

‚ÄúOhhh, right, yeah. I might, let me look around here for a second.‚Äù About two minutes of silence.

He grabbed his phone again. ‚ÄúI got some! It‚Äôs about three quarters of a bottle, could we make that do the trick?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that might help.‚Äù I knew it wouldn‚Äôt cover the whole arm, but I needed something. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in about an hour? The brakes are going out on the old Altima so I gotta take the main roads slow.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah. See you then.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSee you.‚Äù

My landlord. My landlord. Fuck, rent was due three weeks ago. He came the week prior to tell me this is the last time he‚Äôs letting me pass. I was sure to get an eviction notice on my front door soon. 

My skin started to sweat underneath the pads, stinging when a pore leaked. All I had to do was wait. 

I crawled over to the broken wood on the floor and set it on the coffee table. All I had to do was wait. 

I stared at the clock. All I had to do was wait. 

My muscle fibers burned with every pull on the floor. All I had to do was wait. 

Maybe I‚Äôll take a nap, I thought. There‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôll be able to pull myself onto my bed. I could try the couch. Gripping the leather with my good hand I hoisted myself to my shaking feet and fell down onto the sofa. The pain was searing but maybe I could ignore it. I drifted off, hoping my mind would go blank. 

I awoke a half hour later to the news once again. 

‚ÄúThe driver of the truck stated he lost control of his wheel and drifted into the other lane. The car attempted to swerve but angled his right fender directly in the way of the semi. The driver of the silver Nissan Altima was killed on impact.‚Äù

1llxlro,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1llxlro/should_i_worry_about_my_pvcs/,Should I worry about my PVCs?,"I've been having PVCs a little more often now. I don't know how many a day exactly because I don't have a monitor, so I'm talking about the ones I feel. Some of them feel light, but some of them feel really deep and significant and are a tiny bit painful. Usually it's just  a couple per day that I can feel. But every so often, I'll get a wave of PVCs back to back that last for 10 to 30 minutes, then they suddenly stop especially when I do deep breathing. I also have ulcerative colitis and I notice that when my gut is normal again, I'll get more PVCs but I won't have any when I'm flared up, it's very strange. Right now my gut is back to normal and the PVCs are back. I also got my heart thoroughly checked back in 2022 for the same reasons and they said my heart was normal and healthy except for a little defect that I've had since birth which they considered benign. I'm still very active, I skateboard and cycle a lot. My dad is a doctor and he tells me not to worry about it and that it triggers more PVCs when I worry which I have found to be true. I drink coffee only once in the morning, so I don't think it's the caffein. I feel like a lot of my PVCs are triggered by my digestive track because I have noticed that food can sometimes trigger PVCs and every time I get a couple PVCs, I feel a slight urge to use the bathroom. Just curious on your thoughts, if maybe I should see a doctor again or not worry. So far today, I've only felt 1 happen. But my PVCs feel deep and scary and I feel a missing beat when I check my pulse as they happen. ",2,1751040103.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

Maybe some 25-40 yo Italian expats in New York are here... especially who recently moved and don‚Äôt have a lot of friends in New York.

I started study Italian recently and would be nice to practice in person (I supply coffee or even negroni haha).

1llxkdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonduality/comments/1llxkdr/headaches/,Headaches.,"Brought this up before, here and other subs, and nobody has an answer nor solution. A lot of guessing though, which is cool.

What's fascinating is that a remedy will work one day and then stop working the next. Like this morning versus yesterday.

Yesterday, ""Who am I,"" and reverting attention to the awareness of anything (words used lightly) solved it. Headache immediately disappeared. This morning, it was banishing (magick) that worked.

What was the source of the headache? It varies. Sometimes writing posts and commentary online causes it, so I delete stuff. Other times texting family or friends, and they read it. Then there's this morning, where somebody in the house is thinking (I assume) and I can feel it.

So, I'm psychic. Hilarious. Very early in the spiritual seeking thing I wanted to be psychic. Now I'm all, ""okay, how do I turn it off?""

I'm not asking for help or theories. This is post is two-fold, and sponsored by coffee. 

First, there are no hard rules to this. Another way to say it is ""There's nowhere to stand,"" from Ram Dass. There's no way to remain as Awareness‚Äîwithout splitting yourself apart as some thing on one hand (maya, ego, etc.) and Awareness on the other. Whatever happens is immediately noticed without effort, whether there's a name for it or not.

Second, because there's no split anywhere and nowhere to stand (or no hard rules), anything is possible. I use lifting weights as an analogy. Sometimes it's hammer curls that gets it. Sometimes it's bicep curls.

Sometimes you don't work out.

That there are no hard rules (nowhere to stand) and anything is possible is itself the eradication of ego (maya, etc.) which is attachment to anything. This happens by itself.

But not as an idea. That would be holding on somewhere (to the idea).

1llxk3w,https://i.redd.it/1476nftwsh9f1.jpeg,Coffe spilt on MacBook Air m2,"How screwed am I?

MacBook Air 2022 m2 - spilt coffee over MacBook. I dried it all off and turned off laptop - MacBook kept turning back on whilst wiping keyboard. The screen had water marks appearing within the screen. I panicked and held down the off button and saw a pink screen for 2 seconds before powering off.

I left the MacBook for 3 hours before trying to power on so I can finish work - it will not power on and wouldn‚Äôt charge (no light coming on charger). I‚Äôve now left the MacBook upside down and will do so for a few days. How screwed am I? Anyone had a similar experience and it worked?

1llxjmm,https://youtu.be/hL3HqXhD_WE?si=NivaunWYBl9AD_gp,I spent 6+ years building a Mediterranean-inspired fantasy world ‚Äî curious what you think of of my introduction to it.,"So after six long years of quietly shaping this world in the background, between notebooks, coffee-stained concept drafts, and a lot of existential overthinking, I‚Äôve finally put together my first proper introduction to *The Triverse*, a world where **dreaming is forbidden**, and **the act of imagination is a threat to power**.

It‚Äôs a place deeply inspired by Mediterranean landscapes, theocratic systems, and the philosophy of control vs creativity. Think mythic authoritarian cities, cultural suppression of dreams, and a civilization where the law controls not what you *do*, but what you *think*.

I wanted to share the intro I made to this world (as a short 15-min narrated visual experience), but I‚Äôm more interested in **what you think of how I‚Äôve structured this introduction.**

* Does it help you understand the tone of the world?
* Does it feel alive or too abstract?
* Would you want to explore more of this setting?

I‚Äôm not here just to ‚Äúpromote‚Äù this project means the world to me, and I wanted to share it first with the only subreddit that might *actually get* what goes into building something like this.

Looking forward to thoughts, theories, and criticism.  
Let me know what stood out to you, or what you think could‚Äôve been stronger.  
I've attached the link to the video on the post.

Thanks a trillion!

Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Looking for any type of chats about anything or everything. Hppefully will be more long term but also down for short term chats too. I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best. Also want to start making different types of bread/sourdough so if know anything about that I would like to learn. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and ASA. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck to play on the go or in loving room tv.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",1,1751039957.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

About 2 months ago, I decided I was gonna build an Insta page and actually make money off it. Paid shoutouts, collabs, digital products ‚Äî the usual dream.

But real talk? Instagram reels will humble you FAST.

I started in the money niche (the whole sigma billionaire vibe). Uploaded my first reel thinking it‚Äôd blow up‚Ä¶ aaand it got 70 views. Not 70k. Seventy.

I kept posting, but it was just crickets. Felt like shouting into the void.

One night, couldn‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôm doom-scrolling reels like everyone else. And suddenly it clicks: every reel in my niche sounds the same. Same hooks. Same calls to action. But there was something else too‚Ä¶

People weren‚Äôt reinventing the wheel. They were literally snipping clips from famous influencers, remixing them a bit, slapping on captions‚Ä¶ and boom. Viral. Racks rolling in.

At first, I was salty AF. Like, damn ‚Äî these guys barely did any work and they‚Äôre cashing out. But then I thought‚Ä¶ screw it. Why not me?

So I tried it. Grabbed some viral reels, made some tweaks, re-uploaded‚Ä¶ and my page BLEW UP.

Since then, I‚Äôve been running 20+ Insta pages across different niches, pulling in solid income ‚Äî thanks to the exact same strategy.

Here‚Äôs the thing:  
Instead of grinding for hours creating fresh content from scratch, I built my own private stash:

* 50,000+ high-quality reels (tested to hit the algo)
* 5,000+ Canva-editable posts & stories
* 100,000+ ChatGPT prompts (seriously, they cover EVERYTHING)
* 900+ landing page templates (perfect for digital products)

Basically, it‚Äôs my secret sauce for spinning up new pages or scaling fast ‚Äî without creative burnout.

If you‚Äôre even¬†*thinking*¬†about starting an Insta page to monetize (or just wanna save yourself months of trial and error), DM me.

I‚Äôm not looking to get rich off this ‚Äî I‚Äôll share it for less than the cost of a Starbucks coffee.

Anyway, just thought I‚Äôd share the shortcut I wish I‚Äôd known sooner. Happy to help anyone who wants to skip the painful part.",3,1751039931.0,digitalproductselling,3,1.0,False

I am fairly decent with getting my teeth brushed. Not as good as I should be sometimes I miss a day or 2 due to just being stressed and busy with life. (Sounds dumb but not sure how else to put it.) But also noticing my teeth seem a little transparent on top of being discoloured (coffee likely culprit).

But I guess off a quick glance does it look like I have anything to worry about? Got a cleaning in about 2 weeks but looking to curb the stress before then.

Toronto hasn‚Äôt won a Cup since 1967, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the team lacks all-time greats. In fact, **6 of the top 11 Leafs won 4-plus Cups**, while others like Mats Sundin and Auston Matthews rewrote the record books in more recent eras.

Here‚Äôs a taste of the lineup:

üßä **Dave Keon** ‚Äì 4-time Cup champ and playoff beast by age 22 üí™ **Frank Mahovlich** ‚Äì Hard-nosed winger with 4 rings and fan favourite grit üéØ **Mats Sundin** ‚Äì Franchise leader in goals (420) and points (987) üèí **Auston Matthews** ‚Äì Modern-era scoring machine with 3 Rocket Richard Trophies üõë **Johnny Bower** ‚Äì Didn‚Äôt join until age 33 and still won 4 Cups in net

Also featured: legends like Darryl Sittler, B√∂rje Salming, George Armstrong, and the man behind the coffee empire ‚Äî **Tim Horton**.

From Hall of Famers to Calder and Hart Trophy winners, this list covers the icons who left their mark on Toronto and the NHL.

Guys like Alex Warren are perfect for capitalizing on it.","So you know what Muzak is right? Back in the day, there was a company called Muzak that specifically sold non-descript background music for setting the mood and background noise. You heard the stuff in stores, in elevators, in waiting rooms, in the background of TV shows and movies. It was cheap to license background music that set the mood. A few years ago, Mood Media purchased Muzak, and replaced the brand with ""Mood Media"", which tells you exactly what type of market positioning that this type of music has. 

  
Importantly, Muzak, and Muzak like services never impacted the charts, even though it was probably heard by billions of people simply because it was playing in the background. 

  
Nowadays, it seems like a lot of people have Spotify playlists play the role of ""background music"". You know the type - Summer Vibes 2025, Coffee House Vibes, Chill Vibes to Study to. These playlists get played over and over just to fill noise in the background. 

  
And you know what gets on these playlists? Bland, inoffensive music that isn't too fast, or too loud. The stuff that is perfect at a low volume in the background. 

  
Nowadays Billboard tracks all kinds of streams, without differentiating between intentional listening and background music. And I think getting on one of these playlists is probably doing wonders for your numbers. 

  
To use Alex Warren as an example - I searched him up in Spotify playlists. And sure, he gets into the top 40 lists, the #1 hits lists, and stuff like that. But you know what else puts Ordinary in? Look at the following list: 

* Cleaning Motivation 2025
* Summer Vibes 2025
* Songs to fall in love to
* 2025 Summer Camp/Classroom songs
* Wedding songs 2025
* Chilled pop 2025 relaxing songs
* Cafe Music 2025 Chill Vibes
* Morning Fall Vibes
* Roadtrip Songs

  
Among many others. 



These are vibes playlists! They play the role of background music! This is the stuff that Muzak used to do. By making bland, inoffensive pop, Alex Warren ends up on a lot of these. So when you ask, ""who really likes Ordinary? it's so bland."" Well, playlists creators looking for bland music to set the mood likes it, and they like it a lot.

I‚Äôm going to do research on that procedure at the university. Should I be concerned about the university trying to claim any patent for the procedure?

Hello everyone. I‚Äôm an undergraduate biochemistry student at a large state university, and I‚Äôve developed a novel procedure regarding coffee that requires a decent understanding of both coffee processing and biochemistry so I believe it isn‚Äôt obvious. I recently got approval to perform research in an university lab to demonstrate the feasibility of the procedure. I‚Äôm planning on using the university‚Äôs lab, glassware, expensive instruments, and possibly getting an undergraduate research grant to provide a small amount of money, but I‚Äôm providing brewing equipment and a large amount of other materials. From my reading, I believe the process would be a good utility patent, and could be used to great effect in the greater industry with easy adoption and a decent cost reduction compared to the current method. I have not started the research and I‚Äôm now worried the university might attempt to claim any patent I could produce from the research. Since I developed the procedure independent of the university, and the research is only attempting to demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure, should I be worried? Should I try to get a provisional patent prior to starting the research? Should I contact an attorney now or later? Should I modify my research proposal to clarify the procedure was developed outside of the research and the university? I know I‚Äôm kinda jumping the gun, but I‚Äôve been thinking about it and don‚Äôt want to screw myself down the line. Any insight would be greatly appreciated! (And sorry this post is so long)

I wanted to share the article below for background knowledge to discuss further. 

It seems like recognizing some of the mechanisms behind our habitual behaviors can help reprogram new ones. 

Do you think the negative reinforcement talked about in the article drives your own loops more or the positive reinforcement? What tips have worked for you to take more control over your phone usage?

# Habits: What makes a smartphone so hard to put down?

\[from a psychology [substack her](https://thecognitivepsychologist.substack.com/p/habits-what-makes-a-smartphone-so-hard-to-put-down)e, with permission\]

When's the last time you simply sat with your thoughts? When's the last time you let yourself be bored without turning to a screen like your phone or TV?

A classic series of experiments in 2014 asked people to sit alone with their thoughts for anywhere from 6 to 15 minutes without access to their phones or anything else (Wilson et al., 2014). The majority reported at least some difficulty concentrating and around half rated the experience as not enjoyable (below midpoint on a 9-point scale). Those trying this at their own home found it even less enjoyable than those doing it in an undecorated laboratory room, perhaps because their own forbidden devices were so close to hand (whereas in the lab version, their phone and other belongings weren't in the room with them). None of that is what made this research famous, though.

The crazy part of the study was a condition where participants in the lab first spent some time rating positive and negative stimuli (happy photos, a mild electric shock) and reported how much money they would pay to experience or avoid those things (if they were given $5 to spend, say). Not surprisingly, most people said they would pay to avoid the shock. But in the second half of the experiment, when again left alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes in a room without their phone or other belongings, a ton of participants chose to shock themselves.¬†

Indeed, among the people who earlier had said they'd pay to avoid the shock experience, now 67% of them (men) or 25% of them (women) found sitting with their thoughts so unpleasant they chose to shock themselves. Many of us really don't like to just sit without external stimulation.

It's no wonder, then, that so many of us are now in the habit of pulling out our phones at the prospect of even a moment unstimulated. Standing in line for coffee? Whip out your phone. Waiting for your partner to pee before leaving the house together? Phone time. Just finished a task on your phone and put it in your pocket? Somehow it ends up back in your hands again a moment later.

# How habits form: Positive and negative reinforcement

# One way to understand this habit we've all gotten into comes from the field of behavior analysis (aka behaviorism). As B.F. Skinner and decades of researchers after him have demonstrated, many of our habitual behaviors are maintained by reinforcing and punishing contingencies. What does that mean?

A *contingency* means that our environment (the literal environment, social environment, technical environment, laws of physics, whatever) is set up in such a way that *when we do a particular behavior in a given situation, there is a predictable outcome*.¬†

Sometimes the outcome is good, which is *reinforcing* for that behavior (making it more likely to occur in this situation in the future) and sometimes the outcome is bad, which is *punishing* for that behavior (making it less likely to occur in this situation in the future). So what might be reinforcing the behavior of almost-unconsciously pulling out your phone so often and in so many situations?

One way to think of it is in terms of *positive reinforcement* which is a contingency where doing the behavior predictably leads to the addition of some enjoyable stimulus. For example, sometimes you pull out your phone and see a notification of a text from your crush, or you play your favorite game, or you get some social media likes. In other words, doing the behavior was followed by some good stimulus showing up. It's *reinforcement* because this contingency means the behavior becomes more likely in this situation in the future, and it's *positive* because the behavior leads to some new stimulus being added (in this case, a stimulus you like).¬†

>

However, perhaps a more powerful influence on your phone behavior is something we call *negative reinforcement*. Negative reinforcement is when the environment is set up in such a way that doing a particular behavior predictably removes something from the situation (specifically, removing something aversive, something we dislike). In other words, the behavior predictably improves the immediate situation by taking away a bad thing -- so it's not surprising this would *reinforce* the behavior, making it more likely in this situation in the future.¬†

A common example of negative reinforcement is hitting snooze on an alarm clock. In the situation when the alarm clock is blaring noise, the behavior of hitting snooze is reinforcing because doing that behavior predictably removes the noise (it works, so of course we do it again in the future!). We call it *negative* because something is removed as a result of the behavior (in other words, think of the ""negative"" label as in ""subtraction"", not as in ""bad""). Another example of negative reinforcement would be taking an advil for a headache. In the situation when your head hurts, the behavior of taking an advil is reinforcing because doing that behavior predictably removes the headache (it works, so we're more likely to do the behavior again in this situation in the future). It's *negatively* reinforcing because it reinforces by *removing* something when we do the behavior.

>

# Negative reinforcement of phone use

Now consider the behavior of pulling out a smartphone and opening it up. What might reinforce or maintain that behavior?

Well, as we saw in the Wilson et al. (2014) study, being bored, unstimulated, or left alone with our thoughts seems to be unpleasant for a lot of us. Pulling out your phone removes that feeling; the behavior worked (at least in the short term moment), so of course we're more likely to do it again in the future. Negative reinforcement!¬†

>

The same thing applies if you've ever pulled your phone out when sad. By temporarily distracting from your unpleasant emotions, the behavior of opening your phone has removed something aversive, so your brain can't help but make this behavior more likely in the future next time you have that emotion.¬†

Before long, it's just a *habit* that you pull your phone out when bored, sad, uncomfortable, socially anxious, or...any other situation where the unpleasantness is temporarily relieved by looking at your phone.¬†

This is what behaviorist B.F. Skinner meant when we said that our behaviors are largely controlled by our past history of reinforcement (Skinner, 1974). It's probabilistic, but these contingencies and experiences have a major influence on what we do in a given situation.

# Intermittent positive reinforcement

Negative reinforcement isn't the only lesson behavior analysis can teach us to help understand our phone behaviors. As I said above, *positive reinforcement* is also involved in maintaining phone use when the behavior predictably adds some pleasant stimulus or feeling. For example, clicking the Instagram, TikTok, or Snapchat icon often leads to a positive experience: a funny meme or joke; a cute clip of a cat or toddler; a sexy influencer, cool car, or delicious-looking recipe. For that matter, seeing that someone has liked your post, status, or story, commented something positive, reshared it, or even just watching the views rise can feel good. And when do we get that little burst of good feeling? When we do the behavior of opening our phone, opening an app, swiping to the next item, posting something[2](https://thecognitivepsychologist.substack.com/p/habits-what-makes-a-smartphone-so-hard-to-put-down#footnote-2-165131704).

Of course, every time we do the behavior doesn't guarantee the addition of some good experience or feeling -- some enjoyable stimulus -- so how is it still positive reinforcement? Well, one thing Skinner studied extensively was *intermittent* positive reinforcement, meaning reinforcement that is predictably connected to a behavior, but where the reward doesn't occur every time the behavior is emitted. For example, rather than giving your dog a treat every time it does a trick, you might reward it every third time it performs the trick (we would call that FR3, a *fixed ratio* of 3, meaning 3 behaviors are required to get the reinforcer).¬†

A call center worker who gets a bonus for every 25 calls they make would also count as an intermittent reinforcement schedule, in this case FR25: a fixed ratio of 25 behaviors are required to get the bonus. On the other hand, a salesperson who tends to make a sale (and thus earn a juicy commission) on average every 12 or so cold calls that they make would be operating on a different type of intermittent schedule called *variable ratio*, VR (in this case VR12)[3](https://thecognitivepsychologist.substack.com/p/habits-what-makes-a-smartphone-so-hard-to-put-down#footnote-3-165131704).¬†

In both cases, FR and VR, there is some predictability to the environmental contingency: the behavior does indeed lead to reward with some sort of consistency.

And for ratio schedules like this (where reward comes either when you've done the behavior an exact number of times or done it a certain number of times on average) we tend to get a *relatively high rate of behavior*. Why? Because the reward is under your control. The more you do the behavior, the more reward you'll get in general (unlike what we call *interval* schedules where the behavior's payoff is tied to how much time has passed).¬†

# Slot machine phones

And variable ratio (VR) schedules in particular have the highest and most consistent rate of behavior. Why would a variable setup (say, rewarded every 10 or so behaviors on average) lead to more behavior than a fixed setup (rewarded every 10 behaviors exactly)?

For one thing, the fixed ratio is *too* predictable: if it always takes 50 lever presses for a lab rat to get a treat, then when they finally reach that payoff and get their treat, their brain basically knows that the next behavior won't lead to a treat, nor the ones right after that for quite a while. (Indeed, this is why we get a *post-reinforcement pause* with fixed ratio schedules -- the reward is itself predictive that the very next behavior won't pay off). But now imagine that sometimes that lever leads to a reward after 50 presses, other times after 25 presses, other times after 70, or 10, or 60, or even 1.

That's what a variable ratio schedule is like: on average it might be 50 lever presses to get the treat, but sometimes it comes much sooner. In fact, it could be this very next time I do the behavior! Oh, that didn't work? Well, it still could pay off this next time! Still nope? Well, the next behavior might work.¬†

Variable ratio reinforcement in essence leads to a sense that you're always on the verge of getting the reward. Doing more of the behavior definitely leads to more payoff (it's a ratio schedule, after all), and any instance of the behavior could hit the jackpot, so you keep going and going and going.

This is why slot machines are programmed with a variable ratio reinforcement schedule. The programmers know from decades of behavior analytic research in animals and humans that variable ratio reinforcement will keep the user doing the behavior (pulling the slot machine lever) at a *high and consistent rate*, without so much as a post-reinforcement pause. Our behavior is to a significant extent controlled by the schedules of reinforcement that are embedded in our environments.

Now think about the modern smartphone:

* Swiping through profiles on a dating app? Variable ratio reinforcement. Many profiles aren't a good fit, but sometimes (on average every X swipes) you run into someone you like.¬†
* Scrolling TikTok or swiping through Instagram reels? Variable ratio reinforcement. Not every one presented to you will be a banger, but on average every X TikToks or reels will provide you some amusement, joy, insight, horniness, or other positive boost.
* Opening your messaging app to see if it's a fun, positive text from a valued friend or just an appointment reminder? Variable ratio reinforcement.¬†
* Those addictive-feeling mobile games on your phone? They also use tricks like variable ratio reinforcement when dishing out in-game rewards (Lewis et al., 2012).¬†

Between negative reinforcement (phone use removing boredom and other unpleasant feelings in the short run) and intermittent positive reinforcement with powerful schedules like variable ratio, it's no wonder we have trouble putting our phones down![4](https://thecognitivepsychologist.substack.com/p/habits-what-makes-a-smartphone-so-hard-to-put-down#footnote-4-165131704)

# Pushes on your behavior

I started thinking about this after listening to the May 16th 2025 episode of the podcast Search Engine hosted by P.J. Vogt (""[How to stop being so phone addicted, without discipline or meditation](https://www.searchengine.show/how-to-stop-being-so-phone-addicted-without-self-discipline-or-meditation/)""). The host P.J. Vogt and his guest discuss what people colloquially describe as ""phone addiction"", and share their nostalgia for an earlier era of technology, an earlier internet, an earlier type of phone. An era when technology had less power over us, when you went to a device (like the desktop computer) to do a specific task rather than having an all-encompassing device ubiquitously attached at the hip everywhere we go.

I miss those days too. Even smartphones didn't always act the way they do now, poking us with non-stop pings, dings, badges, blinks, previews, and other attention-demanding notifications. Ironically, a push notification style of design was originally popularized as a *solution* to an addiction-like behavior.¬†

With early email systems, you actively did something to check if any new emails had come in (and sometimes -- variable ratio -- you were rewarded with a fun new email, back when emails were less likely to involve bills, work, or responsibilities). But that intermittent reinforcement meant the email-checking behavior became problematic for some people: you would find yourself opening/refreshing/pulling from the server way more often than would be ideal.¬†

Push-style notification for something like email was seen as a solution, then. No need to constantly check and check and check to see if that important reply from your boss or your crush had come in; you'll get a ding when there's a new email.

But as Vogt and his guest talk about, push notifications turned out to create their own problems. Now, if we don't vigilantly adjust settings for every app we use, we're absolutely *bombarded* with annoying notifications vying for our attention and trying to control our behavior. It works, of course (O'Brien et al., 2022). Without prompting, you might not think of this app or that app throughout the day. Indeed, you might only go to the app when you actually have an intention and overt desire to use it!¬†

But that's not what the app designers want: they want you to open the app as often as possible to get your attention, your time, your money, your eyeballs on their ads.¬†

In other words, app designers hijack push technology to make us do things that are in *their* best interest rather than *our* best interest. Especially for ad-supported or microtransaction-supported apps, we users really are in an adversarial relationship with the designers. For example, designs are rife with *dark patterns*, interfaces made to deliberately deceive users into performing actions against their best interest (Di Geonimo et al., 2020). App designers are not incentivized to provide the best user experience or leave us fulfilled and happy with our app use; they are incentivized to manipulate our behavior to maximize their profit.

This is part of the story of *enshittification* that I'll discuss in Part II of this blog post, but first Vogt and his guest provide some tips for improving our relationship with our smartphone.

# Fighting the urge, breaking the habit

The podcast episode covers various suggestions to battle the ""addictiveness"" of modern smartphones.

First off, they dismiss some initial ideas as ineffective or unrealistic for most users. Dumbphones, for example, may sound appealing: you can't get addicted to apps or functions that your phone can't even handle. However, it's hard to strike the right balance when it comes to which functions to allow or not allow on a device: sometimes you really do want map navigation, for example. Or you need something beyond basic text messaging like Signal or WhatsApp to stay in touch with your friends or do your work. Before long, you either can't function in the modern world (give up too much) or you've ended up with a fairly typical smartphone full of too many attention-grabbing distractions.

Other tips they cover are more promising. For example, keeping your phone out of your bedroom when you sleep: you can't mindlessly scroll [brain rot](https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/brain-rot) late into the night or waste an hour of your Saturday morning on TikTok if your phone isn't right there on the nightstand with you. ""But I use it as my alarm to wake up!"" you may protest. Thankfully an alarm clock is a very cheap purchase, and many have music, white noise, and other helpful functions built in.

The guest also shares something he's found helpful: he plugs his phone into a charging cable in one specific place in his home and doesn't remove it from that cable when he's home. Basically, if you want to use your phone, you have to sit here in the phone-using chair. Come here when you have an intention and want to use it, not because it happens to be to-hand in a moment you get bored or because it dings a push notification guilting you for not playing Dessert Smash 3 in the last couple hours. (This solution may not be realistic for many of us, though).

There are also classic suggestions like Tristan Harris' suggestion to [make your screen grayscale](https://lifehacker.com/change-your-screen-to-grayscale-to-combat-phone-addicti-1795821843) to diminish the power of psychological tricks of shiny color (*red badges on apps urging you to clear the notification! color associations for the icon of an addictive-like app!*). And indeed, social media brain rot is a lot less reinforcing when the memes are in black and white, the influencers in grayscale, the cats in monochrome.¬†

I discuss some other tips in one of my lecture videos ([Dopamine and Dark Pattern Defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwWF4hE66xM)) about technology-related behavior in my Behavior Analysis and Learning course on YouTube.

Meanwhile, though, if you find this interesting, please continue on to Part II of this blog post, [*Enshittification: What is it and why is it coming for artificial intelligence?*](https://thecognitivepsychologist.substack.com/p/enshittification-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-coming-for-artificial-intelligence)

[1](https://thecognitivepsychologist.substack.com/p/habits-what-makes-a-smartphone-so-hard-to-put-down#footnote-anchor-1-165131704)

More examples of negative reinforcement:  
Behavior: rubbing hands on a towel. Removes annoying wet-hand feeling (removes bad thing). Increases future behavior of rubbing hands on a towel (in the context of having just washed your hands).  
Behavior: blasting car horn. Removes annoying car driving slow in front of you (removes bad thing). Increases future behavior of blasting car horn (in the context of following someone slow).  
Behavior: kid screaming when parents put hated food in front of him. Removes the hated food (parents give in and take away the plate when he screams, thus removing the bad thing). Increases kid‚Äôs future screaming behavior (in the context of hated food placed in front of him).  
Behavior: putting on oven mitts to get something out of the microwave. Removes painful heat (removes bad thing). Increases use of oven mitts in the future (in context of handling heated food containers).  
Behavior: leave the room / run away from phobia animal. Removes the fear by getting away from animal you have phobia of (removes bad thing). Increases the leave room / run away (escape) behavior in the future (in the context of being near the object of the phobia), thus making the phobia even stronger.

[2](https://thecognitivepsychologist.substack.com/p/habits-what-makes-a-smartphone-so-hard-to-put-down#footnote-anchor-2-165131704)

I refuse to say ‚Äúdopamine burst‚Äù because that‚Äôs not how dopamine works, as I explain in one of my free YouTube [lectures on tech-related behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwWF4hE66xM). Dopamine isn‚Äôt a pleasure chemical that rewards us when we do a behavior. It‚Äôs better to think of it more like one part of a reward-expectation or reward-prediction learning system. Indeed, we get a burst of dopamine when a slot machine *misses* if it looks close to winning (a ‚Äúnear miss‚Äù; Habib & Dixon, 2010).

[3](https://thecognitivepsychologist.substack.com/p/habits-what-makes-a-smartphone-so-hard-to-put-down#footnote-anchor-3-165131704)

I describe other common schedules of reinforcement in [this YouTube lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKtw3qVwMIM) and [the one after it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idfIf0SV6hU) as part of my free Behavior Analysis and Learning [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R7EQg7lMrE&list=PLz-pxsFiarvJSppoDt-jjmRv--KC9AASU).

[4](https://thecognitivepsychologist.substack.com/p/habits-what-makes-a-smartphone-so-hard-to-put-down#footnote-anchor-4-165131704)

Obviously, in addition to the schedule of reinforcement, other variables like the size of reinforcement also matter. The take away is that we are sensitive to and conform our behavior to (i.e. learn) the reward structure of our environment. Indeed, Lindstrom et al. (2021) confirmed this on a large scale for social media posting behavior by analyzing over a million posts and showing that reward learning mechanisms drive posting (how much and how far apart people post ""maximize\[s\] the average rate of accrued social rewards"").

Hi all. I would appreciate some guidance on this topic. My maternal grandmother is 87 and lives in SC with my mother and my father. Grandma has two other sons - Son A in Washington, and Son B in Louisiana. Grandma has advanced Alzheimer‚Äôs with dementia. After her husband passed away, she moved in with my parents, but Son B was in control of her finances. Son B was constantly monitoring each penny my grandmother had access to, and often calls to scold my parents for taking her out for coffee or similar small treats. Around Thanksgiving of 2024, Grandma went to stay with Son B for about a month and a half with the intention of seeing if she might thrive there, as she has had a hard time adjusting to living in SC. However this did not work. Son B‚Äôs wife was verbally abusive and constantly angry about the situation. Grandma returned home to SC and has since improved and stabilized. Recently, Son A (an investment banker) was on the phone with my mom and realized that something wasn‚Äôt adding up monetarily with the SSI checks. He created a spreadsheet and tracked expenses dating all the way back to when Grandma first arrived in SC. It turns out that Son B (and/or his wife) has been helping himself to the funds, to the tune of around $1,900/month. Son B has always insisted he manage Grandma‚Äôs funds of any kind, and none of us thought he would be trying to pull one over on us. He only recently has begun behaving in a manner that threw up red flags for me personally: he fought my mom on the idea of her becoming the POA for Grandma, and he has fought against the idea of an ALF for her. My mom and I are both RNs, so it was very important to both of us that we secure the POA as well as have a high quality ALF selected because she and I have both seen what happens when families wait too long to get that sorted. We have since secured POA, but Son B refuses to allow my mother access to my grandmother‚Äôs bank account. My mother instead has received deposits in her bank account generated by Son B.

Considering the fact that Son B does not contribute to the care or maintenance of Grandma, is the discrepancy in funds something we can take action for? It is causing a major rift in the family and is taking a toll on my parents. I am having a hard time sifting through the theories on what is considered financial abuse in SC. Any input is appreciated and I am happy to provide more info and answer any questions. Thank you for any assistance you could provide! ",2,1751038556.0,legaladvice,6,1.0,False
1llwy16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1llwy16/perim_and_brain_fog_elimination/,Perim and Brain Fog Elimination,"So, I have been feeling horrible brain fog in addition to some other peri symptoms.  But, the brain fog was the worst.  Feeling drunk everyday without the fun, I worried about all the work I put into being able to support myself through my whole life, and now, I feel like I can't. Is it the beginning of the end?

Turns out, brain fog is a result of brain inflammation. So, I started taking turmeric, ginger, and ashwaghanda. All very powerful anti-inflammatories.  I also found out months ago that I have elevated cholesterol, so I started using oatmilk instead of regular creamer.  Looked into it, oatmilk can cause brain fog in some people, so I cut that out.  

A biohacker at my work also informed me eating an apple in the morning can be more energizing than coffee, so I have started eating an apple with one small cup of coffee.

All in all, feeling much better, almost back to normal. But I am thinking of doing an elimination diet to find out what other foods are having an effect on me as instead of having an awareness of what foods are doing to my body, I automatically think something is wrong with me.

I'm currently struggling with the concept if I can afford a car payment. I'd like to purchase a vehicle next spring and in my head the idea of putting $50k outright in a vehicle makes less sense than financing at a favorable rate (assuming there is one). My current budget works out to:

* 45% necessities ($3207)
* 37% investments ($3000)
* 12% residual ($503)
* 4% wants ($320)
* 2% subscriptions ($112)

Generally speaking I don't want to own a home, not for at least 3-5 years, but I max out my FHSA at the beginning of every year with my tax return so that I don't have to think about it. Right now I don't see my income increasing drastically over that period unless I move to a new role, however my partners could increase 2-3x given that she just finished her masters and is now applying for ""real"" jobs. Neither of us have debt, and I have a funded emergency fund (this chart doesnt include her investments as her cashflow in much less). I haven't really thought about FIRE, I just want to be comfortable. I would like to know people's opinions in terms of what would be reasonable for a vehicle? I've only ever purchased used cars in the past, but I have an itch for a new Golf R (this would be a car that I keep). Interest rates are way too high right now at 6.99%, but I've seen promos as low as 0% and 0.9%. Given my budget, would I be insane to take on a car payment? I would plan to do this next spring, and save accordingly now for a larger down-payment (have $15k set aside now). I work hard but I don't spend genuinely out of worry, but could I loosen up? am I putting too much in RRSP?

1llwtol,https://i.redd.it/za6hv0agnh9f1.png,Sony LinkBuds S vs AirPods Pro 2 : Which earbuds are worth your daily life?,"

Just upgraded after my old WF-1000XM4s finally started dying on me‚Äîbattery barely lasting a commute, Bluetooth cutting out mid-song, the usual end-of-life drama. I decided to compare two of the most reliable options in 2025: the Sony LinkBuds S ¬†and AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C). I‚Äôve used both daily over the past few weeks in every scenario from work calls to walks through the park. Here‚Äôs what stood out.

The LinkBuds S completely caught me off guard. I was walking through the city listening to a quiet Novo Amor track, and I legit stopped mid-step just to take it in. The sound is warm, clear, and detailed, especially with vocals and acoustic instruments. ANC is incredible‚Äîit blocks out subway noise, background chatter, even my loud air purifier. I‚Äôve never used noise cancelling that felt this natural.

Also, they‚Äôre so light. I wore them for nearly 4 hours straight while writing in a coffee shop and totally forgot they were in. Sony‚Äôs adaptive mode is smarter now too‚Äîit actually knows when I‚Äôm walking, sitting, or riding the train, and changes modes without being annoying or jarring.

Then there‚Äôs the AirPods Pro 2, which are still super impressive. If you're in the Apple ecosystem like I am, they‚Äôre basically magic. Instant pairing, automatic switching between devices‚Äîit‚Äôs effortless. The Spatial Audio with head tracking makes movie soundtracks or ambient playlists feel really immersive. Sound quality is clean, though slightly less rich than the Sonys. I do find the fit a bit looser, though. They‚Äôre fine for calls or light movement, but I‚Äôve had them shift while walking fast or eating (weird, but true).

Honestly, I thought I‚Äôd stick with AirPods for convenience, but I keep reaching for the LinkBuds S when I want to really listen. They‚Äôve become my go-to for walks, writing, and zoning out from the noise around me. That said, I still use AirPods Pro 2 for Zoom calls and quick listening during errands. Both are excellent, but they serve different moods.

I barely found out about it a few weeks back when I met with a woman I've been talking to lately. I tried using Uber and found no cars at all until she told me Didi is most often used over there. Sure enough I was able to take her home trough it. 

I do plan on seeing her regularly, once a week. But I'm also asking for that but for any solo trips. I'm not used to going over there and I enjoy myself a lot when I do, above anything I enjoy the food, and being able to walk just about anywhere and finding snacks or desserts to have after lunch. Here in Laredo, I'm usually like doing stuff alone like eating at our local restaurants and coffee shops. My weekends are usually spent alone going all over Laredo and finding stuff to do/eat. And I want to start doing that but in Nuevo Laredo. 

Normally I cross on foot through the old bridge. So again I'd be using Didi consistently. 

In 2025, how dangerous would it being doing this often, like once or twice a week? What are some rules of traveling to Nuevo Laredo, any areas to avoid in particular? What to do if by chance a cartel member stops you? Better to use the cabs or is Didi fine enough? ",0,1751038033.0,laredo,4,0.5,False

**From: Mohammed (Moroccan Math Teacher)**
**Subject: Your Algorithms Are Cute - Here's Real Market Mathematics**

Dear Finance Giants,

Greetings from a coffee shop in Morocco! üá≤üá¶‚òï

I've been watching your quant teams struggle with market prediction for years now. Very adorable attempts! But I think there might be a small issue with your approach - you're using 17th-century probability theory that I recently proved is fundamentally broken.

I've developed something called ""Humble Systems Theory"" that explains why your models keep crashing during black swan events. Turns out the ""impossible"" events you can't predict aren't actually impossible - they're just emerging from the empty set that your algorithms ignore.

**What I'm offering:**
- **""Speculation on Computational Market Efficiency""** - a 20-page research document
- Mathematical framework that explains why your best quants get humbled by reality
- Algorithmic trading principles based on actual information processing theory
- The reason why my $0 budget outperforms your billion-dollar trading floors

**Fun fact:** This PDF was generated in collaboration with Claude AI - yes, an AI helped create mathematics that will outperform your human quant teams. The irony is delicious.

**Investment required:** $5,000 (yes, five thousand - that's like 0.0001% of your coffee budget)

Don't worry, I won't tell anyone that a high school math teacher from Africa, working with an AI, solved problems your Harvard graduates couldn't figure out. üòâ

**Payment:** Bitcoin only (your traditional banking systems don't work where I live - ironic, isn't it?)

Warmest regards from the real financial frontier,

Mohammed
*Inventor of the mathematics your computers wish they understood*

P.S. - When you inevitably implement HST principles in your systems, a small acknowledgment would be nice. You know, for historical accuracy. üìö

I am in a 2 year long distance relationship. This relationship is the greatest dynamic I have ever been lucky enough to experience up until me recently finding something out that greatly hurt me. 

My boyfriend works in an industry of mainly women. His entire office is full of ladies which was intimidating to me at first I tried to be casual about it except for one girl who trained him at the start who I immediately had a tummy feeling about. She was super bubbly towards him and even immediately asked him for his social media and invited him to her going away dinner (as she was leaving her role that he was filling and was moving on to another position elsewhere at a completely different job). He didn‚Äôt end up going to the dinner but they did exchange socials. He would also talk about her all the time but emphasize she was ugly to him and I needn‚Äôt worry (she‚Äôs gorgeous and smart and funny). 

After she left, they would still communicate as he would have questions about his role and so on. I thought they stopped talking ages ago because when I‚Äôd ask about her or if they‚Äôd spoken he would say ‚Äúno we don‚Äôt talk anymore‚Äù or ‚Äúnope, I haven‚Äôt heard from her.‚Äù 

However, during my last visit to him he had left his work email up on his monitor and I saw a chat opened with her! The messages were from that day and they were not about work. I know this is wrong but I scrolled and scrolled and found months worth of them messaging one another all day long Monday through Friday. (They have talked everyday since he started the job even though she left). They never spoke about work. They would talk about their days, their dreams, wanting coffee, etc. There were a few flirty emojis and gifs. One of the messages from him was like ‚Äúwell then you better go make some coffee missy‚Äù and some from her were like (jokingly) ‚Äúdo you want me to go make you some coffee üòâ?‚Äù (They both worked from home that day). He‚Äôd tell her when he was laying down in bed on the job or when he didn‚Äôt feel good and she would tell him about her personal life as did he. Mind you- he doesn‚Äôt text me during work because it‚Äôs ‚Äúdistracting‚Äù and he needs to focus on work. But messaging her all day even during meetings isn‚Äôt the same?

They would message good morning and good night everyday. I don‚Äôt know if they message on Instagram or any other platform. He told me she had a boyfriend but I never saw her message about him so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs true. 

Sure maybe this is all innocent but from having the belief that these two didn‚Äôt speak at all to finding out in a moment that not only do these two speak but all day everyday? It hurt me so badly. And also why are they staying in contact if they are no longer coworkers? And never talking about work stuff? I also should mention that he didn‚Äôt tell her about me until 3 months ago. And that is  only because she found out by ‚Äúnot stalking‚Äù his instagram and saw me in his profile photo. To where he said ‚Äúyeah she and I met online üò¨ We will see how it goes‚Äù. We had been dating almost two years at that point. And have talked about marriage in depth. I‚Äôve met his family multiple times. We are planning our future. And that‚Äôs what he tells this girl who knows everything else about him?

I‚Äôm okay with female friends so long as I know about them? Why did he lie about this one? Why wouldn‚Äôt he have told her about me and how wonderful our relationship is?

Of course he blamed me and told me that he knew if I found out that I would make a big deal out of it like I was doing now. That there was no motive behind it- they are just friendly and she messages everyone like that. And also that everyone on teams sends heart emojis and winky faces so he thought to do the same. He talks to other women in his office. Why aren‚Äôt I bothered by them? And I try to explain to him that it‚Äôs different to small talk people he works with in office than to open up teams and message this girl that he doesn‚Äôt work with all day long every single day. And he admitted he doesn‚Äôt do that with anybody else he just hasn‚Äôt realized it at the time. That his morning routine is saying hello to everyone in the office so part of his routine is saying good morning to her too as he considers her a ‚Äúwork- mate‚Äù still and wants to keep networking. Mind you- he doesn‚Äôt even talk to his childhood friends nor his family everyday. So what is it about this girl?

He also will say that he didn‚Äôt realize the extent of their conversations until I pointed it out so he never thought to tell me but then will also tell me that there were so many times he wanted to tell me about their conversations so we could talk about it but he was scared to tell me because of how I would react. So he contradicts himself? And still the blame gets shifted on to me. 

It irritates me that he is a grown man who has free will and could have set a boundary with her a long time ago on his own accord without me finding out. He has apparently since stopped talking to her but I hate that I had to find out and ask for that to happen. And how can I trust that they truly aren‚Äôt still talking? Or talking on another platform? It‚Äôs odd to believe that two people can go from talking all day everyday to suddenly not talking at all. 

It hurts because I know if I had never seen those messages that they still would be talking like that and he would still be lying to me. I had expressed discomfort about her over a year ago and rather than try to honor our trust without anyone holding him to it- he chose to omit the truth for the luxury of still getting to talk to her all day? I don‚Äôt know. And it hurts because he would always tell me my anxieties hurt him and why couldn‚Äôt I trust him. And then what did he do? Prove those worries right. And I feel insane because I was right to worry and I was gaslit the entire time!

He swears that they never flirted nor that he likes her. He states if he did want her then why wouldn‚Äôt he pursue her especially as he and I are long distance. But apparently she has a boyfriend so maybe they were flirting with on another at work because both felt a lack in their own relationships? And he can‚Äôt pursue her until she is single so he‚Äôs just stringing me along for who knows why? Again he doesn‚Äôt talk to his other coworkers/ friends like he does to her. 

It‚Äôs hard for me to move past it because his consensus is that he lied because I‚Äôm jealous and he felt that then he couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone. Which is not true because he has plenty of female friends- most of them are girls. And I‚Äôm okay with it because I know them and I am aware of the dynamic. There‚Äôs no deceit in that regard. 

I just feel like if there wasn‚Äôt something there with this girl then he wouldn‚Äôt have had to lie. I am having such a hard time moving past this especially since he still gets defensive when I try to talk about it. Like I trigger his shame or something. He yelled at me when I found out and I didn‚Äôt like that at all. And will still huff and puff and tell me to let it go or yell ‚Äúthen why are you still with me if you hate me?‚Äù I don‚Äôt hate him. I just want him to take accountability and to care about hurting me. 

I know he loves me because he has stayed with me through some really hard times. And he is with me despite the distance when he could easily choose someone closer/ better. 

I love this man and truly saw myself getting married to him and growing old but I cannot move past this for some reason. Can anyone please help me? Am I reading too much into this? I don‚Äôt want to lose the love of my life if I am just being some meanie about something so small?

1. We have a ""camping table"" that I used in our garage (door open!) to season the griddle, but while it's rated for the weight of the griddle, the slats under the legs flexed more than I was comfortable with.  Any suggestions on a lightweight, collapsible table we could use?  I thought about getting the Blackstone stand, but the reviews of that seem so-so.  

2. Can you put a small teapot / kettle on the griddle to boil water for the all-important morning coffee?  Or will I be better off continuing to use our smaller Coleman 2 burner camp stove?  

3. Can we use the griddle if we put it on the tailgate of our pickup truck, basically tailgating with it?  The bed of the truck does have a professionally applied spray-in bedliner, my concern here would be the heat from the griddle damaging the liner.  

&nbsp;  

Now, you may laugh at us for this, we haven't yet actually cooked anything on the griddle!  We do have a camping trip scheduled in a couple weeks, though, and it is going along and it is going to get used (it's us and a couple friends.)",1,1751037811.0,blackstonegriddle,0,1.0,False

both can only be felt halfway through a conversation.

Swaying under other people‚Äôs gazes,
I quietly carve away my own sense of place, unseen by anyone.

I know the line between right and wrong,
yet my body refuses to remember it.

Only stillness records, with perfect accuracy,
the sound of something breaking each day.

Things I‚Äôve forgotten, moments I chose not to see,
voices I lost‚Äîall hardening inside a drawer
until it won‚Äôt open anymore.

The morning coffee that God abandoned me to
slides down my throat, leaving bitterness behind.

The self I could never confess
briefly clears in the first light of dawn,
yet still carries the shadows within.

Even when I picture the edge of the universe,
all I see is a daily life with peeling wallpaper.

What I destroy isn‚Äôt only what seems fragile;
emotions that were supposed to stay intact,
words repeated like a chant‚Äî
I keep shattering them with subtle silences.

It still hasn‚Äôt stopped.

This destruction can‚Äôt be measured in good or evil;
only in the depth of quiet
I add one more piece of it today.

And tomorrow, in a place no one can see,
I‚Äôll choose another small collapse.

I‚Äôll greet an unchanging morning,
pretending something has changed.

##Event Details

The Of Dice and Dens Podcast is proud to announce that we are once again putting on our three day online streaming marathon of tabletop gaming one-shots to help raise money for Boise‚Äôs [Simply Cats](https://simplycats.org/), a cage free, no-kill cat shelter. The online streaming event will be held June 27-29, from 12pm to 8pm Mountain time.

Initially conjured up in 2020 during the shutdown, the Meowrathon started as a half-baked idea to run a live-streamed one-shot adventure to supplement Simply Cats‚Äô donations through the statewide crowd-funding event, Idaho Gives. Within a week it had grown into a [two-day extravaganza of 6 games](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9cto3DV0f-w-w-vBTT54xupOPM3c3aIZ). We were joined by folks not only from all over the country, but from all over the world! We were also able to entice [Captain Shaw himself, Todd Stashwick](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Stashwick) to join us! We were able to raise $1,550 to help cats and kittens find homes.

Thanks to the success and fun of the first year, we decided to turn it into a yearly event, only bigger, moving to three days. With more time to plan we were able to have a wider variety of games and more Idaho locals to play with. Since then we‚Äôve had lots of great folks help us out. Todd came back and brought a bunch of his friends with him, including David Blue and Alicia Marie! Our very own Jason Klamm also managed to wrangle James Urbaniak and Riley Silverman to join us in a game. In the last few years we‚Äôve raised over $5,500 for Simply Cats.

If you or someone you know would be interested in participating, either as a player or game host, or if you just want to watch along please feel free to visit https://Meowrathon.com.

Well, she ended up reporting me to my boss afterwards, and I ended up getting investigated for harassment. I just found it all a little but frustrating, I listened to some of my coworkers and decided to ask her out over text message just so that I wouldn't have to stop her while she's working and put her on the spot, I know some people are like that and I just wanted to be respectful, that was my mistake and I should've just asked her out in person. I simply asked her if wanted to get a coffee sometime, and that if she didn't want to, that it is totally fine and that I would not bother her, but I guess that wasn't enough. I guess I'm just here to ask if I'm really in the wrong or am I over thinking things, sometimes I just feel like she reported me to get some extra points to be frank.

1llw9ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1llw9ip/what_happened_to_ordering_in_the_cafe_it_seems_so/,What happened to ordering in the cafe? It seems so chaotic.,"Slight rant, I‚Äôm trying not to complain but I really want to talk through this. It‚Äôs been my first time going inside to order in a few years‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm just baffled at how the store handles cafe vs drive thru orders now.  We had a pretty decent party, about 6 people and we decided to go in because I remembered when I was a partner how stressful a large drive through order could be.  

Here was my order just for some context: 
2 venti iced waters
2 grande iced waters
2 grande iced coffees 
2 venti iced coffees
1 grande brewed coffee
1 grande lavender matcha 

Why was my order split up? It seems we waited for about 30 minutes for everything to come out and that was with a barista constantly checking in to see what we were still waiting for. There was a barista working the hand off with an iPad and she kept asking what I‚Äôm waiting for and when I‚Äôd tell her what was missing, she‚Äôd mess around in the iPad and then say she ‚Äúpushed it‚Äù. What does that mean? Do tickets get split up even if they are all on the same order?

These all came out maybe one every 5 minutes and people behind us who ordered were getting their drinks before us. Do drinks not get made in the order they were received? I thought it was so odd, especially the hot brewed coffee, that was the last one and the barista looked a bit annoyed when I told her, not at us but almost like at someone else who should‚Äôve probably got it? She was working hot bar so she had to walk away to get it. There was someone I heard saying he was doing support, but he also took my order, was working warming and was working cold bar, I felt bad for him because he was going in all directions. 

Can someone explain this new system to me? I‚Äôm really not trying to complain but I‚Äôm just so baffled. Is it honestly better to just do drive thru now? I know cafe takes more time but I just wasn‚Äôt expecting 30 minutes and our order (which tbh I thought were pretty simple drinks) to take a full 30 minutes. ",3,1751036893.0,starbucks,3,1.0,False

In my dream, I was in the Holy Land in the week leading up to the Crucifixion. I was walking in a surprisingly empty street, in what I assume was Jerusalem, when I saw Jesus walking alone in the distance. I was not close enough to see His face, but I started following Him discretely. 

I followed Him through a set of doors, and we were not in the Holy Land anymore. We were in only what I can describe as the basement of an industrial building. Cool, damp, dark, with cement block and peeling paint. On the other end was another set of steel doors, which we walked through, into a small coffee shop. 

I caught up to Jesus as He was serving himself coffee from a machine into a little foam cup. I looked into His face as he took a sip. He sighed and looked down at me. There was kindness, but also sorrow in his eyes. 

He said, ""I have to go back. You should not be here. This is not the place for you. I'm going to drop you off at \[I think Peter's mother\]'s house, and the others will join you."" 

I tried to plead with Him that I wanted to stay with Him, but instead, He put me in the entry of a small town home. I tried to chase Him though the door, but He was gone. The only thing out there was an empty, dim street, though, in the distance I could see a sparkling bay of blue water and a brilliant orange sunrise. 

I was heartbroken. I cried and screamed, and my heart felt like it had been yanked out of my chest. I couldn't feel anything except sorrow and pain. I cried and cried and cried for hours, until I had no energy left and felt like a husk with only sorrow left. I would say it might have been Hell, except there was a small amount of space for something other than torment. When I was done crying and just sitting there in forlorn numbness, an older woman (Peter's mother?) gathered me up and said, ""the others will be here soon."" I was curious and excited, even though I previously thought I had nothing left but misery. 

And then the Apostles started showing up. ",1,1751036840.0,Catholicism,1,1.0,False

I had 10 physical servers connected to that switch, all clustered, all MS Windows Server 2022 Core.

After finally re-gaining access to my servers, I found out that one of them is quarantined in the Failover Cluster manager.

I did not manage to bring the cluster back online, and ""ClusSvc"" could not be started no matter what I did.

So I removed the server from the cluster, then uninstalled the failover cluster feature on Server10, and re-installed it.

I tried to run Import-Module FailoverClusters, but it still failed.

Went for a coffee to calm myself. When I came back, I tried to add the Server10 to the cluster via GUI, but it miraculously worked.

*Vilantia Prime, Throne City, Ministry of Culture*

The Ministry of Culture was a monument to the Vilantian people. For over a thousand years the ministry had been the unchallenged guardians and judges of what was appropriate and what was uncouth. It was a position that they had kept and maintained through times of fat and times of lean, with the guiding star of the Clan Way as laid down by the First Throne being refined only as absolutely necessary by Minister Aa'benie and her ancestors for thirty three generations. They had never been led by a commoner.

Until now. Minister Larine still hadn't fully decorated her office - her ministerial robes and chain of office had been hung carefully at the door, while she listened to what was quickly becoming her favored daily activity; reviewing common-garde music. It had always been the responsibility of the Ministry to review all artistic works for their potential effects on the mindset of the citizenry. It was an easy task in most times, with the songs of generations past simply being re-arranged or set to new instrumentation. More than a few of the clans known for artistic expression were now producing works that were challenging the regime. The backlog had exploded in the past months - worse, she'd received reports from various security teams that some clans were bypassing the formal approval process entirely and simply broadcasting using ancient radio technology based on amplitude that had quickly fallen out of favor once scent-transmission had been perfected. Some of the songs were quite catchy - despite the lyrics being dangerously contrary to the Clan Way.

All of this on top of placating those who supposedly answered to her as they incessantly complained about the other ministries failure to heed their demands. What was worse was the Localgrid. Someone in the Ministry of Science had implemented independent Nodes that were uncontrolled by the Ministry, and the things one found there were deviant at best and obscene at worst. The most disconcerting of these were the Barrens; individuals who wore tight clothing to make it appear that they had shaved or in extreme cases they actually shaved themselves to look more like Terrans - an act of rebellion that thoroughly flouted the Clan Way.

It was enough to make her shed to excess. The only thing keeping her from resigning was the simple reality that the thought never entered her mind. She was here to serve the duration of her term, and then the Common House would elect her replacement.

As she rubbed her head, it almost seemed an impossible task. After a few conversations with the Throne, it was apparent that her actual job was to clean out thirty-three generations of carefully built alliances and fiefdoms so that her successor could attune the ministry to the will of all, not simply the nobles. It was a cautious process, with every action or inaction having to be calculated for the effects it would have. Still, it was a maddening situation.

A knock interrupted her thoughts, and she glanced at the door.

""Enter.""

Greatlord Aa'Lafione walked in smoothly. Despite the shame accorded to his family from her sister's actions, he carried an aura cultivated by generations of Ministerial rank. He glanced about with his scent being one of deep agitation mixed with some level of expectancy. ""I require this office.""

""To what purpose?""

""I have issued a challenge to that barbarian Freelord for my daughter. I require this office to send a message and show him what he fights."" He glanced around. ""Despite the lack of authenticity, it still projects the Ministry's authority.""

Larine's mind raced. Acceptance would be a poor choice - almost as poor as refusal. The rumblings of discontent were everywhere and despite recent events, Aa'Lafione's voice still carried weight.

""Initiatives are being planned. I expect your support for those initiatives at the proper time.""

""You shall have it."" The Greatlord's agreement was quick. Far too quick for the Minister's liking. She was going to have to be very careful when calling that favor in.

The Minister stood, donning her robe and chain before pointing at the visitor's couch. ""You may issue your challenge from there.""

""You could expect a greater level of support were the broadcast to be from behind that desk."" The Greatlord's play was obvious.

There was a long pause before the reply was interrupted by a chime from Greatlord's tablet. Aa'Lafione growled in frustration before answering.

""I believe I ordered no interruptions. This is an interruption.""

The image and voice at the other end belonged to a professionally nervous member of the Ministry's Security clan. ""Yes Greatlord. However the."" The adjutant paused. ""The Freelord is on his way to you. He said he preferred to personally answer your challenge.""

Aa'Lafione took a deep breath to roar his frustration at the poor guard when there was a triple-knock at the minister's door, this time from higher up.

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk walked with purpose to the midships shuttlebay to find the armory and security platoons standing in two perfect rows to see him off the ship. Kiole all but exploded her pride as Gryzzk paused in his spur-jingling walk to give the gentlest of touches to the bloodstripes on her uniform pants before he continued on. Collectively the scent of the platoon was a calm pride - they were giving up precious shore leave in order to allow their commander to take care of the clan, and complaining was forbidden.

At least for the first few drinks at the bar.

Gryzzk strapped in and snugged his buckles tightly before wriggling and nodding before slipping a headset on for communication. ""Captain Hoban, proceed to the Ministry of Culture. You may ignore any attempts at guidance from Air Control."" He glanced at the time, feeling a tiny lump of concern at his next sentence before he spoke it. ""You may...indulge yourself as much as the shuttle design allows.""

Hoban's undisguised glee at receiving orders to fly with the only constraint being physics was counterpointed by O'Brien's sour face as she mirrored Gryzzk's movement. ""So glad I've only got coffee in my bloody stomach at the moment.""

The shuttle undocked from the ship and under Hoban's guidance dropped toward the planet as if Vilantia had said unkind things regarding Hoban's parentage. Gryzzk could hear the Air Controller's pleas for Hoban to divert, slow down, or even acknowledge their existence. When Hoban opened the channel to reply, he played something from his personal music collection. Gryzzk was a little concerned about the overall theme of what he'd learned was called Outlaw Country - it seemed to be a song about a man having to answer for the wicked things that he'd done, and then the singer gathered his friends at a saloon, calling for whiskey for his men and beer for the horses. Overall it sounded like a rough form of justice was being encouraged by this particular tune as Hoban sent their shuttle down. Gryzzk activated the internal communications to talk to O'Brien.

""Do Terrans have a song about *everything*?""

""Pretty much, aye."" O'Brien smirked and hefted a silvered cane with a heavy knob that Gryzzk hadn't noticed somehow. ""Just in case someone decides to delay you, sir.""

""I have a different question.""

""What's that, Major?""

""Could you explain what a grizzly is?""

""Soon as you explain why we're not dressed to deliver a homebrewed ass-whipping with a side of fries."" O'Brien's eyebrow lifted questioningly.

Gryzzk looked around awkwardly for a moment. ""It has a great deal to do with the war. The Throne personally returned my Name to me, which means I have their favor to a certain degree. The Greatlord is being cautious with this challenge and heeding to the forms that are more...civilized. Even in a loss, he shows himself to be more distinguished than Tebul and therefore worthy of rank. As a secondary matter, the stakes are lower. The issue at hand is one Clansworn, not the entirety of the Clan.""

""That does explain why a few things. Anyway, a grizzly?"" There was a pause. ""You."" She snickered for a moment. ""Terran animal, big. Like twice the size of the horses we rode back when we were playing Hollywood soldiers. Very cute, but also very protective and bloody violent when threatened. It doesn't hurt that your name kinda sounds like it.""

Gryzzk pondered. ""I...see."" He decided against further questioning as he looked out the viewscreen. ""Captain Hoban, we appear to be approaching Throne City very quickly.""

Hoban gave a half-chuckle. ""That's because...we're going down too quick. Likely crash and kill us all.""

""If that happens, please let me know.""

""Of course, Major. By the way we've been denied permission to land.""

""Then don't land. Hover a safe distance from the ground, and then leave as quickly as possible.""

""That'll be about twenty feet."" Throne city was approaching, and Hoban made several adjustments to avoid traffic and finally slammed to a jarring halt.

In response to their stop, O'Brien slid her beret into a pocket and kicked a floor panel open to reveal lengths of rappelling rope stowed inside, along with several sets of thick gloves designed for rapid descents - essentially they were ablative armor for his hands. Two sets of the gloves were placed on a seat as Gryzzk secured his Stetson to his belt.

The ramp was dropped and ropes deployed, with the two sliding down and landing heavily on the pavement. As soon as they hit the ground, Hoban made rapid ascent and departure. The shuttle engines screamed as the ropes and ramp returned to their original placement.

Gryzzk had never been so close to the Ministry building. It was an edifice of stone and golden edgings, representing the dawn heralded by the ministry's words. The spiral columns rose higher than any building that wasn't the Royal Palace, and over the centuries had become a sprawled monument to the glory of Vilantia.

As Gryzzk took in the architecture, he realized that he and O'Brien were the object of stares. The subject of many pictures. And the primary focus of a security squad hustling up with weapons drawn but not pointed. Their leader was wearing ceremonial armor that may or may not have been useful in a fight, but his scent was confusion and anger over the disruption of the normal island of calm provided by the Ministry.

""You. You are..."" He paused as he realized who he was looking at, and his scent turned into the universal scent of someone who was truly in a situation for which they were unprepared. The fact that their scents mingled with burnt glove-leather and that O'Brien was regarding the security officer with a gaze that would make the deepest stones of the ground flee in terror was not making this poor man's day better. The icing on the cake was that they were being recorded by dozens of personal tablets. This was going to be on the Localgrid rapidly, if it wasn't already.

Gryzzk held a hand up gently. ""Apologies, but I have a time-sensitive appointment with Greatlord Aa'Lafione. I am here to personally answer his challenge at highsun. Would you kindly direct me to his current location?""

There was a moment for communication before the answer came. ""He is in conference with the Minister. Through the foyer and take the Minister's elevator up."" There was a beat. ""The middle one.""

""Excellent. Thank you for your courtesy."" Gryzzk placed his hat on his head properly as he and O'Brien began to move forward toward the Ministry. Before they could take three paces the security squad closed ranks again, with a hesitant gesture at O'Brien's cane.

""We cannot allow you to go before the Minister so armed.""

O'Brien smiled genially, but the smile didn't quite touch her eyes. ""You would not part an old woman from her walking stick."" The words were part question, part statement, and part threat. ""Vilantia causes me pains and I would keep this as an aid.""

There was an exhale and a nod before the squad parted again to allow them entry.

The purple-clad pair strode forward into the ministry with the purpose of a natural disaster, with the metallic song of Gryzzk's spurs keeping the silence from being total. The elevator ride was smooth, with the elevator attendant moving the floor selector to the Minister's floor without being bidden to do so. Her uniform was immaculate but her scent betrayed nervousness the entire time. By long tradition, nobody spoke but they pretended to enjoy the music that was being played as paintings slowly came into view through the gate bars and disappeared as they went ever higher. The paintings and scents associated were some of the finest to ever caress Gryzzk's senses, and all of them served to remind the viewer that the Ministry of Culture touched everything and everyone Vilantian.

Finally the elevator stopped and the gate was opened. There was a moment as Gryzzk saw one of the finest paintings he'd ever seen - an image of the First Throne commanding the First Aa'benie to craft the ministry building here within sight of the palace.

O'Brien flicked her eyes around as she exited first, cane in hand and guarding Gryzzk's personage. When no security arrived to detain them, she huffed softly and nodded, moving forward to the ornate door that read ""Minister Larine"" in gold leaf.

Gryzzk's spurs made echoing jingles as they crossed the expansive foyer to the door proper. The area itself could have easily held the ship's bridge, quarters, and conference room with enough space left over for the dayroom and mess hall. While Gryzzk was overwhelmed, O'Brien was constantly flicking her eyes about for an ambush until they arrived at the front door.

""I better knock, I suppose."" O'Brien's voice held amusement at some inner joke.

""It would be polite to do so, Sergeant Major. We have five minutes."" Gryzzk paused to give O'Brien a very rapid brief. ""The Greatlord will announce the challenge and hit my face with a glove and set a condition. Don't react. I will be expected to return the act and counter the condition with an amendment before presenting one of my own. The one who is most severely shaken by their opponent's There will be three conditions to be decided - the number of Arbiters, the place, and the time.""

O'Brien blinked. ""Okay so why the request to do it over a comm channel?""

""It is good fortune to win the setting of conditions. He could claim victory in all conditions due to my absence and failure to respond properly. Even a disgraced Greatlord is still a Greatlord, and the list of those who have similar authority and would also gainsay him in this is...short.""

""Sleazy.""

""Quite. I will ask you for one of the gloves we used for the ropes."" Gryzzk paused. ""By entering the office, you place yourself with me. You are not required to do so.""

There was the sigh of a long-suffering parent from O'Brien. ""Mad. Noble. Bastard. Someday you'll figure out that Terrans pretty much go as they please and do as they please. And in this moment, it pleases me to be here. Gravity well from hell and all.""

O'Brien took the cane in hand and rapped on the door three times before she opened the door, taking a single step in and another to the right in a perfect chamberlain's movement - it was as if she was heralding the entry of a noble.

""Announcing the entry of Freelord Gryzzk, Major and commander of the companies of the Terran Foreign Legion. Master of the ship *Twilight Rose,* husband to Grezzk and Kiole, father of Nhoot, Gro'zel, Ghabri, and Glaud. Full honors upon request."" The silence and shock of the two inside was enough for Gryzzk to step into the room for another surprise of sorts.

The Minister's office was far from immaculate; his inner Lead Servant immediately began prioritizing and cataloging from a corner while the rest of his consciousness turned from the minister to her guest. The Greatlord was a shining symbol of Vilantian perfection; a suit that mimicked the colors of the dawn with an pool of orange at his feet that slowly morphed to gold of dawn at his collar. At his belt hung a single crisp glove.

""Greatlord Aa'Lafione. I am Freelord Gryzzk, and I would hear your challenge for the right to give commands to one of my Clansworn.""

""I had hoped to spare you the indignity, common one. I suppose your time amongst such coarse assemblage has caused you to forget your place within the Clan Way."" There was a glance at O'Brien. ""The Terran's presence is forbidden. She places herself in matters she knows nothing about.""

O'Brien lifted her right arm and pulled the sleeve back just enough to expose the clan tattoo on her wrist, her scent darkening with grim fury as a withering gaze was locked onto the Greatlord. ""I've fought with the Freelord. Bled for him. Wept with him. My blood, my pain, and my oath carry me where he leads. All these things and more have purchased where I stand. Move me from this spot - if you think yourself capable.""

Neither minister nor Greatlord moved, and after several silent seconds O'Brien covered her wrist and returned to her position, scent calming to one of satisfaction.

Minister Larine spoke softly. ""Her presence is allowed, Greatlord. Issue the challenge in accordance with the Clan Way.""

The Greatlord gathered himself, considering the enormity and realizing that failure was a potential outcome. Still, he was committed, and finally smacked Gryzzk with a glove. ""Arbiter, Lord A'Shanyu.""

For Gryzzk the smack was harsh and painful - not from the physical blow, but because the Greatlord's gloves had been chemically doctored. His nose filled with a charred acid scent, and it was an effort to remain standing. But he finally inhaled and croaked out, ""Sergeant Major, my glove.""

O'Brien passed the weighted leather glove to her commander, who shifted slightly as he'd learned to do during training sessions in the company sand pit. The return smack from the glove in Gryzzk's left hand was efficient, and there was a clattering as something bounced off the wall and skittered to rest at the toe of O'Brien's boot while the rest of the Greatlord was rocked back and took a knee.

Gryzzk made his counter to the shocked scent of the Greatlord. ""Five Arbiters. Lord A'Shanyu, two members of the Common House to be chosen by random lot, the Terran Ambassador to Vilantia, and the Hurdop Ambassador to Vilantia.""

There was no objection from the Greatlord's slowly bleeding mouth, and the minister nodded. ""Five Arbiters, as the Freelord specifies. Location.""

With the second challenge - location, Gryzzk thought rapidly. This was for the commons, so their house would be appropriate. ""House of Commons,"" and a second smack followed, but the Greatlord was prepared for the weight of the glove and moved appropriately so that it didn't daze him as much.

The return caught Gryzzk heavily and he took a knee as he heard ""Vilantianic Stadium."" An ancient place, built on the site of the camp where the First Throne had rested before their final victory in the Great Civilization. It was massive, with seating for tens of thousands. Through the haze, Gryzzk realized that the Greatlord planned to pack the stadium with his clansworn and win by the crowd's cheering or jeering as the situation demanded.

""Vilantianic Stadium. The time.""

The Greatlord's scent was a regained confidence. ""High sun, three days from now."" The third strike from the Greatlord was almost casual, as if he'd already won with the choice of venue.

Gryzzk blinked his tears away before standing calmly. ""Apologies, but I forgot to mention something, Greatlord.""

""What information could you possible have for me?""

""Evening twilight, three days from now. And I. Am not left-handed."" Gryzzk flipped his glove from his left hand to the right, the act allowing him to coil his body slightly and send a dynamic blow exploding across the Greatlord's jaw, causing a second clatter and skitter. This time it was the Greatlord who took a knee.

""Evening twilight, three days from now. You both have your Seconds; the Challenge will take place at Vilantianic Stadium, three days from now at evening twilight. Your efforts will be judged by five Arbiters. May the living gods watch over you both."" There was relief and satisfaction of a sort coming from the minister as she spoke the terms.

O'Brien bent down and retrieved the objects that had skittered and clattered from Gryzzk's harsh blows. ""Greatlord, I would recommend you see a dentist as soon as time allows. With luck, they'll put them back where they were."" She put Greatlord Aa'Lafione's teeth on the Minister's desk where they shone wetly in the reflected sunlight. With that, O'Brien lifted her head to the minister, lowered it slightly as she acknowledged the Greatlord's station, and then opened the door in order to allow Gryzzk and her to leave.

Gryzzk's spurs made the only sound as they proceeded to the elevator. About halfway down, O'Brien finally shook her head.

""Major, once we're at the bar you're going to have to explain how two grown-ass folk slap-fighting is a reasonable way to decide the terms of a challenge.""

""I'm not entirely certain I can explain the why. Only the Way.""

The sergeant-major's grunt was reply enough as they exited the elevator and saw a rather frightening thing - a horde of cameras and microphones from the press, all shouting a cacophony of questions at him through the windows and glass doors of the Ministry entrance. O'Brien's eyes went wide as she surveyed the scene and spoke two words for the both of them.

Hi people, 

Living Rent have been active in Paisley for a while now. You may have seen our most recent community project where we have been working together to try to  get the Fountain Gardens up to a better  standard.

We are having our official Paisley Branch launch tomorrow, in The Wynd Centre, School Wynd, Paisley, 1-3pm. We will have food, tea, coffee and soft drinks available. The event is open to everyone. Children are welcome and we will have a small craft table for them. 

It's a good opportunity to meet other local people, to bring any issues you may have with your housing and find out if we can offer support on it, and/or discuss where you think we should be focusing our next community campaign. 

We will also be electing our first Paisley  committee tomorrow and discussing our activities over the past year. 

We are a member led tenant and community union so if you're free tomorrow and think Living Rent is something you'd like to know more about, please come and join us.

I've been increasingly feeling disillusioned with my current irl friends because it's become that thing of nothing happens if I don't initiate and frankly I'm tired.

I'm looking for people who would like something that's more than just a catch up friendship and have some meaningful friendships again. We can be each other's support class <3

About me:
- Name's Logan (yes, like wolverine)
- South African (GMT +2)
- I am a feral little freak.
- a walking, talking comorbidity.
- I am both chronically online & ill.
- a being made up of health issues and spite.
- low empathy autistic
- Special interests include: cats (the OG), dnd, Guild Wars 2, House MD, witchcraft & astrology, reading, coffee, crafts such as crochet & embroidery, fountain pens & their inks.
- I've collected all the demi identities like my own infinity gauntlet. (Demi-girl (she/they), Demiromantic and Demisexual)
- lesbian with a wife (aka my girlfriend who I call my wife)
- I'm a nonbinary barista stereotype by trade.
- I'm more active on tumblr than any other social media, and most can tell.
- I am your favourite liberal's favourite liberal. Objectively too woke for modern society. If you can think of an issue, assume I've got a liberal stance on it.
- I have 10 cats
- a lot of people tell me their first impressions of me are that I am confident and self assured but what they don't know is that many moons ago on the recommendation of my therapist I started making jokes about being way too smart and/or how amazing I am at something instead of making self deprecating jokes and then accidentally grew an ego. Oops.
- I love writing poetry. I have this vision of writing an anthology of narrative poems based off of one of my own world's from my worldbuilding.
- All of my favourite media are my favourites because of their worldbuilding.
- MASSIVE DROPOUT FAN, brennan lee mulligan my beloved.
- court jester at heart
- as you can probably tell, a yapper
- it's been determined that my fatal flaw is loyalty. I'd let the world burn in favour of helping those I love.

I honestly have high standards for my friendships, so be prepared for that. But I also don't think that I am unreasonable. I don't expect you to be available go talk 24/7 but when we are talking I expect you to put in actual effort and not use chatgpt or whatever ai to talk to me. (Yes, this has happened to me.)

I am not easily an agree to disagree person. If it's trivial things like peanutbutter and jam vs peanutbutter and syrup, I'll happily agree to disagree but I refuse to do that with any of my politics or morals.

Ask me about my job as a barista! I've got latte art pics to share <3 or ask me about my sons' full names (2 kittens named Cosmo and Valerian) or ask me about my views on magic

If I seem intriguing, comment or send me a message!

Please DO NOT message me if you have creepy intentions. I am purely here for friendship.

I am NOT interested in talking to the vast majority of cis men because in my experience on reddit they just want to use me to get off. So just don't.

Send me a üåô if you read everything please. I would also appreciate a little introduction into who you are as a person or why you feel we'd get along well, please.",1,1751035734.0,friendship,3,1.0,False

I feel grateful that the first time I saw this film was in 2021, a year before it shocked many by pushing [*Citizen Kane*](https://basilfilm.wordpress.com/2024/09/21/discussion-314-citizen-kane-1941/) and *Vertigo* out of the way to become the #1 film on the prestigious *Sight and Sound* list. Without such a massive reputation, I had fewer expectations going in, except that posters on the *1001 Movies* subreddit would commonly complain that it was a boring film that mainly consisted of a woman peeling potatoes. It‚Äôs so much more than that.

Indeed, I don‚Äôt think any other film has kept me on the edge of my seat for a full three hours. This is a piece of performance art where everyday chores are the main spectacle, and exposition is scant. Only half an hour into the film does the protagonist read a letter from her sister in Canada, giving us morsels of information about Jeanne on which to base our hypotheses. Her awkward son, Sylvain, barely speaks, but when he does, he reveals volumes about their strange familial relationship. In these moments I‚Äôm craning to glean any knowledge I can, which might explain why Jeanne behaves so unusually.

She‚Äôs a woman of fastidious cleanliness and organisation; she always keeps herself busy and, in the first half of the film at least, never lets anything bother her or get in her way. We note that the film takes place over roughly 50 hours, beginning right before one of her gentleman visitors on a Tuesday, and ending right after another on Thursday. On my first watch, I had not noticed that she was a sex worker until the second day, as the film makes no explicit reference as to why these men enter her home, leaving me a bit clueless as to the context for half of the movie. In the TCM intro, however, Alicia Malone made it very explicit, as do most other synopses around the Web (Google even spoils the ending!). On the Wednesday, she emerges from her sex work with her hair unusually messy, and does not seem like her usual, organised self, though she attempts to continue. We‚Äôre forced to guess as to why this encounter has bothered her so; my personal hypothesis is that the letter from her sister forced her to consider her unhappy marriage to her late husband and whether to marry again, which prevented her from engaging in sex work in the emotionless way she‚Äôs used to.

This causes her to visibly spiral, as she forgets to take the potatoes off the boil before washing herself, causing them to be spoiled. I remember being gleeful as I successfully guessed that we would then have to go to the shops with her to buy more potatoes, just one of the ways that Akerman uses the passage of time to show what kind of burdens are placed on women in traditional roles.

On the Thursday, things go even worse, and we notice deviations in her normal preparations, such as dropping the shoe brush or trying to dry a plate before all the suds have been washed off. Far from being boring chores, these performances draw us into the very detail of what she‚Äôs doing to try to analyse her psyche. In one of the harshest scenes, we see her enter her favourite caf√© for a coffee, only to find her favourite seat has been taken by an older woman who sits in the centre of the frame, forcing Jeanne to not even be front and centre in her own film. To make matters worse, her favourite server has also clocked out for the day, and her experience is ruined.

I believe that Akerman wanted to show the plight or oppression of women with this feminist flick, but I can‚Äôt help noticing how much her central character oppresses herself by refusing to engage in anything enjoyable throughout her day. She doesn‚Äôt listen to the radio while she cleans or cooks, nor does she find the time to do anything else that is just for herself. She even forces her son to be miserable by not letting him read at the dinner table. It‚Äôs revealed that she wasn‚Äôt really in love with her husband, but just married him because it felt like the right thing to do. One wonders if she‚Äôs ever chosen to put herself first ever. You would think, without her husband present, she would be free to do whatever she wanted; instead, Akerman stated in an interview that Jeanne lives exactly as she did before he died. As incredible as this film is, I do feel that it hasn‚Äôt aged so well, purely because feminism *has* caught on to the point where most Western women would not be satisfied to be mindless chore automatons. I think Akerman‚Äôs film may reflect a category of women that were more common in the past, and I suppose that is fascinating in a way. Akerman also pointed out that she had actress Delphine Seyrig in mind as she was completely the opposite of that sort of woman, and she thought Seyrig would make the ‚Äòinvisible woman‚Äô more visible.

Let‚Äôs talk about the ending, if you‚Äôre okay with spoilers. On my first watch, I didn‚Äôt think the murder seemed like something that this timid, fastidious person would engage in, and it felt like an unrealistic ending to what had otherwise been a realistic portrait of a traditional woman. On my second watch, however, knowing the ending was coming, I became more satisfied with the interpretation that the anxiety within Jeanne had been building for decades, rather than just 24 hours, and that the idea of a woman snapping and murdering a male oppressor was more of a metaphor anyway for what could happen.

The final, five-minute shot of a blood-soaked Jeanne sitting in silence as the familiar blinking neon lights make patterns on the wall behind her also felt unsatisfying the first time around, as if Akerman wanted to just waste a bit more of people‚Äôs time before letting them leave. It seemed that if it had ended with a ring at the doorbell or her son Sylvain walking into the scene, we‚Äôd have a more powerful ending. But perhaps Akerman was aware that audiences *would* be seeking that thrill and drama, which is clearly the opposite of the film she was trying to make. Withholding that exciting moment from the audience and instead making them come to their own conclusions is the final power play by the young Akerman, only 25 when she directed this masterpiece.

I presented this film to my Film Club this week as it had been a dream of mine to persuade people to sit through all 200 minutes of this film and force them to watch ‚Äòabsolute cinema‚Äô. I feared that everyone else would find it completely dull and leave, but watching *Jeanne Dielman* turned into an extremely fun group exercise as we all spoke throughout about the details that we noticed. I started to cackle with glee when some members realised from her reactions after her second client that she was starting to lose it; they were experiencing the same thing I was the first time around. Ironically, the member who disliked the film most and fell asleep for half of it correctly guessed the ending when he said, ‚ÄúI would absolutely love it if she stabbed him in the chest with those scissors right now.‚Äù After Dielman obliged, he exclaimed, ‚ÄúBest film ever! I‚Äôll watch it every week.‚Äù

Delphine Seyrig might have been typecast as the type to appear in slow-moving, ambiguous films, as she also appeared in [*India Song*](https://basilfilm.wordpress.com/2023/01/03/discussion-209-india-song-1975/) in the same year as this film, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the most obnoxiously boring things I‚Äôve ever sat through (ironically, Marguerite Duras called Akerman crazy in the theatre when her film was premiered). Many will probably say the same about *Jeanne Dielman*, but I am one of those who sees it as a phenomenal masterpiece, and worthy of its new placement on the *Sight and Sound* list, even if it isn‚Äôt quite as relevant today. It‚Äôs an extreme film that expects a lot from its audience, but if you put in the work and are open to making a lot of your own hypotheses, *Jeanne Dielman* is a richly rewarding and unique experience that uses time as a tool to help you feel empathy for someone quite different from yourself. You‚Äôll never forget it.

My wife and I have only been together for a bit over 2 years now, both 25. 

I love her more than I've ever loved anything before. She always makes me laugh and we are in sync about so many things. 

Recently we've been having problems. She has been having a ton of anxiety about my family and friends and even neighborhood, as she's a new immigrant to the country and has been here for 3 months. She finds everybody to be 'fake' around here, always acting nice but then doing actions that show they don't actually like/respect you. These thoughts are coming from her work AND my parents. Her work I believe, because every story she's told me does sound like her co workers are just some snotty brats in adult bodies. Even though it sucks for us financially, I told her it's fine if she quits as I care more about her mental health than anything else. So she did.

For extra context, we currently live in my parents house (I know, dick move on my part making my wife love with my parents for a few months. I only expected to be here for a few months to build some finances, then to rent someehere for just us.

So now my wife says she wants to be moved out of my parents house by the start of next week. She claims she's getting so much anxiety from being around them that she can't spend any more time here or she will probably ""kill herself or kill them"". I know you might read that in a joking way, but I promise you she says it in the most serious and angry way possible, then follows it with ""I'm completely serious, I can't deal with them anymore"". My parents definitely aren't perfect, as we have had some issues with them not respecting our privacy to the extent we would like, but they've never treated her in any harmful way right to get face. 

This isn't me invalidating her feelings, at least I don't want to. But even though I do find her demands to be a little brash, I told her fine that we can move out as soon as we find a place. But no, she NEEDS it to be Monday or Tuesday of next week, even if we have to stay at an AirBNB. Fine, sure. I just want her to have good mental health, and if it's my family causing the issues, it's my responsibility as her husband to protect her from that. 

But currently she's telling me she NEVER, EVER wants to come visit my parents again. She told me I could call with them if I wanted, but she doesn't even want to talk with them. I asked her if we move far away, could I come to visit them by myself. She said sure, but if we have kids at the time, I can't bring them and that it's a dick move of me to leave her with them alone. 

This is making my feel like I'm making the wrong choice. I know when you get married, you are therefore choosing your wife as your new family, making her the priority in life. But does that mean I should have to abandon my parents for probably years? 

I'm saving this part for last as it's pretty much the dealbreaker. She hits me. Yesterday when I was driving the car, she grabbed my hair, pulled me closer to her, and started hitting the top of my head really hard. WHILE I WAS DRIVING. Then when we were home, she slapped me across the face. Also, if I shit any doors between me and her trying to get some space, she came and literally kicked them open, even hitting one I locked with a chair. 

She also insults me almost daily, the most common one being calling me a pussy, usually for not ""standing up"" to my parents on her behalf. Yet I have done this multiple times, communicating with them what makes her and I uncomfortable, which they agreed to work on. But my wife's idea of standing up seems to only be to go up and start a yelling match with them. 

Yesterday was definitely the worst she's ever been, as she also took all of my clothes out of the closet and threw them on the floor. She grabbed my wallet, saying since she bought it for me she could do whatever she wanted with it, and started literally ripping 50 dollar bills in half and bending all of my credit and debit cards. She also ripped in half the picture I have of her in my wallet. And I forgot to mention that the past month or so she has dumped coffee/soda on me while I'm driving.

So yea, I'm just a bitch who can't find the balls to leave someone who is obviously abusive to me. She obviously has no respect for me, as some of these have been issues for a long time in our relationship. 

I don't want to make it seem like I don't care about her problems, as I'm sure she probably does feel that my parents somehow are against her personally, but I feel like I know them better than that, and she just won't listen to my opinion about it without just saying ""You're wrong.""

Anyway, we almost split up last night, but I felt like I was gonna die with how sad I was. She was obviously sad too, crying that she doesn't want the marriage to end but that she sees no other options. So we sort of made up, but today I'm just feeling like a weakling for not being able to make any kind of solid choice.

I had been single for six months and really wanted to get back into dating. So, two month ago, I pulled the trigger and made a Hinge, and Tinder account. Btw I'm a 20 year old Male.

To my surprise, I do actually get matches quite regularly (3-4 a week). And I would say I vibe with about half of them.

We would talk and talk and get to know each other! (on a surface level of course). But I'm the type of dude who prefers chatting irl way more than texting. So, when I feel like we've connected quite a bit (often about after a week of chatting), I shoot my shot, and ask her out for a coffee. And very often my matches say yes! even being enthusiastic about it. It's just that they'll have to check the calendar, check their work schedule, or we actually set up a date but later on they cancel, etc.

Now here comes the cursed bit, so far, not one of my matches have ever follow through, either they go cold, ghost, or we could still be talking, but if I bring up our potential date, and ask if they have a day soon that they're available, they would always talk around it, or... just ignore it.

Just now, it happened again. I'm pretty sure this is like the tenth time this has happened. And, it is kind of demotivating. Going through the loop of having genuine romantic interest in a person but, never being able to go a step further.

So, a string of bad luck? Or could it be because of my behaviour? 

I guess, what I would like to know: Is this common? If you have said yes to a date before but haven't followed through, could you share why? Or have you experienced something similar? If so, do you have advice? 

Or just, any advice really, all of it is welcome!

2. The morning kitchen rush with kids, coffee, and getting ready for school and work 

3. Catching up with the girls over brunch to humble brag and compare lifestyles

4. Having your designated person with whom to grow old 

5. Cute anniversary dates and gifts

6. The ""how did you guys meet?"" stories 

7. Holidays with the big happy family from both sides 

Etc

All of that is in the garbage as you are now a divorcee. Back in the dating pool having to sift through fuckbois, predators, cheaters, ""alpha"" tater tots, and man-children with waifu body pillows, woke fishing scammers, and porn addled inkwells.

I met them a few times in our shared hobby and they were very nice and polite during that and after. The problem is that I later found out that both of them are basically as far right as it gets and I am not exaggerating. They are both part of (like running for office part of) my countrys most far-right party, proclaim themselves to be openly facists anf their social medias are full of horrible stuff about immigrants, LGBT+ community and other minorities. I myself am trans, I am very sensitive about these issues in general and I just feel so disgusted by the things those two post. They were never bad to my face, but it's not like they knew anything about me. I told my friend I would prefer not to meet them ever again and she has respected my wishes on that. She herself is a great person, does volunteering, is part of the LGBT+ community herself, and is very left leaning in her politics.

But it bothers me how close she is to these people. It bothers me that she and her fianc√© spend so much time with people who openly wish folks like my fianc√© and I wouldn't exist. It bothers me how she can march at pride one day and the next have coffee with people who march against human rights, how she feels open distain against other far-right people and politicians, but not the two that, to be honest, have said so much worse. I admit, I am also autistic, so maybe it's just my black and white thinking, but I just cannot undestand my friend. My heart breaks just a little bit whenever we hang out and she mentions in passing that they have bigger plans with the other couple. I know I just need to bring it up with her, but I am so afraid of losing her as a friend. I am so afraid she'll rather choose the people who hate me. And I fear that I am the unreasonable one, the intolerant one.

So, am I overreacting to all of this? Should I just ignore the friends of my friend or should I bring this up with her?",1,1751035154.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

I kept seeing the same guy come in, he was definitely the biggest guy I had seen there.  He didn't really talk to anyone, just came in, did some ridiculous weightlifting and left after an hour.  I had told my friends about him and they pushed me to ask him out since it was clear I was getting distracted and should just get it over with.

Well I went through with it about a week ago and approached him while he was cleaning up after a set, the first time I had ever done something like that, and asked him I've always wanted to get to know him and if he wanted to go get some coffee afterwards.  He said he was extremely flattered but he's married with kids, and turns out he's twice my age (I'm 22 he's 41, and does not look like it).  So of course we did the whole awkward laugh and wave goodbye thing but now I feel so embarrassed and too anxious to go to the gym, I've missed this whole week.

1llvfxg,https://i.redd.it/n9wz19m57h9f1.png,New UW Station Upgrades,"Hey y'all! 

I‚Äôm a UW student and I sit on the Grand River Accessibility Advisory Committee (GRAAC) at the Region. There was a recent presentation about some planned changes at uWaterloo Station, mostly upgrades like adding new railings in a few spots. Just wanted to flag it here in case you hadn‚Äôt heard!

One of the proposed changes is **adding railings between the station platform and the train tracks**, *which I totally get*... it helps keep people from getting too close, and I‚Äôve definitely seen the train honk at folks who are right on the edge.

But the other railings? *I‚Äôm honestly not a fan*. There are **railings planned between the sidewalk and the bus-only entrance**, and it seems like it might serve to bottleneck the crowd and get in the way. I‚Äôm not convinced the safety gain is significant enough to justify the restriction in how people move through the space.

In a way, it shows how convenience is also accessibility. If it‚Äôs harder to move through a space, that affects a lot of people: folks with mobility aids, sure, but also anyone holding their backpack, carrying their coffee, rushing between their classes, or pushing strollers around campus.

Anyway, I'm curious what others think. Do the railings seem helpful to you? Unnecessary?

If you have concerns or feedback, you can [email the Supervisor of Transit Development here](mailto:schang@regionofwaterloo.ca) to share your opinions!

Cheers, 

**Friday Saleh** (they/them)

I originally was hospitalized for an OD after an attempt, so it‚Äôs been a bit hard to acclimate myself to society.

I can‚Äôt get a job due to me going to residential soon, and am terrified of going back to school.

I have a great support circle, have four tight knit friends, and prefer to go out by myself like to galleries or walking around the city for a coffee. I have hobbies such as clay, journaling, crosswords, and writing. I do see my friends at least once a week, so I don‚Äôt understand why I feel so depressed once more. I end up scrolling on my phone because doing anything else puts me in a state of panic. 

I did an assessment for PHP, but was referred to do residential due to my results. Should I do residential? I‚Äôm just so tired of feeling this way, even on meds, I want to be normal and not worry about what I‚Äôm doing all day, terrified of wasting my life.

1llvdrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApprenticeshipsUK/comments/1llvdrz/am_i_being_delusional_on_how_much_i_should_be/,"Am I being delusional on how much I should be paid. I feel like I'm being shafted by my employer, being overworked and underpaid.","This is a long one, but I will really appreciate any feedback or opinions on my situation. Theres a TLDR at the end. 

I'm a CNC Machinist apprentice, 19 years old on my 2nd year. I just completed my HNC in manufacturing engineering with distinctions all round except a pass on one assignmentüòî. 

If you look through my profile I made a post on the r/machinists subreddit asking how much my experience and skills are worth, I diddnt mention that I was an apprentice however they seem to think my skills are worth significantly more than I'm being paid and a couple made comments on how I should look for another job. If you are unfamiliar with what a CNC Machinist does then please read that post and have a flick through the subreddit.

A quick summary of that post is that I work sometimes more than 50 hours a week manufacturing precision components. I've been trusted to manufacture parts for our largest customers and I very rarely make mistakes or produce bad parts. I work as early as 6am and as late as 10pm, after that I get anxiety about making mistakes and the stress sometimes prevents me from sleeping or socialising. 

I've taken a week off work citing burnout as the reason. We are extremely busy this time of the year so I had to fight to get time off on short notice. I took holiday instead of sick pay too. I was dragged into the main office after mentioning that I was unhappy, and given a lecture about how I'm being paid because of my skill and not that I'm an apprentice. This is a lie because If I weren't an apprentice and instead I was a normal employee I would be getting paid less than minimum wage. 

I've asked for more money twice in the last week but after my meeting it's clear they don't plan on increasing it. 

Ive had no formal or long-lasting training in the last 8 months and instead I've even been put in charge of training other apprentices or even new employees. Before that I only received training when I spoke out and complained about my lack of training. During my meeting I was promised training in the next couple months however I've heard it all before. 

I'm speaking to my college contact after I get back from my week off, my current wage is ¬£12 an hour (¬£13.50 with my shift allowance) and right now I'm sick of being lied to by my company. 

I feel undervalued and overworked especially for my age. I feel like my skills are being exploited and i feel like quiting the apprenticeship and leaving the company. 

Am I being delusional? I feel like I work extremely hard and I should be paid well for it. I'm making less than friends who work in Asda yet I have a level 4 qualification and I work in a skilled trade.

My plan is to demand ¬£15 an hour or I leave, is this too aggressive? Am I being delusional? I'm at the end of my patience with my employer now and I just don't know what to do. I love my job and most of the people who work there are always happy to teach me new skills or buy me coffee/listen to me ramble. This post makes it sound like I'm working for a 1800s slave driver but actually I really enjoy my job most of the time. I don't want to leave this place on a bad note and I diddnt plan on leaving for at least a couple of years. These last couple of weeks have just been really abrasive and I don't feel like I can continue especially for how little I'm paid. 

Let me know any thoughts you have about my situation, again any feedback would be amazing, I just don't know that to do. 

TLDR:
I feel undervalued and overworked by my employer. I'm doing the job of a fully qualified CNC Machinist while being paid less than a 18 year old Asda worker. I've only ever had training when I complained about my lack of training and I feel like quiting the apprenticeship and leaving. What would you do?

1llvc0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1llvc0q/wife_cheated_with_coworker_then_fell_in_love_with/,Wife Cheated with Coworker... then fell in love with him.,"Okay y'all, buckle up, this one is crazy! Okay, so it all started on New Years Eve this year, when I (38M) was on vacation with our two daughters (3 and 7) visiting my family over the Christmas and New Year break. We were having a good trip and everything was normal until on NYE day, I called my wife (34F) to check in and let the girls say hi.  She was supposed to be off work by then since she opened, and that is when it all started falling apart.  I could tell in the background noise that she was not at her store because it was dead quiet and she was telling me that they were fixing something with a contractor.  Mind you, she works retail so of course on holidays they do not have scheduled maintenance, because it is all sales focused.  So I could tell something was off, but I did not say anything, and just let the girls talk to her and tell her about what we had been doing that day.  She then told me she was planning on hanging out with some people from work in the parking lot until midnight (mind you this was probably around 3 pm and it was very cold outside) so that rubbed me wrong.

  
Later that evening, maybe around 9pm, I figured we would call since we were in different time zones and say Happy New Year so I could get the girls to bed.  I tried calling and it went straight to voice mail, then I texted and the messages did not go through.  So needless to say, I actually started to get a little worried because if she truly was just outside then I did not know what could have happened.  I first though about calling the police to have them just drive by and make sure they were okay (probably drastic I know, and I didn't end up doing that) but I did text her mom and sister because they all shared locations with each other on the iPhone.  Her sister said she also couldn't get ahold of her and that her phone was in the next city over at a house. I started to worry more, and then remembered that she had let my daughters take her iPad with us on the trip so they could watch the movies in the car, and I checked it where she had her messages synced up.  That was where I found out that she had actually had a text thread with a guy she works with (28M, yes, younger guy) over the past few days planning what they wanted to do for NYE and how they wanted to hang out.  She was talking to him about doing things that she told me she hated, like going to watch the fire works or going to a bar where the women dress down and she had all kinds of suggestions and excitement in her messages.  By this point, her phone was still off, I had sent tons of messages and tried to get ahold of her, and just decided to delete them, and I found her location on her iPad.  

  
I then decided that after I had seen her get home around 3 or 4 am, I still had not slept, I took his number and texted him, pretending to be a random person and try to get him to admit to doing anything with her, which he did not admit to anything.  The next morning, she called me and started telling me she was mad that I had sent him all the messages, and the second I told her what I knew the tables had turned and she tried being defensive.  She told me there were a bunch of the managers there and it wasn't just him and her and they didn't do anything.  We were still a few days from coming home, so I could not do anything about it anyway, so I let it go, thinking it was a one time thing and nothing more came of it.  Of course this led to lots of fights, and I got very mad but I am ex military so I have restrain and would never hurt her, however she told me that he was scared of me because of my past.  When I got home, we had talked a little and tried getting over it, but of course her story had all kinds of holes in it.  On the 6th, I was at work and not able to focus of course, so I was getting upset and wanted to prove to her that I knew more than she would be willing to admit, so I went at lunch time to try to go get the receipts from Chilis because she said she didn't get food there, but I knew she picked up the food, so I just assumed he ordered it and I wanted to see that it was for only two people rather than a bunch of people, and of course when I asked for the names of the others at the party she did not say anything.  She said she didn't trust me to not confront them, and that is fair enough, but I still knew she was lying.  So on my drive up, to Chilis, I changed my mind, and decided it would be better to just go and see her at work and ask her to go to lunch with me so we could talk more.  When getting to her store, I did not see her car in the parking lot, and at first thought she just went out for food herself, but then realized that he did not live far from there, so I decided to drive to where I saw on her location on NYE, and sure enough, when I got there, her car was in his driveway.  I tried calling and texting her and of course she ignored me.  So I took off my ring and put it on the hood of her car, sent her a picture and told her she could give it to him.

  
That seemed to get her attention and she started texting but would not call.  I told her to video chat me right that second if there was nothing going on, and of course she didn't.  Later that night, she said she just wanted to take him coffee and smooth things over because she still had to work with him and she felt bad for what I said to him and for me trying to trick him.  Needless to say, she never came into the bed that night and waited for me to leave the next morning to change and get her shower.  She slept on the couch and told me she was just too tired to even get up even though I woke her up three different times, before and after putting the girls to bed, and then one more time when I was going to bed.  Ironic part of the story, when I was at the house, I saw his cat (yes, single young guy has a cat) sitting in the window, which I am allergic to.  So later the next day when I got home, I was in the closet getting my cloths for a shower, and started sneezing and my allergies started acting up.  At first I though nothing of it, but then as I was walking out, I saw her laundry basket and put it together.  I pulled out her pants from in the basket and there was a bunch of cat hair on the inside of the legs.  As if he ripped them off her and just tossed them on the floor.  Then I started looking at her shirt, also with cat hair, and then on the back there was what most men would know as a semen stain.  So I took the shirt and told her what I found and her underwear too, and told her I was gonna have it tested, but still haven't.  Even though I still have the shirt to this day.  I know she has seen him on and off since this has happened.  I have seen some of her messages to him and heard some of the conversations that she had with him or her family, things she has said about me that hurt like hell.  I know what I need to do.  I have already started the paperwork and stuff with a lawyer, but I am so alone.  I know when she goes to his house to hook up.  Just yesterday she was there again and then she comes home and pretends like nothing happened.  I know my oldest daughter can sense something is off.  I gave her about 5 months of trying to convince her to stop and ""come home"" and keep the family together.  Heck, I even gave her the option of being a hot-wife and hooking up with him but just asked that she be honest with me, but she still to this day thinks her relationship with him is a secret, but I know more than she has any idea about.

  
I am tired.  I am lonely.  I have already essentially started acting as a single parent with my daughters.  I will be honest, I have some very twisted and angry thoughts at times, stuff I want to do to him, or maybe tell her boss about their affair after the divorce is finalized.  I don't know, I don't really even know what to expect from posting here, I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest.  If any of you want more details, feel free to ask.  I just wanted to vent and honestly any advice or comments could probably help me out a lot!  I am currently in the mindset that because of her I don't trust people any more.  Because of him, I have extreme desires of rage and things I want to do, but of course I will not act on them as my girls need me, and to be honest, they are the only two people in this world that have kept me grounded this long.  Thanks for reading this chaos, and I hope you are all having better days, weeks, months and even this entire 2025 than I am!  Thanks again for reading!",19,1751034594.0,Infidelity,63,0.79,False

I started at 2.125.  Zero side effects. also zero weight loss, which my doc says is pretty normal while still getting used to the medicine.  I met with Doctor between weeks 3-4 and he upped my dose. I do the injection on Saturday.  My plan was to do the final injection at 2.125 on Saturday and then the following week go up to the new dose, 4.25.  I did a boneheaded thing and ended up with my final lower dose running down my arm, (Its a stupid story and I know better, but it happened) so missed that shot.  The pharmacy was closed for the weekend, so I just skipped the shot.

  After back and forth emails with pharmacy on Monday, I finally was able to do injection Tuesday morning, which was 10 days since my previous shot.   I did the new dose, 4.25,  first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.  Then I had coffee and a protein drink and went to meet a friend for tea.  At about 11:00 I started feeling nauseous.  At first it just felt like I needed to burp and uncomfortable like I‚Äôd eaten too much.  By the time I got home, I felt really unwell and barely made it into the house before I threw up.  I still hadn‚Äôt eaten anything because I felt so awful.  I kept throwing up after that, so didn‚Äôt eat anything.  the next morning was the same, so the doctor called in Zofran for me, which helped a little. I still couldn‚Äôt eat and could only drink a mouthful of water at a time without throwing up.  

Day three was yesterday, I was finally  able to eat a little bit, but not even close to what I needed for the day.  I think I got 400 calories in yesterday.  

I‚Äôm trying to figure out what was the thing that tipped me into three days of being sick.

\* Was it because it had been too long between shots (10 days) so I had no ‚Äútolerance‚Äú from the lower dose' so it was like starting over at too high of a dose?

\* Should  I have eaten before the dose?

  
\* Going forward, should I split the new dose and do two 2.125 every 3.5 days?

  
Sorry so long, I just wanted to provide all the facts.

*8:00-08:30am (wake up before coffee)* **3 drops/0.15ml (\~600mcg slu-pp-332)**  
*11:00 (after coffee)* **2 more drops/0.10ml (\~400mcg slu-pp-332)**  
*3:00pm-ish (1.5hr after lunch)* **2 drops/0.10ml (\~400mcg slu-pp-332)**

So we are both taking 1400mcg (1.4mg) each day. Each 10ml bottle has 40mg so that's almost 30 days - which is amazing. My friend thought it was a whole ""droplet"" (the whole glass tube), but don't do that. Imagine a raindrop has 200mcg and mix 2 of those in a tiny bit of water, like in a shotglass.

I moved on from powders to **slu-pp-332 liquid drops** and the results are night/day! I'll be on this forum just to follow your progress and share our own!

Oh, and btw... thankfully I didn't touch ozempic. Talk soon!",16,1751034219.0,SLUPP332,5,1.0,False

But today, Friday, when I wanted to launch the game, Xbox gave me the option to load the save from the cloud or from the drive. I chose the cloud, only to be surprised that I had lost my progress and the summer event I had completed was no longer there, as if I hadn‚Äôt played at all on Thursday.""
