Time consuming considerations [500€-800€],"I’ve been looking through subreddits for information to help me decide, but I keep running into the same general questions and answers about these machines, without many deeper considerations. So far, it’s become fairly clear to me that most people prefer a Bambino Plus paired with a separate grinder (usually recommending the Smart Grinder Pro or the DF54), mainly due to the poor grinder on the Barista Express and the faster heat-up time of the Bambino.

Here are some other considerations that matter a lot to me and that I haven’t been able to find clear answers for in the forums:

Although I enjoy the process of making espresso, most of the time I’m in a hurry and can’t spend 5–10 minutes per coffee, so overall speed is very important to me — not just machine warm-up time, but especially the preparation itself (grinding, weighing, transferring to the basket, and closely monitoring the extraction to stop it at the right moment). In my day-to-day work routine, I often end up using a regular Nespresso simply because I can insert a capsule, press a button, and go do other things while it heats up and pulls the shot.

I also frequently have guests who enjoy coffee, and it’s not practical for me to make four shots if the process takes 5–10 minutes per drink. For example, it’s unclear to me whether both machines accept baskets capable of pulling two decent shots at the same time, or whether the grinders — built-in or separate — allow you to load all the beans you plan to use at once, or if you’re forced to dose one shot at a time. For instance, I think I read in another post that the DF54 doesn’t have hopper capacity for more than a single shot per grind cycle.

Taking into account that I live in Spain, that I usually drink both espresso and lattes, and that I’m quite a beginner in the world of espresso, could you give me some guidance considering these considerations?

Budget not a problem in these range os machines \[500€-800€\]

While browsing around, I ended up coming across one of those smart coffee tables, you know, the ones with the lift-top, charging ports, and the little built in storage sections. I hadn’t really thought about owning anything smart besides my phone and tv, but it actually seemed pretty cool .


The thing is, I’m not totally sold on the idea, I've seen a bunch online and some of them look nice but they remind me of those listings on Alibaba where you can't really tell how sturdy something actually is until it shows up. The smart table I saw in store looked decent, though, and I liked that it didn’t look overly futuristic or out of place.

I mainly drink coffee in the living room before work, and I usually have my laptop or notebook nearby, so a lift top table actually makes sense. But I’m trying to stay practical and not buy somethingI won’t use. I’ve also been trying to keep my decor simple,  neutral couch, clean lines, nothing too flashy, so I’m wondering if adding something like this would throw the room off.

For anyone here who owns a smart coffee table (or has tried one):

Does the smart table last long term?

Is the lift top solid and stable enough for everyday use?

1q97yh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q97yh8/90_days_the_fog_is_lifting/,90 Days - The fog is lifting,"There is not a day that goes by where I do not reflect on this little corner of the internet and what it has meant to me.  I read almost every post and each time I am deeply thankful for the sense of community and encouragement here. 

Thank you to everyone out there from the bottom of my heart. 

90 days was the original stretch goal when I set out to do this.  I'm now going for 180.  Here are some thoughts:

* I had 100's of day 1s.  The first breakthrough was a Dry Jan a few years ago.  Each length of being sober, no matter how small, matters.  
* During stretches of attempting to be sober, I always kept a journal.  It is cruel, unjust and down right evil how my mind would constantly try apply some sort of twisted bias on how wonderful being drunk could be and how much I was missing by being sober. 
* I accounted for every small change I could notice during my attempts and wrote them down.  I literally had to read that top to bottom each time I was tempted to drink as a reminder that my mind was somehow blocking.
* I used to smoke 15 yrs ago.  While smoking, I could not imagine ever getting up and having a coffee without a smoke.  Same thing with drinking.  I was terrified about losing my Sunday nights watching the game and drinking.  4-6 beers every day.  Benders.  Bottle of wine and 2 DIPAs. After 90 days, I can 100% say I no longer think like this.  Its unreal to me that this is possible.  

This entire stretch of 90 has become an exercise in finding ways to fill the dopamine crush I used to get from drinking.  To me, 10 drinks and a night out with a fireplace and maybe some darts hits a dopamine score of 100.  Its damn near perfect....up until the morning where it goes to -100 dopamine, regret, pain in my stomach and ribs, swollen ankles and exhaustion. 

I have come to realize I will never again score a 100 in my life.  However, for me, this is how I'm slowly making the progress towards feeling alive without alcohol (and their related scores on what they mean to me):

* Falling asleep in minutes (15)
* Fat wallet (10)
* Weight loss (8)
* Sex drive (7)
* Staying calm in moments of crises (5)
* Not being winded from climbing stairs (5)
* Clear competitive thoughts and connecting the dots at work (5)
* Desserts ( 3)
* Remembering my dreams - which are not as violent as before (2)
* Driving at night with zero stress (2)
* Fitting into old clothes (2)
* NA Beers (1)

I want to say again to this group : you all mean the world to me.  I honestly feel for the first time in my life that I will live longer and be able to watch my kids get married or have kids.  You all have given me the gift of life. ",4,1768061395.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

1q97ptm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1q97ptm/was_the_behavior_of_this_colleague_and_her/,Was the behavior of this colleague and her husband normal? Asvices plz,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

Not sure where to begin with this. I wasn't even sure what I was looking for, at first. It took some digging but this post was forwarded around enough that it got my attention. I recognize the story, the writing style and how you speak about the forest. 

I found your post Ethan. 

I have all of you to thank here, actually. We recovered Ethan's phone at the scene, screen cracked but still working. I had been waiting for the warrant to take its sweet time to come through when the notifications kept pinging on the lock screen. 

I checked into the logo where the messages were coming from, and I found this site. I'm not really on social media at all, but made my own account anyway so I can keep tabs on here. 

He'd been missing for 36 hours when I found the post. I've read it about ten times before I finally accepted it for what it is. Not a piece of creative writing, but a record. Some comments here claim this is a joke, or some hoax. 

I wish that were true. 

If you’re reading this and you’ve already read his entry, then you understand why I’m adding to it. If he’s alive, this might be the only place I can reach him. 

And if he isn’t.. 

Then I will make sure it wasn't for nothing. 

I went back to the campsite this morning.
It had already been logged, photographed, cleared of the obvious. That didn’t mean it was finished. It just meant no one else thought there was more to see. 

Ethan was careful. I knew that before ever laying eyes on the scene. He didn’t leave trash behind. He didn’t lose gear. He set up carefully with purpose. What I found didn’t match that. 

The fire pit had been kicked apart. Not in an attempt to snuff out warm coals. like someone kicked into it hard and fast without caring where their foot landed. The half burnt logs lay scattered out from the side of the broken ring of stones. 

His tent was the same. The poles had been broken, the fabric folded in on itself, like it had collapsed under a heavy weight. No gashes or large tears. 

There was one thing that stuck out. A single spent casing, half-buried under some leaves mere feet from the fire ring. I recognized the caliber immediately. So did the lab. A single 30 caliber shell. Typical for big game. 

However, there was no impact site found. That was what bothered me. 

No tree strike. No ground penetration. No ricochets. I double checked anyway. 

My partner, Paul Reddick, had been transferred to me two months ago. Narcotics, then violent crimes. Good clearance rate. Good instincts, as long as the problem looked like something he’d seen before. He came to inspect the scene with me and see for himself just what these cases are like out here. 

“Could’ve panicked,” Paul said behind me. 

He hadn’t crouched. He was still standing near the tent, hands on his belt, eyes scanning for shapes instead of details. “Fired once. Missed. Took off.” He nudged the tent with his shoe ""Fell into his tent on the way out."" 

I didn’t respond. I was tracing the casing’s position relative to the fire pit, the tent, the disturbed ground. 

“People do weird things under stress,” he added. 

That was the problem. Ethan didn’t. 

If he’d fired at a person, it would’ve been closer to the tent. If he’d fired at an animal, there would’ve been damage, hit or miss. Even a warning shot leaves a trace. 

The casing told me when the shot was fired. The fire pit told me how the camp was disrupted. The tent told me how fast it happened. All signs pointed to a struggle. None of it told me where the bullet went. 

“Look,” he said, finally crouching beside me. “No blood, no drag marks, no signs of a fight. Odds are he spooked himself and wandered off injured.” 

“Wandered where?” I asked. 

He gestured vaguely into the trees. 

“That’s not how people disappear,” I said. 

“That’s exactly how they disappear,” he replied. “We've both worked enough missing cases.” 

He stood back up. ""There's been how many folks gone missing just in this state alone?"" 

""Too many. But this is different"" I said a bit sharper than intended. 

""How's that? What's different here , Wolfe?"" 

I stood up and stepped slowly over to the fire pit. 

""First the tent. He fell into it, but not running away. Staggered backwards. He was caught off guard. Got back up, and fought back. Its a rough fight, hence the destroyed fire pit. They didn't care about smashing into some flames and hot embers, so the stakes were high. He manages to gets a shot off with his rifle, but no trace of the bullet. Either it sailed to the next county, or found its mark."" 

Paul follows along as I gesture back and forth, walking him through it.

""Okay. A shot like that would be serious. But we haven't seen anybody turn up with burns or a rifle wound at any of the emergency rooms. So where did they go? Where's the blood?"" 

I vaguely gesture to the treeline. ""I don't know. Thats what bothers me."" 

We made the trip back to the car and decided to head back to the station after grabbing some coffee. I mulled over the details with each sip of the corner store's finest. 

Paul was right about one thing, there have been too many disappearances out here. It seems like with each subsequent case there's less and less to go on. Maybe the connections aren't in whats left behind but rather what we don't see. We have more evidence this time, just can't quite connect the dots yet. 

We sat back to back at our shared space in the office, papers and old reports spread between us on the desk.  We were each going through my recent ""missing"" cases on our respective desktops. We were looking for anything that seemed like a similarity between them and when we thought we found something that lined up would take the corresponding paper and tag it to our board. 

I sat my brown paper coffee cup next to the chipped ceramic mug on my desk. Both empty. 

I'd had three individual cases like this in the past four years, now a fourth. 

When you're a detective you get a lot of calls for all sorts of situations, not all are murders and heinous crimes yet somehow they each come with their own mountain of paperwork. It's easy to lose sight of the gravity of certain details in the ritualistic cataloging and recordkeeping. 

Thankfully I'm very thorough. One of the girls in the tech lab, Gabriella, likes to joke whenever I bring in evidence like hairs, cue tip swabs, or one time it was literally a pile of dirt. She would laugh, add it into evidence for analysis and say ""The wolf is on the hunt."" 

The trails ran cold on all of these. I pinned up the last page to the board, a missing hiker named Kerry. Her photo alongside Ethan with his dad, a lost camper and a missing hunter all stared back at me as I stared into their still faces, frozen in time. 

As Paul said, a lot of people go missing in the forests and hills. Diligence pays off, however. Most of those cases ended with a body found. Some of them alive. Those we celebrated. These few that went nowhere gave me a dull ache in the back of my mind. Too little evidence, and total disappearance with what remained offering barely a whisper. Just like Ethan and his father. 

""All dead ends huh?"" 

""Yeah."" I replied. 

""Those are the worst. We had some like that in Violent Crimes. The clock is ticking, You get your hopes up and then you run right into a wall."" He sipped the last of his coffee ""Sometimes literally."" He said that as if the words hurt. 

Paul got transfered over to our precinct for wrecking his police vehicle into a wall chasing after fleeing suspect. Twice. I guess they figured some time away from the wheel and out on the trails would slow him down a bit. He had a passion for the work sure, just reckless. 

Paul leaned back in his chair, eyes still on the board. “You ever think maybe you’re too close to this one?” 

I didn’t answer right away. 

“I mean,” he added, softer now, “you worked his dad’s case. You knew the kid. That kind of thing… it can bend how you see the facts.” 

He finally looked at me then, like he was waiting  for some acknowledgement. 

“Or it can sharpen them."" I said. 

Paul held up a hand. “I’m not saying you’re wrong. Just saying you might be looking for something thats not really there.” 

I turned back to the board. Ethan’s photo stared back at me, same as before. 

""Thats exactly what I'm doing. We've seen what was left behind already"" I gesture to the board. ""What aren't we seeing?"" 

He raised an eyebrow “If this was any other missing hiker,” Paul continued, turning back to his monitor “We’d already be filing it under exposure or misadventure. The only thing thats not there is the kid.” 

That one landed. 

Not because he was accusing me, but because from the department’s point of view, he wasn’t wrong. 

I must have made a face without realizing it because his expression dropped quickly. 

""I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be insensitive, I just don't see."" 

""No, you don't see."" I interrupted him. 

I rubbed my eyes, feeling the strain from Paul's irritating line of thinking and the fluorescent lights of the stale office space. 

I let out a frustrated sigh ""Look, I'm going to get some lunch. You want anything?"" 

""No, I'm good.. Thanks."" Paul said in a more muted tone. 

Before I exited the room I turned back to him. ""Get in touch with Gabs later, see if they got anything off of the cellphone."" Then I left. 

I grabbed a quick drive thru sandwich and left Paul a text. ""Going to go check on something. Will keep you posted."" 

The drive didn't take long. I soon found myself standing at the door to Ethan's apartment. I must have stared at the doorknob for an age before opening it. 

Deep down, paul wasn't wrong. Ethan isn't just another victim, I knew him. Maybe that does cloud my judgment. Maybe I am just grasping at the wind here. 

I walked in past the kitchen and stared at the oak dining table. We usually met up at the old diner across town over a piece of Miss Mays apple pie, but he did invite me over once. 
The table sat lonely and empty. The fridge hummed away behind me. 

The apartment looked the same as it had then. Clean, but lived-in. The muffled noise of a passing car and a ticking clock was the only noises left here. 

I moved through the rooms slowly. Nothing obvious missing. Nothing obviously out of place. We had no idea what he took with him that day so it was impossible to know for sure something more was  unaccounted for. 

My last stop was the bedroom. 

A county map covered most of the wall above his desk. Not decorative. Not framed. Pinned and marked with red ink. 

The map both intrigued me and annoyed me. Whoever cataloged the apartment had almost done a decent job. Almost. Why wasn't there a photo of this map in evidence? 

I stepped closer. 

The first pin sat just left of center. The old quarry. I knew that spot. That was the missing camper. Another pin Northward. The mountain pass. Then his father’s campsite. 

My stomach tightened as the recognition sunk in. These weren’t hiking or hunting spots. They were investigations. The cases I couldn’t close. 

I pressed one with my finger. The eastern trailhead. Kerry’s last location. All we ever found was her left shoe, pointed downwind like she’d simply stepped out of it. 

When we discussed my old cases in the past it was with the intent to give him a process of how I work through the problem. I didn't think he was actually looking for something in them. 

The pins weren’t evenly spaced. They weren’t forming a route or a search grid.
They didn’t make sense other than a checklist. Actually, there was a checkmark by one, and a question mark by another. There were more pins with small symbols but I had no more reference for what they could mean. 

I leaned back, studying the wall, when I noticed something else. 

A sliver of yellow paper stuck out at the bottom corner. A sticky note, tucked behind the map’s corner. Written on it were the words: 

Quiet.

Echoes? 

That explains some of the symbols I saw. There was a few Q's, a PC and an E crossed out. 

It didn't make sense. The last thing I remember from him was where he found the watch and the knife. Those objects locations didn't align with anything on this map and the information they held while strange didn't connect but spread the puzzle further apart. 

I stood there in the silence, waiting for some neuron in my brain to start connecting like an old Morse code machine when it suddenly clicked. 

He wasn't looking for something tangible, he was looking for conditions.

My phone startled me. It was Paul. 

""Hello?"" 

""Hey."" He paused on the line 

""Look, I'm sorry for being an ass earlier. I was rude about you being close to the case. I know you're a good detective. Gabs assured me of that. You find leads where other guys don't, and you don't give up without chasing them to the end. I think that's what really makes a difference in this job."" 

I was surprised, pleasantly so. Maybe he was starting to soften his ridged edges. ""Thank you Paul, I appreciate you saying that."" 

""Anyway, there's something we need to chase down. Gabs said her team finished analyzing Ethan's phone, it was hard to find, but there has been surveillance software running in the background with a long time stamp on it. Somebody was watching him, Derrick. We have a trace to an IP in town. Lets knock and see who answers.""

I was floored. Why would anyone be surveying an ordinary civilian? 

""Absolutely. Just hang tight, I'll be there in fifteen."" 

This just got stranger. This could easily go south, and I'm not ready to turn this over to the feds. 

I will update when we have some answers. 

Right now there's too many holes in this puzzle, too many breadcrumbs with no trail. Whoever took Ethan might still be out there, watching. But so am I, and I will hunt this down.",1,1768060628.0,TheMidnightArchives,0,1.0,False

How to handle this situation?,"We have been married for 12 years. During the initial weeks of our arranged marriage courtship, a male friend of hers expressed romantic interest in her. She rejected him, stating she was already committed and saw him only as a friend. He agreed to remain friends and never asked her out again. He also got married two years later.


​Currently, my wife and this man chat about once a month or during festivals; they also have rare phone calls. I occasionally check their chats, and they seem to consist mostly of life updates, hobbies, business ideas, and shared interests like books, cooking, meditation, and travel. Recently, the frequency has reduced significantly—I have seen only three chats in the last two years. I haven't found anything romantic or emotional in the messages. He attended our wedding, we attended his, and we even visited him for coffee once when we were staying in his city. He has also visited us twice when he was in our town.


​He asked her out during our first month of courtship. For a long time, I was under the impression it happened before I met her because she simply told me back then that ""he had a crush on her, she rejected him, and they are continuing as friends."" However, during a recent discussion about her college life, I learned the specific details of that incident.


​Apparently, he asked her in college: ""Can we meet for a coffee today outside? I want to tell you something important."" She told him to say whatever he wanted to say right there, but he insisted on meeting elsewhere. She told him she couldn't meet him alone, but mentioned she would be visiting a bakery with her friends later and he could join them if he wanted. He didn't say anything that day, but messaged her the next day saying he liked her and wanted to take things forward. She replied that she saw him only as a friend and told him that if he wanted to continue as friends, he could, but otherwise, she didn't want to talk further. He didn't message her for 4 or 5 months after that, but eventually resumed a friendship and never mentioned his romantic interest again.


​Recently, I’ve been hearing a lot about ""micro-cheating"" and ""emotional cheating"" on social media and have learned terms like ""leading him on"" or ""enjoying the attention."" Many people online say it is wrong to keep in touch with someone who once expressed romantic interest. When I expressed my discomfort to my wife, she said she cannot block him because he has never been inappropriate with her since that initial rejection. She pointed out that they don't chat frequently and reminded me that I have full access to the chats. She feels that blocking him now would imply she was doing something wrong all along. She also mentioned that I have female friends (one of whom is a best friend I consider a sister) and that she trusts me without question. She asked why I don't have that same trust in her.



​How can I convince her to stop talking to him, or what would you do in this situation? During our initial courtship, she told me about the time they spent with friends, but she didn't mention that he had asked to meet her alone for coffee to tell her something ""important."" I feel awkward knowing he asked her out even after he knew that marriage discussions between us were already underway.

​Other than this, our relationship is very good. I help with all daily chores, and we take care of our kids well together.",2,1768060543.0,ThirtiesIndia,13,1.0,False

Nothing violent, just property crimes that left everyone feeling uneasy. Suddenly conversations at the coffee shop shifted to security systems, neighborhood watches, and various protection options people were considering.

My neighbor mentioned getting a pepper ball gun as a non lethal deterrent that felt more serious than traditional pepper spray but less extreme than firearms. The logic made sense but it also felt like crossing some threshold into a more defensive mindset. Once you start buying safety equipment, where does it end. Do you become more secure or just more paranoid.

I looked into options out of curiosity and found a surprising range of products designed for home defense without lethal force. Everything from basic models to professional grade equipment, with prices varying based on features and range. Even found wholesale suppliers on Alibaba that cater to this market, which made me realize how common these concerns are globally. My question is whether this kind of preparation actually makes you safer or just feeds anxiety. At what point does reasonable caution become excessive fear. How do you evaluate real risk versus perceived threat. And once you start down the path of defensive equipment, does it change how you see your environment and neighbors. Is feeling safer worth potentially becoming more suspicious.

That I had literally just bought a few months prior to that. 

But honestly I was in the heat of the moment and didn't know where life was going after. So to lighten up my load, I just said you could take this. Since dude was heading over to families to stay, while me and my other roommate was heading to a hotel for a short time. 

When I think about certain things that was actually worth the money, that was up there. And I'm not really trying to spend at all this year. In previous years all my bad spending was either on outside restaurants, buying too much snacks and coffee. As well as buying super unnecessary clothes, that I had no business purchasing being that broke. 

Right for this year, my main focus is just clearing up ALL my debt from the past. That I really didn't have the focus or discipline to in the past. Because I was dealing with these gut and immune health problems for that got worse over a decade. I mean I'm still dealing with it pretty badly, I just got it to a point. Where I can have better understanding of things and just fight thru the gut pain and brain fog daily.  I'm hoping to resolve all my health issues too this year. 

However tho, I need to at least up my entertainment at home to provide some sliver of happiness. As my main form of entertainment just been my phone and my tiny portable speaker.

I live in a low income apartment building. So the outside noise is pretty constant. Where my mentally ill neighbor down the hall is always screaming and being mad at other neighbors for no reason, the one upstairs is always jumping around laughing hysterically, you can hear people's footsteps all day and night and even hear people talk loudly in the lobby. 

With all this you need something to actually drown out the sound. Not make it sound like a concert. Just more so I'm only focused on my music and nothing else to throw off my vibe. Any good suggestions for some speakers that won't really break the bank. Because like I don't really want to be spending money on much at all this year but my debt or health.

**Healthy vs. Ultra-Processed Food: What’s the Difference and Why It Matters**

In today’s food environment, it can be confusing to understand the difference between *healthy foods* and *ultra-processed foods*—especially when convenience and taste are often prioritized over nutrition. Understanding the distinction can help you make choices that support long-term health without falling for misleading marketing or oversimplified “diet” labels.

# What Makes a Food “Healthy”?

When we talk about healthy foods, we’re usually referring to **whole or minimally processed foods**—items that are close to their natural state and rich in nutrients. These include:

* Vegetables and fruits (fresh, frozen, or unsweetened)
* Whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and oats
* Beans and legumes
* Lean proteins such as fish, poultry, and eggs
* Nuts, seeds, and plain dairy products
* Unsweetened beverages like tea and coffee

These foods are typically *nutrient-dense*, meaning they deliver a high amount of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other beneficial compounds per calorie. They provide your body with fuel and nourishment without unnecessary additives or excess calories.

Importantly, the term *healthy* is sometimes misleading. A better term is **nutrient-dense**—foods that provide substantial nutrition relative to their energy content. For example, a bowl of steel-cut oats with fresh berries offers more nutritional value than a bowl of sweetened cereal with the same calorie count.

# What Are Ultra-Processed Foods?

By contrast, **ultra-processed foods (UPFs)** are products that have undergone extensive industrial processing and contain many ingredients not typically used in home cooking. These items often include:

* Artificial colors and flavors
* Preservatives
* Emulsifiers and thickeners
* Added sugars, refined starches, and unhealthy fats

Examples of ultra-processed foods include sugary drinks, packaged snacks, ready-to-eat frozen meals, candies, fast foods, and many breakfast cereals with added sugar. What sets these foods apart is not just the processing itself, but the purpose behind it: *maximizing shelf life, taste, and convenience, often at the expense of nutrient density*

# A Practical Framework: The NOVA Classification

Researchers use a system called **NOVA** to categorize foods by the extent of processing:

1. **Unprocessed or minimally processed foods** — Whole fruits, vegetables, eggs, plain milk
2. **Processed culinary ingredients** — Olive oil, salt, maple syrup
3. **Processed foods** — Foods with added salt, sugar, or oil (e.g., homemade canned vegetables)
4. **Ultra-processed foods** — Factory-made products with many additives and few whole ingredients

This classification helps clarify that not all processing makes a food unhealthy—boiling, fermenting, freezing, or pasteurizing can preserve nutrients and make foods safe. But the step from *processed* to *ultra-processed* adds layers of ingredients designed for texture, taste, and profit rather than nutrition.

# Nutritional and Health Differences

The most important differences between healthy whole foods and many ultra-processed foods include:

**Calories and satiety:**  
Ultra-processed foods tend to be higher in calories but lower in fiber and protein, which means they are less filling and easier to overconsume. In contrast, whole foods help keep you satisfied longer

**Sugar, salt, and fat content:**  
Many ultra-processed products are high in added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats, which are linked to weight gain, metabolic issues, and chronic disease risk

**Additives and nutrient quality:**  
Ingredients like artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives may contribute to inflammation, disrupt the gut microbiome, or encourage overeating. Whole foods, on the other hand, retain their natural nutrients, even when gently processed for safety (e.g., flash-frozen vegetables)

# Can Ultra-Processed Foods Ever Fit Into a Healthy Diet?

Not all ultra-processed foods are equally unhealthy. Some products—like fortified whole grain breads, low-sugar cereals, or certain plant-based milks—can provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals and may fit into a balanced diet, especially when choice and context matter.

The key is to **read ingredient labels and nutritional information**. A shorter ingredient list with recognizably whole food items is often a better choice than long lists of additives and industrial compounds.

# Practical Tips to Choose Better

To prioritize nutrient-dense foods and minimize the downsides of ultra-processed foods:

* Base most meals around unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods
* Choose frozen or canned produce without added sugars or salt
* Opt for whole grains instead of refined versions
* Use ultra-processed items sparingly as time-saving options, not dietary staples

This balanced approach helps you enjoy convenience without sacrificing nutrition, allowing more mindful decisions that support health long-term.

# Food for Thought

The difference between *healthy* and *ultra-processed* foods lies not just in how foods are made, but in their nutritional value and role in your diet. Prioritizing whole, nutrient-dense foods while understanding how processing influences calories, additives, and satiety can empower you to make better choices for long-term health

It was a story that I imagined with a Ghibli lens and so the aim was to keep some of the same pacing and also the small bits of light heartiness and magic. Please let me know what you think!

ps there is a link to the story if anyone finds it easier to read there, and also a link to a free version:

Maya melted into the ground and allowed her body to sink deeper into the dusty hard wooden floor. Candles had been lit, but the house oozed with dark grey. The moonlight split through the darkness like a sleek dagger, and the ember flicker of candle lit added a certain warmth to the colour - but even so, Maya lay flat against the cold floorboards, drowning in the greys of her new house.

As she lay staring at the shadows and cobwebs on the ceiling, the winds blowing through the trees and overgrowth of the forest around her whistled and stirred as though to mock her.

Even the dust, floating and gliding in the spotlight of the moon and candlelight, hovered and fell and swirled as if laughing at her pain and misery.

She lay, hoping to be swallowed by the ground beneath her; urging the earth to open wide and bury her into the stomach of the forest where perhaps she would find some peace, some quiet, some safety.

Tears wet her eyes until the weight of the salty liquid grief spilled over and rolled down and around her slender face.

The trees outside held their breath and a heavy silence filled the house.

The rooms were now littered with Maya’s possessions which sat atop the aged dust and dirt of the house, and yet despite the clutter and messiness in the dark, the house felt empty, and Maya felt more alone than ever.

As shadow and nature alike sat still and peered and stared into the grey void; Maya relented to her sadness and her despairing sobs cut through the heavy silence. As she fought to catch her breath she curled into a ball and wrapped herself tight, trying with all her might to disappear and shrink amongst the boxes of stuff that filled the space around her.

✧

The days turned into weeks, and as they did the darkness of the nights began to grow and slowly absorb the warmth and light of the autumn days. And just as the weeks slipped by, the sharpness of the cold stealthily made its way into the forest and into Maya’s home. The floor boards felt colder and older, and they started to ache and creak and moan more with each passing day.

Maya had made progress in unpacking, but the house increasingly became more akin to an obstacle course of half empty boxes and scattered piles of *stuff*.

The spiders too had noticed the creeping of the winter and had become temporary residents. They had taken shelter in the dark corners and had built their webs and pathways over doors and furniture. They felt fortunate to have a house guest like Maya, who paid neither them or their dangling webs any mind or attention.

They had come to watch over Maya and her days spent moping from her bedroom to the sofa. They watched with sympathy as she spent evenings alone cuddled under a blanket wiping tears from her eyes.

Progress on the house was slow.

On one cold evening she lay on the sofa and contemplated the increasingly difficult journey across the room to the stairs, the arduous and perilous ascent up to the first floor, and the final leg to her room and into bed. She finished the last drop of water from her plastic bottle and allowed her arm to flop.

Everything was very much hard work.

She allowed her hand to relax and the empty plastic bottle slipped through her grip and dropped to the floor. It settled with new found company among the food wrappers and other discarded plastic bottles.

The spiders looked down and frowned; worried at the state of their new found home.

✧

Maya opened her eyes.

She had drifted to sleep on the sofa. The journey to her bedroom had seemed too daunting before she had found the relief of her slumber, but as she hugged herself tightly and felt her body shiver, perhaps this was the wrong night to settle for the blanket.

The house was silent. The spiders and the floorboards were peacefully sleeping, and even the wind and trees outside were compliant, abiding by everyone’s need for rest and a good night’s sleep.

Maya pulled the blanket over her head, and began to breathe hot air from her mouth into the sanctuary of her new safe space.

She allowed a faint smile to form. It had felt like an age since she had felt any sense of joy, but for some reason her impersonation of a dragon to provide the warmth for her blanket touched upon an innocence and playfulness that had been buried and hidden.

It was then that she flinched.

A noise… from the floor?

Perhaps a draught of wind had tickled the rubbish on the floor? Perhaps a mouse scurrying through the maze?

Maya dared not move, but felt silly all the same.

The house had moved, she thought, or perhaps she hadn’t heard anything after all.

✧

Maya woke once more, this time to the soft light of morning filling the house. The warmth had started to soak into the walls and the floors, and the house began to wake, feeling refreshed and grateful for the cheery greeting from the morning sun.

The spiders felt energised, and the floorboards and supports welcomed the warm embrace of daylight, feeling happy and ready to hold up the house for another day.

Maya on the other hand, scrunched her eyes and felt the puffiness of her cheeks. Whilst she had slipped quickly back to sleep, her face and eyes felt heavy and she didn’t quite feel the level of replenishment that her eight legged house mates felt.

She slumped her head to the side and stared aimlessly at the mess piling up and the half empty boxes, at the newest layer of dust and the marks where she had disrupted it the day before, and the three empty plastic bottles stood up and organised neatly against the wall.

She ran her hand through her hair and-

Maya blinked hard and took a second, then third, then fourth look at the plastic bottles.

Even the spiders in the corner of the room froze in their webs and gave confused glances to one another.

She lay on the sofa, puzzled and confused. She jumped off the sofa and onto the floor, frantically looking for the discarded plastic bottle from the night before.

The floor was still cold, and her frantic scrambling and flailing caused wrappers and boxes alike to crash and crumple, and she desperately searched for that missing piece of sanity.

Maya paused, flustered. Her dark hair was now bushy and ruffled from her scurrying across the floor.

She stared at the bottles still, and cautiously, and slowly, crawled to the bottles.

The spiders watched, holding their breaths, and paralysed by anticipation, as Maya inched closer and closer to the bottles.

She dragged herself on her hands and knees until she was within touching distance of the three culprits.

She bit her lower lip gently, and she reached out…

In an act of courage and blind faith and trust, so she told herself, her hand moved closer and closer and closer…

*tap*

Maya felt as though the world itself stood still and held its breath and she pressed her finger against one of the bottles. She did not know what she expected, but she had to know that the bottles were real.

And, nothing happened.

She blinked several times more, and then burst into laughter.

✧

Several days had passed since the *bottle incident*. Winter had continued its march toward the village, and it was starting to bring with it friends in the form of a bitter chill and an ever increasingly aggressive wind which clamoured against Maya’s house and rattled the windowpanes.

Maya had kept herself busy by learning how to use the fire, albeit with varying success.

She had, on one occasion, managed to nurture a caring and warm flame that danced and flickered at just the right speed that the entire room was filled with an ember glow and a deep, beautiful comfort. The spiders edged closer to warm their little bodies, and Maya had sat enamored by the yellows and oranges, entrapped in a perpetuating ballet - gracefully flowing and shimmering, and touching and warming her bones. She had sat with a sparkle in her eyes and a beaming smile across her face - *the princess of fire* she thought to herself.

But, much like the fleeting feeling of joy and happiness that filled Maya’s heart, so too was the warmth of the fire short lived.

Try as she might, the fire either burned too bright and too consuming that it quickly burned out; or the heat of the embers failed to ignite and spark to life long enough to hold back the ensuing attack of the bitterness that winter was bringing.

Where she had succeeded, however, was in creating more mess in the form of soot and potential ingredients for the fire.

She had thought about the bottles. Though, she had come to realise that she had perhaps quickly tidied up when she was half asleep. She did have trouble staying asleep, and her tired mind was always keen and ready to play tricks on her - especially in the night. She regularly awoke to noises and shapes in the dark; and momentarily those shapes took the form of evil things with sinister intent - until her eyes adjusted and those nasty things turned out to be the shadow of a coat.

And so, she quickly rationalised the three plastic bottles standing upright against the wall, as nothing more than a lapse in her memory, or perhaps a symptom of her tired mind.

One particular time of reminiscing for example, she had noticed a small spider on the floor. She noticed it so because she had become paranoid at the thought that a mouse had taken lodging in her house, and a small dark object warranted investigating.

On closer inspection, this small dark object turned out to be a small spider barely crawling along the floor. She had crouched down and felt the shadow of sadness touch her heart, for the little spider seemed to be injured or tired. Maya coaxed it gently onto her hand and carefully moved it to one of the webs in the corner of the room, hoping to give it a helping hand to its home where it could recuperate.

Spiders do not smile, and nor do they speak. But for a very brief moment Maya thought she had heard a thank you, or a small smile at least.

And so, if her brain could tell her that - it’s no wonder she forgot tidying up the bottles.

✧

Maya woke once more in the middle of the night. This time, from the comfort and safety of her bed.

She curled up into a ball and pulled her sheets in tight.

As she willed herself to fall back to sleep, she could not help but notice that everything else was calmly dreaming and relaxing in their peaceful slumber. It was as though the entire world had allowed itself to stop and pause and to sit in the calmness and safety of the night together. The house purred with deep yet smooth breaths, and Maya could only imagine that nature itself, all the trees and plants alike and even the animals and creatures big and small, were also experiencing the unity and embrace of a good night’s sleep.

The feeling of isolation hit Maya, and a sense of unease and anxiety flooded her body.

She sighed and kicked her leg out in frustration.

She felt the heaviness and toll of her tiredness, and looked at the window to gauge just how much of the night had passed.

*Not a flicker of dawn*.

She was alone in the darkness once more, and the awareness of her isolation and her despair filled her with even more unease. The blanket of despair was slowly weighing her down, as the dark cloud of panic and frustration started to fester and take over her body and mind.

She squeezed her eyes tightly, and her breathing intensified.

And then, she heard the sound of a bottle falling over from downstairs. It was undeniable.

Her eyes shot open once more and she focused.

Now, rather than being aware of the soft, peaceful, slumber of her surroundings, and the isolation and emptiness of the silence around her; *she could hear something downstairs*.

Something was downstairs.

Something was moving.

Its movements were not hurried or panicked; but slow, and deliberate.

*Footsteps*, that were soft and slow. Whatever was downstairs, felt safe that it too was alone in the darkness.

✧

Maya held her breath. Time slowed down and her senses were working overtime.

The soft patter of the footsteps downstairs were now amplified, and the only other sound caught in Maya’s world was the increasingly active thumping of her heart. The rolling beats echoed from the middle of her chest and were now creating bouncing ripples through her pyjama top.

Her leg shot out of her covers, and both Maya and the spiders in her room were shocked.

Her legs were leading her out of bed; and before she could question her rebellious limb, she found herself slowly opening her door.

The air in the house was still and quiet. Now outside the safety of her room, a soft hue of a bright full moon sat like glistening mist throughout, adding the perfect backlight for the slow and serene floating of dust and air.

She tip-toed carefully to the top of the stairs where she flinched at her shadow being painted onto the wall. She turned and grimaced at the window and moon that had seemingly found the perfect spot in the night’s sky to catch a watchful eye on the mystery at hand, and unwittingly blew Maya’s cover.

The pitter patter of the footsteps abruptly ended; and the silence was so loud that Maya dropped to the floor.

She slithered forward and cautiously peered round and down the stairs.

The moon, now feeling rather pleased with its role in the scene and craving further attention, had also shone a magical light through the lower floor of the house. Its light split through the front room like a shimmering blade made from the sky itself. A soft and beautiful glow dissolved outwards adding detail to the boxes and furniture.

So too, did it add detail to the owner of the tiny footsteps.

It stood there, cautiously looking out into the distance, and seemingly half sheltering behind the sofa. It was small; a foot tall at the most. Its big dark eyes flickered as the moonlight caught them, and Maya couldn’t help but notice what looked like raised eyebrows and a sad frown on its face.

Maya thought it looked green, and it definitely had fur.

She contorted her body so as to slowly descend the stairs.

It had not seen her, but it was still looking out to the back of the house and scanning the area.

As Maya crept down the stairs, she could make out a small yellow flower tucked in the fur on its head.

It too seemed emboldened, and the tension in its little body seemed to disappear as it relaxed. It took a couple steps into the middle of the room, and pulled a small brush from its belt. Maya stopped and watched.

It made its way to the fireplace where it started to sweep the soot as best as it could with its brush.

Maya saw that its belt also had a small acorn, and a leaf that resembled an apron.

Before Maya knew it, she had made her way to the bottom of the stairs and stood only a few feet away from the creature. She watched with dumbfounded curiosity as it was entranced by its sweeping and gentle scratching on the wooden floor.

“Er - hello there” she said awkwardly, and waved politely in the direction of the mysterious little creature. She smiled widely, showing her teeth in a cheesy grin, and the cold room became all that bit warmer from the happiness and comfort that she exuded into the room.

“I’m Maya it’s nice to-”

“EEEEE!”

The little creature screeched, which caught Maya off guard. But, despite the panic, the cuteness of its screech only encouraged Maya more.

“Sorry to surprise you-”

The little creature threw its little paws into the air and it darted off away from Maya.

“EEEEEEE”

Its screech and the drumming of its scurrying feet tapped away frantically at the hard floor as it fled.

Maya took a step forward, but before she could react, the creature had disappeared. She raced to the lantern and lit it. The orange flicker now illuminated the room, and she scrambled in the direction of the small creature.

✧

Maya spent the remainder of the night in a state of frantic searching and mystical curiosity. Amidst her sleep deprivation and thoughts of darkness, a small, green, furry thing had dropped into her life like a glistening emerald drop of magic; the drop of which was now adding that curious spark in Maya’s mind.

She had searched everywhere, and had not even taken a second to rest. She had jumped head first into the magic and embraced it without fear or doubt.

She did, however, find herself lamenting just how messy the house had become. It was no wonder, she thought, that she couldn’t find anything when it had become such a chaotic and disgusting mess.

The moon had eventually got bored of the lack of action and had drifted away from view. In its place, the sun peered over the horizon with a warm grin and warmth that Maya welcomed with open arms.

The spiders too, woke with a smile as the cold creaks and the hidden mysteries of the darkness of the night faded and made way for the low ember light shining into the house.

And they woke to see Maya on her hands and knees, tracking what she thought to be the tiny footsteps of the small cleaning creature.

As she traced the footsteps imprinted into the dusty floor, she crept forward like a clumsy bloodhound being led by its super sensitive nose. Maya was in the zone, and she would unravel this mystery.

But, as she followed her senses and the small tracks, she lost the scent due to an unforeseen development; the floors at the back of the house were dustless.

It was with some degree of irony that she was now bemoaning a clean floor. She looked up at the sliding door at the rear of the house. It must have been the breeze from having the door open. She had regularly sat on the step of the backdoor looking out into the deep green forest behind the house.

She slid open the door and perched down onto her thinking spot and looked into the depths of the forest once more.

It was dark and overgrown - it was a complex and dense natural cave of trees and undergrowth that held a curious aura. It was telling the world that it was hiding treasures, and secrets, and answers, but that to enter would be a dangerous adventure. It was gloomy and heavy, but to Maya, it seemed inviting and full of possibilities.

✧

The forest had captured Maya’s attention, and it spoke to her with an otherworldly, deep vibration that echoed and reverberated through her bones and to her core. The abyss was calling and its magic was calling to Maya.

A quiet breeze flowed through the trees, and the leaves and plants rattled in unison; it was as though the forest was calling out to Maya and the emerald and green were beckoning her to the dark core.

She gazed into the unknown, willingly allowing her soul to slowly be pulled into the direction of the forest.

A whistling gust blew through once more. It shot through the forest crashing against the house whipping Maya’s dark hair across her face into a dishevelled mess.

She snapped out of her trance and shook herself free.

Maya turned and looked back into the house, shivering slightly. As the wind settled, the sunlight cut across the floor, and the layer of dust flickered and glimmered, highlighting the strange boundary where the dust ended and the clean wood floor began.

But this time, Maya spotted something else.

The draft was not only blowing through the open door. The dust near the skirting board was rolling and dancing like specks of sand shimmering across dunes.

Maya walked back inside and knelt down beside the wall where the draft was escaping from the wall.

Hidden amongst the shadow of the skirting board was a loose panel.

Maya traced her hand along the wooden wall and felt the dividing fracture in the skirting board. She hesitated and brushed her hand over the now visible panel.

She pulled back before reaching out once more.

Her fingers were now trembling, and she hooked her fingernails into the gap and pulled.

*Creak.*

The panel shook and the wood gave way, with a reluctant groan and a low pop. Once removed, Maya discovered what looked to be a small service cupboard, long forgotten.

Maya crouched lower, pressing her cheek against the floorboard to peer into the darkness in the wall.

It took a moment for her eyes to adjust, but there, huddled in the corner of the dusty crawlspace, was a small, trembling ball of green fur.

✧

The small creature was cuddled up on its side facing the wall. It had pulled the leaf over its body as a makeshift duvet.

Maya’s heart dropped and her entire body filled with despair as she realised that the small green creature was desperately sobbing. Its small body rose and sank as it whimpered; its green fur shook with hopeless sobs.

Warm tears glossed Maya’s dark eyes and she reached out instinctively to the weeping creature.

As she did so, the small creature jumped in shock and surprise, caught unawares that its moment of sadness was being witnessed by a stranger.

Maya spoke no words, but she understood.

The creature backed away and Maya’s already sunken heart dropped another few inches as she saw that she had unknowingly cornered the small creature and intruded on its safety.

Maya pulled away, and went to speak - but she hesitated.

The creature’s small body was shaking, and its large eyes opened widely, communicating the creature’s fear and shock at Maya’s presence.

Maya spotted two plastic bottles lined up against the wall next to the creature’s small makeshift bed. She also saw the pile of neatly folded and pressed food wrappers. Maya’s heart emptied once more; and she was taken aback that it could empty and sick more than just moments previously - and to compound the failing of her heart, she felt the air leave her body for good measure. She felt disgusted at herself - these wrappers and bottles were the remnants of her messy neglect.

Maya gulped and swallowed.

Her lip began to twitch, and try as she may, it trembled and a solitary tear rolled down her flushed face.

The small creature flinched and tilted its head.

Maya withdrew from the cubby hole and sat cross legged on the cold floor. She sat silently for a moment, and the creature inched forward out of curiosity.

It watched diligently as Maya walked away - only to return moments later, arms full with rubbish and wrappers.

She dropped them to the floor, and resumed her position sitting crossed legged in front of the creature’s room.

She carefully began straightening out the individual pieces of rubbish and arranging them into a neat pile. As she did, the small creature watched with a child-like curiosity. It was no longer trembling in fear, but was watching with a hesitant and cautious intrigue.

“I feel ashamed,” said Maya. The small creature looked up with its large eyes as Maya spoke.

“I’ve been a mess, and I’ve let this home turn into a tip.”

Maya continued to fold and organise the litter, not looking up as she did so or when she spoke.

“I guess you’ve been trying to clean for me, I don’t know. I’m ashamed that you had to do this for me. I’m sorry that I scared you.”

Maya forced a small, but fake smile.

*Tap, tap, tap.*

The small creature had stepped out of the safety of its room and pulled a piece of a food wrapper in front of Maya. It used both of its soft hands to fold it before flattening it down; before grabbing another piece.

Maya smiled.

✧

The house saw a slow but deliberate invigoration in the days that followed Maya’s formal meeting with the small green creature.

Maya had tried to be conscientious of her new roommate, although she was still perplexed and curious as to whether new was the right word. Was she the new roommate? Can you be a roommate to a small green furry creature that likes to clean and wears a leaf as an apron?

*Was she in fact just losing her mind?*

The thoughts had bounced around her mind whilst trying to sleep, and yet as she lay for what seemed like hours in the cold and quiet darkness of night, she swore she could hear the small pitter patter of soft feet and the soft scratching of a tiny makeshift broom.

The spiders too, despite their small stature and somewhat quiet existence in the house, had started to be more responsible with their web laying. A good and secure web is an efficient and tidy web, afterall. Stray lines are unnecessary, and a waste of effort, *so it was said.*

Winter had now definitively made its camp at the house. Whilst the snow had yet to fall, the nights were becoming sharper and the air itself now carried a cutting and abrasive freshness to it that had crossed the line of freshness and moved towards offensive.

The small creature had not exactly become a visible part of the household, but neither was it so keen to hide its existence - which filled Maya with a strange sense of warmth and joy. It lit a spark inside her that encouraged her to continue with her tidying.

As the house became more clean, so did the heaviness on her heart.

She was working her way through two half empty cardboard boxes and a pile of rubbish. It was laborious, and Maya hated tidying, but she could hear the small and soft pattering away from the other side of the room.

*Fold, smooth, fold, smooth, drag.*

The creature could work with a rhythmic efficiency, but my goodness, Maya was not going to be outdone by a creature barely one fifth her size, and she took a deep breath to reset her focus.

Maya still felt a sense of shame about the state of the house, and she felt even more aware knowing that her lack of care was visible to others, even if those others were a small fluffy thing.

Maya reached for the next item in the heap. Her fingers brushed against stiff card, rather than the shiny and flimsy plastic.

She pulled it free.

It was a train ticket. Orange and white, crumpled and stained with coffee but the date was still visible. It was three months ago, the day she left.

The machine-like tapping and folding of the creature stopped. It sensed the shift in the air immediately.

Maya sat and stared at the small rectangular piece of card in her hand, and suddenly the joy and warmth filling the house erupted with a fierce and sharp cackle and dropped with a cold crushing thump. A haunting silence filled the house, and Maya shivered - not from the now icy air, but from the violent tremor that started from her heart and vibrated through her body.

In that moment, Maya was lost to the present, and she had been stolen and forcefully removed by a painful and harrowing memory - high pitched screech of brakes, the roar of a station announcer, the crushing weight of hundreds of bodies rushing on a busy train platform, and the unrelenting and disorientating shouts and murmurs of the crowds.

“I wasn’t meant to come here”, she whispered. Her voice cracked, dry and brittle.

“It happened so fast, I -”

She dropped the train ticket, and it fell to the ground like the last dead leaf of winter.

She grabbed hold of her body, grasping at herself with all her might. She pulled her knees to her chest, closing in on herself, burying her face into the fabric of her trousers.

“I-”

“I just couldn’t do it anymore.”

She began to sob. She could not hold in the grief and sadness any longer. As her tears began to fall, an implosion of despair and depression sucked through the cold and violence, and made way to a heavy and dense fog of desperation and hopelessness.

“I couldn’t take it. I tried my best, but I just couldn’t do it. Every single day I tried. Every single day I fought and struggled, and I still couldn’t do it.”

She pressed her hands into her eyes.

“I really did try my best. I told them all, I told them how hard it was, but no one ever believed me. And why should they? They all managed, so why should I be any different? Why would anyone believe that I was so pathetic and weak that I just couldn’t do the normal things, the day to day things that everyone found so easy.”

“I tried so hard.”

She sobbed more.

“I spent so long pretending to be someone else, that I had lost everything, every sense of who I was, of what I wanted - and boy did everyone ask me, *what do you want to do Maya, what do you want Maya, what do you like Maya* \- I DON’T KNOW!”

She thumped the ground.

“How can I know what I want when I spent my whole life pretending to be someone else! Argh!”

Maya’s voice hitched and cracked as she screamed with a frustrated roar.

“Every single time I let the mask slip, every single time I tried to be myself, someone always ended up getting hurt. I was pathetic, or wasn’t trying hard enough, or too miserable, or too weird - every single time I started being myself, I let everyone down.”

Her breath hitched and she swallowed.

“If I kept going, I’d end up dead. I had nothing left. I had killed my soul trying to fit in and I was left with nothing. And when I tried to give myself a chance, I was unlovable.”

“Why - “

She paused, catching her breath.

“Why wasn’t I ever enough?”

She grabbed her hair and squeezed her eyes tightly.

“If my only value to people was when I was setting myself on fire to keep them warm, then what’s the point? I just wanted someone to see me - I just wanted someone to understand and see me; to trust me and love me, for me? I don’t blame them, I get it. How could someone get it or love me when I’m…me?”

“That’s why I’m here,” Maya whispered. “I thought I could run away, and eventually I’d be forgotten.”

Maya looked at the pile of trash.

“If they even noticed I was gone. I’m just that person who was there - just an empty space reflecting what everyone wanted of me.”

Maya felt a soft touch on her knee, and she froze.

She peeked through her fingers.

The small green creature stood in front of her with its big dark eyes, and in its other hand it held the train ticket. It laid it softly on the floor between them, and carefully folded it half.

*Fold, smooth, pat.*

Then, the creature reached out. It leaned its furry head against Maya’s shin, resting its weight against her.

✧

The days that followed did not bring a miracle cure for Maya. December continued to bleed and the coldness engulfed the house.

Each day required more firewood, and each day Maya’s skill in tending to the fire grew.

A routine formed in the dust, and Maya slowly sought to bring order to the chaos that had taken over the house.

But now, she was not alone.

She had shared the grief and overwhelming weight of the mess and disorder in the house with the small and mysterious little green creature, and together they shared the burden of giving it new life.

Maya did not forget her desperation nor her sadness at the world. She grieved for herself, and she wondered whether she would ever feel whole. She had felt as though she was not made for this world, and perhaps she wasn’t; but she had realised that that was probably for the best.

She never wanted to be the reason someone felt as lonely and unloved as she had felt. She grieved the life she could have had if someone had seen and understood the pain she was living through and the suffering she was enduring to simply exist in such a shallow and confusing world.

It should have been so easy, she thought.

✧

It was the 24th of December.

The fire was roaring with an impressive vigour, and the warmth and dazzling yellows and oranges painted the room with a magical display of enchanting glow.

Snow had eventually covered the house with a soft and fluffy carpet of frozen dust - creating an idyllic and beautiful scene amongst the backdrop of the emerald forest.

The forest too seemed to hum with a cosy and mystical comfort. A strange and colourful breeze emanated from it as though its spirit was joining the house in the Christmas festivities.

The fire crackled and popped.

The house wasn’t spotless, but the front room was transformed and in the corner stood a small, crooked, half decorated tree.

The small creature sat on the sofa, its small yellow flower still tucked in its fur on its head. It smiled with genuine warmth and happiness as Maya entered the room with two mugs.

One was a small espresso cup, which she gave to the creature, who gratefully took and held it with both its furry little paws.

The other, a regular-sized mug, she held onto, and she carefully sat down onto the sofa.

A beautiful wisp of hot air rose from the mugs. It rose and danced with delight, and it spiraled as it climbed higher and higher. The hot delicacy that it was born from was a rich, smooth, and tasty mug of hot chocolate.

Maya looked at her companion and smiled.

“Merry Christmas.”

Now, it’s all for naught, and I can’t risk being pulled over by Protector police as I make my way out the galaxy to hunker down for a few months.

Act I

___________________________
     
He placed the mop against the wall and wiped his brow with his cracking, soap-dried hand, the result of sifting through hot dishwater for hours on end. The lights were starting to hurt his eyes, and the soles of his feet were sore. His tongue was a barren desert.
     
With a deep sigh, he admired his handiwork. The maroon tiles that a few hours ago had been splattered with flecks of fallen food and stained with unknown condiments now glimmered in the fluorescent lights. The dish-pit was spotless, free of soap suds and soggy food remnants. He had made sure to dry off the metal countertop beside it and wipe it down with bleach, as the sitting water often made the entire kitchen smell like an outhouse. He’d even wiped down the wall behind it.
      
“Momma would be proud,” he thought to himself. 
     
Scratching at the hair of his neck, he made his way to the back office. Mrs. Kruft sat behind her desk, finishing work on her computer. The crisp light of the screen hit her glasses, making her eyes appear as though they were glowing in the dark. 
     
“Um…pardon me ma’am,” he requested politely.
     
“What do you need Benny?” Mrs. Kruft replied without looking up.
     
“ I…uh…I just wanted to let you know I’m done.”
     
“Uh huh.”
     
Benny waited.
     
“Is that all?” she asked.
     
“Yeah.”
     
“If you’re done with everything, you can just clock out. You don’t have to ask.”
     
“Oh no…I was just uh… okay… I’m just gonna go… I’m just gonna go uh… clock out.”
    
“Yep.”
     
Benny waited until he was out of eye-line before letting his lips succumb to a sneer. No one ever said “thank you” anymore.
     
As he stood at the clocking-out screen and typed in his employee number, he recalled what Momma had once said. “These computers are gonna replace us one day,” he could hear her grumbling as she watched TV. “It seems to me like they just want to turn computers into people and people into computers.” Momma was right, and it had already happened. Everywhere he went, he was greeted with a computer screen. They had them in doctors’ offices, in libraries. They even had them in fast-food restaurants now, instead of cashiers. They fed him, healed him, told him when to start work and when to go home. He often found himself wishing he lived back in Momma’s age.
     
As the pay stub rolled out with a mechanical whine, a message appeared on the screen…
     
“Good Work Benjamin! See You Soon!”
     
Benny took the stub and slipped through the door into the dining area. The room was mostly empty, and almost all of the lights were out, as “Jim’s Diner” had closed an hour and a half ago. The exception was the table in the corner, across the floor, where a small group of waiters, servers, and bussers had gathered under a single, amber light. Benny watched from the pitch shadows as they laughed together, each drinking a beer. They hadn’t noticed him standing there yet, and he was glad. It was better this way, like a TV show.
     
Benny had never spoken to them, but he knew all of their names. The tall one was Steven. The pretty one was Jean. The ugly one was Trevor. The old one was Beth. The one with a meth addiction was Nance. None of them had told him this; he had a keen ear.
    
Benny remembered the time Steven had asked him if he thought Jean was into him. Benny told him that the only way to find out was to ask. “Momma always said ‘You miss one-hundred percent of the shots you don’t take!’” he’d said. Later that day, Steven exchanged numbers with Jean and they’d been together ever since.
     
Then there was the time Beth’s car broke down and she had no money for the cab ride home. Benny saw how distraught she was and gave her ten dollars. “I’m sorry it’s not much, if I had more, I’d give it to you. I just give what I can. Momma always said, ‘It’s better to give a little than to give none at all!”
     
Benny was proudest of the time he found Nance crying in the deep freezer. She was losing her house. Her kids were going into foster care. He gave her a card for narcotics anonymous. “Momma always said, ‘Nobody’s too far gone!’”
     
Unfortunately, none of these things had ever happened. They were just Benny’s stories. He had a lot of them.
     
Like the time Jean’s ex-boyfriend came in looking for trouble and Benny fought him off with a frying pan. Or the time he put together a surprise party for Trevor. Or the time Mrs. Kruft couldn’t get to work and she called to have Benny put in charge for a day. None of it was real but… what difference did it make? 
     
Across the room, Steven finally noticed Benny in the darkness. They made eye contact, and Steven gave him an odd look. After a moment, he sent an awkward wave. Benny waved back.
     
Benny ducked into the kitchen and left out the back door. As he stepped out into the dark, he tightened up his jacket and bundled himself in his own arms. The December air was bitter that night. He could feel it settle under his skin, like a parasite. 
     
The parking lot was illuminated by the warm glow of the streetlights. There were a few lonely cars, asleep in the lot. Aside from an alley cat, watching him from atop the dumpster, Benny was alone. Even the boulevard, which was normally raging with a stampede of cars, was still. The only sound was the crinkle of a grocery bag wrapped around a chain-linked fence. 
     
As Benny made his way to the sidewalk, he glanced around into every dark corner. He’d seen things on the news, about stabbings and muggings and immigrants, and all the other things. “Stanton is going down the gutter,” talking heads shouted all day and all night. On Channel Eight they swore to no end that Edmund Thompson would fix things when he became mayor. On Channel Nine it was Alex Marcellus who was going to save the city. Benny thought he’d do a good job in office. Momma always said he had the makings of a politician.
     
Benny turned left down the boulevard, keeping far from the road. His apartment complex was a couple blocks down, past the construction zone and the gas station, and across the street from the abandoned pawn shop. He lived alone there, which wasn’t something he minded, but he wished Momma could stop worrying about him. 
     
“Don’t you want a family?” she pleaded over the phone.
     
“I have plenty of time to start a family, Momma.”
     
“You’re thirty-six, Benny! That time will go before you know it! Aren’t there any pretty girls at work?”
     
“Yeah, but-”
     
“Sweetie, you have to live at some point.”
     
Benny had promised to call that night, but he was thinking he might have to put it off again. 
    
To his left, the desolate expanse of the construction zone stretched out for a hundred feet, ending at the back fence of a car dealership. The pale moon dripped honey over the dirt hills and rusted construction equipment, like the heat lamp of some abandoned terrarium for metal creatures. He wondered what they were building- a fast food restaurant or a strip mall?
     
He passed the wasteland and reached the gas station parking lot. The sidewalk was easier to see now, illuminated by the bright lights of the gas canopies. The windows of the convenience store beckoned him in with siren songs of liquor and cigarettes, but the door held a bright red “closed” sign. At the intersection beyond, red and green lights beamed down from above, but no cars passed through. No pedestrians crossed the street. For five minutes, Benny was the only man in the world…
     
He reached the corner and hit the button to cross. The words, “Don’t Walk” blinked insistently from the crossing light. Though the road was empty, Benny obeyed. Momma always said, “It’s better to be safe than sorry!”
     
From the darkness of an adjacent street, a man on a bicycle floated out atop the asphalt, veering left and right lazily through the void. As he drew closer, his bearded face became clearer. It was like a cliffside, with cracks and crevices spreading out across his skin. Matted white hair poured out from his scalp and chin, wrapping around his face like a thorny bush. He was clad in jeans, work boots, a faded duffle coat, and a heavy backpack, all of which were covered in holes and stains. As he drifted into the gas station parking lot, his wild eyes zeroed in on Benny. 
     
“Five-five!” he cried out in a rasping voice. Benny glanced at the crossing light, fidgeting with his hands. “Don’t Walk.”
     
The old man approached, swinging out in front of Benny in the street.
     
“Could you spare a dollar sir,” he asked, revealing his yellowing, jumbled teeth. As he spoke, he circled around Benny on his bike, like a shark. Benny worried he was going to hurt him, so he hit the button a few more times. “I need money for the payphone. I gotta call my daughter.”
     
“I-I’m sorry. I don’t… I don’t have any money.”
     
“Alls I need is a dollar, Sir.”
     
“I-I don’t… I don’t have one. I’m sorry.”
     
“Five-five”
     
The homeless man rolled around behind him. Benny hit the button again.
     
“Surely you have a dollar.”
     
“I’m sorry, I don’t…I don’t have it.”
     
“I need to call my daughter.”
     
“Well I can’t…I can’t help you.”
     
“Five-five.”
     
The little glowing man on the crossing sign appeared at last. Benny ignored the crosswalk, choosing to cross diagonally to the next corner. The old man followed, still circling around him.
     
“Five-five,” he repeated.
     
“It’s-it’s half-past-eleven,” Benny corrected.
     
“Matthew Five-Five.”
     
Benny stepped onto the curb. He was walking faster now.
     
“It’s really just a dollar.” 
     
“If I had it, I would- I would give it to you but-
     
“Sir, it's just a dollar.”
     
“I know, I under- I understand, but I don’t-”
     
“Matthew Five- Five.”
     
“I don’t know what that… what that means-”
     
“But my daughter-”
     
“I don’t have any money, you vagrant!” Benny finally shrieked, surprising himself. The old man furrowed his brow in confusion, veering away. 
     
“The meek shall inherit the earth,” he muttered as he drifted back out into the street, eventually disappearing down a side street.
     
Benny kept walking, fuming steam through his breath. The very air made him sick. “People have no decency anymore,” Momma used to say. “And no one wants to work! They just want handouts!” The news said the same thing. “We have a problem in this country!” they all proclaimed, but no one could agree on what it was. Benny knew. It was people. People were the problem. They were all black holes, and there would never be enough stars in the universe to fill their appetites.
     
As though manifested from his fury, the towering shape of the apartment complex rose up above him, looming over like a mountain across the parking lot. Most of the lights were out, aside from one: third floor, third from the right.
     
The woman who lived there was named Sarah. She had never told him her name, but he often heard her boyfriend scream it through the thin walls when they argued. Benny made up stories about her too.
     
Like the day he heard commotion from her room and intervened, fighting off her crazed boyfriend. Or the time she finally chose to leave and needed a place to stay, so Benny offered to sleep on the couch so she could have the bed. Or when, a few hours later, her boyfriend came pounding on the door, shouting threats, so Benny used Momma’s lessons to make him see the error of his ways. He reckoned he had made more stories about her than anyone else.
     
She had always struck him as the kind of girl he’d like to take to dinner- the kind of girl to take on long drives through the countryside in the car he always owned in his imagination. She’d never spoken to him once, but he often imagined introducing her to his mother, her blonde hair adorning the windsor chair beside Momma’s china cabinet, as though she had always been there.
     
Her boyfriend, on the other hand, reminded him of a bull. Two pin-point coals peered out from under the collage of muscles that composed his face, threatening to burst out from under his skin at the slightest expression. His sleeves were filled with tattooed tree trunks, and a short, velcro beard grew like a well-watered lawn from his ship-stern jaw. In the entire time he had lived next door, Benny had only ever seen him wear two different shirts: a clean, black T-shirt he wore over his jeans to work, and a stained white T-shirt he wore over a pair of grey sweatpants when he got back home.
     
Nothing about her boyfriend had ever suggested to Benny that he had thoughts. He didn’t believe he had emotions either. As far as he could understand him, he was more of a creature than a man.
     
Of course, these weren’t things someone should think about their neighbor. Like Momma always said, “People aren’t simple!”
     
Still burning after his conversation with the man on the bike, Benny stormed onward, making for the entrance door. As he walked, his eyes floated down to the ground, where they settled on an odd shape atop the asphalt.
     
It was a worm. 
     
The little, blind creature wriggled around, searching for soil through the impenetrable blacktop. It moved slowly, nearly paralyzed by the cold, and a few times it stopped completely. Yet, no matter how long it paused, it always came back to life, curling into a loop and flipping over. 
    
He’d watched a documentary once that claimed that worms hibernated underground during the winter. If that was true, He could only wonder how it got all the way out here in the middle of the parking lot. The longer he watched it struggle in vain to dig itself to life, the more he pitied it.
     
As gently as he could, he pinched the worm at the midpoint of its body and picked it up, dropping it into his cupped palm. It felt cool and wet on his skin as it writhed about, learning the confines of his hand. For a moment, he felt less lonely.
      
There was a small patch of grass and weeds behind the dumpster at the edge of the lot, overlooked by a billboard across the street. Written on the blank, white vinyl in bold, black text and illuminated by spotlights was a single question: “What has God seen?” It was here, behind the dumpster and beneath the billboard, that Benny set the worm down.
     
The worm rolled around a little, coating itself in pale grains of dirt. At first, he thought it would make it under, but whether it was because it was too weak after the hours it had spent on the asphalt, or because the soil was too firm from the cold, the worm failed to dig past even the first layer. 
     
Determined to save the worm, Benny dug a small pit in the dirt beside it with his hands, being careful to avoid any pieces of shattered glass that had missed the dumpster. It was harder than he expected, as the soil was packed tightly and filled with the roots of various weeds. Nonetheless, he kept going until the hole was about two hands deep. Once he was done, he grabbed the worm and dropped it in the center, before burying it under the loose pile of fine-grained soil he had just dug out. 
     
Once the hole was filled in and level, Benny sat back on his haunches and brushed off his hands. He was about to get up, but after a moment of reconsideration, he leaned back down, nearly pressing his face into the ground. 
     
“I see you,” he whispered to the worm.
     
As he climbed back to his feet, he heard the unmistakable creak of the entrance door. A sudden jolt went through him, sending him ducking behind the dumpster. Curious, and a little ashamed of his reaction, he peaked around the corner to see who was coming out.
     
It was his neighbor, Sarah. 
     
Wrapped around her was a loose, grey hoodie, which reminded him more of a blanket in the way it drooped. She had her golden hair tied up in a ponytail, and between her fingers hung an unlit cigarette. Her eyes were red and wet. Her lip was bruised.
     
Silently, she sat down on the front step. After a brief moment, she lit her cigarette and stared out into the darkness.
     
Benny wondered if she thought about funny advertisements she’d seen, or people she used to know. Maybe she thought about her job, or maybe her mother. He wondered if she ever searched her eyes in the mirror in hopes that if she waited long enough the body in front of her would suddenly transform and conform to the shape of the person she imagined herself as. He wondered if maybe, like him, she felt like the only one in the world.
     
Sarah took a drag and released a cloud of smoke. She looked cold. 
     
After a moment, she rubbed her lip and looked up, just above where Benny was hiding. At first, he thought she had spotted him, but as he traced her eye-line, he realized she was staring at the billboard.
     
“What has God seen?”
     
With a miffed sneer, she put out the cigarette and left the remaining half under the railing of the stoop. As silently as she came out, she returned inside, leaving only the creak of the door as a farewell.

Act II

___________________________
      
Benny opened the door to his apartment and flipped on the light, taking in the ravaged state of his home. 
     
There was a collection of half-drunk coffee mugs, empty soda cans, and abandoned beer bottles atop the coffee table, several of which were covered in milling ants. The trash can had been full for several days already, and he could smell it from the doorway, a heaping mass of microwavable popcorn bags and macaroni and cheese cups looming precariously over the lid, like some grotesque house of cards. His bed sat against the left wall of his shoebox, and the corner of the fitted sheet had popped off, revealing a large section of yellow mattress. The ceiling was yellow as well, stained from the years of cigarette smoke that had passed through before he moved in.
     
Benny flipped off the light and shut the door behind him. Scratching his neck, he stepped into the bathroom and leaned over the sink to splash water on his face. 
     
As he swung his head back up, he glanced in the mirror and nearly jumped. A man with a chubby, long face stared back at him from beneath a sweaty mop of brown hair. His black uniform was stained with sweat and stretched with the lumps and curves of his body. Sporadic, thin hair hung from his neck and crawled up his jaw, struggling to reach his upper lip. 
     
He left the bathroom and returned to the unseen mess of his main room. The only light left now came in through the only window, on the far end of the apartment, from the spotlights of the billboard across the street, and reflected off the dull bubble of his box television. There was a metal fold-out chair under the window, where Benny had spent countless nights staring out at the dumpster and the parking lot. It wasn’t much of a view, but he enjoyed watching the people who passed through. They reminded him of crows, gliding into the light and back out into the darkness. They were solitary creatures, only occasionally flocking together in scattered crowds, singularly united by the general direction of which they traveled. He liked to imagine where they were going, who they were. They could have been runaways, or outlaws. They might not have been anything at all.
     
With the ease of habit, he grabbed a beer and sat down on the edge of his bed, flipping on the TV. The yelling face of a news anchor filled the bubble, leaning out with the curve of the screen as though he were shouting at Benny himself. He was saying something about communism or the next generation or submarines with nuclear weapons or something like that, but Benny was too tired to care. Instead, he flipped through a few channels until he found the well-lit coffeehouse set of “Ann’s Cafe.” 
     
“Ann’s Cafe” was his favorite sitcom. It followed the hijinks of the optimistic, but naive Ann McVeal, as she tried her best to run her late parents’ cafe. Though her nutty employees often put her in some tough situations, whether through luck or ingenuity, she always found a way out. Benny found a certain comfort in that. So often, he felt like he was a boulder rolling down a hill, with no control over where he would go- no eyes to see the bottom. At least when he turned on “Ann’s Cafe,” he knew how things would end. 
     
On the television, Ann was handing coffee to George, one of her regulars. After a brief back-and-forth, she moved on to the next table, where Tony, one of her employees and often an adversary, was laying his head in his arms. 
     
“Oh…hey Tony,” she greeted to the hilarity of an invisible, laughing crowd. “What’s wrong?” 
     
“I’m the worst person in the world,” he mumbled through his arms.
     
“I’m sure you're not the worst person in the world,” she replied. The crowd laughed again. “What makes you say that?”
     
“Everywhere I go, people hate me. I have no friends. Yesterday I kicked a cat down an alleyway.” Ann made a face to the last comment, triggering another avalanche of laughter. “I think I might just be a bad guy.”
     
“Maybe you wouldn’t feel like such a bad guy if you didn’t do things like say… kick cats down alleyways.” 
     
Tony lifted his head with a comedic expression of realization.
     
“But I love kicking cats down alleyways!” he cried. “How do I just stop?”
     
“Well I can’t give you all the answers,” she returned. “But my mom always said that if someone truly wants to change, they’ll put in the work to do it!” 
     
Benny thought about Momma again. He was supposed to call her, but the idea seemed daunting. He didn’t even know why. Never once before had he dreaded a phone call with his mother. Yet, lately, it had seemed more like a chore than a conversation. He knew all the questions she would ask, and he knew all the answers he would give. Nonetheless, he felt like a traitor. 
     
Taking a sip of his beer, he tried to turn his attention back to “Ann’s Cafe.” He could tell a celebrity had made an appearance, based on the whooping and whistling of the hidden audience, but he didn’t recognize him. Nonetheless, whatever he was saying was hard to focus on, as the noises were beginning.
     
It started with a thud in the next room, behind the TV. Then he heard the boyfriend scream something, muffled by the wall.
     
“You really think I believe….and you would…God knows where... I mean how stupid are you?...Shut the fuck up!....”
     
Sarah said something, but Benny couldn’t hear it well, as she rarely yelled. 
     
“Oh is that so? You little…don’t deserve…why don’t you love me?” 
     
Sarah said something else, which must not have been the answer he was looking for, as the yelling was quickly replaced with thuds and crashes. Benny thought it would end quickly, but it didn’t. Soon, Sarah was screaming too. 
     
“Stop it! Stop it! Please stop, I love you! Please!” she sobbed.
     
Benny told himself a story. 
     
In this story, he stood up and stepped out of his apartment. He took his fist and pounded on their door, his heart thrashing against his chest. The boyfriend answered.
     
“You’re going to stop hurting Sarah,” Benny stated. 
     
The boyfriend said something in reply, like “Oh really?” or “Who do you think you are?” Whatever he said wasn’t really important.
     
Benny grabbed him and ripped him into the hallway, throwing him to the floor. The boyfriend held his hands in front of his face, but they did nothing to help him as Benny rained his fists down upon him. Each strike did more damage than the last, laying waste to his brutish features. By the time he was done, the boyfriend looked unrecognizable.
     
Benny stood up, panting. Sweat dripped from his hair. His face felt hot. With the demeanor of someone crushing an insect, he gently rolled his head over with his foot, and stepped on his windpipe.
     
Benny shook his head. Momma wouldn’t like that story. Instead, he made a new one. 
     
In this one, he took the phone from its receiver, on the nightstand beside the windowsill, and dialed 911. The woman on the other end picked up.
     
“911, what’s your emergency?”
     
“Hi, I don’t want to get anyone in trouble, or make things more difficult for them, but I heard some commotion in the room next to me. There was some yelling, and now it sounds like things might be getting violent. I just want to make sure they're okay.”
     
The operator asked a few more questions and requested he stay on the line. A few minutes later, he heard banging on his neighbors’ door, followed by “Stanton Police!” 
     
He stepped out into the hallway and watched with crossed arms as they pulled the boyfriend out in handcuffs. As they led him away, he glared at Benny with his nothing eyes, but there was nothing he could do.
     
The noises had stopped now, for the most part. He thought he could hear her crying, but it was two low to be sure. In any case, he turned up the volume on the television. 
     
It was quiet for a while after that. Soon, he finished his drink and left it on the coffee table with the rest. Not long after that, “Ann’s Cafe” came to a close. As advertisements rolled out across the screen, he returned to the fridge and grabbed another bottle. He made haste, as he didn’t want to miss the commercials either. A lot of them were funny- like the one for pet food with the talking dog.
     
Eventually, the advertisements ended, and some other sitcom he was half-invested in replaced them. As he sank further and further into the golden bubbles of his second drink, his eyes grew heavier and heavier, and soon he had found himself suspended within that peculiar valley that cut between dream and reality. 
     
Yet, the silence wouldn't last.
     
A few hours later, Benny awoke to a shriek. The noise was unlike anything he’d heard before, like the dying cry of an injured animal. It sounded like they were trying to say a word, like “stop” or “no,” but all that came out was some primal bark. 
     
Only too late did Benny realize that he wasn’t dreaming, and that the voice was Sarah’s.
     
There came a deafening bang.
     
Then silence.

Act III

___________________

     
Benny sat in the chair by the window, staring out at the dumpster and the billboard.
     
The television played quietly behind him as he held his hand on the phone, his fingers trembling. He’d expected to see the red and blue lights of police cars fill his window long before now, but no one came. He figured someone would at least call in a complaint to the front desk after the buzzing of the saw started, but that was hours ago, and now only silence haunted the halls. 
     
Down the street, the man on the bike rode in circles in the gas station parking lot, presumably quoting scripture to himself. The roads were empty, and the sidewalks were vacant. The metal creatures of the construction zone remained still in their slumber. Benny scratched his neck.
     
He didn't understand why this was such a hard choice. He knew what had happened. He knew who did it. Yet, his hand still remained frozen on the handset. The longer he stared at it, the more it felt like an entity in itself- like at any moment it might speak to him, or rise from its receiver and wrap its cord around his neck. 
     
He thought of Sarah. Her wheat-stalk hair. Her red, leaking eyes. He wondered what she felt now; if she was scared, if she was cold, if she felt anything. He supposed she didn’t, or rather couldn’t, but he was well adept at pretending. 
    
Benny shut his eyes tightly, then picked up the phone. The dial tone played from the speaker as he dialed in the number, his heart beating like a jackhammer. After a moment, it began to ring.
     
There came a click from the other end.
     
“Hello?” a confused voice croaked from the other end.
    
“Hi Momma,” Benny replied.
     
“Oh hello sweetheart! What are you doing up so late?”
     
“Just watching TV.”
     
“Is it that ‘Ann’s Cafe’ show you always talk about?”
     
“No, it’s uh… I don’t know what show this is.”
     
Both of them fell silent for a moment.
     
“I’m sorry if I woke you up, I just needed to talk to you,” Benny apologized.
     
“Is something wrong?”
     
“No.”
    
“If something is wrong, you can tell me.”
     
“Nothing’s wrong Momma. I just… I know I promised to call you tonight.”
     
“Oh okay. How was your day?”
     
“It was good.”
     
“How was work?”
     
“It was good.”
     
“Anything interesting happen?”
     
“No.”
     
“Did you talk to that girl next door…Sarah?”
     
“No…no, I don’t think I’m going to be hearing from her much anymore.”
    
Benny heard the door creak through the glass. The boyfriend walked out from below him, wearing his white T-shirt and grey sweatpants. He was hauling two oddly shaped trash bags over his shoulder, which seemed much heavier than normal. Benny felt sick. 
     
“Well I’m sorry to hear that. From what you told me, it sounded like you had something going there. But I’m sure you’ll find someone. Any girl would be lucky to have you.”
     
The boyfriend crossed the parking lot.  About halfway across, he stumbled and dropped one of the bags. A look of panic tore through his face as the drawstrings came loose, letting Benny catch a glimpse of blonde hair. He gently placed the other bag on the asphalt and tightened the first, choosing to drag it the rest of the way instead. 
     
Benny looked back up at the billboard.
     
“What has God seen?”
     
He wondered who had paid for that message. Did they leave it as a warning? An accusation? Or were they genuinely asking in hopes that some righteous vandal would climb up there and write the answer?
     
“I saved a worm today,” Benny said suddenly.
     
“Oh yeah?”
     
“Yeah. It was in the middle of the parking lot. It was cold out, and it looked like it was dying, so I buried it by the dumpster. I have no idea what it was doing out there. Did you know that worms hibernate in the winter?”
     
“No, I never heard that. That's really sweet of you though! You’ve always been so caring.”
     
Both of them fell silent again.
     
The boyfriend tossed the first bag into the dumpster.
     
“Momma?” Benny asked.
    
“Yeah?”
     
“Do you think I’m a good person?”
     
“Of course I do!”
     
“I have to go now Momma. I love you.”
     
“I love you too…Is everything okay?”
     
Benny hung up the phone.
     
Outside, the boyfriend was lugging the second bag to the dumpster. Benny stood up and watched as he lifted it up to his shoulder and over the lip of the dumpster. Without so much as a second glance, he turned and made his way back to the door. As he walked, he looked up at the building, and made eye contact with Benny.
     
A shudder passed through him. The creature smiled casually, boring into his eyes with its empty, black coals.
    
 It waved.
     
Benny waved back.
     
Then it went inside. 
     
Benny remained there in the window for a while, watching. He considered the dumpster, where he had hidden hours before to watch his neighbor smoke a cigarette. Then, he lifted his eyes to the billboard again, where Sarah had spent countless nights staring at its ominous simplicity. 
     
“What has God seen?”
     
It was there, within the dumpster and beneath the blind eyes of God, that he left her… 
     
“Ann’s Cafe” just started again..

I have a cat who is just under two years old. I got her at around 3 months old and she was fully litter trained when she came home. About a month later she started having occasional accidents on my bed. Over time, this became worse and she eventually stopped using the litter tray completely. She is also spayed.

Since then, she has peed and pooped in various places around the house First the sofa, then the front door mat, then piles of clothes and even the coffee table. At the moment, she will usually go in a plastic bag if we place one on the table which we can then throw away, but there are still occasional accidents on the sofa.

I’ve finally managed to book a vet appointment for soon so she can be checked medically. I know this was left FAR too long, and I completely understand how bad that sounds but I want to be upfront that I am a child and rely on my family for transport and vet bills. This is a family cat that my brother got and I’ve been raising this issue since it started but I genuinely couldn’t do anything on my own. I'm from the UK if that helps.

Ever Clean clumping litter
Several different pellet litters
Cardboard litter
Wood litter

1q97bs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1q97bs0/our_fomo_baby_fell_deep_asleep_in_15_seconds/,Our FOMO baby fell deep asleep in 15 seconds!,"I'm astonished.

Yesterday I was crying all day basically breaking down over how hard it is to have a FOMO baby that fight every.single.nap smd screams like her limbs are being ripped off while she's on fire for 30 minutes up to 4 hours when we try to put her down for a nap.

She only naps in the carrier during the day. She's 12w and it's been like this for 7 weeks everyday now. So Yesterday I was reading aboit everyone else's suggestions for FOMO babies and sleeping because the general advise about sticking to wake windows have NOT worked. At all. Someone in one comment saud they just went with the flow so today I tried a new method.

I played with her, walked around with her in a ringsling showing her stuff, read to her, changed her diaper twice, fed her twice, talked and sang a bunch, held her up on her stomach alot playing ""airplane"" and went to the neighbours and had a coffee and cake while talking to them and their kids (2+5) and let my baby get extremely stimulated and social, being part of the table group etc.

Then once she started crying after 2hrs and 45min of being awake - I walked back to our place, went into our ""dark room"" opened the window for it to cool and held her head on my collar bone gently and was ready to start shushing.

It went ""sh.."" and she was asleep. No noises is waking up her now.

What is this black magic?

Seriously from now on i won't follow the recommended wake windows because she sleeps less with those and always wakes up 15-30min later.

Now she has slept for hours.

I'm so happy and maybe...
Just maybe if someone else have a baby similar to ours - this tactic might be worth a try? ",1,1768059931.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False
1q97bi0,https://drbrc.in/treatments/cancer,"Cancer Treatment at Dr BRC Clinic, Dr Biswaroop Guidance","The diagnosis of cancer is often met with a whirlwind of fear, aggressive interventions, and a feeling of powerlessness. In the landscape of alternative medicine in India, **Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury (BRC)** has introduced a controversial yet highly popular ""drug-free"" protocol for cancer. This approach, centered at **FitN (Fit Naturopathy)**, pivots away from chemotherapy and radiation, focusing instead on nutritional mathematics and biological clock alignment.

Here is an in-depth exploration of the Dr. BRC cancer treatment philosophy, the specific protocols involved, and the necessary medical context.

# The Core Philosophy: ""The Rabbit and Tortoise Model"" 🐢🐇

Dr. BRC often uses the ""Rabbit-Tortoise"" analogy to explain his view on cancer. In this model, the **Rabbit** represents aggressive, fast-growing tumors that often require urgent attention, while the **Tortoise** represents indolent, slow-growing masses that he claims the body can manage or ""reverse"" if given the right environment.

The fundamental belief at the clinic is that cancer is not a ""death sentence"" but a symptom of a highly acidic, inflamed, and toxic internal environment. The goal of the treatment is to change the ""soil"" (the body) so the ""seed"" (the cancer) can no longer grow.

  
**The ""Soil and Seed"" Theory**

Think of a tumor as a weed. Conventional treatment cuts the weed (surgery) or poisons it (chemo). But if the soil remains acidic and toxic, the weed will grow back.

Our approach focuses on changing the soil. Cancer cells thrive in specific conditions:

* **Acidic Environment:** Cancer cells struggle to survive in alkaline blood (pH 7.4).
* **Low Oxygen (Hypoxia):** As discovered by Nobel Laureate Otto Warburg, cancer cells use fermentation (sugar) for energy in the absence of oxygen.
* **High Sugar (Glucose):** Sugar is the primary fuel for rapid cell division.



# The Protocol: The 4 Pillars of Healing

The treatment at HIIMS and under Dr. BRC’s guidance generally revolves around four main scientific and natural interventions.

# 1. The DIP Diet (Nutritional Therapy) 🍎

The primary ""medicine"" prescribed is the **DIP Diet (Disciplined and Intelligent Person's Diet)**. For cancer patients, this is strictly plant-based and emphasizes raw enzymes.

* **Step 1 (Until 12 PM):** Only seasonal fruits. The quantity is calculated as BodyWeight(kg)×10=grams.
* **Step 2 (Lunch/Dinner):** A two-plate system.
   * **Plate 1:** Raw vegetables/salad (BodyWeight×5=grams).
   * **Plate 2:** Whole-grain, home-cooked vegetarian food.
   * *Rule:* Plate 1 must be finished first to prime the gut with live enzymes and fibers that act as ""biological scavengers.""

# 2. The GRAD System (Gravitational Resistance and Diet) 🛁

Initially designed for kidney failure, the **GRAD system** is used in cancer care to boost immunity and detoxification.

* **Hot Water Immersion (HWI):** Patients sit in water at 40∘C for specific durations. This is claimed to induce ""Heat Shock Proteins"" (HSPs), which Dr. BRC suggests can help the immune system identify and target cancer cells.
* **Head-Down Tilt (HDT):** Using gravity to improve blood flow to vital organs and the lymphatic system.

# 3. Zero-Volt Earthing (Inflammation Control) ⚡

Chronic inflammation is a driver of cancer. The protocol involves **Earthing**—connecting the body to the earth's surface using a conductive mat or copper wire. This is intended to neutralize free radicals by absorbing electrons from the earth, theoretically reducing systemic inflammation.

# 4. Circadian Clock Alignment ☀️

Cancer cells thrive in a disorganized biological environment. The clinic mandates a strict schedule:

* **Sunlight:** Minimum 30–45 minutes of morning sun for Vitamin D and melatonin regulation.
* **Sunset Dinner:** Finishing the last meal of the day by 6:00 PM or 7:00 PM to ensure the body focuses on ""cellular repair"" during sleep rather than digestion.

# Integrated Ayurvedic Therapies at HIIMS

While Dr. BRC provides the nutritional and physical protocols, the **HIIMS** hospitals (co-founded with Acharya Manish) integrate traditional Ayurvedic detox:

* **Panchakarma:** Vamana (emesis) and Virechana (purgation) to remove ""Ama"" (toxins).
* **Golden Therapy:** Use of specialized herbal pastes (including Neem, Turmeric, and Bitter Gourd) applied topically or taken internally to maintain alkalinity.
* **Specific Herbs:** High doses of Curcumin (Turmeric), Ashwagandha (to manage stress), and Giloy (for immunity).

# Intellectual Honesty & The Medical Debate ⚖️

It is crucial to balance this information with the perspective of the global medical community. Dr. BRC’s methods are highly polarized:

* **Lack of Peer-Review:** Most of Dr. BRC’s claims regarding ""reversing"" late-stage cancer have not been validated in large-scale, peer-reviewed clinical trials.
* **The ""Honorary"" Status:** Dr. BRC is not a medical doctor (MBBS/Oncologist). His PhD is honorary, and he has faced legal scrutiny for his views on modern medicine.
* **The Risk of Delay:** Mainstream oncologists warn that choosing ""natural-only"" paths for aggressive (Rabbit) cancers can lead to a delay in life-saving treatments like surgery or targeted therapy, during which the cancer may metastasize.

>

# The ""Hospital at Home"" Approach

One unique aspect of this movement is the **VOPD (Virtual Outpatient Department)**. Recognizing that cancer patients are often too weak to travel, the clinic offers a 1-year ""Clinic@Home"" program where ""WISE"" experts guide the family through setting up the diet, earthing, and water therapies in their own house.

  
When treating cancer under the Dr. BRC protocol, the strategy shifts from ""attacking the tumor"" to ""correcting the environment."" This involves a strict list of forbidden items that are believed to feed cancer cells or create an acidic, inflammatory environment.

# 🚫 The ""Absolute No"" List (Cancer Protocol)

Dr. BRC’s protocol mandates the complete removal of several categories of food and lifestyle habits. If you are following this for cancer, these are typically considered non-negotiable:

# 1. Animal Products (The Protein-Growth Link)

Dr. BRC argues that animal protein (casein in milk and IGF-1 in meat) acts as fuel for tumor growth.

* **Dairy:** No milk, curd, paneer, ghee, or butter.
* **Meat/Poultry:** No chicken, red meat, or processed meats (sausages/salami).
* **Fish & Eggs:** All animal-derived proteins are excluded.

# 2. Refined & Factory-Made Foods

Anything that comes in a packet, box, or can is prohibited because of preservatives and the high glycemic index.

* **White Sugar & Flour:** No refined sugar, maida, biscuits, or bread.
* **Refined Oils:** No industrially processed vegetable oils.
* **Packaged Snacks:** No chips, namkeens, or instant noodles.

# 3. High-Sodium & Chemical Additives

* **Iodized Salt:** Only minimal amounts of Saindha Namak (Himalayan Pink Salt) are usually permitted.
* **Tea/Coffee:** Caffeine is discouraged as it disrupts the circadian rhythm and dehydrates the body.
* **Alcohol & Tobacco:** Strictly forbidden due to their direct carcinogenic nature.

  
Since the **DIP Diet** and the **GRAD System** are the pillars of this treatment, here is a detailed daily schedule and a specialized grocery list tailored for a cancer protocol.

# ⏰ The Cancer Protocol: Daily Schedule

This schedule is designed to maximize cellular repair and synchronize your biological clock.

* **05:00 AM – 06:00 AM:** **Wake Up & Earthing.** Walk barefoot on grass or sit on an Earthing mat for 30–60 minutes.
* **07:00 AM – 08:00 AM:** **Sunlight & Yoga.** Exposure to direct sunlight is vital. Practice light *Pranayama* (breathing exercises) to oxygenate the blood.
* **08:00 AM – 12:00 PM:** **Fruit Window.** Consume 3 to 4 types of seasonal fruits.
   * *Calculation:* Weight(kg)×10=grams (e.g., a 70kg person eats 700g of fruit).
* **12:00 PM – 01:30 PM:** **Lunch (The Two-Plate Rule).**
   * **Plate 1:** Raw vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, and radish (Weight×5=grams).
   * **Plate 2:** Home-cooked, oil-free, salt-free (or low Saindha salt) millets or brown rice.
* **02:00 PM – 04:00 PM:** **Hot Water Immersion (HWI).** If recommended by the clinic, sit in a tub of 40∘C water for 40–60 minutes to stimulate immunity.
* **05:00 PM – 06:00 PM:** **Dinner.** Repeat the Two-Plate Rule. **Must finish before sunset.**
* **09:00 PM:** **Sleep.** Deep sleep in a dark room to allow for melatonin production and cellular detoxification.

# 🛒 The ""Healing Kitchen"" Grocery List

To follow this protocol effectively, your kitchen needs to be stocked with ""Living Foods.""

|**Category**|**What to Buy**|**What to Avoid**|

**⚠️ Important Checklist Before Starting**

1. **Baseline Blood Tests:** Before starting, get a complete CBC, KFT, LFT, and Tumor Marker test (as advised by your oncologist) so you can track progress objectively after 3 months.
2. **Gradual Tapering:** If you are on heavy medication, do not stop them abruptly. Consult a HIIMS doctor or an integrated specialist to taper doses safely as your parameters improve.
3. **Hydration:** Stick to structured water or copper-vessel water. Avoid plastic bottled water.

In the Dr. BRC and HIIMS protocol, **Green Juices** are treated as ""living liquid medicine."" They are intended to provide a concentrated burst of chlorophyll, enzymes, and phytonutrients to help alkalize the blood and support the liver in flushing out toxins.

Here are the specific green juice recipes and ingredients frequently recommended for cancer patients under this protocol:

# 1. The ""Ultimate Dr BRC Detox"" Green Juice 🌿

This is the most common formula. It combines potent Ayurvedic leaves with blood-purifying vegetables.

* **Ingredients:**
   * **Neem Leaves (10-12):** Known as ""Nature’s Pharmacy"" for blood purification.
   * **Paan (Betel) Leaves (3-4):** Believed to boost vitality and aid digestion.
   * **Peepal & Banyan Leaves (2 each):** Specifically mentioned by Acharya for chronic conditions like cancer.
   * **Fresh Coriander & Mint:** For cooling the body and reducing inflammation.
   * **Raw Turmeric (1 inch):** A powerful anti-inflammatory agent.
   * **Ginger (1 inch):** To stimulate digestive fire (*Agni*).
* **Preparation:** Blend all ingredients with a little water and strain through a muslin cloth. Drink fresh on an empty stomach.

# 2. Ash Gourd (Petha) Juice: The ""Cooling Healer"" 🍈

This juice is a cornerstone of the BRC protocol because of its high alkalinity and hydration properties (96% water). It is used to ""cool down"" the internal heat (*Pitta*) often associated with cancer and aggressive treatments.

* **Ingredients:** 250–500g of fresh Ash Gourd (Pulp and seeds).
* **Benefits:** Helps in dissolving ""internal lumps"" and flushing the kidneys.
* **Protocol:** Best consumed early morning. Avoid eating anything for at least 2–3 hours after drinking this to allow for deep cellular cleansing.

# 3. Wheatgrass Juice: ""Green Blood"" 🌱

Dr. BRC and many natural practitioners emphasize wheatgrass because its molecular structure is nearly identical to human hemoglobin (the only difference being a Magnesium atom instead of Iron).

* **Ingredients:** Freshly harvested 7-to-9-day-old wheatgrass.
* **Dose:** Start with 30ml and gradually increase to 60ml daily.
* **Purpose:** To oxygenate the blood. Cancer cells are anaerobic (thrive in low-oxygen environments); providing high oxygen levels is believed to inhibit their growth.

# 4. The ""Karela-Amla"" Immunity Booster 🥒

For those dealing with metabolic issues or tumors related to hormonal imbalances, this bitter juice is often prescribed.

* **Ingredients:**
   * **Karela (Bitter Gourd):** 1 small.
   * **Amla (Indian Gooseberry):** 2 pieces (rich in Vitamin C).
   * **Giloy (Heart-leaved Moonseed):** A 2-inch stick or juice (the ultimate Ayurvedic immunity herb).
* **Purpose:** To detoxify the liver and strengthen the body’s natural defense against abnormal cell growth.

# 5. Red-Green Vitality Juice (Hemoglobin Booster) 🍎

If the patient is suffering from anemia or weakness (common during chemotherapy), this juice is added to the afternoon routine.

* **Ingredients:** 1 Beetroot + 2 Carrots + 1 Apple + Handful of Spinach + Squeeze of Lemon.
* **Purpose:** To increase hemoglobin and iron levels naturally without the need for synthetic supplements.

# ⚠️ Crucial Implementation Tips

1. **Freshness is Key:** These juices lose their enzymatic value within 15–20 minutes. They should be consumed immediately after extraction.
2. **No Slow Juicers/Centrifugals if possible:** Use a traditional stone mortar or a high-powered blender and strain with a cloth to keep the ""Prana"" (life force) intact.
3. **Sip, Don't Gulp:** Mix the juice with saliva by sipping it slowly. This initiates digestion in the mouth.
4. **Listen to your Gut:** If a particular juice causes nausea (common with wheatgrass), reduce the quantity or dilute it with more water.



To help you manage these ""liquid medicines"" without getting overwhelmed, here is a structured **7-Day Juice Rotation Calendar**. This variety ensures you aren't overloading on one specific herb while getting a full spectrum of antioxidants and minerals.

# 📅 7-Day Juice Rotation Calendar

This plan assumes the juice is taken in the **early morning (empty stomach)** or as a **mid-morning snack (10:30 AM)**.

|**Day**|**Primary Juice**|**Purpose**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Monday**|**Ash Gourd (Petha) Juice**|Systemic alkalization and kidney flush.|
|**Tuesday**|**Ultimate HIIMS Detox** (Neem/Paan/Peepal)|Intensive blood purification and anti-parasitic action.|
|**Wednesday**|**Wheatgrass Juice** (30-60ml)|Oxygenating the blood and boosting hemoglobin.|
|**Thursday**|**Karela-Amla-Giloy**|Liver detoxification and immune system ""reset.""|
|**Friday**|**Ash Gourd (Petha) Juice**|Re-hydrating and cooling the digestive tract.|
|**Saturday**|**Red-Green Vitality** (Beet/Carrot/Spinach)|Building strength and replenishing micronutrients.|
|**Sunday**|**Wheatgrass Juice**|Deep cellular repair and energy boost.|

# 🌿 Tips for Sourcing the Ingredients

If you are in **Lucknow**, sourcing these ""living"" ingredients is relatively easy:

* **Peepal/Banyan/Neem Leaves:** These are usually available in local parks or temple vicinities. Ensure you pick them from a height (away from road dust/pollution) and wash them thoroughly in salt water.
* **Ash Gourd:** Look for ""Safed Petha"" at the Mandi (like Dubagga or Naveen Galla Mandi). It should feel heavy for its size.
* **Wheatgrass:** It is best to grow this at home in 7 small trays to ensure it is organic and fresh.

# 📋 The ""Golden Rules"" of Juice Therapy

To ensure these juices work as ""medicine"" and not just ""food,"" follow these three rules:

1. **The 15-Minute Rule:** Once extracted, the enzymes begin to die due to oxidation. Drink the juice within 15 minutes of making it.
2. **The Saliva Rule:** Do not drink it like water. Take a sip, swish it in your mouth for 5–10 seconds to mix with saliva (which contains digestive enzymes), and then swallow.
3. **The Temperature Rule:** Never add ice. Drink the juice at room temperature to keep your ""Digestive Fire"" (*Jatharagni*) active.

# Conclusion

Dr. BRC’s cancer protocol is a lifestyle-heavy approach that challenges the traditional ""attack the tumor"" mindset, favoring a ""heal the body"" strategy. For some, it offers a beacon of hope for a dignified, drug-free life; for others, it is a risky departure from proven science.

If you or a loved one are considering this path, it is always recommended to keep your primary oncologist informed to ensure a safe, integrated approach to your health.

I’m an ex timmies employee, I started in 2020 I think and quit in 2023. My concern is that the quality drop off from then to now has become excruciatingly noticeable. I’ve been a frequent customer for quite some time now and usually I’ll get a coffee on the way to work or school.

This might end up being a long post but there’s 2 things in particular I want to address:

1. Lack of customer service 

2. Extreme inconsistency in orders

Firstly, customer service has gone down the drain. I’m not usually one to even care about how the employees are(I used to be one so I understand), like as long as they are semi polite and my order is correct and the transaction goes smoothly I’m fine. However it’s gotten to a point where they are just genuinely rude. They don’t treat customers like people and the second you get in the drive thru their main concern is just getting you out as quickly as possible. Sometimes I’ll go to a drive thru and at the speaker all I get is a “Yes”, “drive up” and at the window they can’t even make eye contact and just shove the machine in my face. I usually pay with scan and pay so I’ll have that ready as I drive up and as soon as I show it to them they make a face because now they have to cancel the transaction on their machine. Again like I said, I don’t care as long as my order is right which leads me to my second point:

THE ORDER IS NEVER RIGHT. I’ve cycled through multiple “regular” orders in the past and every time I change up my order it’s because I feel like they aren’t competent enough to get it right. I used to get a caramel iced coffee with extra cane sugar and espresso foam. Every single time I got it, there was like a 10% chance it would taste the way I wanted it to. Sometimes not sweet enough, sometimes there’s too much cream, sometimes they don’t put ice, sometimes the espresso foam is weird and chunky (not even like foam just feels like spoiled milk), sometimes they forget the espresso foam altogether and when I ask them to fix it they drizzle a little bit on top as if I’m not paying a WHOLE EXTRA DOLLAR for it. I eventually changed my order to an iced Capp with caramel shot. This time, half the time I’d get a melted iced Capp. Basically watered down. Now this is a fault with the machine and not really the employee, but I don’t remember why it would happen however I’m sure there’s a way to calibrate it. Now finally, I switched to a caramel cold brew with cane sugar. Again, same thing, the one location I go to makes it wrong every time. They rarely ever put cane sugar, and for some reason my coffee just tastes like milk with some caramel. Yesterday I was going to work and got a bad coffee, went back later to a different store to change it, and even the replacement was awful.

Popularized by horror writer H.P. Lovecraft and validated by modern astrophysics, Cosmic Nihilism is the realization that the universe is not just ""meaningless""—it is incomprehensibly vast, deeply hostile to biological life, and entirely indifferent to our existence.

At first glance, this is terrifying. But if you look at the data logically, it is actually the ultimate permission slip.

# 1. The Definition: What is it?

Religious worldviews place Humanity at the center of the story. God created the stage *for us*. The stars are there *for us*. Cosmic Nihilism argues the opposite: **We are accidental moss growing on a wet rock in a forgotten corner of a hostile galaxy.**

The universe was not made for us. In fact, most of the universe (vacuum, radiation, black holes) would kill us instantly. We are an anomaly, not the protagonist.

# 2. The Evidence: The Science of Irrelevance

You don't need philosophy to prove Cosmic Nihilism. You just need a telescope and a calculator.

* **The Scale of Space:** The observable universe contains roughly 2 trillion galaxies. Each galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars. If you shrink the sun down to the size of a white blood cell, the Milky Way galaxy would still be the size of the continental United States. Earth is invisible in this model. To believe the Creator of *that* cares about who you sleep with or what flag you salute is the height of arrogance.
* **The Scale of Time (The Cosmic Calendar):** If the history of the universe (13.8 billion years) were compressed into a single calendar year: We have existed for the last 8 minutes of the year. We are a rounding error in deep time.
   * The Big Bang is Jan 1st.
   * Earth forms in September.
   * Dinosaurs die on Dec 25th.
   * **Modern Humans evolve at 11:52 PM on December 31st.**
* **Entropy (The Heat Death):** The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy (disorder) always increases. Eventually, all stars will burn out, black holes will evaporate, and the universe will reach a state of absolute zero energy. Nothing we build, write, or conquer will survive. The final score is always Zero.

# 3. The Liberation: Why this is Good News

So, we are small, temporary, and doomed. Why isn't this depressing?

**Because it means you are free.**

* **No Divine Pressure:** If the universe doesn't care about you, it isn't judging you. There is no cosmic scoreboard. You don't have a ""destiny"" you are failing to fulfill.
* **Perspective on Pain:** Did you embarrass yourself at work? Did you fail a test? Did your relationship end?
   * *The Religious View:* ""This is part of God's plan/Karma."" (High pressure).
   * *The Cosmic View:* ""I am a primate on a rock orbiting a dying star. Nothing I do matters in the grand scheme."" (Zero pressure).
* **The Ego Check:** Cosmic Nihilism destroys the ego. It stops you from taking yourself so seriously. It allows you to enjoy a cup of coffee or a sunset simply because it feels good, not because it serves a higher purpose.

**Conclusion:** You are not the main character. You are not the chosen one. You are a ghost in the machine of a uncaring cosmos. **So stop worrying and enjoy the ride.**

# 📌 [Mod Note] Sources & Concepts

To ground this philosophical discussion in fact, here are the scientific concepts referenced above:

**1. The Cosmic Calendar**

* **Origin:** Popularized by Carl Sagan in the series *Cosmos*.
* **The Data:** It visualizes the chronology of the universe (13.8 billion years) to demonstrate the extreme youth of the human species.

**2. The Great Indifference (Lovecraftian Horror)**

* **Concept:** H.P. Lovecraft’s fiction (e.g., *Call of Cthulhu*) was pioneering not because of ""monsters,"" but because it introduced the idea that the ""Gods"" (Old Ones) weren't evil—they just didn't notice us, the same way we don't notice ants when we build a highway.
* **Scientific Parallel:** This mirrors the **Fermi Paradox** (The Great Silence)—the unsettling lack of evidence for extraterrestrial civilizations despite the high probability of their existence.

**3. The Second Law of Thermodynamics**

* **The Fact:** Entropy of an isolated system never decreases. This implies that the universe is moving irreversibly toward a state of maximum disorder (Heat Death/Big Freeze). This is the physical proof that ""permanence"" is an illusion.

**Discussion:** Does the realization of your insignificance make you feel anxious (Existential Dread) or relieved (Optimistic Nihilism)?",1,1768059699.0,SecularChaos,0,1.0,False

but in louder places like busy restaurants, group talks where everyone speaks at once, or fast-moving conversations, the performance drops with more lag, missed words, or trouble picking up voices. they're also not like hearing aids, they need a charged phone nearby via Bluetooth, good internet for the best results, and battery life seems to be around 3-5 hours of active captioning (with quick recharges).

I built this Watch first app called ‘**Caffeine Curfew**’ because I kept wrecking my sleep schedule by drinking coffee and pre workout way too late in the day. I hated that most other apps locked their watch version behind a paywall.

It basically calculates a hard stop time for your caffeine intake based on your bedtime, so you know exactly when to switch to water. It also helps you analyze your sleep and make better habits when it comes to rest and productivity. 

It's built with SwiftUI and SwiftData, and it syncs fully with HealthKit. The biggest engineering problem I faced was getting the 3 way hand shake sync to work correctly between the watch, widgets, and main app.

I am a microbiology student - and admittedly live in bad conditions. Constantly have old beer cans / coffee cups in my room, desk and bathroom growing a ton of mold for months at a time. Never thought anything of it, until we discussed aflotoxin exposure in food chains in a recent class.

Got me thinking about if I have been exposed via airborne pathways. Been about 5 years of squaller living (not here for judgement). 

 So two parts to the question

1) can someone help explain aflotoxins in a much simpler way? Are they present on all spores, are they a compound that grows on a mold colony, etc.

2) by living where I’m constantly around moldy beer cans, coffee cups, etc. - am I exposed to a dangerous amount of aflotoxins? Is there a way I could get tested?

My husband retired early from a professional career and has recently started working for a start up. I’ve been totally supportive of him. He doesn’t work 9-5 but has to travel and has meetings throughout the day. 

I have been a stay at home mom to our 3 year old, who attends preschool 2 days a week. 

My husband has always had a habit of falling asleep on the couch late at night (I go to bed a little earlier) after watching TV and then either comes into our bed during the middle of the night or just sleeps through on the couch. Prior to having a child and our child being aware, this was something I just sort of let happen but now it’s starting to impact the family unit. 

My husband will stay up late watching TV or doom scrolling and then is sleeping in sometimes until noon the next day. He will leave his snacks out and dirty dishes on the coffee table. Our son is aware of this and will sometimes be playing around his sleeping body. I have tried to be supportive and voice my concerns that he may be depressed or should get bloodwork done if he is really that tired. He always says “yeah I just need to be more consistent” or “maybe I am depressed” but never does anything about it. 

I’m starting to reach my breaking point as I feel that I never truly get the same amount of rest as he does (I could only sleep in until like 8:30 max but still). I don’t even want the same “time off” as him I’d just love a Saturday where I can clean the house or organize and be off duty for it. And though it’s not tit for tat - I carry all the mental load of the house (cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking and cleaning up meals, appointments, shopping, calling people to come fix things at the house, etc) I’m starting to feel lonely and disconnected from him. Some days when he wakes up I don’t even have much to say to him. 

My son tries to wake him up and he won’t wake up unless it’s for work or for an obligation he made. I’m starting to feel like we aren’t worth it to him and I never thought I’d voice that.

I have every intention of talking to him about this. I guess I just needed an outlet to process it prior to bringing it up. We’ve touched on it in the past and I’ve tried to be patient as he has definitely carried the family unit through tough seasons of life for me. But it’s been going on for so long that I’m losing some patience.

Yes I'm crushing on this person, but I just wanted to build on our friendship because I don't think there's anything romantic ever to come out of this, and I'm okay with that. I would just like to become better friends. Less work friends more actual friends.

So yesterday, knowing we have a group event coming up, I asked if she wanted to grab a coffee beforehand, and she immediately logged off.

I'm taking that as a sign she does not want to grab a coffee next week, but having that unanswered msg out there over the weekend is gonna be on my mind, and I'm dreading the response, even with knowing she's probably gonna politely decline on Monday.

I feel so stupid. I've been considering  her my friend for these last couple years. Like a legit friend. Not just a work friend. And friends wouldn't immediately log off when they get a msg from a friend. Now I'm stressed thinking she always was just polite, and she possibly thinks I'm a creep that isn't leaving her alone. Feeling like I've made a huge mistake just asking if someone wants a cup of coffee. Like we both get along great, she's always laughing  when we talk on person, we use heart emojis all the time when we chat, coffee should be an ok ask, right?

I struggle with creating my own routine, and would love advice from the community. Here are some issues I’m having:

- If I don’t take my meds as soon as I get up I forget, take them about 10 and am not really good at work until like 11 ish. If I take them as soon as I get up, I don’t eat breakfast (if I’m lucky, banana and coffee). Then feel sick later in the day.

- Once I’m working I work continuously until I can’t anymore, and then am exhausted. Repeat.

- I’m trying to figure out how to fit in the gym and feeding myself. I find I either have a day with lots of work and eat badly and don’t go to gym, or I take great care of myself and fit in about 2 hours of billable work (I have contracts where I bill hourly).

Examples with software on physical:

I can type fast enough on a real keyboard that the text essentially appears on screen straight from my mind, but a touch keyboard is harder to use and doesn't feel like it has different buttons and they're all close and it changes words and using it makes me feel stupid, less than, and like since they control everything and knows everything in my mind already, it feels like the government/Google is mocking me.

I’ve got a solid social life. Mixed friend group, male and female friends, people genuinely like me.

I ask them out in a low pressure, clear but respectful. “Hey, would you like to grab a coffee sometime?” or “I’ve enjoyed talking to you, want to go for a drink this week?” No trauma dumping, no desperation..

“I just want to be friends.”  
“You’re a great guy, just not in that way.”

So at some point you stop asking “am I doing *anything* wrong?” and start asking “what’s the thing no one ever says out loud?” Because the advice is always the same recycled stuff *just be yourself*, *focus on yourself*, *it happens when you least expect it*, *you’re not entitled to anything*  and sure, all of that is technically true, but it’s not very useful when you’re doing all of it already and still getting the same outcome on repeat.

I was recently promoted to house manager, so I now supervise him. Nothing physical or sexual has happened between us (no dates, hookups, or confessions), but there's been a long build-up of moments that feel emotionally and physically charged, and I'm having trouble telling whether this is mutual attraction or just a good coworker relationship.

Some background: He told me he didn't like me at first and thought I was bossy. Over time, he said he saw how I work, how much I care, and that he grew to respect me deeply. He's also said we're not friends, just coworkers, but that he has my back and respects me a lot.

However, there are several moments that stand out to me that have me confused.

1. The morning I found out I got promoted, when he walked in for his shift, the first thing he did was look at me with a silent ""did you get it?"" expression. He was the reason I ultimately applied for the position, after he gave me several motivational speeches about how perfect I am for the role. I replied to this look with a smile and nod. He grinned and said ""alright!"" and seemed genuinely excited, probably more than I was.
2. During my first staff meeting as manager, I thanked everyone for supporting me. When I asked if anyone had anything to add, he spoke up and said he was proud of me, that he's seen my struggles and growth, and that he has a lot of respect and admiration for me. I visibly blushed. He smiled warmly and nodded at me afterward.
3. He often calls me ""manager"" or ""Lady"", always smiling when he says it.
4. One day he told me he missed me when I hadn't been around much.
5. He moved his phone and cup of coffee off my desk ""to be respectful"".
6. When we run errands together, silence between us is comfortable, not awkward, but it often feels charged.
7. While at a store, he placed his hand on the small of my back and gently guided me toward the registers, keeping his hand there for several seconds
8. Another time in the work van, while waiting for a car to move, he rested his hand on the back of my headrest near my head. I know this is the proper way you're supposed to back out of a parking spot, but the energy radiating from him felt so electric and charged that I couldn't even look at him
9. He insists on paying for small things even when I say I'll pay, saying things like ""I wasn't asking, I'm telling you I'm paying for it.""
10. He's bought me snacks or food just so I could try them and watches me when I taste it to see my reaction.
11. He takes charge when we're in stores, insisting on carrying all of the bags, actively helping find what we're looking for, having me wait so he can figure out where things are, and physically guiding me around the store (I get overstimulated in stores and he knows this)
12. He notices when I'm stressed and steps in to help, once leaning over me to try to fix a computer issue when I was getting frustrated.
13. He's opened up about personal things over time, like his home life growing up and the struggles he's faced. There was clear vulnerability and trust there.
14. We joke easily, laugh together in stores and in the car, and the energy feels warm, close, and intentional
15. Once, I told him about a former coworker who I hooked up with. This coworker is significantly older than me. He said ""It's only about looks when you're like in your 20s. Once you're in your 30s and 40s it's about the person's heart and who they are on the inside."" He then said ""I'm just surprised because his personality doesn't seem like your type."" I said ""Yeah well the mistakes we make when we're drunk and lonely."" He chuckled and said ""So a drink is all it takes for you, huh?"" When we got back to the house, he said, ""Well thank you for trusting me enough to share that with me. Just let me know if you want to get drinks sometime."" I don't know if this was joking or not, but I was taken aback so brushed it off with a ""yeah, okay lol"" comment.

I don't feel unsafe, pressured, or used. I don't feel guilty. I just feel... something. And I don't know if it's mutual attraction slowly building, or if I'm projecting meaning onto respect, proximity, and emotional safety.

On November 15, 2007, Mark Twight [posted](https://web.archive.org/web/20090906123220/http://www.gymjones.com/schedule.php?date=20071115) a workout called 300FY on the daily programming for his gym, [Gym Jones](https://gymjones.com/). The workout was simple: 300 calories in 10 minutes on the Schwinn AirDyne bike.  Frustrated with the YouTube masses making a mockery of one of the published workouts used in training for 2006's ""300"" movie, Mark proposed an absolutely brutal workout that couldn't be cheated, scaled, or otherwise butchered:

>Why is it called ""300 FY""? First, FY means fuck you. And it's named so because there are a bunch of videos on YouTube showing so called ""Spartan training"" or ""a variation on the 300 Spartan workout"". Some were funny (the one using Thera-Bands made me spit coffee on the keyboard). Another made me wonder if its protagonist preferred what he was doing to working out. But most of the videos made me genuinely sad because they show the margin by which most people have missed the point - and I honestly wish they hadn't. ""300 FY"" is simple, and there's no way to cheat it or modify it. Some AirDynes may be more efficient than others but not too different. How do you do the workout? Saddle up, set the countdown timer for ten minutes, come out of the gate hard, and hold on. If you finish with 300 or more you have done the workout. If you finish with 299 calories you have not done it. No scaling, no changes. It cannot be dragged down to a more easily attainable level. Do what is written: just like the original ""300"" workout, which was composed as a one-time test, and taken without rehearsal or practice.

Since then, the 10-minute air bike test has been a staple of testing conditioning in Crossfit and other mixed-modal sports. It's a great test of aerobic power and all-around fitness for these sports, since it's a low-skilled movement that directly measures full-body power output across a highly relevant time domain. Matt Wiebke, founder of the [Gains Lab](https://www.thegainslab.com/) and the Year of the Engine programming, has [argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/ahhv6h/comment/eefxnji/) that the 10-minute test, especially normalized for bodyweight, is one of the best conditioning tests for Crossfit athletes.

In the early days of 300FY, a number of athletes put up some big numbers. These early tests were primarily done on the Schwinn AirDyne AD4. From the original Gym Jones crew, former UFC fighter Rob MacDonald (aka Bobby Maximus) put up the most impressive numbers: [406 calories](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cywl8LaOqqG/?hl=en&img_index=2) in 10 minutes, and 300 calories in 10 minutes twice in a row (possibly with a short rest between, I can't recall). Optimum Performance Training (OPT, now [OPEX](https://www.opexfit.com/)), a gym started by 2007 Crossfit Games champion James FitzGerald, was a big fan of the AirDyne as a training tool, and several of their athletes achieved big numbers on it. In particular, Danny Nichols successfully [completed 300FY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9As6moLJU) in 2012. In 2015, Crossfit Games athlete Brent Fikowski posted his [323 calorie attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5XpsXISob8).

# Assault Bike

By 2014, many Crossfit gyms were using AirDynes for conditioning, but these machines weren't really designed to handle the pounding of daily sprint sessions in a class setting, and mechanical issues were common. Assault Fitness first released the much more durable original Assault Bike in 2014, and by 2015 it had become one of the preferred torture devices for Crossfit gyms around the world.

The Assault Bike delivers a very similar stimulus to the original AirDynes, but notably counts calories differently from the AirDyne for the same amount of work. There's a general consensus that 200 calories on the Assault Bike is roughly equal to 300 calories on the AirDyne AD4, although I'm not aware of the exact accuracy of this conversion. It would be very interesting to see A/B testing from the same athlete to validate this conversion rate, or better yet, actual power meter measurements comparing both bikes, but I doubt we'll ever know, since AirDynes are increasingly hard to find and I'm not sure anyone actually cares enough about this to put in the work.

In the Assault Bike era, we've seen top level athletes continue to put up impressive numbers. Crossfit Games athlete Travis Mayer posted a [220 calorie](https://www.instagram.com/p/BY5_l6jH2-5/) attempt in 2017. Matt Wiebke has posted his [252 calories](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNDMUa1HjSy/?hl=en&img_index=2), and has coached at least one athlete to [249 calories](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNDMUa1HjSy/?hl=en&img_index=1). Crossfit Games athlete Patrick Vellner has been rumored to have hit 263 calories in anonymous Reddit comments, but this is unconfirmed. Danny Nichols posted [264 calories](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbc92PTlvCe/). And finally, Matt Wiebke claims to have hit [271 calories](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/ahhv6h/comment/eef1zh6/), which is the highest number I'm aware of.

On the female side, there has been far less data. The highest score I'm aware of is Katrin Davidsdottir posting [170 calories](https://www.instagram.com/p/70Yv5nhqrT/?hl=en) in 2015 (at 155 lbs!), but I think there are likely many heavier female athletes capable of producing higher scores. I'd love to see more elite female results if any athletes are willing to throw their hat into the ring!

# Rogue Echo Bike

In 2017, Rogue released their competitor to the Assault Bike, the Echo Bike. With an even more durable construction and a belt-driven design (instead of the Assault Bike's chain), the Echo Bike has mostly replaced the Assault Bike as the de facto standard in Crossfit gyms and competition, although the newer Assault Bike Pro and Elite models still turn up in Crossfit and other functional fitness competitions from time to time. For whatever reason, while many high-level athletes have posted scores above 200 calories, most modern elite Crossfit athletes have not posted a score and there haven't been any clear frontrunners as there have been with the Assault Bike. One example is former regional-level Crossfit competitor Rob Moloney posting an impressive [229 calories](https://www.instagram.com/p/CghajDxLf-x/?hl=en).

For a sense of what elite Crossfit athletes are capable of, Justin Medeiros, winner of the 2021 and 2022 Crossfit Games, who claims to not be very strong on the bike, has reported a score of 200 calories on the Echo Bike. In 2025, Dallin Pepper, James Sprague, and Jayson Hopper competed in the Rogue Echo Hammer Challenge, which was a 5-minute time trial. Sprague achieved [163 calories in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PxWOl26f1g), and Pepper and Hopper achieved [143 calories and 150 calories in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIiZxW5borI) respectively. Sprague and Pepper used a sprint/recover approach that may or may not be effective over a longer 10-minute work period and is difficult to use as a basis for estimation, but we can use Hopper's 150 in 5 as an anchor. Studies have shown in elite cyclists that peak 10-minute power is usually roughly 90-95% of peak 5-minute power. I would estimate for Crossfit athletes, this would be closer to 85%, since Crossfit athletes are less skewed towards the pure aerobic end of the spectrum and have higher anaerobic contribution than pure endurance athletes. If we also assume that the wattage displayed on the Echo Bike tracks somewhat close to actual mechanical power at these cadences (a reasonable assumption), and that calories are calculated linearly relative to wattage (this has shown experimentally to be true on the Assault Bike and should also be true on the Echo Bike), then a very rough ballpark for Hopper's 10-minute calorie target would be around 255 calories. If any of these athletes read this, who's going first?

# Comparing different bikes

Unfortunately, there are a lot of issues with comparing performances on air bikes. All popular air bike models estimate wattage and calories based on the RPMs being produced, rather than measuring actual output with a power meter as is the standard in traditional cycling. As a result, there are discrepencies between calories on different bike models. For example, as mentioned earlier, the AirDyne AD4 outputs roughly 150% of the calories as the Assault Bike for the same rate of work (at least at cadences and durations relevant to this test).

The biggest point of conversation is comparing the Assault Bike to the Echo Bike. Users of the Echo Bike almost universally claim that it feels subjectively harder than the Assault Bike. I believe this is primarily due to three main points:

1. The Echo Bike seems to have an initial delay before it begins counting calories, and it may be more difficult to initially accelerate the fan.
2. The Echo Bike is less generous with calories at very high (sprint) cadences (see [here](https://ergarcade.com/articles/airbike-rpm-speed-power.html) for a comparison of RPM vs. displayed wattage, and note that the Assault Bike RPM vs. power curve has a steeper slope).
3. The Echo Bike fan stops almost immediately after stopping pedaling, reducing the ability to coast or accumulate ""ghost"" calories at the end of an effort.

These points collectively may result in it being more difficult to accumulate calories on the Echo Bike during the most common usage in Crossfit workouts, which is shorter, harder efforts.

However, in 10-minute efforts, it appears that the calorie outputs of the Assault Bike and Echo Bike are so close as to be essentially interchangeable. The folks at [Zoar Fitness](https://zoarfitness.com/) did a [comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW25kJ-_y5I) of the same athlete doing a 10-minute trial on the Echo Bike and Assault Bike on different days. The scores were 185 calories on the Echo Bike and 180.4 calories on the Assault Bike, confirming very similar outputs. Matt Wiebke has [also confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/xkk98a/comment/ipeom4j/) that in his user performance data from the Year of the Engine app, the Echo Bike and Assault Bike seem to produce very similar outputs over longer durations.

Sadly, it gets more complicated than just differences between manufacturers. It's currently unknown whether different bike models by the same manufacturer (e.g. first-gen Assault Bike vs.  Classic vs. Pro/Elite) have different calorie algorithms, but it seems likely there have been small changes in both bike design (affecting fan resistance) and the console algorithms that would introduce small differences. Even comparing two identical bikes is not perfect. Especially on the Assault Bike, heavy use can warp the fan blades over time, resulting in the blades becoming misaligned. This reduces the air resistance of the fan, which causes some bikes to be significantly easier to produce a given RPM than others. Other factors like dust accumulation or even altitude (thinner air provides less resistance) can also make a real difference at high levels.

As a result, every air bike performance that is not done at a competition with new bikes in the same location should be taken with a grain of salt.

# The future of air bike records

For now, Matt Wiebke's 271 is the highest known score on the Assault Bike 10-minute test, and the Echo Bike throne is open for the taking. It's fun to speculate about what kind of athlete could potentially beat this score. A 10-minute effort is estimated to be 85-90% aerobic power, with the remaining power being contributed anaerobically, so any contender would need a supremely well-developed aerobic energy system.

Of course elite cyclists are the first athletes that come to mind. Track sprinters have absolutely absurd peak power (in excess of 2500W for brief moments), but I suspect that no elite sprinter has enough aerobic development to put up a record-breaking 10-minute score, since the amount of aerobic volume required to support this would be detrimental to their top-end power (and thus, performance in their actual sport).

Endurance cyclists may seem to be the best candidates, but both road and track cycling actually select against the largest athletes, since the increased mass (and surface area) comes at the cost of climbing ability and aerodynamics. As a result it's unclear if these athletes would actually be able to produce enough absolute power, despite being the clear best in the world at sustaining crazy amounts of cycling power relative to their bodyweights. I suspect a larger cyclist with high power output, such as elite gravel cyclist Brennan Wertz (6'5"", 200 lbs), could get the job done. Wertz has [a recorded one hour power output of 485W](https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/a-tower-of-power-brennan-wertzs-485-watt-hour-of-power-test), which is completely ludicrous.

The only way to know for sure is to actually have an athlete take the test. We can do napkin math about power output: the wattage numbers reported on the Assault Bike are inflated by around 10% relative to actual power output (at least at one specific power output on one specific bike), as [tested by Hamish Bond](https://www.instagram.com/p/CG9Q_VMA4V1/) using power pedals on an Assault Bike. However, even knowing this, actual cycling wattage can't be directly compared to wattage on an air bike due to its different cadence/resistance profile and arm involvement.

Speaking of Hamish Bond, he is another strong candidate for the record. Bond is a three-time Olympic gold medalist rower, who then became an international medalist level cyclist. Bond has trained on the Assault Bike, and has posted [1000 calories in 47:23 and 1255 in one hour](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAmmfKlAC4w), numbers that far exceed anyone else's for that duration, including Matt Wiebke. Other elite rowers may also be capable of similar performances.

How far do you think this test can be pushed? Do you know any elite cyclists or rowers who may be up to the challenge? Are there published attempts that I've missed? Thanks for reading, and good luck on your next 10-minute air bike test!",5,1768057617.0,crossfit,0,0.7,False

Important Note

Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's methods are a subject of discussion within the medical community, with some professionals raising concerns about the advice provided by individuals without standard medical qualifications or registration. The clinics emphasize natural, medicine-free healing protocols and encourage patients to follow their specific guidelines. 



The DIP Diet (Disciplined & Intelligent People Diet) is a revolutionary plant-based dietary system developed by Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury. It is based on extensive scientific research, including findings from 'The Great China Study on Nutrition'. The primary goal is to naturally reverse serious modern lifestyle diseases such as Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Heart Disease, Obesity, and more.

This diet emphasizes consuming natural, minimally processed food and living closer to nature.



# How the DIP Diet Works (Standard Plan)

Following the DIP Diet is straightforward and involves structuring your meals in specific steps:

# Step 1: Breakfast (Until 12 PM)

1. Consume only fruits until 12 PM.
2. Quantity: 10 times your body weight in grams (e.g., if body weight is 60 kg, eat 600g of fruits).
3. Choose 3-4 varieties of seasonal and regional fruits.
4. Avoid anything else (tea, coffee, snacks) during this period.

# Step 2: Lunch & Dinner (Plate 1 & Plate 2)

Before eating your main meal for lunch and dinner, divide your food into two plates:

# Plate 1 (Eat First):

1. This plate should consist of raw vegetable salad.
2. Include green leaves, sprouts, soaked dry fruits, tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, etc.
3. Quantity: 5 times your body weight in grams (e.g., if body weight is 60 kg, eat 300g of salad).
4. Finish Plate 1 completely before moving to Plate 2.

# Plate 2 (After finishing Plate 1):

1. This plate contains your regular cooked vegetarian food.
2. Should be prepared with minimal oil and minimal salt.
3. Can include daal, vegetables, roti/rice, etc., typical Indian vegetarian meals, provided they are cooked simply.

**Note:** You can eat as much as you want from Plate 2 until you feel full, but always eat Plate 1 first.

# Healthy Snacking Options (If Needed Between Meals)

While the DIP Diet is designed to keep you full, if you feel hungry between meals, here are some healthy, DIP-compliant snacking options:

1. **Extra Fruits:** Any seasonal fruit can be a great snack.
2. **Raw Vegetables:** Carrot sticks, cucumber slices, bell pepper strips.
3. **Green Leaves:** A small handful of spinach or other edible green leaves.
4. **Fresh Juices:** Freshly squeezed vegetable juices (like carrot, beetroot, spinach) without added sugar or salt. Fruit juices are generally part of Step 1.
5. **Raw Coconut or Coconut Water:** Excellent for hydration and electrolytes.
6. **Roasted Seeds (unsalted):** A small quantity of sunflower, pumpkin, or flax seeds.
7. **Soaked Dry Fruits:** A few soaked almonds, walnuts, or raisins (in moderation).
8. **Clear Vegetable Soup (unsalted, no oil):** Warm and light.
9. **Hunza Chai:** A healthy herbal beverage.
10. **Millets (cooked, plain):** Small portions of cooked millets like foxtail, kodo, or little millet can be considered if extremely hungry, but prioritize raw options.

**Important:** Snacking should be minimal and only if genuinely hungry. The main meals are designed to provide adequate nutrition and satiety.

# Things to Strictly Avoid as advised by Dr Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury:

1. Packed and Processed Food
2. Dairy and Milk Products (including curd, paneer, ghee, butter, ice cream)
3. Tea and Coffee
4. Multivitamins and Tonics)
5. Any artificial supplements.

The principle is simple: consume only nature-based, unprocessed food.

**Important Note:** This is a standard plan. It can be modified based on specific diseases or individual health conditions under expert guidance.

  
**Potential Benefits of Dr BRC's DIP Diet & Lifestyle**

This dietary approach, often complemented by the therapies mentioned, may help in (expert consultation is recommended):

1. Controlling and potentially reversing Diabetes
2. Normalizing High Blood Pressure
3. Weight Management
4. Improving Digestive Health
5. Boosting Energy Levels
6. Enhancing overall health and vitality
7. Reducing inflammation and pain
8. Supporting detoxification processes



# Additional Dr BRC Therapies for Enhanced Healing

Along with the DIP Diet, certain natural therapies can significantly enhance the healing process and overall well-being. These are often recommended as part of Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's protocols:

* **Sunlight Exposure:** Aim for at least 45 minutes of daily sunlight exposure (preferably morning or late afternoon sun) on as much bare skin as possible. Sunlight is crucial for Vitamin D synthesis, which plays a vital role in immunity, bone health, and mood regulation.
* **0 Volt Therapy or Earthing:** Spend at least 2 hours daily in direct contact with the earth (walking barefoot on grass, soil, or sand). This practice is believed to reduce inflammation, improve sleep, and normalize cortisol rhythms by connecting your body to the earth's natural electrical charge.
* **Hot Water Immersion (HWI):** Immerse your body (up to the neck) in hot water (around 40°C or as comfortable) for about 30 minutes. This can help improve blood circulation, relax muscles, reduce blood pressure, and aid in detoxification. Often recommended for kidney patients and those with hypertension, under guidance.
* **Head Down Tilt (HDT):** This involves lying on a tilted surface with your head lower than your feet (e.g., tilting your bed by 10-15 degrees) for about 2 hours daily, often during sleep. This therapy is suggested to improve circulation to the brain and vital organs, and may be beneficial for various conditions. Always start gradually and under expert advice.
* **Deep Breathing (Pranayama) or Simple Yoga Exercises:** Practicing deep breathing exercises (like Anulom Vilom, Bhramari) or simple yoga *asanas* can reduce stress, improve lung capacity, enhance oxygenation of tissues, and promote mental clarity and calmness.

No specific foods seem to trigger me anymore besides eating a large meal late at night regardless of what the meal is, so I eat my last calorie 4+ hours before bed. 

This seems to be very different from many other stories where a single coffee or a certain food could send them into a flare. I can't really even relate to the word flare as my symptoms are constant regardless of what I do, they only get worse if I eat large volumes even if the food is healthy.

I've tried many supplements, esomeprazole (nexium). Nothing has given symptom relief, the only thing that gave me any noticeable relief was alcohol which is very counterintuitive, I'm talking 2 glasses of wine with dinner over the holidays. I noticed it reduced my symptoms by 80%+.. I almost felt normal again, it was incredible, but quickly wore off by night time and next morning.

Does this point to there being a nerve/mental component that I need a neuromodulator for?

  
The ENT recently saw clear irritation in the larynx area

It feels like there are many things going on at the same time, LPR-like symptoms post treatment (had no sore throat pre-treatment, although I did have the globus sensation), as well as the constant epigastric pressure.

I'm feeling completely stuck  
  
Background:  
Been struggling with symptoms for around 8 months, I got what I believed to be food poisoning for a few days after a period of a lot of work, stress, social engagements with drinking and fast food. The doctor prescribed me PPI's which I took for a few weeks until I felt a bit better and then stopped, I then had recurring symptoms (extreme bloating, burning sensation in upper abdomen, constant burping, fatigue) and went back to the Dr who told me I hadn't taken Nexium for long enough and this time told me to take 80mg (40+40) for 2-4 weeks, he also told me it's fine to eat and drink 'as normal', no special diet needed. Needless to say, I didn't feel any better, I feel that Nexium had no effect on me whatsoever.

  
After this I started reading many stories online and decided to go on a strict diet, eating only my own cooking, no alcohol, coffee etc. I did this for 3-4 weeks and felt no better so I got an endoscopy, they found H pylori and 'mild active gastritis', finally I had something that could explain why I've been feeling this way. The Dr prescribed quad therapy and emphasised not to go on any strict diet. The treatment was not fun as many of you know but I got through it, felt horrible the week or two after which prompted me to decide to go on a very strict diet myself in order to give myself the best chance to heal. For 4 weeks I did the gastritis-healing book diet, followed it to the letter, as well as cabbage juice twice a day, famotadine, sucralfate. During this time, I didn't feel much better with most symptoms, however the stomach burning has mostly gone. I slowly reintroduced foods one by one and waited to see if any reaction, but there were none.   
  
A few weeks after that, I had one day where I had a lot of chest burning and throat burning.

This led to me losing my voice for a week and having a persistent sore throat for over 1.5 months now. I went back to my GI who suggested a low dose neuromodulator (amitriptyline)  as well as saw an ENT who scoped my throat, saw real irritation in the larynx area, dismissed the neromodulator idea and prescribed Nexium 40mg again. He told me it wouldn't get better without Nexium. So I'm now one month into taking Nexium 40mg, feeling no better.",1,1768057273.0,HPylori,0,1.0,False

An ugly two-tone cracker box, it appeared ready to collapse at the first strong breeze. Loud hip-hop bass thumps rattled its walls. A handful of celebrants stood in the driveway, clutching beer cans. 

 

“This is the place,” Etta said. “Look, there’s a parking spot two houses up.”

 

Unfortunately, the space was fire hydrant adjacent, and they ended up parking a block over. After double-checking his SUV’s locks, Douglas trailed the girls to the party. 

 

They crossed a dead lawn, to rattle a steel security screen. It swung open before them, and there stood Mike Munson, the festivity’s host. His eyes were bloodshot and his posture was slumped, but he brightened in the females’ presence. 

 

“Etta and Karen,” he slurred. “Great to see you. And who’s that you brought with you? Is that…*Douglas Stanton*? Ghost Boy? You actually brought Ghost Boy! That’s classic!”

 

“Good to be here,” Douglas muttered sarcastically, but Mike had already turned away. 

 

“Follow me, you guys. We’ve got a keg of Newcastle in the backyard.”

 

As they navigated through the townhouse, Douglas saw his fellow students clustered in the dining area, kitchen and living room. Some pointed him out to other revelers, mocking him in subdued voices. He’d have to devise an escape plan, he decided, before their mockery segued into drunken bullying.

 

Half-remembered faces, thinned from shed baby fat, turned to regard him. Douglas saw Marty McGuire and Kevin Jones, who’d both transferred to Vista High School rather than East Pacific. He saw Justine Brubaker and Esmeralda Carrera, the latter of whom stood surrounded by potential suitors. Trampling over cigarette butts and spilled-beer puddles, in a fetid atmosphere redolent with vomit, he absorbed every detail. 

 

On an afghan-covered sofa, two chubby girls tongue-wrestled, cheered on by an audience of drooling jocks. Two shirtless Samoans wrestled on the floor below them, unnoticed by most. Douglas even saw a few men in their mid-thirties, clinging to youth delusions as they propositioned underage teenagers.  

 

In the backyard, Mike pulled three plastic cups from a keg-proximate bag. “Ladies drink free,” he announced. “That’ll be five bucks, Douglas.”

 

“I’m the designated driver,” Douglas muttered, waving the cup away.

 

“Designated bitch is more like it,” Mike sneered. 

 

The keg nestled in an ice-filled trashcan, surrounded by dazed celebrants. Etta and Karen found their cups quickly filled, and began to sip politely. Douglas knew that soon they’d begin circulating the party, abandoning him to his own devices. Before they could leave, he lightly touched Etta’s elbow and asked her when Missy was coming. 

 

“Yeah, I called her earlier. It turns out she’s staying in tonight.”

 

“What?”

 

“I’m only kidding, man. You should’ve seen your face just now; it was like I kicked your scrotum. Missy will be here any minute, don’t worry. Meanwhile, why don’t you relax a little? Want me to ask around, see if anyone thinks you’re cute?”

 

“No, thanks.”

 

“Are you sure? Some girls are actually attracted to quiet loners. It’s not like you’re hideously deformed or anything.”

 

“I’m alright.”

 

“If you say so.” Etta took a long gulp of Newcastle, and then said, “Anyway, it’s been fun talkin’ with you—fun like a case of chickenpox—but it’s time for Karen and me to mingle. You wanna make the rounds with us?”

 

“No…that’s okay. I’ll catch up with you gals later, I guess.”

 

Etta dragged Karen into the house. Beer sloshed over their cup rims to splatter the back patio. Douglas shuffled his feet, stared into the sky, and shrugged his shoulders, wishing to be anywhere else. Then Kevin rushed into the backyard, his face flushed under vibrant red hair, shouting, “Dude, Starla’s in the bathroom puking right now!” 

 

“Please tell me that bitch is at least making it into the toilet,” Mike responded, slumped over the keg. 

 

“Mostly, but there’s definitely some side spray. She’ll be passed out on the floor any minute.”

 

“Then we’ll have our way with her!” Mike shouted, eliciting cheers from most of the assembled males. “I don’t care if she’s got puke running down her ass crack, that chick is fine as fuck!”

 

Since his arrival, Douglas had been uncannily aware of the vox populi judging and belittling him. Now he heard the voice of the people change its target, shifting its crosshairs toward Starla. Male, female, and less identifiable vocalizations converged, making sport of the nauseous beauty: 

 

“She’s such a whore.”

 

“I heard that her cousin molested her.”

 

“I fucked her last year, and she didn’t even remember me two days later.”

 

“And she has the nerve to be so stuck up. Get over yourself, girl.”

 

“Dude, I’d drink her bathwater.”

 

Douglas wondered if he should be glad they’d forgotten him—if only momentarily. Starla had always been a bitch, and it seemed that karma had finally circled around to bite her on the ass. But all that he could muster was resigned melancholy. 

 

As he stepped back into the house, a new odor met his nostrils: a sweet, skunky fragrance. He saw a cloud-like haze drifting beneath the ceiling, heard harsh coughing emanating from the living room. Intrigued, he followed the cannabis aroma.  

 

The possible lesbians had left the sofa, as had their audience. Wilting upon it now were Corey Pfeiffer, Marty McGuire, Etta, Karen, and some guy Douglas didn’t recognize. On the coffee table, a freezer bag two-thirds filled with marijuana yawned. Drawing closer, Douglas saw orange and purple hairs interspersed throughout each weed nugget.  

 

Karen sat frigid, arms crossed, shoulders drawn up to her earlobes. It was obvious that the weed made her uncomfortable, and only Etta’s presence kept her rooted in place. The other couch-dwellers displayed none of this averseness, however, with easy grins and lidded eyes being their predominant facial features. Among them, a tall glass bong circulated, pausing only for intermittent bowl refills. 

 

Corey blew out a lungful, registered Douglas’ presence, and peppered his cough attack with laughter. “Holy shit,” he managed to choke out, elbowing Etta playfully. “You said he was here, but I thought you were fuckin’ with me. Get the fuck over here, Douglas, and shake my hand.”

 

Warily, Douglas approached. He found his hand engulfed in Corey’s massive paw, pumping vigorously up and down.

 

“Do you smoke, man?” Corey asked. “My cousin just brought this shit down from Humboldt. Dude, you won’t find anything better in all of SoCal. If you’re already seein’ ghosts, who knows what it’ll make you see?”

 

The couch-dwellers burst into laughter paroxysms, knocking against each other like glass bottles in a backpack. When they finally subsided, Douglas told Corey, “I don’t usually smoke, but I could give it a try.”

 

“What?” Etta cried out. “Really? You?”

 

“Sure. It’s only weed. Don’t act like you four are living on the edge.”

 

“Big words,” Marty chimed in. “Load him up, Corey.”

 

A fresh nugget went into the bowl. Douglas found himself staring into a resinous glass tube, at fragrant black water churning malignantly. Karen disappeared toward the bathroom, so he claimed her vacant sofa space.     

 

“Here’s to the ganja deities,” the stranger declared, lifting his index toward the ceiling. Douglas wrote him off as just another blowhard playing at profundity—the latest in a long succession stretching back to time’s dawning—but the others cheered. 

 

Shrugging, Douglas placed his mouth to the glass, flicked the Bic, and inhaled. The herb became a miniature inferno, a lovely little fire blossom. He drew deeply, held it for half a minute, and exhaled without coughing. 

 

“I never thought I’d see this,” Marty commented, reaching for the bong. In a giggly drawl, Etta seconded the statement.  

 

But Douglas had *some* familiarity with drugs. He’d treaded in the memory forms of many users, deep in the Phantom Cabinet’s dream wisps. Therein, he’d experienced the whole gamut of intoxicants: weed, amphetamines, smack, Ecstasy, cacti, LSD, and the fever visions of government lab rats, whose mad, later abandoned drug strains left them drooling vegetables, or sometimes killed them outright. Though his own lungs were unscarred, Douglas wasn’t as sheltered as his peers liked to imagine.

 

The bong circulated for a while, with Douglas lingering in the rotation. Despite his earlier reservations, he *was*beginning to enjoy himself, sinking into a loose camaraderie that he hadn’t felt since those bygone days with Emmett and Benjy. He no longer cared who made fun of him, or if Missy ever actually showed up. Instead, he became absorbed in the stereo-blasted hip-hop, head bobbing to its bass-heavy beat. 

 

Time blinked, and he realized that the others were gone, along with their glassware and weed. In their place was a beautiful girl, whom he slowly identified as Esmeralda Carrere. Sporting an unreadable expression, she sat mere inches away.   

 

Douglas had never spoken to Esmeralda, had been content to admire her from afar, stolen glances across campus hallways and classrooms. With her smoky green eyes turned upon him, he found himself drowning in desire, confusion and outright terror, grasping for words to say. 

 

At last, he managed to choke out, “Nice party, isn’t it?”

 

“You could say that,” she replied, somewhat sarcastically. 

 

“My name’s Douglas, in case you didn’t know.”

 

“Of course I remember you. You’re practically a celebrity around these parts. Just tonight, I’ve heard *all kinds* of stories about you.”

 

“So they were talking about me. I knew it.”

 

“Boring people love to denigrate others. Why do you think I broke away to come visit you?”

 

“*Denigrate*? That’s a big word for a pretty girl.” 

 

“I’m in Advanced Placement; there’s no need to stereotype me.” 

 

“Sorry.”

 

“You seem a little twitchy, Douglas. Do I make you nervous?”

 

“A little bit,” he admitted sheepishly. 

 

“Good. That means you won’t bullshit me when I ask you this question—not if you know what’s good for you.” 

 

“What’s the question?” he asked, responding to her brazenness. 

 

“I was wondering if it’s true what they say about you. Do you really see ghosts?”

 

After a protracted pause, Douglas answered, “If I did, why would I tell ya? You’ll just laugh about it with your friends later.”

 

Her face contracted in mock annoyance. “No, I won’t do that. My grandma used to talk about ghosts all the time, how she’d been visited by loved ones weeks after they died. Whatever you tell me will be our little secret, I promise.”

 

Douglas exhaled deeply. His thoughts were in disarray: half of them wanting to trust Esmeralda, the other half marking her as an enemy. Against his better judgment, he said, “Yeah, it’s true. I’ve been seeing ghosts all my life. They appear in mirrors, puddles, and sometimes in three-dimensional space. Sometimes I can’t even see ’em, just objects moving by themselves. Occasionally, they talk to me.”

 

“Wow. What do they say?”

 

“It depends on the ghost. Most of them just want to bitch about the coldness of the grave, or whine about their deaths. You know, *Ghost Whisperer*\-type shit. I’ve only known one who could hold a decent conversation. He was an astronaut, if you can believe that.”

 

“An astronaut. Now you’re just messing with me.”

 

Douglas held up an open palm. “Hand to God, I’m telling you the complete, unvarnished truth. His name was Commander Frank Gordon, and he died on a freakin’ space shuttle. I thought he was my best friend, until we had a falling out.”

 

“See, I knew you’d be interesting to talk to. Tell me, how does someone have a falling out with a ghost?”

 

“You can ask, but I won’t tell ya. Let’s just say that Gordon wants me to act against my own best interests, and leave it at that.”

 

Esmeralda’s forehead creased. Leaning forward, she practically whispered, “Hey, Douglas, what was the scariest ghost you ever met?”

 

He opened his mouth, preparing to describe the porcelain-masked entity and all of her multifaceted agonies, when Mike burst into the room. 

 

“We’ve got margaritas in the kitchen!” he shouted. “Come grab a glass!” Mike could barely clutch his own drink, tilting it to spill yellow sludge upon the carpet, which trailed him into the backyard.

 

“Those will be going fast,” Esmeralda remarked. “We’ll finish our convo in a second.” 

 

Douglas followed her into the kitchen, watching her tight ass swish back and forth in a practically painted-on miniskirt. It was an enjoyable sight, provoking a sudden shift in his nether region.   

 

He didn’t know what was happening. Did Esmeralda’s sudden interest denote sexual attraction, or just pity? Should he try to kiss her, or at least put his arm around her? Fear and exhilaration battled within his psyche, like Godzilla fighting Megalon. 

 

In the kitchen, a leaking blender perched upon cracked marble countertop. Shouldering her way through intoxicated teenagers, Esmeralda grabbed a margarita glass. She salted its rim and poured out a generous helping of yellow cocktail. 

 

“Want one?” she asked Douglas.

 

“I’m driving.” 

 

Sipping, she replied, “That’s too bad, it’s really yummy. Anyhow, let’s go back to the couch and you can tell me more ghost stories.”

 

Eye-roving from her heart-shaped face to her breast-swollen halter top, Douglas said, “I can’t think of a single thing I’d rather do.”

 

“Enthusiasm, I like it.”

 

This time, Douglas led the way to the living room. He spotted someone on the sofa and his heart sank. Realizing the interloper’s identity, he damn near cried. Missy Peterson had finally arrived.

 

“I’m sorry, but I promised that I’d talk to Missy tonight,” he whispered confidentially. “She’s been seeing ghosts, too, and needs some advice. Can we finish this later?”

 

Esmeralda pouted. “You’d rather talk to that skank than me?”

 

“Fuck no. But I’d rather not break my promise, if I don’t have to. It won’t take long.”

 

“*Okay*, Douglas, come find me when you’re finished. Hey, before I go, can I ask one last thing?”

 

“Go for it.”

 

She asked, “Have you ever seen any ectoplasm?”

 

“Ectoplasm?”

 

“Yeah, you know, it’s like ghost jism. In movies, they’re always talking about it. Wherever there’s a ghost, it leaves slimy white goop behind.”

 

“Sorry, but I don’t think that’s a real thing. At least, I’ve never seen any. There’s been plenty of green fog, though.”

 

“Oh,” she said, disappointed. “Well, I guess that’s *something*.” After kissing him lightly on the cheek, she flitted away, taking Douglas’ good cheer as a keepsake.  

 

Annoyed, he turned to Missy, noting her shabby appearance. Her face was puffy, her nose red and crusted. Her hair looked as if it had gone weeks without water and brush, and she hadn’t even applied makeup. In a baggy sweatshirt and ugly mustard-yellow capris, she exuded misery from every pore.

 

Stepping into her wretched miasma, Douglas collapsed onto the sofa, carefully keeping a cushion between them. “You wanted to talk to me?” he asked.

 

Sniffing back errant snot, she wailed, “Please, you have to help me. They killed my sister, and now they’re coming to get me. I don’t know what to do.”

 

“Who killed your sister?” Douglas asked, fearing that he already knew the answer. 

 

“The spirits did. I think it was the shadow man. He’s the one who showed me her corpse.”

 

“Shadow man? I heard your sister killed herself, that she slashed her wrists open and bled to death.”

 

“Then…then why was her hair all white? You, of all people, know ghosts are real. What, you think you’re the only one they visit?”

 

Douglas let the question hang for a minute. In the face of her wretchedness, his weed influence abated. Uncomfortably sober, he wished that Missy would just go away, before his entire night was ruined. 

 

“Okay, Missy, let’s pretend I believe you. *You’re seeing ghosts.* Terrifying stuff, to be certain, but what the hell do you expect me to do about it? Do I look like a fuckin’ Ghostbuster? Am I wearing a proton pack?”

 

“I just…I just thought…” Her sentence devolved into sobbing.

 

Some small segment of Douglas rejoiced in her misery, reasoning that she’d never been particularly kind to him. But he wasn’t truly malicious, and thus moved to comfort. Placing an arm around Missy—wincing at her pungent clamminess—he said, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have put it like that. But the sad fact is, while I am familiar with ghosts, I have no idea how to get rid of the bastards. The best advice I can give you is to stand up to them, to let them know you’re not afraid. Maybe they’ll go away afterward.”

 

“I was afraid you’d say that,” Missy moaned, leaping from the couch to sprint away, sobbing. 

 

Douglas felt guilty, knowing of his own deception. He knew that courage wouldn’t diffuse a haunting; the very thought was ludicrous. Only one thing would ensure the girl’s peace of mind—his own death—and he had no plans to clue Missy in to that little tidbit. In her mind state, she was liable to come after him with a firearm. 

 

He set off to find Esmeralda. Unable to locate her in the backyard, kitchen or garage, he was considering checking the bedrooms when Etta strutted up determinately. 

 

“What the hell did you say to her, Douglas? She’s in the goddamn bathtub right now, next to a passed-out Starla, crying uncontrollably. Missy was better off before she came here.”

 

“Yeah…about that. Listen, Etta, I tried to help her, but what was I supposed to say? Was I supposed to tell her that everything is fine and dandy, when it obviously isn’t? If she’s really being haunted, then there’s nothing I can do about it…nothing *she* can do about it.”

 

“I guess there was no reason to invite you, after all,” she hissed. “Anyway, Karen and I will be riding home with Missy, so I’ll see you around. Thanks for nothin’.” 

 

Douglas watched her stride away, and then resumed his search for Esmeralda. In the scattered face assortment, hers remained elusive. Finally, he pulled Kevin Jones aside and asked if he’d seen her.

 

“Yeah, dude, she took off with one of those older guys. You didn’t really think you had a chance with her, did you?”

 

With no reason to remain, Douglas left the cacophony behind, driving home with Esmeralda never far from his thoughts. 

 

As for the girl in question, she emerged from Mike’s parents’ bathroom—which, unlike the other, had yet to be splashed with regurgitant—a few minutes later. Throughout his search, she’d been checking her hair and makeup, gargling with a bottle of purse Scope. Learning of Douglas’ departure, she could scarcely hide her disappointment.   

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Upon solar winds, a green wisp traveled, emanating from no known point of origin. Against a star-speckled backdrop, it twisted and twirled, sporting features almost recognizable as human. 

 

The specter glided amidst space junk, floating in a graveyard orbit, a lonely supersynchronous course just beyond operational range. Bypassing spent rocket stages and collision fragments, it passed within a defunct communications satellite, breaching the aluminum shell, spreading its consciousness throughout the structure. 

 

Solar panels long dormant sprang back to life, converting sun energy into electricity. The on-board processors endured similar revivification, followed by the propulsion, communications, thermal control and altitude control systems. Now only the telemetry and command system remained offline, preventing the earthbound living from monitoring and guiding the device. 

 

Unbeknownst to NORAD, the first satellite haunting had proven successful. The dead had new tools with which to spread terror, knocking the existential status quo off its axis. Soon, a green fog was rolling across the cosmos, leaving dozens of similarly resurrected satellites in its wake. ",1,1768057043.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

But Douglas had *some* familiarity with drugs. He’d treaded in the memory forms of many users, deep in the Phantom Cabinet’s dream wisps. Therein, he’d experienced the whole gamut of intoxicants: weed, amphetamines, smack, Ecstasy, cacti, LSD, and the fever visions of government lab rats, whose mad, later abandoned drug strains left them drooling vegetables, or sometimes killed them outright. Though his own lungs were unscarred, Douglas wasn’t as sheltered as his peers liked to imagine.

 

The bong circulated for a while, with Douglas lingering in the rotation. Despite his earlier reservations, he *was*beginning to enjoy himself, sinking into a loose camaraderie that he hadn’t felt since those bygone days with Emmett and Benjy. He no longer cared who made fun of him, or if Missy ever actually showed up. Instead, he became absorbed in the stereo-blasted hip-hop, head bobbing to its bass-heavy beat. 

 

Time blinked, and he realized that the others were gone, along with their glassware and weed. In their place was a beautiful girl, whom he slowly identified as Esmeralda Carrere. Sporting an unreadable expression, she sat mere inches away.   

 

Douglas had never spoken to Esmeralda, had been content to admire her from afar, stolen glances across campus hallways and classrooms. With her smoky green eyes turned upon him, he found himself drowning in desire, confusion and outright terror, grasping for words to say. 

 

At last, he managed to choke out, “Nice party, isn’t it?”

 

“You could say that,” she replied, somewhat sarcastically. 

 

“My name’s Douglas, in case you didn’t know.”

 

“Of course I remember you. You’re practically a celebrity around these parts. Just tonight, I’ve heard *all kinds* of stories about you.”

 

“So they were talking about me. I knew it.”

 

“Boring people love to denigrate others. Why do you think I broke away to come visit you?”

 

“*Denigrate*? That’s a big word for a pretty girl.” 

 

“I’m in Advanced Placement; there’s no need to stereotype me.” 

 

“Sorry.”

 

“You seem a little twitchy, Douglas. Do I make you nervous?”

 

“A little bit,” he admitted sheepishly. 

 

“Good. That means you won’t bullshit me when I ask you this question—not if you know what’s good for you.” 

 

“What’s the question?” he asked, responding to her brazenness. 

 

“I was wondering if it’s true what they say about you. Do you really see ghosts?”

 

After a protracted pause, Douglas answered, “If I did, why would I tell ya? You’ll just laugh about it with your friends later.”

 

Her face contracted in mock annoyance. “No, I won’t do that. My grandma used to talk about ghosts all the time, how she’d been visited by loved ones weeks after they died. Whatever you tell me will be our little secret, I promise.”

 

Douglas exhaled deeply. His thoughts were in disarray: half of them wanting to trust Esmeralda, the other half marking her as an enemy. Against his better judgment, he said, “Yeah, it’s true. I’ve been seeing ghosts all my life. They appear in mirrors, puddles, and sometimes in three-dimensional space. Sometimes I can’t even see ’em, just objects moving by themselves. Occasionally, they talk to me.”

 

“Wow. What do they say?”

 

“It depends on the ghost. Most of them just want to bitch about the coldness of the grave, or whine about their deaths. You know, *Ghost Whisperer*\-type shit. I’ve only known one who could hold a decent conversation. He was an astronaut, if you can believe that.”

 

“An astronaut. Now you’re just messing with me.”

 

Douglas held up an open palm. “Hand to God, I’m telling you the complete, unvarnished truth. His name was Commander Frank Gordon, and he died on a freakin’ space shuttle. I thought he was my best friend, until we had a falling out.”

 

“See, I knew you’d be interesting to talk to. Tell me, how does someone have a falling out with a ghost?”

 

“You can ask, but I won’t tell ya. Let’s just say that Gordon wants me to act against my own best interests, and leave it at that.”

 

Esmeralda’s forehead creased. Leaning forward, she practically whispered, “Hey, Douglas, what was the scariest ghost you ever met?”

 

He opened his mouth, preparing to describe the porcelain-masked entity and all of her multifaceted agonies, when Mike burst into the room. 

 

“We’ve got margaritas in the kitchen!” he shouted. “Come grab a glass!” Mike could barely clutch his own drink, tilting it to spill yellow sludge upon the carpet, which trailed him into the backyard.

 

“Those will be going fast,” Esmeralda remarked. “We’ll finish our convo in a second.” 

 

Douglas followed her into the kitchen, watching her tight ass swish back and forth in a practically painted-on miniskirt. It was an enjoyable sight, provoking a sudden shift in his nether region.   

 

He didn’t know what was happening. Did Esmeralda’s sudden interest denote sexual attraction, or just pity? Should he try to kiss her, or at least put his arm around her? Fear and exhilaration battled within his psyche, like Godzilla fighting Megalon. 

 

In the kitchen, a leaking blender perched upon cracked marble countertop. Shouldering her way through intoxicated teenagers, Esmeralda grabbed a margarita glass. She salted its rim and poured out a generous helping of yellow cocktail. 

 

“Want one?” she asked Douglas.

 

“I’m driving.” 

 

Sipping, she replied, “That’s too bad, it’s really yummy. Anyhow, let’s go back to the couch and you can tell me more ghost stories.”

 

Eye-roving from her heart-shaped face to her breast-swollen halter top, Douglas said, “I can’t think of a single thing I’d rather do.”

 

“Enthusiasm, I like it.”

 

This time, Douglas led the way to the living room. He spotted someone on the sofa and his heart sank. Realizing the interloper’s identity, he damn near cried. Missy Peterson had finally arrived.

 

“I’m sorry, but I promised that I’d talk to Missy tonight,” he whispered confidentially. “She’s been seeing ghosts, too, and needs some advice. Can we finish this later?”

 

Esmeralda pouted. “You’d rather talk to that skank than me?”

 

“Fuck no. But I’d rather not break my promise, if I don’t have to. It won’t take long.”

 

“*Okay*, Douglas, come find me when you’re finished. Hey, before I go, can I ask one last thing?”

 

“Go for it.”

 

She asked, “Have you ever seen any ectoplasm?”

 

“Ectoplasm?”

 

“Yeah, you know, it’s like ghost jism. In movies, they’re always talking about it. Wherever there’s a ghost, it leaves slimy white goop behind.”

 

“Sorry, but I don’t think that’s a real thing. At least, I’ve never seen any. There’s been plenty of green fog, though.”

 

“Oh,” she said, disappointed. “Well, I guess that’s *something*.” After kissing him lightly on the cheek, she flitted away, taking Douglas’ good cheer as a keepsake.  

 

Annoyed, he turned to Missy, noting her shabby appearance. Her face was puffy, her nose red and crusted. Her hair looked as if it had gone weeks without water and brush, and she hadn’t even applied makeup. In a baggy sweatshirt and ugly mustard-yellow capris, she exuded misery from every pore.

 

Stepping into her wretched miasma, Douglas collapsed onto the sofa, carefully keeping a cushion between them. “You wanted to talk to me?” he asked.

 

Sniffing back errant snot, she wailed, “Please, you have to help me. They killed my sister, and now they’re coming to get me. I don’t know what to do.”

 

“Who killed your sister?” Douglas asked, fearing that he already knew the answer. 

 

“The spirits did. I think it was the shadow man. He’s the one who showed me her corpse.”

 

“Shadow man? I heard your sister killed herself, that she slashed her wrists open and bled to death.”

 

“Then…then why was her hair all white? You, of all people, know ghosts are real. What, you think you’re the only one they visit?”

 

Douglas let the question hang for a minute. In the face of her wretchedness, his weed influence abated. Uncomfortably sober, he wished that Missy would just go away, before his entire night was ruined. 

 

“Okay, Missy, let’s pretend I believe you. *You’re seeing ghosts.* Terrifying stuff, to be certain, but what the hell do you expect me to do about it? Do I look like a fuckin’ Ghostbuster? Am I wearing a proton pack?”

 

“I just…I just thought…” Her sentence devolved into sobbing.

 

Some small segment of Douglas rejoiced in her misery, reasoning that she’d never been particularly kind to him. But he wasn’t truly malicious, and thus moved to comfort. Placing an arm around Missy—wincing at her pungent clamminess—he said, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have put it like that. But the sad fact is, while I am familiar with ghosts, I have no idea how to get rid of the bastards. The best advice I can give you is to stand up to them, to let them know you’re not afraid. Maybe they’ll go away afterward.”

 

“I was afraid you’d say that,” Missy moaned, leaping from the couch to sprint away, sobbing. 

 

Douglas felt guilty, knowing of his own deception. He knew that courage wouldn’t diffuse a haunting; the very thought was ludicrous. Only one thing would ensure the girl’s peace of mind—his own death—and he had no plans to clue Missy in to that little tidbit. In her mind state, she was liable to come after him with a firearm. 

 

He set off to find Esmeralda. Unable to locate her in the backyard, kitchen or garage, he was considering checking the bedrooms when Etta strutted up determinately. 

 

“What the hell did you say to her, Douglas? She’s in the goddamn bathtub right now, next to a passed-out Starla, crying uncontrollably. Missy was better off before she came here.”

 

“Yeah…about that. Listen, Etta, I tried to help her, but what was I supposed to say? Was I supposed to tell her that everything is fine and dandy, when it obviously isn’t? If she’s really being haunted, then there’s nothing I can do about it…nothing *she* can do about it.”

 

“I guess there was no reason to invite you, after all,” she hissed. “Anyway, Karen and I will be riding home with Missy, so I’ll see you around. Thanks for nothin’.” 

 

Douglas watched her stride away, and then resumed his search for Esmeralda. In the scattered face assortment, hers remained elusive. Finally, he pulled Kevin Jones aside and asked if he’d seen her.

 

“Yeah, dude, she took off with one of those older guys. You didn’t really think you had a chance with her, did you?”

 

With no reason to remain, Douglas left the cacophony behind, driving home with Esmeralda never far from his thoughts. 

 

As for the girl in question, she emerged from Mike’s parents’ bathroom—which, unlike the other, had yet to be splashed with regurgitant—a few minutes later. Throughout his search, she’d been checking her hair and makeup, gargling with a bottle of purse Scope. Learning of Douglas’ departure, she could scarcely hide her disappointment.   

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Upon solar winds, a green wisp traveled, emanating from no known point of origin. Against a star-speckled backdrop, it twisted and twirled, sporting features almost recognizable as human. 

 

The specter glided amidst space junk, floating in a graveyard orbit, a lonely supersynchronous course just beyond operational range. Bypassing spent rocket stages and collision fragments, it passed within a defunct communications satellite, breaching the aluminum shell, spreading its consciousness throughout the structure. 

 

Solar panels long dormant sprang back to life, converting sun energy into electricity. The on-board processors endured similar revivification, followed by the propulsion, communications, thermal control and altitude control systems. Now only the telemetry and command system remained offline, preventing the earthbound living from monitoring and guiding the device. 

 

Unbeknownst to NORAD, the first satellite haunting had proven successful. The dead had new tools with which to spread terror, knocking the existential status quo off its axis. Soon, a green fog was rolling across the cosmos, leaving dozens of similarly resurrected satellites in its wake. ",1,1768057014.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False
1q963xr,https://i.redd.it/fbez5h27djcg1.jpeg,Confessions of a Shopaholic (2009),"My mom and I watched this movie this week, as it’s leaving Netflix on January 17.  

I chose this movie as I felt we could both relate to it to some extent, despite not being as extreme as Rebecca.

This movie is relevant now more than ever, and has aged well, in the age of Klarna, and other installment/buy now, pay later plans.  It is dystopian whenever I see ads about getting $100 immediately to be able to get a coffee.  Or when I see a Sephora ad that says you can get an overpriced sample sized gift set in 4 installments.  It’s so unethical and pushes people to be like Rebecca.

I was proud of her when she turned down the job at Alette to write about the expensive shoes in the budget column, as she felt it wasn’t right.

Even though this may be a “rom-com/chick-flick,” I feel like more people should see it, as it is a cautionary tale.  Even if some guys don’t buy thousands in clothes, they may still buy a lot in games on Steam, or in crypto.  Everyone has a vice.

My mom got frustrated and tuned out as Rebecca kept making mistakes and struggled to learn, but it added more realism that she didn’t turn her life around immediately.  I was proud of her in the end, though.  What was unrealistic, however, was that she still maintained her friendship with her roommate and got into a relationship with her boss, who she lied to.  But a happy ending is par for the course for these PG movies.

I'm building an RTD protein coffee and I need your help to get it right.

Here's the problem: Every time I want a good coffee, it's either:

* A cafe-bought coffee that costs ₹150+ and has zero protein
* A protein shake that tastes chalky and kills my afternoon vibe
* Some sugary ""coffee drink"" that's basically dessert

**None of these work.** I want something that actually tastes like good coffee, doesn't bloat me, and keeps me fueled for 4+ hours.

So I'm building it: A 250ml RTD Can with 10-12g Protein, 75mg Caffeine, zero added sugar, and targeting ₹80-99.

Think of it as: **Cold Brew meets Protein, but without the trade-offs.**

I need to validate three things before I launch:

1. **The Price**: Would ₹80-99 feel like a daily habit or a treat?
2. **The Taste**: Do you want it to taste like crisp black coffee or creamy like a cafe latte?
3. **Where You'd Buy It**: Office pantry? Gym? Quick commerce? Transit hub?

I could tell certain little things did not add up which led to me confronting her. She lied and lied until eventually when I said something like ""but I could understand if you lied because we got in an argument and I would understand if you needed space"", then finally she admitted that yes she lied to me about going to work because she wanted space. 

She said that she ran errands, hung out with a couple whom I've met, and took a train into the city to see an old friend to get her Macbook fixed.

Most of her guy friends are past hookups so I asked about the old friend and it was a dude  named Brandon and I never heard her mention that name before.

She initiated contact with him, and her text convo was like this:


Her: im sad

Him: hmm gimmie the context

Her: but im just sad. He was the closest I was looking for in a relationship. But sigh, I cant. Anyway what you up to the next couple of days we can hang out or get coffee

Him: right but what time?


Her last instagram post from 2 weeks ago is a picture of us together, and its still up even now, so this guy Brandon would have seen that picture.

Its so suspicious that she initiated contact and first thing she tells him is insinuating that we broke up when we didnt? 

I read their entire text convo and nowhere did they talk about a Macbook

It looks so obvious but the reasons why I have doubt that she cheated is because:

1. She admitted she went to the city to see this guy when she really didn't have to, I never would have guessed that she went to the city or that this guy brandon would ever have existed ( she even has stated that she now regrets telling me this detail because its going to rummage through my head)

2. Her laptop being broken was a topic of discussion in the past and that ""an old friend that lives in the city"" gave it to her

3. She showed me the text messages. (even though she technically had a 30second window to delete some texts if she wanted to, I have no idea if she did though)

4. Aside from the photo there is literally nothing else suspicious about her text convo, the guy even talked about a girl he went on a date with

She refuses to admit that this guy was a past hookup which I have a strong feeling is a lie due to seeing some of her instagram comments on his pics from 2021 when they met.

I'm building an RTD protein coffee and I need your help to get it right.

Here's the problem: Every time I want a good coffee, it's either:

* A cafe-bought coffee that costs ₹150+ and has zero protein
* A protein shake that tastes chalky and kills my afternoon vibe
* Some sugary ""coffee drink"" that's basically dessert

**None of these work.** I want something that actually tastes like good coffee, doesn't bloat me, and keeps me fueled for 4+ hours.

So I'm building it: A 250ml RTD Can with 10-12g Protein, 75mg Caffeine, zero added sugar, and targeting ₹80-99.

Think of it as: **Cold Brew meets Protein, but without the trade-offs.**

I need to validate three things before I launch:

1. **The Price**: Would ₹80-99 feel like a daily habit or a treat?
2. **The Taste**: Do you want it to taste like crisp black coffee or creamy like a cafe latte?
3. **Where You'd Buy It**: Office pantry? Gym? Quick commerce? Transit hub?

I've made a quick Google Form (2 minutes, no personal stuff) to gather data and prove to manufacturers that people actually want this.

Here's the form: [Google Form](https://forms.gle/hAah7RfXRfbaeZqG9)

☕️🚲 Happy to see the return of pre and post ride coffee at flagships. Does anyone know when this returns?

Super sad to see Miami, Chicago, and Boulder go. I can’t imagine those stores being “slow” especially MIA with year round cycling 

📧The email: 
“Happy New Year.

2025 was a milestone: a decade of the RCC. It was a moment to reflect on ten years of history, but more importantly, to recentre the Club at the absolute heart of Rapha as we move into a new era.

As much as I enjoy riding alone, it’s not the same as riding together. Over the last twelve months, being back on the road with you has reminded me why. Whether it was the Kyoto Summit or our first Members’ Week, seeing the committed, pioneer spirit of this community first-hand has been a highlight of my time so far as CEO.

Last year, I promised that product leadership and your membership experience were my top priorities. We are starting to hit our tempo now. This February, we’re launching a suite of improved, exclusive benefits, from the return of specialised insurance to free pre and post-ride coffee, making sure your membership is rewarding every single day.

The Tour Down Under always feels like the moment the season truly starts. Later this month in Adelaide, we’ll be debuting our all-new RCC kit. I’m incredibly excited to unveil our squad of elite riders racing for the RCC, including some very familiar new faces joining the Club, one of whom may or may not have worn a Maillot Jaune in the last two years.

We’re also doubling down on exclusive experiences. We’ll build on the success of Kyoto with a Summit in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and Rapha Films is proud to present 525: The Unstoppable Eddy Merckx. This is a special one, the first time Eddy and his family have ever gone on camera for a documentary like this. We’ll be hosting exclusive screenings for RCC members to tell the story of the greatest to ever do it.

On the product side, we’re building momentum. Following the impact of Pro Team III and Shadow this year, 2026 will see the most significant evolution of our Classic range yet, using all-new materials sourced from the finest European textile mills. Alongside this, brand-new updates to our Brevet and Pro Team collections will be arriving. We are also unveiling our debut collection with USA Cycling as the journey toward LA 2028 begins in earnest.

We’ve also seen our new Clubhouse in Shanghai become a true home for the local cycling community. I can’t wait to see that spirit continue to grow before we bring a similar energy to our new space in Bentonville later this year.

I’ve heard your feedback, and I’m determined to keep pushing. I look forward to sharing the road with you soon.

Let’s go.”

Came back from Costa Rica a week ago and thought I’d share my honest review of my experience, given that this sub had been so helpful to me for months after I booked my tickets to come to this beautiful country. My trip was from Dec 26 (AM, took the red eye from the US) through Jan 3. Family of 5, kids ages 6-15.

First- Costa Rica \*is\* incredibly expensive. I come from a very HCOL area in the US, have traveled extensively, and even I was taken aback by how expensive it was, people are not kidding. I think I understand why it’s so jarring- for the prices that we are charged, I would have expected better infrastructure, honestly, and better quality of things- goods, roads, hotels, food, etc. The prices do not match what you get, I’m sorry. And, it gets scammy (more on that in MA post).

12/26 7AM: Landed in SJO and headed to Immigration. That didn’t take too long, though there was one person working the booth and they kept prioritizing everyone \*but\* passengers, so that was annoying. After that you’re forced through a duty free shop 🙄 but we quickly found our transfer. I read that there are a bunch of aggressive drivers trying to get you to take their service- I guess, but it’s nothing like landing in Puerto Vallarta in MX, it’s easy to just ignore and go find your way. No one jumps at you like they do in other airports.

We took a private shuttle to La Fortuna. I opted not to rent a car because I just didn’t want to deal with having to drive and navigate difficult roads, confusing directions and rules. It was a hard year and I just wanted someone else to worry about that. We used ILT Costa Rica for all of our transfers and they were great- air conditioned comfortable vans with wifi. Drivers were excellent. 

We stayed at Arenal Country Inn- beautiful property, accommodations were fine. The beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable but the room was clean, the pool area was nice, the staff was lovely. Breakfast every morning. Would have liked to have had coffee or water in the room but it’s fine.

Ubers are available in La Fortuna, but only for 4 passengers, so that didn’t work for us. We had excursions where we got picked up but took taxis a couple of times and that was easy and affordable.

Excursions:

First day: LF Waterfall, Arenal 1968 hike, Mistico Hanging Bridges, hot springs

I will say- when I booked the tour, I chose the 3 in 1 package but somehow we got the hot springs part. The day was too long. If I knew better, I would have split it. LF Waterfall was “ok”. Too many people. The waterfall was lovely but… no different than other waterfalls I’ve seen. Arenal hike was a lot of fun, but you need energy for it. Unfortunately, it started pouring the last 10 minutes of our hike so by the time we got to the top- we were engulfed in rain clouds and didn’t see a thing, which was a bummer, but you can’t control nature. Of course, it cleared up after we descended but oh well. On that hike we saw sloths and monkeys. It was beautiful and we enjoyed it. Lunch was served and it was good.

Mistico Hanging Bridges was a lot of fun and though my phobic daughter struggled at first, eventually she relaxed. Again, more animals to see and the views were amazing.

Hot springs- could have skipped, cool to experience the warm water but it’s off a busy road, and it’s busy between tourists and locals. Maybe my view of that is a bit skewed because I was really tired. 

Second day: Peñas Blancas River Safari float and Ecotermales Hot Springs- family favorite!

The river float was so much fun, it was relaxed and we got the raft just for the family, which is great. Saw a bunch of monkeys (got peed on), birds, reptiles, and just overall had a lovely experience. I would do it again. 

Ecotermales was awesome- beautifully set up, the pools were great (1st pool was the hottest and then it gradually got a little cooler with each pool). The dinner was so good. Everyone loved it.

Third day: Don Olivo Chocolate tour and a Night Walk

Took a taxi to both, no problem. The chocolate tour was really good- chocolate, coffee, and sugar cane. We got to try a bunch of fruits, tried some sugar cane, had a shot of the strongest rum i’ve ever had in my life, and my kid and husband ate termites (yep). It was very informative and the kids liked it. Went back to the hotel and relaxed, headed into town for a bit.

Night walk- It was “ok”. I think if people are really into creepy crawlies they’d be fascinated; I was only there for the frogs and just really wanted to see the red-eyed frog (I did, very cool) but honestly it was a little boring.

La Fortuna town: seems set up for tourism, there are lots of ice cream shops, tourism booths, and souvenir shop after souvenir shop. The shops had all the same stuff, nothing interesting. I always look for ornaments and everything was just so generic and cheap looking. Picked up a couple of things just to have from La Fortuna but there isn’t much to do in the town. Easy to get to and lots of restaurants to choose from.

Next day was transfer to MA, so I’ll post more in a separate post later. What I will say so far is that LF area is worth it, it’s beautiful, and there’s so much to do.",5,1768056037.0,CostaRicaTravel,20,0.63,False

So the new meta is this: get a small cup, fill it with the large setting, purchase then pour into your travel mug and add the packets of creamer you grabbed since you made a purchase.  



You get a slightly less volume than the large, but more than a normal small since you filled the cup to the brim and will add creamer in after.  And you get the good portion of the coffee pour.  Then you can point this out to the cashier and ask if I can just use my travel mug from the get go and 9 times out of 10 they will agree, it saves them a cup and lid after all.

1q95nbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/1q95nbf/another_what_should_i_buy_thread/,"Another: ""What Should I Buy"" Thread?","I know you love it. Grab yourself a coffee, I'm going to ramble for a bit.

One thing I really appreciate about Reddit, is that I can come up with a comparison of any lens, and there will already be a discussion on it. Let me share what I have, and what my goals are, as far as building a ""quiver"" for myself. I would more than welcome any feedback or suggestions.

For years, I have been wanting to get into photography, and have dabbled as much as my budget could allow. I'm in a place now, where I can afford to spend some money to get some decent gear.

About a year ago, I pulled the trigger on on a low shutter-count Sony AC7, that I got a great d\*\*l (I can't put that word in a post?) on. I immediately bought a polarizing filter for the kit 28-60mm lens. The plan was to get primarily into wildlife photography, so the next purchase was going to be the Sony 200-600, or Sigma 150-600 telephoto lens. I hunt, so the plan is basically to get geared up in my camo, and sneak around in the woods, shooting animals in a different way. Then my dog started limping, and I spent the money on knee surgery for her (she's a very good dog).

Ok, no biggie. I still have a great camera, and I should learn how to use it. I also hike and travel quite a bit. I sprung for a cheap Viltrox 20mm f2.8 (with a polarizing filter for that. Do we like polarizing filters for all our lenses?) and a cheap tripod, and went at it. I did a bunch of hiking, did a couple weeks on Haida Gwaaii, and then recently a few days in Toronto. I've been learning the controls on my camera, and have been trying to get creative with my shots. One thing I have discovered about myself, is that I am just as interested in city/street photography, as wildlife photography.

And so now I am once again in a position to buy my 200-600mm. I chose that over the Sigma, just because the used market is in my price range and I like the features on the Sony. I'm going to do that in the next couple weeks. I realize that the A7C isn't the ideal camera for that lens. The long term goal there, is to save up and have a dedicated wildlife camera, but still keep the A7C for travel. I'm for sure going to buy this lens.

We're going to Vietnam and Thailand this Summer, and we try to hit up a North American city every year (we're from BC.) I kind of want to upgrade my travel lenses as well. I likely won't lug that big telephoto internationally, unless I'm going specifically for birding or whatever. I really like the 20mm lens, but when I was in Toronto, sometimes I wish I had something a little narrower.

So my thoughts are:

1. Tamron 70-300mm F/4.5-6.3 Di III RXD. It seems inexpensive, light, and fairly versatile. 300mm means I can still get some wildlife shots, as well as the reach I wish I had when I was traveling in 2025. From the reviews I have read, it seems like a great travel lens. At the price-point, I feel comfortable trying it out for a couple years, and upgrading if I feel like I want something more out of it.
2. Sony FE 40 mm F2.5 G. I've been trying to shoot my 28-60mm at 40mm to get an idea on what it would be like to use this prime lens. I could definitely get behind this li'l fella. The size and weight seem like it would be perfect for my A7C. This would likely be my main travel lens, with the Tamron being used when I need it. I could probably pull off the Sony FE 35mm F1.4 GM, but it would mean either not getting the Tamron this year, or crushing some overtime shifts.
3. Something in the wide angle range. I love the Viltrox 20mm, but it is for sure a cheap lens. The vignetting can be pretty annoying. This will be in the future, but I would like to upgrade this lens.

So what do you think? Is the general plan sound? I feel like I could research forever, and never land on the perfect setup. I am open to suggestions.

I know the number isn't everything, but how is it not moving at all? I roughly track my calories and I know I'm in a deficit, although maybe it's not big enough? All I know is for how much I'm doing, I don't get how I'm still squishing my legs and seeing the number go up. I'm not so discouraged that I'm going to give up, but I'm just baffled. What could I be doing wrong? Is there any advice to help me get the needle moving a little faster? Sorry for the long post, but I hope the context was helpful in getting any answers. I'm thankful for any advice I can get!",3,1768055735.0,WeightLossAdvice,5,0.72,False

So I met her in college, graduated and we both became professionals in a short period of time. We live about 30mins. away from each other pero sobrang dalang magkita. Right now ang laki ng tampo ko sakanya. Tuwing aayain ko siya magmeet, lagi siyang busy or tight sa budget. Don't get me wrong, alam kong valid yung reason niya kasi I go through it din at naiintindihan ko siya kaya I let her be. Ang tampo ko lang is parang same day or two after ng aya ko, nasa labas siya grabbing coffee or eating out with other friends niya. So anong mararamdaman ko dun? She claims I'm the best friendship she's ever had pero bakit ngayon hindi ko naman dama? Now I'm starting to think na baka ako yung problema? Pero in my defense, kahit nasasaktan ako sa mga kilos niya na ganon, scheduling meet ups/hangouts with her other friends tapos pag dating sakin busy na siya, hindi ko siya pinagsasalitaan ng di maganda. So dahil masakit sa dibdib, I created space. I stopped replying, and ngayon, parang siya pa yung galit at hindi rin ako pinapansin. Yung recent niyang aya is before the end of 2025, kaso I had other plans din kaya di natuloy and honestly...it just doesn't sit right with me anymore. I think she's outgrown me?

She gathered a few old friends who were into music and installation art and rented an almost forgotten abandoned ranch in Nevada. She wanted to give it a try: if people were liberated from Wi-Fi and deadlines, would inspiration come knocking on its own? 



In the end, inspiration didn't come, but a sandstorm did. What was worse, the few old AI writing assistants they brought along kept crashing in the power outage and high-temperature environment. Just as everyone was about to pack up and admit defeat, the composer Marco had a sudden idea: ""Since the AI keeps crashing, why not teach it to adapt to this place?"" 



They built a makeshift power station with solar panels, localized the deployment of an AI model, and wrote a small program that could generate melodies based on the sounds of desert winds, the rhythm of lizards crawling, and even the boiling of coffee pots. Unexpectedly, this crude ""DIY AI"" sparked an unprecedented burst of creativity - Lynn wrote a novel about a machine dreaming of cacti, and Marco composed an electronic symphony with a gritty texture. 



The news spread like wildfire. An AI ethics researcher who had been fired from a major tech company in Silicon Valley arrived, bringing with her a chatbot trained to write haikus. A couple of digital artists who had faced setbacks with their exhibitions in Europe also showed up in a camper van, filled with sensors capable of creating paintings based on emotional data. During the day, everyone worked on repairing circuits, growing vegetables, and debugging code. At night, they gathered around the campfire, listening to humans reciting poems and also to the AI reciting its ""understanding"" of loneliness. 



Gradually, some people stayed on. Some built the first small house with soundproof walls and GPU servers, while others set up an open-air projection theater on the dried-up riverbed. The local government, seeing that these ""strange people"" neither disturbed the residents nor caused any harm but instead attracted tourists, simply allocated a piece of land and offered lenient policies: as long as you don't harm others, you can create in any way you like with AI here. 



So, BrilionX just grew up like this - not planned, but nurtured by a group of creators who were unwilling to be mere ""users"", using code, paint, musical notes, and a bit of stubbornness from the wild. 



Today, on the crooked wooden sign at the entrance of the town, the original words are still engraved: ""Here there are no geniuses, only those who are willing to clumsily try along with the machines.""",2,1768055673.0,SportTrade,0,1.0,False

Zain stirred the foam in the cafe, his eyes fixed on his phone. The story that led him here hadn't started with a location pin, but with a message. A post seeking something ""crazy,"" a profile promising a ""kinky queen."" His opening was polite, complimentary. Her reply was a velvet-gloved correction: ""Thanks for your well written text. But its paid if you have read my post carefully.""

The negotiation that followed was a masterclass in building false legitimacy. She was upfront: ""I do 8k for the video call and 35k per night meetup."" When he hesitated, she didn't budge. Instead, she framed it as integrity: ""I'm a woman of rules and principles. This is the best I can offer."" It was genius. A red flag transformed into a green one—honesty, boundaries, clarity. He agreed.

Then, she manufactured the perfect, urgent reality. ""My parents went to a wedding so no one to question me where I am,"" she said, creating a one-night-only window of secrecy and opportunity. The hook was set. The final instruction was precise: ""Zigxag69. This is my snapchat send me a text there and also please the screenshots of this chat there for reference."" It felt procedural, safe. He complied, moving the conversation to a platform where Reddit's oversight vanished.

On Snapchat, the theatre began. The shared location pin appeared on the apartment tower above the cafe. The snaps arrived: the steam from a shower, the question about black underwear, the instruction to wait downstairs with a latte. He was an actor in her script, believing the ""rules and principles"" were protecting them both.

The crisis, when it came, was a technical heartbreak. ""The money didn't come! My app shows nothing."" A fake screen recording ""proved"" it. The ""woman of principles"" now pleaded, then demanded, for a second payment, promising an instant refund. The push-and-pull was exhausting. When he called it a scam, she was indignantly transactional: ""Fine, just send half then.""

Sitting with his cold coffee, the post-nut clarity of grift hit him. The principles, the secrecy, the perfect timing—all were props. The entire performance, from the first message to the Snapchat map, was engineered for one moment: the request for a second payment.

Zain drove home and did the one real thing left. He compiled the evidence—the Reddit negotiation, the Snapchat handle Zigxag69, the fake screen recordings, the entire script—and filed a formal report with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA). His final message to her was simple: ""I’ve reported this and all evidence to the Police."" The block was instantaneous.

This story isn't about a transaction. It's about trust, weaponized. It shows how ""clarity"" is used to disarm, how ""principles"" are staged to deceive. If you recognise this script—the upfront fees, the rushed secrecy, the move to Snapchat, the sudden ""payment glitch""—know that you are being fed a line. Your strongest move is to break the script. Report it to the NCCIA. Turn their carefully crafted evidence into yours. Protect the next person from buying a latte for a ghost.

The people on the other end might be fake but the connected bank accounts are real and they can be tracked to the original criminals. ",0,1768055665.0,IslamabadSocial,5,0.5,False

I’m building my first “serious but practical” filter coffee setup and I’d love some feedback from people more experienced than me.

I’m currently considering this combo:
	•	Fellow Opus burr grinder
	•	Cuisinart 14-Cup drip coffee maker (programmable)

My needs:
	•	Daily use, no manual brewing every morning
	•	Drip / filter coffee (not espresso)
	•	Enough capacity to brew ~500–700 ml per day (one cup at breakfast + one to take to work in a thermos)
	•	Programmable timer so I can wake up with coffee ready
	•	Decent build quality, consistent results
	•	Small-ish kitchen, so footprint matters
	•	I also occasionally brew moka, so grinder versatility is a plus

Budget:
	•	~300€ total (EU based)

I know machines like Moccamaster are considered top tier, but the lack of a timer is a big downside for my routine. That’s why I’m leaning toward a good drip machine + a proper burr grinder instead of an all-in-one solution.

Do you think this combo makes sense for my use case?
Any major downsides I should be aware of?
Or alternative suggestions in the same budget?

2TB of cloud storage by itself costs about $10/month.

That’s also what Dropbox charges for 2TB.

• Gemini built directly into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Meet

• NotebookLM with higher limits for working with your own documents

• AI image generation with higher quotas

• AI video generation tools (Flow, Whisk, etc.)

• Priority and higher rate limits in Antigravity compared to free users

• Faster refresh cycles than free tier

• Gemini Code Assist and CLI with higher request caps

• Jules coding agent with higher task limits

• AI features in Google Search and Deep Research

• Google Home AI features like extended camera history (where available)

• Family sharing for storage and many AI benefits

• Early access to new Google AI experiments

 1. Reduced brew tenmp at PID to 89 C and reduced OPV to 9.5 bar on the dial 
2. Yield to 34 grams instead of 36 g coffee out to avoid the last couple of seconds of bitter compounds. 18g in - 34 g out in about 22 seconds. 

Any advice on below pls: 
1. The pressure dial fluctuates a little (video) not much though - is this normal?

1q95ehy,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q95ehy/fruit_of_the_womb/,Fruit of the Womb,"There was a metal windmill on our farm that lulled me and my sister to sleep every night.

She didn't like the creaking wheel: the rusted iron that contracted from heat loss with a gasping hitch and sigh.

*crack-swish-crack-swish...*

""It sounds like a spade hitting dirt..."" Thandi whispered, ""like it's burying a corpse...""

Her albino-blue gaze shifted from the window to me; her irises glinting like a lizard's eyes in the moonlight.

My fingers tightened in my bedsheets.

*""Sleep, sister,""* I said in Zulu, *""Before the ancestors listen, and the stars twist your words...""*

She sighed and turned onto her side on the top bunk bed.

I tried to breathe quietly after that, ignoring how the celestial bodies burned against the night. The wheel of the windmill grated against its gearbox.

Usually, the weary sound was a comfort. But tonight? Tonight, I remembered my father shoveling the earth under the windmill at midnight ... I closed my eyes, but memories clawed forward and hushed questions traced my skull like skinned fingers.

Sleep escaped me until the hexing hour. Even then, I could not flee the unease shredding my thoughts.

I dreamed of my grandfather. A good man with a quiet life. A witch doctor who had been institutionalized in my junior year of high school. No one took his 'delusion diagnosis' seriously. His prophecies always came true.

But here, in my mind, he was... happier. Sober.

I sat on the patio with my best friend, Sifiso discussing school and village life with the witch doctor.

My sister brought us plates of peppermint crisp tart. A Sunday Tradition.

Sifiso thanked her and she averted her gaze. She blushed like a summer sunset.

My grandpa reached for a square of peppermint crisp--- Thandi grabbed his hand.

""Tell us about the star people, *mkhulu*..."" she said as her pale fingers brushed over his scarred knuckles.

The old man's cataract-infested eyes narrowed, and he tilted his head with a hum.

""The celestial lights speak in the darkness of the mind... inside the body... and the quiet night."" He retracted his hand as he went into a trance-like state.

I shivered at his words, glancing at Sifiso---

""They wanted my eyes,"" my grandfather murmured. ""To see humanity.... To creep closer to our world through flesh...""

My blood chilled, yet my sister smoothed her apron, unfazed. She mentioned something-something about 'brewing coffee'.

I crossed my arms to cover the goosebumps that prickled my skin. ""Coffee... yeah, thanks.""

The dream ended quietly after that.

But, sometimes, I recount the witch doctor's words from my liminal state. Sometimes, I look back on those... 'memories'.

And I wonder about Thandi who had downy white hair like a newborn goat and had bleary-blue eyes that were red-rimmed in the sunlight-- like a woman who cried too much to her ancestors.

She was a strong Zulu girl and old enough to accept *lobola* from my best friend's family.

Their wedding was in winter. 9 PM.

The timing felt... wrong. I never went. Sifiso said I was being unreasonable and Thandi begged me to reconsider but I refused. We never spoke again.

After they left for their honeymoon, I asked my mother about Thandi's wedding. She must have attended, right?

My mother's hands stilled in the soapy dishwater.

""Ah--- *Thandi*? Do you mean the fruit of my womb. The child who died thirteen weeks into growing?""

She wiped her hands off her apron, ""*Your father buried her under the windmill. It'll be 22 years this winter...*""

*""Haa, Ma, you lie,""* I shook my head. *""She and Sifiso are in Cape Town, celebrating.""*

*""Sifiso? Sifiso Dlamini?""* Her eyes widened. *""You speak of a boy that drowned a long time ago. There is no Sifiso...""*

But for me, Thandi and Sifiso's flesh had breathed all those years in false memories. 

They were star walkers who wore the dead like winter coats.

Just wondering how long did everyone else’s machine last?

I currently have a vertuo pop+ that i bought almost 2 years ago (March 2024). 
I only drink one pod per day. Rarely 2. 
Have ran a water rinse cycle every weekend. And descaled it every few months or so (the descaling light never came on but i did it anyway)

Just this week out of nowhere my coffee is tasting burnt and bitter. I noticed today that it is brewing hotter than usual also. 
I plan to descale it tomorrow and see if it goes back to normal. 

But if that doesn’t happen, are there any other solutions/ideas?

Help!,"I know the title sounds dramatic, but I’m honestly not sure how else to describe it. It’s something we’ve struggled with for most of the duration of our relationship, and sometimes I think the only way we’ve lasted as long as we have is we’ve avoided hard conversations. 

We originally met on Hinge for a coffee date. She was, transparently, way out of my league. While I was more attractive and active when I was younger, somewhere in adulthood I got lazy behind a desk job and gained a ton of weight. I hadn’t had a real relationship since 2017, moved across the country at some point, and decided about a year ago it was time to work on myself. I lost about 50 lbs and rejoined the dating pool, and after a couple misfire dates matched Marie (fake name).

The problem is that we don’t seem to agree on much of anything, big or small. Politics? I’m a progressive that would make Bernie blush, she’s a Libertarian that still has Ron Paul signs in her apartment. Schedules? I’m a traditional 9-5 and get anxiety being 2 minutes late anywhere while she works overnights and never heard of an itinerary. Sex life? She prefers power imbalances and dom/sub play where I’m more vanilla. She even made fun of me a bit over my concern for consent. 

Those are the big things, but even the small, day to day things have been rough. She liked FPS and fighting games, I’m more of an RPG nerd. I like cooking meals for her, she has maybe 3 plates at home. I’m an extrovert with a large friend group, she has a few colleagues she talks to but otherwise keeps her circle at arms length. I am a regular moderate drinker (2-3 a week), I’ve never seen her drink a drop. 

The only thing we’ve managed to connect over seems to be social media. She has worked very hard to build a solid instagram and TikTok following, and while I’m not as big as I used to be, have a pretty large Twitch presence. She’s been encouraging me to be more active there, I think, because it’s easier for us to relate over our social media presence. And I didn’t even realize it until our second date, but I had already followed her on TikTok, which has been a laugh for us both. 

Things got awkward last night talking about recent events in Minnesota. I mentioned it felt like a turning point, even the handful of more centrist or conservative commentators I’ve seen around were condemning it. She said things were “more 50/50” and can understand the actions of the officer. I got mad, saying I can’t “both sides” this. She was more defensive, saying there wasn’t anything we could do about it, so no reason to get upset by it. That seemed defeatist to me, but I had learned these discussions go nowhere. She also seemed to think she had “more balanced algorithms” since she was only getting neutral analysis videos, whereas my feeds are filled with “outrage bait.” I try hard to be understanding, but I am also tired of always being the one to give ground. 

I think we are both at an age where we are genuinely worried about being alone. And our conversations are fun when we keep them loose and light. But I’m tired, boss. I’m not fulfilled emotionally, spiritually, sexually… and I feel selfish for asking for more. 

A big part of the sexual issues come from the fact she is transgender. While she has said she wants to have penetrative sex, she’s nervous about it, as she’s never had it. I know enough never to push someone for something they aren’t comfortable with. And she does say thank you for my patience. But at this point, it feels like I’m beating my head against a brick wall. 

Any advice on what to do, conversations to have, etc. I’m just tired. ",1,1768055115.0,relationshipadvice,3,1.0,False

The problem? These images have massive dark backgrounds that drain printer ink like crazy.

So I built save.ink over the weekend. It optimizes images for printing by removing unnecessary dark areas and adjusting contrast. Claims up to 70% ink savings (your mileage may vary depending on the image).

Features:
•  3 presets: Documents, Dark Mode Screenshots, Maximum Savings
•  100% client-side processing (images never leave your browser)
•  Export as PNG, JPG, or PDF
•  No login, no ads, completely free

Tech stack: Next.js, Canvas API for image processing.

The interesting part: deployment

I used Claude with Computer Use to deploy the entire thing. I told it ""deploy this to Vercel with the domain save.ink"" and watched it:

•  Open Chrome
•  Navigate to Vercel, create project, connect GitHub repo  
•  Wait for build
•  Open Spaceship, configure DNS records
•  Go back to Vercel to verify domain

I literally just watched and sipped coffee. It asked me a few confirmation questions when it got stuck, but otherwise handled everything.

This felt different from ""AI writes my code."" This was ""AI clicks my mouse."" Deployment and platform configuration used to take hours. Now I can outsource that to AI too.

Takeaways:

1. Best side projects come from real problems. I was annoyed by ink costs for a month before finally building this.
2. AI is changing the entire workflow, not just coding. From ideation to deployment, AI can participate in every step now.
3. Small tools have value. This isn't revolutionary, but it solves a real (small) problem. The internet has many of these niche needs.

What's the worst that can happen? They're never going to call me anyway.

BUT ALAS! Got the email to book a spot earlier this week and booked it immediately (it was a first comes kind of basis) and thank goodness I took the time I did because it gave me a lil moment to clear my head and have a warm creamy coffee to ease my throat.

It was, honestly, a whirlwind. I got in with my little music score, gave it to the pianist, said hi to the panel (the composer was there?! 😭) and we had to actually try a few times the start of the song because - who knew pianos would be THAT loud oh my goodness, I felt like a tiny mouse. AND THEN IT WAS SHOWTIME!

I honestly have literally just flashes of my performance, I hope I sang the right lyrics because my mind was making me move instinctively,  I only remember being so concentrated on stopping my hands from trembling? But I am very proud because that last note was the highest of the piece and I SMASHED IT. It felt so so liberating??? My shower walls could never.

After that I think we did some aural tests, just like, the pianist would push a key and I had to repeat the note, and then we did an arpeggio.

AND THEN! We did the actual acting part and I completely forgot to position myself where they told me to out of panic, but I think I was ok-ish, if they needed to record that I hoped someone moved the camera or something.

I am so tired now, but like, proud tired. I pushed myself so much out of my comfort zone and it feels so incredibly good, regardless if I get in or not. I already feel like a winner because I went there and did my best.

I think, my favourite part was being in the metro and looking around me and thinking to myself 'everybody is going their own ways but nobody knows I am going to my very first audition ever'. It felt special and I hope to keep this memory with me forever.",18,1768054863.0,offmychest,8,0.96,False

This is my first time getting fired and I have no clue what to do now. Half rant half asking for advice.


I was an assistant manager at a coffee shop and I do have to admit that I hate my DM. She is unrealistic and always felt like she was on my case about something I wasn’t doing. I had been written up a while ago for “not performing my duties” (Even though the work load that I was given was meant for 2 people and was never properly told how to do my job) and for asking somebody to come in 30 minutes early when we were swamped (Once again, was never told I couldn’t do this). From what I was told it sounded like the latter was the main reason for the write up.


I was called about 30 minutes ago from HR saying that somebody made a report about being concerned that I made violent threats. I am a very dramatic person and I admit that I have made multiple jokes before about how I’m going to blow up corporate with a bomb or find my DM and beat her up. Which is absolutely unprofessional on my end, but to be fair I’ve heard the same kind of jokes come from my coworkers as well. Their call had woken me up so I didn’t ask about the specifics of the termination, I was embarrassed and scared and was nervous I’d say something that I’d regret because I was groggy from just waking up. They told me I was going to get an email and if I had any questions I could email them.


I don’t know what to do now. I was already looking for other jobs because of how much I hated this one, but I can’t get unemployment or any other kind of security net.
