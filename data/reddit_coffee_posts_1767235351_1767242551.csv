1q0vv3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1q0vv3u/speculative_ideaconversation_what_will_our/,Speculative idea/conversation: what will our 'perception' of reality be like in the future? How augmented will it be?,"I've been thinking about how future technology might change our perceptions very drastically. If you look at the present day, a lot of our perceptions and ideas are derived from digital media and digital content. I would say that we've gone from scanning our environment and exploring physical space; to scanning the digital realm and exploring dopamine inducing content or philosophy/ideas.

  
I wonder in the future how will we experience things, for example now we can organize things much faster, I can find a date on Tinder within 5 minutes, order my coffee remotely, organize services at home; and in some cases instantly reject services or commitments I've made.

  
In the future rather than making a Facebook group for 'going on long walks', perhaps technology will read your body and your posts/content you consume, detect that you want to walk, detect that you want to be sociable and pair you up with someone who is a minute walk away from you, without you proactively searching for that activity. Our perception of how we use our time and how quickly things can be done may be changed.

  
Virtual reality is another example I can think of, at some stage with advanced computer-brain interfaces, perhaps we'll be able to live in fully simulated worlds. We could visit the Byzantine empire, live in the pokemon world, live in a world in which we are the God of that world in creative mode. Our perception will be inevitably changed something like this, opening us up to new forms of thoughts, combinations of sensations and possibilities. It may even be the case that our processing speed is dramatically increased, meaning we could experience 1000 days in a virtual world, whilst only passing one day on Earth.



Furthermore, how advanced will technology get, if the multiverse/many universes theory is correct, will we be able to teleport to our own customised universe?

  
Food for thought, let me know of any ideas you may have and your thoughts.

So much that I forgot what credit card I was pissed about. I just know they show two guys walk into a bakery/coffee shop/whatever. One dude says he's paying and pulls out some cash but the other guy offers to pay with a credit card. Everyone cheers.

WTF? So, this ad says it's better to use a credit card where you'll have to pay interest than to use cash for a simple purchase.? For what? POINTS? Do you think that this company is giving you money? FFS it pisses me off. 

And Rocket Money can KMA. They have another commercial with a girl that is so badly edited it will give you a seizure. ",2,1767242338.0,CommercialsIHate,0,1.0,False

1q0vpp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1q0vpp9/parents_brining_up_childhood_things_to_justify/,Parents brining up childhood things to justify mistreatment,"I'll preface by saying that I have very good parents who did a lot to ensure I was set up well. Currently 32M and the parents came to visit this week (own my house in a major urban city). My parents have always somewhat treated me as if I am still a child even though I have not been financially supported by them since I left high school (division one scholarship athlete, graduated to a 6 figure job and worked my way up from there). 

  
Tonight my mom was sleeping on the couch while we were watching TV and I asked her if she wanted to go to bed because she was sleeping and she told me to ""Shut the fuck up"" and that ""she was the adult and could go to bed when she wants"". 

I then asked her to take her shoes off the coffee table (she was wearing them and reclining her feet), to which she does what she always does, brings up the fact that when I was a kid I always messed up her stuff. 

Totally fair to point out my flaws as a child, but what seems unreasonable is using that to punish me and my fiancee's things 25 years down the line. 

I am at the point where I want to tell her that if she cannot respect me and treat me as a fully-functioning adult, she is no longer welcome at our wedding in May and I will no longer speak to her. Not sure if anyone has been through this with a super narcissistic parent before, but please let me know. 

\*\*\* As additional context\*\*\* 

I have a 37M brother who does not have a full time job, gets financially supported by my parents, and they treat him like an angel. Never understood if it was guilt or just the fact that parents do in fact have favorites. Thanks for any suggestions of how to deal with this. ",1,1767241866.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1q0vpm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1q0vpm3/i_didnt_apply_for_the_internal_role_part_1/,I didn’t apply for the internal role. (Part 1),"The alarm went off at 6:30. I didn’t wake up right away. I never do.

For a few seconds, I was convinced that I could just stay there. That if I stayed really still and didn’t leave the bed, the day wouldn’t start yet. The ceiling above my bed has a faint crack running from the corner toward the light fixture. I have watched it long enough to know exactly where it fades out. I don’t remember when I noticed it the first time. Just that it has always been there when I needed something to stare at.

I hit snooze.

When the alarm went off again, that was the one I actually woke up to. Not because it was louder, just because by then the math had already settled in. If I didn’t get up now, I would be late. If I were late, I would lose the overtime hours. If I lost the overtime, the bills wouldn’t line up the way I needed them to. I sighed and sat up. The floor was cold. I noticed that immediately. I always do.

I shuffled into the kitchen and hit the coffee maker without really looking at it. I had set it up the night before. Grounds measured. Water filled. Like a small gift to my future groggy self. The coffee finished brewing while I leaned against the counter and waited. It smelled fine. Not good. Not bad. Just enough caffeine to keep me conscious while I stared at a screen for the next eight hours. I grabbed the same chipped mug I’ve had since college. The handle is a little loose now. I keep meaning to replace it. I never do.

As I watched the coffee pot finish, it reminded me of a different kitchen for a moment. Smaller. Messier. Too many people packed into it at once. Back when coffee meant staying up late on purpose. I was in college then. I remember thinking I was exhausted all the time, which now seems funny. I had no idea what tired actually felt like yet. I drank terrible coffee back then too. Burnt. Too strong. Always cold by the time I finished it. But it felt different. It felt like fuel. I had plans then. Not big cinematic ones. Just enough to feel like I was moving toward something. I remember sitting in a lecture hall one morning, half asleep, writing ideas in the margins of my notebook instead of taking notes. Nothing concrete. Just possibilities. I thought I would figure things out as I went. I truly believed that. I believed effort mattered. That showing up would eventually turn into momentum. That if I kept trying, even badly, something would open up. I don’t remember what I thought that something was. Just that it felt close.

The coffee maker clicked off, and the sound pulled me back. Same kitchen. Same counter. Same mug with the loose handle. I took a sip. It tasted fine.

I don’t think that version of me was wrong. I think they just didn’t know how long eventually could be. Standing there in my kitchen, holding mediocre coffee, I didn’t feel bitter. I felt patient. Like maybe I hadn’t missed my chance. Like things don’t stop being fixable just because they take longer than you expected. While the coffee cooled, I checked my phone. No messages. No missed calls. Just the usual reminders. Payments due. Pending. Overdue. I have gotten a few disconnect warnings over the past couple of months. Nothing serious yet. Still fixable. That is what mattered right now. Everything was still fixable.

“I am not unhappy.”

I needed to say it out loud. I think people confuse tired with miserable. I have a job. It’s not exciting, but it is stable. I have an apartment. It is small, but it is quiet. I can pay most of my bills on time. The rest, I am working on. Some days, when I let myself think about it, I actually believe things could get better. Not dramatically. Not all at once. Just incrementally. I rinsed out the mug and set it upside down in the rack. The handle wobbled. I adjusted it.

Riley was already on the bus when I got on, sitting in the same seat by the window. She glanced up from her phone and smiled. “You’ re cutting it close,” she said. “Still counts,” I told her. She hummed like she agreed. The ride passed quietly. Riley pointed out a new sign someone had put up near the corner store. A dog stubbornly refusing to walk. Small things. The kind you only notice when you have someone to notice them with. We got off at the stop near work and walked the last block together.

By the time we reached the parking lot, the others were already there. Julian stood a little apart, leaning against his car, watching the building like he always did. Caleb leaned against his car with a cup of coffee in hand. “Morning,” he said when he saw me. “Morning.” Paige’s car pulled in a little too fast, brakes squeaking as she slid into her usual spot. She jumped out, keys already in hand, hair still damp like she had rushed out the door. “Don’t start,” she said immediately, pointing at us before anyone could speak. “I wasn’t going to say anything,” Riley replied. “I was just going to look at you like this.” She crossed her arms and tilted her head dramatically. “Traffic,” Paige said. “Every day,” Julian added. “Same road. Same time.” “Yeah,” Paige said. “But today it was personal.”

I smiled without realizing I was doing it.

Caleb stood the way he always did. Relaxed without looking careless. Coffee cup held low, like it was part of the morning rather than something he needed. Julian stayed a step apart from the rest of us, hands in his pockets, eyes moving more than his body. Like he was already paying attention to something the rest of us hadn’t noticed yet. Paige never fully stopped moving. Even now, she shifted her weight, keys tight in her hand, hair pulled back too quickly to be intentional. Riley leaned into the moment without effort. Arms crossed loosely. Expression already halfway into a joke. She caught my eye and lifted her brows, like she saw me noticing. For a second, everything felt exactly where it was supposed to be.

Caleb took a sip of his coffee. “Anyone else think the break room coffee tastes worse when you’re already tired?” “That implies it tasted good at some point,” Julian said. “It’s not coffee,” Riley said. “It is brown encouragement.”

We all laughed. Not loud. Not forced. The kind of laugh that just happens. We stood there a few seconds longer than we needed to. No one said we were waiting. No one had to. There used to be more of us. Not all at once. One at a time. Different reasons. Different exits.

Ethan didn’t move away. Not really. He just started missing things. Then avoiding them. Then choosing work over us in a sense that felt deliberate instead of necessary. We told ourselves it was temporary. He told us it was. Eventually it stopped feeling like distance and started feeling like a decision. Grace got busy in a way that made everything else fall to the side. Archer just drifted. No argument. No goodbye. Just fewer replies until there weren’t any. Not everyone faded out quietly. One of them left, and the sound lingered. We said things we cannot unsay. And then we stopped saying anything at all.

We don’t talk about that one. We don’t need to.

Paige checked the time. We all did the same. Habit. “Alright,” she said with a sigh. “Let us go make money.” We split off toward the building. Different doors. Same place. Work passed the way it usually does. Emails. Meetings. A box of stale, store bought donuts someone brought in because it was their turn. At the end of the day, I felt tired but not empty. The good kind of tired. The kind that makes you believe rest will help.

That night, lying in the dark, I thought about the people I had stood with that morning. Riley came first, the way she usually did. She had a way of pointing things out that made the world feel bigger instead of heavier. Like there were still options I hadn’t exhausted yet. She talked about possibilities the way other people talked about weather. Casual. Inevitable. Worth noticing. Paige was harder to pin down, mostly because she never put herself in the center of anything. She just kept track. Of people. Of moods. Of when someone hadn’t shown up in a while. If the group felt steady, it was usually because she had adjusted something quietly without asking for credit. Julian noticed things before the rest of us did. Not in a dramatic way. Just small inconsistencies. Tiny patterns that didn’t quite line up. He didn’t always share what he saw, but when he did, it was because it mattered. I trusted his silences almost as much as his words.

And then there was Caleb.

Caleb was steady, dependable to a fault. The kind of person who made plans and followed through. The kind who stayed where he said he would. He didn’t talk much about the future, but when he did, it sounded like something that could actually happen.

I trusted them. All of them. In different ways. That felt important. I didn’t know why. I stared at the ceiling for a while longer, tracing the familiar crack with my eyes. Then I rolled onto my side, pulled the blanket up to my chin, and let the day go. Whatever tomorrow was going to be, I would deal with it when it arrived. For now, this was enough.

By the time Riley and I reached the parking lot the next morning, most of the others were already there. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building without really looking at it. Caleb leaned against his car, scrolling through his phone, coffee balanced easily in one hand. Paige was pacing a short line between two parked cars, like she had something she was waiting to say. “Hey,” Riley greeted everyone, lifting her hand as we approached. “Morning,” I said. Paige turned toward us immediately. “Okay. News.” That was enough to pull everyone’s attention in at once.

“Two people in my department got promoted,” she said. “Officially. New titles. Better pay.” Riley blinked. “Already? Didn’t they just restructure?” “That is what I thought,” Paige said. “But apparently they’re fast tracking some positions” she shrugged. Caleb glanced up from his phone. “They’ve been quietly posting internal listings for weeks.” He turned his phone to show the group. Julian nodded once. “I noticed that too.”

I hadn’t.

Paige looked at me. “I thought of you when I heard.” Something in my chest lifted before I could stop it. “Me?” I asked. “Yeah,” she said. “You would be perfect for something like that. You already do half of what those roles require.” Riley smiled at me like it was obvious. “She’s not wrong, ya know.” I laughed, a little embarrassed, but I didn’t deflect the way I usually would. I let the thought sit there for a second.

Maybe. The word felt dangerous and exciting all at once.

“That would be nice,” I said. And I meant it. Caleb met my eyes briefly, then nodded. “It would.” We stood there a few seconds longer than necessary, the way we always did. No one rushing. No one checking the time yet. Eventually, Paige sighed and glanced at her watch. “Alright. If we don’t go in now, I am going to be late for something I already don’t want to be at.” “Fiiiiineeeee,” Riley said with an over exaggerated sigh. We laughed, and then we split off toward the building. Still different doors. Still the same place.

The building felt the same as it always did when I walked in. Same fluorescent hum. Same muted conversations drifting down the hallway. Nothing about the place looked different. But it felt different. I caught myself paying closer attention than usual. Listening in meetings instead of just attending them. Noticing which names came up when people talked about new projects or upcoming shifts. I didn’t push myself forward. I also didn’t shrink back.

At my desk, I opened my email and scanned through the usual messages. Deadlines. Reminders. A calendar invite I had already half forgotten about. And then I saw it. An internal posting. Nothing flashy. Just a quiet line in the subject header about role expansion and departmental support. Normally, I would have archived it without thinking. Instead, I opened it. The description felt familiar. Responsibilities I already handled. Skills I had picked up over time without ever really naming them. The kind of work that didn’t feel like a stretch so much as a shift. I re-read it twice before I realized I was smiling. I didn’t apply. Not yet. But I bookmarked it. That felt like something.

Later, in a meeting that usually faded into the background, someone asked a question that no one answered right away. I found myself speaking up before I had talked myself out of it. My voice didn’t shake. No one looked surprised. The conversation moved on, but something lingered.

At lunch, Paige stopped by my desk under the pretense of borrowing a pen. “You look different today,” she said. “Different how?” I asked. She smiled. “Like you’re thinking about something.” I shrugged, but I didn’t deny it. Riley sent me a message a little later. Nothing important. Just a joke about the vending machine eating her money again. I laughed out loud before I realized I was doing it. The afternoon passed more quickly than usual. By the time my shift ended, I wasn’t exhausted in the way I normally was. I felt alert. Like I had leaned forward instead of bracing myself. Walking out of the building, I caught my reflection in the glass doors. I looked the same. But something underneath felt newly awake. I didn’t know what I was going to do with that yet. But for the first time in a while, it felt like a choice.

The bus was quieter on the way back. Most people stared at their phones or leaned their heads against the windows, the day already starting to drain out of them. Riley sat beside me like she always did, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling without really looking at anything. “You were happier today,” she said after a while. “Was I?” She nodded. “In a subtle thinking way. Not a bad way.” I watched the city slide past the window. Storefronts I recognized. Corners I could name without trying. “I think Paige might be right,” I said finally. Riley glanced at me. “About the promotion thing?” “Yeah.” She smiled, not surprised. “I told you.” I huffed softly. “You always do.” “That is because you always forget,” she said, nudging my knee lightly with hers. I thought about the posting. The bookmark. The way it had felt to speak up in that meeting without rehearsing it in my head first. “I didn’t apply,” I said. “I know.” I looked at her. “How?” “You would have told me if you did,” she said. “Or you would be panicking right now.” That was true. The bus slowed at our stop. “But,” Riley added as we stood, “you are thinking about it. And that counts.” I nodded. It did.

Paige lived in a small duplex not too far from work, the kind of place that always smelled faintly like whatever she had cooked last. When Riley and I arrived, the lights were already on and the door was unlocked. “Shoes off,” Paige called from the kitchen before we even announced ourselves. Caleb was already there, sitting at the table with a drink in his hand, sleeves rolled up like he had been helping with something. Julian leaned against the counter nearby, watching Paige move around the kitchen like he was cataloging it.

“You’re late,” Paige said, but she smiled when she said it. “We took the scenic route,” Riley replied. “There is no scenic route,” Paige said. “Exactly.”

We settled in the way we always did. Someone claimed the couch. Someone else grabbed an extra chair from the corner. Plates were passed around without asking. Conversation overlapped and doubled back on itself. At some point, Caleb handed me a drink I hadn’t asked for. “Figured,” he said with a shrug, a warm smile and a slight wink. “Thanks.” Julian asked a question that turned into a debate. Paige disappeared and came back with more food. Riley kicked her feet up onto the coffee table like she owned the place. I sat there and let it happen. At one point, Paige looked around the room and sighed, content. “I like this,” she said. “We should keep doing this even when work gets stupid.” “When?” Riley echoed. “Work is already stupid.” “True,” Paige conceded. I laughed, and it surprised me how easy it felt.

Later, when the night wound down and people started checking the time, I helped Paige stack plates in the sink. “You okay?” she asked quietly. “Yeah,” I said. “I think I am.” She nodded like that answer made sense.

Walking home later, the air felt cooler. Lighter. I didn’t know what the next step was yet. But for the first time, it felt like I didn’t have to take it alone.

Saturday passed more slowly than I expected. I cleaned my apartment in pieces, starting and stopping whenever something else caught my attention. Laundry sat folded on the couch longer than it needed to. Dishes dried in the rack while I stood there, staring at them without really seeing them.

At some point in the afternoon, I opened my laptop. I didn’t mean to look for anything specific. I just did. The post was still bookmarked.

I hovered over it for a second before clicking.

It looked the same as it had on Friday. Same title. Same careful language. Same list of responsibilities that felt uncomfortably familiar.

**Position: Operations Support Coordinator**

**Division: Internal Systems and Continuity**

**Posting Type: Internal Expansion**

The listing was hosted on Axiom’s internal board, but the footer carried a smaller line of attribution that I didn’t remember seeing before.

^(“)*^(Reviewed in alignment with First Principle Collective.”)*

The description was short. Careful. Almost intentionally plain.

**^(“Provide operational support across multiple departments during periods of transition. Maintain documentation and process consistency to reduce workflow disruption. Assist in identifying gaps, redundancies, and unresolved escalations. Act as a liaison between teams when responsibilities overlap or stall.”)**

There wasn’t anything flashy about it. No promises. No urgency. Just quiet expectations. The qualifications were worse.

**^(“Demonstrates reliability and follow through. Strong written communication and organizational awareness. Ability to work independently with minimal oversight. Comfort operating in evolving or undefined structures.”)**

I read that last line twice. I had been doing most of this already. Not officially. Not because anyone had asked. Just because things tended to fall apart if no one did. At the bottom of the posting, separated by a thin gray line, was a final note.

*^(Qualified candidates may be identified internally based on observed performance and organizational need.)*

I imagined what it would be like to do that work officially instead of incidentally. To have it recognized. To stop feeling like I was quietly proving myself to people who didn’t know they were watching. I opened a blank document. Just in case. I typed my name at the top.

*“Nicole Bennett.”*

I stared at it for what felt like hours, until a dog outside barked and snapped me back. I closed the document.

On Sunday, I tried again. This time I told myself I was just practicing. That there was no pressure. That no one would see it unless I wanted them to. I sat at my kitchen table with a mug of reheated coffee and pulled the posting up again. I reread the qualifications, nodding along like I was agreeing with something obvious.

I started drafting a message. Nothing formal. Just a note.

*“Interest expressed. Experience mentioned. Confidence implied.”*

I deleted the first sentence. Then the second. I wrote a third version that sounded too apologetic and erased that one, too. By the time the light outside shifted and the room dimmed, I had rewritten the same paragraph six times. Each version felt wrong in a different way. Too eager. Too cautious. Too confident. Not confident enough. I closed my laptop and walked away from it.

Later that night, curled up on the couch with a blanket pulled over my knees, I opened it again. One last try.

I reread what I had written and imagined hitting send. I imagined the waiting. The wondering. The second guessing every word. I imagined the email being opened by someone who already had a name in mind. My chest tightened. I highlighted the text. Deleted it. Then I closed the posting. Unbookmarked it. I told myself I would think about it again later. Sunday nights are good at that. Convincing you there is always more time. I went to bed telling myself it was fine. That I hadn’t missed anything yet. Monday morning came faster than I expected.

The alarm went off at 6:30, and this time I didn’t hit snooze. I lay there for a few seconds anyway, staring at the ceiling, tracing the familiar crack without really seeing it. My chest felt tight. Not anxious, exactly. Just alert. Like something had already started moving without asking me. I got up and moved through the routine on autopilot. Cold floor. Coffee maker. Same chipped mug. Everything where it was supposed to be. The coffee tasted the same as always.

On the bus, Riley sat beside me, scrolling through her phone with one earbud half in, the way she did when she was open to conversation but not demanding it. The city slid past the windows in a blur of corners and storefronts I could have named without thinking. “You’re quiet,” she said after a while. “I’m fine,” I said. And I meant it. Mostly. She nodded, satisfied, and turned back to her screen. I didn’t open my laptop. I didn’t think about the posting. I told myself that whatever I had felt over the weekend had settled. That I had done the responsible thing by not rushing into something I wasn’t ready for. By the time we got off the bus and walked the last block, the thought felt convincing enough to believe.

The parking lot was already half full. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building with that distant focus of his. Paige was talking animatedly about something that had happened over the weekend, using her hands like punctuation. Caleb leaned against his car, coffee in hand, listening more than he spoke. “Morning,” Riley said as we approached. “Morning,” Paige echoed. “You look awake today.” “Do I?” I asked. She smiled. “More than usual.” I reached into my pocket to check the time. That was when my phone buzzed.

Just once.

I almost ignored it. I expected a calendar reminder. A payment notification. Something automated and impersonal. Instead, I saw an email preview from an internal address I didn’t recognize. The subject line was careful. Neutral.

**Opportunity for Discussion.**

I stopped walking. Riley noticed immediately. “Hey. What’s up?” “I” I started, then stopped. Paige turned toward me, mid sentence. “What is it?” “I think,” I said slowly, looking down at my phone again, “I just got an email I wasn’t expecting.” Julian tilted his head slightly, attention sharpening. Caleb glanced over, then back at my face. “Is that good?” “I don’t know,” I said honestly. The email sat there, unopened. Waiting.

For a second, I thought about Sunday night. About the draft I had deleted. About unbookmarking the posting. About how certain I had felt that I still had time. My thumb hovered over the screen. Then I took a breath. And opened it. The email didn’t load. I tapped it once. Then again. The preview stayed stubbornly vague, replaced by a short line beneath the subject.

**This message must be accessed from a secure workstation.**

I stared at it longer than I should have. Riley leaned in slightly. “What does it say?” “It doesn’t,” I said. “It just won’t open.” Paige frowned. “Like a system error?” “I don’t know,” I said. My mouth felt dry. “It says I have to open it from a secure workstation.” Julian’s brow furrowed. “That’s not that weird. Some system messages are locked like that.” That didn’t help. Caleb tilted his head, studying my face. “You didn’t apply for anything, did you?” “No,” I said immediately. Too quickly. “I didn’t send anything.”Riley looked at me. “Are you sure?” “Yes,” I said. Then, softer, “I’m sure.” Because I was.

I remembered it clearly. Closing the document. Deleting the draft. Unbookmarking the posting. I hadn’t typed anything except my name. My name. A tight, unwelcome thought slid in anyway.

1q0vmo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1q0vmo3/medical_mystery/,Medical mystery,"38 female with a history of Crohn's disease and PCOS. Have an ileostomy. Was taking occasional Flonase/zyrtec and Afrin to deal with a mild allergy to my dog (sometimes itchy or watery eyes, or like a singular hive on my hand, but mostly nasal swelling at night). No other meds. Have had the end ileostomy for 7 years, had a loop for some years before that (swapped to end due to RV fistula that wouldn't take to repairs). Since mid October I felt as though I was choking on food intermittently. Thought maybe it was reflux.

Early October: had a ""pouchoscopy"" at my gastro (still have a jpouch that's non functional). Given all clear, no active inflammation.

13dec: had MRI with oral and IV contrast in morning to check fistula. Refused glucagon because I don't mess with peristalsis. This came back all clear, nothing new, except a hemorrhagic ovation cyst due to the PCOS. That night I was eating a donut and drinking a coffee and felt like it got stuck in my throat. Mainly left side.

14dec: X-ray at walk in clinic. They saw a mass in front of epiglottitis, sent to hospital. Feel like whatever's stuck is shifting from left side to very base of throat. Worried about airway at one point it feels blocked for three seconds  Hospital does CT, sees mass in front of epiglottitis and air/fluid in thoracic esophagus. Sent to a different hospital that had an ENT. They scope me say the mass and feeling of something stuck is just an enlarged left tonsil and send me home with Omeprazole. From here on switched myself to a soft or liquid diet at home and put Omeprazole over applesauce every morning.

16dec: morning follow up with ENT. Another scope, says my tonsil looks like it's not swollen and since it wasn't sore to me had probably been that big for a while. Says my feeling of something stuck is reflux and will go away. At home I'm monitoring my o2 because I'm scared of losing airway. I note my heart rate is 114ish nearly all day even at rest. Chalk it up to me being nervous. Watching a movie with my husband I suddenly am unable to start a swallow. My body gave the command automatically but couldn't do it which jolted my awareness to manual swallowing. Got a little dizzy. (I had three similar episodes of trouble starting a swallow high heart rate and dizziness in summer 2022 which were called anxiety). Shrugged it off and went to bed.

17dec: woke up to chest pressure. Like that's what woke me. Checked hr, already 95. Weird. Walk to kitchen to feed dog. Heart pounding out of my chest and feel awful. Check hr and it's 170. Call 911. In ambulance they said hr all over the place and something about abnormal p waves. In hospital all ekgs clear. Hr stayed 80-90 when laying down but spiked whenever I'd stand or move. Bp also spike when standing. Had about three bags of fluids and they hung potassium as a precaution but all blood work normal, echo normal, ultrasound of heart normal, troponin normal, no one ever said anything about my telemetry reads so I assume normal. Jaw pain .. so sore suddenly like I had clenched it ..Sent home on metropolol the next day. They said ""maybe it's POTS""

19dec: saw PCP who said it sounds like my nervous system. Told to stop the beta blocker and switch to verapamil. Got super dizzy that night and my BP at home was low. Food starting to feel like it's regurgitating back up to bottom of my throat. Voice hoarse occasionally.

20dec: went to er to take the verapamil as I didn't want to take it far from hospital for the first time in case my BP went low again. Monitored and sent home

22dec: tried to drink water and it immediately shot out my nose. Wouldn't go down. Waited two hours tried to take verapamil, stuck in throat. Back to ER. Ambulance driver confirmed he could see the dye of the pill in my throat. Stabbing pain, burned as dissolved. Er wait so long it dissolved on own and I went home without being seen.

23dec: had a decent day and tolerated a grilled cheese and soup (soaked the bread in the soup ). tried to have home made sloppy Joe for dinner with super fine ground beef no bread. After two tablespoons choked and stopped. 

24dec: throat progressively worse through the morning. Felt like I was choking. Only ate my applesauce with Omeprazole. Called ambulance while driving to hospital. Have been in hospital since this day with high heart rate when moving and sometimes just while resting, constant feeling of something in throat, occasional hoarse voice especially if I'm talking too much, feeling like my throat is ""too big/wide"", this sometimes minty feeling in my throat like it's too open ... Crackle sounds in the back of my throat like pop rocks? Intermittent ear pressure. Past two nights a stuffed nose/swollen nose (food/water going in nose?.. ) definitely burping and hiccuping more than ever in my life. Sometimes burping I can taste food. Definitely regurgitating sometimes. Sometimes have a random head twitch I can't control(very brief one time twitch every few days). Yesterday five minutes after eating my puree/liquid dinner I vomited hard but all that came up was white foam... And I'll be sitting in bed and all of a sudden its like I'm short of breath random times. When this happens I put on my o2 monitor (because for some reason they only check me every 4 hours) reads 93-95% a lot and theirs they only write the highest number not if it's fluctuating while it's on. I've walked to the nurses station and showed them mine and they gave me a nebulizer which helped while I was using it and not shortly after. I had one jolt on my chest that felt like my heart skipped or someone punched me and I literally doubled over.. I had just been sitting quietly in bed. Am now wearing a monitor but it's not recording it's a live feed, and honestly listening to nurses in the hall fill out overstaffed forms so idk if anyone's even watching the thing. Had a smaller jolt feeling earlier tonight but no one came in so idk. Also now having night sweats 

They did a endoscopy and biopsy for EoE and still waiting on results. Second throat CT ""normal"". I'm pushing for manometry. Barium swallow they said they saw ""a little regurgitation"" but then reported as normal (I keep flaring though and this wasnt done during a flare). They ENT scoped me again and said my voice box looked a little irritated. Blood work normal except I asked them to test b12 which was like two points under normal so we started supplements.

Current meds: verapamil, b12, Zyrtec, protonix 

I'm at a loss. Sudden achalasia? What the hell with my heart and breathing? Did I have a stroke? Sort of feels that way. Any insight would be amazing ",1,1767241581.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Woke up in HSR this morning and the street dogs were already in discussion mode. Probably reviewing their 2025. I brushed my teeth and felt like I’d completed my biggest goal for the day.

Went for a walk near Agara Lake because that’s what calm people do, or people pretending to be calm. The lake was peaceful, birds were doing bird things, couples were walking at suspiciously matching speeds. I walked alone with my earphones in, no music playing, just vibes and self-respect.

Sat on a bench for a bit. Watched joggers lap me multiple times. At one point I felt like I should clap. Everyone looked like they had somewhere to be, or someone to walk with. I just adjusted my shoelace twice to feel involved.

Came back home, made coffee, drank it standing in the kitchen like I’m waiting for a meeting invite from life. Opened Zomato, closed it, opened it again. Growth is slow but visible.

Checked a dating app. Saw bios like “here for something real” and “love long walks” while I was literally tired from a short one. Closed the app gently. Abhi main ready nahi hoon.

Now it’s afternoon. HSR is quiet. Agara Lake has moved on. I’m still here, slightly sleepy, oddly peaceful, and fully aware that this is exactly how my year would start.

1q0vjsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1q0vjsb/sharing_insight_as_mba1_m15/,Sharing Insight as MBA1 M15,"Hello everyone. I am an MBA1 student at Michigan Ross who just recently finished my first semester. I saw many questions posted on this sub to help decide which school to attend, I hope my insight can help with this, especially for aspiring MBB consultants. Please note that my insight is limited to my experience and it might differ from other schools. The insights will be on random order.

A bit background about me: International. 8-10YOE. Made poor choices in my early career, taking MBA with full-ride in order to “reset” my careers. Worked at no-brand companies before Ross.

1. If you want to recruit for MBB, lot of folks will say that they are background-agnostic. This is very far from true. Consulting cares a lot about pedigrees. Good name schools, strong GMAT, big brand working experience, and strong academic results would get you interviews.

You worked at big brand company? Great, you can afford to go to non-target school and might still land interviews.

You worked at startup outside US? Better get the M7/T15 brands.

Don’t have a good GMAT score? Hard. Even worse, average GPA? Very hard.

2. Geography, alumni networks & ethnicity could help. If you are for example, Indian, and met Indian consultant during coffee chats, you probably will be helped. Ross Alumni recruiting for Chicago is easier, than California. Pretty self-explanatory.

If you come from lesser known country, you are already way disadvantaged. I find Latin & Indian has it easier. So better spread your choices into less known office to bump your chances.

3. Some school just doesn’t have the same quality of supports for students to get jobs. For consulting, I know Darden & Ross are awesome. I know few which is not as awesome, but won’t name them here. Don’t really know M7.

4. Some school is more academically demanding than others. I know Darden and Harvard are hard academically. Ross? Not so demanding. Do your research, as it might affect your recruitment.

5. When choosing school, also consider the city. I live in a small city now & I feel it has way less distraction than my friends who went to New York.

6. Coffee chats like crazy. Some people starts before the school start. Manage yourself so you are not annoying.

7. Your background is not as awesome as you thought. Working in big4 and having CPA does not guarantee you anything. Back to point one, stack as many great pedigree as possible.

8. Always have plan B and plan C. Do not too focus only on 1 industry.

9. MBA can be lonely. Finding a place with existing support system should be on your consideration. Look on how many people from your country is in the university, how many % is international. This is not to say that international should not mingle with Americans. However, there would be a time when every Americans go home and you will stuck in the city with the internationals.

10. For other industry, it’s quite similar. Let’s say you are into Entertainment Tech, which many companies located in West Coast, aiming for UCLA & USC might be better.

I think this is top10 insight I can share. Really appreciate if you can shoot the questions on the thread instead of DMing, so everyone can help answer! Hope this helps!",1,1767241296.0,MBA,0,0.67,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Flanked by the Ritz-Carlton and the Kimpton, it occupies a geographic ""billionaire’s row,"" yet fails to translate that proximity into a premium performance. While its neighbour’s lean into refined luxury, The Melati is currently a property adrift—suffering from a profound lack of market definition and an execution that feels decidedly three-star.

The Canvas: Natural Splendour
Credit must be given where it is due: the grounds are spectacular. The property is designed around a central natural pond that anchors the lush landscape, and the descent toward the pool offers a sea view that is, quite simply, breathtaking. It is a setting that demands greatness, which makes the subsequent failures all the more frustrating.

The Critique: A Service & Culinary Void
The ""five-star"" label feels like a misnomer the moment one interacts with the operations. The property is chronically over-extended, leading to a guest experience defined by scarcity and neglect.

• Breakfast Blunders: A comedy of errors. Ordered coffee routinely fails to materialize. The culinary offering is lackluster; an ""Eggs Benedict"" served as dry eggs on soggy white bread—devoid of muffins, ham, salmon, or hollandaise—is an insult to the dish. Even the simple pleasure of a crisp chocolate croissant is absent.

• Infrastructure Strain: The ""too many guests, too little space"" theme persists throughout. There is a persistent battle for sunbeds at the pool, and the beach is far too small to accommodate the current occupancy levels.

• Waning Aesthetics: Inside the villas, the illusion of luxury fades. Decking is tired, and the furniture feels cheap and dated—hardly the sanctuary one expects at this price point.

• Logistical Lapses: For a remote property, the lack of complimentary transport is a glaring oversight. In a competitive market, failing to provide free scooters or shuttles to local towns feels penny-pinching rather than premium.

 ""At £695 per night for a Family Pool Villa, the property sits in a pricing purgatory—neither accessible enough for the budget traveler nor polished enough for the elite.""

The Verdict: The Path to Redemption
The Melati shouldn’t be compared to a Holiday Inn—the setting is far too grand for that—but it is currently catering to a ""middle-market"" crowd that favors loud poolside drinking over refined relaxation. To save itself, the hotel needs a radical repositioning.

Recommendation for the board:

1. Halve the Occupancy: Reduce room count by 50% to double the square footage of existing villas.

2. Invest in Wellness: The current gym is an outdated afterthought. Relocating and expanding it into a world-class wellness center is essential.

3. Reimagine the Kids Club: Move it away from the primary pool to a dedicated zone with planned island excursions, freeing up the beachfront for a more sophisticated atmosphere.

Final Thought: The Melati is a ""miss"" in its current form, but it remains a golden opportunity. With an aggressive renovation and a shift toward a low-density, high-service boutique model, it could stand tall next to its illustrious neighbors.

Woke up on Jan 1st to absolute silence, which in Bangalore means something suspicious is happening. Looked outside, roads were empty, delivery bikes were sleeping, and even my phone didn’t have notifications pretending to care about my existence.

Decided to make filter coffee at home. Drank it alone, standing near the window, like I’m on a tea break from a job that hasn’t started yet. Somewhere a startup founder was probably running a 10K, but my only achievement was not checking office Slack.

Later went for a short walk. Not the fitness kind, more like the “let’s remind my legs I still have them” kind. Passed a quiet café that was closed, which felt personal. Sat near Cubbon Park for a bit, watched people take photos of trees like nature is an NFT. Everyone looked busy becoming better versions of themselves. I just adjusted my backpack straps and felt productive.

At home again by noon, scrolling Zomato even though I know I’ll order the same thing I ordered last year. Opened a dating app, saw someone write “emotionally available in 2026” and closed it gently, like a laptop at 3 AM.

Thoda sa late lagta hai life kabhi kabhi, but it’s peaceful in a weird way. New year, same me, slightly upgraded operating system, still running on low battery.

# Background

* How does child care licensing work in MN?
   * The number of children on a daycare license is decided by a set out ratios of children to adult. The age of children under care determines the ratio required for the business. ([2016 Childcare Fact Sheet](https://mn.gov/dhs/assets/ratio-and-group-size-standards-for-licensed-child-care_tcm1053-340437.pdf), [State Regulation on ratios](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/9503.0040/))
   * ""David"" (Nick's guide) spends most of the video confusing the licensing maximum and the number of children under their care. David constantly says ""You have 99 children here. Where are 99 children!"" ([Example](https://youtu.be/r8AulCA1aOQ?t=761), [Example](https://youtu.be/r8AulCA1aOQ?t=990)) This is like going to a restaurant with a maximum occupancy of 300 and asking them why there aren’t 300 customers right now.

# Claims made in the video (All ""Claim"" links are timestamps)

**Overview**: Nick is led around by a guy only referred to as “David” to child care and home healthcare companies owned by people they claim are Somali individuals. Nick claims these businesses are taking part in defrauding MN/Medicaid. In a [CNN interview](https://packaged-media.redd.it/56fxolp5akag1/pb/m2-res_474p.mp4?m=DASHPlaylist.mpd&v=1&e=1767240000&s=f49605c5b186a041859392ec97572ec34d87873e) Nick admits he didn’t go to the businesses during operating hours. This whole videos also rests on the idea that these childcare business would allow a random individual [driving around in a vehicle without a license plate accompanied by masked guards into the building](https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/nation-world/inside-minneapolis-child-care-centers-accused-of-fraud-in-now-viral-youtube-video/89-cb65e37c-d6d4-48c3-831b-e95bc3d0e374) which is obviously ridiculous.

* [**Claim**](https://youtu.be/r8AulCA1aOQ?t=85): There is $8 Billion in fraud.
   * This claim echos US Attorney Joe Thompson’s claim that “half or more” of Minnesota’s 18B state spending on 14 aid programs (which are currently being audited) is possibly fraudulent. There is currently no evidence for this claim presented by Thompson [Source](https://www.kaxe.org/local-news/2025-12-19/walz-calls-9b-fraud-estimate-in-mn-run-medicaid-services-sensationalized)
* [**Claim**](https://youtu.be/r8AulCA1aOQ?t=220): Two child care businesses (Mako Childcare, Mini Childcare Center) share the same business address. 
   * Looking through Minnesota’s database of current and past licensed childcare facilities, I could not find Mako Childcare (License 1082583) shown in the video. Mako **does** show up in a MN business [search](https://mblsportal.sos.mn.gov/Business/SearchDetails?filingGuid=1e0303c3-d238-e611-816a-00155d01c56d), but it’s business was dissolved on 1/26/2023 (4 months after Mini Childcare Center’s initial childcare license was instated).
   * Mini Childcare Center filed its [original filing](https://mblsportal.sos.mn.gov/Business/SearchDetails?filingGuid=6d08a5f3-dee8-eb11-91b1-00155d32b93a) to create the business on 7/19/21. Mini Childcare Center showed up in the childcare license [search](https://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/Details.aspx?l=1111696) at the address shown in the video. There is no evidence that there are two childcare businesses at this address.
   * When David goes over the amount of money MN paid out to these businesses he shows that Mako's financials end in [FY2022](https://youtu.be/r8AulCA1aOQ?t=449) and Mini Childcare's financials start FY2023. This supports the idea that Mako shut down then Mini opened. That also undermines the claim they are both operating in the same address.
* [**Claim**](https://youtu.be/r8AulCA1aOQ?t=680): ABC Learning Center doesn’t have any children.
   * An audit in 2025 witnessed children at the [facility](https://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/Details.aspx?l=1095850). [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-day-care-fraud-director-responds/) looked at their security footage and it showed children showing up the same day that Nick visited. Nick showed no evidence of fraud.
* [**Claim**](https://youtu.be/r8AulCA1aOQ?t=1476): Creative Minds Daycare was shut down by the state and then Super Kids Daycare was opened up by the same people to get around the violations.
   * They don't provide any evidence for this claim other than the fact that one daycare closed down and another opened in the same building. 
   * The two daycares are registered to different companies. 
   * Those companies have different individuals as their managers. 
   * Super Kids Daycare [filed for their LLC](https://mblsportal.sos.mn.gov/Business/SearchDetails?filingGuid=3506c9e0-d45b-ee11-9077-00155d01c440) 9/25/2023 which is before Creative Minds even received their first violation after review on [10/20/2023](https://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/Details.aspx?l=1092663). Creative Minds wouldn't be shut down until 10/01/2025 (2 years after Super Kids formed)
   * This would have had to have been a 3+ year long plan which no evidence is presented for.
* [**Claim**](https://youtu.be/r8AulCA1aOQ?t=1597): 14 home healthcare companies are occupying the same office building.
   * I counted the sign and there's not 14 home healthcare businesses. Some are primary care. Some are home care. There's a daycare.
   * Even if they were all healthcare, this is incredibly common in the US. We don't suspect fraud when there's multiple coffee shops in the same mall, this is no different.
   * Looking into the businesses they were founded some time between 2005 and 2025 and none were owned by the same person. (I forgot to get links to all of them because this claim seemed too stupid to waste the time)

The rest of the video is more of David confusing maximum occupancy for currently enrolled student. All of the video was a lie and they present 0 evidence of fraud. The idea this was given any credit for ""pointing out a real problem"" is dumb because it's all just racist fearmongering.",0,1767240981.0,atrioc,11,0.47,False

Yesterday morning I was alone, there was a small crowd and a pick up order came in on the app that has four drinks (iced americano, iced mocha, hot latte and hot dirty matcha) 

The lady who ordered walked in 2 minutes after the order came in (I’m not even joking) and said she’s here to pick up so I said “oh sorry they’re not ready yet pls have a seat first” and she yelled at me “they’re NOT ready?! Can’t you be faster?!” which took me off guard so I did not say anything and just continued making the orders 

She was standing right in front of the counter so she saw that I also had to take new orders and attend to customers who just walked in while trying to finish making the drinks. She started walking back and forth while staring at me but I avoided eye contact bc she was honestly pissing me off. When I handed her the drinks I did not say thank you or anything (bc why would I?!) 

Today she left a review on our app, specifically describing me saying “the blabla woman is so slow and rude, all my friends agree that this cafe is very slow everytime I recommend them to go” LIKE GIRL BE SO SERIOUS RN 

If you think our cafe is soooo slow and bad then stop coming?? I genuinely don’t understand how people would be so comfortable treating service workers like shit but then expect us to take it with a smile!

And also, if you’re in a rush, maybe don’t stop for coffee?! These people who insist on being prioritised would also lose their minds if we decided to priotise someone else bc they are also in a rush. So why act like this? I am so annoyed 😭😭😭 I really love the coffee industry but rude customers is making it so hard to love and enjoy my job. So yeah that’s my rant. ",6,1767240919.0,barista,2,1.0,False

It’s 9:43 AM on Jan 1st and Bangalore is pretending to be calm. Roads are empty, air feels clean, and BMTC is still late, so some things are permanent.

I went out for a “morning walk” which was just me walking slowly and overthinking. Cubbon Park was full of people running like they’re chasing a new personality. I sat on a bench scrolling my phone, opened a dating app, saw the same profiles with “new year, new me” energy, and closed it like I’d seen enough character development for one day.

Came back, made coffee, drank it standing in the kitchen like an office pantry ritual. No hangover, no party stories, just the quiet realisation that the year changed but my routine woke up before me.

Anyway, it’s 9:43 AM. Whole year ahead. I’m already looking forward to lunch.",3,1767240904.0,BangaloreSocial,0,1.0,False

But it’s a journey: you’ll need to handle shipping, customs, quality control, and paperwork. Here’s the full, step-by-step breakdown, real numbers, and what to watch out for

---
Why Foshan? (And What Makes It the Furniture Capital)
Foshan, in Guangdong, is basically the Disneyland for furniture buyers. Over 3,000 factories, 7,000+ manufacturers, and the world’s largest furniture market (Lecong) are all packed into one city. You’ll find everything: home, office, outdoor, luxury, minimalist, and custom pieces. Factories here are set up for both massive orders and highly customized, one-off designs. Want a pink velvet sofa, a 3m marble dining table, or built-in wardrobes to your specs? They’ll make it happen. The “front shop, back factory” model means you can see, touch, and order right from the source, with your order going straight to the factory floor

The Real Cost Breakdown: Foshan vs. USA vs. Australia (No Tables, Just Numbers)
Let’s talk about what it actually costs to furnish a 3–4 bedroom house, side by side:
- USA Retail:
  - Bedroom sets: $1,500–$4,000 each
  - Living room: $4,000–$6,000 (sofa, coffee table, TV stand, etc.)
  - Dining: $1,500–$4,000
  - Mattresses: $800–$1,200 each
  - Office: $300–$2,000
  - Storage: $100–$2,000 per piece
  - Outdoor: $300–$1,500
  - Total for a full house: $10,000–$40,000 (most spend ~$16,000)
  - Delivery and assembly are extra
  - 
  - .
- Australia Retail:
  - Bedroom sets: $300–$2,000 (budget) up to $4,000+ (mid-range)
  - Living room: $4,000–$10,000
  - Dining: $200–$2,000
  - Mattresses: $199–$1,999
  - Office: $100–$800
  - Storage: $50–$800 per piece
  - Outdoor: $200–$2,000
  - Total for a full house: $10,000–$25,000 (mid-range), up to $30,000+ for designer
  - 
  - .
- Foshan Direct (Bulk Import):
  - Bedroom set: $600–$1,200
  - Living room: $1,000–$2,000
  - Dining: $400–$900
  - Mattress: $150–$400
  - Office: $100–$300
  - Storage: $200–$500
  - Outdoor: $300–$800
  - Full house (all-in, landed): $4,000–$8,000 (plus shipping, duties, and last-mile delivery, split among friends)
  - Shipping a 20ft container: $2,000–$5,000 to the USA, $1,200–$2,500 to Australia. 40ft container: $3,000–$8,000 (USA), $2,000–$3,800 (Australia). Insurance: $100–$200. Last-mile delivery: $300–$1,000 extra.
What does this mean in real life?
If you’re in the USA, furnishing a 3–4 bedroom house with mid-range retail is $12,000–$16,000. Foshan import (with friends, full container) is $5,000–$8,000 landed. In Australia, retail is $10,000–$25,000, while Foshan import is $6,000–$10,000 landed. That’s a $5,000–$15,000+ saving per house, especially if you split a container with friends.

Step-by-Step: How to Import Furniture for a Whole House (with Friends)
1. Planning & Sourcing
- List every room, measure your spaces, and decide on styles.
- Find factories via Alibaba, Made-in-China, or sourcing agents. Look for “Gold Supplier” status, export experience, and good reviews.
- Always order samples or visit Foshan (or hire an agent to do it for you).
- Combine orders with friends to fill a 20ft/40ft container for best rates.
2. Placing the Order
- Most factories require 10–100 pieces per item, but many will mix items for a full-house order.
- Confirm all specs, finishes, and sizes. Double-check measurements (Chinese “queen” ≠ US “queen”).
- Standard payment: 30% deposit, 70% before shipment. Use secure payment methods.
3. Shipping & Logistics
- FCL (Full Container Load): Best for whole house/group buys.
- LCL (Less than Container Load): For smaller orders, but higher per-item cost.
- Hire a reputable freight forwarder to handle consolidation, paperwork, and customs.
- Always insure your shipment.
4. Customs & Delivery
- Prepare documents: commercial invoice, packing list, bill of lading, fumigation certificate (for wood), etc.
- Pay duties/taxes, arrange for last-mile delivery.
- Most items are flat-packed. Prepare for some DIY or hire local help.

---
Shipping & Logistics: What You Need to Know
- 20ft container: 28–30 CBM, $2,000–$5,000 (USA), $1,200–$2,500 (Australia), 15–24 days transit.
- 40ft container: 55–60 CBM, $3,000–$8,000 (USA), $2,000–$3,800 (Australia), 16–28 days transit.
- LCL (shared): $65–$120/CBM, but more prone to delays.
- Last-mile delivery: $300–$1,000 extra, depending on location.
- Insurance: $100–$200 per container.
- Consolidation: Forwarders can combine multiple friends’ orders into one container.
Pro tip: Book shipments well in advance of peak seasons (Chinese New Year, Golden Week) to avoid delays and price spikes


.

---
Import Rules: USA vs. Australia
USA:
- Duties: 0–12.8% (most), plus 7.5–25% China tariff, and up to 216% anti-dumping on some wood bedroom furniture.
- Lacey Act: Must declare wood species and origin.
- TSCA: Composite wood must meet formaldehyde standards.
- Docs: Invoice, packing list, bill of lading, fumigation cert, CPSC/TSCA, Lacey Act declaration.
- Large shipments may be flagged as commercial.
- Inspections are random, especially for wood.
Australia:
- Duties: 0% with ChAFTA (if you have a Certificate of Origin), otherwise 3–5%.
- GST: 10% on landed value (cost + insurance + freight).
- Biosecurity: Strict on wood, bamboo, rattan—must have fumigation and/or phytosanitary certificates.
- BICON: Check for import permits and treatment requirements.
- Docs: Invoice, packing list, bill of lading, fumigation cert, phytosanitary cert, Certificate of Origin.
- Over AUD 1,000: full customs, GST, processing charge.
- Inspections are common for wood, bamboo, rattan.
Pro tip: Use a customs broker or DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) service for your first import. They’ll handle the paperwork and reduce headaches

Pros & Cons: Direct Import vs. Local Retail
Foshan Direct Import (Bulk):
- 30–75% cheaper (especially in bulk)
- High customization (size, color, material)
- Must manage your own quality control
- 4–8 weeks (production + shipping)
- Assembly required
- Limited warranty/returns
- Must ensure all docs/certs
- Higher risk (damage, delays, customs)
USA/AU Retail:
- Higher price, but instant
- Limited customization
- Consistent quality
- 1–14 days delivery
- Optional assembly (white-glove available)
- Strong warranty/returns
- Retailer handles compliance
- Low risk

Real-World Experiences & Lessons Learned

Case Study 1 (Australia):
“We spent $34,000 USD to furnish our entire home (cabinets, kitchen, furniture, hardware) from Foshan. Local quotes were $75,000. Everything arrived in one 40ft container. Quality was great, but we had to pay $3,000 in quarantine/treatment fees and wait 2 months for delivery.

”Case Study 2 (USA):

“Furnished a 4-bedroom house for $7,000 landed (including shipping, duties, last-mile). Local stores quoted $18,000 for similar quality. Used a sourcing agent, paid for third-party inspection, and split a 40ft container with two friends. Only issue: one sofa was the wrong color, but the factory sent a replacement cover.”Common challenges:

- Quality can be inconsistent—always order samples and pay for inspections.
- Shipping delays (especially around Chinese New Year).
- Assembly is more work than local retail.
- Customs paperwork is a pain if you DIY.
Biggest wins:
- Customization and variety.
- Massive savings (especially for group buys).
- Long-term durability (if you choose reputable factories).

---
Actionable Tips for First-Timers


- Use a sourcing agent: They’ll help with language, negotiation, and quality control.

- Pay for third-party inspection: Worth every penny.
- Consolidate with friends: Fill a container to maximize savings.
- Insure your shipment: Don’t risk it.
- Plan for delays: Add 2–4 weeks buffer.
- Check compliance: Especially for wood, fire safety, and labeling.
- Keep all paperwork: For customs and any disputes.

Final Thoughts
If you’re willing to put in the work, importing from Foshan (especially with friends) is the ultimate furniture hack for a full house setup. You’ll save thousands, get exactly what you want, and have a story to tell. But do your homework, expect some bumps, and don’t skip the quality checks. Happy importing!

---
Key Takeaway:
If you want the best price and don’t mind a little adventure, importing from Foshan is unbeatable. If you want convenience, warranty, and zero hassle, stick with local retail. For the bold, the savings and customization are absolutely worth it",1,1767240817.0,FoshanFurnitures,0,1.0,False

Pros & Cons: Direct Import vs. Local Retail

Foshan Direct Import (Bulk):

- 30–75% cheaper (especially in bulk)
- High customization (size, color, material)
- Must manage your own quality control
- 4–8 weeks (production + shipping)
- Assembly required
- Limited warranty/returns
- Must ensure all docs/certs
- Higher risk (damage, delays, customs)

USA/AU Retail:
- Higher price, but instant
- Limited customization
- Consistent quality
- 1–14 days delivery
- Optional assembly (white-glove available)
- Strong warranty/returns
- Retailer handles compliance
- Low risk

Real-World Experiences & Lessons Learned
Case Study 1 (Australia):

“We spent $34,000 USD to furnish our entire home (cabinets, kitchen, furniture, hardware) from Foshan. Local quotes were $75,000. Everything arrived in one 40ft container. Quality was great, but we had to pay $3,000 in quarantine/treatment fees and wait 2 months for delivery.”Case Study 2

 (USA):

“Furnished a 4-bedroom house for $7,000 landed (including shipping, duties, last-mile). Local stores quoted $18,000 for similar quality. Used a sourcing agent, paid for third-party inspection, and split a 40ft container with two friends. Only issue: one sofa was the wrong color, but the factory sent a replacement cover.”Common challenges:

- Quality can be inconsistent—always order samples and pay for inspections.
- Shipping delays (especially around Chinese New Year).
- Assembly is more work than local retail.
- Customs paperwork is a pain if you DIY.
Biggest wins:
- Customization and variety.
- Massive savings (especially for group buys).
- Long-term durability (if you choose reputable factories).

---
Actionable Tips for First-Timers
- Start small: Test with a few pieces or a shared LCL shipment before going all-in.
- Use a sourcing agent: They’ll help with language, negotiation, and quality control.
- Order samples: Never skip this step.
- Pay for third-party inspection: Worth every penny.
- Consolidate with friends: Fill a container to maximize savings.
- Insure your shipment: Don’t risk it.
- Plan for delays: Add 2–4 weeks buffer.
- Check compliance: Especially for wood, fire safety, and labeling.
- Keep all paperwork: For customs and any disputes.

Final Thoughts
If you’re willing to put in the work, importing from Foshan (especially with friends) is the ultimate furniture hack for a full house setup. You’ll save thousands, get exactly what you want, and have a story to tell. But do your homework, expect some bumps, and don’t skip the quality checks. Happy importing!

---
Key Takeaway:
If you want the best price and don’t mind a little adventure, importing from Foshan is unbeatable. If you want convenience, warranty, and zero hassle, stick with local retail. For the bold, the savings and customization are absolutely worth it",1,1767240692.0,china__furniture,0,1.0,False
1q0vcft,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1q0vcft/something_evil_is_seeping_into_fernsmouth/,Something Evil is Seeping into Fernsmouth,"I was surprised to see her back in the building. She had kept her head down in the pews, but now in the confession booth, her breaths came out in choked sobs. The sound sent goosebumps up my arms.

“Heather what is it?” I asked, my voice hushed even though it was only us left in the building. Hiccupping she took several breaths.

“Father, I am so sorry. I’ve done something terrible.” she shudders, the movement is jerky and awkward. 

“Tell me then Heather, you can trust me. Does Larry know anything about this?” Peering through the screen she nods.

“It was him that did it. I watched it happen, oh god Father. They’re watching everywhere, but not here for some reason.” I didn’t have any clue what she was talking about. This was the first I had heard of her husband in some time, the first I had seen her in some time.

""Where is your husband?” I asked. “I haven’t seen him in three months, I thought you had disappeared along with him.” I hadn’t laid eyes on Heather in well over a month. 

“They took him, and then they took me Father.” she inhales again, sitting up a little straighter. “That therapy group he joined, they’re beyond demented. The missing people, it's because of them.”

“Amity ? The therapy group?” I had lost some of my congregation to them, a self help group that offered alternatives my church could not. Friendly competition at most, a different path to peace. Heather jerked her head up and down.

“People who go there get sucked into their group, some get taken from their homes.” I shuddered at the mention of the missing family. They had left one depressed girl in their wake. I had been brought in to talk to her at the station. What the officers thought I could do, I was most unsure. The only response I had gotten from the girl had been a muttered thanks. I couldn't blame her. Who wanted some preacher in their ear after something like that?

“Heather, have you gone to the police about this? What sort of proof do you have?” She only started sobbing again. 

“It was Larry oh god, he was so confused.” she started hyperventilating at this point. Rushing out of the booth I swung open her door, and let her pile into my arms. 

“Breath, Heather please just breathe, you can tell me here, you know that.” She clung to me with hands of iron, skinny fingers digging into my arms with all the ferocity of a tiger. 

“Larry killed Dave Sanders, and we all just watched.” Her eyes shot wide open, looking into mine with a fear that made me pale.

“You watched?” I asked. I started to drag her to her feet. “We need to go to the station right now, and tell the officers!”

“No!” she screamed and pulled away from me, darting to the altar, curling around it like a scared cat. “Some of them were there. You’ll feed me to them. I need you to believe me Father Owen. I’ve been hiding like a rat for a week now, and all I know is that they won’t come here, they avoid the church no matter what.” She fell down to her knees, hands locked together. “Please, I beg you. Just listen to me Father. I don’t know what else to do.” Her hands ran through her hair. “God they’re getting bigger by the day.” Letting out a breath I indulged her. 

Her story was insane, and disjointed. Everything about it told me the woman’s mind had broken. Her story claimed that Amity Aims was a cult making people disappear. Everybody was in on it, members of the police force, some members of the town council. I did what I could to comfort the lady.

“Breathe Heather, is there anywhere I can take you?” I asked. She shook her head rapidly. She seemed adamant about the murder her husband had committed. 

“No please just hide me here for a while Father. There has to be someone you can talk to, please just help me.” I cupped my hands over hers.

“Easy now Heather, you can stay here. I’ll grab you some supplies, so you can hide for a time.” 

“Thank you, thank you, thank you.” she said bowing at my feet. I reassured her one more time, ignoring my pity for the woman. A terrible thing to do as a preacher, but her story was unhinged. The grief of her missing husband had driven her over the edge. Something becoming more common as the missing persons count grew higher.

The station wasn’t far from the church, and the interior was warm, the smell of black coffee wafting in the room. The lady behind looked tired, her blond hair done up in a tight bun. She smiled brightly as I walked towards the desk.

“Father Owen, how can I help you today?” She ran a finger over a silver ring. 

“Hello Leslie, this is a lot to dump on you, but Heather Strude just showed up at the church out of the blue.” Leslie raised an eyebrow. 

“Really? She’s been missing for awhile now, what did she say to you?” I relayed the story, watching her brows raise higher and higher as it went on. She leaned back when I finished furrowing her brow. “The chief will want to know about this. He’ll probably want to go with you. Wait here please Father.” I sat down in one of the uncomfortable chairs in the lobby and tapped my feet. I felt like a schoolboy waiting for the principal. 

The chief came into the lobby with another officer, Desmond, a local of the town. 

“Hello Father.” The chief was a kind man. Silver haired, with a well groomed mustache. “I hear you’ve found a missing person, for me.” I smiled.

“I wish I could take the credit sir, but she came to mass today. She needs help.” He nodded grimly.

“So I’ve heard, Desmond and I will follow you back to the church, and take her in. Good chance she’ll know where the other missing people are.” he motioned to the door. “After you Father.”



The door to the church creaked open, Heather was nowhere to be found. I turned back to Chief Greg. “There’s a good chance she’ll be down near the kitchen. There’s a spare bed down there.” I stopped again. “She’s also very on edge, I’ll go down first just to calm her.” The men nodded, as I pushed a door open into a small hallway. The kitchen was small, the stove light on, a bed not far from it just barely visible in the pale yellow light. “Heather?” I called warily. My footsteps creaked on the floor.

Hands grabbed me as I stepped further into the room, something sharp was against my throat.

“You got the police.” she hissed. She pressed the knife further into my skin.

“Of course Heather, please just let go of the knife. They’re here to help.”

“Did you see their hands?” Heather’s words jabbed into my ears, her breath hot.

“Heather please, what are you talking about?” I squirmed in her grip, only causing her to hold me tighter.

“You have to look at their hands they have a-” 

“Hands now!” The two officers had their guns pointed at Heather, eyes locked onto the woman. Using the distraction I pushed from her grasp, as Desmond rushed in and tackled her, ripping the knife from her hand. She screamed, flailing and crying as he cuffed her. 

She screamed all the way as they drug her out into the daylight towards the muddy police vehicle. The RCMP logo covered with a layer of brown filth.

“You killed me Father, you killed me!” she howled like a banshee, some onlookers watching with horrified expressions. The two men wrestled her into the car, slamming the door. Her cries were muffled. Greg let out a sigh.

“You alright Father?” he asked. My hands shook at my sides. I could feel a light scratch where the knife had dug into my throat. I took a deep breath clasping my neck.

“I will, thank you gentlemen. I’m just glad I was able to help. Have a blessed day.” Greg looked at me with skepticism in his eyes.

“You need anything else Owen you know where to find us, hell you know where to find me. You need a free meal or something, come on over.” I assured him once more. The drive back to my home passed in a daze. Only when I pulled into my driveway, did I wake up. Three dogs had knocked over my trash can and were digging through it. They were skinny and mangy, their unclean fur reached my nostrils as I stepped out. 

“Beat it!” I yelled at them. They froze heads snapping up. Their eyes were wide mouths agape with sharp yellow teeth. One snarled, and I leapt back a hand on my throat. What was I thinking? They could maul me if they wanted to. Instead they barked loudly before tearing off into the neighbourhood. Grumbling, I stuffed my garbage back and wearily stepped into my home.



The tv hummed away, I couldn’t even remember what I had thrown on. I felt restless, as Heather's words rang in my head. Guilt made my insides boil. Though I didn’t know why. Praying had offered little consolation. If the lord was listening, he offered no signs. I shut off the tv, the silence deafening. Every creak of the house seemed so much louder than it had before. My clock ticked and tocked, an unceasing marching beat. 

The sound was just audible enough that I had to stop several times, to make sure it was real. It was coming from my backyard. Slowly I crept towards my backdoor, the glass window fogged up from the night air. I tried in vain to look through it, but I could just barely make out the shapes in my backyard. The blurry forms of my garden beds, and a table I had left out were just visible. The sound was wet, occasionally a snap would accompany the sound of something being torn. Slipping on my shoes, I grew bold and opened the backdoor. 

Yellow light flooded the backyard, showing nothing. The sound stopped. From where I stood, I could see over the fence that hemmed in my yard. Three sets of glowing eyes peered back at me. The shapes were lithe just visible in the dark. They started growling. I leapt back looking at what must have been the three dogs from earlier, or coyotes. I had no idea of knowing. I opened my mouth to yell at them, when a fourth shape rose from the dark.

It moved slowly in a fluid motion, its eyes glowing in the dark.Then it moved forward. A long pale hand with sharp yellow nails, rested on the top of my fence. The fingers were covered in a dark red. Some tiny voice in my head told me it was blood. The light shone on the torso of the figure, revealing the ends of snow white hair, and a long slender neck. The jaw of the figure was matted in blood. The dogs began barking, yapping in a loud frenzy. The figure raised another blood covered hand in a wave. The lips began moving a hissing sound coming from them. Like they were trying to talk. 

I didn’t wait to listen. I slammed the door shut, watching as the figure leapt over the fence and started walking straight towards the backdoor. I screamed and burst out of my front door, into the cold night. Something slammed behind me, glass broke. My keys were still in the house, so I sprinted down the sidewalk, screaming the entire way. I could hear the figure behind me, footsteps getting closer, the dogs growling and yapping. 

The red house was near the corner of the street, and I leapt up the stairs and banged on the door with all my might. It swung open revealing a disheveled Chief Greg in a bathrobe, with his gun in hand.

“Owen what the hell?” he shouted. “Look out!” The growling dogs behind me stood at the steps snapping maws covered in blood. “Get out of here you mutts, get out!” he bellowed. The dogs sprinted into the dark. “What’s going on?” Owen turned to me.

“There was someone outside my house! They were with those dogs.” I whirled behind me scanning the darkness for any movement. The figure had vanished. It didn’t take long for police to surround my house, the blue and red lights dancing in the night sky. 

Greg stood with two other officers behind the fence. They had scanned the house, the only sign of an intruder was my backdoor that had been kicked open. The figure hadn’t left any other signs of entry. No footprints, or anything. The only thing they had found was a dead deer. The body mangled and torn into the stomach nothing but a hollow cave of rib bone and flesh.

“We’ll get this cleaned up for you Father. Are you sure you saw somebody?” he peered into my eyes. 

“Yes Greg, I’ll never forget what she looked like.” I sat down, hands on my knees. I would never get to sleep tonight. Greg set a hand on my shoulder.

“Alright then, we’ll keep an eye on your house for a few times Owen, best I can do.” He waved a hand around the house. “We’ll even set you up with some security alarms to help you feel safe again. Just try to sleep tonight.” He gave me one last concerned look before leaving. I stayed awake the entire night.



Even though I knew it was a mistake, I left my house. Some men came by early to install my security alarms. One of them had a silver ring on. Heather’s warning echoed in my mind. The hands. People in the grocery store were wearing them. Seemingly only a few at first, but the number grew. I counted five at least. The cashier waved at me and told me to have a good day. Her ring glinting in the sun. Three more people wore them. I drove straight back to my house, she had been right the entire time.

The alarms were installed on my house, a guide was tucked underneath my welcome mat. They were easy to turn on, seemingly normal. I knew better than to trust these. Both of those men might have also had rings as well. Did this mean some sort of group had invaded Fernsmouth? What was their goal? I closed my blinds and rooted through my house like a rat. I found two cameras. Small bug eyed things, one on my tv sensor, and one concealed behind some books in my room. 

They had already invaded my home. Time passed in a slow crawl, as I jolted at every sound. I didn’t even know if I could trust my neighbours. Lord I had turned Heather right over into their hands. She was as good as dead for all I knew. The police force was compromised to an extent. If only I had looked at their hands, the only one so far was Leslie. But what about Greg himself, or Desmond, or the other officer that had shown up last night? The sun sank beneath the horizon and the shadows crept back in. 

I looked through my window blinds and saw a police car parked out front. I only hoped I could trust them. How easy would it be for them to walk in and shoot me? 

I didn’t aim to find out, and tried to keep myself up through the night again. Slowly yet surely the exhaustion began to take me.

The creaking awoke me first. His massive frame filled my view, the only thing visible in the dark. 

“Father,” he said. 

“Larry?” I mumbled. The punch knocked me onto the floor, something in my face cracked. The taste of iron filled my mouth, as a tooth fell out of my mouth. I tried to drag myself across the floor, but a large hand grabbed me by the back of my neck, and threw me into my kitchen. 

“This is my next step, Father, so I get better. My mistress will watch.” The words make no sense, I don’t have time to process them. This man is a killer. Before I can get back up, a foot slams into my chest, and I feel a rib crack. Wheezing I swipe at the man, but my hits do nothing. His massive hands wrap around my throat. He lifts me like a doll, and spots and stars dance in my vision as the breath leaves my chest. “Witness mistress, witness please.”

The man lifts me above the kitchen sink, and my eyes lock onto the pale figure again. The woman smiles with glee as the moonlight shows her manic expression as the life is squeezed from me. My hand fumbles in the dark, as everything dims, latching onto the handle of the knife, I bring it up in an arc. The blade plunges into Larry’s shoulder, and he bellows like a beast from Hell. He stumbles back into the counter smashing his head into a cupboard. 

Scrambling I bolt for the door, slamming into my kitchen table, and spiraling into my couch. The brute recovers quickly, grabbing me by my right arm. He forces me to the ground, and before I can register what he’s doing, a massive weight slams down onto my elbow. Bone cracks and pain explodes in my arm. I know I screamed, but somehow the pain drowns it out. The only thing I can hear is a dull ringing in my ears. Larry roars again, lunging down at me.

The front door bursts open. I watch Larry look up in confusion at the light from outside, displaying a feral looking man, his shoulder a deep dark red. The next moment his fleshy throat explodes into pulp, his left eye explodes, as a part of his skull goes with it. Greg rushes over me, his words ringing as he tries to say something to me, but oblivion takes me.



My arm is shattered making it rather difficult to type all of this. Larry almost killed me, a man I considered a friend. I’m grateful Greg was there to save me. I’m in the hospital right now, some of the staff are wearing silver rings. I can’t be here for much longer. Something evil has seeped into my town, and I need to find out what.

I opened my mouth to yell at them, when a fourth shape rose from the dark.

It moved slowly in a fluid motion, its eyes glowing in the dark.Then it moved forward. A long pale hand with sharp yellow nails, rested on the top of my fence. The fingers were covered in a dark red. Some tiny voice in my head told me it was blood. The light shone on the torso of the figure, revealing the ends of snow white hair, and a long slender neck. The jaw of the figure was matted in blood. The dogs began barking, yapping in a loud frenzy. The figure raised another blood covered hand in a wave. The lips began moving a hissing sound coming from them. Like they were trying to talk. 

I didn’t wait to listen. I slammed the door shut, watching as the figure leapt over the fence and started walking straight towards the backdoor. I screamed and burst out of my front door, into the cold night. Something slammed behind me, glass broke. My keys were still in the house, so I sprinted down the sidewalk, screaming the entire way. I could hear the figure behind me, footsteps getting closer, the dogs growling and yapping. 

The red house was near the corner of the street, and I leapt up the stairs and banged on the door with all my might. It swung open revealing a disheveled Chief Greg in a bathrobe, with his gun in hand.

“Owen what the hell?” he shouted. “Look out!” The growling dogs behind me stood at the steps snapping maws covered in blood. “Get out of here you mutts, get out!” he bellowed. The dogs sprinted into the dark. “What’s going on?” Owen turned to me.

“There was someone outside my house! They were with those dogs.” I whirled behind me scanning the darkness for any movement. The figure had vanished. It didn’t take long for police to surround my house, the blue and red lights dancing in the night sky. 

Greg stood with two other officers behind the fence. They had scanned the house, the only sign of an intruder was my backdoor that had been kicked open. The figure hadn’t left any other signs of entry. No footprints, or anything. The only thing they had found was a dead deer. The body mangled and torn into the stomach nothing but a hollow cave of rib bone and flesh.

“We’ll get this cleaned up for you Father. Are you sure you saw somebody?” he peered into my eyes. 

“Yes Greg, I’ll never forget what she looked like.” I sat down, hands on my knees. I would never get to sleep tonight. Greg set a hand on my shoulder.

“Alright then, we’ll keep an eye on your house for a few times Owen, best I can do.” He waved a hand around the house. “We’ll even set you up with some security alarms to help you feel safe again. Just try to sleep tonight.” He gave me one last concerned look before leaving. I stayed awake the entire night.



Even though I knew it was a mistake, I left my house. Some men came by early to install my security alarms. One of them had a silver ring on. Heather’s warning echoed in my mind. The hands. People in the grocery store were wearing them. Seemingly only a few at first, but the number grew. I counted five at least. The cashier waved at me and told me to have a good day. Her ring glinting in the sun. Three more people wore them. I drove straight back to my house, she had been right the entire time.

The alarms were installed on my house, a guide was tucked underneath my welcome mat. They were easy to turn on, seemingly normal. I knew better than to trust these. Both of those men might have also had rings as well. Did this mean some sort of group had invaded Fernsmouth? What was their goal? I closed my blinds and rooted through my house like a rat. I found two cameras. Small bug eyed things, one on my tv sensor, and one concealed behind some books in my room. 

They had already invaded my home. Time passed in a slow crawl, as I jolted at every sound. I didn’t even know if I could trust my neighbours. Lord I had turned Heather right over into their hands. She was as good as dead for all I knew. The police force was compromised to an extent. If only I had looked at their hands, the only one so far was Leslie. But what about Greg himself, or Desmond, or the other officer that had shown up last night? The sun sank beneath the horizon and the shadows crept back in. 

I looked through my window blinds and saw a police car parked out front. I only hoped I could trust them. How easy would it be for them to walk in and shoot me? 

I didn’t aim to find out, and tried to keep myself up through the night again. Slowly yet surely the exhaustion began to take me.

The creaking awoke me first. His massive frame filled my view, the only thing visible in the dark. 

“Father,” he said. 

“Larry?” I mumbled. The punch knocked me onto the floor, something in my face cracked. The taste of iron filled my mouth, as a tooth fell out of my mouth. I tried to drag myself across the floor, but a large hand grabbed me by the back of my neck, and threw me into my kitchen. 

“This is my next step, Father, so I get better. My mistress will watch.” The words make no sense, I don’t have time to process them. This man is a killer. Before I can get back up, a foot slams into my chest, and I feel a rib crack. Wheezing I swipe at the man, but my hits do nothing. His massive hands wrap around my throat. He lifts me like a doll, and spots and stars dance in my vision as the breath leaves my chest. “Witness mistress, witness please.”

The man lifts me above the kitchen sink, and my eyes lock onto the pale figure again. The woman smiles with glee as the moonlight shows her manic expression as the life is squeezed from me. My hand fumbles in the dark, as everything dims, latching onto the handle of the knife, I bring it up in an arc. The blade plunges into Larry’s shoulder, and he bellows like a beast from Hell. He stumbles back into the counter smashing his head into a cupboard. 

Scrambling I bolt for the door, slamming into my kitchen table, and spiraling into my couch. The brute recovers quickly, grabbing me by my right arm. He forces me to the ground, and before I can register what he’s doing, a massive weight slams down onto my elbow. Bone cracks and pain explodes in my arm. I know I screamed, but somehow the pain drowns it out. The only thing I can hear is a dull ringing in my ears. Larry roars again, lunging down at me.

The front door bursts open. I watch Larry look up in confusion at the light from outside, displaying a feral looking man, his shoulder a deep dark red. The next moment his fleshy throat explodes into pulp, his left eye explodes, as a part of his skull goes with it. Greg rushes over me, his words ringing as he tries to say something to me, but oblivion takes me.



My arm is shattered making it rather difficult to type all of this. Larry almost killed me, a man I considered a friend. I’m grateful Greg was there to save me. I’m in the hospital right now, some of the staff are wearing silver rings. I can’t be here for much longer. Something evil has seeped into my town, and I need to find out what.

She had kept her head down in the pews, but now in the confession booth, her breaths came out in choked sobs. The sound sent goosebumps up my arms.

“Heather what is it?” I asked, my voice hushed even though it was only us left in the building. Hiccupping she took several breaths.

“Father, I am so sorry. I’ve done something terrible.” she shudders, the movement is jerky and awkward. 

“Tell me then Heather, you can trust me. Does Larry know anything about this?” Peering through the screen she nods.

“It was him that did it. I watched it happen, oh god Father. They’re watching everywhere, but not here for some reason.” I didn’t have any clue what she was talking about. This was the first I had heard of her husband in some time, the first I had seen her in some time.

""Where is your husband?” I asked. “I haven’t seen him in three months, I thought you had disappeared along with him.” I hadn’t laid eyes on Heather in well over a month. 

“They took him, and then they took me Father.” she inhales again, sitting up a little straighter. “That therapy group he joined, they’re beyond demented. The missing people, it's because of them.”

“Amity ? The therapy group?” I had lost some of my congregation to them, a self help group that offered alternatives my church could not. Friendly competition at most, a different path to peace. Heather jerked her head up and down.

“People who go there get sucked into their group, some get taken from their homes.” I shuddered at the mention of the missing family. They had left one depressed girl in their wake. I had been brought in to talk to her at the station. What the officers thought I could do, I was most unsure. The only response I had gotten from the girl had been a muttered thanks. I couldn't blame her. Who wanted some preacher in their ear after something like that?

“Heather, have you gone to the police about this? What sort of proof do you have?” She only started sobbing again. 

“It was Larry oh god, he was so confused.” she started hyperventilating at this point. Rushing out of the booth I swung open her door, and let her pile into my arms. 

“Breath, Heather please just breathe, you can tell me here, you know that.” She clung to me with hands of iron, skinny fingers digging into my arms with all the ferocity of a tiger. 

“Larry killed Dave Sanders, and we all just watched.” Her eyes shot wide open, looking into mine with a fear that made me pale.

“You watched?” I asked. I started to drag her to her feet. “We need to go to the station right now, and tell the officers!”

“No!” she screamed and pulled away from me, darting to the altar, curling around it like a scared cat. “Some of them were there. You’ll feed me to them. I need you to believe me Father Owen. I’ve been hiding like a rat for a week now, and all I know is that they won’t come here, they avoid the church no matter what.” She fell down to her knees, hands locked together. “Please, I beg you. Just listen to me Father. I don’t know what else to do.” Her hands ran through her hair. “God they’re getting bigger by the day.” Letting out a breath I indulged her. 

Her story was insane, and disjointed. Everything about it told me the woman’s mind had broken. Her story claimed that Amity Aims was a cult making people disappear. Everybody was in on it, members of the police force, some members of the town council. I did what I could to comfort the lady.

“Breathe Heather, is there anywhere I can take you?” I asked. She shook her head rapidly. She seemed adamant about the murder her husband had committed. 

“No please just hide me here for a while Father. There has to be someone you can talk to, please just help me.” I cupped my hands over hers.

“Easy now Heather, you can stay here. I’ll grab you some supplies, so you can hide for a time.” 

“Thank you, thank you, thank you.” she said bowing at my feet. I reassured her one more time, ignoring my pity for the woman. A terrible thing to do as a preacher, but her story was unhinged. The grief of her missing husband had driven her over the edge. Something becoming more common as the missing persons count grew higher.

The station wasn’t far from the church, and the interior was warm, the smell of black coffee wafting in the room. The lady behind looked tired, her blond hair done up in a tight bun. She smiled brightly as I walked towards the desk.

“Father Owen, how can I help you today?” She ran a finger over a silver ring. 

“Hello Leslie, this is a lot to dump on you, but Heather Strude just showed up at the church out of the blue.” Leslie raised an eyebrow. 

“Really? She’s been missing for awhile now, what did she say to you?” I relayed the story, watching her brows raise higher and higher as it went on. She leaned back when I finished furrowing her brow. “The chief will want to know about this. He’ll probably want to go with you. Wait here please Father.” I sat down in one of the uncomfortable chairs in the lobby and tapped my feet. I felt like a schoolboy waiting for the principal. 

The chief came into the lobby with another officer, Desmond, a local of the town. 

“Hello Father.” The chief was a kind man. Silver haired, with a well groomed mustache. “I hear you’ve found a missing person, for me.” I smiled.

“I wish I could take the credit sir, but she came to mass today. She needs help.” He nodded grimly.

“So I’ve heard, Desmond and I will follow you back to the church, and take her in. Good chance she’ll know where the other missing people are.” he motioned to the door. “After you Father.”



The door to the church creaked open, Heather was nowhere to be found. I turned back to Chief Greg. “There’s a good chance she’ll be down near the kitchen. There’s a spare bed down there.” I stopped again. “She’s also very on edge, I’ll go down first just to calm her.” The men nodded, as I pushed a door open into a small hallway. The kitchen was small, the stove light on, a bed not far from it just barely visible in the pale yellow light. “Heather?” I called warily. My footsteps creaked on the floor.

Hands grabbed me as I stepped further into the room, something sharp was against my throat.

“You got the police.” she hissed. She pressed the knife further into my skin.

“Of course Heather, please just let go of the knife. They’re here to help.”

“Did you see their hands?” Heather’s words jabbed into my ears, her breath hot.

“Heather please, what are you talking about?” I squirmed in her grip, only causing her to hold me tighter.

“You have to look at their hands they have a-” 

“Hands now!” The two officers had their guns pointed at Heather, eyes locked onto the woman. Using the distraction I pushed from her grasp, as Desmond rushed in and tackled her, ripping the knife from her hand. She screamed, flailing and crying as he cuffed her. 

She screamed all the way as they drug her out into the daylight towards the muddy police vehicle. The RCMP logo covered with a layer of brown filth.

“You killed me Father, you killed me!” she howled like a banshee, some onlookers watching with horrified expressions. The two men wrestled her into the car, slamming the door. Her cries were muffled. Greg let out a sigh.

“You alright Father?” he asked. My hands shook at my sides. I could feel a light scratch where the knife had dug into my throat. I took a deep breath clasping my neck.

“I will, thank you gentlemen. I’m just glad I was able to help. Have a blessed day.” Greg looked at me with skepticism in his eyes.

“You need anything else Owen you know where to find us, hell you know where to find me. You need a free meal or something, come on over.” I assured him once more. The drive back to my home passed in a daze. Only when I pulled into my driveway, did I wake up. Three dogs had knocked over my trash can and were digging through it. They were skinny and mangy, their unclean fur reached my nostrils as I stepped out. 

“Beat it!” I yelled at them. They froze heads snapping up. Their eyes were wide mouths agape with sharp yellow teeth. One snarled, and I leapt back a hand on my throat. What was I thinking? They could maul me if they wanted to. Instead they barked loudly before tearing off into the neighbourhood. Grumbling, I stuffed my garbage back and wearily stepped into my home.



The tv hummed away, I couldn’t even remember what I had thrown on. I felt restless, as Heather's words rang in my head. Guilt made my insides boil. Though I didn’t know why. Praying had offered little consolation. If the lord was listening, he offered no signs. I shut off the tv, the silence deafening. Every creak of the house seemed so much louder than it had before. My clock ticked and tocked, an unceasing marching beat. 

The sound was just audible enough that I had to stop several times, to make sure it was real. It was coming from my backyard. Slowly I crept towards my backdoor, the glass window fogged up from the night air. I tried in vain to look through it, but I could just barely make out the shapes in my backyard. The blurry forms of my garden beds, and a table I had left out were just visible. The sound was wet, occasionally a snap would accompany the sound of something being torn. Slipping on my shoes, I grew bold and opened the backdoor. 

Yellow light flooded the backyard, showing nothing. The sound stopped. From where I stood, I could see over the fence that hemmed in my yard. Three sets of glowing eyes peered back at me. The shapes were lithe just visible in the dark. They started growling. I leapt back looking at what must have been the three dogs from earlier, or coyotes. I had no idea of knowing. I opened my mouth to yell at them, when a fourth shape rose from the dark.

I’m a 24-year-old Bangalore tech guy who has done everything right in life except… accidentally finding someone to date.

I live a very peaceful life:  
office → home → café → walk → overthinking like I’m preparing for UPSC → sleep.

I don’t drink, don’t club, vegetarian, and loud pubs make me stare into the distance like an old uncle who’s “bas thak gaya”. If your idea of fun is quiet cafés, long conversations, laughing at nonsense, and judging overpriced menus — we already have chemistry and haven’t even spoken yet.

Dating apps? Wow. Incredible experience.  
You match.  
You chat.  
You laugh.  
Then suddenly they disappear like a government website after 5pm.  
At this point I feel apps are just teaching patience.

So I thought — why not try Reddit, where people are funny, honest, and emotionally self-aware (sometimes).

I’m actually looking to **date**.  
Not drama. Not confusion. Not “let’s see where it goes” while it goes nowhere.  
Just talking, laughing, meeting, and seeing if something clicks. Simple. Like filter coffee.

What I bring to the table:  
– Calm energy  
– Dry, accidental humour  
– Listens properly  
– Will walk with you without checking phone  
– Emotionally available, not emotionally exhausting

If you’re a girl reading this and laughing more than you expected —  
hi.  
This post has done its job.

No pressure. No expectations.  
If you feel like talking, you can message.  
Worst case: one fun conversation.  
Best case: coffee, walks, and a very funny “how we met on Reddit” story.

Bangalore is huge, but all the calm people seem to be hiding at home.

I remember when Tim Hortons coffee was the standard by which all other coffee was measured. Now it's the worst on the market. They used to put care into every order, and treat their customers like family. Now their standards have gone down the toilet, and they screw up nearly every order. 

It's so sad to see what's become of an establishment that used to be a Canadian treasure. At the end of last year, I finally decided it was enough and I wasn't going to give them any more of my money.

Today marks one year Tim's-free, and I don't miss it at all! Cutting out Tim Hortons has been the best New Year's resolution I have ever made, and I encourage you all to do the same for 2026!

They like to see who is giving them orders. May opens a window, which seems to take quite a bit of effort and creative language. 

  


“Stupid fucks painted over it. Jesus, at least they didn’t nail them or some shit. Who the fuck has windows that don’t open, how stupid is that?” May grumbles as she waves the drones out. 



She slams the window and points dramatically, the lights start to flash in time with the music. The display inside the gilded frame rotates and expands, the dimensions of the room shift to give it space. A line of smaller paintings, smaller but with the same theme of animals in ugly hats, grow from the wall between the top of the frame and the ceiling. The screen divides, a snowy landscape rolling by below, gray sky above, snowflakes streaming at them like stars on a fast moving ship. They make a circle of the house and yard, the sparrows have mostly dispersed with a few dozen still pecking and peeping around. The drones head out in different directions, some moving faster than others. 

  


Out in the open, it’s very relaxing to watch the snow, but that’s pretty much all they can see. One makes several circles of JJ’s house and barn, a number of the sparrows have found the bird feeder on the porch and are getting a snack. The downtown area, which always has a great deal of decorative lighting, looks very much like the opening scene from some family friendly Christmas movie. There are a few folks out and about despite the weather, most of them Rycacian and all of them bundled up against the cold. Most of the open area here is either farms, residences, or industrial/utilities facilities, behind a wall of what looks like heavy static. 

  


Some of the drones have entered the woods, there’s snow on the ground and trees but less of it is getting through. It looks like the wooded area is shaped like a crescent, thicker at the middle and tapering off at the ends. On the left, if you were standing facing the front of the house, the trees thin and give way to a disused pasture. On the right, flora blocks out too much of the light for these trees to grow, and the forest quickly changes from photosynthesizing plants to flora. The middle section is mostly evergreens, which are blocking most of the snow fairly effectively. There are hardwoods here as well, the sudden drop in temperature has left them temporarily in possession of their greenery, though some of the more delicate species are already starting to drop leaves. The drone that had gone to the left weaves back into the trees and assists with exploration of the thicker section.



May waves her hand and the two videos take up the entire screen, the music mutes, the smaller pictures above it are now showing the feed from the rest of them. Everyone finds themselves breathing quietly and standing very still, even May, the only sounds are the soft tick of falling snow and the occasional chirping of birds. Something moves on the screen to the right and the drone focuses, flies over to look. A fairly small animal, orange and dark gray, with pointed ears and a bushy tail, gliding across the snow like a ghost.



“Vulpes Vulpes.” May says softly.



“It’s a fox!” Diesel says.



“Yep.” May says.



The fox spots the drone, turns around and looks at it with bright golden eyes. The animal opens it’s mouth and screams like a woman. Rahal yelps, Walker winces then rolls his eyes, Benni makes a surprised face, Diesel laughs, the rest don’t react to the sound.



“Yeah, yeah, bloody murder.” May says.



“Are they supposed to sound like that?” Rahal asks.



“Yes.” May rolls her eyes. “They’ll give you a fuckin heart attack out in the woods at night.”



The drone, also surprised by the sound, has backed off and the fox glides off and vanishes under a pile of large rocks.



“I’m sorry, that’s a real fox?” Benni says.



“Far as I know.” May says. “Been skulkin’ around there for years. You gotta watch Little Mama, she’ll come in through the dog door, steal your coffee. Look over and she’s there lappin out of the cup actin offended you ain’t got no biscuits.”



“On Rycacia?” Benni asks.



“No.” May says. “Foxes don’t live on Rycacia, you don’t have enough rodents.”



“But that’s where we are.” Benni says.



“Are we?” May asks. “That doesn’t look like Rycacia to me. That looks like somewhere...hm...well, those foxes are all over the place, including colony planets. Maybe we can hazard a guess if we look at some of these trees. Anybody know anything about botany?” May looks at JJ, who groans. “What’s that?”



“A larch.” JJ says.



“And that one?” May points to a very different tree.



“A larch.” JJ says again.



Walker snorts, May rolls her eyes and starts speaking again. “Fine, then, don’t play, I don’t care.” She stamps a foot and the music gears up once again. “What do we have here? Squirrels. Lots and lots of squirrels, look at this mix. Got some nut trees I think...Ok, that’s definitely a pee-can, so is that one over there...I think that’s a buckeye, that one’s a walnut, you see how it’s killed everything back around it there? Got a couple magnolias, nice live oak...couple different kinds of oak, looks like.” May crosses her arms and looks at JJ again. “This your neck of the woods?”



JJ rolls her eyes. “You see any cypress around here, honey?”



“Walker?” May asks.



“Somewhere in the Southeast US.” Walker says. “Georgia or Carolina, I think. Do we really need this music?”



“Yes! And very good.” May says. “The area of effect doesn’t end at the walls of the house, the border is where the flora starts back here, and the road up front. That’s why we’ve got the plants and animals.”



“So…” Rahal says. “We’re in HDC but we’re actually somewhere else.”



“Yep.” May says. “This is the full interior of the gate array. They can be generated in here, like I did for JJ, or they can go on the exterior, around the border. If I extend it out across the road, we can gate it and you can just drive through to or from wherever. I’m not gonna do that, but there is a gate at the driveway right now that connects to HDC and that’s just gonna carry all the way around until it gets blocked or gated again. If you walk off the property that’s here, you’ll be in HDC, it’s not gonna send you somewhere weird. Shouldn’t anyway. I’d be careful, though, if that little chickenshit starts fucking around it might set something off.”



“What happened to what was here before?” Rahal asks.



“Nothing happened to it.” May says. “It’s, like, folded up under us. If you’re following the surface exactly, you’ll just go down and back up and out again. We’re like a button sitting up there, you have to step up to get on it, or if you really wanna follow that metaphor, you have to follow the thread that attaches the button to the cloth and go through the button hole, which is the gate.”



“Can people wander in by accident, then?” Rahal asks.



“Sure, it doesn’t happen very often though. When you’ve got something like this, where it’s just basically running a constant gate in a circuit, you tend to get some environmental effects that lots of living things just want to avoid by instinct. As long as it’s not too big or difficult, they’ll usually go around. And yes, before you ask, there is a security system. It’s intelligent enough to be able to figure out what is a threat and what just needs to be gently guided out the other side.” May says.



“There are no ghosts on Rycacia.” JJ says.



“That’s what they say.” May says.



“ISTC is not happy you scared off those cops.” JJ says.



“I wasn’t here.” May says. “I didn’t scare nobody.”



“Well, they saw a ghost. A very terrifying one, according to what little they were willing to divulge.” JJ says.



May shrugs. “Dunno about that, sorry. I’m pretty sure the folks you’re after aren’t ghosts, though.”



“But, this house *is* haunted.” JJ says.



“It’s in the South.” May says. “If a house here isn’t haunted, well, what the fuck’s wrong with it? Ooh, there we go, bring that guy up.”



May snaps and points to one of the smaller displays, the feed comes up on the large screen. One of the drones is approaching a stone wall covered in snow. It passes through a cast iron gate and begins to move around snow covered grounds dotted with old stone buildings. Most of the buildings are tall and rectangular, the one directly in front of the gate when you come in has some decorative architecture, and there do seem to be quite a few windows, but they’re all covered in heavy bars or mesh. The drone tries to get an areal shot but the snow obscures the view too much and it drops down again.



The main building is an open rectangle with a courtyard in the center. Behind it, the buildings look like very depressing apartments in a bad area of town. Some of them have started to cave in, a few of the smaller buildings have more or less collapsed. Another large building with smoke stacks on the back, behind it another building with a very large smoke stack. There is what looks like a chapel, and a clock tower with the face frozen at six thirty as if the hands have given up the fight against gravity.



The drone completes it’s tour of the outside and heads into the closest building. It’s dark, dirty, snow is sifting down through holes in the roof and the floor is covered in patches of ice. Everyone has fallen silent and is watching as the footage approaches an open door off of the hall and turns to explore it. It’s almost bare, just a simple metal bed frame and thin mattress. The other rooms on the hall seem to be more or less the same, some of them have windows with bars on them, some of them have a chair or old blanket.



The drone exits the building and goes into the big one with the smoke stacks. This one has more stuff in it, there are wheelchairs and medical equipment scattered around the halls, some of the rooms are offices with desks that have paperwork still sitting on them. There are some exam rooms with primitive medical equipment, an operating theater, facilities that look like they must be for some sort of physical therapy. The drone follows a set of stairs down and finds the morgue, absent of any dead bodies.



“It’s an old hospital, right?” Diesel asks.



“It’s a sanatorium.” Dusty says.



“The Fern Hill Home for the Feeble Minded and Incurably Insane.” May says. “Sounds like Kelsey and Penny to me.”



“This doesn’t look abnormal.” Walker says. “Beyond what I’d expect for the time.”



“Yeah...that drone doesn’t like the clock tower there, does it.” May raises her voice. “Can we get another set of eyes out there, please?”



The screens above the display begin flipping rapid fire through feeds, then the large screen cuts to a different angle and from outside the grounds. It swoops along through the snow, lands on the top of the clock tower, circles it until it finds a gap and flies in. The gears inside are still, frozen in place. The footage hops around, looking at various details. There’s a wooden floor with an opening that leads down a wooden ladder to a room that seems to have been used to store mattresses and bedding.



The footage swoops down and lands on the edge of a mattress, begins hopping around exploring the area. They can see it’s able to lift and move the fabric out of the way, after a few minutes it finds something between folds of fabric and grabs it, pulls away and flies back up, through the guts of the clock and out into the open air.



The footage switches back to aesthetic views of Hangdog under the falling snow. After a few minutes, something taps on the window.



“Can someone open that, please?” May is staring at the display with her eyes narrowed.



Mac twists around on the couch and opens the window. It’s a bird, a black and gray one, a little over a foot long. The bird is holding something in it’s beak, a key on a short piece of ribbon. It blinks it’s little silver eyes at Mac, hops onto the back of the couch, then flies over and lands on May’s shoulder. She holds out her hand and the bird drops the key into it.



“The Jackdaw. Oh, I see how it is.” JJ says.



“You should, he’s not subtle.” May says.



“And he couldn’t just catch them while they were in here?” JJ crosses her arms and glares at May.



“He’s dead, what’s he supposed to do?” May says, the bird on her shoulder squawks in agreement.



“Apparently, he can do plenty.” JJ says.



“Why don’t you pull out your crystal ball and ask him?” May asks tauntingly. “Summon some spirits? Hm? Here, ghost ghost ghost! Suuuu-eeeee!”



JJ groans. “You know, this could be serious.”



“I need to call the Ghostbusters?” May asks.



“Penny and Kelsey!” JJ snaps.



“That is a serious matter.” May says. “I have some paperwork to serve them.”



JJ groans, May is giving her one of those obnoxiously amused looks. The problem with May being amused is that it often indicates she’s forcing the folks around her to engage in what she refers to as “enrichment activities”. This effectively means that she makes it difficult, but not impossible, for them to do their jobs.



It’s going to be even worse now that she has Rahal with her. The girl isn’t a witch, but she’s definitely a magic user, you can practically see it boiling away inside of her. JJ is pretty sure Rahal isn’t her assistant, or trainee, she’s her partner. She’s ditched the ISTC uniform and failed to acknowledge Walker even though she must be aware he’s her superior. She’s here to help May do whatever it is that May has decided to do, which generally includes but is not limited to what she’s been hired to accomplish.



JJ motions to Walker, who’s been hunched over a large book of photographs with Rick. He follows her into the kitchen, she fills the kettle and puts it on the stove then turns to look at him, leaning back against the counter. Walker shakes his head, sighs.



“Well, we now know who those jackdaws come from.” JJ says.



“Somehow, that doesn’t set my mind at ease.” Walker says. “Do you buy that shit about not being on Rycacia?”



“I mean, we probably technically aren’t.” JJ says. “But I feel like if that were actually true, those birds would be useless, he’s got to be riding them.”



\---



It’s late, JJ and Walker left hours ago, everyone except Dusty is upstairs and probably asleep. Dusty had been up there, too, until around half an hour ago. He’d woken up to something fluttering against the door, one of the Jackdaws had gotten trapped in the room with them and wanted out. It had flown out into the hall, landed, looked at him pointedly, then moved to the banister and repeated the process until Dusty followed it downstairs. It had flown into the living room and vanished, Dusty sat down on the couch across from the fireplace and stared at the flames, trying to decide if they were actually combusting something or just an illusion with a heating element hidden inside.



There is the distinct sound of someone shifting their weight on the wooden floor. Dusty looks up, there’s a man standing in the doorway, watching him. He looks real, human, but there’s something off about the way the light interacts with him that has stripped away his density. Dusty is reminded of the “idiot’s lantern” May had showed him one day, a simple device that projected an image onto fog. It had been the originator of the hologram technology the humans had initially developed, the mist based systems are still common, they just have much finer control over the area being sprayed.



This isn’t a hologram, though. Dusty knows what this is, and he knows who it is. This is a ghost, a real one.



“Doctor Livingston, I presume.” Dusty stands up.



Jack looks him up and down. “I see what all the fuss is about.”



Dusty realizes he’d been tensed up when he relaxes. Jack laughs. “I have no intent of haunting you or some rubbish. I’d actually like to ask a favor.”



“Oh, um…” Dusty hesitates.



“Can you please deck my brother Adrian when you catch him? Just once, right in his stupid face.” Jack crosses his arms, looking abruptly irritated. “I’d do it myself, but I seem to be somewhat lacking in the fist department at the moment.”



Dusty blinks at him, then bursts into laughter. Jack chuckles.



“You’re just as bad as she is, aren’t you.” Dusty says.



“Probably worse, considering I have reached the epitome of ‘no consequences’.” Jack says. “Nothing is quite fond of you as well, something about electricity I refused to allow her to elaborate on.”



Dusty laughs. “Has she always been like this?”



“Oh, yes.” Jack says. “She is who she is, and if you don’t like it, fuck you.”





“Do you know what that key goes to?” Dusty asks.



Jack shakes his head. “No, I-”



He stops talking and turns, someone is coming down the stairs. May stops in the doorway, looking back and forth between them.



“Y’all in here talking about me?” May walks over and runs her hand through Jack, it passes straight through and he makes a face, he can clearly feel it.



“Always, my dear.” Jack brushes at his torso where her hand had gone through.



May climbs onto Dusty’s lap and pulls a blanket over her legs, points to the ghost. “That’s Jack. He built this house.”



“So I gathered.” Dusty says.



“You know where Fuckface and Chickenshit are?” May asks.



“I believe they’re in Fern Hill.” Jack says.



“Hugo, wake the fuck up.” May says in a much calmer tone than she’d used earlier.



The cow painting converts into the display screen again, May snaps a few instructions and it brings up one of the complicated visual representations that looks like a complex 3-D figure mapped out in little connecting spots.



“We need a night flier.” May says.



“Sorry, you prefer foxes to owls.” Jack says. “If you want more predators, we’re going to need a rodent infestation.”



“What are they eating now?” May asks.



“Rats, mice, voles…” Jack says.



“Hugo, select twenty adult individuals Rattus norvegicus subtype Fancy Rat please.” May says. “Remove lactating females. Ooh, select an additional six individuals under the same parameters. Trace pattern, Urban Specialization, exclude all below moderate-high.”



The display has been flickering through graphics rapidly, now it stops, showing eight little rat icons. They each expand, showing the rat they represent. One of them is the normal color you’d expect for a rat, the rest of them have large white markings, one is a shade of pale pink and one is white with red eyes.



“Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.” May claps her hands. “And it’s snowing, too, how beautifully thematic. Hugo, Rose Bush my rats!”



May wiggles on Dusty’s lap, he and Jack look at eachother blankly. Jack shrugs, May giggles. There is a very small, tiny, low tapping on the front door.



“Can somebody get that?” May asks.



“No.” Jack says.



“You’re sitting on me.” Dusty says.



“It’s open!” May shouts.



There is a flurry of tiny sounds, then the door clicks open. The group of rats has constructed a small set of stairs leading up to the doorknob, and a set of weights and pulleys to turn it. The rats bound in, push the door closed behind them, then line up in front of May and look at her with bright eyes. They’re all wearing winter wear, little hats, scarves, and knit sweaters.



“Why’d she leave the key up on the table?” May asks them.



The Jackdaw that’s been hanging around swoops down, drops the key in front of the rats. One of them, the brown one, picks it up and turns it over in their little hands. The other rats converge, talking to each other in high pitched squeaks.



One of the rats runs over to the baseboard, fishes a small piece of chalk out of it’s sweater, and draws a little arch. It turns to look at May, waves it’s hands and squeaks loudly several times. May groans, stands up and goes over, drops down onto all fours with her ass in the air. Jack looks over at her, lifts his hand and makes a motion like he’s about to slap her rear, then thinks better of it. May flicks the baseboard inside the outline, it immediately goes dark. The rats stream off through the hole in the wall and vanish, taking the key with them.



The door clicks open again and they all look over. It’s another rat, a brown one with a white belly, this one isn’t wearing any clothes. It scampers somewhat cautiously across the floor, stops in front of May and looks up at her, then squeaks several times.



“Oh, sorry!” May holds her hand down and the rat climbs up, May holds it up to look at it. “Well, well, there is always that one asshole rat. Alright, Mosquito Bandito, you gonna be my special boy. Hugo! Thing my Rat!”



May puts the rat back down, it glows briefly bright blue, it’s shape morphing and growing larger. The proportions shift, the neck, legs, and body extend, shaggy fur grows, giving it a furry tail and ruff. The light fades, there’s something standing there that looks almost like a dog. Dusty narrows his eyes at it, the animal is black, white, and red, a strange pattern of blotchy shapes and lines that looks almost like the foam left on a beach when a wave retreats. It’s ears are large and round, set up near the top of it’s head, like the ears of a rodent.



“Oh, my Best Beloved.” May says.



The animal turns and trots out, there’s a dog flap in the front door now and it vanishes through. Dusty twists around to watch it glide off across the snow, moving very fast.



“Alright, I give up.” Dusty says.



“Lycaon pictus, the Painted Wolf.” Jack says. “Striking, but Canus lupus would have been much more appropriate.”



“Oh, boo.” May waves at him. “Take it up with Hugo. Alright, this is gonna take however long it takes.”



\---



Rahal comes downstairs to find May and Dusty asleep on the couch in the living room, and a dead man in the chair watching them. He sees her looking, gets up and walks across the room and out into the entryway with her. He’s manifesting strongly enough to make the environment react, she can hear the boards creaking under his feet. This isn’t just a visual echo or some sort of parasitic organism, which is what you run into most often in situations like this. This is someone, a person who was alive, who stepped out of his body but did not leave. He’s a real ghost, and he’s haunting this house.



“I thought there weren’t supposed to be ghosts on Rycacia.” Rahal says.



The dead man chuckles. “Technically, we aren’t on Rycacia.”



“You’re lying, Jack.” Rahal says. “But whatever. Do you know her, or did you just die here?”



“Very good! And both.” He says.



“Yeah, my uncle wouldn’t leave, either. I take it you’re the human she hooked up with.” Rahal looks him up and down. “Were you still alive then?”



“Of course I was, don’t be ridiculous. That would have been infuriating.” He laughs. “I am, unfortunately, completely immaterial at this point. I can touch...Nothing.”



“I bet you can.” Rahal says. “You know anything about whatever’s going on here?”



“I know May is going to beat the shit out of my brother when she catches him.” He says. “I would have but, you know, I can’t.”



“I take it there aren’t any malicious spirits in here with you.” Rahal says.



“Not the kind worth worrying about.” Jack says. “What do you do, girl?”



“Me? Oh, I dunno. Help May out, I guess.” Rahal shrugs.



“In what way?” Jack asks.



“She mostly gets me to file paperwork. Hey, when are you from? Do you know anything about those books out there?” Rahal asks.



“You’ll need to be more specific, my dear, there are rather a lot of books in this house.” Jack says.



“The ones with codes in them.” Rahal says. “Diesel said they were for a computer?”



“Ah, yes. Is there something specific or…” Jack asks.



“Can you use that for something that isn’t a computer?” Rahal asks.



“Of course.” Jack says. “It’s just instructions, you can feed it into anything that will accept it.”



“Ok, and that is…” Rahal prompts.



“A machine.” Jack says.



“So, a computer or a robot or something?” Rahal says.



“Yes…” Jack lets the word trail off.



“She calls them biological machines, May, the assets…” Rahal says. “And the flora.”



“Mm-hm.” Jack says. “It’s not from here, though.”



“No. It’s from Earth.” Rahal says. “Does it...no, it can’t. You can’t make it work like that, can you?”



“Magic, do as you will.” Jack says, and fades away.



Rahal looks back in at May and Dusty asleep on the couch, shakes her head slowly, then goes into the kitchen and puts the kettle on. She stands there as she waits for it to boil, looking around. This isn’t a house, it’s not a physical object at all. This whole thing, the house and the yard, it’s like a computer. And it’s connected, hard wired apparently, into a network, a system, something. It’s not real, none of it is real, this place isn’t a place, it’s a visual interface.



The kettle starts to gear up to a whistle and she pulls it off the heat. Rahal senses something else in the room and looks over. A large white rabbit has appeared on the kitchen table, it has pink eyes and a bowler hat.



“Show me how it works.” Rahal says.



The rabbit stands up on it’s hind legs, does a brief little tap dance. The kitchen floor drops down, a replacement seems to roll over it from above. They go down what seems like a very long way, there are dark stones around them, then it opens up and they are in a large library. The rabbit hops out, climbs a ladder and kicks something off of a shelf.



Rahal goes over and picks it up. It’s a note book, a paper one with a spiral of wire holding the pages together. The word “HUGO” has been written on the front in block letters. She flips it open, it’s full of neat lines of code, letters and numbers and blocks of text defining commands and making notes. It’s all been done by hand, she can see that multiple writing implements were used so it must have been over a period of time, but none of it is May’s handwriting.



The kitchen snaps back into place faster than she had expected, May and Dusty are still asleep in the library. The rabbit has found the bowl of fruit on the table and is helping itself, Rahal gives it the apple and banana it’s already taken chunks out of but puts the rest on the counter out of reach.



The water in the kettle is still almost at a boil, they’d only been gone for a minute. Rahal finds coffee and tea in a cabinet, it takes her a few minutes to find the sugar since it’s in a clay container instead of a bag or plastic box. The milk in the fridge looks funny, there’s a thick layer on top but it smells OK. After looking at it for what feels like a very long time Rahal realizes it’s probably just straight out of a cow and hasn’t had all the fat stripped off.



She sits down at the table and starts flipping through the book. The rabbit finishes the fruit and carefully licks it’s entire body clean.



“What’s a ‘TH x T’ gate?” Rahal asks. “No, wait, what does the ‘TH’ in there mean?”



The rabbit sits up, a small blackboard appears on a stand beside it. The rabbit writes something with chalk, then moves so she can see.



“Thaumaturgical Gate.” Rahal reads, saying the word slowly. “Ok, um...give me a definition.”



“Magic Door.” The rabbit writes.



“Yeah, no, um, define ‘thauma… thaumaturgy I guess?” Rahal hazards the word ending, English is really weird about shit like that but it also doesn’t really seem to matter all that much.



Either she’d picked the right one or it understood her anyway. The rabbit takes off it’s hat and puts it on the table with the open side up, dives into it, then emerges a few seconds later holding a book.



“Practical Thaumaturgy, a beginners guide.” Rahal says. “Ok, that’s...helpful.”



“Ugh, why you wanna fuck with that shit.” May asks from behind her and Rahal jumps.



“What is this?” Rahal waves the book at her.



“Stupid fuckin witchery.” May says. “Don’t you be pullin that ‘I can’t do it on a wall’ bullshit on me, I swear, I will…”



“What is going on!” Rahal snaps.



“Yer a wizard, Harry.” May says.



“Boss.” Rahal groans.



“Oh, for fuck sake, like you didn’t know. Y’all always act so fuckin shocked, oh my god, magic? I had no idea? Fuck you say, like you don’t hide that shit from every other human you run into.” May waves a hand at her.



“But I’m not a witch!” Rahal protests.



“Of course you’re not, witches are annoying as shit!” May waves her arms. “You just alter the goddamn source at the fuckin source like you should without all this bullshit about rocks and candles and settin off my goddamn allergies with all that incen-” May dodges as Rahal swats at her with the book.



“I hate you.” Rahal says.



“No you don’t.” May grins. “You love me. You’re mine, girly, deal with it.” She reaches out and swoops the white rabbit up into her arms, it struggles slightly then gives up. “Why Professor Browne, how appropriate. Sub-sti-tutiary locomotion, mystic power that’s beyond the wildest notion…” She sings the last bit to the rabbit, who wiggles it’s nose in a rather annoyed way.



“Ok, fine, tell me what this is. Seriously, stop this bullshit.” Rahal says.



May rolls her eyes. “The wire connects to the sub-dimensional network.”



“Boss, no, seriously.” Rahal says.



“Signals travel from the user to the machine via the astral plane.” Jack has taken pity on her and appeared. “If you don’t give them a valid destination, they will be dumped into the system as a whole, it’ll affect everything unless you tell it specifically what to do and not do. When you have enough people all shooting nonsense commands at it at once, it’s going to zero most of them out, no effect, the script will be automatically removed.”



“Alright, so you can throw commands at Hugo and it’ll just apply them universally if you don’t specify.” Rahal says. “That’s why you need all this shit to tell it exactly how to do things, if you care.”



“And of course there are hotkeys for frequently used tasks.” Jack says.



May groans. “See, this is why I don’t do it this way.”



“She understands, sweetheart.” Jack says.



“And I learned to code in 1988.” May says.



“I have seen you make that machine in the office run Photoshop CS2.” Jack says.



“Yeah, well that’s all it does, so take that, smarty pants.” May says.



“I can’t…” Rahal sighs. “Alright, you’re playing dressup.” She points at Jack. “Did May really marry someone who runs around in a suit all the time?”



“Ooh, she called you, honey!” May snaps and points at Jack. “I do love this look, though, very Detective Robinson.”



“I thought so.” Jack says. “More appropriate for a haunting, don’t you think?”



“For Chickenshit? Totally. You’d have been better off going for, like, a nanny dress or some shit.” May says.



“I am not pulling one of your Lady in Black schemes, thank you.” Jack says.



“But it’s so much fun!” May says.



“You’re not a ghost!” Rahal says suddenly.



Jack looks over at her. “I’m not? I’m certainly dead.”



“Yeah, but no, ghosts do not act like you. You had one foot in and one foot out anyway, you just dumped the body because it was broken.” Rahal says.



“Shit, where the fuck did you grow up?” Jack asks.



“Cagaria.” Rahal says.



“Oh. Oh, yeah, that explains it.” Jack rolls his eyes. “Your uncle was the only one hanging around?”



“He was an asshole, scared everybody else off.” Rahal says. “They totally wrecked the next block, you could see them throwing shit around, finally just trashed the whole thing and put a playground there, so that went super well. They had one of those spinny things for like three hours before it went flying off, I think they found it in the bay a week later. The kids got thrown off before that, thankfully, but…”



“Humans be human.” May says. “Ok, seriously, though, if you wanna play around with that shit, I have some stuff you can do.”



“I don’t wanna mess things up.” Rahal says.



“Where do cats poop?” May asks.

Here, the methodology of magic may be a mystery, but the effects are nothing special. The Controllers can literally make the entire environment unsurvivable with ease, the Marasats and some of the Rycacacions can literally electrocute someone, and May’s folks can simply teleport at will if they have no defense. May even has control over where she ends up, thanks to Nothing. 

  


May enjoys, or at least had enjoyed at the time, performing on stage, which is how Walker became acquainted with her on more than a passing level. That had been on the Karakachan, an ISTC space station in an area humans got to all by themselves.



He was told one day that someone was coming in to set up a long distance transportation system, but usually got there quite a bit early and would need to be provided for. After a bit more of an explanation of what this person would be doing, both in terms of setting the gate and acting as an official representative of her species, Walker had assumed she would be business like, probably in some uniform, and easy to spot. 

  


Two strangers had appeared in the officers lounge. Well, not literally, and they weren’t complete strangers, Walker had seen both of them but had no idea who they were. He had assumed they were associated romantically with one or more people here, or were related to them, or something like that. They certainly didn’t look official. 

  


One of them looked like a fortune teller in some old movie, but without the scarf around her head. Long skirt, shawl, some sort of peasant shirt. The other one had a short dress long jacket combo, lost the jacket pretty quick and was dancing around.



She’d eventually hollered up at them to play Fleetwood Mac, and Walker had said nobody in the band could sing it, and the stranger had immediately climbed up on stage and, through a combination of begging and wiggling, gotten them to do “Dreams”. She had stepped over but refused to get down afterward and sung backup until folks started bowing out, then kept going until Walker had finally put down the guitar. By that time, it was just them and her friend, who had pulled out a novel and was more or less ignoring them. 

  


Walker had introduced himself, she said she knew who he was. He’d had to ask her for her name, she said she was May and the other girl was her sister, JJ. JJ had waved without looking up. He’d asked if they had seen anybody else in the landing area when they came in, May had given JJ an amused look and shaken her head. 

  


She had asked why, and Walker had told her. He’d wondered, later that night, why he had readily given that information to a completely unknown entity. He’s not sure if it’s some psychic power or she just has that ‘mom’ look down pat, you think twice before lying to her. 

  


“You’re waiting for some sort of...diplomat?” May had asked. 

  


“I suppose. They’re supposed to do the gate, too.” Walker said. 

  


“Do you know what they look like?” May asked. 

  


“No idea.” Walker said. “I assume some sort of official looking person.” 

  


“Why?” May asked. 

  


“Why what?” Walker had been confused. 

  


“Why do you think they would look like some ‘official’ person?” May asked. 

  


“Oh, well, I mean, they are an official.” Walker said. 

  


“Oh, I see. And you know what those officials look like? Can you describe the uniform? There are lots of people in uniform here, I might have seen them and not known what I was looking at.” May had said. 

  


“I don’t know.” Walker says. 

  


“That’s useless. Why are you looking for someone who looks a certain way if you don’t know what they’re supposed to look like?” May asked. “Maybe they run around naked.” 

  


“I don’t think so.” Walker said. 

  


“They don’t. I’m just saying…” May had shrugged. 

  


“Well, they would probably have checked in at the head office, right?” Walker asked. 

  


“I dunno, would they?” May asked. 

  


“It’s protocol.” Walker said. 

  


“For who?” May asked. 

  


“ISTC.” Walker said. 

  


“Uh huh, are they ISTC?” May asked. 

  


“Well, yeah, I mean…” Walker had hesitated. 

  


“I think those people are contracted out for stuff like this. I don’t think ISTC actually hires them, they just get paid by ISTC to do it.” May said. “I mean, I could be wrong. What do I know?” 



“What...do you know?” Walker had asked rather slowly.



“Nothing.” May said, then started laughing. JJ had rolled her eyes, apparently it was some sort of inside joke.



It took another two weeks and Walker becoming steadily more anxious for May to finally take mercy on him. Of course, she’d done that by offering to set the gate herself, while she was wearing very little clothing and obviously under the influence of some substance that was probably illegal. He’d politely but rather sarcastically refused, thankfully May was vastly entertained by the whole situation and kept laughing uncontrollably every time she looked at him until JJ finally came over, shoved her out of the way, pointed to her in irritation and identified her as the Gate Tech.



Walker still hadn’t really believed her. May had spun over, grabbed his hand, and yanked him to a bonfire somewhere in Ireland. She hadn’t brought him back until he’d helped round up and shear a large flock of sheep the next day. He hadn’t minded working with the sheep, the biggest issues was that he didn’t have proper shoes and kept slipping on the wet grass, but half the folks were still hung over from the night before so it didn’t matter all that much, everybody was falling all over the place, anyway.



May had leaned on the fence and watched them, she was the only one who didn’t seem to be doing any work but nobody seemed to mind. They all obviously knew her, Walker couldn’t tell if it was where May was from or not because she didn’t use a translator and was talking just like them, but he wasn’t familiar enough with the dialect to know if she’d have an ‘accent’ or not.



The farmers singled out some sheep and put them in a smaller pen while the others got tossed back into the large field. When they finished, May ambled over to look at the group of sheep.



“Ewe, ewe, and...ewe.” May pointed, the three sheep moved away from the group. “Baaaa, Raaaam, Eeeewe!” She clapped her hands and then waved her fingers at the sheep. Another three animals appeared, they look exactly like the ones standing there already. “Dolly!” May said. The sheep multiplied again, there were twenty of them now, the new ones had a full coat of wool. “Sweet, now...You!” May jabbed a finger at another sheep. “C’mere, I like the look of you. Rose Bush Shaun the Sheep!” May clapped and waved her fingers again.



“Baah?” The sheep asked.



“Yeh, those are your ladies.” May said “Keep them out of trouble, yeah?”



“Baah.” The sheep nodded.



“Tommy! Come get yo wool factory!” May screamed, making Walker jump.



A young man had ambled over, looked at the sheep, then over at May. “Seriously?”



“Do it yourself then.” May said.



“He’s gonna get into everything.” Tommy said.



“Of course he is.” May grinned. “Oh, come on! You love that show!”



“When I was five!” Tommy protested.



“Well, you can relive your childhood, then.” May had said. “I do it all the time, it’s brilliant.”



Tommy had looked over at Walker and shaken his head. “Can you believe her?”



“No.” Walker had said flatly.



“Mom.” Tommy had rolled his eyes. “He’s some poor dope from ISTC, isn’t he. Sorry about this, man, she thinks it’s funny.”



“It is.” May had said. “And he’s not some ISTC dope, he just ain’t figured out these folks worship in the Temple of the Trees.”



Walker froze, then slowly looked around. He hadn’t seen it before because he hadn’t been looking for it, he’d stopped looking for it because if you look, you’ll see it, even when it isn’t there. That’s part of what it does, how it hides itself, it creates an illusion of being there, so you’ll think the reality is an illusion as well when you come across it.



The dogs, little black and white border collies, he’d thought they must all be related because they looked similar. There were half a dozen just sitting around the yard by then, though, and looking at them Walker realized they didn’t look similar, they looked exactly the same. The only difference between dogs was the amount and placement of dirt, grass, and sheep manure adhered to their fur. He looked up, over at the dogs that were still out moving around. They were dividing the sheep up, moving them into different pens, but no people were paying any attention. They dogs were doing it all completely by themselves. Walker thought that was probably possible, if they did the same thing each time the dogs could probably do it without supervision. It’s always going to be in the realm of possibility, though, it’s just going to be somewhere far out on the end.



The door of the barn had some sort of decoration painted on it, he’d actually looked at it then and realized it wasn’t a flower as he’d first thought, it was a Knot, a constant spell that shifted probability slightly in the favor of whatever living things were inside. They were on all the other buildings, too, either painted on or sewn into the curtains or hanging as flags. He saw some quilts with Knots on them hanging on a line to dry.



The pen the sheep had been moved into was sitting inside of a low wall- a circle of stone. He stared at it for several seconds, then lifted his hand and snapped his fingers. The circle flashed, a line of ghost flame raced around then went out, an indication the circle was set to receive instructions automatically from anyone.



May had been practically dancing in place as she watched him look around, Tommy looked like he was about to experience an eyeroll induced medical emergency.



“Why do you do this?” Tommy asked.



“Look at him!” May waved a hand at Walker.



“Yeah, yeah, I see.” Tommy said. “You found a witch, good job.”



May cackled. “Who do Voodoo?”



Walker had stared at her for a very long time, trying to figure out exactly what to say. The little ram May had done...whatever...to had gotten hold of a fiddle and started to play, May and the dogs all started dancing.



“Oh, for fuck sake.” Tommy had groaned. “Sorry about this, man, she’s so fucking weird. Wizard of Oz that shit, she’ll take you back.”



“Wizard…” Walker had started to ask, but Tommy had walked away. Of course he had, he wouldn’t be that much more forthcoming than his mother in a situation like this.



Walker went and sat down on a stump in the barnyard, looking at the activity around him. He was seeing it all over now, the way the people moved and did things, the way they’d snap or wave at objects and get a response, the way they just talked to the animals like they were other people. This is literally a magical area, a place where it permeates everything so deeply that it takes very little power or skill to touch and manipulate it.



“Baaa?” The little ram had come over.



“I need to get back to the station.” Walker said.



“Baaa.” The ram motioned toward May with his head.



“Yeah, but...I don’t think she’ll take me back if I just say ‘take me back’, things don’t work that way with people like her. I think I insulted her.” Walker says. “I didn’t realize who she was.”



“Baah.” The ram waved the statement away. “Baa baa, baa baa baa baa baa baa *baaaah*.”



“What’s the right way?” Walker asks.



The little sheep stands up on his hind legs, clears his throat, then clicks his little rear hooves together three times. “Baa baa baa baa baa.”



“What?” Walker laughed.



“Baah.” The sheep nodded. “Baa baa baa baabaa.”



Walker had sighed, stood up, and feeling very silly, clicked his heels together three times. “There’s no place like home.”



There had been a very brief feeling of something blowing in his face, making him blink, and then he was standing on something hard and the world had gone dark. Not actually dark, though, it just took a second for his eyes to adjust from the bright outdoor sunlight to the dim interior of his quarters on the Karakachan. May was standing beside him, she had one of the border collies in her arms. She dropped the dog, which had immediately gotten into his bunk and rolled until most of the muck had been deposited on his bedding.



May hasn’t gotten much easier to deal with since then. Things had gotten a little better when he realized the best way to get her to actually do anything was to just demand she stop fucking around and get on with it.



The window in the pot bellied stove lights up yellow as it begins to emit heat. There isn’t an actual flame in there, just flora, the color is aesthetic. Something under the house, or maybe in the walls, rumbles softly, and the windows steam up then almost immediately begin to frost over. Walker looks through the quickly diminishing circle of clear glass that is the kitchen window. The pasture is empty, blanketed in thick snow, chimneys on either side of the barn are sending out plumes of either steam or smoke. 

  


A black dot emerges from the snowy sky, swoops down across the pasture and vanishes onto the porch. A few seconds later, Justin hops in through the doggie door and shakes snow from his feathers. 

  


“Do you have my change?” JJ asks. 

  


Justin has a small object in his mouth, he puts it down between his feet to talk. “I had to take the bus.” 

  


“You have wings.” JJ says. 

  


“I got tired.” Justin picks the object up again, flies over to the table and lands on JJ’s plate. She makes a face and pushes the plate and bird away, then holds out her hand. Justin drops the object into it and begins pecking at her scrambled eggs. 

  


Walker comes over to look, Justin has given JJ a ring, just a simple band with what might be a decoration or inscription in some language he doesn’t recognize, sized for a human male. JJ turns it over several times in her hand, frowning slightly. 

  


“That doesn’t look like Kelsey’s style.” Walker says. “Does it mean anything to you?” 

  


JJ shakes her head slowly. “It sure as hell means something to May. She used to keep it around her neck, way back when.” 

  


“You think she lost it?” Walker asks. 

  


“Maybe.” JJ says. “Or maybe she left it somewhere.” 

  


“At a marine animal park?” Walker asks. “I suppose if she was swimming around…” 

  


“Justin, where did you get this?” JJ asks. 

  


“Bought it off the Jackdaw.” Justin says. 

  


“Who does the Jackdaw work for?” Walker asks. 

  


“I think…” JJ says slowly. “It’s the same person that May with that ring doth wed.”



“Is she married?” Walker asks.



“Oh, the man gave her that ring, he stepped over a long, long time ago.” JJ says.



“Sometimes, they come back.” Walker says.



“Sometimes, they never leave.” JJ says.

May takes several steps back from the control center, puts her hand to her face as she contemplates something. She triggers her onboard radio. “Rahal, will you come down to the lift building please? And bring Diesel if she’s available.” 

  


Rahal jumps when her radio goes off, then laughs sheepishly. “Boss wants us. May, I mean.” 

  


Diesel snorts. “Do you always call her that?” 

  


“I guess.” Rahal shrugs. “I mean, she is.” 

  


As they walk down the now enclosed hall to the lift building, Diesel slows down and narrows her eyes. She can hear the flora here humming, it’s pulling a ton of power, but there’s something else, too. It’s a sound that’s not a sound, coming right into her head, one she’s heard before but not this loud. This sounds like music, the kind that makes you start to move with the beat without realizing it. 

  


There’s a floral door at the end. When they approach, the flora pulls back, it should reveal whatever is inside the old lift building, but it doesn’t. There’s a round door that spins, pieces slot into place, then it withdraws like an iris into the wall. 

  


“Holy shit.” Diesel says. 

  


“Woah. What is that?” Rahal hesitates, but May motions them in. 

  


“Hugo.” May says. “Well, part of Hugo. We’re about to do a little…renovating. Now, lets see if that damn crow did his job…Hugo, test point one. Test point two. Third times the charm…oh yeah, now we’re cookin with gas.” May claps her hands. “Signal test, jack that shit!” 

  


The display flickers, someone wearing a rubber mask of a man with blonde hair and sunglasses against a moving background of black and white stripes, apparently mocking the camera. It vanishes after a moment and is replaced by some sort of complicated graphic that seems to be mapping something in multiple dimensions. 

  


“Alright, let's see what we got here. Lock it down, Hugo!” 

  


The graphic changes, there are now several more or less direct lines taking different routes between two more brightly glowing dots. May waves at the display and the figure rotates in different directions. 

  


“What do you think?” May asks. 

  


“Not a fan of this one.” Nothing points. “That area is scheduled for reclamation.” 

  


“Right then. Let’s see…Blind mice up the clock…There we go, that’s right by Oakleaf Plaza.” May glances over at Rahal and Diesel. “Works better if I know where we’re going.” 

  


“Are we going to move?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Hugo cannot move Hugo. And you ‘bout to see what we’re gonna do. Alright, here goes Nothing.” May steps back, points at the control console. “Let’s blow this pop stand!” 

  


Halfway across the planet, the house that had most recently been occupied by Adrian Kelsey collects snow. A plume of smoke drifts lazily from the chimney, the windows glow yellow, the front walk is conspicuously clear. Inside, the grandfather clock, which had started ticking away again nearly an hour ago, begins to strike thirteen. 

  


The display screen drops down below the console, leaving a flat surface. Nothing shimmers into existence above the controls, from the waist up and several times larger than she had appeared before. She lifts her arms, morphs into a complicated flowerlike figure that expands, curls down over the walls. 

  


“Aaaand…runaway!” May claps her hands loudly, making Diesel and Rahal jump. 

  


There is the extremely uncomfortable feeling of the universe being flapped like a bedsheet, followed by the distinct impression that sections of reality have abruptly moved slightly in one direction or another. Then they are plunged into darkness, or what seems like darkness in comparison to the light show they’d been standing in. 

  


When their eyes adjust, Rahal and Diesel realize they’re standing in a very old-style house, wood on the floor, paper on the walls, rugs with complicated designs. It’s not really a period repro, though, just an old house, there’s some stuff here that is absolutely modern. 

  


May makes an angry noise. “Holy shit, seriously!” 

  


Dusty laughs. “Looks like you got a pest infection.” 

  


“Who the fuck left all my books out!” May throws her hands in the air. “And…is this cake? Children! Literal goddamn children! Look! Look at the mess you made!” 

  


May jabs a finger at Rahal, who steps back. “Me? I’ve never even been here before.” 

  


“Not you, you, you…” May makes a frustrated motion. 

  


“Filthy little lemurs?” Rahal suggests. 

  


May snaps her fingers and points at her. “See, she gets it.” 

  


Diesel walks over and looks through a window, she can’t see anything except a ring of trees covered in snow. “Where are we?” 

  


“Should be West Sunset, couple miles from JJ’s.” May says. 

  


“We’re in Hangdog?” Rahal says. 

  


“Yeah.” May says. “I told you, Hugo isn’t a ship. Hugo is a semi-portable stable gate array system.” 

  


“Ok, ok, so…this is your house, right?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Damn straight it is, little shit pulling shenanigans. Steal my house will you…” May grumbles angrily. “Ooh, I hope they’re around, I am *just* in the mood.” 

  


“This might sound like a stupid question but…how do we get back? To Factory Road, I mean.” Rahal says. 

  


“Not a stupid question at all.” May says. “Come hither.” 

  


They follow her to a door with a sign taped to it requesting people not kick it. Rahal arches an eyebrow, May opens the door. Steps lead down to a basement that obviously serves as a sitting area, there are couches and chairs and a very old looking TV. May opens another door, bright light pours out. It’s the control room inside what had been the old lift building. 

  


“You just step over.” Rahal says weakly. 

  


“Yep.” May says. 



\---

  
  


“Sweet baby Jesus!” JJ yelps as her coffee sloshes. “Every goddamn time, I swear she knows when I have a souffle in the oven!” 

  


“Fucking hell!” Walker snarls as his card castle is reduced to a pile of rubble. 

  


The phone rings. JJ looks over and rolls her eyes, she shouldn’t have an ancient yellow landline phone but there it is. Of course it’s one that weighs twenty pounds, couldn’t send a slimline cordless or something. 

  


“What.” JJ says into the receiver. “What? No! I don’t care where you are, do you have any idea…I know, it’s three feet- No they don’t have cleats!” 

  


Walker groans. “What is wrong with her, seriously. Give me the phone. May. May! Yes, yes, good to hear you, too, look…Where? Alright, I understand but…Yes, I’m sorry, I know we should have cleaned it up.” Walker sighs and holds the receiver away from his ear, May is ranting about the library. “There aren’t any ants here! Well, how would a roach…why would it ride in on my clothes! Why can’t JJ have roaches!” 

  


“I do not have roaches.” JJ says. 

  


“Neither do I. Neither does May.” Walker says. “Alright, alright, my deepest apologies. That  doesn’t help the fact that the roads are nigh impassable at the moment. Yes, yes, I suppose you do. Alright. See you in a bit.” 

  


Walker hangs up the phone and puts a hand over his face, draws it slowly down. “She’s coming over here.” 



May hangs up the phone, which is yellow plastic and shaped like a banana. “Alright, I guess I’m gonna go over there. Y’all don’t mess my shit up. JJ’s Kids!” May claps her hands loudly and vanishes into thin air.

  


Rahal and Diesel both jump, Dusty doesn’t seem surprised. There are voices from the basement, a second later Vincent appears loudly telling someone, probably Benni, that it’s totally fine. 

  


\---

Benni yelps as the building seems to shift a few inches, looks around expecting something else to happen and jumps when a ball rolls off of a shelf and bounces on the floor. She goes out to find Vincent, Mac, and Rick standing in the lobby, looking around. 

  


“Did you guys feel that?” Benni asks. 

  


“That’s Hugo, isn’t it?” Mac asks. 

  


“Yeah.” Vincent says. 

  


“Who’s Hugo?” Benni asks. 

  


“Come on.” Rick waves at her. 

  


The door at the end of the hall into what used to be the lift building ends in an ornate round door. It rotates open as they approach, apparently not concerned about security, or maybe programmed to let them in. 

  


“Oh, wow.” Benni hesitates, but the guys walk right in so she follows them. “This is the gate array control system, isn’t it.” 

  


“Yep.” Vincent says. “She’s a pro, I’m telling you. That little wrinkle we just felt? That was a gate going in. There’s only one other door in here, so that’s gonna be it.” 

  


“Oh, it’s nice in here.” Vincent says. 

  


“Yeah, I think this is the House that Jack Built.” Dusty says. 

  


“Which is…” Rahal prompts. 

  


“It’s the body, Hugo is the engine.” Dusty says.

  


“Sorry?” Rahal asks.

  


“It’s the hull of the ship.” Dusty says. “If it was a ship. It’s the outside that Hugo is inside, all the other shit either is in here or connects to it.”

  


“Is there...more of it? Like, underground?” Rahal asks.

  


“It’s a tesseract.” Dusty says.

  


“Oh.” Rahal says. “Oh, of course they can do that, duh. Are all of them this...weird...about it?”

  


“I dunno, the only other one’s I’ve really talked to are her kin, and they’re certainly birds of a feather.” Dusty laughs. “She does like messing with people, though, and Nothing just eggs her on. She probably figured you weren’t enough of a sucker for that, though.”

  


“She talked to me one time.” Rahal says. “May was asleep.”

  


“Yeah, she’ll sit over her sometimes. I don’t think May knows. She’s worried about her, I guess, or maybe she just likes looking at her and can’t do it when she’s out running around or folks will see her.” Dusty says.

  


“That’s really sweet.” Rahal says.

  


“Yeah, she generally is.” Dusty says. “She’ll get nasty real quick if she thinks you have bad intentions, though. She does not trust humans, it takes awhile for May to convince her somebody is actually OK.”

  


“Oh.” Rahal says. “Oh, is that why it took so long for her to actually start talking to me?”

  


“Probably.” Dusty says. “See, you are special. Nothing likes you, a lot. Enough to let May put her life in your hands out there. She trusts Walker and JJ, she loves Jim but she knew who he was already. She likes Jack because he took it upon himself to fish May out of some serious shit and they’d both be dead otherwise.”

  


Rahal walks over and begins looking at the books. They look very, very old, but when she opens them, she can read the text. A bunch of them are obviously fiction books, she starts sorting them into piles. 

  


Then she picks up one and flips it open, and stops. She recognizes the stuff inside, well, she can see it’s familiar, just using slightly different arrangements and sequences, different abbreviations, but…she knows this. 

  


“What are these?” Rahal looks around. 

  


Diesel looks over her shoulder, takes the book. “Ooh, Arch. It shows you how to program a computer. Like, a real one, the ones humans use.” 

  


“It’s code.” Rahal says. 

  


“Yeah. Here, this is another one, it’ll tell you the operating system usually in the title or front page, and the version…here, see, Linux, Unix, MS DOS…” Diesel flips through the pile. “That’s cool.” 

  


“Why would May have these?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Maybe she has to program her…whatever.” Diesel shrugs. “Or maybe, I mean if she sits around in places for a long time, like, you had to do all this yourself when humans first started using computers. Like, program it all by yourself.” 

  


“That seems…time consuming.” Rahal says. 

  


“Yeah, most people didn’t do it and it got to where they could just do stuff by themselves, I mean, through a visual interface. Like you can just ask the system on Falcron for something, you don’t have to, like, program in the way to do it.” Diesel says. 

  


“You can, though.” Rahal says. “You can tell it specifically how you want it to do things, you just have to input the codes directly. Look, there’s even a ‘make’ command!” 

  


“Build and Grow will do stuff outside Hugo.” Dusty says. 

  


“Dad!” Diesel barks. 

  


“What?” Dusty lifts his hands. “I’m just the messenger, I don’t do that hacker shit.” 

  


“So, you understand this?” Benni asks. 

  


Rahal shrugs. “Kinda. I mean, I see how it works, it just calls things different names. I think this is…this is “fetch” from…somewhere…this one makes, like, a container you can put stuff in- like, data- this one…let me see…this is to make like a machine sort of, like, to make something that does something it couldn’t do before…oh, this is asking it to search for a signal from any other ones nearby…” 

  


Rahal turns around slowly, looking at the room. There is one thing that seems very out of place, an incredibly ugly painting of a cow wearing a pink hat. 

  


“Launch Terminal.” Rahal says. 

  


She has a moment where she thinks she’s going to look like an idiot, but the cow vanishes and is replaced with a black screen with a flashing cursor. 

  


“Launch Visual Audio Interface.” Rahal says. The screen stays black, apparently it didn’t accept that input. “Launch Hugo.” Still a black screen. 

  


Dusty puts a hand on her shoulder, smiles. “Hugo! Wake the fuck up!” 

  


The screen flashes, comes up with a background of fish swimming in a stone lined pond. 

  


“Where am I?” Mac asks. 

  


Two maps appear. One shows the surface of Rycacia, one shows what looks like the blueprints for a building. The one of the surface indicates they are in Hangdog City, it zooms in to show they are off of West Sunset, which is a few miles from JJs farm. The other seems to be the house they are in now, it labels the upstairs as ‘bedrooms’ and the downstairs as ‘kitchen’, ‘library’, etc. There is a door in the basement that has a thin line connecting it to a room labeled ‘Factory’, which is a different color than the rest. 

  


“It’s only connected to one other place right now.” Dusty says. “That’s the lift building there.” 

  




\---

JJ is walking toward the trash can, loudly bemoaning the loss of her souffle, when she runs smack into May. JJ screams, half in surprise and half in anger, steps back and looks at the mess down her front. 

  


“I cannot believe you!” JJ shoves the dish into May’s hands, pushes past her and stalks away to change clothes. 

  


“Really, the trick is not to open the oven, you know.” May puts the dish down on the counter and looks at Walker, who is giving her an exasperated look. “Hey, man, how you been?” 

  


“Hi.” Walker says, after deciding not to say what he really wants to. “Fine, how are you.” 

  


“Oh, just peachy.” May says. “Look at this snow, that’s really something, huh. Damn, it’s cold in here, too! You know, you can get blown-in insulation for really-” 

  


“You’ve seen the house, then?” Walker says. 

  


“Huh, oh, yeah.” May waves a hand. 

  


“And?” Walker says. 

  


“And?” May says. 

  


“Look, is it a…something?” Walker makes a complicated and apparently meaningless hand gesture. 

  


“Everything is something, Walker.” May pours a cup of coffee and sits down at the table across from him. 

  


“Do we need to worry about it?” Walker says. 

  


“The house? Why would  you worry about it? It’s in great shape, not, like, a hazard if kids get up in there or something.” May says. 

  


“Why? Oh, come on, it’s not…it wasn’t…that is Adrian Kelsey’s house!” Walker snaps. 

  


“No it’s not, little chicken shit.” May says. “That house is going back to it’s rightful owner, thankyouverymuch.” 

  


“Ok, good, so you’re going to take it with you then.” Walker says. 

  


“Ooh, I dunno about that.” May says. “It’ll be OK, though, don’t worry about it.” 

  


“Fine, thank you, I suppose-” Walker says. 

  


“You might have to worry about Kelsey and Penny, though.” May says casually. 

  


“Oh, lord, I knew it.” JJ is coming down the stairs in clean clothes. 

  


“Yeah, they’re totally around somewhere. I betcha they got some bullshit up at Fern Hill, that seems fucking thematic for a couple wackadoos.” May says. 

  


“Well, they must be hiding pretty good.” JJ pulls something out of her pocket and gives it to May. “Here ya go, baby.” 

  


“Thank you, sweetie.” May takes the ring and sticks it under her shirt, presumably into her bra. “They probably wanted to try and force install one of the controllers into the House that Jack Built. That ain’t gonna work anyway, they didn’t bring it here, they got brought cause they were inside the damn thing.” 

  


“I suppose that really would be the only place they could go undetected.” JJ says. “That seems…that place is infested, though.” 

  


“Well, what are a few more fucking pests. She’s probably the goddamn Queen of the Gremlins.” May says. “Ok, I ain’t goin up there in this weather.” 

  


“I’ll get the chalk.” JJ sighs. 

  


Walker watches as JJ pushes a rug aside and draws a circle on the floor, makes markings around the outside. She arranges items, does some sort of complicated looking ritual, then steps back. May looks from JJ to Walker and back. She starts doing her little bouncy dance, apparently powering up. 

  


“Three...Two...One...Contact!” May stamps her foot loudly on the chalk outline, the china on the shelves rattles and JJ winces.

  


The outline lights up, briefly becomes a column of light, then condense into an empty door frame standing in the middle of the room. 

  


“I keep telling you, do them against a wall.” May says. 

  


“I can’t do a full circle with a wall there!” JJ says. 

  


“So bend it! It’s a chalk outline!” May says. 

  


“No, it isn’t! It’s a space-time barrier and it has to be-” JJ protests. 

  


“But it’s not flat anyway, right? It’s not freaking two dimensional, why does the outline matter that much?” May waves her hands. 

  


“It just does!” JJ says. 

  


“Ladies!” Walker says loudly. 

  


In the living room of the House that Jack Built, the display changes. This time it generates a point, the graphic is a circle. It has a label above it, “Th-x-T temp sub-d-8”. The whole thing grays out after a few seconds and “inactive” appears above it. 

  


“What does that label mean?” Rahal asks. 

  


“It’s a magic circle.” May says from behind her, making her jump. 

  


May is standing there, along with two other people. Rahal recognizes one of them as Walker, she assumes the other one must be this JJ person. 

  


“It’s a Thaumaturgical Gate.” Walker says. 

  


“Same thing.” May says. 

  


Walker rolls his eyes. JJ has started talking to Mac and Rick, it sounds like she’s giving them some jucy gossip by the way they keep laughing and shaking their heads. 

  


“You give me a door.” JJ says. “I’m not doing that again.” 

  


May pulls open a drawer and takes out a piece of chalk. She looks at JJ pointedly, waves at them to follow her. She stops at the end of the downstairs hall and makes a pushing motion. The hall gets longer, the door at the end shrinking like a trick shot in a movie. She gives JJ another look, draws a square on the wall with the chalk. 

  


“Oh, for the love of…” Walker groans. 

  


May draws hinges and a door knob on the rectangle, steps back, gives JJ another look. “Beetlejuice…Beetlejuice…*Beetlejuice*!” She smacks the wall, which is now a door, hard with the flat of her hand. 

  


“There, there’s your door. See? On the fucking wall.” May says. 

  


“Can you please explain to her-” JJ says. 

  


“I’ve tried.” Walker says. “Believe me.” 

  


“Well, now we’re all here, let’s have a little party!” May says. “Hey, guys, glad you could make it.”



May has abandoned her professional look, and Benni squints at her. May flashes her a grin and winks, Benni shakes her head. May is starting to dance in place again, as though she has some sort of club mix playing in her head.



“Alright, I’m just going to ignore the fact that you clearly just stole this house-” Walker says. 

  


“Nope, nope, no, nuh-huh. My goddamn house.” May says and stomps her foot, the house reacts by beginning to play techno music.

  


“Fine, fine, whatever. Frankly, I don’t care. But we do need to find Kelsey and Penny.” Walker rolls his eyes as the music increases in volume.

  


“Yep. We needs some eyes in the sky is what we needs.” May says. “Hey, Baby-D, you wanna grab your drones? We can pair them up here, but for now I think…Hugo! Dark Half!” 



The beat drops and here is an eruption of tiny, high pitched sounds that become recognizable as birds chirping. May motions toward a window, the sky and yard are full of little moving dark things flitting about in the snow. Birds, hundreds of them, small brown ones. May has started dancing around.

  


“Sparrows.” May says, making fluttery motions with her hands. “They’re good for a slow sweep, thorough as hell but it’ll take awhile for them to work their way over that far.”

1q0v4mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1q0v4mk/cpps_nonbacterial_prostatitis_is_the_best_thing/,CPPS/ non-bacterial prostatitis is the best thing that happened to me,"Hey everybody, I was meant to make this post for a while but I’ve been off crack (Reddit) for a few years. Came back recently for other reasons and decided to get it done before I quit again.

Im here to tell you not just how I over came  cpps/ non-bacterial prostatitis, but how it improved my life in a way I could never imagine. 

 I completely understand how y’all feeling, in fact, the reason I am writing this post because I remember 5-6 years ago when I was going though my worst/darkest moments facing CPPS, was doomscrolling on reddit one day and found a post like this, it immediately changed my perspective and gave me a light of hope when I was about to give everything up. Im just passing the torch here, and if it can help even just a single person I will be more than happy.

I (33) got cpps  6 years ago when I was 27 and although the whole story on how did I got it is not very relevant, I can tell you it was not an easy time at all , first of all, the fact that it is not affecting any other part of your body but your manhood and making sex/ ejaculation something uncomfortable drops your self steam and your mood below the floor. Apart from not even knowing what the fuck is happening to you after getting wrongly diagnosed by doctors, blood & urine tests coming clear, CT scan, ultrasounds and prostate exams coming clear too.

After many months of endless hassle  and thousands of dollar spent with no results I found a urologist that enlightened me and told me that my issue may be CPPS or non-bacterial prostatitis. That was the first time I ever heard those words. He also related me to a pelvic floor clinic, which I was skeptic at first but ended up going and this was going to be the first baby steps though my healing process.

After knowing the devil by its name, I started doing my own research, searching absolutely everywhere in hopes to find some relief and learn how to deal with it. I ended up in Reddit, and I gotta say it helped me heaps at the beginning, finding this community of people going though similar stuff I was going though, made me feel not so alone and hopeless anymore.  But… after some time it was taking a toll on me as I was just reading posts all day and overcomplicating my situation in my head, plus all the negativity and grief you also read. So as a piece of advice: get out Reddit now, if you been here for a while you most likely have all the information you may need so do yourself a favour and get out. 99% of success stories are not here 

Since then, it has been a journey, on understanding, accepting, fighting and living with CPPS and although it’s been a rough path, it has made me a man I couldn’t even imagine I would become few years ago. 

Today I would consider myself 99% healed, and even though I get flare ups or mild symptoms every now and then I live a normal life like I used to, but now is 100 times better, it is like my dream life, I became  highly successful on businesses that I was struggling for years, I am the closest I have been to family and friends in my whole life, my dating and sex life never been better either, I am going on different dates all the time and can have sex 3-4 times a day with no issues. my mindset is at its peak, as my physique, my health, spirituality and many other aspects. 

I want to emphazise that this battle is as mental as it is physical and healing yourself is not only about your body but also about your mind, it is very likely that this condition is the underlying cause of other problems, traumas and blockages that you might had in your subconscious mind and never faced or are not even aware.

Don’t keep it to yourself, speak it out with your friends or relatives, or if you don’t feel to comfortable, at least go to a psychologist. Just venting it out and hearing other perspectives can help a lot. move yourself, play a sport or a game you like, get distracted, get out of your room, have a walk in nature… dont let it consume you because otherwise it will put you on your knees and tear you apart as it has done to many of us.

 

I know all the cases may different but I will tell you what worked for me and I bet it has for so many others too

\- You need to go to a PFPT, this is a must if you really want to overcome CPPS, I gotta admit I went like 3-4 times and then stopped going but the few times I went I got so much clarity and understandment of the situation which allowed me to start working things out by myself 

\- Stretches are no negotiable either, I used to do them every morning and night before going to bed (game changer) and although I don’t do them as often now they help a lot for flare ups and pelvic floor health in general (you can find many on YouTube or in other posts here)

\- Breathwork is important as well to loosen up the tension in your pelvic floor muscles (you may get some insights from your PT or YouTube videos, look for diaphragm breathing)

\- Reverse Kegels 

\- Hot tubs/ showers/ help a lot too, they will relax your muscles and provide some relief, specially after flare ups or constant pain, add epsom salts if you can

\- Sauna/ Steam room 

\- Reduce Stress 

\- About the mental part, you have to visualise yourself living a normal life again, with a painless and healthy pelvic floor, enjoying sex and intimacy as you used to before, the more vivid and frequently you can recreate it in your mind the sooner it will manifest into reality 

When I started my healing journey, I realised that if I wanted to overcome CPPS completely, just stretches and PFPT was not going to be enough so I decided to make some changes in my daily life, and although CPPS was one of the main reason I started, they have skyrocketed my life in many different aspects as I mentioned before.

\- I stopped masturbating (edging is the worst for your PF) plus it is just shit dopamine you end up paying for later 

\- I stopped drinking coffee 

\- Slowed down on alcohol a lot 

\- Stopped smoking weed non-stop 

\- Started eating as healthy as I could ( organic/ non-processed food mostly)

\- Gave up most spicy food 

\- Drinking heaps of water

\- Started Intermitent fasting 

\- Daily Meditation and Visualisation 

\- Daily work outs

\- Sauna and Steam room multiple times per week 

\- Running and swimming multiple times per week 

\- Not sitting for prolonged times 

\- Massage and dry needling every now and then 

Last but not least, you gotta start living your life like it is normal again, don’t allow CPPS to control your emotions/ actions and most importantly your future, there is people in way worst situations and enduring hardships that we can not even fathom and I am not denying the huge mental toll it can have on us but I’m just saying don’t give it too much power. Everything is a matter of perspective, use this opportunity to improve your life in every aspect as I did, and as soon as you start focusing on yourself you will forget you have CPPS 99% of the time. Trust me on this one 

I love you all and I believe y’all can overcome this, dont give up and stay strong  ",5,1767239840.0,Prostatitis,0,1.0,False
1q0v4lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HangDogCityLimits/comments/1q0v4lj/meet_me_at_hangdog_city_limits_13/,Meet Me at Hangdog City Limits 13,"Humans treat folks like Walker and JJ with respect by instinct. Here, the methodology of magic may be a mystery, but the effects are nothing special. The Controllers can literally make the entire environment unsurvivable with ease, the Marasats and some of the Rycacacions can literally electrocute someone, and May’s folks can simply teleport at will if they have no defense. May even has control over where she ends up, thanks to Nothing. 

  


May enjoys, or at least had enjoyed at the time, performing on stage, which is how Walker became acquainted with her on more than a passing level. That had been on the Karakachan, an ISTC space station in an area humans got to all by themselves.



He was told one day that someone was coming in to set up a long distance transportation system, but usually got there quite a bit early and would need to be provided for. After a bit more of an explanation of what this person would be doing, both in terms of setting the gate and acting as an official representative of her species, Walker had assumed she would be business like, probably in some uniform, and easy to spot. 

  


Two strangers had appeared in the officers lounge. Well, not literally, and they weren’t complete strangers, Walker had seen both of them but had no idea who they were. He had assumed they were associated romantically with one or more people here, or were related to them, or something like that. They certainly didn’t look official. 

  


One of them looked like a fortune teller in some old movie, but without the scarf around her head. Long skirt, shawl, some sort of peasant shirt. The other one had a short dress long jacket combo, lost the jacket pretty quick and was dancing around.



She’d eventually hollered up at them to play Fleetwood Mac, and Walker had said nobody in the band could sing it, and the stranger had immediately climbed up on stage and, through a combination of begging and wiggling, gotten them to do “Dreams”. She had stepped over but refused to get down afterward and sung backup until folks started bowing out, then kept going until Walker had finally put down the guitar. By that time, it was just them and her friend, who had pulled out a novel and was more or less ignoring them. 

  


Walker had introduced himself, she said she knew who he was. He’d had to ask her for her name, she said she was May and the other girl was her sister, JJ. JJ had waved without looking up. He’d asked if they had seen anybody else in the landing area when they came in, May had given JJ an amused look and shaken her head. 

  


She had asked why, and Walker had told her. He’d wondered, later that night, why he had readily given that information to a completely unknown entity. He’s not sure if it’s some psychic power or she just has that ‘mom’ look down pat, you think twice before lying to her. 

  


“You’re waiting for some sort of...diplomat?” May had asked. 

  


“I suppose. They’re supposed to do the gate, too.” Walker said. 

  


“Do you know what they look like?” May asked. 

  


“No idea.” Walker said. “I assume some sort of official looking person.” 

  


“Why?” May asked. 

  


“Why what?” Walker had been confused. 

  


“Why do you think they would look like some ‘official’ person?” May asked. 

  


“Oh, well, I mean, they are an official.” Walker said. 

  


“Oh, I see. And you know what those officials look like? Can you describe the uniform? There are lots of people in uniform here, I might have seen them and not known what I was looking at.” May had said. 

  


“I don’t know.” Walker says. 

  


“That’s useless. Why are you looking for someone who looks a certain way if you don’t know what they’re supposed to look like?” May asked. “Maybe they run around naked.” 

  


“I don’t think so.” Walker said. 

  


“They don’t. I’m just saying…” May had shrugged. 

  


“Well, they would probably have checked in at the head office, right?” Walker asked. 

  


“I dunno, would they?” May asked. 

  


“It’s protocol.” Walker said. 

  


“For who?” May asked. 

  


“ISTC.” Walker said. 

  


“Uh huh, are they ISTC?” May asked. 

  


“Well, yeah, I mean…” Walker had hesitated. 

  


“I think those people are contracted out for stuff like this. I don’t think ISTC actually hires them, they just get paid by ISTC to do it.” May said. “I mean, I could be wrong. What do I know?” 



“What...do you know?” Walker had asked rather slowly.



“Nothing.” May said, then started laughing. JJ had rolled her eyes, apparently it was some sort of inside joke.



It took another two weeks and Walker becoming steadily more anxious for May to finally take mercy on him. Of course, she’d done that by offering to set the gate herself, while she was wearing very little clothing and obviously under the influence of some substance that was probably illegal. He’d politely but rather sarcastically refused, thankfully May was vastly entertained by the whole situation and kept laughing uncontrollably every time she looked at him until JJ finally came over, shoved her out of the way, pointed to her in irritation and identified her as the Gate Tech.



Walker still hadn’t really believed her. May had spun over, grabbed his hand, and yanked him to a bonfire somewhere in Ireland. She hadn’t brought him back until he’d helped round up and shear a large flock of sheep the next day. He hadn’t minded working with the sheep, the biggest issues was that he didn’t have proper shoes and kept slipping on the wet grass, but half the folks were still hung over from the night before so it didn’t matter all that much, everybody was falling all over the place, anyway.



May had leaned on the fence and watched them, she was the only one who didn’t seem to be doing any work but nobody seemed to mind. They all obviously knew her, Walker couldn’t tell if it was where May was from or not because she didn’t use a translator and was talking just like them, but he wasn’t familiar enough with the dialect to know if she’d have an ‘accent’ or not.



The farmers singled out some sheep and put them in a smaller pen while the others got tossed back into the large field. When they finished, May ambled over to look at the group of sheep.



“Ewe, ewe, and...ewe.” May pointed, the three sheep moved away from the group. “Baaaa, Raaaam, Eeeewe!” She clapped her hands and then waved her fingers at the sheep. Another three animals appeared, they look exactly like the ones standing there already. “Dolly!” May said. The sheep multiplied again, there were twenty of them now, the new ones had a full coat of wool. “Sweet, now...You!” May jabbed a finger at another sheep. “C’mere, I like the look of you. Rose Bush Shaun the Sheep!” May clapped and waved her fingers again.



“Baah?” The sheep asked.



“Yeh, those are your ladies.” May said “Keep them out of trouble, yeah?”



“Baah.” The sheep nodded.



“Tommy! Come get yo wool factory!” May screamed, making Walker jump.



A young man had ambled over, looked at the sheep, then over at May. “Seriously?”



“Do it yourself then.” May said.



“He’s gonna get into everything.” Tommy said.



“Of course he is.” May grinned. “Oh, come on! You love that show!”



“When I was five!” Tommy protested.



“Well, you can relive your childhood, then.” May had said. “I do it all the time, it’s brilliant.”



Tommy had looked over at Walker and shaken his head. “Can you believe her?”



“No.” Walker had said flatly.



“Mom.” Tommy had rolled his eyes. “He’s some poor dope from ISTC, isn’t he. Sorry about this, man, she thinks it’s funny.”



“It is.” May had said. “And he’s not some ISTC dope, he just ain’t figured out these folks worship in the Temple of the Trees.”



Walker froze, then slowly looked around. He hadn’t seen it before because he hadn’t been looking for it, he’d stopped looking for it because if you look, you’ll see it, even when it isn’t there. That’s part of what it does, how it hides itself, it creates an illusion of being there, so you’ll think the reality is an illusion as well when you come across it.



The dogs, little black and white border collies, he’d thought they must all be related because they looked similar. There were half a dozen just sitting around the yard by then, though, and looking at them Walker realized they didn’t look similar, they looked exactly the same. The only difference between dogs was the amount and placement of dirt, grass, and sheep manure adhered to their fur. He looked up, over at the dogs that were still out moving around. They were dividing the sheep up, moving them into different pens, but no people were paying any attention. They dogs were doing it all completely by themselves. Walker thought that was probably possible, if they did the same thing each time the dogs could probably do it without supervision. It’s always going to be in the realm of possibility, though, it’s just going to be somewhere far out on the end.



The door of the barn had some sort of decoration painted on it, he’d actually looked at it then and realized it wasn’t a flower as he’d first thought, it was a Knot, a constant spell that shifted probability slightly in the favor of whatever living things were inside. They were on all the other buildings, too, either painted on or sewn into the curtains or hanging as flags. He saw some quilts with Knots on them hanging on a line to dry.



The pen the sheep had been moved into was sitting inside of a low wall- a circle of stone. He stared at it for several seconds, then lifted his hand and snapped his fingers. The circle flashed, a line of ghost flame raced around then went out, an indication the circle was set to receive instructions automatically from anyone.



May had been practically dancing in place as she watched him look around, Tommy looked like he was about to experience an eyeroll induced medical emergency.



“Why do you do this?” Tommy asked.



“Look at him!” May waved a hand at Walker.



“Yeah, yeah, I see.” Tommy said. “You found a witch, good job.”



May cackled. “Who do Voodoo?”



Walker had stared at her for a very long time, trying to figure out exactly what to say. The little ram May had done...whatever...to had gotten hold of a fiddle and started to play, May and the dogs all started dancing.



“Oh, for fuck sake.” Tommy had groaned. “Sorry about this, man, she’s so fucking weird. Wizard of Oz that shit, she’ll take you back.”



“Wizard…” Walker had started to ask, but Tommy had walked away. Of course he had, he wouldn’t be that much more forthcoming than his mother in a situation like this.



Walker went and sat down on a stump in the barnyard, looking at the activity around him. He was seeing it all over now, the way the people moved and did things, the way they’d snap or wave at objects and get a response, the way they just talked to the animals like they were other people. This is literally a magical area, a place where it permeates everything so deeply that it takes very little power or skill to touch and manipulate it.



“Baaa?” The little ram had come over.



“I need to get back to the station.” Walker said.



“Baaa.” The ram motioned toward May with his head.



“Yeah, but...I don’t think she’ll take me back if I just say ‘take me back’, things don’t work that way with people like her. I think I insulted her.” Walker says. “I didn’t realize who she was.”



“Baah.” The ram waved the statement away. “Baa baa, baa baa baa baa baa baa *baaaah*.”



“What’s the right way?” Walker asks.



The little sheep stands up on his hind legs, clears his throat, then clicks his little rear hooves together three times. “Baa baa baa baa baa.”



“What?” Walker laughed.



“Baah.” The sheep nodded. “Baa baa baa baabaa.”



Walker had sighed, stood up, and feeling very silly, clicked his heels together three times. “There’s no place like home.”



There had been a very brief feeling of something blowing in his face, making him blink, and then he was standing on something hard and the world had gone dark. Not actually dark, though, it just took a second for his eyes to adjust from the bright outdoor sunlight to the dim interior of his quarters on the Karakachan. May was standing beside him, she had one of the border collies in her arms. She dropped the dog, which had immediately gotten into his bunk and rolled until most of the muck had been deposited on his bedding.



May hasn’t gotten much easier to deal with since then. Things had gotten a little better when he realized the best way to get her to actually do anything was to just demand she stop fucking around and get on with it.



The window in the pot bellied stove lights up yellow as it begins to emit heat. There isn’t an actual flame in there, just flora, the color is aesthetic. Something under the house, or maybe in the walls, rumbles softly, and the windows steam up then almost immediately begin to frost over. Walker looks through the quickly diminishing circle of clear glass that is the kitchen window. The pasture is empty, blanketed in thick snow, chimneys on either side of the barn are sending out plumes of either steam or smoke. 

  


A black dot emerges from the snowy sky, swoops down across the pasture and vanishes onto the porch. A few seconds later, Justin hops in through the doggie door and shakes snow from his feathers. 

  


“Do you have my change?” JJ asks. 

  


Justin has a small object in his mouth, he puts it down between his feet to talk. “I had to take the bus.” 

  


“You have wings.” JJ says. 

  


“I got tired.” Justin picks the object up again, flies over to the table and lands on JJ’s plate. She makes a face and pushes the plate and bird away, then holds out her hand. Justin drops the object into it and begins pecking at her scrambled eggs. 

  


Walker comes over to look, Justin has given JJ a ring, just a simple band with what might be a decoration or inscription in some language he doesn’t recognize, sized for a human male. JJ turns it over several times in her hand, frowning slightly. 

  


“That doesn’t look like Kelsey’s style.” Walker says. “Does it mean anything to you?” 

  


JJ shakes her head slowly. “It sure as hell means something to May. She used to keep it around her neck, way back when.” 

  


“You think she lost it?” Walker asks. 

  


“Maybe.” JJ says. “Or maybe she left it somewhere.” 

  


“At a marine animal park?” Walker asks. “I suppose if she was swimming around…” 

  


“Justin, where did you get this?” JJ asks. 

  


“Bought it off the Jackdaw.” Justin says. 

  


“Who does the Jackdaw work for?” Walker asks. 

  


“I think…” JJ says slowly. “It’s the same person that May with that ring doth wed.”



“Is she married?” Walker asks.



“Oh, the man gave her that ring, he stepped over a long, long time ago.” JJ says.



“Sometimes, they come back.” Walker says.



“Sometimes, they never leave.” JJ says.

May takes several steps back from the control center, puts her hand to her face as she contemplates something. She triggers her onboard radio. “Rahal, will you come down to the lift building please? And bring Diesel if she’s available.” 

  


Rahal jumps when her radio goes off, then laughs sheepishly. “Boss wants us. May, I mean.” 

  


Diesel snorts. “Do you always call her that?” 

  


“I guess.” Rahal shrugs. “I mean, she is.” 

  


As they walk down the now enclosed hall to the lift building, Diesel slows down and narrows her eyes. She can hear the flora here humming, it’s pulling a ton of power, but there’s something else, too. It’s a sound that’s not a sound, coming right into her head, one she’s heard before but not this loud. This sounds like music, the kind that makes you start to move with the beat without realizing it. 

  


There’s a floral door at the end. When they approach, the flora pulls back, it should reveal whatever is inside the old lift building, but it doesn’t. There’s a round door that spins, pieces slot into place, then it withdraws like an iris into the wall. 

  


“Holy shit.” Diesel says. 

  


“Woah. What is that?” Rahal hesitates, but May motions them in. 

  


“Hugo.” May says. “Well, part of Hugo. We’re about to do a little…renovating. Now, lets see if that damn crow did his job…Hugo, test point one. Test point two. Third times the charm…oh yeah, now we’re cookin with gas.” May claps her hands. “Signal test, jack that shit!” 

  


The display flickers, someone wearing a rubber mask of a man with blonde hair and sunglasses against a moving background of black and white stripes, apparently mocking the camera. It vanishes after a moment and is replaced by some sort of complicated graphic that seems to be mapping something in multiple dimensions. 

  


“Alright, let's see what we got here. Lock it down, Hugo!” 

  


The graphic changes, there are now several more or less direct lines taking different routes between two more brightly glowing dots. May waves at the display and the figure rotates in different directions. 

  


“What do you think?” May asks. 

  


“Not a fan of this one.” Nothing points. “That area is scheduled for reclamation.” 

  


“Right then. Let’s see…Blind mice up the clock…There we go, that’s right by Oakleaf Plaza.” May glances over at Rahal and Diesel. “Works better if I know where we’re going.” 

  


“Are we going to move?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Hugo cannot move Hugo. And you ‘bout to see what we’re gonna do. Alright, here goes Nothing.” May steps back, points at the control console. “Let’s blow this pop stand!” 

  


Halfway across the planet, the house that had most recently been occupied by Adrian Kelsey collects snow. A plume of smoke drifts lazily from the chimney, the windows glow yellow, the front walk is conspicuously clear. Inside, the grandfather clock, which had started ticking away again nearly an hour ago, begins to strike thirteen. 

  


The display screen drops down below the console, leaving a flat surface. Nothing shimmers into existence above the controls, from the waist up and several times larger than she had appeared before. She lifts her arms, morphs into a complicated flowerlike figure that expands, curls down over the walls. 

  


“Aaaand…runaway!” May claps her hands loudly, making Diesel and Rahal jump. 

  


There is the extremely uncomfortable feeling of the universe being flapped like a bedsheet, followed by the distinct impression that sections of reality have abruptly moved slightly in one direction or another. Then they are plunged into darkness, or what seems like darkness in comparison to the light show they’d been standing in. 

  


When their eyes adjust, Rahal and Diesel realize they’re standing in a very old-style house, wood on the floor, paper on the walls, rugs with complicated designs. It’s not really a period repro, though, just an old house, there’s some stuff here that is absolutely modern. 

  


May makes an angry noise. “Holy shit, seriously!” 

  


Dusty laughs. “Looks like you got a pest infection.” 

  


“Who the fuck left all my books out!” May throws her hands in the air. “And…is this cake? Children! Literal goddamn children! Look! Look at the mess you made!” 

  


May jabs a finger at Rahal, who steps back. “Me? I’ve never even been here before.” 

  


“Not you, you, you…” May makes a frustrated motion. 

  


“Filthy little lemurs?” Rahal suggests. 

  


May snaps her fingers and points at her. “See, she gets it.” 

  


Diesel walks over and looks through a window, she can’t see anything except a ring of trees covered in snow. “Where are we?” 

  


“Should be West Sunset, couple miles from JJ’s.” May says. 

  


“We’re in Hangdog?” Rahal says. 

  


“Yeah.” May says. “I told you, Hugo isn’t a ship. Hugo is a semi-portable stable gate array system.” 

  


“Ok, ok, so…this is your house, right?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Damn straight it is, little shit pulling shenanigans. Steal my house will you…” May grumbles angrily. “Ooh, I hope they’re around, I am *just* in the mood.” 

  


“This might sound like a stupid question but…how do we get back? To Factory Road, I mean.” Rahal says. 

  


“Not a stupid question at all.” May says. “Come hither.” 

  


They follow her to a door with a sign taped to it requesting people not kick it. Rahal arches an eyebrow, May opens the door. Steps lead down to a basement that obviously serves as a sitting area, there are couches and chairs and a very old looking TV. May opens another door, bright light pours out. It’s the control room inside what had been the old lift building. 

  


“You just step over.” Rahal says weakly. 

  


“Yep.” May says. 



\---

  
  


“Sweet baby Jesus!” JJ yelps as her coffee sloshes. “Every goddamn time, I swear she knows when I have a souffle in the oven!” 

  


“Fucking hell!” Walker snarls as his card castle is reduced to a pile of rubble. 

  


The phone rings. JJ looks over and rolls her eyes, she shouldn’t have an ancient yellow landline phone but there it is. Of course it’s one that weighs twenty pounds, couldn’t send a slimline cordless or something. 

  


“What.” JJ says into the receiver. “What? No! I don’t care where you are, do you have any idea…I know, it’s three feet- No they don’t have cleats!” 

  


Walker groans. “What is wrong with her, seriously. Give me the phone. May. May! Yes, yes, good to hear you, too, look…Where? Alright, I understand but…Yes, I’m sorry, I know we should have cleaned it up.” Walker sighs and holds the receiver away from his ear, May is ranting about the library. “There aren’t any ants here! Well, how would a roach…why would it ride in on my clothes! Why can’t JJ have roaches!” 

  


“I do not have roaches.” JJ says. 

  


“Neither do I. Neither does May.” Walker says. “Alright, alright, my deepest apologies. That  doesn’t help the fact that the roads are nigh impassable at the moment. Yes, yes, I suppose you do. Alright. See you in a bit.” 

  


Walker hangs up the phone and puts a hand over his face, draws it slowly down. “She’s coming over here.” 



May hangs up the phone, which is yellow plastic and shaped like a banana. “Alright, I guess I’m gonna go over there. Y’all don’t mess my shit up. JJ’s Kids!” May claps her hands loudly and vanishes into thin air.

  


Rahal and Diesel both jump, Dusty doesn’t seem surprised. There are voices from the basement, a second later Vincent appears loudly telling someone, probably Benni, that it’s totally fine. 

  


\---

Benni yelps as the building seems to shift a few inches, looks around expecting something else to happen and jumps when a ball rolls off of a shelf and bounces on the floor. She goes out to find Vincent, Mac, and Rick standing in the lobby, looking around. 

  


“Did you guys feel that?” Benni asks. 

  


“That’s Hugo, isn’t it?” Mac asks. 

  


“Yeah.” Vincent says. 

  


“Who’s Hugo?” Benni asks. 

  


“Come on.” Rick waves at her. 

  


The door at the end of the hall into what used to be the lift building ends in an ornate round door. It rotates open as they approach, apparently not concerned about security, or maybe programmed to let them in. 

  


“Oh, wow.” Benni hesitates, but the guys walk right in so she follows them. “This is the gate array control system, isn’t it.” 

  


“Yep.” Vincent says. “She’s a pro, I’m telling you. That little wrinkle we just felt? That was a gate going in. There’s only one other door in here, so that’s gonna be it.” 

  


“Oh, it’s nice in here.” Vincent says. 

  


“Yeah, I think this is the House that Jack Built.” Dusty says. 

  


“Which is…” Rahal prompts. 

  


“It’s the body, Hugo is the engine.” Dusty says.

  


“Sorry?” Rahal asks.

  


“It’s the hull of the ship.” Dusty says. “If it was a ship. It’s the outside that Hugo is inside, all the other shit either is in here or connects to it.”

  


“Is there...more of it? Like, underground?” Rahal asks.

  


“It’s a tesseract.” Dusty says.

  


“Oh.” Rahal says. “Oh, of course they can do that, duh. Are all of them this...weird...about it?”

  


“I dunno, the only other one’s I’ve really talked to are her kin, and they’re certainly birds of a feather.” Dusty laughs. “She does like messing with people, though, and Nothing just eggs her on. She probably figured you weren’t enough of a sucker for that, though.”

  


“She talked to me one time.” Rahal says. “May was asleep.”

  


“Yeah, she’ll sit over her sometimes. I don’t think May knows. She’s worried about her, I guess, or maybe she just likes looking at her and can’t do it when she’s out running around or folks will see her.” Dusty says.

  


“That’s really sweet.” Rahal says.

  


“Yeah, she generally is.” Dusty says. “She’ll get nasty real quick if she thinks you have bad intentions, though. She does not trust humans, it takes awhile for May to convince her somebody is actually OK.”

  


“Oh.” Rahal says. “Oh, is that why it took so long for her to actually start talking to me?”

  


“Probably.” Dusty says. “See, you are special. Nothing likes you, a lot. Enough to let May put her life in your hands out there. She trusts Walker and JJ, she loves Jim but she knew who he was already. She likes Jack because he took it upon himself to fish May out of some serious shit and they’d both be dead otherwise.”

  


Rahal walks over and begins looking at the books. They look very, very old, but when she opens them, she can read the text. A bunch of them are obviously fiction books, she starts sorting them into piles. 

  


Then she picks up one and flips it open, and stops. She recognizes the stuff inside, well, she can see it’s familiar, just using slightly different arrangements and sequences, different abbreviations, but…she knows this. 

  


“What are these?” Rahal looks around. 

  


Diesel looks over her shoulder, takes the book. “Ooh, Arch. It shows you how to program a computer. Like, a real one, the ones humans use.” 

  


“It’s code.” Rahal says. 

  


“Yeah. Here, this is another one, it’ll tell you the operating system usually in the title or front page, and the version…here, see, Linux, Unix, MS DOS…” Diesel flips through the pile. “That’s cool.” 

  


“Why would May have these?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Maybe she has to program her…whatever.” Diesel shrugs. “Or maybe, I mean if she sits around in places for a long time, like, you had to do all this yourself when humans first started using computers. Like, program it all by yourself.” 

  


“That seems…time consuming.” Rahal says. 

  


“Yeah, most people didn’t do it and it got to where they could just do stuff by themselves, I mean, through a visual interface. Like you can just ask the system on Falcron for something, you don’t have to, like, program in the way to do it.” Diesel says. 

  


“You can, though.” Rahal says. “You can tell it specifically how you want it to do things, you just have to input the codes directly. Look, there’s even a ‘make’ command!” 

  


“Build and Grow will do stuff outside Hugo.” Dusty says. 

  


“Dad!” Diesel barks. 

  


“What?” Dusty lifts his hands. “I’m just the messenger, I don’t do that hacker shit.” 

  


“So, you understand this?” Benni asks. 

  


Rahal shrugs. “Kinda. I mean, I see how it works, it just calls things different names. I think this is…this is “fetch” from…somewhere…this one makes, like, a container you can put stuff in- like, data- this one…let me see…this is to make like a machine sort of, like, to make something that does something it couldn’t do before…oh, this is asking it to search for a signal from any other ones nearby…” 

  


Rahal turns around slowly, looking at the room. There is one thing that seems very out of place, an incredibly ugly painting of a cow wearing a pink hat. 

  


“Launch Terminal.” Rahal says. 

  


She has a moment where she thinks she’s going to look like an idiot, but the cow vanishes and is replaced with a black screen with a flashing cursor. 

  


“Launch Visual Audio Interface.” Rahal says. The screen stays black, apparently it didn’t accept that input. “Launch Hugo.” Still a black screen. 

  


Dusty puts a hand on her shoulder, smiles. “Hugo! Wake the fuck up!” 

  


The screen flashes, comes up with a background of fish swimming in a stone lined pond. 

  


“Where am I?” Mac asks. 

  


Two maps appear. One shows the surface of Rycacia, one shows what looks like the blueprints for a building. The one of the surface indicates they are in Hangdog City, it zooms in to show they are off of West Sunset, which is a few miles from JJs farm. The other seems to be the house they are in now, it labels the upstairs as ‘bedrooms’ and the downstairs as ‘kitchen’, ‘library’, etc. There is a door in the basement that has a thin line connecting it to a room labeled ‘Factory’, which is a different color than the rest. 

  


“It’s only connected to one other place right now.” Dusty says. “That’s the lift building there.” 

  




\---

JJ is walking toward the trash can, loudly bemoaning the loss of her souffle, when she runs smack into May. JJ screams, half in surprise and half in anger, steps back and looks at the mess down her front. 

  


“I cannot believe you!” JJ shoves the dish into May’s hands, pushes past her and stalks away to change clothes. 

  


“Really, the trick is not to open the oven, you know.” May puts the dish down on the counter and looks at Walker, who is giving her an exasperated look. “Hey, man, how you been?” 

  


“Hi.” Walker says, after deciding not to say what he really wants to. “Fine, how are you.” 

  


“Oh, just peachy.” May says. “Look at this snow, that’s really something, huh. Damn, it’s cold in here, too! You know, you can get blown-in insulation for really-” 

  


“You’ve seen the house, then?” Walker says. 

  


“Huh, oh, yeah.” May waves a hand. 

  


“And?” Walker says. 

  


“And?” May says. 

  


“Look, is it a…something?” Walker makes a complicated and apparently meaningless hand gesture. 

  


“Everything is something, Walker.” May pours a cup of coffee and sits down at the table across from him. 

  


“Do we need to worry about it?” Walker says. 

  


“The house? Why would  you worry about it? It’s in great shape, not, like, a hazard if kids get up in there or something.” May says. 

  


“Why? Oh, come on, it’s not…it wasn’t…that is Adrian Kelsey’s house!” Walker snaps. 

  


“No it’s not, little chicken shit.” May says. “That house is going back to it’s rightful owner, thankyouverymuch.” 

  


“Ok, good, so you’re going to take it with you then.” Walker says. 

  


“Ooh, I dunno about that.” May says. “It’ll be OK, though, don’t worry about it.” 

  


“Fine, thank you, I suppose-” Walker says. 

  


“You might have to worry about Kelsey and Penny, though.” May says casually. 

  


“Oh, lord, I knew it.” JJ is coming down the stairs in clean clothes. 

  


“Yeah, they’re totally around somewhere. I betcha they got some bullshit up at Fern Hill, that seems fucking thematic for a couple wackadoos.” May says. 

  


“Well, they must be hiding pretty good.” JJ pulls something out of her pocket and gives it to May. “Here ya go, baby.” 

  


“Thank you, sweetie.” May takes the ring and sticks it under her shirt, presumably into her bra. “They probably wanted to try and force install one of the controllers into the House that Jack Built. That ain’t gonna work anyway, they didn’t bring it here, they got brought cause they were inside the damn thing.” 

  


“I suppose that really would be the only place they could go undetected.” JJ says. “That seems…that place is infested, though.” 

  


“Well, what are a few more fucking pests. She’s probably the goddamn Queen of the Gremlins.” May says. “Ok, I ain’t goin up there in this weather.” 

  


“I’ll get the chalk.” JJ sighs. 

  


Walker watches as JJ pushes a rug aside and draws a circle on the floor, makes markings around the outside. She arranges items, does some sort of complicated looking ritual, then steps back. May looks from JJ to Walker and back. She starts doing her little bouncy dance, apparently powering up. 

  


“Three...Two...One...Contact!” May stamps her foot loudly on the chalk outline, the china on the shelves rattles and JJ winces.

  


The outline lights up, briefly becomes a column of light, then condense into an empty door frame standing in the middle of the room. 

  


“I keep telling you, do them against a wall.” May says. 

  


“I can’t do a full circle with a wall there!” JJ says. 

  


“So bend it! It’s a chalk outline!” May says. 

  


“No, it isn’t! It’s a space-time barrier and it has to be-” JJ protests. 

  


“But it’s not flat anyway, right? It’s not freaking two dimensional, why does the outline matter that much?” May waves her hands. 

  


“It just does!” JJ says. 

  


“Ladies!” Walker says loudly. 

  


In the living room of the House that Jack Built, the display changes. This time it generates a point, the graphic is a circle. It has a label above it, “Th-x-T temp sub-d-8”. The whole thing grays out after a few seconds and “inactive” appears above it. 

  


“What does that label mean?” Rahal asks. 

  


“It’s a magic circle.” May says from behind her, making her jump. 

  


May is standing there, along with two other people. Rahal recognizes one of them as Walker, she assumes the other one must be this JJ person. 

  


“It’s a Thaumaturgical Gate.” Walker says. 

  


“Same thing.” May says. 

  


Walker rolls his eyes. JJ has started talking to Mac and Rick, it sounds like she’s giving them some jucy gossip by the way they keep laughing and shaking their heads. 

  


“You give me a door.” JJ says. “I’m not doing that again.” 

  


May pulls open a drawer and takes out a piece of chalk. She looks at JJ pointedly, waves at them to follow her. She stops at the end of the downstairs hall and makes a pushing motion. The hall gets longer, the door at the end shrinking like a trick shot in a movie. She gives JJ another look, draws a square on the wall with the chalk. 

  


“Oh, for the love of…” Walker groans. 

  


May draws hinges and a door knob on the rectangle, steps back, gives JJ another look. “Beetlejuice…Beetlejuice…*Beetlejuice*!” She smacks the wall, which is now a door, hard with the flat of her hand. 

  


“There, there’s your door. See? On the fucking wall.” May says. 

  


“Can you please explain to her-” JJ says. 

  


“I’ve tried.” Walker says. “Believe me.” 

  


“Well, now we’re all here, let’s have a little party!” May says. “Hey, guys, glad you could make it.”



May has abandoned her professional look, and Benni squints at her. May flashes her a grin and winks, Benni shakes her head. May is starting to dance in place again, as though she has some sort of club mix playing in her head.



“Alright, I’m just going to ignore the fact that you clearly just stole this house-” Walker says. 

  


“Nope, nope, no, nuh-huh. My goddamn house.” May says and stomps her foot, the house reacts by beginning to play techno music.

  


“Fine, fine, whatever. Frankly, I don’t care. But we do need to find Kelsey and Penny.” Walker rolls his eyes as the music increases in volume.

  


“Yep. We needs some eyes in the sky is what we needs.” May says. “Hey, Baby-D, you wanna grab your drones? We can pair them up here, but for now I think…Hugo! Dark Half!” 



The beat drops and here is an eruption of tiny, high pitched sounds that become recognizable as birds chirping. May motions toward a window, the sky and yard are full of little moving dark things flitting about in the snow. Birds, hundreds of them, small brown ones. May has started dancing around.

  


“Sparrows.” May says, making fluttery motions with her hands. “They’re good for a slow sweep, thorough as hell but it’ll take awhile for them to work their way over that far.”

Despite now having all the power ups needed to get everything here, it doesn’t feel as satisfying when revisiting old areas in previous games and I’m having a hard time pinning down why. At least we now have a robot friend. I love robot friends in media. I trust sentient robots more than people these days.



(No, that doesn’t mean I ChatGDP and [character.ai](http://character.ai) , Generative AI is not alive, will never be alive, and is DEFINETLY NOT your friend!)



The only other thing to talk about tonight is something that has been nagging me ever since I entered Flare Pool, and that’s how the writing quality of the scan logs is significantly worse than the previous Metroid Prime games. 



It was something I noticed back in Ice Belt where the majority of the scan logs were just different ways of explaining why the computers were broken, and in Flare Pool not only has that quality not gotten better, but there’s even less meaningful things to scan now.



Another commenter from a previous post perfectly described the scan logs as “never exceeding a sixth grade reading level” and it's such a bummer because scanning was one of the best parts about the original Prime trilogy. What made scanning so fun was that you were slowly learning about the world and the setting as you went along. 



You were learning all the different creatures and how their unique anatomy interacted with the ecosystem,You were learning about the history of the chozo and the culture and how they viewed the world, You even learned a lot about the space pirates and how they lived their day-to-day lives, such as getting little tidbits about how pirates would try to sneak in pets into the workplace and how they saw Samus as a terrifying force of nature! 



It made the world feel alive, and you just don't get that sense with Viewros because we've been to 5 facilities built by the Lamorn, yet I still know nothing about them. I don't know anything about their culture, I don’t know their values or beliefs,and outside the great tragedy I barely know anything about their history other than they had a machine age and a psychic age (which also means nothing cuz I keep seeing instances of technology of the two eras in the same areas so I have no sense of how far apart these eras are.)



The only thing I do know about these people is that they must have been a culture of absolute motorheads because that factory on Volt Forge was producing hundreds, if not thousands of motor cycles per minute! You don't make a factory of that production capacity unless you're shipping to every single person on the planet, if not to the surrounding planets! It's really funny yet endearing looking at these four armed axolotl aliens and imagining them at a cars and coffee or roving around in motorcycle gangs in an effort to ward off their mid-life crises. . 



At least it’s SOMETHING that makes them feel more human, but again- outside of Volt Forge we get absolutely no other indications of their fascination with vehicles. We don't find a huge pile of motorcycles out in the middle of the desert, and then right next to it find a motorcycle dealership half buried in the sand. We don't see any large pieces of highway structure jutting out from the dunes, we don't see signs poking out from the sands that indicate speed limits or directions to nearby cities or towns that have been otherwise erased from history. 



These are things that not only would have added a lot more variety to the desert, but also have done so much world building into fleshing out what this culture was. The Lamorn have so much potential to offer extremely fascinating world building, because they are a society of psychics. What would civilization built around a population of psychics even look like? 



Y'all know how in Morrowind the only way to enter the mage’s guild was to know levitation so you can float into the mushroom houses because they didn't have stairs? That was the kind of architecture I was hoping to see more of in the level design, but we don't really get any sense of how these people lived, unlike Prime One, where at least the rooms in the Chozo ruins were named after structures and facilities that people would have used on a daily basis. 



As a creator, I don't always want to assume the low quality of a product was a result of a lack of talent, because you’d think these people would have gotten their jobs based on SOME kind of merit- but I really think we've taken for granted what absolute mad lads Retro’s original writing were. 



Those crazy bastards wrote a 100-page story outline for the first draft of the game that would eventually morph into Metroid Prime. On the second draft they somehow DOUBLED that page count just for the story alone! These were people who took world building seriously, that level of detail and dedication is something  that you can’t just copy/paste or imitate convincingly. It's just really frustrating knowing that there’s a D&D campaign out there that has more thought-out world building than this AAA game that took nearly a decade to make.

“Five thousand years.” Vincent says idly, he’s watching the TV again and only partially paying attention. “Ten years minimum if you’re in one of those wacky hyperdrive ship deals the humans do. Probably six months if you use the Marasat gates through there and get everything lined up so you don’t have to go hunting for the entrance or figure out where the fuck you are. T-gate…like, five minutes?” 

  


“Ten, that one is slow as balls.” May says. “Most of the time you spent on that ship was just getting it to and from the gate itself. To get from one side of the civilized universe and not arrive thousands, millions, of years away from where you left, you have to remove either time or distance from the equation somehow. You know that, it’s just so normalized you don’t think about it. You know logically these planets are, just, so far away from each other it’s mind blowing, you know that we can somehow just zip back and forth between them in days or weeks or months. You’ve been through basic crew training, you’ve got a vague idea of how the engine on whatever ship you were on worked, right?” 

  


“Yeah.” Rahal says. “Sort of.”

  


“That’s fine, I’m just using it to make a point. Were they using the Phinnagian IV? They love that damn thing.” May says, when Rahal nods she goes on. “Alright- Vincent, make yourself useful.” 

  


“Huh? Oh, um…Cruiser Class, Light Speed Max.” Vincent says. 

  


“Can you put it through a mechanical gate?” May asks. 

  


“Shit, no.” Vincent says. “You wanna get shredded?” 

  


“Can you put an FTL engine in one?” May asks. 

  


“Can’t handle the stress.” Vincent says. “You’d have to alter the whole front end and reinforce the rest of it.” 

  


“Flora it.” Mac says. 

  


“Well, yeah, here.” Vincent waves. “Could you imagine a bunch of little human worm babies doing that?” 

  


“They tried.” May says. “Didn’t work out for them so well. So, we have established there is literally no way for that ship to have gotten from there to here in that amount of time with your tech or the Marasat tech.” 

  


“Alright, fine, so we use gates from…whatever you are.” Rahal says. 

  


“Teleforathian.” May says. “Yes.” 

  


“OK.” Rahal says. “And…” 

  


“And they work differently.” May says. “Which is why you can put whatever you want right through them. You can walk through one and not even know it.” 

  


“Boss, this stuff is kinda beyond me.” Rahal says. 

  


“Ok, Ok.” May tugs the bandanna out of Dusty’s pocket and spreads it flat on her lap. “For the sake of examples, pretend this is space-time. The universe. Whatever. It’s where we are. Here.” The fabric has a pattern printed on it, and she points to one of the markings. “We want to be here.” She indicates another marking on the other side.

  


“Right.” Rahal says. 

  


“Humans, you just go- zoom, right across the top.” May moves her finger quickly along.

  


“OK.” Rahal says. 

  


“Marasats kind of…” May wads the fabric and pinches it at the top, “bunch everything up and then go straight through, put in a dart to keep it in place. You go faster, but you go through everything to get there and it’s a lot harder to judge how close you are to where you want to be.”

  


“Alright.” Rahal says. 

  


“What we do is-” May pinches the points again, brings them together. “Is step over.” 

  


“But…but to do that, you’d have to…get off of it. You can’t get off of it, you can’t just step over.” Rahal says. “You have to go along or through.” 

  


“Why?” May asks. 

  


“Because that’s just the way it is!” Rahal says. 

  


“No, it isn’t.” May says, then abruptly starts singing. “Take me to the river, river, throw me in the water, water…” 

  


That ends the conversation, which disappoints Rahal slightly, but she does enjoy listening to them sing. And it gives her a chance to sit here and watch them, and think, and not have it feel weird. 

  


Rahal isn’t surprised May isn’t human, she’d given her a 50/50 chance between that and just being an odd person who doesn’t particularly care for other humans.



Rahal has some other questions, too. Like, why the hell is she, Rahal, even here? Why had Neil sent her a transport ticket and instructions to go catch up with May real quick before she left? Why had May even told him where she was going? She hops on shuttles and leaves all the time without telling anybody, it infuriates him. 

  


She say’s they’re there to look into some sort of ‘scammy shit’ and an ‘abandoned vehicle’, but obviously isn’t in a hurry to do so. She’s not human, she doesn’t seem to care what the humans are doing over there because…well, why would she? What if, Rahal thinks, they called May because it’s a vehicle from someone on her own planet, and she either knows they aren’t a threat or thinks they’ll focus on harassing the humans and doesn’t care. She likes the Rycacians, so the planet probably isn’t in danger or something. 

  


Then, suddenly, new lines begin to connect in her head. A door that leads to another time, a building that’s a different one inside, doors appearing out of nowhere, assets talking to her, her talking to the mainframe that’s not actually a machine…she’s been sitting here for the past few years, not since the station was built like Rahal had assumed, like everybody assumed because she was listed as crew and never taken off…of course she wasn’t, they probably knew she wasn’t dead, just lost, and could pop back up at any time, and she’s been working there because she was staying close and waiting for the right time to…

  


“You!” Rahal shouts suddenly, jabbing a finger at May. 

  


“Don’t you cast at me.” May says. “What do you want?” 

  


“You’re doing this!” Rahal says. 

  


“Doing what?” May asks. 

  


“This shit with the flora.” Rahal says. 

  


“I am?” May looks around. 

  


“Yes! You are!” Rahal says. “I know you can, I’ve seen you do it on Falcron!” 

  


“I have never grown a radio tower on Falcron.” May says. 

  


“But you make doors, and rooms, and chairs, and…” Rahal says. “I know you do, don’t pretend I haven’t seen you.” 

  


“See, she’s not completely useless.” May says. 

  


“And nobody else can talk to the fucking assets and get them to talk back!” Rahal says.



“You can.” May says.



“And those goddamn birds.” Rahal ignores her.

  


“Fucking sky rats.” May says mildly. “They just get into everything, don’t they.” 

  


“You’re like…contracted out with ISTC or something, you don’t really work *for* them. You aren’t actually an employee.” 

  


“Could be.” May says. 

  


“You’re getting paid by the hour to sit here on your ass and pretend you’re investigating something?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Me? No!” May says. “That would be a moral outrage. I charge a flat fee per day, plus travel expenses, and wear and tear, oh, and construction costs…” 

  


“Boss…” Rahal groans. “You know I’m gonna get in serious trouble for this, right?” 

  


“Nah.” May says. “Tell them I kidnapped you.” 

  


“Boss…” Rahal groans again. 

  


“Seriously.” May says. 

  


“Won’t they arrest you?” Rahal says. 

  


May gives her a blank look, points to her own chest. “Not. Human.” 

  


“Won’t they fire you, then?” Rahal asks. 

  


“They do that, they lose their gates. You would not believe the shit they let me get away with.” May waves a hand dismissively.

  


“Ok, are you getting paid to have me with you?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Possibly.” May says. 

  


“This is some assessment bullshit, isn’t it.” Rahal groans.

  


“Why you have to go through all of this complicated-” May yelps and dodges as Rahal throws a pillow at her. 

  


“You seriously came down here acting like something was wrong, got me all worried, and this is just some dumbass thing about what elevators I can use or something?” Rahal collapses back into the chair. 

  


“I mean, it will give you clearance to come down here and muck about by yourself.” May says. “They’re probably gonna try to get you sit over at HDC and play copper. Don’t do it, the weather is horrible.” 

  


“You don’t have to do it like this!” Rahal says. “You can-” 

  


“Continue to be bored off my ass?” May says. “Besides, if we go look at this bullshit in HDC, it’ll log in the ISTC database with you as ‘Constable’ because Computer has decided I’m Madame Poirot, that’ll automatically rank you up to Security 5 on Falcron and they’ll stop deducting rent and shit from your paycheck and put you on G Deck, that is a nice deck to live on, man.” 



“You’re who?” Rahal asks.



“Look it up.” May says, then rolls her eyes at Rahal’s annoyed look. “A detective, Rahal, Computer likes to list me as a detective.”

  


“Oh.” Rahal says. “Thanks?” 

  


“I like you.” May says. 

  


“I’m glad.” Rahal says. 

  


“Isn’t that right over the entertainment sector?” Rick arches an eyebrow. 

  


“Yep.” May says. “There is, in fact, a residence that is incredibly hard to keep occupied because it is right on top of the stage at Club Mango.” 

  


“Sounds noisy.” Vincent says. 

  


“Very.” May says. 

  


“And why would I want to live there?” Rahal asks. 

  


“You wouldn’t.” May says. “Unless the inside is a different place from the outside.” 

  


“What-” Rahal starts. 

  


“I’m tired of paying rent on that stupid station and being harassed by every single creature up there.” May says. “But if I lose the ISTC paycheck, I’ll have to start, like, doing real work again and that sucks.”

  


“You are the laziest fucking person I have ever met.” Rahal says, somewhat awed. 

  


“Thank you.” May says.

  


Something that has quietly been bothering Rahal suddenly clicks into place. A few days ago, in what seems now like a completely different life, she and May had sat in May’s quarters on “Halloween”, talking. A bird had flown in, not one of the pigeons, said birds couldn’t talk, then May had let it out the window and it had flown away. 

  


You can’t “fly off into” a display screen, it’s a screen. It’s a flat surface, if you try to go “through” it just breaks. You can’t step through a display any more than you can step through a TV. It had been showing a view of trees with bright fall foliage, there had been animals in that one, eating from feeders, birds and deer and some smaller furry ones she wasn’t sure about, they looked a little like cats but were eating birdseed. The bird or whatever had flown over the other animals, making some of the other birds scatter, and off into the woods.

  


“Why are you paying rent on an apartment  if your house isn’t even on the station!” Rahal says abruptly. 

  


“I’m not.” May says. “I’m paying rent on the door to an elevator that is perpetually out of service.” 

  


“So, it’s an elevator door that looks like the door to a house, sure, right.” Rahal says. 

  


“Why the hell is a wooden door in a space station? Why is it the only wooden door on that entire deck?” May asks. 

  


“I don’t…” Rahal stops. “Wait, why? That doesn't even make any sense.” 

  


“It doesn’t, does it. You’d think people would notice something like that.” May says. “It’s rather jarring, when you think about it, this big rectangle in the middle of all this…swoop. You know what else is really strange? Nobody ever comes to see me in my quarters, nobody but you. It’s almost like they have no idea it’s there, even though I’m listed in the staff directory. They can just never find it, they can find the one before it, and the one after it, but where is May’s place?” 

  


“But it’s right there.” Rahal says. 

  


“I know.” May says. 

  


“I can see it.” Rahal persists. 

  


“Indeed.” May says. 

  


“Ok, fine, the window in your bedroom really does go…” Rahal says. 

  


“Outside Over There.” May says. 

  


“Explain.” Rahal says. 

  


“Outside over there is wherever the gate exits, or, well, yeah, the gate, that’s good enough.” May says. 

  


“No, not that. Why do you say it like that. Tell me about the phrase ‘outside over there’.” Rahal says. 

  


“And then, Ida made a serious mistake.” May says. “She climbed backwards through the window, into Outside Over There. The goblins stole her sister, you see, and left a babe all made of ice. Ida had to go fetch her back.” 

  


“Memes.” Rahal says, rather quietly. 

  


“Yes, why?” May says. 

  


“That’s…that’s the way you talk, isn’t it. Your native language, it’s one of those where it’s all just like a bunch of references to…” Rahal says. 

  


“That’s not all it is.” May says. 

  


“But that’s part of it.” Rahal says. “And you’ve got some seriously retro accent.” 

  


That gets a burst of laughter from everyone. May shrugs. “I am not learning a bunch of bullshit pop culture for your dumb ass, sorry.” 

  


“They understand it, though.” Rahal says. “These weird history freaks-” 

  


“Hey!” Dusty says. 

  


“Because they watch all that old stuff.” Rahal ignores him. “Hang on…Hang on! Those birds, the ones you talk to all the time, they talk exactly the same way.” 

  


“Fancy that.” May says. “Hey, has anybody seen a weather report for HDC?” 

  


“It’s supposed to start snowing sometime tomorrow.” Vincent says. 

  


“Beautiful, perfect.” May says. 

  


“For how long?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Days, weeks, who knows, not Windows.” Vincent says. 

  


“It’s gotta go for, what, three days minimum for them to spore out?” May asks. 

  


“Yeah, might be longer, I don’t know which one is going. If it’s Big Red, it could be weeks.” 

  


“Awesome.” May says. “You getting a TV signal from that thing yet?” 

  


Diesel pokes at a control panel, shakes her head. “Nah, it’s just broadcasting AM/FM.” 

  


“Not bad. Do we have overlapping ranges yet?” May asks. 

  


“Some.” Diesel says. “It’s spotty.” 

  


“Yeah, that’s not worth it. I wanna wait until we’re getting the visual broadcast, anyway.” May says. 

  


“Why?” Rahal asks. 

  


“I’m setting up a network of gates.” May says. “They’re gonna be tied with the system, they’ll stay on and stable as long as it’s broadcasting. We’ll turn around on this side and jack the signal, follow it right back.” 

  


“To…get to Hangdog?” Rahal says. 

  


“The weather is terrible.” May says. “I’m gonna set the gate on that end inside so-” 

  


“This is all so you don’t get wet!” Rahal shouts. 

  


“And cold, it’s gonna snow.” May says. 

  


“You are…you are…” Rahal says. 

  


“Warm and dry.” May says. “And I intend to stay that way.” 

  


Rahal gets up slowly and walks out of the room. May watches her leave, a slightly amused smile on her face. 

  


“Is she OK?” Vincent asks. 

  


“Oh, I’m sure she is.” May laughs. “She’s pretty good at adjusting her view of reality, it just takes a minute for it to kick in.” 

  


“She’s cute.” Mac says. 

  


“Yeah, she is. You know, she never learned how to sing?” May shakes her head. 

  


“Yeah, most of them don’t, now.” Dusty says. 

  


“What?” May says. “That’s ridiculous, why?” 

  


“They’re all convinced it’s some special thing, I guess. I dunno.” Dusty shrugs. 

  


“Well, shit.” May says. 

  


“You gotta train your lemur.” Dusty says. 

  


“Looks like it.” May says. “Ah well.” 

  


Rahal comes back in, she’s changed into civilian clothing and has her hair down. She motions Rick to move over and flops down on the couch next to him. 

  


“Hello!” May says. “Who’s this stranger I see before me!” 

  


“I’m off duty until you decide to do your job.” Rahal says, then turns to Rick. “Hey, you know Mallory, used to work down at Mango? Yeah, he got fired the other day, he was the one letting everybody in the back.” 

  


“Shocking.” Rick says. “Did you ever find out who that goat belonged to?”

  


“It stole a shuttle, so, no.” Rahal says. 

  


“Hey, D, can you get Z-TV here?” May asks. 

  


“Yeah, which channel you want?” Diesel pulls out a control pad and starts poking at it. 

  


“Drop It Like It’s Hot.” May says. 

  


The screen comes up with flashing lights and pulsing music. Someone is singing very quickly in English.  

  


“Get your ass up.” May grabs Rahal’s hands. 

  


“May…” Rahal says. 

  


“Oh my God, she knows my name!” May gasps. “Get up.” 

  


“Boss…I can’t-” Rahal says. 

  


“Aaand she forgot it again.” May says. “This is club dance, it’s super easy. Come on. Ok, here, just bounce on one leg. That’s it. Right? Yeah, now the other one…and back and forth…step forward…back…right….left…now two steps... Put your hands up. Way up! Not so high up…left…right…You’re a pony! You’re a pony!” May starts skipping.  

  


“I feel stupid.” Rahal says. 

  


“Yep.” May says. “Hey, check this out, y’all, come up here.” 

  


The Rycacians get up and arrange themselves. May starts a pattern of movements again, calling them out. The group are all standing there, watching her, looking slightly amused. She makes eye contact with Rahal, lifts her hand and counts down with her fingers. The Rycacians pick up the movements, and when they're all doing the same motions in sync, it looks like the performances on Falcron. Diesel grabs Rahal’s waist and tugs her back and forth until she starts moving with the beat again. The music changes and they stop the coordinated movements. Dusty grabs May, spins her around and they start dancing together. 

  


“How do they know where to go?” Rahal asks. 

  


“He’s leading. It’s just a quickstep, they’re bein’ all fancy but it’s easy.” Diesel says. “Here, I’ll show you. Gimmie your hand…”



\---

  


“What is that!” Walker spins the volume all the way down. 

  


“Sounds like a club mix of Avicii.” JJ says. “Oh, good, she is actually coming.” 

  


“Oh, for the love of…” Walker says. “Can’t she ever just be normal?” 

  


“I think she’s a little gun shy, particularly with the Controller about to go and throw shit everywhere.” JJ says. “On the good side, it probably means this isn’t an emergent situation.” 

  


“Why does she even care?” Walker asks abruptly. “Last time we blew a gate, she vanished off the face of the universe and we found her in the 1990s,  she’d been just bumming around for fifty years and only came with us because they were renovating the building she was in and she didn’t want to move.” 

  


“Did you talk to her right after she got back at all?” JJ asks. 

  


“No.” Walker says. “Not right away, couple weeks later when we did a show up there. She seemed normal, got up with us in the lounge and everything.” 

  


“Man, when she realized how long it had been on this side, she flipped her shit. She had a fucking break down, I’m serious, like, crying and everything.” JJ says. 

  


“Why?” Walker shakes his head. 

  


“Dusty.” JJ says. “She’s in love with him, for real for real. It’s a good thing he’s still so young, I don’t even know what she would have done if he died while she was gone.” 

  


“He’s, what, eighty? Something like that?” Walker says. “How long do they live?” 

  


“Couple hundred years, he started up that ‘I’m old’ routine ‘cause of us. Humans, I mean. They were touring and doing shit over at their place until pretty recently.” JJ says. “The bridge went out and they never put it back.” 

  


“How long, exactly?” Walker asks. 

  


“Um, three, four years, somewhere right in there.” JJ says. 

  


“The same time May came back.” Walker says. “He’s got that brown coat, can he…” He makes a vague motion. 

  


“Yeah, his kid, too.” JJ says. “You know there’s a gate over there, right? It’s still got the lift down into it.” 

  


“Is it active?” Walker asks. 

  


“Not yet.” JJ says. “There’s a Controller sitting over there right now, though.” 

  


JJ stops the truck, which they’ve driven here because there’s a real driveway now. It’s stopped raining for the moment, the air is getting colder and the sky has taken on a particularly heavy look. It’s going to start snowing soon, probably in a few hours, and won’t stop until the Controller completes this stage of its life cycle. 

  


The front yard isn’t draining properly and their feet splash in a thin layer of standing water as they approach the house. It still looks the same, old and slightly grumpy about being disturbed. 

  


Walker holds the door for JJ and they go in. The clock is still sitting at 13:00, the timer obviously isn’t running yet, it’s just been taken out and set on the table. There does seem to be something different about the interior, though. Walker and JJ both notice it, but they have a great deal of trouble figuring out what exactly they are noticing. The place seems brighter than it had last time somehow, in a way that isn’t quite consistent with it just not being raining. 

  


JJ runs her finger along a table top and looks at it, then holds it out to Walker. “It’s clean.” 

  


And then Walker realizes it, too, the interior looks brighter because the layer of dust has been removed. The polished wooden floor is reflecting the light, as are the few remaining gilded objects. He slowly walks over and flips the switch on the wall next to the door, the overhead light comes on. 

  


“We have power.” Walker says. 

  


JJ holds her hand out over a radiator. “Heats on, too.” 

  


“Can’t have the pipes freezing.” Walker says. 

  


They go upstairs, the office is empty except for a large wooden desk. Walker opens a bedroom door and looks in. 

  


“What was that about the beds?” Walker asks. 

  


JJ sticks her head in. “Someone has changed the linens. After burning the old mattresses. What in the world is going on here, we’ve got security drones all over here, nobody has been in or out.” 

  


“Unless they’re doing it through that door that isn’t there.” Walker says. 

  


They aren’t particularly surprised to see that the latch to the basement door has been repaired. They are slightly more surprised to see a small sign taped to it- “Please Do Not Kick Door”. Walker tries the knob and it opens. 

  


Water immediately splashes through, soaking him. There is the sound of people clapping and cheering, a high pitched whistle and series of laughing calls, Walker slams the door shut. 

  


“What was that?” JJ asks. 

  


“Sea World.” Walker says. 

  


JJ laughs. “Well, guess that answers that question.” 

  


“Why do they have a gate to a marine animal park?” Walker asks. “What the hell are they doing?” 

  


“Aren’t the Controllers aquatic?” JJ asks. “For part of their life cycle, at least.” 

  


“Yeah.” Walker says. “They are.” 

  


“Justin!” JJ screams. “Justin!” 

  


A crow flies down through the chimney, lands on her shoulder with a puff of soot. “Chill, sheesh.” 

  


 JJ tugs the door open. “Get in there.”

  


“How did her parents die in a fire at Sea Parks?” The crow comments, then flies through the door. “Hey, watch it, ya big fish!” 

  


They look around the house while they wait. There isn’t really much to look at, aside from the books on the shelves. Most of them look like typical Victorian era texts, which JJ suddenly realizes is odd since it has all these electric appliances. They’re old, but obviously more recent than the house itself. She pulls one of the books down and opens it. 

  


“*Carrie*.” She reads the title on the printed page. She pulls another one down, then another. “*Christine, Misery, Insomnia*...” 

  


Walker grabs books and opens them, reading the actual titles. “*International UNIX Environments? Wicked Cool Bash Scripts*? What are these?” 

  


JJ shakes her head. “I have no idea.” 

  


They pull books down, looking at the first page then putting them in a pile on first the table, then the floor. It’s mostly a mix of fiction novels that are very old but, with the exception of the Sherlock Holmes books, had been written around a hundred years after the house was built, and what are obviously guides to something that Walker and JJ can’t understand, it looks like most of it is written in some sort of literal code, and the explanations clearly expect the reader to know what they’re talking about already. There are some random books thrown in there, coffee table type stuff, guide books filled with pretty pictures, a few about animals but it’s all surface knowledge. 

  


“What’s this?” Walker says. “It’s got a horse on it, but it’s a bunch of…” 

  


JJ takes the book, it’s very small, and looks at it. “Dressage tests.” 

  


“And that is?” Walker asks. 

  


“Exersises for training a war horse.” JJ shakes her head. 

  


“You know, I once saw May jump off a running horse onto a moving train.” Walker says. 

  


“I believe it.” JJ says. “She can get them to do all sorts of crazy shit.” 

  


“Is that one of her tricks?” Walker asks. 

  


“No.” JJ says. “No, Jim taught her to do that.” 

  


Justin swoops back in and lands on the pile of books. He has a pastry in his beak, which he begins to peck apart messily. Crumbs and frosting trickle down onto the books. 

  


“Well?” JJ says after a moment. 

  


“The fries are terrible.” Justin says. 

  


“Anything else?” JJ rolls her eyes. 

  


“Someone dropped their bearclaw.” Justin says. 

  


“I see that. How fortunate for you.” JJ says. “Did you see Adrian Kelsey?” 

  


“Nah, not his little creep, either.” Justin says. “Can I have some money?” 

  


“What do you need money for?” JJ asks.

  


“Fifteen smackaroos, lady.” Justin says. 

  


JJ sighs, pulls out her wallet and hands him a bill. “Better bring me change.” 

  


Justin flies away again, JJ looks at the crumbs. “Do you want ants, ‘cause that’s how you get ants.” 

  


“There aren’t any ants here.” Walker says distractedly. “Why does Kelsey have all this? Or Penny?” 

  


“I dunno, they both seem like something out of a King novel.” JJ says. 

  


“You could say the same thing about May.” Walker says. 

  


“Yeah, but she’s always the good guy.” JJ says. “She just doesn’t like to show it until halfway through the book, after everybody is good and scared.” She pauses thoughtfully. “You know, she’s got somebody with her. Pendergrass called and asked if that ‘little witch’ was down here.” 

  


“Rahal.” Walker says. “It has to be.” 

  


“Who’s that?” JJ asks. 

  


“She’s a bouncer. Well, general security, probably.” Walker says. “May seems quite fond of her.”

  


“Is she human?” JJ asks. 

  


“I think so.” Walker says. 

  


“Well, fuck me sideways.” JJ says. 

  


“That sounds painful.” Walker says.   



\---





May comes over and stops next to Rahal, still bouncing to the beat. “This is fun, yeah?” 

  


“Yeah.” Rahal says. “It is.” 

  


“You ever dance at clubs, kid?” May asks. 

  


“God, no.” Rahal says. 

  


“Why?” May asks. 

  


“Well it’s…I thought it was hard.” Rahal says. 

  


“That is some sad, sorry state y’all have gotten yourselves into.” May says. 

  


“I mean, it kinda is. I think I’m gonna be sore tomorrow.” Rahal says. 

  


“It’s all sorts of muscles you don’t normally use walking around.” May says. “Great exercise, beats going to the gym.” 

  


“Is that why you do it?” Rahal asks. 

  


“It’s a pleasant side effect.” May says. “I do it because I like it.” 

  


“Where did you…I mean, you do learn, right?” Rahal asks. “You showed them how to do that one.” 

  


“Sure, you just have to watch somebody and do what they do. Just pretend you’re in basic training, y’all still have drills, right, or do you do some memory insert bullshit and stick you on a machine to build your muscles.” May says. 

  


Rahal laughs. “Yeah, we still have basic training.” 

  


“Hey! Somebody toss me that umbrella!” May shouts, it comes flying at her a second later and she snatches it out of the air. “Check this out.” 

  


She starts flipping it around, Rahal realizes after a second she’s doing a rifle drill, but bouncing around a lot more. Rahal bursts into laughter. May tosses the umbrella away and starts pointing. “Directing traffic!” She makes the complicated circling motions again “Bugs on my hands! Bugs on my hands! Get ‘em off!” She starts the weird little pony dance again and skips away. 

  


Mac comes over and sits down next to her, he’s moving with the beat and Rahal starts doing it with him because it feels weird to sit still when everybody else is bopping around. 

  


“Man, I’m glad she’s back.” Mac says. 

  


“She was sad.” Rahal says. 

  


“Hm?” Mac twitches an ear. 

  


“May. She was just…not like this. I think she was depressed.” Rahal says. 

  


“Probably. She’s real attached to him, you know.” Mac nods at Dusty. 

  


“Yeah, I can see that.” Rahal says. “You think she’ll…oh, oh, nevermind, she is.” 

  


“What?” Mac asks. 

  


“Moving back down here.” Rahal says. “She wants to pull an ISTC paycheck and be able to write off rent on Falcron without actually being there. That bitch.” 

  


Mac laughs. “Yeah, that sounds about right.” 

  


Rahal stops moving, she really is getting tired. Mac keeps bouncing, but looks her up and down. 

  


“That nasty couch can’t be doing you any favors.” He says. 

  


Rahal shrugs. “I’ve slept on worse.” 

  


“Yeah, so have I.” Mac says. “But only if I have to.” 

  


“Ok.” Rahal says. 

  


“I’m saying you should sleep with somebody, in a bed.” Mac says. 

  


“Oh, um, that’s…” Rahal stumbles. 

  


Mac laughs. “Chill, I’m not hitting on you. There’s not enough room where I sleep, anyway. I was going to suggest Diesel.” 

  


“Oh.” Rahal says, that seems more acceptable. “Well, I mean I can’t just-” 

  


“Hey, D!” Mac shouts and she looks over. “Rahal’s gonna sleep with you.” 

  


“Whatever!” Diesel says brightly, not breaking step. 

  


“See?” Mac says. “Easy peasy, she doesn’t care. And she’s bored off her ass right now, all of her friends are either in shit weather or gridlock traffic.” 

  


“She was talking to one earlier, her screen name was Lex.” Rahal says. 

  


“Oh yeah, she lives Underground.” Mac says. “You gotta watch her, she follows the white rabbit.” 

  


“I have no idea what that means.” Rahal says. 

  


Mac laughs. “Don’t worry about it. She’s a little shady, but she does know things.”

  


“She had- Can you access things like ISTC shipping manifests publicly?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Yeah, why?” Mac asks. 

  


“Just trying to figure out how it works down here.” Rahal says. “ISTC doesn’t release stuff like that to humans unless we have special security clearance or something.” 

  


“Any particular reason why?” Mac asks. 

  


Rahal thinks about it for a few minutes. “Sometimes it’s so other humans don’t know what they’re doing and try to interfere, sometimes it’s so people don’t know what’s there and go try to steal it.” 

  


“Ok, I get that.” Mac says. 

  


“But, stuff like that doesn’t happen here?” Rahal asks. 

  


“I mean, folks steal shit sometimes. But when you have an ISTC shipment or something like that, the Marasats are gonna be watching it, they’re gonna know way before anybody even gets close and run them off. And it’s all logged, even if somebody can hide their location it still shows it’s been accessed by somebody.” Mac says. 

  


“And besides, building materials like that are useless here.” Rahal says. “Who would bother to try and steal them. Is there anything you can’t access?” 

  


“You can get someone’s registered address, but not any other info unless the person makes it available. If they don’t update it, it’ll just be whatever it was when they released it, though. You can search the library database using a name and get whatever was published about someone here. You can get info about major construction projects, if they’re growing something really big. You can look up property records, but they’re only really accurate if it’s brick and mortar- I mean, like, it’s not made of flora.” Mac tilts his head, thinking. “You can get arrival and departure schedules for ships, but you can’t get a passenger list unless it’s an ISTC vehicle. You can look up the license plate of an auto and see who it’s registered to, but that’s usually whoever imported it ‘cause they’ll come collect trashed vehicles and recycle them. If someone is registered as the driver you can see that, but that’s gonna be for stuff like doing deliveries through a company.” 

  


“What about information for people from other planets?” Rahal asks. 

  


“If I looked you up, it would give me your name, rank, ID number or whatever, and an image if they have one. Might give me whoever your supervisor is, but it would probably say to contact ISTC for that.” Mac says. “Same for any human that’s registered here, it’ll give a job title, though, if there is one.” 

  


“What about May?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Ooh, yeah. She officially does not exist, anywhere. Her home planet, maybe, but I dunno anything about that. I kinda get the feeling they aren’t big on keeping that kind of records.” Mac says. “She’s on the directory for Falcron as staff, but it’s basically a blank sheet that’s like ‘she’s not impersonating an officer’.” 

  


“Have you ever met any other people like her?” Rahal asks. “I mean, like, where she’s from.” 

  


“Nah, they don’t usually come over here.” Mac says. “They like to hang out with other folks that look a little more like they do. I think it’s easier to socialize that way.” 

  


“Boss!” Rahal shouts. 

  


“Who?” May hollers back. 

  


“May!” Rahal shouts. 

  


“What!” May shouts back. 

  


“Are you normal?” Rahal says at a slightly lower volume. 

  


“According to who?” May asks. 

  


“Your folks.” Rahal says. 

  


“I am a pain in the ass!” May waves her arms like a puppet. 

  


“You are!” Rahal says. “Are you more or less of a pain for your own people?” 

  


“Do I piss them off, you mean?” May asks. “A little, I guess, Neil keeps sending them complaints.” 

  


“You’re lazy and don’t want to do your job and it’s annoying.” Rahal says. 

  


“You hear that?” May says. 

  


“Sounds accurate.” Dusty says. 

  


“Oh, fuck you.” May says. 

  


“Any time.” Dusty says. 

  


“I guess that’s a yes, then.” Rahal says. “But why…why would somebody like her want to hang out with somebody like me? I don’t know how to do half the stuff she tells me to and she just looks, like, shocked. She’s gotta think I’m an idiot.” 

  


“Yeah, she mentioned that.” Mac says. “Not that you’re an idiot, that you don’t know stuff.”

  


“So, why?” Rahal asks. 

  


“Isn’t it obvious?” Mac seems surprised. “That old nanny goat decided to educate your sorry ass.”

  


Rahal rolls her eyes. “Look, I don’t know how she is with you guys, but she’s been my boss for awhile and like ninety percent of the time she just tells me to figure shit out.” 

  


“And do you?” Mac asks. 

  


“Well, yeah.” Rahal says. “Eventually, usually. Not always.” 

  


“And then she helps you?” Mac asks. 

  


“Well, yeah.” Rahal says “I mean, lots of the time she’s just like ‘ok’ after awhile and I guess does it herself.” 

  


“Yeah, she do be like that.” Mac laughs. “She knows things, but she’s gonna make you work for them. Including what you can and can’t actually accomplish on your own.” 

  


Rahal sighs. “I know, I just…well, I guess I expected her to be like the ones that were, like, real ISTC, you know, not just working there or whatever her deal is. There’s all this stuff you’re supposed to know and put down when you do the reports, she’s supposed to tell me what all those are when I file them but she won’t. I get stuff kicked back all the time because I can’t figure out what I’m supposed to use and the computer won’t accept it if it’s got conflicting information. I spend more time trying to figure out what code to put in than I do actually doing the stupid paperwork at the end.” 

  


“That sounds really frustrating.” Mac chuckles. “I’m sorry.” 

  


“I asked her what to do about it, and she said it sounded like I needed to learn what the codes meant.” Rahal says. “Then told me to go look it up.” 

  


“Did you?” Mac asks. 

  


“Well, yeah, but they’re supposed to tell you.” Rahal says. “So you know.” 

  


“Effective, was that?” Mac flicks an ear. “You obviously knew them all before you even met her.” 

  


“I did know a bunch of them!” Rahal says defensively. “It’s just that there are a bunch of, like, modifications you have to put on them in that one, because different areas of Falcron have different rules. Like, there’s a set of codes, Q9804-7-63, that’s basically ‘possession of wildlife without a permit’. But it won’t take just that code, you have to give it a location tag, and that’s where it starts getting really stupid. Cause, like, if you try to put that on one of the decks with all the clubs and stuff, or in a civilian area, or in any of the bays or even storage areas, it kicks it out. You have to use some other code, like PFD227-39-tk387-j: Confinement of a life form beyond reasonable measures, or EDK-87: Failure to provide adequate resources.” 

  


“And, you just know that off the top of your head.” Mac says. 

  


“Well, now, but-” Rahal stops. “That’s not exactly useful, is it?”

  


“Did you know how to dance this morning?” Mac asks. 

  


“No. I don’t think I know how to dance now.” Rahal says. 

  


“But you know a little.” Mac says. 

  


“Ok, yeah, I guess.” Rahal says. 

  


“And thus, it spreads, from mind to mind. From May to you, from you to someone else, from them to someone else, and on, and on, until the entire world is doing that weird little pony dance.” Mac makes the hand motion and Rahal laughs. 

  


“Ok, that’s funny but-” Rahal says. 

  


“Now, imagine that instead of seeing her dance, you saw her pick up a rock and use it as a hammer.” Mac says. “Imagine you saw her make a fire, or throw a rope over a limb and use it to lift something heavy.” 

  


“She made me change a tire.” Rahal says. “I didn’t even know you could do stuff like that to cars, I though you had to, like, call somebody, like with a ship.” 

  


“Could you teach somebody else to do that?” Mac asks. 

  


“Yeah, it’s easy.” Rahal says. 

  


“Alright, so how do I do it?” Mac asks.

  


“Oh, um…” Rahal says. “Ok, well, there's this long metal bar thing-” 

  


“Lug wrench.” Mac nods.

  


“And you use it to take off the…um…” Rahal hesitates. “The little things that keep the tire on.”

  


“Lug nuts.” Mac says. “How?”

  


“Just, like, it’ll turn if you push the end.” Rahal says.

  


“I dunno, they seem pretty tight.” Mac says. 

  


“Look, when you push on the end of the thingy, the bar, it’s easier.” Rahal makes motions with her hands. 

  


“Magic.” Mac laughs. “Ok, so they’re all loose, can I take the tire off?” 

  


“Oh, no!” Rahal laughs. “No, you have to pick it up. The vehicle, I mean.” 

  


“Wow, you guys are strong.” Mac says. 

  


“With a…thingy.” Rahal mimes. 

  


“A jack. Oh, ok, so, I do that first and…” Mac looks at her balefully. “You’re picking on me, if I do that, the wheel turns.” 

  


“Yeah, no, you do that after you loosen it, but before you take the tire off.” Rahal says. 

  


“Oh, ok. Why? Why doesn’t it turn when it’s down?” Mac asks. 

  


“Well, see, when it’s on the ground, like, there’s something to push on so you can get, like, leverage but that doesn’t work if…” Rahal says. 

  


“Le-ver-age?” Mac arches an eyebrow. 

  


Rahal hesitates. “Ok, ok, so, um…do you have, like, a stick or something I can-”

Now I'm in my mid 30s doing it all over again with a almost 1 yo I've realized I hate the baby stage. I say to myself every single day this is what living in hell feels like. I tell my husband this is the hell house made of nightmares. Now I get why some hope this life never finds them 

I miss my old life. I miss being able to sit on my couch and rot with a hot cup of coffee and a book. If I so much as look comfortable my baby will definitely find a leaf or something random on the floor no one else can see and put it in his mouth or decide he wants to meet the dog with violence. 

I miss being able to sit and talk with my husband and older kids. Playing boardgames watching  movies or tv, moving freely about my home whenever I want without having to worry about a baby eating dog food,  ripping apart everything in the house in 2.5 seconds or listening to crying from a gate. 

I miss sleep. I haven't had a full nights well rested sleep in well over a year. My baby still wakes up several times a night. Takes hours to go to bed. Rarely naps for longer than a hour. We cosleep I'm not interested in sleep training right now. Some nights he does sleep okay and goes to bed without a fight but most nights it's a battle. There is a heavy correlation between how well my baby does at bedtime and sleeps at night to how I feel the next day about my own existence 😂😭

I miss being able to shower whenever I want, eating food without standing while shoveling whatever quick bite I can find into my mouth. Sitting on the toilet without a small human grabbing at me. 

I'm so sick and tired of cleaning the stupid Ikea highchair 3+ times a day of food while yelling for my dog to come eat the scraps off the floor even though I just yelled at him 15 minutes before to get from the kitchen and away from the highchair. 

I'm constantly baby proofing, moving stuff, rearranging and deconstructing my house, buying shit in hopes it will make my life easier. Gates, storage, baby safety items, changing routines, planning and prepping and then the goal post moves. It's never enough. 

I miss being able to simply exist as a person without having to always be on so to speak. I feel like I'm in a constant state of survival mode and moving like everything is urgent. I have 20 minutes dishes, bottles, clean up, use the bathroom, find a snack, get a drink of water. Can't waste a single second. I feel ragged, worn down, physically, mentally and emotionally drained and exhausted. 

I love my little dude, seriously I do. I love waking up next to him in the morning and our babble chats at breakfast. Playing on the floor, reading our Barn Yard  dance book 847364 times a day and trips to the library.  Watching him grow and learn and take in the world. His sweet cuddles and the way we hold hands when he's laying down. 

JFC I feel like I've aged 10 years in 1 year. Have lost years off of life. Living like this feels so unhealthy and taxing. I know it gets better, that this is only a temporary season and before I know it these things will be non issues but wow it's hard
 when those days seem out of reach, nowhere insight.

1q0ut2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement_IN/comments/1q0ut2g/perfecting_the_product_estimation_question_an/,Perfecting the Product Estimation Question: An End-to-End Guide and Walkthrough Solution,"When I first saw product estimation questions in interviews, I froze. The math felt intimidating, and I had no idea where to start (especially with my lack of mental math skills).

I eventually realized interviewers are not testing whether you land on the “correct” number. They’re testing whether you can:

1. structure an ambiguous problem,
2. make grounded assumptions, and
3. focus on the few drivers that matter.

Here's a repeatable framework to answer product estimation questions with minimal memorization:

**1) Clarify the ask (30 seconds)**  
Scope, timeframe, the company, product, success metrics etc. and how detailed they want the answer.

**2) Pick the right framework (5 options)**  
Most questions fit into one of these:

* Top-down (start with population, filter down)
* Bottom-up (start with a unit, scale up)
* Funnel (conversion at each step)
* Frequency × penetration (users × % who do it × how often)
* Fermi decomposition (for curveballs)

**3) Segment MECE + sanity check**  
Avoid overcomplicating inputs, then validate with a quick “1 in N” check or capacity check. For example, to apply the ""1 in N"" check, if you assume that there are 10 million coffees consumed each day in NYC - dividing that by 8 million (number of NYC residents) - that's 1.25 coffees per person. Gauge if that sounds correct.

Estimation questions can feel tricky to apply in practice, so I walk through a full, end-to-end solution **step by step** [**here**](https://youtu.be/jH_cKolMPX0?si=6YMtAPJ8J1aAea_8). I break down the popular estimation question: “Estimate the number of pennies in Manhattan” and show how to structure the problem, make reasonable assumptions, and sanity check the result.

For more information about the framework, feel free to **check out this** [**video**](https://youtu.be/8c0lRXbAvX0?si=xzjAoKKHtblgtnGH)!

1q0uqla,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1q0uqla/my_parents_refuse_to_talk_to_my_inlaws/,My parents refuse to talk to my in-laws,"Hey everyone, my husband and I (both 24) have been married for almost 3 years and have been together 5. In that time frame, our parents have interacted only a handful of times at important life events (both of our families are local), but each and every conversation has only been initiated by my in-laws. My family is pretty standoffish in general, and neither of them have many friends. They do love and interact with my husband though. 

I pretty much have the dream situation when it comes to my in-laws. They welcomed me in with open arms immediately and have been so kind to me. My husband and I just had our first baby in August and they’ve been so involved while also respecting whatever boundaries we have. My MIL regularly has offered to come clean my apartment for me while I was both pregnant and postpartum if that tells you what kind of person she is. 

My mom hasn’t said anything to me specifically, but I’ve always had this feeling she doesn’t care for my mother in law even though I’ve given her no reason to dislike her. Before we got engaged, my MIL asked my mom to coffee to get to know each other since they hadn’t met and I never heard of anything that went wrong.

When we were in the wedding planning stage, my MIL offered to throw me a bridal shower. When I brought it up to my mom, she got offended saying “Well usually it’s the MOH’s duty to throw your shower.” The thing is, my MOH never offered to throw me one. So my MIL threw me my bridal shower. Apparently my parents never thanked my in-laws for hosting my bridal shower or the wedding rehearsal dinner and made zero effort to talk to them at all during any of our wedding events, including the actual wedding day. 

My in-laws have reached out to my parents multiple times to try and get together because in their eyes we’re all considered family, and once kids come into the picture they just want to be friendly when it comes to all the grandchildren events. I also think they’re used to be BIL’s wife’s parents being a lot more involved with them. They aren’t best friends, but they are super friendly during any joint events. My parents have just either rejected or just flat out ignored anytime they have reached out. 

At my baby shower it genuinely just felt so awkward because I felt like I had to split my time up with both my families because they just won’t talk to each other. My MIL went up to try and talk to my mom and she talked to her for maybe a couple minutes before my mom went to find her best friend and wouldn’t talk to anyone else the whole time. I will give props to my dad for going to sit with my in-laws and talked to them for the majority of the time. Even our grandmas were chatting it up and getting along. 

My final straw was my mom complaining afterwards to me that at the baby shower, my husband’s aunt “put my brother (16) on the spot and made him uncomfortable”. I asked what happened and all she did was ask him if he was “shy like his sister.” I told her that she can come off as a little strong sometimes but I swear she means well. My mom flipped on me saying that “She’s allowed to have a different opinion than me and just because she has a different opinion doesn’t mean she’s wrong.” I simply told her I didn’t appreciate her bashing my in-laws in front of me because it made me uncomfortable. She then got super defensive and goes “Oh that’s what you think we were doing?” Even though my dad had just been complaining over finding my husband’s aunt annoying right in front of me. 

I just don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t really expect them to be best friend but I wish there wasn’t this tension. I also don’t want to be stressing at every event for our kids over how awkward things are going to be with everyone together. Has anyone been through anything like this before?

I was surprised to see an Ykanti female and a human male cleaning my house. 

I went into the bakery and got some croisant for breakfast and coffee.

Aino showed me to my office on the third floor accross his new office.

I asked Aino to please send all those that are bookepers to see me so I can interview them. No rush tho.

When I was coming to City Hall I saw a Baronry shuttle flying with a Baco under it. I saw it lowering it beside other heavy machinery in a row and dropping it gently.

It then landed to unload all kind of cases of nails shovels and many other tools to build things.
.
Can't wait to get the tablets I will be instantly capable to communicate with all residents.

I was in the office 1 hour when the florist delivered me flowers for my office.

First bookeeper came to meet me. Found out he use to do the books for restaurants. I asked if he would mind doing the books with assistance for the restaurants and the Inn. Aino gave him a desk upstairs. He will introduce himself to the main cooks of each place. I need to give each place a ledger to keep debit and credit ledgers. He will teach them how to fill them.

I will need laptops for all bookepers. An accounting program should be procured for the baronry also. Note to Wyett the need.

Even tho most records will be digital we might need shelves built as a file system or should we get lockable file cabinets.

Got a away board for my door. When ever I have errands I can close my door and leave a note of where I went to.

Found out there are two Ykanti restaurants. I never tried Ykanti food so will have supper at one of them tonight.

Ok many bookeepers interviewed today. I will get a few to help me with the Baronry. A few more to help with the General. Wyett ask me if I could help the General so of course I agrreed. Mind you That is so much money for me to handle. I can handle it. 

We need to also get real credits. I will try to get space in the new station. This would be a great place to have a space to advertise vacations in Newtown. Sell beer etc to Station. Provide fresh foods to Gardens and station. Last but not least sell our souvenirs to captains in bulk to resell. We would need sample flown in each day to sell and demonstrate.

Dealing in Haego is fine but real people with real credits are in space.

1q0unez,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1q0unez/trip_planning_itinerary_check/,Trip Planning - Itinerary Check,"Hi all,

  
I'm starting to plan a 10-day Iceland trip for June 2026 for a family of 3. We have a 9yo with us. I've spent quite some time tweaking an itinerary generated by ChatGPT 5.2 and came up with the itinerary below.

  
The reason I used GPT is because I want to book the hotels ASAP since we are a bit late already (I think), and then figure out the details of the trip. However the details of the trip (where to go, when...etc) can affect the hotels that I book, particularly how many nights at each location, and where.

  
Could you please help me take a look and let me know whether there are any glaring holes in this itinerary? I added a few preferences such as: only surrounding areas of Reykjavik and the south coast, no north coast (not doing the whole ring road). Avoid 1 night per location.  No strenuous hikes (due to the young kid).

  
Itinerary below is 2 nts at Reykjavik, 3 nts at Vik, 2 nts at Jökulsárlón, then 2 nts at Reykjavik again.

TIA!

There are four of them, three males and a female, and an unattended mic stand center stage. Most humans would say they look a bit like dogs around the head, with a long muzzle and large, expressive ears. The female has an intricate coat pattern of stripes and spots, her mane scattered black, white, and silver and she’s wearing quite a bit of jewelry. The bass player is gray with darker stripes and mane, the guitar and drum players are white and brown, respectively, with darker manes.



""Oh he is? Alright! I'm Benni, this is our guitarist Vincent, Mac on bass, Rick is our drummer and...""



The lead singer enters stage left and the crowd breaks into cheers and applause. Benni looks him up and down and makes a face. He’s not particularly tall, rather gangly, a bit scruffy, with uniform tawny brown fur and a mane of the same color. He also looks like he’s been rolling around in the dirt. 

  


He takes a mic. ""What?""

  


""How'd you get so dusty?"" Benni asks. 

  


He looks down at himself and slaps at his pants, a cloud rises around him and the crowd laughs. ""I live on a dirt road."" The crowd whoops and laughs.

  


""And after his long, loooong, loooong ride down that dirt road to get here-""

  


Benni stops mid sentence and coughs, goes over to get a bottle of water and takes several swallows. Dusty rolls his eyes and motions ‘wanking it’. Benni returns to center stage, gives him a stern look, then raises a hand. “Two.. three…four!”



Rycacia is dominated by two species belonging to a single genus, “Marasattus”, or, as they are generally called, Marasats. There are other species of Marasat, they are a colonizing race, but none of the other highly intelligent ones live here. The two that are here are listed in human life-form databases as “Marasattus ornamens” and “Marasattus rycacianna”. The primary difference is that “ornamens” lives mostly under the surface, and “rycacianna” live up on top.



Marasattus rycacianna is comprised of two subtypes, ‘Greater’ and ‘Lesser’ Rycacian Marasats, respectively. The only obvious physical difference is that Lesser Marasats always appear to have a uniform tawny brown coat of fur, and the Greater generally have various patterns and markings and tend to be very slightly larger.



The Lesser Rycacian Marasats are closer genetically to ‘ornamens’, they still have a few traits the others have completely lost. They appear an unimpressive brown color under most light found on the surface, but they can and do bioluminesce under the right conditions. They can also generate enough of an electrical charge to give an attacker a thoroughly bad time.





Dusty, therefore, is a Lesser Marasat, the rest of the band are Greater Marasats. The genes associated with the Lesser Marasats are recessive but very common, there’s about a one in five chance you’ll get them with two Greater Marasats. There are lots of them around, and most of them aren’t related.

  


Several days later, a little tawny brown Rycacian child is standing the window, looking out into the night. Her name is Diesel, she and Dusty are related, she’s his daughter. She appears to be around the equivalent of a four or five year old human, she can speak clearly and is able to feed and dress herself but will be referred to as a “baby” until her natural defense system develops, which will be a few years still. It’s way past her bedtime, she’d spent the last couple hours laying in bed under a pile of blankets pretending to be asleep every time her mother opened the door to check on her. It’s late enough now that her mother will have decided it’s OK to leave her completely alone until it’s time to get up. She used to come in constantly all night, but her dad had finally gotten the message through that waking a kid up every hour was definitely not healthy.

  


The bedroom door opens and Dusty pokes his head in. ""Hey, I thought you were supposed to be in bed.""

  


Diesel shakes her head absently. ""It's too loud.""

  


“Up here?” Dusty motions to her head, and she nods. He leaves briefly and returns with a pair of headphones. ""Do NOT tell Mommy I did this.""

  


He almost runs into his wife, Sophia, in the hall a minute later. She’s irritated at him, as usual. ""Where have you been?"" 



""Up on Factory Road."" Dusty instinctively brushes dirt off of himself.



""Doing what?"" Sophia snaps.



""Fixin that old clunker Mac's dad left him."" Dusty refuses to play into her aggression.



“Oh, come on. That piece of shit is never gonna fly again.”Sophia rolls her eyes.



“Of course it will. It’s all mechanical.” Dusty shrugs.



“Get a job and buy a real ship.” Sophia says.



“You get a job and buy a real ship if you want one so bad.” Dusty says.



Sophia narrows her eyes at him, but she really doesn’t have much of a defense against that since she could theoretically be pulling in a paycheck. There isn’t any reason Dusty can’t just take Diesel with him everywhere, and he’s perfectly willing to do so, but Sophia objects on the grounds that the baby will get broken.



Dusty finds that attitude incredibly irritating because he comes from Hangdog, a particularly challenging area of the environment, and has a history of climbing mountains and walking across deserts with random babies clinging off of him like little opossums. If you stand still long enough over there, some ankle biter will adhere itself to you and you’ll have a little voice squeaking questions in your ear until someone pries them off and hauls them back home or they find someone more interesting to latch onto. The second he was physically large enough, his younger siblings and relatives had been all over him. He has a



What Dusty is doing now is basically what he was doing back then, as a courier across areas that require a land vehicle and member of a moderately successful rock band. Neither of those are particularly dangerous, most of his friends are musicians and therefore ‘weird’ to some degree but none of them are violent and lots of them have children of their own they haul around with them.



Several days later, the clunker is in repairs. It...does not look amazing. The ship is old, and it’s been allowed to sit in a barn for decades. But it was made by some human somewhere, and machines made by humans can be fixed. Human machines don’t care where something came from or what it’s made of, it’s about pushing and pulling and moving electricity from one place to another. You can cannibalize other machines, even replace parts with organic components, if it works it works. There are plenty of human machines around here, old cars and trucks and the occasional ship. 

  


They could theoretically just replace the mechanical components with organic ones, you can buy a kit that will supposedly do it from the Marasats. But it’s not just about having a working method of transportation, it’s about aesthetic. And besides, they all like the human tech, you can see what things do, and humans spend a lot of time documenting everything. There had been piles of paper instructions stashed in the cockpit repair box, apparently the human that made it had been sure to keep everything that came packaged with the components. 

  


It was legitimately a bit of a mess, everything that wasn’t made of metal had fallen apart and it’s definitely got some rust issues, but it’s far from a lost cause. Mac is the only one in his family who can understand any of the human languages without a translator, which is why he’d eventually been saddled with the ship. Mac definitely wouldn’t try to go long distances, and there's no way its safe for actual space travel right now, but the engine does turn over and they’ve gotten her in the air a couple times.  



Dusty has Diesel with him today, she’s sitting in a little pink chair, crumbling up a granola bar and feeding it to several rather overweight pigeons. There are more of the birds hanging around in what’s left of the old barn.



The birds abruptly fly away and Diesel points. ""What's that, daddy?""

  


The adults all stop what they are doing and look, Vincent slowly lowers the tool in his hand. ""Fuck me.""

  


Large black nematode-like creatures are swarming toward them, moving incredibly fast. They topple and roll over trees, leaving slimy wreckage that emits a noxious chemical mist. There’s nowhere for the Rycacians to go but into the ship and hopefully up. The engine catches immediately and Vincent yanks the controls upward, the stabilizers aren't working correctly and they rock and shudder but the ship is able to rise and hover. There is a rough circle of destruction, structures collapse, something is on fire, vehicles tear away as people frantically flee the area. 

  


""What the everloving fuck!” Dusty says angrily. “Why are there so many of them? Where the fuck did they all come from!""

  


Benni is standing in front of her bar, a hand shading her eyes. She’d heard the alert go off and is now watching as emergency vehicles stream by in both directions. The affected area covers where Dusty lives, she’d tried to contact him but first gotten no answer and then a message that the system was temporarily down. Mac and Vincent hadn’t answered, either, she’d gotten hold of Rick but he was miles away at some symposium. 

  


These animals had started appearing not too long before Benni joined the band. Nobody seems to be sure exactly where they came from, they aren’t native, but what is obvious is that they are rapidly evolving into a massive problem. They seem to be able to shake off most of what the Rycacians, humans, and everybody else has been able to throw at them so far, and the response is becoming steadily more aggressive.

  


A particularly gnarly POS limps over and stall/lands in the lot behind the bar. Benni goes back to see if it's somebody she knows and is very relieved to find her missing friends. Mac takes Diesel, and they and Vincent go inside. 

  


""How bad is it?"" Benni asks. 

  


Dusty shakes his head. ""It's bad. BAD bad.""

  


An emergency siren begins to wail. Dusty grabs her hand and pulls Benni inside, slams the door. Ship engines roar overhead, followed by a thin mist of falling particulate. The guys have turned the news on and are both watching the screen, Diesel is sitting on the bar between them. She’s gotten hold of Vincent’s hat and is slowly filling it with shredded napkins.



""Does that shit actually do anything?"" Benni asks. 

  


""Besides killing our kids?"" Dusty narrows his eyes as another wave of ships pass over, dumping chemicals.

  


Dusty is being somewhat dramatic, the various chemicals they’re using tend to irritate mucus membranes and cause digestive upset, a kid will feel kinda rotten for a day or two if they get a face full, but it certainly won’t kill them. Not even Diesel, who has a medical condition that, according to her mother, is severe.



Benni isn’t sure about that, though. Not the part about Diesel having a diagnosis, that’s true and she was typically symptomatic when she was a little younger. She should have grown out of most of that by now, though, and Benni strongly suspects that the persistent symptoms are not directly related to her illness. Sophia hovers over the child, treating her as though she’ll shatter if you breathe on her too hard, hardly letting her outside, pumping her full of supplements and medications and making her do all sorts of exercises that were supposed to do...whatever. What they are actually doing is making everyone involved completely miserable.

  


Dusty, in typical fashion, ignores the instruction sheets that are always pinned to the girl’s shirt and follows what is actually medically best practice- which is to just treat her like a normal child. Dusty carries her around with him everywhere, and if he doesn’t have her in his arms or on his shoulders, one of the others does. This isn’t because she has trouble getting around, quite the opposite- if you put her down, she’ll immediately zip off and find something to get into.



The door opens and a male human steps in, he’s wearing a uniform that marks him as belonging to ISTC, the organization aiding in the current extermination effort. He looks around, taking a head count, then leaves without saying anything. That isn’t surprising, most of them don’t speak Rycacian very well, and they’re too far from a base for them to assume the Rycacians here would speak a human language. 

  


Dusty has a keen interest in humans, but it’s focused almost exclusively on ancient Earth culture and the English language circa the 20th century. It is effectively a dead language, mostly used as part of historical reproductions or novelty acts. Most of the humans that come here, therefore, don’t hold much interest for him. There had been one he was very interested in for awhile before he met Sophia, nasty little thing, even for a human. She’d eventually been fired or thrown in jail or murdered or something. Good riddance to bad rubbish.

Twenty years later…

  


A female officer is sitting in one of the generic security stations on Falcron Station with her feet up on a panel. Her name is May, she looks human and thoroughly bored. She sits up abruptly and leans forward, taps the display and brings up Dusty’s ID from the local database. She accesses the information for his transportation and looks at the ship specs, then footage of it from the landing bay. It’s a piece of shit, it’s amazing it even makes it up here. 

  


She taps the display several more times and pulls up the complete inspection report, then details of the ‘audio equipment’ and looks down the list. There are a few things that stand out, though they aren’t illegal, just a little odd. The guitars are ‘vintage’, old wood and fiberglass, and should have come fitted with adapters for the Marasat audio processors. But they have the cables listed, and after a second she finds a few amplifiers, it looks like they’re only using the adapters to feed it into the main audio system for the venue. The mics they have are the same, cables that run across the stage and will trip you up if you don’t pay attention and are dancing around the way Dusty likes to. There is a magnetic reel-to-reel recorder that doesn’t have any adapters except for the power source, an old boom box that records on magnetic cassettes, an ancient video camera that records on VHS, a very old sound mixing board, and a few other apparently random pieces of ancient equipment that would require the end result be run through a converter to play anywhere other than somewhere that has actual speakers made accept the input- which they don’t have on the ship, but they do have some headphones so they must at least occasionally record on it. Why? To get stuff that sounds more ‘authentic’ to the originals style? Why not just record on modern equipment then run it through a filter or just press it into vinyl and get all those nice clicks and pops from the record player? She knows for a fact that Factory Deal sells actual records, she’s got a few of the older albums and she’s seen the new ones for sale around here.

  


""Computer, will you bring up security footage from their last visit ordered chronologically, please?"" The screen goes black, then begins with the bay security cameras. 

  


“Spin on.” May says and the footage speeds up until she motions for it to return to normal speed. The drone security at Club Mango, following them as they go through the maze of backstage halls. They veer off when the band enters a green room and the footage switches to the show floor feed, the drones circling the stage and getting close ups of the band members. Dusty is absent, a drone finds him just off stage, talking to one of the dancers. 

  


May has the footage back up and slow down, she manages to catch a few frames of his kid, it must be since she looks just like him, sitting backstage at some sort of control setup. They’re using the vintage mic and guitar cables, but they run into the audio equipment for the club. They definitely aren’t using the vintage recording and mixing equipment here, they must have left it on the ship.



May motions at the screen and it starts to play again, now circling the band members. Benni looks irritated, Dusty is missing, he comes onto stage after long enough to let the viewers know he’s officially late. Dusty immediately starts talking, the drone footage is focused in on him, switching from full body to close up shots of his face.



He’s extremely expressive, his body language exuberantly friendly. Once the band strikes up and he starts singing, May knows he’ll be dancing around on stage. He probably won’t do it at Mango, but he’ll get down in the audience and shit, too.

  


""Wake up!"" Someone jostles her seat hard enough to make May jump. 

  


""What!"" May twists around to find Rahal. 

  


Rahal is a security officer as well, though she’s considerably younger than May. She was assigned to Falcron a few years ago, and quickly became what the station supervisor referred to as May’s Minion. 

  


“He's hot, isn't he.” Rahal says. 

  


“Adam?” May asks. 

  


“Adam? Who’s Adam, wasn’t that…oh my GOD you KNOW him know him!” Rahal hoots.

  


May grabs her arm. ""Shut up! You want everybody to know?""

  


""Kinda"" Rahal giggles. 

  


“Look, that was a really long time ago.” May says. “I haven’t talked to him in, like, forever.”  

  


“Did you just, like, know him socially or…” Rahal prompts. 

  


“I refuse to answer that question.” May says. “Don’t you have work to do?” 

  


""Sir, yes sir."" Rahal salutes and squawks like a chicken. 

  


It takes a very special sort of person to live and work long term on this particular station. Falcron was originally manufactured during eradication efforts on the planet below, controlled by ISTC, who regulates travel and shipping between planets. After the eradication, the station was expanded and is now largely dedicated to shopping and entertainment. There are around a thousand permanent residents, around half of which were displaced by the infestation. The expansion was done by Marasats, who were very well meaning in their attempts to create a pleasant human habitat but missed the mark slightly. 

  


The aesthetic modeling hides it in the civilian areas, but you’ll still start to see things that are just a bit off after awhile. The way things don't “start” and “stop”, they grow from each other, the way nothing ever seems to have a straight edge, the way the layout of the corridors doesn't actually make any sense. The material behind the manufactured panels is a network of glowing roots and bulbs that twitch and flash as signals run through. In the lower decks, it doesn't even look vaguely like a station anymore, just tunnels of flora occupied by Marasats and the occasional other bizarre life form. 

  


For some reason which has baffled everyone, the place is also home to a thriving colony of pigeons. They perch, nest, and poop where they like, and are impossible to get rid of. 

  


""Computer."" May says when she’s alone again. 

  


""Yes, Captain?"" The computer speaks in a soothing but no-nonsense female voice. 

  


""Oh, I like that one."" May says. ""What voice is that?""

  


""This voice is labeled ""Ship Computer Wife Classic"", Captain.""

  


""Do you always have to call me 'Captain'?"" May asks.

  


""Yes, Captain."" The computer says somewhat sarcastically. 

  


May makes a face. ""Fine, whatever. Can you look up this band, Factory Deal?""

  


""What would you like to know?""

  


“Let me see their finances.” May says, then, after looking for a minute, “That can’t be right. They’re flying around in a fifty year old hunk of junk, why would they…is it just aesthetic? Do they own properties or something?”

  


“Factory Road Productions, registered landowners.” A flyover comes up. 

  


It looks like it was an actual industrial facility at some point, and it's clearly out in the wastelands somewhere. It looks effectively inaccessible except by ship, surrounded by jagged canyons. She can see the remains of a road, it looks like there had been a bridge at one point but it’s either washed out or been destroyed some other way. It looks like the place has a sky rat problem, too, there are pigeons all over the place.

  


“Do we have better footage?” May asks. 

  


The computer thinks for a few seconds, then begins to play various clips from interviews and music videos. There

  


“Can you bring up footage of his kid?” May asks. “What’s her name?”

  


“Diesel, ‘Baby D’, age 25.” A video comes up. Diesel is on stage in front of a crowd, a banner behind her reads “Falcron Hospital Annual Benefit Concert”.



At 25, she’s adult, but probably still living with her parents. They don’t tend to leave until they have a good reason, which is generally lack of space. Given the size of their facility, it’s likely anybody she’s involved with will end up moving out there. The Rycacians always live in groups, it’s very rare to see less than three at any given time.  

  


“When I was little, little little, I got sick, y’all. Bad. I thought I was gonna die. Everybody *else* thought I was gonna die. But then, the power of music cured me.” Diesel pauses to let the crowd react. “No, seriously, y’all, let's hear it for the excellent staff at Falcron Hospital, they save lives, please donate generously.”

  


May leans back, shakes her head slowly. She looks almost exactly like Dusty, she’s got to be straight Lesser Marasat. Benni certainly couldn’t be her biological mother.



“Computer, is Dusty currently-” May starts to ask but is interrupted by a voice behind her.





""Misuse of company resources!"" The voice of their resident bureaucrat, Neil Pendergrass.

  


May turns around to find Neil jabbing a finger in her face. He seems to have made a hobby of finding reasons to write her up. This has had absolutely no effect on her behavior, and only results in getting angry messages about excessive paperwork.

  


""Oh, blow me."" May says. ""537B, Cornelia Robinson, refuses to clean up after her dog. You can catch her if you hurry, he's five million years old and it takes awhile for him to pop a-""

  


Neil throws his hands up. ""Fine, you’re monitoring the place! That still doesn't make watching a show work related.”

  


“It might be, though.” May says. “You know anything about this ‘Dusty’ character?” 

  


Neil blinks at her in surprise. “The singer? I’ve heard they do a lot of charity stuff and he’s supposed to be pretty nice. Was that who you were looking at?”

  


“I knew him, about a million years ago.” May says. “We lost touch.”

  


“That is *super* not work related.” Neil says. 

  


“Well, no. But…look at that ship, and they apparently live in an actual, like, factory. Or what's left of one.” May says. 

  


“I mean, I think that's sort of their thing. They leaned into the post-apocalyptic vibe pretty hard.” Neil says. 

  


“But they get paid, right? The statements show transfers.” May says. “So where is it all going?”

  


Neil sighs and brings the records up. “Well, RCV and GER are both environmental restoration, GRNR and CRME are nature management, RBR and TWS are family and housing…looks like the last time they hit Mango the profits went to the hospital here on Falcron, here’s a couple that look like local clinics. I’d say offhand the most likely thing would be petty tax and fee evasion, hardly something nefarious and definitely not our jurisdiction."" 

  


“I saw him at Mango.” May says.

  


“Ok.” Neil says. “And he was flashing wads of cash?”

  


“No.” May laughs. 

  


“Then it was probably nothing. Get back to work.” Neil says. 



May had been at Club Mango last night to look at the stage, but had been called away to deal with a situation in another establishment. The place is closed for patrons this time of day, but the doors open automatically to let her in. She hasn’t seen it with the lights up since it was constructed. The ceiling is so high, it vanishes into shadow. The wall across from the main entrance is occupied by a large stage, three sections making a slight curve. Behind the center section, a rectangular scaffold extends thirty feet into the air. Several pigeons are sitting on it, more are scattered around on the support beams for the lights and effects. There is a Marasat crouched at a panel by the stage, messing with something.

  


“Hello.” May says. “What's your designation?”

  


“Code.” A mix of voices, male and female. 

  


“Do you like music?” May asks.

  


“Yes, we enjoy music.” The Marasat says. 

  


“Were you here for Factory Deal?” 

  


“Program 23 sequence 8.” The Marasat says. 

  


“Oh, for the stage?” May says. “Can I see it? Up close?” 

  


“Your clearance allows it.” Code says. 

  


A few minutes later, May is standing on a narrow platform, looking out over nothing. She’s taken off her shoes, jacket, and most of the random crap she carries around.  The frame in front of her is completely empty. She had expected to see *something*, but there aren't even crossrails up right now. She reaches out and puts her hand through, nothing but air. 

  


“Activating.” Code says. 

  


The air shimmers slightly, like a heat mirage, and the pigeons fly away making disgruntled sounds. When May puts her hand out again, it gives slightly then becomes solid. She steps up onto the frame, then puts a foot out and tests the surface. It feels like a gymnastic mat, gives a little but obviously solid. She steps out onto nothing and walks across to the middle. 

  


“Three, two, one.” Code says. 

  


The invisible surface vanishes and May yelps as she drops sharply, convinced for a second she is going to splat on the floor below. She stops in the middle section. Just, stops. No surface to stand on, she can twist freely. Gravity gently returns, but now it's pulling her to stage left. She turns to orient herself, and her feet hit an invisible wall/floor. May kicks off and the gravity vanishes, returns to orient her toward the other side. 



She points down toward the frame below her and snaps her fingers, the edges glow, then gravity pulls her down and she’s standing on a ‘floor’. She walks over and kneels down, looking at the places where the frame joins together. There are little arrays of flora there, covered with some sort of rubbery housing. She knows what it looks like inside, she’s more interested in where and how it’s getting power.



This device doesn’t actually do anything to gravity, not really. What it does looks like zero-g, and feels very similar, but isn’t. This stage is creating a space within a space and then rotating it around the people inside, gravity is always pulling ‘down’, but ‘down’ in relation to what is inside changes.



She makes an “up” motion, and the floor takes her to the top of the array and stops. May looks up, frowns, it’s dark up there. She stands looking up, squinting into the shadows, long enough for a pigeon to come land on her shoulder.



“You nest up there?” May asks. The bird shakes it’s head, May nods. “That’s what I thought.”

  


As May is returning to her quarters later, she sees a band poster has been stuck to her door. Factory Deal, of course. It’s not for an upcoming show, though, or the most recent one. This poster is old, printed off at someone's house on paper that’s starting to yellow and crumble at the edges. 

  


In her room, May pokes the display screen at the bottom of her bed with a foot. “Hey, you got a discography for Factory Deal?”

  


“Sure, hun, got that right here for you.” The computer says. 

  


“Oh, that’s….which voice is that?” May asks. 

  


“It’s called ‘That One Lady Dontcha Know’.” The computer says. 

  


May shakes her head. “Play something.”

  


“This one’s called ‘Lady at the Fuel Stop’, hun.” 

  


May huffs a laugh. The tune is catchy, but the lyrics leave something to be desired. They’re mostly in Rycacian, with a few common and easily recognizable words and phrases in English- “sexy lady”, “pickup truck”, “pump my gas”. 

  


“What about something else? They have anything that's not hot chicks and fast cars?” May asks. 

  


“The title of this song is ‘Roof for Relaxing’, it's very popular, dontcha know.” That One Lady says. 

  


This one is leaning into punk rock pretty hard, and tells a somewhat cohesive though comedic story where noise complaints against the band escalate and are retaliated against, eventually devolving into a riot, war, and the planet exploding while the band plays on. May has a sneaking suspicion someone actually did file a noise complaint and this was the band’s way of telling them exactly where they could shove their opinion.



The door opens and Rahal comes in. “What's that?”

  


“Your favorite band.” May says. 

  


“Play a video.” Rahal says. 

  


“Sure, hun, which one you want?” The computer asks. 

  


“Do you have one from Blue Star?” May asks. 

  


“Sure, hun. Here you go.”

  


Blue Star is on Rycacia, May had picked it because she knew he used to play there. The place has obviously undergone some renovations and updates, but it’s still only big enough for maybe two hundred people. The house lights are on low, even though the stage lights are fully up. Most of the patrons are standing close to the stage. The band is already up there, sans Dusty who comes out fashionably late. He starts talking to the crowd, getting down at the edge of the stage to pass things back and forth. Rahal is listening to his schtik, which is quite entertaining, but May is watching Dusty closely. After awhile, Benni breaks up the socializing and they start playing music. Dusty is dancing around with the mic, getting up close with the other band members, making eye contact and gesturing to the crowd. They’re obviously all just having a good time out there. 

  


“That looks like fun.” Rahal says.



They’ve stopped playing, and Dusty is addressing the audience again. “I was down in Hangdog the other day. You guys know where that is?”

  


May leans forward and frowns, she’s just spotted a couple pigeons hanging out on one of the lighting rails.

  


A smattering of applause. Dusty points and waves at them. “Hey, y’all! How's your mom n ‘em?” Laughter, someone shouts an answer, more laughter. “Oh, well when they get out the hospital you tell them that's why we don't drink n drive. So I was out there, five million miles from nowhere, cause my dear old Mama lives there.”

  


The audience makes cooing sounds and he waves them off. “Oh, no, y’all, she ain't that kind of mama. No, no, she’s great though, seriously. Anyway, I was down there and she told me, she said ‘Son, I don’t like your music.” The audience laughs as Dusty arches an eyebrow. “Right? She said ‘Son, I don't like your music but there must be something to it because they play it on the radio here. All. The. Time.” The audience cheers. “And she turned on the radio and goddamn, ‘Road Home’ was on!” He lets the audience react for a few seconds, then talks over them. “And I said, that's just a fluke and she said ‘oh, no, this is *request only*. So if anybody from over there is watching, we appreciate it, guys.”

  


“You ok, Boss?” Rahal asks. 

  


May doesn’t turn from the screen. “Fine, why?”

  


“You’ve been kind of…” Rahal hesitates. “Interested in Dusty.”

  


“It’s nothing.” May says. “How much do you know about him?” 

  


“I mean, I read tabloids sometimes.” Rahal says. “Apparently he has trouble with women, can’t imagine why.” 

  


“He’s always broke, for one.” May says. “Money goes in one hand and right out the other, always has, looks like it still does.” 

  


“He does…like…girls, right?” Rahal asks. 

  


“As far as I know, why?” May asks. “Are you interested?” 

  


“Me? No, that’s…they’re hot and all, but…” Rahal shakes her head. “They’re a little…furry…for me, I think.” 

  


“That’s fine, you don’t have to want to fuck them.” May says. “You can like the way someone looks in a not-sexy way, that’s OK.”

  


“He’s, like, *with* Vincent, though, isn’t he? Like, it says stuff about him dating and shit but…” Rahal says. 

  


“I don’t know him anymore.” May says. “I have no idea. What about other stuff?”

  


“Didn’t he get arrested for environmental terrorism or something?” Rahal asks. 

  


“That was a long time ago, and he didn’t get arrested.” May says. “He got questioned because he was in the wrong place at the right time.”

  


“I thought Vincent had to sell his ship to bail him out.” Rahal says. 

  


“Nah, they got rid of it because it was costing them an arm and a leg to maintain. Those things look great but break down all the time, and you have to get them fixed at a dealer.” May says. “I was there for that.”

  


“Security to Deck 12 for a…disturbance.” The dispatch comes in, stopping their conversation. “126 and Oak.”

  


Deck 12 is lower rent civilian shopping, and designed to look like a street with storefronts. The ceiling is made of video panels, theoretically they’re supposed to show a view of a sky but the powers that be like to play random but aesthetic footage. Right now, it’s a mass of pink jellyfish. A group of people have gathered in front of two businesses, they can hear female voices shouting at each other, presumably the owners of said businesses. One is a pet store, the other sells herbal remedies. 

  


“Arrest her!” The pet store owner screams when she sees the officers. “She’s killing my babies!”

  


“Ma’am…” May says. 

  


“She’s crazy!” The other woman shouts. “The smell of imitation chocolate can not poison her dogs!”

  


“What about the other stuff! It’s toxic to animals! Your tea is killing my fish!” Pet Store lady screams. 

  


“Are you dumping it in the tank?” Tea Lady retorts. 

  


“Y’all…” May groans. 

  


“She has to move!” Pet Store Lady insists. 

  


“You move!” Tea Lady snaps back. 

  


“How many of your animals are dead?” May asks. 

  


“Well, none yet but…” Pet Store Lady admits. 

  


“And you’ve both been here how long?” May asks. 

  


“Five years, but…” Pet Shop Lady says. 

  


“So, you want me to arrest her for not killing your animals for five years?” May asks. “I’m confused.”

  


“The fumes are bad for them!” Pet Shop Lady says. 

  


“So, you have veterinary documents for their health issues?” May asks. 

  


“I don’t sell animals with health issues!” Pet Shop Lady says, affronted. 

  


“Ah, so you put them down.” May says. “Do you have the reports on hand, or does Millie still have them down in the morgue?”

  


“That’s disgusting!” Pet Shop Lady says. “My animals are all in excellent health, I don’t need to have them euthanized.”

  


“So, there is literally no problem here aside from you don’t like the way it smells.” May says. 

  


“I’m allergic to-” Pet Shop Lady starts. 

  


“Stop.” May says. “If you’re having medical issues, go to the hospital. Otherwise, deal with it.”

  


May turns to Tea Shop Lady. “Do you have anything in there that would hurt her animals?” 

  


“I suppose coffee isn’t good for them.” Tea Shop Lady says. “But it’s never hurt any of mine.”

  


“No peppermint oil or anything?” May asks. 

  


“The Marasats don’t like it.” Tea Shop Lady says. 

  


“You burn incense?” May asks. 

  


“Certainly not.” Tea Shop Lady says. 

  


“Ok, I’m gonna give the two of you a choice. There’s an empty store two blocks down. Either you figure out how to get along here, or one of you is moving. I’m gonna give you a few days to decide between yourselves, but if I hear anything else about this I’m gonna flip a coin and the loser relocates. You don’t like that, I’m gonna ticket both of you for disorderly.” 

  


The women grudgingly go back into their respective businesses. The crowd seems to agree overall with the tea shop owner, some follow her but none of them go into the pet store. A drone that had been circling flies away in search of something else interesting. 

  


They get called over to the commercial shuttle area, where May has to explain that a llama is not “carry on” and would at the very least need it’s own ticket. Then to deck 9, where Kevin and Brittany are duking it out yet again. 

  


“Holy fuck, you guys, just get a divorce!” May shouts as she and Rahal approach. 

  


This place is supposed to look like a subdivision, which means the houses have individual roofs with the ceiling above them. The video panels here are showing an actual sky right now, a red sunset with golden clouds. Brittany is on the roof, looking very dramatic against the backdrop. 

  


“Look, baby, I told you, I didn’t let her borrow it, she-” Kevin dodges a shoe. “Stole it.”

  


“Who stole what?” May asks. 

  


“Monica took my Roamer.” Kevin says. 

  


“Did you file a report?” May asks. 

  


“Not yet, it just happened like thirty minutes ago. That’s why I’m late.” He raises his voice and directs the last part at Brittany. 

  


“ISTC dispatch, we have a report of an accident. Ship has impacted the station in quadrant 847, no injuries reported. Pilot appears intoxicated.” The voice comes in through May and Rahal’s radios. 

  


May puts a finger against her ear, a visual cue that she’s activated her radio and isn’t talking at nothing. “Dispatch, can you give me the make and model of that ship and the driver’s name?” 

  


“DelMade Roamer, model f38. Pilot is Monica Fremmel.” Dispatch responds. 

  


“Well, she just crashed your ship.” May says to Kevin. 

  


“Shit, no! I just paid it off!” Kevin wails. 

  


“Put in a claim with ISTC. They’ll cover stolen vehicles here.” May says. “You can probably get a pretty decent payout if you include pain and suffering. I’ll say you and Brittany both appear distressed.” 

  


Brittany climbs down from the roof and comes up to comfort her husband. They go back into the house together, May makes a rude hand gesture after they’ve closed the door. 

  


“You ever just want to smack someone?” May asks. 

  


“All the time.” Rahal says. “Don’t you get tired of this?”

  


May shrugs. “It’s not all I do, you know.”

  


“Yeah, you sit around and watch security video and read passenger manifests and shit.” Rahal says. 

  


“Yep.” May says. “I am a nosy bitch.”

  


“Are you, like, investigating Dusty or something?” Rahal asks. “Did he do something?”



“No.” May says. “Well, ISTC doesn’t give a shit about him, anyway, he’s a little janky sometimes but not like that. Maybe if he was, like, seriously interstellar, but just here and the surface? Nah, just the normal shit.”

  


“So, you’re just watching videos and stuff for entertainment? I thought you didn’t like their music.” Rahal says. 

  


“I didn’t say that.” May says. “Their music is fine.”

  


“You like it.” Rahal says. 

  


“Fine, yes, are you happy now?” May rolls her eyes. 

  


She does actually like the music, that’s true. And she does like watching him on stage, they put on a good show. But now, Falcron seems to keep nudging him into her awareness again, band posters on the walls, music in a random store, reminding her to talk to the dancers at a time when she wouldn’t be able to help but see him in Mango. There’s also the matter of those sky rats that also seem to be infesting his home and apparently following him around.

1q0uczl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1q0uczl/i_lost_the_love_of_my_life_over_a_rock_i_have_to/,I lost the love of my life over a rock. I have to tell someone.,"I (M 32) have been with my girlfriend (F 27) for just over a year. From the very beginning of our relationship, she knew that climbing was a huge part of my life. About a month after we started dating, I went to Nepal to attempt Everest Base Camp, which I considered my first “real” climb. She initially mentioned coming, but it wasn’t a question of ability my expedition was already fully booked. These trips are planned months in advance.



About 5–6 months ago, I mentioned I wanted to climb Kilimanjaro. At first, she seemed mostly indifferent but still supportive. One night though, she was quiet and clearly upset. I asked her to talk to me, and she admitted she felt left out and that I spent a lot of my free time training, climbing, or hiking with friends.



So I invited her to come hiking with us.



She initially declined, then changed her mind. We bought her some basic climbing gear, and over the next few weeks, she actually did really well. She came on hikes regularly, bonded with some of my friends’ partners, and genuinely seemed to enjoy it. Things felt really good between us.



Then one day, after a climb, we were all sitting around having coffee and talking about our upcoming Kilimanjaro trip. One of my friend’s partners casually asked her, “Oh, you’re coming too, right?”



The silence was deafening.



She looked straight at me. The kind of look that says “Well?” And instead of being honest in that moment, I panicked. I didn’t want to embarrass her in front of everyone. So I said, “Yeah, of course.”



Everyone got excited, and we went home shortly after.



On the drive home, she was buzzing. Meanwhile, my stomach was in knots. The route we had planned, the Umbwe Route is not beginner-friendly. It’s steep, technical, and fast (5–6 days vs. 9–10 for beginner routes). For her to have the best chance, the entire group of 13 people would’ve had to switch to a longer, easier route. I already knew that wouldn’t happen.



Later that night, I sat her down and explained everything. That Kilimanjaro isn’t “easy,” that she’d only been training for a few weeks, and that while it was doable, it would take serious commitment, training, conditioning, even diet.



She said she was all in.



So we trained. Harder hikes. Actual climbing. Multi-day hikes with overnight camps and sunrise summits. And honestly… I’ve never been more in love with her before. Watching her push herself, seeing her determination. It was incredible. I supported her completely.



I even bought an engagement ring. I planned to propose on the summit of KJ.



Before the trip, I had a serious conversation with her. I told her she might not summit, not because she wasn’t capable, but because altitude sickness, injury, or exhaustion are real risks. I promised that if she couldn’t continue, I’d come back with her and we’d try again another time.



Then she asked me something I didn’t expect:



“If that happens… would you still summit without me?”



I hesitated, but I was honest. I said yes that this climb meant a lot to me. She told me she understood and didn’t want me to resent her or miss out on a lifelong goal.



We took the Umbwe Route.



After the first day, she was completely exhausted. The altitude was hitting her hard. She had shin splints. I could see her fighting tears, but she pushed on. The entire group rallied around her cheering her on, motivating her. Everyone genuinely wanted her to succeed.



That night, one of the guides pulled me aside with two friends and one of their partners. They were concerned for her safety. We were only one day up, and medically, this was the best time for her to descend. Continuing with shin splints could cause fractures.



I got defensive. I said she’d be devastated and that I believed in her.



The guide calmly said it was her decision but that I should talk to her.



When I did, everything exploded.



She accused me of always doubting her. Said she’d finish the climb just to prove me wrong. Then she rolled over and didn’t say another word.



The next morning, she was up before everyone dressed, ready to go. Even the guide was impressed.



We climbed less than 2km when I heard a scream that made my blood run cold.



She was sitting on the ground, sobbing. The pain from her shin splints had spread to her feet, especially her arches. She couldn’t go on.



I told her it was okay. Everyone surrounded her, hugged her, told her how proud they were. We agreed we’d come back and do it together another time.



Two of my friends and I helped her descend to camp, where she’d be escorted back to the base and then to a hotel.



I kissed her goodbye and said, “I’ll see you in a couple of days. Rest up.”



Her face dropped.



“So you’re just leaving me alone in a hotel room?”



I reminded her of our conversation where she said she was okay with me continuing.



She said she only said that because she didn’t think it would actually happen. That it was either her or the climb.



At that point… something broke in me. It wasn’t about choosing a mountain over her. It was about her telling me what she thought I wanted to hear and then changing it once reality hit.



So I told her I loved her. I apologized. And I said I had to finish the climb.



At the summit, everyone celebrated.



I cried.



I stood there holding the engagement ring I planned to give her, realizing exactly what I’d lost.



She never answered my calls or texts.



When we got back, she was gone. She blocked me everywhere. As far as I know, we’re done.



I lost the love of my life over a giant rock that wasn’t going anywhere.



Now I don’t even want to climb anymore. Every hike just reminds me of her.



I climbed a mountain and completed a goal of mine.



And I hate myself for it.",192,1767237202.0,TrueOffMyChest,104,0.82,False

Being 33 I am starting to dread the daunting task of staying up all the way until midnight for new years. This year I thought I could just drink coffee along with my alcohol to get me over the finish line. I don't normally drink coffee. We arrived at my friend's house at around 6pm. Already yawning and a few drinks deep, I asked my friend for a coffee. He asked if an espresso was fine and I said yes. At around 8pm, I felt more awake but thought one more would really perk me up, so I had another one. At around 11pm, caught up in the excitement of the night, I thought one more would see me over the finish line and the car ride home (girlfriend driving) and into a nice sleep at around 1:30am after getting home and showering. It is now 2pm AEST and I am still wide awake. I wish I was joking. I have been awake since 7am on Tuesday. That is 49 hours. I am wide awake now and probably won't sleep until tonight (another 8 hours or so). I know the half-life of caffeine would mean it's out of my system by now, but I think I'm too far into the day now and wide awake. I have not slept this year. Send help.

1q0ub5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelFanStory/comments/1q0ub5v/the_accelerator_faster_than_light/,The Accelerator — Faster Than Light,"The feather drifted like a promise and a curse.

It shimmered high above the city, glowing with impossible colors as the super mutant X-gene known as **the Catalyst** continued to evolve—its fragments spreading across the world, rewriting the rules of biology, physics, and destiny itself.

And somewhere beyond the horizon, moving faster than sound, faster than thought…

**Daniyah Daniels was disappearing.**

# Chapter One: Beyond the Horizon

Central City’s skyline trembled.

Windows rattled. Sirens wailed. The air itself screamed as a blue-and-silver streak tore through the streets, curving around buildings, vanishing and reappearing like lightning given purpose.

Inside that streak was **Dash Dynamo**—the hero once known as the fastest being alive.

But not anymore.

Daniyah felt it first in her chest.

*Something’s wrong… or right.*

Her heart pounded—not from exertion, but from *expansion*. The world slowed until raindrops hung frozen in midair, glistening like diamonds.

She skidded to a halt on the edge of the harbor, sneakers smoking.

“No,” she whispered. “I didn’t slow down.”

She looked around.

The world had failed to keep up with **her**.

Her comm crackled to life.

“Dash, you okay?” a familiar voice asked. **Monica Rambeau**, hovering above the bay in a glow of photon energy. “You vanished from every sensor. Even Stark’s satellites lost you.”

Daniyah blinked.

“I didn’t vanish,” she said slowly. “I… outran them.”

# Chapter Two: The Feather Awakens

That night, Daniyah couldn’t sleep.

Every time she closed her eyes, she *moved*.

Not physically—but mentally—slipping forward, backward, sideways through moments she hadn’t lived yet.

She bolted upright in bed, gasping.

Her room shimmered.

Then fractured.

Suddenly, she was standing in the same room—but older. Her suit lay folded on a chair nearby, redesigned, glowing faintly blue.

A mirror caught her attention.

Her reflection smiled before she did.

“You finally caught up,” the future Daniyah said.

Daniyah stumbled back. “Okay. Nope. This is new.”

Future Daniyah crossed her arms. “The Catalyst feather didn’t just make you faster. It removed your speed limit.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means velocity no longer applies to you the way it does to everyone else.”

A pause.

Then softly: “You’re faster than light now.”

The room snapped back to normal.

Daniyah collapsed onto her bed, breathing hard.

“Faster than light…” she whispered.

# Chapter Three: The Accelerator Is Born

Two days later, deep beneath Avengers Tower, Daniyah stood inside a Stark-designed containment chamber.

Tony Stark’s hologram flickered to life.

“Kid,” Tony said, rubbing his temples, “you broke causality. Do you have *any* idea how annoying that is to explain on a whiteboard?”

Bruce Banner adjusted his glasses, staring at the readouts. “She isn’t just moving fast. She’s phasing through time itself.”

Monica hovered nearby. “You mean like the Blur?”

Bruce shook his head. “No. The Blur bends time.”

He looked at Daniyah.

“She outruns it.”

Daniyah clenched her fists. “So what am I supposed to do? Stop running?”

Tony laughed humorlessly. “That ship sailed when you crossed three centuries and came back before my coffee cooled.”

Daniyah took a breath.

“I need a new suit.”

Hours later, she stepped out wearing it.

A sleek, radiant blue suit traced with living energy lines, humming softly like a restrained storm. The emblem on her chest resembled a streak splitting a star.

Tony whistled. “Well, damn. You look like physics filed a restraining order.”

Daniyah smiled.

“I’m not Dash Dynamo anymore.”

She pulled on her mask.

“I’m **The Accelerator**.”

# Chapter Four: Faster Than Light

Her first test wasn’t planned.

A cosmic rupture tore open above Earth—a fracture caused by Catalyst instability, threatening to erase an entire city before the Avengers could respond.

Doctor Strange opened a portal, urgency in his voice. “The collapse will happen in three seconds!”

Daniyah stepped forward.

“No,” she said calmly. “It won’t.”

She ran.

Not across space—

But *through time*.

She passed photons frozen like glass. She passed sound waves still waiting to be born. She outran the explosion before it existed, reaching the fracture at the exact moment it *decided* to happen.

She touched it.

And kept running.

The rupture unraveled behind her, undone before it could be real.

She skidded to a stop back beside the Avengers.

Only a fraction of a second had passed.

Thor stared at her, stunned. “By the stars… she moved before the moment.”

Doctor Strange lowered his hands slowly. “She didn’t just save us.”

“She edited reality.”

# Chapter Five: The Fastest Being Alive

Later, on a quiet rooftop, Daniyah stood alone, watching the city glow.

Monica landed beside her.

“You okay?” she asked.

Daniyah nodded. “I think so. It’s just… everything feels slow now.”

Monica smiled softly. “That doesn’t mean you have to leave us behind.”

Daniyah looked at her hands, crackling faintly with blue light.

“I can hear tomorrow coming,” she said. “I can see yesterday fading. But I choose *now*.”

She turned, determination blazing.

“Ready,” she said.

A pause.

“Set.”

The air vibrated.

“**Accelerate.**”

She vanished in a flash of blue light, streaking across the sky—past satellites, past stars, past the very edge of known speed.

And somewhere in the vast tapestry of time, legends began to change.

Because now—

She was faster than The Blur.  
Faster than light.  
Faster than destiny itself.

1q0uaoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishLearning/comments/1q0uaoe/daily_studying_routine/,Daily studying routine?,"Hello,

I just decided to start learning Spanish. I was going to learn French but ultimately chose to go back to Spanish after realizing I was a lot more comfortable with the language and I liked speaking it. I would like to establish a daily studying routine that will get me to (maybe) A2 by the end of the year. I can have incredibly basic interactions, but I would still classify myself as pre-A1. My goal was B2 by the end of 2028 but I was told it wasn’t possible unless I studied a very long time every day? I thought it was an achievable goal, but let me know what you guys think.

Here are things I would like to incorporate into a daily studying routine:

\- Spanish YouTube videos and/or podcasts (podcasts once I understand more… except, like, coffee break Spanish since they speak English too)

\- A Spanish workbook (I’m planning on picking one up at a store tomorrow or soon)

\- A language learning app (preferably free, I’m still deciding if I want to pay for an app subscription)

\- Potentially other things people recommend I add

I still have classes, other hobbies & spend a lot of time with my recently adopted puppy. I have some time to dedicate to studying but I don’t want to go too over the top since I’m someone who gets burnt out easily.

Any advice would be helpful! I’m new to this and only have experience in 2 classes of public school Spanish which I didn’t retain much from. Thank you! feliz año nuevo!",1,1767236986.0,SpanishLearning,4,1.0,False

1q0u92u,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/1q0u92u/does_this_seem_like_a_twin_flame_connection/,Does this seem like a twin flame connection?,"2.5 years ago a new person joined my company. I was curious to meet him because his CV was astonishing: elite schools, perfect grades and test scores, top-tier companies. On his first day, he surprised me by coming to my office to introduce himself. He was very guarded and stoic, shook my hand, said a few pleasantries, and quickly left. He immediately got under my skin even from the brief interaction. I felt so much energy pass between us when he shook my hand that I felt physically uncomfortable. 

After that, he actively avoided me for 2.5 years. If we entered a stairwell together, he’d hold the door, I’d say thank you, and he’d say nothing and bolt down the stairs. If the only open seat in a meeting was next to me, he’d stand on the other side of the room. He never once said hello to me, even at social events. I eventually took offense and assumed he was an elitist or a racist (I'm not white). But he would speak to the other staff, which includes minorities, just never me. If we ever were accidentally close to each other, I would feel that same destabilizing energy.

For context, in our industry it’s heavily frowned upon for people in his role and people in mine to date. He’s senior, so there are serious ethical and reputational risks for him. This comes into play later.

This December, two things happened in rapid succession that changed everything. My boss called me the day after a meeting and said ""is something going on between you and [his name]"" and I said ""wtf I don't exist to him, how can you ask me that??"" And she said she saw him staring at me throughout the whole meeting. That was the first moment it clicked that he is attracted to me and has avoided me for years because he didn't want to cross a line at work.

Then we had our annual holiday party, and towards the end, he finally approached me!!! I was so shocked I don't remember what he said. I came back online when I realized he was laughing and I was teasing him about blocking me in the group photo and suggesting he make his hair even taller for next year to better block people. The look on his face was pure joy. I had never seen him genuinely smile or laugh before at work (I don't think anyone has, and he has a reputation for being an ice man). The chemistry felt electric and oddly familiar, like we’d known each other for years. Later I marvelled that I teased an executive about his HAIR in our first real conversation.

Since then, we’ve met one-on-one under a flimsy work pretext that I suggested, which he enthusiastically agreed to. He then created another excuse to meet privately again. We've been getting to know each other that way, and the vibe feels so good. The attraction is 11/10 on all levels, physically, emotionally, and energetically. We were instant friends. We've now scheduled another meeting, and his email wording has shifted from work-focused to “let’s definitely chat soon over coffee!""

Despite how nice this feels, it doesn’t feel simple. He’s brilliant but complicated. He’s in a senior role at my company and also on the C-suite of his own (he alternates every other week). He’s an extreme workaholic and hasn’t had a partner in years. I suspect he has avoidant attachment - which I do as well, but I've moved my style to secure and I'm capable of having a loving relationship as long as I get lots of space. My life has been more focused on my inner world and spirituality. I do well professionally, but I’m not in the same universe of material achievement as him. He’s very cautious about optics and is moving very slowly.

Just because baristas are baristas does not mean they are NPCs you get to treat badly and disrespectfully.

Anyway back to the topic. Excuse me, I’ve worked 8 hours today and I’m tired.

I hate to say it, but there’s no ranking system in Starbucks. Your order isn’t prioritized because you have a baby with you, or because you’re the wife to a CEO or the president or something. In Starbucks, the only “ranking” that exists is the order in which you’ve placed your order, so please respect that chain coffee shops often include waiting periods and that it is often not the fault of the baristas if you have to wait 10+ minutes.",15,1767236143.0,starbucks,4,0.8,False

I’m looking for perspective, especially from men around my age (late 20s / early 30s), ideally based in the US or Arizona.

I’m currently visiting Arizona for about three weeks. I’m Latino, fit, well-groomed, and fairly social. People often tell me I look good, and in person I usually don’t struggle starting conversations. I dance (bachata/salsa), which also helps in social settings.

I meet women both in real life (dance socials) and through dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Badoo, and Facebook Dating.

The confusing part is the pattern I keep experiencing.

It usually goes like this:

	•	Good conversation and clear interest (in person or via apps)

	•	We exchange Instagram or Snapchat

	•	Sometimes we even discuss concrete plans (gym, coffee, dancing, practicing together)

	•	Then suddenly… no response / ghosting

This has happened multiple times, including with women who seemed genuinely engaged and responsive at first. No arguments, no pressure, no awkward moments that I’m aware of — just sudden disengagement.

I’m not angry or blaming women. I’m genuinely trying to understand the dating landscape here.

So I’m wondering:

	•	Is this kind of ghosting and lack of follow-through just normal dating culture in the US right now?

	•	Is the dating market especially competitive or saturated?

	•	Does being a short-term visitor automatically lower interest, even if the connection is good?

	•	Or is there something subtle I might be doing wrong culturally or socially?

I’d really appreciate hearing from other men — locals or visitors — who’ve experienced something similar, especially those who do relatively well initially but struggle with consistency afterward.

Thanks in advance for any honest perspectives.",1,1767235629.0,dating_advice,9,1.0,False

My dream growing up was always hosting a large outdoor BBQ party, with me taking charge of the BBQ Grill ensuring everything is cooked perfectly, while you would be the classy host who would ensure everyone is comfy. Our pet dog would constantly try to steal a chicken leg from our grill 😅

I do enjoy reading Classic books, going for long strolls during sunset and trying out new adventures during weekends ( pottery, coffee making, Pilates, wall climbing etc )

I work in startup investing and also help out my parents ice cream shop at nights. ( I know how to make the best sundae ! ) 

  
Bonus points if you also felt alone while surrounded by people and are looking for the best buddy you can still laugh with even when are both 80 years old haha
