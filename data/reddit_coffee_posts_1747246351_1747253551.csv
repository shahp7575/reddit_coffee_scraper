1kmp5tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackgirls/comments/1kmp5tp/confusion_regarding_my_co_worker/,Confusion regarding my co worker,"I (19f) started working at a restaurant in march. On my first day I saw a guy (21m) . He’s tall and handsome.  I thought „damn“ and I was immediately attracted to him. Fun part is we’re from the same country (he’s mixed)and he was just very extroverted and I developed a silly work crush on him. Nothing serious. 

One day at work I was told to clean something but he did it for me. The restaurant was empty to he asked me to sit outside with the others and gave me his jacket and I remember I flinched but then I realised it was him fixing it for me. And he didn’t wear one. He made sure I got free food when I got home too. 

And he taught me how to make coffee and how to pour beer even tho he’s a waiter and I’m a bartender and one time he was holding my hand when I held the glass and we both poured it in and I let him bc why not? I have a friend who knows a guy that’s knows him and she asked him if he was single and the guy said no. He’s not a relationship type. So I thought it was my time to plot😭

Anyways he kept encouraging me at work and a few weeks ago he asked me to do his hair for his birthday. Mind you I’ve never claimed to be a stylist. I’ve never done hair in front of him before and we have a black cook and another black bartender and I was asking myself why he didn’t ask them. And the bartender and I talked about stuff and she told me he has a gf that’s also mixed and I was confused bc he never acted like anyone who had a gf. 

I went with him to do his hair at his friends place. We talked a lot and I told him I’ll go to a summer festival with my friend and he told me about his time there and how his woman was calling his phone 24/7. That’s how I found out he had a gf. Thank god this wasn’t a serious crush but still. And he suggested I got to a festival in France bc ill deffo meet my type there😭😭 idk why he said that. But he didn’t make me feel excluded. I didn’t want money from him bc he’s my co worker and we good. So no? And I’m not a pro. He said I should do hair fr and even rated it a 10 for it being my first time. All his friends said it’s clean and good. And he said he’ll definetly come again and that he can help me do this fr. I asked him why he wanted me to do it bc he’s never seen me do anything. He said even the cook suggested to do it for him and that he has like 5 hairstylists bc he does his hair all the time (he does) but he gages who is free and when he thought about it  I was the most reliable one???? I don’t understand 

He invited me to his birthday this Friday and took us out to eat (wit his friends) and even then he was glancing at me every now and then. Mind you the whole crush thing disappeared bc I don’t go for taken people ofc and he was actually pretty cool. So were his friends. He wanted me to stay longer bc he wanted to get birthday stuff and go to a bar at night but I left earlier. I wanted to know the details for the birthday bc I wanted to go with a friend and it’s another friends birthday that same day. I wished him happy b day on Monday he said thank you and then I asked if he could give me the details and he hasn’t responded til now. I thought it’s bc he’s busy but today another friend worked with him and she told me he took down the hair. It might have not lasted that long bc I didn’t cake up his hair with gel but I think that’s the reason he didn’t respond. 

I’m not saying that he wanted anything from me but I’m asking myself if it was really about the hair??? I was just excited for the birthday party bc I missed being under black spaces but I don’t understand the whole thing ",1,1747253409.0,blackgirls,0,1.0,False

**hdfidelity presents**     
     
### **SERIES FINALE: *The Road to Newark***  
**Episode Title:** *“Showcase Showdown”*  
**Structure:** Interweaving Threads A, B, and C in a single convergence—two tanks, two crews, one absurdly overblown arrival.  
**Tone:** Burn After Reading meets Dr. Strangelove meets *Blues Brothers*, with a sliver of redemption and a healthy dose of chaos.  
**Length:** Feature-length special (split into acts below).  

---

## **ACT I: “Where the Hell Did That Tank Come From?”**

**EXT. INTERSTATE 95 – DAWN**

The Delaware Turnpike was not designed for glory.

But on this morning, two tanks—one official and one unauthorized, duct-taped and divine—were converging on Newark, Delaware, from opposite ends of the horizon.

Lt. Rico and Sgt. Slick (Thread A), after months of U-turns, diner detours, and pie judging, had finally recalibrated their nav system thanks to a goat who *headbutted it in just the right spot*.

Lt. Skidmark, Sgt. Rogers, and Pvt. Bunker (Thread B), fresh off a harrowing escape from a subterranean militia-themed mini golf course, were riding high on adrenaline and exactly **3% battery life**.

---

## **ACT II: THE LOW-PROFILE ENEMY: WILFRED CABLETON, LOBBYIST**

**INT. NEWARK CITY COUNCIL BUILDING – EARLY MORNING**

Wilfred Cableton—low-profile, high-functioning military lobbyist—adjusted his tie as he reviewed a quietly devastating budget memo. If the prototype showcase succeeded, funding for his **privately-backed drone swarm initiative** would be cut.

He sipped lukewarm coffee. Smiled coldly.

Outside the building: a **giant, inflatable blimp** reading “FUTURE OF COMBAT: ARRIVING TODAY.”

Cableton made one call:  
> “Deploy the rail interceptors. And initiate narrative suppression protocols. Blame it on software.”

---

**EXT. RAILWAY OVERPASS – SAME TIME**

Rico and Slick’s tank rumbled beneath the overpass when the train—unmarked, rapid, and suspiciously full of moving parts—cut across the road.

A high-pitched whine sounded. Two drone-pods deployed like bees from hell.

Slick slammed the yoke. Rico opened the side hatch and aimed the “Crowd Calmer” cannon. He fired a net—standard issue—and caught **one drone mid-hover**, which *electrocuted itself on impact* with the tank’s chassis.

The other one? **Flew straight into an overhead power line**. Exploded like a microwave full of fireworks.

Rico blinked.

“Did we just win by doing *nothing*?”

Slick: “We were *due*.”

---

## **ACT III: THE HIGH-PROFILE ENEMY – THE GENERAL**

**INT. SHOWCASE FIELD – 10AM**

General DuMont was a career spectacle—a man of medals, menace, and a mustache shaped like a power structure. He stood before a waiting press line and unveiled… nothing.

No tank. No fanfare. Just a cheap banner that read **“INNOVATE TOMORROW”** and a complimentary granola bar station.

Lt. Pilgrim whispered: “Sir, we might have a problem.”

DuMont turned. “Define problem.”

Pilgrim pointed.

**Down the field… both tanks were arriving.**

---

**EXT. SHOWCASE FIELD – CONTINUOUS**

Rico’s tank rolled in slow, noble, and triumphant… until the brakes failed and it **gently nudged the press riser**, sending reporters tumbling like bowling pins.

Seconds later, Skidmark’s tank burst through the side gate, **covered in flags, parade streamers, and a single goat**. The turret slowly turned to face DuMont’s podium.

For a full ten seconds, there was only the sound of confused mooing.

Then the onboard speaker crackled:  
> “*Showcase mode engaged.*”

Bunker had hit something again.

A *blaring, military-patriotic synth remix of “Take Me Home, Country Roads”* blasted through Newark.

---

## **ACT IV: THE UNVEILING**

**INT. CONTROL TENT – LATER**

Brogan was sweating through his third shirt of the day. He watched the tanks parked side by side, one spotless and sterile, the other haphazard and glorious.

A Pentagon observer leaned in. “So which one was the official prototype?”

Brogan sipped bourbon from a flask disguised as a monocle case.

“…Define official.”

---

**EXT. SHOWCASE FIELD – LATER**

In front of the tanks, Rico and Skidmark met for the first time.

Both men were silent.

Rico finally said, “You brought a goat.”

Skidmark nodded. “You hit a news van.”

They shook hands.

Behind them, Slick (A) and Slick (B) compared engine schematics while Bunker offered the goat a granola bar.

---

## **FINAL SCENE: DEPARTURE**

The showcase ended. Photos were taken. Brogan gave a speech that sounded like it was written by a confused AI and three underpaid interns.

Both tanks were loaded onto flatbeds. The crews stood nearby, uniforms wrinkled, expressions somewhere between triumph and disbelief.

Rico: “You think they’ll actually fund these things?”

Skidmark: “No. But I think they’ll fund the goat.”

Slick A: “Where are they sending us next?”

Slick B: “Hopefully not Maryland.”

Rico: ""So, what name did you take to calling 'em?""

Bunker: “We named him Sherman.”

Rico raised an eyebrow.

“The goat,” Bunker clarified.

They all nodded.

Fade to black.

1kmp3pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigGirlDiary/comments/1kmp3pw/51425_soft_rituals_sharp_reminders/,"5.14.25: ""Soft Rituals, Sharp Reminders""","I used to think healing was this grand, dramatic thing - a sudden revelation, a perfect version of myself waiting on the other side. But it’s not. It’s quieter, rawer - a slow crawl out of chaos, one small ritual at a time.

There was a time I went out almost every night. Neon lights bleeding across wet pavement, strangers’ hands gripping too tight, loud music I drowned myself in just to avoid the silence. I thought I needed that rush - the heat, the chaos, the prickling burn of vodka sliding down my throat. I told myself it was freedom. But I was just running, always running.

Now? Most nights, I don’t even touch alcohol. I light candles instead - soft, warm light radiating across the room. If it’s cold, I bury myself under a heated blanket, letting the warmth sink into the ache I can’t always name. I don’t remember the last time I stood beneath club lights, let some stranger’s touch blur the edges of who I was. 

Sometimes I miss it - the thrill, the escape. But I know now it was just another way of disappearing.

Mornings are different now. I wake up, make myself an iced coffee - cold enough to jolt me awake, bitter enough to remind me I’m here. I set *Amy Winehouse’s Back to Black* spinning, the needle catching for just a second before her voice floods the room - smoky, bruised, and too honest. Even when it’s freezing, I push the window open, the cold slamming against my skin, cutting and clean. It’s a reminder - the world keeps turning, even when I’m stuck, even when I can’t feel anything. 

My skincare routine has become a quiet ritual - a kind of softness I give myself when everything else feels too sharp. Korean sheet masks that cling to my skin, serums that sink in cool and soothing. It’s not just about looking good - it’s about feeling something tender, something gentle, in a world that’s always too much… 

And when the quiet stretches too long, I write - pages and pages, words I won’t let anyone else see. Or I scroll Pinterest, losing myself in a world of soft colors, quiet corners, little pieces of a life I’m still trying to build.

I’m just starting to post on social media again after deleting all of mine. For a while, it felt like I didn’t have anything worth sharing. Like I was this contradiction - too soft, too intense, too unfiltered to fit into neat squares on a screen. But I’m starting to realize healing isn’t about becoming someone else - it’s about learning to stay. Even when it’s uncomfortable. Even when it’s lonely.

If you’re caught in that strange, in-between place - learning who you are all over again - you’re not alone. Healing isn’t some revelation. Sometimes it’s just letting the cold air sting your skin, lighting a candle to push back the dark, and telling yourself you’re still here. 🌸

1kmp3kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1kmp3kp/design_my_appartment/,Design My appartment.,"Hi, I'm having a bit of trouble with my layout. I am to take over a new appartment in October and am in the planing stages. In this appartment, the top and bottom walls are essentially fully french windows, so full height windows. It offers a lot of light but also limits possibilities of where for example I can place a TV or PC due to light.

https://preview.redd.it/opf9ys081t0f1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecfa46f5ca24233b16b99fce196425303a49fd97

So, some of the things I would like to have in the apartment.

Bedroom:

\- Bed, 180x200  
\- Big Wardrobe  
\- TV in front of the bed  
\- Nightstand by at least one of the sides of the bed

Living Room/Kitchen/Dining

\- 4 man dining room, rectangle, obv with chairs haha  
\- Corner Couch with TV and a coffee table, round carpet under it  
\- Desk for work, big desk since I work in IT, will have to be 2 meters long

On another note, do you know if there is a service on fiverr where I can hire somebody, and then they do the whole design of my apartment based on my requirements? That means placing items on the layout, following feng shui principles, like creating zones with carpets and dividers, and then moody lighting aswell.  
And in the end they would provide me with the links to buy all the items. I would be willing to pay quite a bit for a service like this. The links they'd provide me with should be market specific to my country tho.",1,1747253255.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

The wind howled through the desolate mountain roads, brushing against the bare trees and sending their skeletal limbs creaking. The car trudged along the winding path, the tires groaning with every sharp turn. We had been driving for hours, the only signs of civilization long behind us. The GPS, once steady and guiding, had lost signal an hour ago. And now, we were nearly there.

The three of us — me, Ethan, and Lena — had been planning this trip for months. A getaway to escape the noise, the chaos of the city, to find peace. Or so we thought.

We were supposed to be heading to a remote cabin, tucked somewhere in these mountains, far from the reach of Wi-Fi signals, far from the endless notifications. A place to simply breathe.

Our coffees had long since cooled, and Ethan kept laughing at the thought of what might be waiting for us. “I bet it’s a haunted place, just wait,” he’d say, throwing his usual sarcastic grin our way.

Lena, ever the skeptic, would just shake her head. “Haunted or not, we’re getting a break from all the noise. That’s enough for me.”

The landscape around us began to shift, the road narrowing, and then, without warning, we found ourselves in front of a strange, almost eerie structure.

It wasn’t what I had expected. The so-called ""cabin"" was more like a crumbling bunker. One story, overgrown with ivy and moss, its windows broken and the metal door barely hanging on its hinges. It looked abandoned, the remnants of a forgotten place.

“This is where we’re staying?” Lena asked, her voice edged with disbelief.

Before I could respond, Ethan, always the daring one, was already out of the car and walking toward the entrance, grinning like a kid at Halloween. “Perfect. Looks like a secret base.”

I followed reluctantly, feeling a chill creeping down my spine. There was something off about this place. It was too quiet, too isolated. We stepped inside, our footsteps echoing in the hollow emptiness. The walls were covered in strange symbols, faded documents scattered across a desk, and a single old computer that seemed to be in better condition than the rest of the place.

But it wasn’t the disarray that made me uneasy. It was the sense of something hidden, something alive in this forsaken place.

We explored deeper into the building, finding more and more traces of an unsettling past. That’s when I stumbled upon it — a small metal door, tucked away behind a stack of old crates. It was half-open, revealing a narrow stairwell leading down into darkness.

“This is... this is not normal,” I muttered, looking back at Ethan and Lena, who had also gathered around.

Lena frowned. “What are we even looking at?”

Without answering, I stepped closer to the door, unable to resist the pull of curiosity. Ethan gave me an encouraging nod, and we descended into the dark abyss below.


---

What we discovered that night would change everything.
The underground base was far more than it appeared. Old computers hummed with strange energy, the walls marked with symbols and notes we couldn’t quite understand. It felt like we had stumbled upon something that had been hidden away for years — a government project, perhaps, or something darker.

As we explored, the air grew colder. A sense of danger settled over me, but I couldn’t turn back now.

And then, we found the files.


---

In one of the drawers, there was a folder. Its cover had been torn and re-taped several times. Written on it, in bold, was:
“PROJECT: FINAL CODE // STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL”
Beneath it, a name:
Dr. Aleksandr Orlov.


---

Just as we started to piece together what this place really was, a sound echoed from the shadows. Footsteps. Someone was here. Someone had been here.

We weren’t alone. And now, we were in deep.

There’s this girl 25F I worked with on the same project for the past two years. We hadn’t interacted much before, but recently we started talking more—mostly about work, switching jobs, and sometimes casual stuff too.

She asked for help updating her Naukri profile, and that’s actually the main reason we planned to meet at the office today. We had only seen each other once in person around 6 months ago during an annual office event. Other than that, I hadn’t seen her because she doesn’t have a display picture on Teams.

Whenever she needed help, I used to ask for her personal email to send study materials, but I never had the courage to ask for her number. One day she called me for work—I didn’t recognize the number, and that’s how we ended up officially exchanging numbers.

So today, I casually asked if she could come to the office to meet. She agreed—even though this office is closer to me and a bit inconvenient for her, she still made the effort to come, which I really appreciated. I got a bit late, but she still waited for me.

We chatted for a bit about how the project wrapped up nicely after all these years. Then we went for lunch—I asked her what she felt like eating and we went to a South Indian place. I paid for the food. After lunch, she stopped by a café and brought two cold coffees—her treat. That small gesture meant a lot.

She was quite talkative during lunch—sharing stories about her personal life, her friends, and more. I also talked a bit, but mostly I was just listening and enjoying the vibe.

We got back to the office and continued chatting for a while. Later in the evening, I asked her if she wanted tea—she said yes. She tried to pay this time but I insisted and paid. After that, we walked around 1.5 km to the bus station together, still talking. It felt really nice—she was just casually sharing her thoughts and stories, and even though I didn’t always know what to say, I was happy just being around her.

Since she came all the way to this office just because I asked, I even offered to book an Uber for her while we were leaving. I felt I should do something since she came all this way. But she politely refused, said there’s no need—she’ll manage and actually enjoys walking to the bus stop.

Right before we parted ways, I gave her a small chocolate and told her to take care. I also said a proper goodbye since we might not get to meet again—I’m leaving, and she’s still around, figuring out her next move. Later I texted her “Hey, did you reach?” and she replied, “Yes, just now.”

Now I’m honestly confused. I don’t know if we’re just friends or if there’s something more. In my 3.5 years of working, this is the first time I’ve spent this kind of time with a girl—talking, eating, walking—and it felt really good and meaningful.

I’m not sure if I have feelings yet, but she’s definitely a 10/10. Based on our conversations, I think she’s single, but I’m not 100% sure.

She is Green flag completely- She paid for food ,she waited for me, she put effort to reach ofc which is inconvenient for her, shes gave her time

So now I’m just wondering… how do I take this forward? Are we friends? Could it turn into something more? I’m not sure how to label this or what to do next.

I know it’s not a caffeine issue because I can drink energy drinks fine with no issue?

This meant instead of Red Bulls, I would drink straight coffee with primary just a little heavy cream. My life and career have always been on the busy side so I would consume around 3 cups of coffee a day on a normal basis, sometimes more. About 6 months to a year later I noticed I was getting sick and aching a lot. Now I was a boxer and amateur professional motocross racer when I was young so I figured it was just old age starting I creep up on me since I had been hard on my body. Again, long story short, it had gotten so bad and the multiple doctors couldn’t narrow it down to the point they labeled me rheumatoid arthritis. This was around COVID time period so it was difficult to see my doctors as regular as normal and I was having an issue trying to get my insurance to cover a medication one doctor wanted to administer. Because i was having a difficult time getting a sooner visit, I found another doctor in network who could see me a month sooner. By chance this doctor tried a variety of test and found the underlying issue. He has theories why my body can’t process coffee and the results of it but I’m trying to understand if anyone else has ever seen this issue before? It’s 100% an issue with coffee because my test results are normal if I abstain from drinking it. I’m yet to run into many people with the issue? ",1,1747253146.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I saw some coffee I had been dying to try which has just been released in my store. It’s the Nescafé Iced Coffee Concentrate.

I’d been wanting to get my hands on it for so long I put 3 bottles in my basket. The other items I purchased were just hand soap and tortillas.

I went to self check out, scanned my items and went to pay. All of a sudden, it flashes up with ‘Assitance Is Coming: Age Restricted Products’.

I was so confused for a moment as I hadn’t bought any alcohol or anything. 

I look at the items which I scanned and it said it was the coffee and it needed to verify I was over 16 to purchase?

Is this a new law or something?

1kmoyiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kmoyiw/my_notebooks_good_enough/,My notebook's good enough,"Poverty is about needing a notebook.  Just bound paper really, something to write in, for the personal project that's keeping you sane, in my case, recording cooking experiments, making my own hot sauces, growing my own peppers.  So you go online, and you spend 15 minutes, and you find it, the perfect notebook.  It's just what you'd pictured, it's got an index and a bookmark, a little pen holder, good quality, hardback.  But, it's $25.  25!  So, you spend an hour, two, looking things up.  There's a $15 one now that's almost perfect.  Payoff, for only an hour of your life.  Then you find a $10 one.  It's worse quality, it doesn't look quite as nice, but it's got most of what you wanted in it, maybe missing a few things.  You put it in your cart and sit on it for a week to think, put off your hobby.  

Then you buy a $2 college-ruled piece of crap for students when you see it, one day at the pharmacy, because that's all you really needed; some paper.

You were always going to buy the $2 one.  You knew it when you started.  You didn't spend two hours of research and a week of procrastinating to find the right notebook for your budget.  You did it because you wanted to imagine having something nice.  That for a moment you could let your guard down, and get something that made you simply happy.  Something as silly as a nice little notebook.  You did it because you dream of security.  Of having enough.  But even if you had the extra $15 dollars that week, you can't.  

Because where would it lead?  And why?  You don't have a nice pen to go with it.  You didn't buy the nicer ingredients you wanted, anyways.  You got the cheaper pots for the peppers, you got the seeds that weren't quite what you wanted, but would do.  What, really, would be the point, of gilding this long-dead lily, ailing from the start?  It's hard enough to justify even buying as much as you have, even if the whole project has cost you $80.  That's food for a month!  You can't let yourself inspect that, even start to think about it, when you're in this deep.

Then a friend, or a family member says hey, let me get that notebook for you.  I saw how much you wanted it.  You deserve nice things.  I love you.  Because they have enough, and they have enough to share.

But you can't let them do it.  You have hardened your heart, and you cannot let it crack.  Because when you see that little notebook, you'll think of the ikea table it's sitting on.  And the cracked cup next to it with the cheapest coffee you can buy.  And you'll feel the holes in the socks on your feet, and you'll feel the bottomless pit of fear and desperation in your soul you experience every time you set your sights on something good.  Knowing that you can't have it.  Knowing it'd be ripped away from you.  Knowing you'll have to leave it behind when your rent raises or you lose your shit job and you have to pack everything you own into your tiny car again and uproot your life.

You can't say all this to your friend, and they're just trying to be nice, to be helpful, to share their good fortune.  They don't know that having that notebook would make you cry.  They once lived like you, but they hit a lucky break, and they've forgotten what it's like to live in looming desperation.  They don't have the fear anymore.  So you say hey, that's okay.  My $2 notebook's good enough.

You do deserve nice things.  But you cannot dare to have them.",2,1747252907.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 19: A Brand New Order**

 

After they got moving again, Jack asked, “Is she still alive? Whirler. Whoever she was in real life.”

“Yep! Just super old. Totally retired. I think she’s a big gardener. Doesn’t involve herself anymore.”

“I like that some do that. I hope she’s happier now. Chromey seemed to get more somber later on, too. Like his real face left the joy with the mask. Same face, but… not.”

“I guess that’s what politics does. He stretched himself thin, being both a general and public liaison. His last few years were absent, though. He withdrew, though unofficially. Deteriorating health, I think.”

“It’s too bad. But everyone knows he was dedicated.”

“The public info is on target for once, there. He was more business-like in private. Intimidating without even trying. Always busy. But anyone you ask, I think they’d tell you he was a great guy.”

“Wish I could’ve met him.”

“Yeah,” Lindsay replied sympathetically. “I feel honored I got to. Took a picture, too!”

“Be sure to send it to me.”

“You bet!”

“Which was Chromey, by the way? A Mantle, I guess?”

“What? Oh! No, the first generations aren’t any of them. Didn’t exist. The second generation on, for the Halls. And back then, it was really small. Tiny. You’ll notice the photos of Whirler’s era aren’t too varied. Everybody knew each other back then.”

“Huh. Alright, then.”

They walked past more iconography, art, and enshrined items — *What is a teacup doing here?* — as it continued, apparently descending by generation. Jack eyed it, wondering just how many of the contributors were still alive, young or not.

*It’s a memorial for the older gens. Bright points of a life cut short. Felt all the deeper for their rarity, I imagine.*

Finally, the displays got sparse and then just ended, still with plenty of hallway left. Jack gave a brief chuckle. “Here’s where we come in, I guess?”

“Where *you* come in. It’s never too early to plan for it! After all, you’ll graduate in two shakes, won’t you?”

“Yes, I will. Let me guess — you have a huge section already filled for yourself in your neck of the hall?”

“You know me so well already, Jack! I’ll expect you to go and check it out, too. Soon.”

Jack laughed and shook his head. “As the taskmistress commands.”

The rest of the hallway was quite a walk, as if to say that many more generations were expected. Finally, a grand spill opened up, the walkway continuing on that minimal curve, but to their left was a huge pantomime of being ‘outside’ presented on a platform. A gold-brick path cut through a gentle earthen slope of perfectly cut grass and passed under many rows of flagstaffs. It looked like every participating faction of humanity was represented there. It led to a circular fountain with another statue of the titular figure of the place holding a guitar.

Beyond this, at the top of a slight hill, was a school grounds interspersed with shrubbery and trees. There was one building, three stories, rustic but stylized by an aesthetically precise architect. It was something like a manor house with two diagonally-flaring wings. It had stone supports but prominent wood paneling with a ‘southwestern’ feel. It could’ve been a ‘mayor’s mansion’ in a Western flick. But there was also a prominent decorative bell tower in the center, carefully cultivated to look like an Old World relic, giving it more of a scholastic feel.

A breeze could be felt, obviously from a hidden air current generation. At the moment, the grounds as a whole were rather impressively mood-lit and overall dark, but Jack was certain the great dome over the hill would spill bright, natural light in the morning.

“Well!” Jack exclaimed as he took it all in. “I was expecting something way more claustrophobic than this. It’s beautiful. Quaint.”

Lindsay sighed longingly. “Yeah, it sure is. I miss this so much. Arcadia is similar in layout, just more decorative and elegant. This is bare bones in comparison, but it’s nice enough. You gotta see ours sometime.”

“The list only gets longer of things you’ll make me see, huh?”

She flashed a smile back at him. “Damn right! Hey, it’s not every day I mentor a newbie, especially one who can appreciate things, and here I get to do it *on the job*! *Totally* going to show off everything.”

“How many students are here?”

“Seventy-four with you. It’s currently configured to house a hundred. Might expand in the coming years. Population growth is being tapered, but not hard-tapered. The numbers will continue to grow.”

They passed under the lightly blowing flags, the final four including the black coat symbol of the Linewalkers, the winged sun of Babylon, and the mushhushshu dragon of the Exemplars — the ‘Mems’ in general. Jack studied the last as the wind caught it, and it recalled to him the old motto. The supposed motto, anyway. It was chanted to him by a young man who was badly poisoned and was hysterically amused by a certain ‘irony’ contained in it.

*The head of a snake to gaze,*

*The legs of a lion to run,*

*The claws of an eagle to grasp,*

*And a scorpion stinger for fun!*

Jack had a faint, bittersweet grin. *Pretty damn badass, bud.*

The other flag of the four was the ‘Earth flag’ — whenever he saw it, it made him feel a certain way. Philosophical, maybe. The power of symbols. It showed the map of the world as it once was, with the continents whole and unwarped. When humanity covered the face of it and dominated with conventional technology — supposedly, even *beyond* the Earth, with satellites and stations in orbit. A moon base. The only ‘enemies’ were one faction’s rival or another’s. Somehow, they kept it together. Until the end, anyway.

Curiosity did the deed, according to legend. They poked where they shouldn’t in the exploration of ‘beyond’ and it poked back — much harder. Or like Icarus, their wings burnt up too up close and personal with it. Only, if so, the sun didn’t stop there, sending its burning further down. It wasn’t until civilization was underground and hanging by a thread that the survivors finally ‘massaged’ things correctly, by the examples of their enemies. Adaptation and reverse engineering, which produced Memoria. Almost too late, but not quite.

Icarus died, but new gods were born. Not only did they not hang up their wings, they flew higher than ever and harnessed their own fire in contention with the old gods.

*I guess it remains to be seen whether it's enough.*

They passed beyond the flags and angled around the fountain, avoiding the front entrance entirely, headed to the right, from Jack’s perspective.

“This is the Chess Wing, named for the tiles inside,” Lindsay declared. “Boys' rooms. You’re not *technically* banned from the Star Wing, which is the girls' area. In any case, we don’t do roommates. You have your own room and so does everyone else. Bathroom, too. The subway is underneath the school. If you’re the only one taking it, don’t sweat it, that’s perfectly fine. It’s made to handle a lot or a little. It leaves seven minutes after noon on class days for the mess hall. Noon is the only time you’ll hear that bell outside of special events. Most people go for a provided lunch credit. Dinner is your own business, but you can go there. Pretty popular for that, too. It’s like a food court, I guess? Variety. Some places are always open.”

At the far end of the wing, they approached some big, wooden double doors in between orderly hedge rows. Jack saw a curtain from a window flash with movement before the angle blocked the view.

*My arrival has been noted.*

“Any division to cadets with the stories, here?” Jack asked.

“Yeah, the younger ones are usually up top, older at the bottom, and meeting in the middle by age. Hypothetically. Some refuse to move for status. Unsurprisingly, you’ve got a floor-level room.”

“Right.” As they approached closer to the door, Jack saw it had an old-school handle to pull out, so he rushed over to get it before the quick-paced Lindsay did.

Lindsay was amused as she walked through. “Old-fashioned, are we?”

“Blame my upbringing. Not that you mind.” He followed after her into a more temperature-controlled hallway, dimly but functionally lit from above, with rows of doors quickly evident to either side.

“Did you read my body language for that determination, Jack?”

“I did, yeah. Partially.”

She glanced back at him. “And the rest is assuming I don’t mind being pandered to, being a pampered woman of fine tastes?”

Jack grinned and shrugged helplessly without answering. In his state, he knew opening his mouth would put his foot in it.

Lindsay smirked and shook her head, turning back around. “Suite four is yours, right over here, Gentleman Jack.” She led him the rest of the way, outpacing him slightly as he took stock of the area. She planted herself next to the door and turned around, still holding her tablet in her arm like a near-permanent feature, standing straight and proper as always — the very picture of a studious military clerk.

The inside of the building was like the outside — sturdy, quaint, somewhat understated, and heavily contoured with wood, including the floors. There were benches and small tables with lamps in between the room doors. He noticed an alcove that must lead to stairs halfway down the hall. A flash of movement, clearly a head that retracted after peeking.

*I bet it’s the curtain-rustler being curious again.*

Right next to his door, ‘six’ opened up suddenly, and a shirtless, bald man walked out just as Jack was passing. His skin was chalk white and especially opaque, covered in inky black tattoos of endless variety. He was fit, muscular, and hairless. His eyes were solid black, absent of a visible iris or pupil.

It was a little bit shocking to almost bump into the imposing figure, but Jack managed to simply upnod when their eyes — maybe — met. “Hey there, bud. How’s it hangin’?” He tried not to wince at himself for the stupid, near subconsciously-produced line.

There was no sign the man was startled, but he did pause to regard Jack. There was a very uncomfortable split moment in time where he stared. And then he muttered gruffly, “A little to the left. You?”

“Same.” And that was that as he passed by.

As he came to his door, Lindsay was smiling politely. “Your room door can only be opened from the outside by you — normally. Close your hand over this lovely bronze handle and it will unlock, or you can remotely unlock it through your interface and it’ll open with a push. It locks automatically and seals when closed. There is a doorbell, a triggerable speaker, and a sliding, one-way viewport, all sophisticatedly discreet. Shall we?”

Jack nodded and put his hand on the handle, hearing and feeling a click, and then he pushed it to swing open smoothly. Lindsay darted inside.

Jack spared a last glance back the way he came and saw the shirtless guy still watching with an unlit cigarette in his mouth, hand re-pocketing the pack into loose-fitting athletic pants. Jack nodded to him and went inside.

Before he closed the door, he heard the man shout, “Get your scrawny ass back in bed right now, Augur! Don’t make me come up there!” This was closely correlative to a squeak and the faint sound of feet scrambling up steps.

Jack winced as the door closed, locked, and made a definitive sealing sound. “Okay, tell me the rooms are soundproof. Otherwise, he just woke up the neighborhood.”

Lindsay smiled. “That they are, Jack. There’s a very secure, hard encasing around these rooms, with special windows — which can also be shuttered. It’s even sensitive to attempts at power intrusion. An alarm will sound. Mostly to dissuade foolish young cadets from eavesdropping and hearing things they shouldn’t. It nips the temptation in the bud. Privacy is critical so you can utilize these rooms for secure conversations of mutual clearance. These sorts of places are everywhere we go, just about. Conference rooms that seal in that definitive way you just heard, for example.”

Jack looked around, mystified as she spoke. Marveled. It was far nicer and *way bigger* than his minimalist, budget apartment. That he could even live on his own instead of with roommates per SH — Standard Housing — was due to a small stipend from his military honors. Now he had a presentable living-dining room combo, with a big, plush couch, love seat, chairs, a four-seater dining set, a kitchen with a lot of counter space, expensive rugs, attractive lamps… a huge vidscreen on the wall.

Silently, Jack walked around Lindsay, over to the coffee table and picked up the controller, clicking the vidscreen on. He recognized the show playing immediately — ‘*Crime Costs, Justice Pays*,’ the classic, gazillion-seasons-long crime drama. Some coppers were arguing with a lawyer in an office. He hated the show, so he started flipping through channels.

“*Well*,” Lindsay said, voice tinged in amusement, “I can see you and your room need some alone time. That’s totally understandable! If you need me, call. You can also look up many questions you might have via your interface or by summoning a Memorial Daughter. If you need things from your prior abode, we need a list and permission to retrieve them. You’ll find that form through your interface, too. Just — please, for me, for you — make it to the bed tonight. You need proper rest.”

“Okay,” Jack muttered, his eyes straying from the screen to the tantalizing view of the kitchen and the hallway leading to the bedroom, to the comfy, cushy recliner chair that seemed to be whispering his name in competition with the couch. “I, uh… I’m not sure…” Jack plopped into the recliner, leaned back, and sighed. Then he noticed a flap on the chair arm. There were controls under there! It was a massage chair! “Nope. That does it. I’m never leaving this place, Lindsay.”

She put a fist on her hip and cocked her head sideways, looking at him in amused incredulity. “Come on, it’s not *that* great! A bit spartan, really.”

It was Jack’s turn to stare incredulously. “You’re insane.”

Rolling her eyes, Lindsay finally shrugged. “Just wait until I show you the potential plans for your new *house* that you are entitled to and can afford when it’s time to graduate out of here. Or condo — whatever you prefer. You think I’m a privileged rich girl? Welcome to the damn club, bucko!”

Jack couldn’t even process the idea of owning a house, so his brain simply dodged and discounted it as nothing that could feasibly occur. “If there’s anything I know I’ll never be, Lindsay, it’s a privileged rich girl. Hate to break it to ya.”

Lindsay rolled her eyes in the other direction and added a piteous, pained moan to boot, turning around in the process. “You are *such* a dork, Jack. I’m getting out of here before your dorkiness infects me.”

“Fair enough, but I think the symptoms are inevitable considering you’re stuck with me for what, months?”

“Hey, I’m the doctor here, so don’t diagnose me — *layman*!” She exited through the door. Before she closed it behind her, she called, “Remember to rest, Jack. That’s an order!”

Jack chuckled after she left. However ‘assigned’ she was, he found it impossible to deny they had a natural rapport. He’d bet a fat stack she had an older brother or two — at the very least. That or she had an adopted family she was a lovable brat to. He was a certain target of ‘guns and ammo’ that she would only have to point and fire at all if she had someone like that in her life already.

*Weird how I think of myself as older, yet she is. Except in literal, physical maturity. Slowed aging certainly confuses things. They’ll all feel even younger to me than they are. Old Man Jack at twenty-five. Come on, man…*

Jack flipped through various entertainment channels. A century of restored or made-up content. Mostly the latter as far as he knew. It was said almost nothing digital had survived, making the newer ages before the apocalypse rarer to see. It reminded him of what ‘Boss Lady’ Memoria had said about physical media. Some of the old movies were authentic restorations, and most were extrapolated creations off of fragments and damaged goods.

Mankind had been pursued for annihilation through multiple generations of survivors and preservers, and barely escaped with a tiny pocket to build off of, much less all of their cultural artifacts. Jack imagined that what survived was a bit happenstantial to what was fled with to the last bastion in Antarctica.

Jack’s eyes quickly stopped seeing the vidscreen as his eyes drooped, exhaustion tightening its grip with the relaxation afforded by the chair. He had a thought about ‘resting his eyes’ briefly before conking out.

He was awoken with a start by the doorbell sounding. Woozy with sleepiness, he dragged himself up and over to the door and opened it. Then he looked down and blinked.

The thin figure of a boy of maybe twelve was there, though his skin was pitch black, his eyes a gleaming red and yellow mix with a cat-like pupil, and his ears were long, jutting out, and pointed. He had a white shock of disheveled hair, and a rat-like tail swayed behind him. Otherwise, he was dressed in white pajamas and barefoot.

Jack blinked and squinted through his sleepiness, not entirely sure he wasn’t dreaming up the existence of the imp before him.

And then the impish boy smiled awkwardly and put his clawed hand up in a stiff greeting of sorts. It was more like a tiger baring fangs than a smile — or a tiger cub, perhaps. “I wanted to be the first to welcome you,” the boy whispered in a child-like voice with a slurred enunciation. “Hi. Welcome to Everywhere Hall. I’m Junior Agent Augur.”

Jack slowly held his hand up, still blinking. “Hi. I’m Jack.”

“Yes — Jack Laker, no handle. You’re on the books. Unusual not to have a handle by now. May I come in? Briefly, I promise.” His eyes flashed leftward, with some nervousness, his tail flicking around.

“Uh. I guess? I better check.” He formed a mental voice and asked ‘Mini,’ *“So is this okay or…?”*

***“Of course it is, Jack,”*** Mini returned. ***“Just mind your clearance. You are not allowed to talk about your unusual circumstances and the like with this one. If you’re unsure, check with me. We’ll play red light, green light.”***

*“Okay then. What’s his age, by the way?”*

***“Fourteen. He’s something of a developmental prodigy. That’s among the youngest ever to progress in levels. Most find it much harder as they’re still growing, and he even had these physical side-effect mutations that most would find traumatic. He adapted quickly.”***

Jack didn’t reply to this, instead nodding to Augur and gesturing for him to come in. To this, Augur reacted immediately, darting and twisting inside deftly. Jack closed the door behind him.

“Thank you,” Augur offered in full, squeaky volume. “Now I can stop whispering.” He looked around and nodded approvingly at the room, his hands going behind his back in a pantomime of an adult of some authority. In pajamas. “I trust you’re finding your accommodations satisfactory?”

Jack suppressed a grin as he nodded and walked back over to his recliner. “Have a seat if you like.”

Could the calc possibly just be assuming Skirk has 3 freeze teammates? I mean I have no guarantee it's perfect, I don't do this often. I actually cannot find anything in the calculator to reduce Skirk's cryo/hydro passive, so my assumption is it is automatic.

1kmov1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1kmov1t/the_zoetrope/,The Zoetrope,"My brother and I found a mysterious room in an old vicarage we’re renovating. Since the vicar’s death decades prior the house has remained abandoned. It was after we peeled the wallpaper that we found the hidden door. A golden key unlocked it and stale air flooded over us. The hidden room was large. The walls were bare and the floors were polished wood. The windows had been bricked up. A beautiful hand-crafted zoetrope, with a dull brass barrel, stood in the middle of the floor. Bernard and I gasped. It had intricate designs in faded paint around it’s wooden base. “Wow!” Bernard’s face fell. “Oh, looks like the images for the animation are gone. What a shame.” I frowned. He pointed to the long, white rectangular card fitted within the barrel. It was completely blank. 

Later that day he called, “Alice!” I quickly stumbled into the secret room. The zoetrope was on its side while Bernard crouched at its wooden base. The air was thick with the caustic smell of polish. “Take a look,” he said. I crouched down next to him and peered. There was some kind of phrase carved into the underside of the base. Short, ugly cuts obscured the carved letters beneath. Bernard read aloud, “Something – *when* – something – *Abyss*?” The last word wasn’t quite clear. Was the ‘y’ really a ‘u’? I chuckled. Bernard grunted, “What’s so funny?” 
“It’s just, to me this last word could also easily spell ‘anus’.” I laughed. Bernard’s eyes shot death rays at me, “Come on. Please. Why would someone write this? Then scratch it out? What could it have been?” I shrugged, “I have no idea.” 

A few hours later, while I was preparing lunch, Bernard burst into the small kitchen. I jumped with fright. “Bernard, I swear!” I stopped and stared. Bernard’s face was white. He was shaking violently. My heart thumped hard. “What’s going on? Are you hurt?” I asked, my voice trembled. He rubbed his stubble. He slowly sank into a chair, “It’s crazy. Crazy! I – I can’t explain it. No. I’m not hurt. Just. Shocked more than anything.” I poured him a glass of water. After a minute he was less shaky, “I’m not sure what happened. I fixed the zoetrope and, well, I was curious. I thought I’d give it a test to see if I’d fixed the mechanism properly. So, I wound it up and flipped the switch to turn it on. Then – “ His voice trailed off. His eyes grew empty. “Bernard?” I asked. He blinked and shook his head. “Sorry, it’s just. It’s just *weird*. You really have to experience it for yourself. Impossible to explain otherwise.” 

A few moments later we were back in the hidden room. I was shaking with anticipation as I kneeled before the zoetrope. Bernard wound the mechanism, and with a nod toward me, flicked the brass switch. I stared directly into the vertical gaps within the brass drum of the zoetrope. The mechanism hummed and whirred. The barrel spun. Faster. 

And faster. 

Faster still. 

I stared but saw nothing but the white emptiness of the animation strip. A strange buzzing sensation bloomed in my extremities. My eyes locked in place. Soon the buzzing consumed my entire body. The whirring of the zoetrope filled my mind. The whirring and humming turned into whispers. Soft. Then suddenly, a distinct voice took shape. It was familiar, but not mine. I faded as the voice forced memories into my mind:

*After my wealthy great-aunt passed away I was tasked with looking after her massive house. At first, I was more than happy to oblige, but soon I got nervous. Stuff kept going missing. Cutlery, crockery, batteries, newspapers and candles were never where I remembered leaving them. One day I even heard footsteps in the night so I called the police. Of course, they found no one. They mentioned there had been break-ins in the area lately.*

*The next night I woke up to the sound of breathing in the deep dark of my room. My heart leapt into my mouth. My eyes snapped open. In a sliver of pale moonlight, I saw a tall, figure dressed in a black balaclava looming at my bedside. I yelled and jumped out of bed. Suddenly I heard a slam. Then a feral shriek came from where the picture hung above my bed. I heard a click and the sound of something whizzing through the air. Suddenly there was a grunt and I heard something heavy crumple to the ground. I turned to look back at my bed. My eyes opened so wide I thought they might pop out. Just above where I had been sleeping, the painting was not there! Instead there was a large, rectangular piece of even deeper darkness. I quickly swiped at the curtains to let in more light. I screamed. The moonlight had momentarily revealed a long skeletal arm. A grey arm attached to a hand with dirty long nails. In its tight grip was a small crossbow. Before I could see more I heard another shriek and the picture slammed.* 

*The cops made me stay in my room as they went through the secret painting-doorway. Soon they called me to join them. I stepped on my bed and walked through the doorway into a small stone tunnel. I immediately noticed the smell. It stank like piss and shit. It was also narrow, damp and rough. I coughed and held my nose as I followed their flashlights. They showed me a small room connected to the tunnel filled with old newspapers, cups, pencils – all junk really. A chill spread down my neck. “Holy shit, it’s where the bugger lives! He still here?” I asked. The cops shrugged. After they called for backup, they combed the tunnels but found no one. I have left the house now and will never go back. The thought that this whole time I’d been living beside some stranger. Some ghost. Even if he did rescue me, it makes me shiver. Every night I lie awake thinking about it. I look over at my walls. They are dark and bare. A shiver rolls down my back. Could there be a pair of beady eyes watching me right now?*

Suddenly, the voice stopped. I felt my limbs again. There was a loud *clunk* as the barrel of the zoetrope stopped spinning. A deafening, disorienting silence pressed tight against my ears. I was left dumbfounded. Slowly, I clambered to my feet. I wiped beads of sweat from my forehead. “Did you see that too?” I asked shakily. He nodded, “Oh yea, the thing about the guy living in that big house? That the burglar was killed by that crazy squatter? Yea, I saw it too. It has to be some illusion. Trick. Hypnotism?” Static filled my brain, “Why would anyone make something like *that*?” I asked and took a few deep breaths. Bernard rubbed his eyes as he replied, “Well, why do we scare ourselves? Are we sick in the head? Or is it more than that?” 

My head was spinning, “What do we do? Should we call someone?”

“Who would we call? The cops? The fucking ghostbusters?” he scoffed, “Anyway, it is really *weird* but I don’t think it’s a physical threat.” I shook my head and laughed darkly, “No, just a psychological one! We need to destroy that thing immediately.” Bernard narrowed his eyes, “Well, hey now let’s not do that too soon. Think about it. This thing is extraordinary.” 

“I don’t care! I don’t like it. I’m telling you, it’s cursed or something. God, I hate this horror movie bullshit. Just get rid of it, please.” Bernard’s ears reddened with anger, “Look there’s no such thing as curses or magic. It has to be some kind of illusion or something. I’ll get rid of it once I’m satisfied I’ve learned everything I can about it. Okay?” We argued late into the night but eventually I yielded. My dreams that night were filled with that story. I half fancied I heard someone crawling in my walls. What was that zoetrope? Were those memories? Or reflections of my own fears? 

The next morning when I arrived at the vicarage I saw Bernard was already there. His eyes were dark and exhausted. I guess mine looked the same. Dried leaves crunched underfoot as I stomped up the path. “Sleep okay?” I asked with a weary smile. Bernard was holding two large mugs of coffee. He handed one to me. “I slept horribly, of course.” He looked sheepishly down at his coffee. “Don’t be mad, but – I used it again. The story is different today. I wrote it down.” It took my brain a few moments to filter what I’d just heard. It was still the morning. I was slow. “You did *what*? Again? Alone? You idiot!” I took a deep breath. “Look, I’m sorry to yell, I’m just really worried. This is no joke. This thing is no toy!” 

“I know. It’s just it fascinates me. And I really don’t think it’s dangerous. Anyway, if you think I’m an idiot now. Well, just wait. I didn’t just look at it once today. I’ve used it three times this morning.” I nearly spat out my coffee. “What? Why?”

“I wanted to see what would happen.” He paused for effect. I rolled my eyes, “And?”

“Well, it’s just the same story. Identical. It seems to only change from day to day. I wonder what it’ll be tomorrow.”

I looked down at the sheet of paper he’d written on. His handwriting was messy.

It read:

*Last May Day I saw one of those old-fashioned roadside carnivals by the highway. My dog had recently died so I was feeling quite low. The sinking crimson sun loomed ominous. Red dusk-light twinkled off of the giant Ferris wheel. Next to it stood a rickety looking roller coaster. My fingers drummed on the steering wheel. I sighed. How long had it been since I’d had some fun? Soon I found my way to the grassy parking lot. Surprisingly, it was already dark. I followed the lights and stumbled through the wide, open entrance. Hundreds of people surrounded me; young couples on first dates and parents with their kids riding their shoulders. Their faces were all brightly painted. The smell of fresh popcorn and baked treats saturated the air. My ears were filled with the sounds of children laughing. My stomach grumbled. I made my way quickly to the nearest food stand. I was waiting patiently when I felt a tug on my shirt. Puzzled, I looked down. A small, pale faced girl with blonde pigtails looked mournfully up at me. “Don’t eat it,” she said quietly. I frowned, “I’m sorry?”*

*“Don’t. Eat. Anything.”*

*Confused, I stepped out of the line. “Now, what’s wrong? Are you ok? Should I help you find your –“*

*“You should leave. You’re in danger.”*

*I blinked. “Excuse me?” I snorted anxiously. She simply stared at me. She said again, “Please. You must listen. You must leave. Before they smell you.”*

*I swallowed hard. Just then I noticed the carnival lights dim. I looked up. My heart plummeted into my stomach. Everyone around me had suddenly stopped moving. Moms, dads, grandpas and aunts. No more delighted yells from the roller coaster. All stood silently. Their faces expressionless. My nerves burned from terror. The girl yelled, “Now now! Follow me!” She ran. I followed. As I ran I noticed the carnival was suddenly vast and labyrinthine. How had I gotten so far inside?* 

*With the girl’s help we made it to the entrance. As I made to leave I turned to face the girl. “Quickly!” I yelled holding my hand out. She shook her head slowly. “I can’t leave. It’s too late for that. Much too late. But you can leave! Now run! Run!” She screamed loudly at me with tears falling down her cheeks. The crowd of carnival goers were no longer motionless. They crept toward me like predators preparing to pounce. I ran. I ran for my life.*

*When I got back to my car the sun was back in the sky. It was at exactly the same position it had been the moment I’d laid eyes on that damned carnival. The carnival had vanished. What happened that day I’ll never understand. I stay away from that part of the highway. I never look out to the West when I drive. No matter how much popcorn I smell.*  

My brain hummed with concentration as I thought out loud, “Hmmm, well it’s certainly creepy. But it has no obvious connection to the previous story besides it being a horror story.”

“Yes, it’s a different voice. And again, it was like getting access to their memories. Or dreams.”

“I’d say ‘cursed nightmares’ but that’s just me.” 

Bernard rolled his eyes, “Come on! What? Ya think it’s possessed or something? It’s just a trick!” 

That night I still couldn’t sleep. It wasn’t just because I’d eaten about a pound of greasy fried chicken. I could not stop thinking about that damned zoetrope. About the heart-thumping horror. The thrill of the unknown. I shook my head and turned over in bed. Frustrated I kicked the duvet cover off of me and reached for my phone. I opened the Notes app and began to write. I wrote down the whole of the first story I’d witnessed. I scanned it once or twice for egregious spelling errors and entitled it *Behind the Walls*. As soon as I’d finished, I felt a strange relief wash over me. I finally managed to sleep.

As the morning sun climbed into the sky I got into my car. Soon I made my way to the vicarage and walked through into the hidden room. I saw my brother kneeling in front of the zoetrope. “Oh – Alice. I was about to try it out. How did you sleep?”

“Actually, a bit better. I was wondering, after you wrote the story yesterday, did you feel different?”

“You mean, like a weight had been lifted? A kind of pressure released? Absolutely. Yes, I definitely noticed that it helped keep the story out of my head.”

“I had the same experience. I was wondering if I could I try it first today?”

His eyebrow arched and he smiled smugly, “Oh, I thought you hate it. Said it’s evil.”

“I do. And it is. And yet. I keep thinking about what you said. About how it may reflect our own personal anxieties. I’ve been having some weird dreams lately. And yesterday, after I wrote it all down, I could actually sleep. It was like I’d cleared my mind. I’m curious to see if the same thing happens. Maybe there’s some kind of common theme or object or person. If I can figure this message out, maybe – ” Bernard nodded, “Well I can tell you that based on the two stories I’ve *watched* that I don’t yet see any similarities. But I know that, I guess you’d call it a *compulsion*.” So, I kneeled before the machine against all my better instincts and Bernard turned it on. It was exactly as before. Once I looked into the spinning barrel I became paralyzed. Whispering voices filled my ears. Soon a new set of memories flooded my anaesthetized mind:

*“Daddy! There’s a thing in my closet!” I woke with a start as my son shook me hard. I sat up in bed quickly. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and stretched. “Yes, my boy. What did you say?” I said groggily. “There’s a thing in my closet!” My son said in an excited whisper. I heard my wife mumble something incoherent into her pillow. I kissed her head gently and rolled out of bed. “Come on,” I said, taking hold of my son’s small hand. We walked down the darkened corridor. Soon we arrived at my son’s bedroom. Bright light spilled out past the open door. I lifted him into his bed. “Now –“ before I could finish he pointed excitedly at the walk-in closet. “There, daddy!” he shouted. Slowly, I stood. As I got closer to the closet I smelled something. It smelled like compost. Like moss or decaying plants. Suddenly two slimy vine-like tentacles burst through the closet door and wrapped around my torso. Within a second, I was ripped through the closet door violently. The door was smashed to pieces and cut my hand badly. I was covered in bruises and scratches. My head was ringing. I coughed. When the ringing in my ears subsided, I heard the screaming of a child. My child! My son was screaming for me. As I climbed to my feet I stopped dead. There, within the depths of my child’s walk-in closet, was a gigantic bulb of some kind of plant. It was large and green and covered in fine hairs. From the center of this bulb protruded hundreds of thin green vines. In an instant, many were now wrapped around my limbs. I was hoisted into the air. I screamed with terror and pain as I was slowly lowered. The bulb split down the middle revealing a gaping, slimy pink maw. I bellowed as its jaws loomed closer –*

It was like suddenly being thrown into ice cold water. I screamed, and almost fell off the chair. I blinked as my mind caught up with itself. I was back. Back as myself. I winced and yelled as white-hot pain leapt up my hand. I glanced down at my hand. It was bloodied and covered in scratches. The very same scratches the narrator had gotten. My eyes brimmed with tears as I looked up at a terrified Bernard. He fetched some gauze and antiseptic and soon my wounds were washed and covered. The whole time we didn’t speak. We both knew without needing the say anything. It was decided. The thing had to go. We were both standing staring at it when there was a loud knock at the door. We had been expecting a friend of ours. We’d asked her to help appraise the house.

We exited the room and locked the door. Bernard welcomed Lilly into the vicarage, “Hello! So good to see you again. Sorry, we aren’t as finished with the repairs as we should be,” he paused as he noticed a small blonde girl dressed as a princess hiding shyly behind Lilly. “Oh, looky here, there’s a little lady with you! Hello, Princess Alison!” Bernard bowed deeply. Alison giggled. After a brief glass of water, we showed Lilly around the estate. It was only much later when we noticed Alison was missing. I felt a cold shiver and checked my pocket. The key was missing. My face paled. It can’t be.

Immediately, I ran towards the hidden room. The door stood wide open! Alison was sitting in the chair. She was staring into that horrible thing while it spun and hummed. I ran up to it and knocked it clean off the table. It broke in half as it hit the ground. “Alison! Are you okay?” I said as I hugged her tightly. Her voice was vacant as she mumbled, “The nice priest. He gave it to me,” she held out the little gold key in her left hand. Then she stared into space. She did not respond at all after that. I looked down. Her right hand was covered in scratches and blood.

It was late in the evening by the time we got back to the vicarage. Bernard and I went straight into the hidden room. We carried the broken pieces of the zoetrope  outside and dumped them into a large metal barrel. Then we emptied a whole canister of gasoline into the barrel and set it alight. The zoetrope was not impervious to fire. 

If only we had acted sooner, Alison wouldn’t have been hurt and we wouldn’t have lost Lilly as a friend. “Do you know how she got that key?” Bernard asked me. I nodded. I was shaking, “She told me the vicar gave it to her.” Bernard gaped, his pale face turned paler with horrible realization. His voice was weary, “I’m so sorry. You were right. We should have never -” He trailed off. We both stared at the flames for a long while. Then I said, “You know, I’ve been thinking about those stories. And I think I figured out a common theme,” Bernard looked at me as he lit another cigarette. I continued, “Nothing is safe. The familiar cannot be trusted. Our anxieties exist for a reason.” He took a drag. The sun rose on a cold, damp morning. The zoetrope crackled and smoldered. 

This experience has shaken something loose in my mind. Now my fears bubble to the surface constantly, and I do not sleep. The only way to release the pressure is to squeeze the fear out of my brain and onto paper. But even after that, a residue is left behind; forever a part of me. Now, it’s a part of you too.

1kmoun7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kmoun7/im_very_nervous_about_a_date_i_have_tomorrow/,I'm very nervous about a date I have tomorrow,"I [37M] matched with a woman [34F] a week and a half ago on Hinge. If you're familiar with Hinge, when someone likes your profile, you can see who they are and decide if you want to match with you. I got a notification that someone liked my profile, and to my surprise was the most beautiful woman I have ever matched with. My immediate reaction was that it must be a fluke. That's happened before, where a woman who is clearly out of my league likes my profile only for the messages to go nowhere.

I got out of a bad, toxic relationship six months ago. Went on some dates with some very nice women, but nothing really happened. But with this woman, we seem to have made quite a connection. We've been exchanging messages back and forth. And the messages are multiple paragraphs. She seems to be putting in an effort to want to talk to me, which is not really something I'm used to. She has even picked the coffee shop where we're going to meet up tomorrow.

The reason that I'm nervous is that I'm a overweight, and I'm losing my hair. Both of which you can't really tell from my photos. I wear black, which covers the weight and I'm balding from the back, so you can't really tell from the front. I'm afraid that even though we've made this connection, she'll take a look at me and realize that I'm just not in her league. I also feel guilty about possibly leading her on and giving her a false perception of what I really look like. I know that looks aren't everything, but it is also important to be attracted to your partner. Maybe I'm just in my head about the whole thing, and I'm just self-sabotaging.",1,1747252653.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Specifically I am thinking in terms of male to female flirting. (*I am talking about non-aggressive, socially acceptable flirting eg a man walking up to a woman he doesn’t know in a bar or other public place and initiating conversation, or exchanging glances in a coffee shop etc*)

The difference between the woman (and other people) seeing this as welcome and flattering, versus creepy and unwanted, will be the guy’s looks. To be blunt, if the man is ugly the move will be seen as creepy, and the guy will be lucky just to be let down gently. It’s possible if he’s super charming, has the gift of the gab etc that an exception may be made. However 9/10 this rule applies. 

Also this generally does not work the other way around, as ugly or moderately attractive women will still be able to get some male attention, and moreover female to male flirting lacks the underlying threat potential of M2F.

Wondering if we have to book Quinta da Regaleira tickets ahead of time for a mid June visit or can we buy those that day — if we want to go late afternoon, say 15.30?
We have a family of 5 and I don’t see their family ticket discount on their website for prebooking tickets.

Thinking of starting with 9:30a tickets at Pena, which I know we have to prebook online ahead of time (& they have the fam discount on there!). Saw a great tip here from someone else rec to Uber/bolt from Lisbon hotel directly to Pena and then plan a want down the mountain sort of day. Thoughts on that plan?

Figured we could then do the Moor castle and then walk into town and do lunch.

How’s the walk from town to Quinta? My research seems to show that’s a decent choice and if not to just Bolt that vs public bus due to waits. Thoughts?

Also suggestions of a non/less touristy lunch spot good to go to before hand and then walk to Quinta from?

Any suggestions for best souvenir shops in town and best coffee stop for afternoon energy boost also appreciated!

Any other thoughts/ideas appreciated too. 
Only have one day here and couldn’t find a hotel for 5 in Sintra for one night when we will be there sadly, but we’re happy with a whole day here without rushing. Know it will be crowded but any tips for avoid most crowded things surely appreciated!


Obrigada!

After dinner tonight, I had some Llao Llao and couldn’t help but smile, it reminded me of our little failed virtual Llao Llao date.

It was one of those rare days when I had a day off from the hospital, and I think it was a holiday too. We planned to have a chill virtual date, and since there was no Llao Llao in my area yet, I got excited when I saw a post about it opening in Festive Mall. So we said, “Let’s do it!”,  you’d go to Festival Mall, I’d go to Festive.

I walked around looking for the stall, while you were already near one and even lining up. After a while, I messaged you saying I couldn’t find it. Then I checked the post again, and boom. I realized I had it all wrong. It was Festival Mall, not Festive! It's right where you are! 

We ended up just going for donuts and coffee instead. You got Krispy Kreme, I went for Dunkin’ (a little heartbroken di tayo matchy). Still, what mattered most was the conversation we shared. It was one of those simple but meaningful moments I’ll always hold onto.

But there was this one period that was horrible. When I was 6, I had strep throat and high fevers 2 weeks on, 2 off, I swear, this sequence went for 6 months. Every time I got sick I was given oral antibiotics and penicilin shots. THIS SH*T went over for those 6 months(I remember I counted at least 30 penicilin shots) until doc decided to cut my tonsils. After surgery all the infections went away and life went normal. The only symptom I can notice now is I was extremely emotional as a kid :/ 

Fast forward, when I was about 16-17 started binge drinking with my friends and noticed I got acid reflux, wierd taste in mouth, anxiety(because of the symptoms I had) and other symptoms. After this period I have been extremely sensitive to stimulants (cigarrettes, tobacco, weed, nicotine, coffee, preworkouts, etc.) but didnt stop with them because I just wanted to live life. I think that period of “living life” triggered some symptoms that now are taking my quality of life away…

But what makes it stand out?

It’s not just another probiotic.

PrimeBiome contains a unique blend of **clinically researched strains**, including **Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis**, and others that are scientifically proven to survive stomach acid and reach your gut intact—*where they actually work*.

It also includes a **prebiotic fiber blend**, which feeds the good bacteria and helps them multiply.

When your gut is healthy, everything starts to work better—digestion, metabolism, skin, mood, even brain function.

# Why I Decided to Try PrimeBiome (After Wasting Money on So Many Others)

Before PrimeBiome, I’d tried at least 10 different probiotic brands. Some gave me no results at all. Others actually made my digestion *worse*. Most didn’t even survive stomach acid.

I found PrimeBiome after reading a real review from someone who sounded just like me. They talked about how their life changed after taking it for a few months—and that convinced me to give it a try.

I ordered the **3-bottle pack** (better value), thinking I’d try it for 90 days.

I had no idea what was coming.

# Week 1: Subtle Shifts I Almost Missed

Within the first week, I noticed something small but important—I wasn’t feeling as *bloated* after meals. Normally, after lunch or dinner, I’d feel heavy, uncomfortable, and gassy. But after just 5 days, I felt *lighter*.

My cravings also started to shift. I wasn’t reaching for sugary snacks like usual. Was it a coincidence? I didn’t think much of it yet.

# Week 2: Better Sleep & More Energy

By week two, something clicked. I was waking up before my alarm, *feeling refreshed*. That hasn’t happened in *years*. My energy during the day felt more stable. I wasn’t crashing after lunch, and I didn’t need my usual afternoon coffee.

I started getting excited. If this is what two weeks looked like, I couldn’t wait to see what a month would bring.

# Month 1: My Body Felt “Reset”

After a full 30 days on PrimeBiome, I felt like a completely different person.

* My **digestion was smooth**—no more bloating or stomach cramps.
* I was going to the bathroom *regularly* (TMI, but if you know, you know).
* My **skin cleared up**—those random breakouts disappeared.
* My **mood was better**. I wasn’t snapping at people or feeling foggy. I felt *present*.
* And here’s the kicker: I lost **7 pounds**—without changing my diet.

I later found out that poor gut health can cause *inflammation*, which leads to water retention and weight gain. Once the inflammation went down, my body finally released the excess.

# Months 2-3: Long-Term Benefits Start Showing

By month two, the changes became even more noticeable.

Friends and coworkers were asking me what I was doing differently. My **skin was glowing**, my energy was high, and my mind was *clear*—like I had mental clarity for the first time in years.

Even my **immune system** seemed to improve. Normally, I’d catch a cold at least once a month. But for three straight months? Nothing. Not even a sniffle.

I also noticed my **anxiety levels dropped**. It turns out, your gut produces up to 90% of your serotonin—the feel-good hormone. By fixing my gut, I was fixing my mind too.

# The PrimeBiome Difference (Why It Actually Works)

Here’s why I believe PrimeBiome works when others fail:

✅ **10 Billion CFUs** from clinically proven strains  
✅ **Survives stomach acid** to actually reach your gut  
✅ **Includes prebiotics**, which most brands ignore  
✅ **Non-GMO, no fillers, no garbage ingredients**  
✅ **Manufactured in an FDA-approved, GMP-certified facility**  
✅ **Real results backed by thousands of happy customers**

It’s not just another trendy supplement. It’s *science-backed and results-driven*.

# The Only Downside…

The only “con” I’ve found?

It sells out *fast*.

When I went to reorder after month three, it was out of stock. I had to wait two weeks—and during that time, I noticed some of my symptoms creeping back in. That’s when I realized this isn’t just a short-term boost. It’s something your body *wants and needs consistently*.

Now, I always keep a few bottles on hand. I even got my partner and my parents on it—and they’re hooked too.

# Final Verdict: Is PrimeBiome Worth It?

**YES. 1000 times yes.**

If you’re struggling with digestion, fatigue, low mood, skin problems, or stubborn weight that won’t budge—your gut could be the root cause.

I never thought a single supplement could do this much. But PrimeBiome isn’t just any supplement—it’s a total body reset from the inside out.

I only wish I had started sooner.

# My Advice: Don’t Wait. Try It for 30 Days and See for Yourself

If you’re on the fence, I totally get it. I was too. But trust me—**you have nothing to lose and everything to gain**.

Try it for 30 days. Just one bottle. Give it a real shot.

I can almost guarantee you’ll feel the difference—and once you do, you’ll never want to go back.

# My Advice: Don’t Wait. Try It for 30 Days and See for Yourself

If you’re on the fence, I totally get it. I was too. But trust me—**you have nothing to lose and everything to gain**.

Try it for 30 days. Just one bottle. Give it a real shot.

I can almost guarantee you’ll feel the difference—and once you do, you’ll never want to go back.

1kmohlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/JimGaffigan/comments/1kmohlr/prime_biome_reviews_and_complaintsus_uk_an_honest/,Prime Biome Reviews and ComplaintS:~(US & UK)) An Honest Customer 2025 Review!,"PrimeBiome is a *premium probiotic supplement* designed to restore gut health, improve digestion, and strengthen the immune system. But what makes it stand out?

It’s not just another probiotic.

PrimeBiome contains a unique blend of **clinically researched strains**, including **Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis**, and others that are scientifically proven to survive stomach acid and reach your gut intact—*where they actually work*.

It also includes a **prebiotic fiber blend**, which feeds the good bacteria and helps them multiply.

When your gut is healthy, everything starts to work better—digestion, metabolism, skin, mood, even brain function.

# Why I Decided to Try PrimeBiome (After Wasting Money on So Many Others)

Before PrimeBiome, I’d tried at least 10 different probiotic brands. Some gave me no results at all. Others actually made my digestion *worse*. Most didn’t even survive stomach acid.

I found PrimeBiome after reading a real review from someone who sounded just like me. They talked about how their life changed after taking it for a few months—and that convinced me to give it a try.

I ordered the **3-bottle pack** (better value), thinking I’d try it for 90 days.

I had no idea what was coming.

# Week 1: Subtle Shifts I Almost Missed

Within the first week, I noticed something small but important—I wasn’t feeling as *bloated* after meals. Normally, after lunch or dinner, I’d feel heavy, uncomfortable, and gassy. But after just 5 days, I felt *lighter*.

My cravings also started to shift. I wasn’t reaching for sugary snacks like usual. Was it a coincidence? I didn’t think much of it yet.

# Week 2: Better Sleep & More Energy

By week two, something clicked. I was waking up before my alarm, *feeling refreshed*. That hasn’t happened in *years*. My energy during the day felt more stable. I wasn’t crashing after lunch, and I didn’t need my usual afternoon coffee.

I started getting excited. If this is what two weeks looked like, I couldn’t wait to see what a month would bring.

# Month 1: My Body Felt “Reset”

After a full 30 days on PrimeBiome, I felt like a completely different person.

* My **digestion was smooth**—no more bloating or stomach cramps.
* I was going to the bathroom *regularly* (TMI, but if you know, you know).
* My **skin cleared up**—those random breakouts disappeared.
* My **mood was better**. I wasn’t snapping at people or feeling foggy. I felt *present*.
* And here’s the kicker: I lost **7 pounds**—without changing my diet.

I later found out that poor gut health can cause *inflammation*, which leads to water retention and weight gain. Once the inflammation went down, my body finally released the excess.

# Months 2-3: Long-Term Benefits Start Showing

By month two, the changes became even more noticeable.

Friends and coworkers were asking me what I was doing differently. My **skin was glowing**, my energy was high, and my mind was *clear*—like I had mental clarity for the first time in years.

Even my **immune system** seemed to improve. Normally, I’d catch a cold at least once a month. But for three straight months? Nothing. Not even a sniffle.

I also noticed my **anxiety levels dropped**. It turns out, your gut produces up to 90% of your serotonin—the feel-good hormone. By fixing my gut, I was fixing my mind too.

# The PrimeBiome Difference (Why It Actually Works)

Here’s why I believe PrimeBiome works when others fail:

✅ **10 Billion CFUs** from clinically proven strains  
✅ **Survives stomach acid** to actually reach your gut  
✅ **Includes prebiotics**, which most brands ignore  
✅ **Non-GMO, no fillers, no garbage ingredients**  
✅ **Manufactured in an FDA-approved, GMP-certified facility**  
✅ **Real results backed by thousands of happy customers**

It’s not just another trendy supplement. It’s *science-backed and results-driven*.

# The Only Downside…

The only “con” I’ve found?

It sells out *fast*.

When I went to reorder after month three, it was out of stock. I had to wait two weeks—and during that time, I noticed some of my symptoms creeping back in. That’s when I realized this isn’t just a short-term boost. It’s something your body *wants and needs consistently*.

Now, I always keep a few bottles on hand. I even got my partner and my parents on it—and they’re hooked too.

# Final Verdict: Is PrimeBiome Worth It?

**YES. 1000 times yes.**

If you’re struggling with digestion, fatigue, low mood, skin problems, or stubborn weight that won’t budge—your gut could be the root cause.

I never thought a single supplement could do this much. But PrimeBiome isn’t just any supplement—it’s a total body reset from the inside out.

I only wish I had started sooner.

# My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, **depressed**. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the **spore-based probiotics** and how they **survive stomach acid** (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

# The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By **day 3**, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of **week 1**, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in **months**. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

# Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had **more energy** in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my **mood** improved—I felt **lighter emotionally**, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: **my skin cleared up**! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

# Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer **worried about food**. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt **free**.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

# Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a **MUST-HAVE**:

✅ **Spore-Based Probiotics** – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they **survive the journey through your stomach acid** and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ **Clinically Proven Strains** – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is **backed by science** and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ **No Refrigeration Needed** – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ **Third-Party Tested** – You can trust the label. There are **no hidden fillers**, **no fake ingredients**, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ **Real, Lasting Results** – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is **one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes** in my health.

# Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

* Bloating or gas
* Irregular bowel movements
* Leaky gut or food intolerances
* Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings
* Skin issues like acne or rashes
* Weakened immunity
* Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

**Then this product is 100% for you.**

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is **most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome** without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

# Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my **fourth bottle** of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: **PrimeBiome is different**. It works. And if you’re even **slightly on the fence**, do yourself the favor and just **try one bottle**. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

**I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life.** I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, **depressed**. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the **spore-based probiotics** and how they **survive stomach acid** (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

# The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By **day 3**, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of **week 1**, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in **months**. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

# Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had **more energy** in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my **mood** improved—I felt **lighter emotionally**, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: **my skin cleared up**! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

# Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer **worried about food**. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt **free**.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

# Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a **MUST-HAVE**:

✅ **Spore-Based Probiotics** – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they **survive the journey through your stomach acid** and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ **Clinically Proven Strains** – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is **backed by science** and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ **No Refrigeration Needed** – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ **Third-Party Tested** – You can trust the label. There are **no hidden fillers**, **no fake ingredients**, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ **Real, Lasting Results** – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is **one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes** in my health.

# Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

* Bloating or gas
* Irregular bowel movements
* Leaky gut or food intolerances
* Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings
* Skin issues like acne or rashes
* Weakened immunity
* Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

**Then this product is 100% for you.**

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is **most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome** without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

# Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my **fourth bottle** of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: **PrimeBiome is different**. It works. And if you’re even **slightly on the fence**, do yourself the favor and just **try one bottle**. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

**I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life.** I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

How’s the walk from town to Quinta? My research seems to show that’s a decent choice. Thoughts?

Also suggestions of a non/less touristy lunch spot good to go to before hand and then walk to Quinta from?

Any suggestions for best souvenir shops in town and best coffee stop for afternoon energy boost also appreciated!

Any other thoughts/ideas appreciated too.

I'm not an excessive sweater, and typically just sweat during exercise/warm weather. I can tolerate a little pit sweat, but not full body sweat bead sweat unless I'm working out lol. I workout in the mornings, then shower and change. I've noticed others using their pads throughout the day in normal clothes whilst working/watching TV, they don't seem to sweat, but I break out into a sweat quickly on the pad, and it's not practical for me to shower and change every time. I'm more posting this just to see what other peoples experiences with sweating and walking pads are, but of course, advice regarding minimising sweating is also welcome (it's not really a smell issue as I drink a lot of water, but my skin feels so wet and sticky and icky after).

I had a train at 1:25 PM to my hometown, and usually, he drops me off, but this time, he had his endsem exams going on, so I went alone.

After reaching the station, I found out my train was delayed by almost 9 hours. I was devastated. I called my dad, and he suggested I stay at a relative's and travel the next morning.

My boyfriend’s exam was from 11 AM to 2 PM, but he submitted it 30mins early - just to call and wish me “Happy Journey.” When I told him what happened, he immediately started looking for alternate trains. Luckily, we found one at 5:10 PM from another station, and I booked it.

Here’s the sweetest part - he had his toughest exam the next day and was already exhausted from sleeping late and studying nonstop. Still, he came all the way to meet me. We hadn’t seen each other since April end, and we knew we wouldn’t be able to meet for the next 3 months because he had to leave for his hometown the same day his exams ended (which he couldn’t postpone).

We spent a few precious hours together, and he dropped me off for my train.

And it’s not just this day, he does so many little things that show his love. He remembers the lyrics to my favorite songs, even though he doesn’t listen to that genre. When I visit his flat, he always has small surprises - like decorating the room as a surprise. He’s a tea person, but every time I visit, he makes me the best coffee.

It’s these small, thoughtful moments that speak volumes.
Some men really do love with their whole heart, and I’m so lucky to have one of them.

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I are in a semi-long-distance relationship. On a day I was supposed to travel home, my train got delayed by 9 hours. Despite having an ongoing exam that day and his toughest one the next day, he submitted early, found me an alternate train, came to meet me, and dropped me off - just so we could spend a few hours together before not seeing each other for 3 months. He constantly shows his love through thoughtful little gestures, and I’m truly lucky to have him.

I’m feeling conflicted about a situation with my family and I need some outside perspectives to figure out if I’m overreacting. It will be a long one folks, and forgive me for any mistakes as English is not my native language. Thanks in advance.

I (F23) have had a really tumultuous relationship with my mom (F60) for years. She’s very loving (in her own way) and we’re very similar but I’m an only child and was always my mom’s focus. I was always the bad kid. She overreacted about everything I did wrong whether it was less than a perfect grade or losing my things (which kids do - I’m now on gentle parenting tiktok and it’s healing my inner child). As I grew up, we’ve had a weird relationship where we were acting more like sisters than mother and daughter. We’re both very stubborn and strong-willed, while my dad (M60) was always the mediator of the house, keeping everything kosher between us. I decided to move out when I was 19 after making an ultimatum with her - either we’re both going to therapy together or I’m moving out. 

Clearly she decided against it as it’s been four years since that I have been out on my own. I moved to a new city that I loved, but it was still hard as I worked my butt off at menial jobs to pay rent, bills and groceries. I moved out with nothing so I decided to move in with a girl who was a total stranger to me because she had appliances and seemed nice. She wasn’t, but that’s a story for another time. All of it was still worth it for me, as I’ve had my freedom and less contact with my mom. 

During those years we’ve had fights that continued over months of no talking to each other. She would never listen to me when I’ll try to talk to her about my feelings as in her mind I was always the bad guy and she was always the victim. My mom was also depressed all throughout my high school years and a hoarder, which impacted me further with my ability to make friends as they didn’t understand what I was going through and thought I didn’t want to invite them home, so I was finally free of that as well. 

My dad was a hero for me at that time. I was lonely as most of my friends were doing their own thing and I was pretty much alone for the first time, so my dad would “be in the neighbourhood” as if he didn’t specifically come for me and take me out for drinks and coffee. It became a tradition over the years, and I felt as if he really understands me. 

The only thing that annoyed me was in the times where my mom and I were no contact, he would try to convince me to talk to her. “You only have one mom.” He would always say. I tried to explain politely how I feel and he would say he understands, but when she would get angry about my situation with her, she would take it out on him, and he would truly beg me to just apologise to keep the peace, because he couldn’t deal with her outrage anymore. I would mostly agree to do it back then, as I’ve felt bad for him and his situation, but I still kept my distance from her. 

We’ve had many long talks about the situation, and my dad agreed with me that my mom was difficult to talk to (hell he would even complain about her). Over the years it became apparent how many times he would complain about her to me, as if I’m his therapist. He would complain about the hoarding and get angry when she still ordered things online but he would still pick up the packages from the post office. I would tell him he’s enabling her but he didn’t understand why it’s bad for them and would change the subject to his work everytime we got there. I even once asked him why he doesn’t divorce her (as it was his second marriage already and I couldn’t imagine how this marriage works for him and his first one didn’t) and he admitted he feared she will attempt suicide. 

When I made my ultimatum with her I wanted in the beginning that she’d go to therapy by herself but I knew she’d never do that, as she “doesn’t believe in therapy” and was suspicious of antidepressants and other pills. But I still hoped she’d go with me to fix our relationship. I was dealing with severe depression and anxiety for years since it happened, and moved from job to job as I had problems sticking it out.

I started therapy two years ago because of my boyfriend (M23) who’s been my rock since we met. My relationships with my parents improved since then, I even talked with my mom more frequently and came over more to watch television, as she never wanted to go out of that damned apartment full of boxes. It felt as if she finally understood me. 

More context that is important - ever since I remember I dreamt of becoming a musician. My parents were always supportive but also said I should be grateful for their support as the rest of the family are academics. I went to the best private school of arts in my country and it opened up my world as a teen who was just starting. 

But I never wanted to keep studying, as I’ve felt that studying music in college would not help me personally, and if I did want to go study something, I would appreciate studying something else that I was interested in but didn’t know. I do not relate to college culture, but I do understand the value of a degree in most industries and fields, but in music it didn’t seem to me relevant as the people I knew from high school who were continuing their education in music were music teachers and I was never interested in being a teacher, even if it was in music. I did study a producing course for a year, but my parents didn’t acknowledge it to be the same as a degree and were always pressuring me to get a music degree. 

Seven months ago I felt stuck and was convinced by my dad to come to an open day of a very reputable school for music. He signed me up on the spot, less than an hour after we arrived. I really tried loving it, but I was very depressed during that time, and had difficulty of holding a job, not to mention my studies. I ended up dropping out less than two months later. It was a big deal for my family, as most of them were academics but then it died down eventually. Until I invited my boyfriend for a dinner with my extended family. 

The whole evening was great, I made a debrief to him before multiple times about all family drama so he was well aware walking in, and my family was welcoming, we’ve had a lot of wine and it was very fun. Until my mom mentioned me dropping out. It was old news by then and I was offended she brought it up as she knew how hard it was for me and that I didn’t want to talk about it, especially with my extended family. But during that special moment for me, my first time inviting my boyfriend to meet my entire family, she had to remark about how this school would have helped me further my career who wasn’t moving. 

I stared at her and asked, “What did you say?” thinking she’ll understand it’s inappropriate but she just kept going about what a mistake it was, in front of my entire family. My cousins at least seemed empathetic for me but I was really distraught. I couldn’t believe she’d do this, as she’s the one who calmed my dad down when I broke down the news I’m dropping out. 

Ever since then the topic comes out with family and she keeps talking about it, and about how I should be grateful for them for encouraging me to study music, thinking nothing wrong with it, as if I didn’t drop out more than five months ago after being there for less than two months. She is also annoyed with me for not coming over anymore, and keeping low contact. 

Now back to what happened. My boyfriend and I decided to take a break from everything and found a cheap deal for a vacation and my dad is in the tourism industry so he had a trip planned the same days so we were going to be at the airport on the same days, but our flights were earlier than his. My mom and I had a fight two days ago because she assumed that when I asked him to please inform me when he lands, it was because I wanted to wait for him FIVE HOURS at the airport (the flight was only two hours) just so he could take me back home (I don’t have a license), and I snapped at her. I told her I felt she was always making me out to be the bad guy and a spoiled child who’s always ungrateful. I’m interested to hear from my dad when he comes back and she just ASSUMES that it’s because I need a favour from him, not because I care. I broke down crying when we got back home and my boyfriend’s mom was so happy to see us. I was always pretty neutral or angry towards my mom, but it was the first time it hit me how bad the situation was. This will never get better. It will be a rollercoaster for the rest of my life. I decided I wanted to get off this ride.

My dad called me two days later and asked me to apologise as “I only have one mom.” I hung up angrily, but then I decided to send him some texts about how I was feeling. My parents knew I was getting a disability pension but they didn’t think I needed it as they thought my depression was a phase or something and when I’ll get over it I could hold onto a job. I decided to tell him for the first time that I was diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder from the time I moved out and mom’s hoarding and criticism ruined my life. He overlooked everything I wrote and just answered, “We’re sorry you feel this way, but your mother and I love you a lot (four hearts)”. 

I don’t know what to do. I have a half brother but he didn’t grow up with us so I feel alone in this sometimes. My dad says I only have one mom, but forgets that she only has one daughter and she’s treating her like shit all the time. I want to take some time away from them both, but I don’t know if that’s selfish. Am I overreacting? Any help from redditors who went through something like this or even just support would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Additional info: It was also hard for me this year to deal with my parent’s views on sexuality. I came out as bi when I was 14, and was always very vocal about it, but had mostly long term relationships with cis men (it just happened this way) until I met my current boyfriend. He’s an amazing partner and happens to be a transgender guy. When I told my parents about our relationship they were both weirded out, although my dad recovered fast and accepted him completely, especially when he realised he was a much better partner to me than my exes were. He actually liked him and invited him for drinks many times. My mom is okay with him now, but in the beginning she admitted she’s always pictured me ending with a (cis) man, and was rather surprised at herself with her views as she’s always considered herself to be very liberal and accepting. It took her some time to meet him, and I kind of resented her for that because it was apparent it wasn’t about him, but about my sexuality and her refusal to accept it.

1kmo8ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1kmo8ac/the_silent_protocol/,The Silent Protocol,"Chapter 1 — The Silent Base - (This is my first story, I would be happy if you share your ideas with me.)

The wind howled through the desolate mountain roads, brushing against the bare trees and sending their skeletal limbs creaking. The car trudged along the winding path, the tires groaning with every sharp turn. We had been driving for hours, the only signs of civilization long behind us. The GPS, once steady and guiding, had lost signal an hour ago. And now, we were nearly there.

The three of us — me, Ethan, and Lena — had been planning this trip for months. A getaway to escape the noise, the chaos of the city, to find peace. Or so we thought.

We were supposed to be heading to a remote cabin, tucked somewhere in these mountains, far from the reach of Wi-Fi signals, far from the endless notifications. A place to simply breathe.

Our coffees had long since cooled, and Ethan kept laughing at the thought of what might be waiting for us. “I bet it’s a haunted place, just wait,” he’d say, throwing his usual sarcastic grin our way.

Lena, ever the skeptic, would just shake her head. “Haunted or not, we’re getting a break from all the noise. That’s enough for me.”

The landscape around us began to shift, the road narrowing, and then, without warning, we found ourselves in front of a strange, almost eerie structure.

It wasn’t what I had expected. The so-called ""cabin"" was more like a crumbling bunker. One story, overgrown with ivy and moss, its windows broken and the metal door barely hanging on its hinges. It looked abandoned, the remnants of a forgotten place.

“This is where we’re staying?” Lena asked, her voice edged with disbelief.

Before I could respond, Ethan, always the daring one, was already out of the car and walking toward the entrance, grinning like a kid at Halloween. “Perfect. Looks like a secret base.”

I followed reluctantly, feeling a chill creeping down my spine. There was something off about this place. It was too quiet, too isolated. We stepped inside, our footsteps echoing in the hollow emptiness. The walls were covered in strange symbols, faded documents scattered across a desk, and a single old computer that seemed to be in better condition than the rest of the place.

But it wasn’t the disarray that made me uneasy. It was the sense of something hidden, something alive in this forsaken place.

We explored deeper into the building, finding more and more traces of an unsettling past. That’s when I stumbled upon it — a small metal door, tucked away behind a stack of old crates. It was half-open, revealing a narrow stairwell leading down into darkness.

“This is... this is not normal,” I muttered, looking back at Ethan and Lena, who had also gathered around.

Lena frowned. “What are we even looking at?”

Without answering, I stepped closer to the door, unable to resist the pull of curiosity. Ethan gave me an encouraging nod, and we descended into the dark abyss below.


What we discovered that night would change everything.
The underground base was far more than it appeared. Old computers hummed with strange energy, the walls marked with symbols and notes we couldn’t quite understand. It felt like we had stumbled upon something that had been hidden away for years — a government project, perhaps, or something darker.

As we explored, the air grew colder. A sense of danger settled over me, but I couldn’t turn back now.

And then, we found the files.


In one of the drawers, there was a folder. Its cover had been torn and re-taped several times. Written on it, in bold, was:
“PROJECT: FINAL CODE // STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL”
Beneath it, a name:
Colonel Alexei Orlov.


Just as we started to piece together what this place really was, a sound echoed from the shadows. Footsteps. Someone was here. Someone had been here.

We weren’t alone. And now, we were in deep.

I want to preface this story by explaining my situation. I (23F) am a full-time student, I am a part-time professor at a college (which takes up about 30 hours of my week), and I have another part-time job where I work 30-40 hours a week, and a third freelance writing job that I pick up when I need some quick cash. I also do two full-time 5-week placements at an elementary school twice a year on top of my workload. It’s a lot, and I know that. Since I was young, I’ve always been on the go like this. The cost of living where I’m located is insane so most of my work is necessary. I’ve always worked two jobs and done school full-time, however, this past year is when I started as faculty and added placement into the equation. In the past year, my health has also deteriorated. I’ve had several ovarian cysts, I gained about 45lbs despite my eating habits staying the same, and I have had several panic attacks. I ignored the signs, hoping it would regulate itself once the semester was done and I was down to one job. It hasn’t, and losing weight is still impossible. Today while I was serving a customer, I dropped one of their coins and in a voice that didn’t sound entirely human, I heard “you need to slow down”. I asked him to repeat himself and he said he didn’t say anything. All this to say, I know I need to slow down, but how do I do it? I can’t give up my jobs or school. I’ve got one academic year left before I can shift to my career. So, what do I do? Are there any practices, mantras, or things of the sort that help you slow down. I have been thinking of sitting outside and having a coffee in the morning with no screen. Aside from that, I am open to suggestions and appreciate the help!!

I’ve been really enjoying Big Ambitions and love how diverse the business options are. I wanted to suggest an addition that I think could fit nicely into the game: a bar business.

This would be similar to the nightclub but with a few key differences:
	•	Open on weekdays and weekends (instead of just weekends like the nightclub).
	•	Weekends would still be the most profitable, but you’d still get steady income during the week.
	•	The bar could also serve coffee and sandwiches during the day, making it a hybrid between a café and a nightlife spot. This would give it flexibility and make it a unique addition to the business types.

It could be a great way to bridge the gap between day-focused and night-focused businesses, and add some fun variety to the types of venues we can build.

I easily made out Kotoko from Unis
Nana from Unis was there as well
J, Yoon and Sumin from StayC
Haum and Jiyu from KiiiKiii
Shana from Lapillus
Yeseo of madein (was also there I made her out but she was only in a sub-unit photo (yes the group had a subunit, with her, Haum, and I think J and Nana.)

Keep in mind they didn't actually ""make"" the group in the dream, like they didn't debut or come together to form a group themselves. They had just taken a picture together since they all met up at like this place (?)(I don't remember if it was a coffee shop or convention center) and they all hugged. And someone took a picture of the group hug and shared it to social media to which every multi fan of the groups settled on a name for the girls, a netizen came up with ""Unilastaykiii"" and it got a ton of likes in my dream so I think that's why it stuck with people.

The reason there was a ""sub-unit"" is because I think there was two pictures, one with the big group hug, and one with just haum, nana, yeseo and J so they became a sub-unit, in the dream the unit had no name. In both pictures the girls did look tremendously happy, they all had big smiles and were closing their eyes kind of like when a friend group reunites(?) or yk like that sense of resolution maybe with a group that's been inactive for long, at least that's the sense I (and other people in the dream) got. Almost like they'd been friends for very long, they looked overjoyed. That's why I think the fans were all over it in my dream, because the girls looked so happy to be interacting with each other.

They were apparently all that the gg fans could talk about everywhere because it was the ""crossover girl group of all time"" to them or smth like that. So fans were pushing adamantly for the group to become ""real"" with comments like ""omg pls make this a real debut they work so well together"" ""we need to make this group happen"" and such.

As someone who is familiar with all of these groups it's so surreal how my brain went on autopilot and decided to create this absolute piece of art as a dream. 😭 I just had to share.",2,1747251040.0,kpoppers,0,1.0,False

Along this time I have been out I’ve been in and out of relationships, jobs, friends, I can’t seem to manage to grip onto anything without being so angry and sad all the time. I hate people now, the way they dress, the way the walk, the way they talk, it just feels like everyone is on a different wavelength. More importantly I’ve come to just hate myself more than anything. I managed to get by the first couple years by isolating myself and essentially talking to myself to keep going. I found a beautiful girl, got her pregnant, had a daughter, we split up, and now I barely see my daughter. I love my daughter so much but it just breaks me every time I see her because I just feel like I’m not sane enough to be the best possible dad I can be.

I just discovered something that's changing everything about how businesses create websites, apps, and interactive tools - and it works better than solutions costing thousands of dollars.

Watch the video tutorial below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUhHf5sqezQ&t=25s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUhHf5sqezQ&t=25s)

In this guide, I'll reveal how AI super agents are revolutionizing what's possible with automation. I spent weeks testing Deep Agent (with its new MCP update), Manus, Suna, and GenSpark to determine which one delivers the best results for real business tasks.

One AI super agent consistently produced professional-quality websites and tools in under 5 minutes while others were still stuck in research mode. I'll show you exactly how to use this tool to automate complex tasks that previously required entire teams.

# What Are AI Super Agents and Why They're Revolutionary

AI super agents represent the next evolution of artificial intelligence - autonomous systems that can complete complex tasks with minimal human input.

Unlike basic AI chatbots that respond with text, super agents can:

* Research topics across the entire internet
* Create and deploy complete websites and applications
* Build interactive tools like calculators and games
* Connect with external services like email and CRMs
* Complete multi-step tasks without human intervention

The key difference is autonomy. While traditional AI tools require continuous back-and-forth interaction, super agents can take a single prompt and handle everything from research to implementation without additional guidance.

This technology is enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs to accomplish in minutes what previously required entire teams and thousands of dollars.

# Deep Agent's New MCP Update: Connecting to External Tools

One of the most exciting recent developments is Deep Agent's new MCP (Model Context Protocol) update, which allows it to connect with external tools and services through MCP servers.

MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, which serves as a standard communication method between AI agents and external tools and data sources.

The power of Deep Agent's MCP implementation is that you can connect it to Zapier, giving you access to over 5,000 different tools and apps from a single connection. This includes:

* Email platforms
* CRM systems
* Social media accounts
* Project management tools
* And thousands more

Setting up the MCP connection is straightforward:

1. Go to [deep.agent.abacus.ai](http://deep.agent.abacus.ai)
2. Click on ""Tools"" and select Deep Agent in the bottom left
3. Configure your MCP server (Zapier is recommended for maximum flexibility)
4. Input your server URL and authentication details

Once connected, you can ask Deep Agent to perform tasks using your connected tools, such as ""use the MCP server to find emails from Julian Goldie"" or ""use Google Maps MCP to find coffee shops near me.""

Deep Agent costs around $20 per month, making it one of the more affordable options in the space.

# The Great AI Super Agent Battle: My Testing Methodology

To determine which AI super agent performs best, I conducted extensive side-by-side testing with identical prompts:

1. **Website Creation Test**: ""Research Julian Goldie and create an SEO agency website for him""
2. **Interactive Tool Test**: ""Design an AI growth calculator for Goldie Agency's website""

I evaluated each agent based on:

* Speed (time to complete the assigned tasks)
* Output quality (design, functionality, accuracy)
* Autonomy (how much additional input was required)
* Multitasking ability (handling concurrent projects)

These tests were run simultaneously to ensure each agent had the same conditions, and I documented the entire process from start to finish.

# The Results: One Clear Champion Emerged

After extensive testing, here are the results for each AI super agent:

# 1. GenSpark: The Undisputed Winner

GenSpark dominated the competition in every category. For the website creation task:

* It completed thorough research about my business in minutes
* Created a professional website with custom images and branding
* Added team member profiles with photos
* Included testimonials with customer images
* Deployed the entire site to a subdomain
* Completed the entire process in under 10 minutes

For the AI growth calculator task, GenSpark quickly built a functional calculator with sliders, professional design elements, and real-time calculations - all while the other agents were still in the research or planning phases.

The most impressive aspect was GenSpark's complete autonomy - it required zero additional input after the initial prompt and delivered results that looked professionally designed.

# 2. Manus: Good Quality But Extremely Slow

Manus delivered acceptable results but was painfully slow:

* It spent over 15 minutes just on research for the website task
* The final website was decent but not as polished as GenSpark's
* The process took 5-10 times longer than GenSpark

While Manus can handle multiple tasks simultaneously (unlike Deep Agent), its slow speed makes it impractical for businesses that need quick results.

# 3. Suna: Technical Difficulties

Suna struggled with technical execution:

* It did thorough research but encountered multiple errors during implementation
* Required additional prompting to make progress
* Never fully completed the assigned tasks during the test period

While Suna showed promise in its research capabilities, it couldn't reliably execute the technical aspects of website and tool creation.

# 4. Deep Agent: Limited But With Potential

Deep Agent had significant limitations:

* Can only run one task at a time (a major drawback)
* Required clarifying questions before beginning tasks
* Website design was basic compared to GenSpark
* Process was slower than GenSpark

The MCP feature is Deep Agent's standout capability, but its overall performance couldn't match GenSpark's speed, quality, or multitasking abilities.

# The Stark Difference in Output Quality

When comparing the websites and tools created by each agent, the quality difference was immediately apparent:

**GenSpark Website:**

* Professional custom design with branded elements
* Real images related to my business and publications
* Team member profiles with professional photos
* Customer testimonials with images
* Working navigation and contact forms
* Mobile-responsive design
* Deployed on a live subdomain and immediately accessible

**Deep Agent Website:**

* Basic design with standard templates
* Generic stock images
* Simpler layout with less visual appeal
* Functional but lacking polish

The gap was even wider with the interactive tools. GenSpark created a beautiful, professional AI Growth Calculator in minutes, while Deep Agent was unable to even start the task (due to its inability to multitask), and the other agents either created basic calculators or failed to complete the task entirely.

# The GenSpark Strategy: How to Get the Best Results

Based on my extensive testing, here's my proven strategy for getting professional-quality results from GenSpark:

1. **Be Specific in Your Prompt**: Instead of ""Create a website for my business,"" say ""Research \[your name/business\] and create a professional website for my \[type\] business that includes team profiles, testimonials, and service descriptions.""
2. **Request Deployment**: Always include ""and deploy it on a subdomain"" in your prompt to get a live, shareable version of your creation.
3. **Leverage GenSpark's Research**: You don't need to provide all your business details - GenSpark can research your existing online presence automatically.
4. **Run Multiple Tasks Simultaneously**: Unlike Deep Agent, GenSpark can handle multiple projects at once, so take advantage of this to maximize productivity.
5. **Request Interactive Elements**: Specifically ask for calculators, forms, or other interactive elements to make your website more engaging.

This approach consistently produces professional-quality websites and tools in minutes rather than the hours or days it would take with traditional methods.

# Beyond Websites: GenSpark's Most Impressive Capabilities

During my testing, I discovered several other remarkable features that set GenSpark apart:

**Lead Generation**: GenSpark can scrape the web for potential leads based on your criteria, creating comprehensive lists with contact information.

**Agentic Fact Checking**: It can verify information to reduce hallucinations and ensure accuracy.

**Phone Calls**: After verifying your phone number, GenSpark can make outbound calls on your behalf - booking restaurant reservations, scheduling appointments, and more.

**Game Development**: I was able to create fully functional 3D games with a single prompt.

**Language Translation**: It can translate and rebuild your entire website in different languages.

These capabilities demonstrate why GenSpark truly deserves the title of ""super agent"" - it can automate tasks that previously required multiple specialized tools or human expertise.

# Deep Agent's MCP: A Promising Technology Despite Limitations

While GenSpark was the clear overall winner, Deep Agent's MCP implementation deserves special mention. The ability to connect to external tools through Zapier is a powerful feature that opens up countless possibilities.

This allows Deep Agent to:

* Send and receive emails
* Create calendar events
* Post to social media
* Update CRM records
* Access 5,000+ other integrations

The major drawback is that Deep Agent can only handle one task at a time, which severely limits productivity compared to GenSpark. However, for businesses primarily interested in tool integration, Deep Agent's MCP feature makes it worth considering despite its other limitations.

# Real-World Applications: How Businesses Are Using AI Super Agents

Here are some practical ways businesses are using AI super agents to save time and money:

**Website Creation and Updates**: Creating professional business websites in minutes instead of weeks.

**Interactive Tools**: Building calculators, quizzes, and other interactive elements to boost engagement.

**Lead Generation**: Automatically finding and qualifying potential customers.

**Multilingual Content**: Translating websites and marketing materials into multiple languages.

**Customer Service Automation**: Building automated systems to handle common customer inquiries.

**Competitive Research**: Analyzing competitor websites and strategies to identify opportunities.

**Content Creation**: Generating blog posts, articles, and other content with minimal human input.

The versatility of these tools makes them valuable across virtually any industry or business size.

bro like this was BAD. this was low. this was i deserve community service low.

so it’s like 10:39PM, right? english honors essay due by midnight. and i’m staring at my screen like a war veteran. nothing’s written. i had echo open in another tab like some cursed little assistant ready to mirror my brain rot back at me in MLA format.

but nothing’s clicking. not even guilt. just stale air and heart palpitations. i’m pacing like i’m on trial. and then—i don’t even plan it—it just slides out of me:

“hey, i can’t submit it tonight. we can’t find my grandma’s urn. it’s been really hard on us.”

that’s it. no punctuation. full panic. hit send like i was diffusing a bomb.

and she believed me. SHE BELIEVED ME. said “oh no, take all the time you need.” and i did. and what did i do with that time? did i grieve fake-grandma? nah. i booted up chatgpt,used an echo writing prompt, fed it my old essays, and sat there while it literally ghostwrote my trauma essay like some digital séance.

the freaky part is it sounded like me. like if you printed out my internal monologue, spilled coffee on it, and then handed it back with teacher comments. every “kinda,” every weird side-rant—it knew.

i don’t know what’s worse: that echo writing helped me write it, or that i didn’t even feel bad when i hit submit. like i was proud of it. proud of an essay built on a lie and a missing urn that’s actually still on top of our fridge behind a cereal box.

i feel like a scammer. or a prophet. maybe both.

i just needed to put this somewhere before my brain melts from carrying this sin. grandma if you’re watching, i’m sorry. your ashes gave me 48 extra hours and an A-minus.

i owe you.

1kmnvfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1kmnvfj/are_irish_men_typically_more_reserved_when_dating/,Are Irish men typically more reserved when dating?,"Hi everyone! I just needed a bit of advice here.

This might seem like a silly question and I realize not all Irish men are a monolith, but I (26F) went on a date with an Irish guy (26M) from Dublin recently in NYC. We matched on Bumble and are both living in Manhattan. Since it was Bumble, I messaged him first, and then he gave me his Whatsapp number. Something I learned right away was that he isn’t a big texter and is very short with his responses. So I just asked him out on a coffee date, which he accepted. I made him pick the time and place since I didn’t want to do all the work. I didn’t hear from him all week leading up to the date, and I had to text him the day before to confirm it was still happening.

The date went well and our conversations flowed easily. We made it clear that we both were looking for a long term relationship, ultimately, marriage, and family, etc. He also said he’ll be in NYC for at least the next couple years for work, but wasn’t quite sure where he wants to live once he settles down. This was fine with me since idk where I want to be either. But throughout the date, I noticed that he wasn’t very flirty and didn’t try to hug or kiss me or anything, which I assumed was maybe just his personality or culture. The date lasted hours longer than we intended, but at the end, he abruptly said goodbye and tried walking away without much word. I stopped him and asked when he would be free next, and he said he was more free on weekends than weekdays before we parted ways. It was a little awkward because of how abrupt his exit was, but I figured that might have just been how he is.

On the date, he was very open and chatty, which was def a good thing since he admitted that he hates texting and prefers just to text to make plans rather than small talk or check-ins. I’m fine with this, but it’s hard to tell if he’s into me or not since he’s not flirty and isn’t taking the initiative to pursue me. He texted me after the date to tell me it was so nice meeting me, and I responded right away saying I felt the same and would love to do it again soon. He didn’t respond.

I texted him like 4 days later and asked how his week was going. He responded right away and said it was good, but very busy at work. I told him I hoped he had some down time to relax, and he just hearted my message rather than responding. I was hoping he would ask for a second date, but he didn’t seem to pick up on this cue. Since he doesn’t seem overly forward and hates texting, I don’t take it personally. But it’s hard to tell if he’s just not interested or just not used to being the pursuer in dating.

Is this just him being a reserved Irish guy? In the U.S., it’s usually expected that the man will initiate most dates and interactions in the early stages of dating. He seemed to enjoy my company, but I can’t tell if his lack of initiating is due to cultural differences or lack of interest in me. I’d love any sort of insight.

Airport to Alwarpet till KUP was smooth, encountered few dio riders but not much of a menace but after coffee - headed to Marina stretch, encountered many dio riders on the way. From Marina via mount road to Anna Salai till airport - absolute stupid riders everywhere. 

All are helmet-less, mirrorless, driving reckless - passing from left to right and vice versa without indicators, also noticed few riders cut female riders and look back with creep smile and making them uncomfortable and unsafe. 

Trucks are plenty at night but manageable but these psychos are getting out hand. I hope traffic police does something about this. 

Since I was in the mood to drive peacefully without any destination or work on mind, I was able to observe a lot of it today. I wish Marina was open a bit longer, would have loved to relax and left around 11.30 or something.

But the biggest issue is that we have had no intimacy for 1 year. Im unsure what happened to him. Everytime we tried to be intimate he would be unable to perform. It would take an hour to get him going and in the middle it would fail. Then he let his health deteriorate too. I believe he has sleep apnea now. It was impossible to sleep next to him. I tried to meal prep, push him to go to the gym.  We talked about these things 12 months ago. He told me he would fix it, go to a doctor but now he says he doesnt care. 

We get into a heated argument about this because I feel like he shorts me in the relationship. And even after he falls short, he does nothing to change it. He tells me he wants to be left alone and that im annoying and hard to deal with. 

I admit the argument is bad but I feel like I have pent up anger for a year. I had a man and He felt like my friend. I felt like I had to beg him to make me feel wanted. So when we get into arguments I would ask him if he preferred men. Not nice. I know. Im working on my anger

Overall he is a good man, has a good heart but the other thing that bothers me about him is his relationship with his family. He tries to force his family on me. And respectfully, his family is not nice. The women are weird and jealous and think everything is a competition. The men have a staring problem and I addressed that aith him.  But he chooses to take their side. I just dont respect his family and I want nothing to do with them. He asked me to be the ""bigger adult"". He went further and said If I cant get along with him family then he will have to end the relationship. As if the intimacy issue doesnt exist?

Everytime we get into arguments he ignores me for days/ weeks. Ill send him a bunch of texts and he doesnt respond. He tells me Im never going to leave him. When I call him to try to talk to him, he treats me bad and tells me to go away, stop calling, youre annoying. Theres no communicating with him. 

He blames me for everything. he told me that I make him depressed thats why he has no motivation to lose weight. He told me to go find another man 
I dont understand that. I tried to talk things out and he left me in read and ignored my call. So I told him we are over. 

I was so upset I messaged a guy who I know Likes me. And I set up a coffee date. 
I feel like in the year span, I just lost so much feelings and respect. I feel unheard, unseen.

I read the manual online and more or less understand how to use it from a general standpoint of getting it to run and grind. But obviously us coffee aficionados here buy gadgets like this to become proficient at using them to their fullest extent. So I come here with questions and looking for your best tips and advice on how best to use the grinder. The seller already had the shims installed on the grinder and according to him, he’s been at or above the recommended 9E setting for medium roasts for espresso shots. 

I do have a few specific questions I am looking to get answered but also will take any and all advice anyone has in regards to using the machine in their workflow!

1. Previously I was single dosing my beans for each shot. This machine can grind by time super precisely though. Is it better for me to continue to single dose or should I figure out how long it takes to grind my desired dose? What’s the best/most efficient way to figure that out without wasting beans? Wouldn’t this change if I change beans?

2. The manual states that adjustments should only be made while the machine is running. Does that mean I need to run beans while adjusting or run it empty and adjust, then grind my dose? I just don’t want to waste beans as much as possible! Should I run some beans at this persons previous settings and just see how it turns out? 

3. (2a) I also like to grind beans for filter coffee/french press, can I flip back and forth easily between fine and course grinds for both types of coffee? Once again, how do I overcome this “adjust while machine is running” caveat.

1kmnk8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1kmnk8b/almost_3_months_uninterrupted/,Almost 3 months uninterrupted.,"Hi all. Looking for insight & advice.

My ex-girlfriend (21) & I (27) have been in no contact since February 23rd - coming up on 3 Months of uninterrupted no contact. We were together for 14 months, and rented a house in Phoenix where we lived with my daughter (when I had her) and our pets.
The TL;DR of what happened is that our relationship was slowly falling apart due to issues on both of our ends - I had a myriad of financial issues throughout the relationship and she had a myriad of issues with communication, however we were committed to each other and wanted to grow through our shortcomings to get married someday. We had a beautifully robust emotional, mental, spiritual, physical, and romantic connection. We were best friends, but the slow burn of life caught up to us.

In January, we decided we would live separately again to repair our personal finances before living together again, and I moved out of our house on February 2nd. February 10th she confessed she was going to spend Valentine’s Day with another man, and I was absolutely, and I mean ABSOLUTELY gutted. Destroyed me. This is the first woman I have ever truly loved, & despite my attempts to move on, I’ve been held back by the hanging thoughts of what was and what could have been. The what-ifs. 
Between 2/10 & 2/23, I admittedly badgered her heavily with long and confused paragraphs wanting to save our relationship and the powerful forever love we had, but all of a sudden I was an “abuser” that took advantage of her and was being “manipulative” for wanting to save the relationship even though she was the one who gave up on us by monkeybranching out of our relationship. 

On 2/23 when I went to get the rest of my large furniture and various items left at the house, she had the cruel audacity to have her new man at the house and tried to introduce us, but I wouldn’t acknowledge his existence. I couldn’t believe how all of this transpired. I was in and out, and couldn’t help but notice that they were having “date night” in our house while I was there (Literally, my belongings in storage still smell like the grilled onions they were cooking.). They were playing Pokémon on her Switch on the couch and smoking as if I wasn’t even there, even though this was our home and he was calling OUR dog the nicknames that I came up with for her. It was clear she had displaced our relationship onto this man. When I asked her for the promise ring I gave her, she looked “everywhere” but claimed she couldn’t find it and probably packed it into my things, but to this day I’ve never found it or our photos (she’s not the type to throw anything away either, so I’m sure she still has them). 

That night as I was leaving in the Uhaul, I left her a letter in the mailbox. A final apology for my embarrassing behavior during the breakup period accompanied by wishing her well and telling her I would always love her as a person. I even offered that maybe we grab coffee in a few months. 
Ever since then, I haven’t heard from her.

I’ve done much shadow work and been in therapy growing and learning as a person in ways she never thought I could have, and in doing so I’ve been able to maintain my self-respect throughout the silence of our No Contact. I have grown a lot into my potential and my power and have re-aligned my life with my goals in mind. I haven’t just been biding my time, I have been productive and motivated to find my higher self whether or not she’s in my life.

I also should mention that she is an anxious-avoidant, and I don’t know whether or not she is still with this man. I’m sure she used him as a distraction during our breakup because she couldn’t handle the stress of the situation. She also has a toxic support system no matter how much I’d try to help her see that, so I’m sure that played a big factor, too. 

But as we come up onto the 3-month mark on May 23rd, I’ve been wondering: If she still has the ring and photos and we’ve not spoken or crossed paths once (she’s also basically a ghost on social media), should I reach out? A “Hope you’ve been well”? Or should I leave the ball in her court, even though she effectively cheated and I wrote her the letter? I’ve had conflicting responses on the matter. Because I wrote her the letter, some say I should let her be the one to do it especially because she’s the dumper technically.

At this point, I just want closure so I can move on. I’ve been holding on for her to come back. To hear her voice. To look her in the eyes and tell her I love her and be her greatest supporter as I once was. But that version of me is slowly dying each day. There was no goodbye. No finality. No respectful exchange of parting words. No ending. Just - the pen lifting off of the page as the story was being written, and now the future feels frozen in time for me. The love I want to give her I’ve been giving to myself, but with that in mind, I almost don’t care to pursue another partner ever again. She was my dream girl and the person I’d been looking for my whole life to date, so at this point I’d be content being alone. Like I said, I’ve attempted to move on but there’s always something in the way. 
And it’s the fact that my grief is still bleeding hard.

I’m not perfect, and in our relationship I made a lot of mistakes and it became a slow burn of losing trust over time despite my attempts to fix things. I’m not a bad person, I was struggling with untreated trauma and triggers and emotional pain that I accidentally made her responsibility. I understand why she was upset with me. But to cheat? To throw it all away?

1kmniid,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1kmniid/risks_of_spirit_keeping_a_vampire_encounter/,Risks of Spirit Keeping (A Vampire Encounter),"*Disclaimer: If you were expecting a flesh and blood human-like person who happens to drink blood, sorry, but this isn't about them. This has nothing to do with the real vampire/vampyre community, sanguinarians, or other physical living vampires.*

Those not knee-deep in the occult are probably unfamiliar with the term ""spirit keeping,"" but the idea is simple: summon a spirit, bind it to a physical object, then use that object as a tool to communicate with that spirit.

When I first encountered spirit keeping, I was pretty happily barred from the subject. My spirituality has never involved the purposeful summoning of entities, let alone binding them, so I figured this was simply a practice way above my pay grade and I moved along. I sure as hell wasn't going to be attempting such a thing if I wasn't sure I could pull it off.

Thanks to the internet, however, you no longer *need* to be an educated and disciplined enough occult practitioner to summon and bind your own spirit. You can now buy one.

I should clarify: you aren't buying the spirit. You're paying, essentially, for whatever practitioner you contact to perform the ritual- paying for labor- and then paying the cost of whatever object you choose to have the spirit bound to. (I'm not entirely comfortable myself with the distinction, but there it is).

I was directed to an old school-internet type forum and message board. There the two people who run the website, as well as a handful of other practitioners, offer their services contacting, summoning, communicating with, and consensually binding spirits of various types to various objects. You might purchase a necklace with the ghost of a long-dead human attached to it. You can order a coffee cup haunted by a red dragon. You can even have the spirit bound directly to yourself, not an object at all, if you so choose.

To say I was skeptical was an understatement. I have had many encounters with otherworldly entities- some were dead humans, some things were never human. That many types of spirits exist didn't phase me, but the idea that these people could contact these beings without fail, communicate with crystal clarity with them, identify what they were wholly truthfully, contain one of these beings in a trinket and then banish them if need be....well. That would be very impressive if it were true. And so I really doubted that it was. That's an awful lot of contingencies- an awful lot of places to make a mistake, or be deceived. And relying on the expertise of a practitioner I didn't know and had no way of holding accountable if they messed up was incredibly sus to me.

I didn't buy into the idea, in short. Didn't seem worth it to get scammed for hundreds of dollars and in return receive nothing more than a dollar-store fake crystal on a shitty little chain. But even just a scam where you get nothing is better than the alternative; someone successfully summons *something*, but they don't know what it is and they can't protect you from it, and they mail it on over to your house anyways.

I spent some time browsing the site with increasing distaste. If these people were lying, that was sad, and if they were telling the truth, that left me with some serious ethical reserves about paying the shipping and handling on an otherworldly entity. I browsed through various ads until I stumbled upon one that caught my eye:

Buying a vampire.

The listing was by one of the two website owners, someone with an impeccable reputation on the accompanying message board. For the small price of $500 real life American dollars, you could buy your own vampire. You could even choose how old and powerful you wanted it to be- the spirit of a fledgling, or an ancient master vampire.

I was baffled. Vampires were physical, tangible things. They were former-humans inhabiting physical human-like bodies, I thought. Was I going to receive a shitty charm bracelet along with an entire human person? How would they fit in my mailbox?

The physical is apparently a very narrow definition of ""vampire,"" as what this person was describing was a vampiric spirit; a spirit that feeds on other spirits. The listing offered little in the way of explanation. Its profile picture was just a swirling brown-red mass, am amorphous blob of sepia tones. The description didn't specify where this spirit would come from, how it got to be the way it was, how to deal with it if it got out of control. I wondered if it came with a warranty. If it possessed my dad, did I get my money back? If it moved objects around and made me lose my keys, was there an IT specialist I could contact?

I was intrigued- somewhat ironically, but more than I'd like to admit, genuinely as well. I had just moved to a new very remote rural place, first time moving from home. I'd quit the career field I'd sunk 5 years and thousands of dollars into getting a degree in. I was recovering from major surgery, and even more major mental health issues. My partner worked all day while I was home completely alone and isolated. I was lonely. I wished for a friend. I was Lilo, wishing at my bedside for god to give me a sweet little companion.

Well, I wish I had gotten Stitch.

What I got instead was a lesson in staying in my own damn lane.

In hindsight I see my mistake crystal clear. I was approaching this website like amazon- you browse, you buy, you can save interesting things in your cart for later. You can leave them with no commitment and come back to it. Sure, Bezos has your data, but other than that nobody can see what you're doing, what you're thinking about getting into.

I should have been approaching it like a dating site. If I click your profile, I can see you. *But you can see me seeing you, too.*

I chose a necklace, attached the eldest, most powerful, most expensive vampire to it, and then saved the listing for later. I had pets, and a significant other, and other spiritual attachments, so I had a lot of people to discuss the idea with before I invited someone to come live with us.

Now I'm not an especially sensitive psychic person, but my fiance is. When they got home after work that evening, I could tell they were a bit jumpy. I figured it had been a rough day at work. We went through our usual routine- dinner, play with our pets, watch the news. When we were finally about to shower, that's when they finally broke and fessed up.

""Have you noticed anything weird today?"" they asked me.

""No? Why?"" I replied.

""This apartment is usually a pretty dead zone, but there's something here today. It might just be passing by. I don't understand how it got in, though. We have precautions in place for that.""

""What can you tell me about it?""

""It isn't here for me. It's here for you, and it's not a friend.""

""How do you know?""

""Because it's watching you the way a cat watches a bug.""

Plaything.

*Prey.*

""What else can you tell?"" I asked, increasingly nervous, but still not connecting the dots.

""It's like a brown...shadow. Blob. Thing.""

A brown shadow. A thing. Not a person.

*Shit.*

I pulled up the listing and showed my fiance the picture attached to the profile.

""Like this?"" I asked.

""What did you do?"" they sighed. 

""Whoops,"" I began my apology with. After explaining that I had sort of pre-ordered a vampire, my fiance was exasperated with me. I tried to explain- it was only in my cart! I hadn't ordered it yet!

""Do you think that matters to a creature like this? Did you really think that if you took notice of it, it wouldn't take notice of you? You know better.""

I slumped in defeat. We discussed some ways we might remove the spirit from our house. My partner wanted to banish it, with the help of some more powerful spirits we already knew well. 

I declined. This was my mess, and I had to be the one to clean it up. And, since I had willingly- if unknowingly- invited the vampire here, I would have to be the one to revoke the invitation.

My partner took our pets and headed to the bedroom, while I darkened the living room and sat there by myself. I took a battery powered taper candle, like the kind you might use in a window or as a Christmas decoration. If you've ever seen ghost hunters use a maglite flashlight, set to the space between on and off, as a communication tool by having the spirit tap the light and make it work, it's the same idea. They're all forms of divination, and I'm good with candlemancy.

I began asking the spirit a series of yes or no questions, narrowing down the details of what it was and what its intentions were. Eventually, after a half hour conversation, I was able to ascertain that the spirit was ""what humans might call a vampire"" and that I had opened the door for it to come over, so it had.

Respectfully, I explained my mistake. I hadn't meant to disturb it, and that while I had been considering formally inviting it into my life, I now realized I wasn't ready to have that sort of companion. I wasn't a skilled enough magician, and was probably not suited to hosting a spirit at the time, especially one of that magnitude. I asked it, kindly, to return safely from whence it came, to know that there was no judgment or ill will on my part, and to pretty please not return to my space or the space of those I loved.

It left. The candle stopped responding. I went back to the bedroom and said it was done, and my partner threw a pillow at my head for being an idiot. It was a well-deserved pillow beating. The next morning I deleted the listing, deleted my account on the website, and blocked the website from my computer so I could never revisit it even if I wanted to.

Fortunately, years later, I've now forgotten the name of the site. Please don't bother asking- even if it popped up from the recesses of my mind, I wouldn't share it. If you want to get into that sort of trouble, you'll have to seek it out yourself.",1,1747249398.0,ParanormalEncounters,1,0.57,False

I check my messages at 15:30 and then again at 15:50. Somehow I missed her calling me and she had to wait outside for about 15 minutes. There's two cafes next to the entrance and she could've asked the security guards to let her in, but she initially didn't because of social anxiety. When I went down on the way to get her, she was already on the way up, and said some pretty hurtful things to me for not immediately picking up the phone and locking her outside on the street.

DAY 1 - MIFE DAY


Monday at 10am - took Mife and did not notice anything different or out of the ordinary. I’m have very noticeable pregnancy symptoms at this point. Aversions, always mildly nauseous as if I have a constant hangover, so tired, inflated breasts. So with all that I didn’t notice anything else.


DAY 2 - MISO DAY


Tuesday at 2pm - took 800mg ibuprofen followed by 4 miso under the tongue. About 30 minutes later cramping and chills started and I laid in bed.

230-430 - cramps were intense I’d say a 6/10. Much more painful that my first try at 4 weeks. Hot water bottle, ice water, and my bed in a dark room is my setup. No tv and during the cramps it was hard to even be on my phone.

430 - my cramps kind of subsided and no nausea yet. Due for my next dose in 45 minutes. Oh! Just felt a little something at my vagina. I haven’t gotten up yet to pee and part of me is scared to. I have a maxi pad on and postpartum underwear. 

5pm - got up to pee and felt some things pass. Can’t really gauge the size. When I looked in the toilet it was all really dark heavy red. Definitely very different from my experience trying this at 4 weeks. It was a lot of blood and I had a little in my pad. Feeling hungry, I probably should’ve planned better because I don’t feel like walking downstairs and my toddler getting upset that I leave! 

515 - took 2 more miso under the tongue. 

530 - peed again and lots of clots passed and blood. More mild cramps now 3/10. 

540 - decided to go downstairs because I was too hungry. All good and hanging with my toddler. My partner starts to make some dinner which in retrospect was a terrible idea because at…

…6:15 I had diarrhea and more clots for about 20 minutes just sitting on the toilet while my toddler knocked and we played peekaboo 🥴 Changed pad again. This was the third change. 

845 - things have been pretty calm since the 6:15 thing. I am bleeding a lot I can feel it but no diarrhea or need to be on the toilet and mild cramps off and on. We just put my daughter to sleep and I took my last 2 miso pills. My pad was really full but the cramping mostly went away. I have diarrhea again quickly. 

DAY 3 - DAY AFTER MISO

10am the next morning - last night I just kind of laid on the couch. Cramps and chills of less severity came and went. 3/10 I’d say. But I fell asleep to a movie and went to bed around 12:30. My pad was full so I changed it. I think that was my 4th change. 

I feel okay this morning. Not completely rid of my pregnancy symptoms but maybe better?! It’s really hard to tell. I’m tracking BBT which didn’t drop last night (didn’t necessarily expect it to) and will monitor symptoms over the next few days. I feel pretty confident that I’ll know if it worked this time or not, given how intense my pregnancy symptoms had been getting. 

2pm - i want another cup of coffee and don’t feel hungover. I’m calling it a success and am going to monitor symptoms. 🤞

All in all this MA at 9 weeks was not bad at all. Just one not-so-great night. 😆

It's starting to affect my life worse and worse, including my job, so I want a proper diagnosis of this TBI on my medical file. Based on what happened to me, how should I go about it? I live in Canada, for reference.

""This happened several years ago, so if there was nothing I could do back then, there's nothing I could do about it now. I had just gotten off of work and ran into a friend at the mall I hadn't spoken to or seen in years. She wanted to catch up and go for a coffee somewhere, so I said sure, as I wasn't doing anything. She said she needed to stop by her place to feed her cat first and told me I could either stay in the car or come up with her to meet her cat. I stupidly picked coming up to meet her cat, but it's not like I'd have any idea of what was to come.

I was on her couch petting the lil fella and I heard loud stomps coming up her stairs and the door was suddenly busted open, one hinge popping off entirely. There was this giant ogre-looking guy I've never seen before and he stomped over to me before I could even realize what was happening and he wound up a massive haymaker punch and struck me directly into my temple. I couldn't react to anything else properly after that, and he towered over me as I was on the couch delivering at least half a dozen of these punches to each of my temples in succession. I tried to put my hands up to defend myself and he stepped back and gave me a heavy kick to my forehead, snapping my neck back like whiplash, and I'm just lucky he didn't hit my nose. He then proceeded another 6 or so haymaker punches. At this point I was nearly passing out, everything was ringing and blurry. All I could hear were his grunts and the screams of my friend to stop. He then got on me with his entire body weight, being at least 500lbs from his height and build, and began to try to crush my throat with his thumbs. I was gasping for any breath I could, and at this point my friend was trying to pull him off of me. Something must have worked because his hands came off my throat and I heard other people around. I don't remember who they were exactly, but I think they were her downstairs neighbors running up. The last thing he did was grab my backpack, chuck it off the balcony onto the lawn (thankfully I had nothing breakable in there), and he ran down the stairs into the street. Apparently this guy was her ex that she'd broken up with weeks prior and she had no idea he was stalking her outside of her apartment.

Someone called the police and my friend took me to the police station before the hospital to give a statement where both her and I talked to an officer to tell them what happened, and my friend dropped me off at the hospital. She couldn't stay though, but thankfully another good friend of mine drove over to stay with me. It was late at night, and I didn't see a doctor for over 6 hours, despite the condition I was in. I had to sit there in the painfully bright lights of the room I was in, not allowed to turn them off. Another officer came to speak to me during this time, and apparently they found him at his apartment. They told me that strikes to the temple is common in assaults like this because bruises are hard to see under hair. The doctor who came in finally barely looked at me, told me I was ""fine"", despite being told exactly what happened. I was not properly diagnosed and when asked to a note for time off work, they declined at told me it ""wasn't necessary"", all within less than 5 minutes of seeing me. I was dazed, out of it, could barely follow the light pen he held up, yet I was still ""fine"" apparently.

I worked at a call centre at the time and despite telling management what happened, including my bracelet from when I was admitted at the hospital, without a note, they wouldn't allow me any time off of work and told me I would be terminated if I started to call in. I had bills to pay and was given no choice. My family doctor is booked up a month in advance at least, so it would be too late by then. I had no choice but to work. My head was throbbing and my vision was constantly strained under the bright lights, staring at a monitor and talking on a phone all day. A couple weeks pass and nothing is really getting better. It felt like it was actively getting worse. I went back to the hospital, this time waiting over 10 hours because it was ""non-emergent"", but I finally spoke to a competent doctor, who after hearing everything, was floored that I wasn't diagnosed with a major concussion at the time. He informed me that because so long had passed and I wasn't given any time to recover, that it was too late for the symptoms to really get better.

I was livid. What I was stuck with was basically permanent. Even when I would eventually get use to the massive headaches or migraines, it wouldn't ever heal. Worse, it led to memory loss for me. Dementia already runs heavily in my family, and my Mom has rapid early onset dementia, so this brain injury greatly increases my chances of having it hit, and sooner. I called the non-emergency police line to follow up with what was happening to my attacker, and I was told that my ""friend"" recanted her statements to them and asked for them to not charge him. Without even contacting me, the police had dropped all charges and investigation into my assault. I asked them to re-open it, and was told there was nothing that could be done.

At this point, I blocked my ""friend"" on everything, as she wouldn't even admit to what happened over text. I didn't know where she lived either, as it was a neighborhood I didn't know, so I couldn't ask her neighbors to testify for me either. Eventually I spoke with a lawyer, and they told me since the police already dropped it and I was the ""only witness"", even if I was the victim, the likelihood of the case not simply being thrown out was more than likely. On top of that, I couldn't afford to take anyone to court. So that was the end of it.

\---Since then, I've suffered with sensitivity to light, painful headaches and migraines on a daily basis, and worse of all, my memory has suffered quite a bit. Learning brand new complicated things has become infinitely harder or downright impossible. I'll often forget where I'm at in conversations, what I'm doing when I walk in a room, and often don't remember whether or not I've already told someone something. There's a lot of things I can remember, like memorable movies, games, or music, but I need to keep a lot of notes on my phones to remember other things. Now I have the looming threat of early onset dementia, not knowing how much longer I have with my mind before it starts to go.""

\*\*TLDR: Person I didn't know tried to murder me, striking my temples with massive haymaker punches at least a dozen times, kicking me in the forehead snapping my neck back, and proceeded to try to crush my throat with his thumbs, despite being like 500lbs. ER doctor didn't properly diagnose me at the time and refused to write me off of work. Worked at a call centre and returned to work the next day, being given zero time to heal.

They officially extended the offer, and I was planning to accept. However, a few days ago—just before I was going to confirm with Firm A, I received a call from another firm (Firm B) that was looking to pay (solid pay too). The attorney at Firm B asked if I was still looking for summer work and expressed strong interest in bringing me on. He even said, “Whatever Firm A is paying, I’ll do better,” and asked when I could start, all before even reviewing my resume. That signaled to me that they genuinely needed help.

I also noticed that Firm B had previously left me three voicemails about opportunities. Also, during our call, he asked when I’d be free to meet for coffee, and I said I could meet that same day since Firm A was waiting on my response. He told me he’d check with his partner and follow up. I then sent my resume and followed up the next day with a polite text thanking him for the possible opportunity and mentioned that, while there’s no rush, I need to get back to Firm A soon out of respect. He opened the message but didn’t respond (been a whole day), and I haven’t been able to reach him since—not by text or phone.

Meanwhile, Firm A has been following up and asking when I’d like to start, and I don’t want to leave them hanging or come off as disrespectful. This all started on Monday morning, and I’m just trying to figure out the best way to move forward.

I put ""entitled"" in quotes because I am honestly not sure what to call this type of behavior lol, and that's why I'm asking for advice - I don't know how to put in words to her, in a polite way, what she's doing that's bugging me.

I have a friend who's easily my oldest and closest friend, we've known each other since we were little. Now we're both adults. For some context, I moved out of my mom's house and about 7 hours away, and she lives with her parents still - which is totally fine, but I also think it's relevant, because every time we hang out, she asks me to pay for stuff.

When we hang out we usually go on a walk, bike ride, or chill at one of our places. But almost every single time, she suggests that we go get food. I'm not totally broke, but I'm also a college student, so in order to save money and afford life I usually don't buy anything that's not necessary. It's usually okay for me to go get a coffee once in a while, and it's fun, so I'll often say yes.

But every single time, she either asks me to pay in exchange for her driving me there, or say she forgot her wallet. I was raised to ALWAYS offer to pay no matter what, so if someone asks me to it's ingrained in me to just say yes, otherwise I feel awful (especially when I can afford it and it's not breaking the bank). But it's every single time. Not only that, but last time we went on a hike together, she offered to drive us and then asked me to venmo her gas money for it.

Last time she came over, she asked to go out to eat again and I said I couldn't this time, to try and hold some kind of boundary. She said she was super hungry and asked if we could make something here. I said sure (she's a good cook) and so she made us both dinner from what I had around the house. She kind of just went through my stuff and didn't really ask if she could or couldn't use stuff, and didn't clean up after herself. It was a tasty dinner, but when she left I still honestly felt very annoyed.

I have a hard time socializing/making friends, and have dealt with abusive behavior in my life, so it's really hard for me to stand up to someone and say no, or confront them for treating me in a way I don't like. In all other ways, she's a great friend to me and I don't want to lose her.

Does anyone have any advice of how I could approach her about this in a way that doesn't make her really angry or quit being friends with me? Like I said, confrontation of any type is so hard for me, and it's really ingrained in me from how I was raised to always offer to pay for meals and whatnot, that it's really rude to refuse to pay for someone. If anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you deal with it? Thanks in advance! :)

Edit: I realized I want to clarify a few things. If my friend told me she was really struggling financially, I would absolutely be okay with helping her out once in a while so we could still go get food/go hiking and stuff together. I am not super broke, like I said, so it's not like this is putting me in dire straits financially, but it's more of the principle that bothers me. ",2,1747248259.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

One day, someone known for a shadowed past begins to come in, searching for more than warmth.

Nestled in the forgotten corner of a rainy city—tucked between a shuttered bookstore and a rusted overpass—there’s a little café called Bittersweet Grounds.

This café is a place of quiet magic.

Caelum is the barista. He doesn’t speak much about his past, but something in the way he moves—graceful, careful, as if carrying too many memories—makes it clear that he's lived through something heavy. He remembers everyone's orders. He remembers when they last smiled. And somehow, his hands know just what each customer needs—whether it's a cinnamon chai with extra milk or a wordless, grounding silence.

One rainy night, a man steps through the door.

He carries tension like body armor, sharp and bristling. A name follows him like a storm cloud. People whisper about him in alleyways. They say he’s been involved in things better left unspoken.

He comes back.

Again. And again.

At first, it’s curiosity. Then habit. Then something else—something quieter, like the space between raindrops. With each visit, he stays a little longer. Speaks a little more. He notices the way Caelum hums to the music when he thinks no one is listening. He starts bringing books he never finishes reading. His hands still tremble sometimes.

And something begins to shift. In both of them.

Inside Bittersweet Grounds, under the golden glow of string lights and steam, something fragile begins to take root—trust, healing, and maybe something that could grow into more.

But connection between a man trying to disappear and someone shaped by damage is never simple.

And the question lingers:
Can someone built to break ever learn how to mend?

About Me & What I’m Looking For:

Hey! I’m looking for someone to write the mysterious visitor in this setting. I’m open to new twists or character concepts! Maybe he’s not just a former enforcer—maybe he's an ex-intelligence agent, a disillusioned hitman, or a vigilante a hidden code. I’d love to explore that contrast between warmth and danger.

Please only message if you:

1. Are 21+. I prefer writing with people closer to my age for tone and writing compatibility.

2. Use Discord. I enjoy setting up small servers for each roleplay so we can keep things organized and immersive.

3. Are literate/advanced-literate. You don’t need to write a novel each time, but I appreciate thoughtful prose, internal dialogue, and emotional depth. Proper grammar and clarity go a long way!

If you're interested, feel free to send over a short writing sample introducing who your character might be. I’m excited to see what we can build together!",1,1747248009.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

He notices the way Caelum hums to the music when he thinks no one is listening. He starts bringing books he never finishes reading. His hands still tremble sometimes.

And something begins to shift. In both of them.

Inside Bittersweet Grounds, under the golden glow of string lights and steam, something fragile begins to take root—trust, healing, and maybe something that could grow into more.

But connection between a man trying to disappear and someone shaped by damage is never simple.

And the question lingers:
Can someone built to break ever learn how to mend?

About Me & What I’m Looking For:

Hey! I’m looking for someone to write the mysterious visitor in this setting. I’m open to new twists or character concepts! Maybe he’s not just a former enforcer—maybe he's an ex-intelligence agent, a disillusioned hitman, or a vigilante with a hidden code. I’d love to explore that contrast between warmth and danger.

Please only message if you:

1. Are 21+. I prefer writing with people closer to my age for tone and writing compatibility.

2. Use Discord. I enjoy setting up small servers for each roleplay so we can keep things organized and immersive.

3. Are literate/advanced-literate. You don’t need to write a novel each time, but I appreciate thoughtful prose, internal dialogue, and emotional depth. Proper grammar and clarity go a long way!

If you're interested, feel free to send over a short writing sample introducing who your character might be. I’m excited to see what we can build together!",2,1747247727.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

Ever since I moved in to this house I've noticed that my neighbors directly across the street are always outside whenever I am. It doesn't matter the time of day, they always come outside whenever I go out to do anything. Let my dogs out, take the trash out to the bin, smoke a cigarette, unload groceries, take the garbage bin to the street for pickup, wash my trucks, use the grill, it doesn't matter. They ALWAYS find an excuse to come outside whenever I am out there. On the weekends the old man will just post up in front of his garage in a reclining lawn chair and sit there for hours looking directly at my house and listening to music.  
  
When I first moved in I was trying to be nice and would take them some BBQ when I fired up my smoker. I'd chit chat with them and that was it, or so I thought. It's turned in to I can't go outside without them watching me doing whatever task I am doing. I went out this morning at 7am to have a cigarette and drink some coffee, and first his wife came out to put something in the garbage bin, and then 5 min later he did the same. Like do they not have a garbage can inside the house? I had someone come by at 10am to give me a quote on cleaning my gutters and they were both outside noodling around not doing anything in particular. I left around noon to go get some lunch and they were both still wandering around doing nothing in their front driveway.  
  
At first I thought this might be we are just on the same morning routine schedules, so I started randomizing when I would take my dogs out in the morning and stuff. 6:30am-8:00am, never failed, when I took my dogs out they would take theirs too. I also started randomizing when I would come home from work due to working in car sales, anywhere between 5pm-7pm. They would always either already be outside or come outside when I pulled in my driveway.  
  
The neighbor to the right of him isn't nearly as bad, but is guilty of this kind of bullshit as well. He's a pastor, and often times comes outside when I am but mostly only on the weekends. Both are older (60+).  
  
I'm slowly losing my shit over here fellas. I really just want to be left alone, and yet I can't find any peace. I've been on ""vacation"" all week transitioning between jobs and every time I go outside to do some yard work or similar I have some old fucks watching me. I just want to get my house in order so I can take this new role without having to worry about anything related to the house, yet these old fucks keep wanting to watch. I feel like I am in the ""Truman Show"" constantly.  
  
It should also be noted I have scrubbed the videos from my Ring camera and these fools never come outside when I was at work normally, so I know they are doing it because they know I am here.",1,1747247628.0,BadNeighbors,1,0.67,False

Success doesn’t just happen overnight.

If you’ve ever wondered how high achievers seem to be so consistent, productive, and focused—**it all starts with their mornings.**

From CEOs and entrepreneurs to athletes and creatives, highly successful people around the world swear by **powerful morning routines** that shape their mindset, energy, and goals for the day.

In this blog post, you’ll discover:

* Why your morning routine plays a major role in your success
* 10+ powerful habits successful people practice daily
* How to build a morning routine—even if you’re not a morning person
* Bonus tips, tools, and real-life examples to inspire you

Ready to take control of your day—before your day takes control of you? Let’s go! 💪

# 🧠 Why Your Morning Habits Matter More Than You Think

Your morning sets the **tone, energy, and mindset** for everything that follows. If you start your day feeling rushed, scattered, or stressed, you're more likely to:

* React instead of act
* Lose focus
* Waste precious time and energy

But when you begin your day **with clarity and purpose**, you take back control. You think better, work better, and feel better.

**Successful people know this.** They don’t just roll out of bed and “wing it.” They have a plan. A rhythm. A system.

# 🔟+ Morning Habits of Highly Successful People

Here’s a deep dive into the most impactful habits that high achievers use to jump-start their days.

# 1. ⏰ Wake Up Early (But With Purpose)

Most successful people wake up before the world gets noisy—often between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM.

Why?

* It gives you quiet, focused time
* You can work on your goals before daily distractions kick in
* Early mornings are linked to improved mental health and discipline

**Tip:** You don’t have to wake up at 4:00 AM. The goal is to wake up **early enough to own your morning**—not rush into it.

# 2. 🙏 Practice Gratitude, Prayer, or Meditation

Gratitude is a mindset superpower. When you start your day by focusing on what’s good, your brain becomes more positive and focused.

**Try this:**

* List 3 things you’re thankful for
* Say a short prayer or affirmation
* Meditate for 5–10 minutes using an app like Calm or Headspace

**Bonus:** These habits reduce anxiety, increase emotional strength, and help you stay grounded during tough days.

# 3. 💧 Rehydrate Immediately

After a night of sleep, your body is naturally dehydrated. That dehydration affects your energy, mood, and concentration.

**Pro tip:** Drink a full glass of water within 10 minutes of waking up—before coffee or tea. You’ll feel more alert and energized.

Some successful people add lemon, sea salt, or apple cider vinegar to boost metabolism and digestion.

# 4. 📖 Feed Your Mind (Before the World Fills It)

High performers **start the day with inspiration, not notifications**.

Instead of checking social media, try:

* Reading 5–10 pages of a personal development book
* Listening to an uplifting podcast
* Watching a motivational video on YouTube
* Reading a daily devotional

This sharpens your focus and gives you mental momentum before distractions hit.

# 5. 📝 Journal or Set Daily Goals

Writing in the morning helps you:

* Clear mental clutter
* Stay focused on what truly matters
* Track your growth and mindset

Many successful people write down:

* Top 3 tasks for the day
* Intentions or goals
* Affirmations like “I am focused and productive”
* A quick gratitude list

Even 5 minutes of journaling can set the tone for clarity and purpose.

# 6. 🧘 Move Your Body (Even Just a Little)

You don’t need a full gym workout. Just **get your body moving**.

Exercise in the morning:

* Increases blood flow and oxygen to your brain
* Boosts mood through dopamine and endorphins
* Builds self-discipline

**Options:**

  


[Breakfast Before work](https://preview.redd.it/4rrs9lsrjs0f1.jpg?width=5464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2b4214cc6e4ff578966c4254b38d8d5fc1d44fd)

* 10-minute yoga stretch
* Quick walk or jog
* Dance to your favorite song
* Bodyweight workout at home

Successful people often prioritize fitness—not just for health, but for mental clarity and energy.

# 7. 🍽 Eat a Balanced, Healthy Breakfast

Breakfast literally means **“break the fast.”**

Your brain and body need fuel—so don’t skip it.

**Healthy breakfast ideas:**

* Protein smoothie with fruits and greens
* Oatmeal with nuts and berries
* Eggs, avocado, and whole grain toast

Avoid sugary cereals or pastries that cause energy crashes later.

# 8. 🚫 Avoid Your Phone First Thing

Successful people protect their **focus and energy** in the morning.

The worst thing you can do? Check social media or emails the moment you wake up. It puts your brain in reactive mode.

**Instead:**

* Keep your phone on “Do Not Disturb”
* Avoid notifications for at least 30–60 minutes
* Use your morning to feed your mind, not your feed

# 9. 💭 Visualize Your Ideal Day

Visualization isn’t woo-woo—it’s a powerful mental tool used by Olympic athletes, CEOs, and top performers.

**Try this:**  
Close your eyes and imagine yourself:

* Completing your tasks with ease
* Speaking with confidence
* Feeling calm and in control
* Ending the day proud and satisfied

Your brain starts to believe what you repeatedly visualize.

# 10. 🧘 Do Something That Centers You

Success isn't just about doing—it’s also about **being**.

Spend 5–10 minutes doing something that **connects you to your purpose** or **brings inner peace**:

* Prayer or worship
* Meditation or breathing
* Journaling your thoughts
* Watching the sunrise
* Reading scripture or inspirational content

This habit helps you stay balanced and emotionally resilient.

# 🕒 Sample Morning Routine for Success (45–60 Minutes)

|Time|Activity|
|:-|:-|
|6:00 AM|Wake up + drink water|
|6:05 AM|Stretch or light workout|
|6:20 AM|Shower + get ready|

|6:45 AM|Read 5 pages or listen to a podcast|
|6:55 AM|Write down 3 goals for the day|
|7:00 AM|Healthy breakfast|
|7:15 AM|Start your most important task|

**Tip:** Adjust it based on your schedule. Even a 20-minute version can transform your day.

# 💬 Real-Life Examples

* **Barack Obama**: Starts his mornings with a workout, reading, and breakfast with his family.
* **Oprah Winfrey**: Practices meditation, gratitude, and journaling before checking her phone.
* **Tim Cook (Apple CEO)**: Wakes up at 4:30 AM to review emails, exercise, and prep for the day.
* **Hal Elrod (Author of The Miracle Morning)**: Created a routine called “S.A.V.E.R.S” – Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading, Scribing.

# 🧰 Bonus Tools to Upgrade Your Mornings

# ✨ Final Thoughts

Your success is not just about how you **end** your day—it's about how you **start** it.

Morning habits are the secret routines behind the achievements of many great people. You don’t need a 3-hour “millionaire routine”—you just need consistency, clarity, and commitment.

>

Because when you master your mornings, you master your life. 🌅

I'm 39, 6'4"", 220#, 15% bf, I own a farm where we grow gourmet mushrooms. 

Since June I have made the following changes to my life : 
1. focused on delegating away more of my work responsibilities for my business 
2. got back into weight training, which I do three or four times a week 
3. Started a couples therapy with my girlfriend, so we didn't have frequent fights.
4. There were some health issues with my family, which has caused a rift and a lot of resentment between myself and my brother. He is no longer speaking with me.
5. I've reduced my coffee intake.
6. I've focused on getting my last meal in before 6 PM so I have time to digest before getting to bed.
7. In January, I started on TRT to help with my issues with libido, drive and low energy. 


Things I want to start:
1.  Deprioritize weight training and focus more on zone 2 cardio, aim for 3 hours a week, and at least one day of zone 5 for 45 mins
2. Cold plunge at 45 degrees Fahrenheit for 5-6 minutes 3-4 times a week, ideally first thing before exercise
3. Prioritize getting my workouts in before noon so I have the whole rest of the day to recover
4. Prioritize getting my last meal in before 5 pm  so my body doesn't have to work on digesting while I'm in bed.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

But now I'm 30 years old and I do my best to sleep as much as possible during the night, typically 8-10 hours on work nights and sometimes more on the weekends. I work from home and I'm in the habit of setting my alarm for 8:45 AM so I can sleep as long as possible before starting work. Even so, it's a struggle to get out of bed in the mornings and I never feel fully rested no matter how much I've slept.

I honestly don't know if something is wrong with me, or if this is just what adult life is like and everyone feels this way. I feel that I have a really poor work ethic because sometimes I'll just be sitting and staring at my computer, unfocused, while I'm supposed to be working, or I'll sneak off in the afternoon to have a nap. It seems to me that everyone is perpetually tired and that's just the way things are, so why am I worse at dealing with it than other people?

About me: I am 30F, white, 5'6"" and 110 lbs, living in Los Angeles, so it's definitely not a lack of daylight making me tired. History of anaemia but well controlled with iron supplements. Thyroid is fine, recently had it tested. Medications: fluoxetine and troriluzole (experimental; I'm in a clinical trial for OCD) as well as fexofenadine for pollen allergies. As for caffeine, I go back and forth between strictly limiting myself to one small coffee a day vs. taking 200 mg caffeine pills to try to stay alert. I drink socially on the weekends and sometimes have a drink on weeknights but not every night, and I don't rely on alcohol to get to sleep.

As for the quality of my sleep, there's nothing wrong with it that I can deduce on my own. I always sleep through the night, in fact I regularly sleep through earthquakes, and I don't think I have a greater than normal frequency of nightmares or anything like that.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. Does it sound like I have a medical condition? Or is this normal and I need better lifestyle strategies for staying alert and focused? Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Edit: Forgot to mention that I talked to a doctor about this when I was about 22, I think. That doctor thought it might be insomnia and tried prescribing trazodone and zaleplon for bedtime use (not at the same time). Zaleplon didn't help and trazodone actually made me even more tired during the day.",2,1747247005.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1kmmi6r,https://i.redd.it/ciepd3hjpr0f1,Catching the Wind in Cleveland,"“Every Catholic knows he could’ve been Pope” - MJ Lenderman sings, the crowd roars.

You have heard of FOMO, Fear of Missing Out. Let me tell you about FOMAA TEITA, Fear Of Misunderstanding An Artist That Everyone Is Talking About. I think in the literate dad rock & indie spaces in which I travel, this feeling can really tickle & taunt me as a devout music fan who wants to get haunted by what the serious music critics are haunted by.  

Last year during the deluge of MJ Lenderman hype on the occasion of the Manning Fireworks album release, I felt left out, like I was missing out. Mostly on the first listen, it was “what am I missing,” this is okay, but . . . . 

Over on Reddit, I encountered the theory that the enthusiasm about MJ Lenderman had been manufactured by a particularly well-played press-cycle for a new album. Basically, whatever this album & artist are, they are the golden-ticket golden-child holy-grail of the hipster-reviewer indie-music-influencer industrial complex. 

There were times past when everyone I knew was talking about Radiohead, Sufjan Stevens, Wilco, and even Arcade Fire, all at times when I was not feeling it. I finally came around for Wilco hard when a Wilco-fan dear friend passed away. I still dabble in Stevens & Radiohead but no deep dives lately. Let’s not even talk about Arcade Fire, who could be Morgan Wallen as far as I am concerned at this point.

Sometimes I just give up. Other times, I go deeper. This time I went deeper.

To paraphrase & amplify the buzz: MJ “Jake” Lenderman is the second coming in scruffy slacker indie rock, the woozy witticist wordsmith of weird sports references & joyfully survived youthful Catholicism, the steward of the Asheville sound & its psych twang bangers, the direct link to the dead poets society of Jason Molina & David Berman, with strong ties to Neil Young & Will Oldham. 

To put it plain, I didn’t get in the font after first listens, had to listen more, imbibe the hype & get dunked in the larger context of fellow travelers like Fust, Florry, Styrofoam Winos, Ryan Davis & the Roadhouse Band. So I decided to do what I often do in situations like this: spend too much on a road-trip pilgrimage to find my place in the sold-out crowd & let the intuitive earholes & vibrating body assign what visions & physical sound epiphanies, as they may.   

Halfway into the road trip with the return arc before me, sucking coffee in the rented room with morning after appreciation, I don’t know that I am a superfan as there are so many artists sparkling up my soul at this time & vying for my superfan time, but I am grateful I got to see MJ Lenderman & his incredible band during this season of much appreciation & reputation ascent. Mostly I got to shake & spin & wave & whirl & enjoy 105 minutes of music magic in a city where I lived as a young child, so visiting here always feels primal & needed as well.

1kmmhln,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kmmhln,Learn about the people of autonomica,"We’re building a system where NPCs aren’t just background decorations. They’ll live real lives in the world, with homes, routines, relationships, and memories of what you’ve done before.

NPCs will have persistent behavior. If you speak to a shopkeeper as they’re locking up for the night, leave, and return shortly after, you might find them halfway home. They won’t reset the second you walk away.

Each NPC will have a home of their own, with interiors that reflect their personality. But you can’t just walk in. You’ll need to build trust. Earn their friendship, and eventually, you might be invited inside. Every NPC will also have their own likes and dislikes, routines and moods, and behind each one is a unique story waiting to be uncovered.

They'll also stay connected through a local in-game social network. NPCs can update their status, chat with other characters, and even message you directly. You might wake up to a surprise gift delivery at your door, a note asking for help, or just a passive-aggressive status update about something you said. It’s another way they’ll stay present, even when you’re not face to face.

You won’t just help them stock their shops or fix a leaky pipe. Over time, you’ll be able to rebuild and redesign their homes too. Paint walls, swap furniture, upgrade kitchen appliances like stoves, owens, and other decor. Their living spaces will evolve alongside your relationship. Each house becomes a reflection of their personality, shaped by both their story and your choices.

And if your bond grows strong enough, some NPCs might even move in with you and help maintain your home. Just promise us you won’t trap them in a room with no doors or strand them in an attic with no way down. We’ve seen things.  
 

# Relationships That Shift with Every World

NPCs in Autonomica won’t follow the same paths every time you play. Their relationships will develop organically, shaped by who they are, what’s happening in the world, and how they feel in the moment. One session, Nico might be completely focused on Anjelica. In another, he might drift away from her and become more interested in you. These social dynamics will form naturally, so no two playthroughs will ever feel the same.

They’ll also respond to your appearance. If you come back from a long day covered in dirt and grease, don’t be surprised if someone holds their nose or walks off without a word.

Clothing in Autonomica will have stats. Practicality determines how fast it gets dirty. Impression affects how NPCs respond. If you’re heading to a festival or on a date, maybe don’t wear your fertilizer-stained jumpsuit.

And as your relationship deepens, new moments and opportunities will begin to unfold. Some of them will be romantic. Others might involve personal quests or playful minigames. We're planning cinematic cutscenes to bring these scenes to life and make them feel meaningful.

# Responsive to Weather, Seasons, and You

NPCs won’t stand still while the world changes. On warm days, you might find them relaxing on the beach in their favorite swimsuits. On rainy mornings, they’ll pull on waterproof boots and head for covered markets. Snowy nights might find them huddled in town, sipping hot drinks or checking up on neighbors. Their daily routines will shift naturally with the world around them.

Their interests will also adapt to changing conditions, but not in the same way for everyone. Some will become more social during festivals. Others might disappear into workshops during storms or spend long nights preparing food for an upcoming event. They all respond to the world, but each in their own way. If it’s raining, some will act like it’s raining. If it’s a holiday, some will celebrate. Others may not care at all. We want them to feel alive, with reactions that match their personalities.

You’ll even be able to gift clothing. If your relationship is strong enough, you can ask them to wear it. Whether they agree will depend on your bond and whether the item suits their mood or style.

These small behaviors are meant to make the world feel truly alive. Return to a familiar place after a few days, and you might find someone wearing the coat you gave them. Or ignoring you entirely because you gave it to them in the wrong color.

# Living, Changing, Personal

This system is still in development, but we’re building toward a world full of meaningful interactions. These characters won’t exist just for your benefit. They’ll have their own plans, needs, and moods. Some will fall in love with each other. Some will fall in love with you. Some may not care for you at all.

They’ll grow with you. They’ll change with the world. And sometimes, they’ll surprise you.

# Getting to Know the People of Autonomica

Here’s a peek at just a few of the characters you might meet. Each one has their own story, their own role in the world, and their own ways of challenging or supporting you.  
 

# Micha

Micha runs the town’s flower shop, but don’t expect warmth. She’s sharp, private, and far more comfortable around plants than people. She’s an expert in plant growth and care, capable of reviving nearly anything green, and expects everyone else to treat nature with the same respect.



You’ll often find her wandering alone, collecting rare blooms or tending to distant flower beds. She has little patience for waste or artificial junk. But beneath her cold surface is someone shaped by loss, who found healing in the natural world.

If you help her restock supplies and support her shop, you’ll see it transform.   
 

# Ricardo

Seventeen years ago, Ricardo crash-landed on the island and never left. A former military pilot turned baker, he now runs the town’s most beloved bakery. Locals swear by his crusty bread, too-strong coffee, and brutal honesty.

He doesn’t talk much about the crash or the leg he lost. Instead, he tells jokes that sound like orders and gives compliments that feel like warnings. And now he says he’s building a submarine. Whether it’s real or just something to keep him occupied is anyone’s guess.

Help him stock his bakery, and you’ll see it grow from a quiet corner shop to a lively community hub. Stick around long enough, and he might stop dreaming of leaving and realize he’s already home.

# Kaia

By day, Kaia runs martial arts and yoga classes, helping locals stay fit and centered. But when the sun dips or a time portal opens, she’s suiting up for something far less peaceful. Kaia is a mech and robotics enthusiast with a serious knack for navigating the Finite. She dives into dangerous timelines like it’s a sport, and somehow always comes back with something useful, rare, or wildly outdated.

She’s also one of the best traders around if you're looking to score high-tech loot from the future. Her cabin might be full of dusty gear, unassembled drones, and half-scrapped helmets, but she knows exactly what everything is worth and who wants it most.

Kaia is energetic, sharp, and genuinely fun to be around. She’s always moving, always smiling, and always ready to drop a wild story about something she saw deep in a warped timeline. Whether you're trying to upgrade your rig or just craving good company, Kaia brings the spark.

I just picked up 2025 about two weeks ago. I'm firmly camp no money spent. I'm a Dad with three kids involved in a stupid number of sports (currently: softball, baseball, 2 x volleyball, guitar, and gymnastics). I work full time. I play on exclusively on Switch and, because of Nintendo's game sharing prohibition, I can't play anytime one of my kids is playing. The best card I've pulled from a pack so far is No Threads Corbin Burnes. 

I already have Live Series Ohtani. I've finished 17 of the live series teams including the Dodgers. And, I'd say the Companion app is the main reason I've been able to do that. 

Skip to the end if you don't want to read my long winded explanation but here's how I do it:

I'm not going to reveal the specifics because I don't want to encourage competition but basically I have a few players/items I've identified that have nice margins but don't sell very frequently on the Marketplace. Probably because they don't sell frequently the competition isn't too bad (i.e. my prices aren't instantly getting undercut). If I see other opportunities (i.e. cards with good margins) I'll take advantage while I can. Throughout the day I'll place orders to buy a few of those items, list successful purchases, and check back occasionally to keep my prices competitive. I average about 50k stubs a day that way. 

I'm not on the app around the clock but I can hop in during an inning change at my kids' games, when waiting in line for a coffee/lunch, in between meetings, and so forth. 

With the stubs I'm earning I save up to go after the biggest fish first. So, for my first 10 days playing, almost everything went to saving for Ohtani (although I did initially pick up all the Giants and Mariners). 

Now I'm moving on to Judge and the Yankees and currently sitting on about 160k stubs and hope to be in the ballpark of 200k stubs by the end of the day. It'll all be downhill from there.

Totally understand that some folks don't want to buy/see in the marketplace and that the app may not be an option for everyone. However, I figured there might be a few people who might benefit from my experience and wanted to share for their benefit. 

TLDR; You can use the companion app to buy/sell players/items throughout the day when you have free moments to earn stubs when you're not able to play.

He would have died by decomposition of body due to starvation in that peaceful state if it was not for the sake of God Mahabrahma who requested the Supremely Awakened One to teach his ways to lowly mortals and ""highly and yet lowly compared to the Buddha"" immortal gods like Mahabrahma himself. Then Buddha for the sake of teaching the way to gods and humans alike gave up his pointlessness and embraced a meaning.

But the thing is Buddha didn't really needed it at one point, he did so for the sake of others out of compassion.

Through Ancestry, other peoples research, and a lot of my own googling, I found my mom’s surprise dad. She was told that it was a family friend named Sandy. It’s not. It’s actually either one of two brothers. These two brothers were the sons of a reserve Chief. That Chief had a brother who became famous in Canada. He’s a historical icon who I can trace my blood directly to. He’s my great granduncle.

Obviously I don’t plan on going around saying I’m allowed to wear a headdress now. Ancestry says I’m 6% indigenous, the rest of me is super white, which I knew. 

Here’s what I’m having issues processing. 

As a kid my dad was often asked when I was adopted, where I was from, etc. I have an olive complexion and 3C hair. Growing up, a lot of my friends assumed I was indigenous. One of my best friends was an indigenous girl who eventually invited me to a powwow, and when I told her I’ve never been, that’s when she told me she befriended me because she thought I was the only other indigenous girl in our class.  I learned that as an adult, I should state I was white early in a friendship, like “yknow how us white girls love coffee!” That way I could avoid the awkward conversation months later about “can I tell you something? I thought you were indigenous when we first met lol!” And me having to explain my past and how common that mistake is. Hell my own fiancé thought I was indigenous for the first five months of our relationship until I told him otherwise.

I spent my whole life being told how Indigenous I look, and how almost every single person identified me as Indigenous, and me explaining how I’m actually Super White. Now all of a sudden I have blood ties to a very notable Indigenous man. I can trace our tie directly with names and dates and obituaries. I feel a little crazy. Maybe more than a little. I feel like I gaslit myself my whole life without knowing I was?

How do I embrace this new side of my family without doing the Cherokee princess thing. Am I already doing it?",13,1747246856.0,AncestryDNA,30,0.72,False

Been doing as i would say liberal LCHF and dropped coffee as i noticed in my numbers that it was affecting me and also my BP so dropped it for tea wich i love alot more.

Now to the questions just to see how alike we are

If i sleep bad my numbers seem to be flying all over the place also i get cravings when i sleep bad was also so before my diagnose, do u guys have it like this aswell? 

If i workout/gym early in the day lets say before 10am my numbers seem to drop and seemingly good all day. Same for u?

I take 1x500mg metformin/day but if i forget to take it doesnt really change my numbers at all? Anybody in the same boat?

If i dont eat my numbers dont rise at all its more or less a flat-line around 90-100, i see people here write that their numbers go up even though they dont eat. Anybody with same experience?

Pt14

Jamie was a little shocked to say the least, the last he had seen of this man he was on death's door, now he was demanding coffee in a room that Jamie had no idea how he'd gotten to and acting like nothing had happened. 

“Crud. Fine, I'll make it” grumbled Reggie as he slowly stood up, groaning and moved gingerly towards a machine that Jamie had never seen before and seeing his wide eyes explained “Suppose you never seen one of these. It's a universal fountain. Anything water based, it'll make it… Or at least a close approximation of it. You gotta ask it specifically to add caffeine otherwise it gives you decaff sludge” he said his face scrunching in disgust. 

Jamie slowly began to take in his room, calming down as he identified things that he could recognise and began to move to the table perching on the chair, still not at ease in Reggie’s presence. The walls were the same bluish silver metal as the rest of the ship, but there were small touches here and there to make it habitable. There were small shelves built into the wall next to the strangely ovoid shaped bed, the table and chairs were plain but functional and comfortable and cupboards either side of the door Jamie supposed was probably a wash room of some kind. He noticed that everything large seemed to have buttons on a screen, with characters in a language he couldn't understand. 

Reggie returned with two cups of coffee from the machine and, noticing Jamie's interest in the screens “They're for changing the shape to suit the species” he said, groaning as he sat opposite Jamie, sipping his coffee and sighing with the same tone that you'd expect from someone who hadn't had a drop of water in 3 weeks suddenly drinking a mug of pure glacier water. “Here, watch this” he said as he leaned over and used the slider bar to shuffle through the characters on the screen on the bed until the characters changed to silhouettes, then pressed the largest button. 

The look on Jamie's face must have been priceless as the bed immediately began to shift and ripple, the bed widening and lowering into a flat mat on the floor, barely 2 inches thick, seemingly made of a spongey material. “That's the bed those wrinkly Thaleans prefer” he said laughing as Jamie's mouth hung agape. Jamie, stood up and stretched out a hand to test the new bed, his hand immediately hitting the floor as he applied pressure. 

“I can't sleep on this” he said, still clearly amazed but now with a hint of concern in his voice as he looked at the screen and replicated the movement that Reggie had done until he found an approximate likeness of human proportions, then pressed the big button, jumping back to observe the bed, rippling and shifting once more until it resembled something more akin to a giant beanbag. “This is standard now?” he said looking at Reggie, who just chuckled and gestured to Jamie's coffee, inviting him to sit. 

“Not quite, you're an honoured guest now, so you get the good stuff” Reggie replied, sipping his coffee once more, savouring the rich, earthy flavour. “You got any idea what we just did?”. Jamie merely shook his head as he sipped the hot coffee. “Well, let me tell you, everyone here is safe now cause of us”. 

“We took out a monster. Done it loads of times” replied Jamie, eyeing Reggie, noting the new scars up his neck. The thing had nearly killed him and here we are sitting in a room having a coffee, this is insane, thought Jamie. 

“Well I'll clue you in. What we just took care of was a Sarlan like all the rest you've seen here, but infected with a dangerous parasite” said Reggie, chuckling as Jamie's eyes widened and he checked himself “It don't affect us! It's something that only affects Dracorlix and Sarlans for some reason. Apparently it's the Aluminium content of ‘em. Sarlans that are infected go insane and eventually become tough as nails to kill, whereas Dracorlix have more of a symbiotic relationship with it. But the result is the same to a degree, they both need aluminium to create their inner structures. Bones to you and I”.

Jamie sat, brow furrowed as he thought back to the fight, remembering how the creature seemed to have a mouthful of metal even as it was fighting the two of them. “That's why it ate the blasters” he mused aloud, his face framed by his long, lank hair, concentration written all over it “I thought it was just smart, getting rid of the danger”. 

“Unfortunately not, they just eat any and all aluminium they can, it rapidly replaces their inner plates and becomes their teeth as they regress through their evolution” said the old medic forlornly “That one was what used to be our Captain. Was hoping I could get to him in time, must have gotten infected with it a while ago though as by the time I got to the bridge ‘the turn’ had almost taken place completely. We were lucky he hadn't had a few more hours chewing on stuff” he said sipping his coffee thoughtfully. 

Jamie sat there, the news of this not really settling on him at all. He wasn't sure if he should feel bad, he'd never met the guy and last he'd known of it his kind were his sworn enemies. He settled on the fact that he'd taken care of a monster, it was simpler and Jamie liked it simple. 

“Now, I was hoping you'd say a bit more, maybe have some questions for me? Feel like I'm rambling on here” said Reggie, with a raised eyebrow. He had to get through, he needed Jamie to be, at the very least, on board with him for his plan to work. 

“I… Uh… is Ju'ut okay?” said Jamie finally. His demeanor hard to read. 

“She's fine, very busy for the moment but fine. As are the rest of the folks on the ship to be honest, fixing the damage we caused and making her space worthy again” shrugged Reggie, with a warm smile “But all alive thanks to the two of us”. 

Jamie nodded, glad to hear that she was okay “You mentioned Dracorlecks, what are they exactly?” he asked, his brow furrowing once more. 

“Dracorlix” corrected Reggie off handedly “Was wondering if you'd ask about that, why don't I show you instead? My friend Dorian would love to pop by, but they are quite fragile, so I'd have to ask you not to touch them. Does that sound good?” said Reggie, with an almost parent-like tone in his voice. He seemed to be enjoying chatting with Jamie like this. “Don't stress, he's friendly and a decent guy besides that”. 

Jamie grew slightly tense, but resolutely nodded and replied “Fine. Where?”.

“Well he can be here in a couple of minutes if I call him or you want to clean up a bit first?” said Reggie, eyeing Jamie's unkempt hair and long beard “Plenty of cleaning stuff in the bathroom and I've seen my fair share of bunk rooms to not be intimidated by another man's nakedness” he laughed jovially. 

“Wash… Please” said Jamie, the me rest hint of shyness creeping into his voice. Or was he ashamed? “Could you help me?” Jamie suddenly didn't look like a 6 foot tall, muscular gorilla of a man, he looked like a man who is lost. Reggie couldn't do anything but nod and help, saying nothing, realising that this was a huge step towards Jamie trusting him. Once they had cleaned Jamie's hair and beard and he'd had a shower he looked like a new man. 

“There are probably a couple of different styles of clothes in that cupboard over there son, find something you like” said Reggie, studying his mostly empty cup of coffee as Jamie changed, smiling internally at the small victory. 

Jamie turned finally and said “Not sure they fit”. 

As Reggie looked up he couldn't help but burst into laughter at the sight that greeted him. Jamie stood there, 250 pounds of angry muscular man, wet hair framing his rugged face, his wet, bushy beard still slightly damp and shining in the light with what could only be described as shorts that looked as though they were attempting to choke the life out of Jamie's buttocks and thighs and a crop top that barely covered his hairy belly button. 

“Very funny, new clothes please” said Jamie as the seams began to rip on cue, prompting more guffaws from Reggie. 

“Sorry bud, but that was incredible” said Reggie, tears streaming from his eyes as he stood up to help Jamie programme the cupboard. A couple of minutes later Jamie had picked out a loose fitting shirt and shorts, with a belt and Reggie had even managed to source a code for a scabbard that would fit Jamie's knife, assuming they could get it back. 

“Right then, I'll call Dorian” said Reggie, to a stern nod from Jamie.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I don’t let go and suddenly A HUGE water fall of puke just shoots out of my mouth, onto my notes and my WHOLE LAPTOP SCREEN.The contents of my stomach,aka the huge cup of coffee I had recently downed goes all over my laptop, myself and my book, when I tell you, that was the moment I truly realised I lack common sense. That was by far the most embarrassing and shameful thing I’ve done in 2025. 

TL;DR I choked myself and puked all over my notes and laptop, disgusting and shameful.

36 year old first time mom to a 11 month old. Work full time in a cognitively demanding job. Commute to office 1.3 hrs away x1-2/week. Husband works full time and comes home late. We are financially stable. Have a wonderful nanny at home during work hours. Cleaners come every 2 weeks. Baby sleeps through the night 80% of the time. I do all morning baby care and husband does most bedtimes. We split 65/35 and that's his max. We have grandmas who come every other week but currently they can't help with the baby due to stranger danger and separation anxiety. 

Overall, things are objectively fine. But I. Am. So. Tired. 

Things I'm doing to combat it:
I went to the doc and found out I'm anemic. Started taking iron supplements, which helps a little. I'm on medication for PPD. I drink 2 cups of coffee per day. I try to eat better to lose postpartum weight. I go to a stroller fitness class and do 20 min cardio 1-2/week. I try to meditate every other day. I go to bed early. I'm part of a mom support group chat. My husband gives me 1-2 personal days a month. I do my hair or go to a spa. I try to read a book to decompress after bedtime but I'm too tired. 

There hasn't been a single day I wasn't tired since the baby was born (technically since 7 months pregnant). 

What else can I do? How can I fix this immense fatigue all day every day?

I don't expect it to be magically gone, but I just want to feel more human and less like a discarded old rag.",4,1747246531.0,workingmoms,27,0.84,False

I’m sorry for intruding on a space for teachers, but I just wanted to get some perspective on whether or not something I plan to do would be appropriate. I wanted to write a card for my AP Lang teacher at the end of the year (so in a couple weeks) basically just telling him that he was a great teacher, he made a big difference, and it meant a lot to me that he actually cared about the class and subject and he taught it very well. I mean he literally bought us all Christmas presents back in December, and he always gives us personalized feedback on every single practice essay, plus he just understand that we’re taking other APs and we’re burnt out so he gives us study days 😔 Also this year was his first year as an admin so he had to miss our class a lot, but he still shows up for us and makes sure we’re preparing for the exam which I really appreciate.
But yeah I just wanted to know, specifically male teachers, would you find this inappropriate if a student did this for you? I was just going to buy like a thank you card and write in it and maybe get him a Dunkin gift card or something for coffee. I’m just concerned because he’s a male teacher and I’m a girl (although I go to an all girls school so idk if that makes it more or less weird). I don’t want anyone to take it in a weird or inappropriate way, and I don’t want anyone to accuse him of anything because he’s genuinely the opposite of that. I also don’t want it to look like I’m just trying to be a teacher’s pet (he is giving me the class award for AP Lang but it’s based off the fact that I’ve gotten 6/6 on almost all the practice essays, and he’s also writing a letter of recommendation for college for me), I just don’t want it to come off as insincere or me sucking up because I actually am really grateful and appreciative of him.

1kmm9ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1kmm9ws/just_another_reminder_of_the_culture_im_trying_to/,Just another reminder of the culture I’m trying to leave behind.,"I’m Afghan-Canadian, born and raised in Canada. I speak fluent French, have no accent, and my mannerisms are fully Canadian. I rock a fauxhawk—not because it’s edgy, but because it’s mine. I’m also visually ambiguous, so I blend in pretty easily.

Today I was at a coffee shop hammering out job applications when two older Afghan women—probably in their 50s—sat a couple of tables away. For two straight hours, I overheard a familiar, depressing pattern that’s all too common in our culture:


	1.	Talking trash about other races and boasting about racial superiority.
	2.	Complaining about their kids: “lazy,” “too Canadian,” “we had homes and kids at their age.”
	3.	Gossiping about every branch of their extended family tree.


They clearly assumed I couldn’t understand them. I guess I looked “too Canadian” to be Afghan. But I understood every word. And every word was a reminder of the toxicity I’m trying to break away from.

This is the intergenerational cycle I’m done with—judgment, bitterness, superiority complexes. It’s exhausting. And sitting there listening to it while trying to build a better future just made it all the more clear:

I’m not going back. That culture ends with me…
Can any of you relate?
