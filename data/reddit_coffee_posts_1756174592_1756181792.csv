[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/PSGAE16Kj3): **July 20, 2025**

I (27F) got married in Oct 2024 to my now-husband (28M), a military reservist. We had a small mountain wedding after surviving a long deployment, and it was everything we hoped for.

Leading up to it, my mom (61F) emotionally blew up on us — crying, saying we didn’t include her, and even told my husband he ruined our relationship. She apologized to me, but never to him like she promised. Still, we let her come. She even brought her sister (not invited) and I didn’t have the energy to say no.

Fast forward to my twin sister’s destination wedding this spring (I was the maid of honor). My mom was drinking, and at the rehearsal dinner, she told my sister (in front of my husband), “Their wedding was okay… but this is beautiful.” He didn’t tell me until later that night because he didn’t want to ruin the day. That comment crushed him.

When we got home, we made the hard decision: she’s no longer welcome to stay in our home. That was in April. It’s now July. She has no idea.

Since then, we’ve only had vague phone calls, and now she’s saying she wants to come visit “to change up her scenery.” She can’t drive anymore, so if she visits, she’d be fully dependent on us to get around and would definitely expect to stay with us.

I’m frozen. I don’t know how to say, “you can come to dinner, but you’re not staying here.”

I feel like I’ve been protecting everyone else’s feelings for years while mine get ignored. I love her, but I’m drained.

Has anyone ever had to say something like this to a parent? How do you set this kind of boundary without feeling like a terrible daughter?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Her comment may have been while drunk, but drunk people will tell the truth. Which is sadly how she feels about you and your wedding and marriage.

Stop avoiding it and finally tell her that he heard her comment and he doesn't want to host her in his home, which is supposed to be his safety place.

She would intrude that space and expect catering from people that she was mean too.

Because you didn't tell her yet, you are not supporting his feelings, because you are to scared to hurt hers!!!!

You are growing old with your husband not her.

> **OOP:** I believe this is so true! My husband and I have gone back and forth talking about this topic and he has been so supportive along the at giving me time to think about what I want to say and even offered to tell her for me or be there on speaker phone when I talk with her. I am so so grateful for his support and he always apologizes for putting me in a hard place but he is trying to protect both him and I peace especially in our safe space.

**Commenter 2:** ""You realise we're upset with you, right? You shit talked my wedding to people at *twins' wedding, and that really sucked. You've not only disrespected me but you've disrespected my husband, and honestly, I don't want to see you for a while, so until I'm ready, the answer is going to be no.""

I'd go no contact, but it doesn't sound like you're gonna go for that. Nta
> 
> **Commenter 3:** This is a great response. But going no contact? IDK.
> 
> Shoot for healing and moving forward with changed behavior.
> 
> But I'm a person whose Mother is in heaven so....cutting out completely is just sad to me without trying.
>> 
>> **Commenter 4:** This mother sounds toxic though, and she appears to display narcissistic tendencies so I’m sure OP has tried to talk to her in the past about things she’s done and it’s directly led to why OP can’t talk to her now.
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** Yep 100% it’s a lot of different problems over years of trying to changes things and many chances being given and nothing changing

**Commenter 5:** Hey OP — you only briefly mention it, and I don’t know if it actually is a problem, but it sounds like maybe your mom needs to think about her relationship with alcohol. That can make this easier and harder to deal with. Sometimes, especially if they are not actually addicts, it makes it easier to blame the poor behavior on drinking. For example, I have an aunt who enjoyed being a heavy drinker through most of her life, but when she reached around 45 to 50, she became quite a nasty person when she was drinking. Just plain mean, and sharing some very unnecessary, pointed opinions that her sober self would have been quite embarrassed about and never allowed to escape her lips.

Eventually, when she was about your mom‘s age, her son told her bluntly mom I love you, but you are a *bitch* when you drink and you need to stop it.” (This wasn’t a term he used often, and certainly never about her specifically prior to this moment, so it landed like a nuclear bomb as intended.) He listed out specific behaviors and words that came from her mouth that she knew had happened, and her cheeks were hot and red, and she was very angry and upset.

And then she eventually realized that she could continue being embarrassed and ashamed and upsetting her family and being the talk of the gossip chain after every event, or she could stop drinking like an asshole. And thankfully, she chose the latter. She still had a drink now and then, but she slowed down considerably both in quantity and type (straight crown royale on ice became wine spritzers) and never drank to the point anymore where she wasn’t able to watch her mouth and filter her strident opinions (because she wasn’t getting anywhere near as trashed due to the drastic reduction in alcohol volume). Maybe your mother also needs a “let’s come to Jesus and discuss your wine” moment.

> **OOP:** I’ve tried for decades trying to get her to stop. Nothing changes. Everyone in my family has

**OOP on why her mother is not able to drive anymore at her age**

> **OOP:** No she medically lost partial vision so doctor said she is not able to anymore

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/fZ2j5BOvrR): **August 19, 2025 (one month later)**

[UPDATE] My mom said my wedding was “just okay” at my twin’s wedding — and she still doesn’t know she’s no longer welcome in our home.

Hi again — I originally posted about the long-standing tension with my mom, her hurtful comments toward my husband, and my struggle with whether to let her visit. Here’s the latest.

Quick recap for context:

\• My husband (28M) and I (27F) started dating in 2021, engaged in Dec 2023, married Oct 2024.

\• My relationship with my mom (61F) has been complicated for years due to her alcoholism, volatility, and lack of accountability.

\• She was minimally supportive during our wedding planning and made choices that hurt me.

\• At my twin sister’s destination wedding this year, my mom made multiple passive-aggressive comments — including telling my sister that her wedding was “so much better” than mine. My husband heard it, I didn’t.

\• After the trip, my husband and I agreed she would no longer be welcome to stay in our home. Since April, we’ve had very limited contact.

**The recent conversation:**

I finally called my mom to talk about it. She immediately denied saying anything hurtful and essentially called my husband a liar. We went back and forth, and she eventually agreed to call and apologize to him directly. She asked for his work schedule, I gave it to her, and she said she’d call.

Then, instead of following through, she texted saying she wanted a three-way call instead — reframing the situation as a “misunderstanding” or “relay of communication.” I told her clearly this wasn’t about miscommunication — it was about words that were said and how they made us feel. What we needed first was ownership and an apology.

Her reply was that she’s “been accused of speaking without thinking” and now wants to talk with her sister (my aunt) before speaking with us again. She said she’ll let us know when she’s ready.

**The unexpected twist:**

The day after my mom said she wanted to talk with my aunt before speaking to us again, my aunt texted me out of the blue:

“Call me when you have a minute to talk. No one knows I am reaching out to you so please don’t mention it.”

I called her, and we had an incredibly validating conversation. She’s been through almost the exact same dynamic with their mom and with my mom — constant comparisons, disapproval of her spouse, judgment about her life choices. She told me my mom has never taken genuine accountability or given a real apology, and likely never will. She encouraged me to stop chasing approval, keep my focus on my marriage, and keep any interactions with my mom surface-level and drama-free.

Later in the call, I told her that my mom had said she wanted to speak with her before reaching out to us again. The very next morning, my aunt texted me:

“Your mom talked to me when we were having coffee this morning. I will call you later today to let you know what we discussed. I didn’t tell her that you and I talked yesterday nor did I start the conversation — she did.”

When she called later, she gave my husband the lowdown on what we’d discussed the day before and shared what my mom had said. At one point, my mom apparently asked my aunt if she should apologize to us — and my aunt told her no, because she believed it wouldn’t be genuine anyway.

**Where Things Stand Now:**

Despite my aunt’s advice, my mom still texted both my husband and me in a group chat asking when my husband had time this week to talk—after putting us off with excuses multiple times. At that point, my husband (28M) was fully done. He doesn’t want to keep going in circles, and I don’t blame him.

For me, it’s sad to accept that my mom may never be the type to take real accountability or give a genuine apology. I know it’s going to take me some time to heal and move forward, but I also know that low contact (at least for now) is best for my mental health and for my marriage.

I’ll be focusing on my life with my husband, keeping boundaries in place, and leaning on my aunt and of course my husband for support when I need it. If anything changes, I’ll update again.

Thanks to everyone who encouraged me through this—it’s been hard, but I finally feel like I’m putting us first.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I’m a little confused at the boundary. Why would you be happy to spend time with someone who says something like that and instead just not want the person inside your home? She has no idea because you haven’t demonstrated any consequences for her behaviour and you’ve probably caused yourself a problem because now when it does come up, she’ll complain about why it took you so long to say something.

You need to be stronger on boundaries and you need to communicate them to her

> **OOP:** Yes I understand that. I grew up in a family dynamic that we never talked about our feelings or problems and just pushed everything to the side. So with that I’m trying to be better and voice my feelings is why it took me so long because it is not easy for me at all

**Commenter 2:** Hugs. One thing I have learned both through therapy and Reddit groups is that chasing my mom for a change just stressed me out.

The minute I learned to say: she was the best mother she could be vs. She is a good mother to me or that I needed, did my thinking change. You need to work in that she loves you, but she doesn't know what you need and quite possibly can't give it to you. She will not change, but you don't need to change either. Your expectations need to change.

**Commenter 3:** Sometimes letting go of the rope is the only solution. Don't chase love from someone who has no love to give. Do what you need to keep your peace not your mother's. Your husband is your family now. No need to have a confrontation. No yelling, no arguing just let everything fade away. Realize the one losing is your mother. You have so much more in common with your aunt then mom. Surround your self with people that love you and don't see you as less. Life is better without the stress.

**Commenter 4:** I understand your aunts reasoning in her head as to why she told your mom not to apologize,  but I worry your aunt telling your mom not to apologize may be taken wrong.  I see your mom using that as validating she did nothing wrong and doesn't owe you an apology.

I (24f) just moved into an apartment on campus for the semester. It’s my second year of college, and I decided moving out would be a good step and a lot easier than trekking 45 minutes to campus seeing that I’m here 5 days a week (18 credit hours.) I requested a one bedroom apartment, but seeing as they were all taken up for the semester, I had to be placed in a two bedroom. The system works like most colleges I think. If you don’t bring a roommate, a random one will be assigned to you. I was fine with moving in with another random girl seeing as I tend to have an easy time getting along with most people. On paper I’m a good roommate. I clean up after myself, I try to maintain and respect boundaries, I’m not noisy, and I’m pretty social and friendly. We got our roommate assignments in mid June. It was just an email saying we were placed together and a copy of our emails and phone numbers so that we could get in touch with each other. I thought maybe reaching out to her cellphone was too forward, so I sent her an email just basically introducing myself, saying that I was excited to move in and meet her, and that if there were any hard boundaries or requests that she wanted to set, I had no problem with that. Two months went by with no response. Move in date was approaching and I still hadn’t heard a word from her at all. At this point I needed to reach out. There were a couple things that needed to be covered regarding space and such and I figured that maybe she didn’t check her school email so at this point a text should be no problem. I sent her another courtesy text, introducing myself again and letting her know I was moving in that Sunday. She read it IMMEDIATELY. I sat in the chat to wait for a response cause I was just basically doomscrolling. A minute went by and I started to think “man slow reader” until another minute went by and I realized I was just getting blown off. At this point I had heard a couple stories of people just dropping out and not moving in so maybe I got lucky and wouldn’t have to share a space this semester. I moved in that Sunday, a week before classes started, and no one was there. I was excited to have the space to myself. I’ve never lived alone so this was a big step. The week’s been great. I decorated my room, but decided to hold off on fully decorating the living room and kitchen until I knew for certain she wasn’t come. I left half the space in every cabinet and in the fridge just in case, and bought basic stuff for myself to survive the week. I decided that come the final technical move in date, I would let myself decorate the space seeing as she wasn’t responding to me and that must mean she’s not coming, right? Wrong. This woman moves in half way through the first day of classes. I come in to drop my coffee cup off during a gap and have a snack and open the apartment door to her bedroom door slamming shut like she was running to hide from me. I thought maybe I imagined it until I heard her and some random guy, who I assume is her boyfriend, arguing in the bedroom. I couldn’t make out much of what they were arguing about but I got uncomfortable did my dishes and left. It was at this point I decided to shoot her these texts, letting her know about maintenance coming so she wouldn’t be caught off guard and that if she needed me to move any of my things I would be willing to. I don’t want this person to feel like a prisoner in their own space. It’s expensive to live here. Trust me I paid the bill. READ. IMMEDIATELY. AGAIN. No response. At this point I was super uncomfortable about the dude being there seeing as she wouldn’t even talk to me and that she was clearly hiding from me. I figured maybe she was shy, but I’d heard a couple of horror stories from friends about people moving in their partners and full families and I’m a little paranoid about this and she won’t talk to me or fill me in on basic shit. I had rehearsal starting today, so I haven’t been back until a couple hours ago. I got home and made myself some late dinner, and noticed nothing new had been put in the fridge or cupboards. I lay down to watch some tv before bed and lo and behold what do I hear??? My air fryer. Cooking my chicken tenders. Guess what. They weren’t for me. This bitch (or her bf idfk) is eating my food and using my air fryer, condiments, and plates. I can hear it. Whichever of them is out there is slamming all the cabinets. My fatal flaw is I’m a people pleaser. If she would’ve asked, I would not have cared whatsoever. But she didn’t ask. She won’t speak to  me. I genuinely don’t know how to go about this. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do?

This is my first time posting so bare with me. I (28yo F) just got engaged to the love of my life, let’s call her T. I’ve been out as queer for close to 6 years now and my coming out was not great. My then partner outed me via a facebook photo (still not sure if this was purposely done, but that’s another story) in 2019. I was working as a server and my family are very devout Christians. I had a feeling how coming out to them would go based on comments and things said by them about other queer people, think Fox News meets Billy Graham. Needless to say they did not take it well and before they could throw me out of the house, I left. They told me I was being disowned and sent me Bible verses and horrible conversion therapy stuff every day in an “effort” to make me change. It did not work the way they wanted to, but in the meantime I was homeless, sleeping on friends floors and couches. After a couple of months my mom asked me to come to coffee and talk and I did (mostly to hear how my grandparents were doing). We came to a sort of agreement of me moving back in and she told me that she talked to her pastor and he was the one who explained to her that it was not her place to judge. I moved back in right before the pandemic and was essentially “trapped” in that house with two parents who very much couldn’t stand my partner. 

Fast forward to Fall of 2020 after ending my relationship with my former partner, I meet my now Fiancée, T. T and I hit it off right away (we worked together and kept the same quarantine bubble). We fall in love over the next two months and she asks me to move in with her, which I take her up on in true lesbian fashion. My parents are aware I’m seeing someone and when I move out they lose it. I don’t care at that point and move in with T. Over the next couple of months, we move to a different state together for a promotion for her job, adopt a dog and build a life together. Here’s the kicker, my parents LOVE T. She’s the person my dad talks to about his favorite beers and the person my mom called when her front door broke and my dad was away. T even wins over my very religious grandmother who to this day calls T her favorite grandchild (gee thanks). T and I have been together for over 5 years now and she and I have built an amazing life together. We own a home back in my hometown, we started a thriving business together, adopted 3 more dogs and 4 cats and even took in a family friend’s teenage boy who we are now raising. We recently went to the beach for vacation and my lovely T pops the question. I cry, she cries, the random couple at the table next to us cry. It was everything I could have wanted in a proposal. After I said yes and she put the ring on my finger I asked if my parents knew she was proposing ( it wouldn’t have mattered either way, I don’t need their permission to get married). To my surprise she said that she asked for their blessing to propose, and they were supposedly very supportive and pleased to hear that she was asking me to marry her. This obviously makes me cry again because while I don’t need their permission to marry the woman I love, I never thought I’d get to a point with them where they would fully accept my queerness and especially marrying a woman. 
Here’s where it gets weird… I tried to call my mom and dad as soon as we get back to the car. I call my mom first, no answer. Try my dad, no answer either. I ask T “did they know what time you were asking me?” T: “ya I told them it would be at dinner at this time”

I let it go and figure that my parents are making dinner or something, still weird considering your daughter just got engaged, you would think they would have been waiting for a call. I call them again when we get back to the house and again, nothing. I even text my mom asking her to call me. An hour later I get a call from her. I pick up the phone super excited and her and my dad are on the call together. Except… they treat it like any other call. No congratulations, no well wishes, no asking to see a picture of the ring or anything. Just “oh okay that’s good” in response to my telling her that T proposed. I ask if everything is okay and they say yes that they were just out walking the dogs. Again… odd but okay. 
Fast forward to us coming home from our vacation the day after. I go up to their house to drop off a birthday gift for my mom and have dinner with them and my grandparents. I’m very clearly wearing my engagement ring and not one of them says a thing about getting engaged. I find it a little odd but move on and enjoy the evening with my family. Fast forward two weeks and my parents still haven’t seen one photo, one video or even liked the damn facebook post (they are both chronically on that damn app). Meanwhile my amazing future mother in law is making posts about us the days after we get engaged and welcoming me to her family and talking about how excited she is for a wedding. This is what really made me realize that maybe my parents aren’t so over things as I thought they were. So last weekend I’m on the phone with my mom and I ask her very bluntly if she is struggling with the idea of me marrying T. She says no and that she’s “made her peace with it years ago”. Not exactly a great response, but I am very honest with her and tell her that I’m a bit hurt by her not asking anything about the wedding or the engagement. I told her that I always pictured me planning my wedding with my mom’s help one day and that I understand that she didn’t probably picture her daughter marrying a woman one day. She then asks, “well where are you going to get married, is it even legal?” Now keep in mind, this is the same woman who cried the day that gay marriage was legalized federally in 2015 and said “this country is doomed”. I then tell her “um, yes it’s legal everywhere in America as of now” and then she says, “oh well you can get married at the courthouse and we can have a little party at my house after”. To which I was very confused and told her “mom, I’m going to have a wedding, I’m not asking you or Dad to pay for it or anything, but I am having a legitimate wedding, no different than anyone else.” She got kinda quiet and changed the subject and that’s the last we talked about it. It’s been a week now and I feel heartbroken and confused and hurt, so I ask the kind people of this thread, am I overreacting? Thanks!",0,1756180270.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.5,False
1n0br82,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1n0br82/i_need_advice_on_my_situation/,I need advice on my situation,"I need advice on what I should do. This is going to be a long post. 

I have lived with two of my friends who are in a relationship for the last 5 years. We moved across the country together from Florida to Oregon. They have been dating since before I knew them. Let's call them Rory (30FTM) and Alice (32F). I am a 28yo trans woman. 

I met Rory when I was 22 and had just moved to their city for college. I played drums and needed a coffee shop job, they got me a job and needed a drummer for their band. Perfect friendship start. They introduced me to Alice shortly after. I knew them probably 5 months before I moved in with them; I met them August of 2019 and moved in January of 2020. 

At the time, i had a lot of undiagnosed mental health issues. I come from a very strict religious family and hadn't really come to terms with a lot of my trauma. I also didn't know I was a trans woman when I first met them and identified with my birth gender. I will readily admit that for the first several years, I did not carry my weight in the household. I had a lot of out of control anxiety that I externalized on them, I didn't contribute my fair share to mental labor or house chores. I was lazy and unmotivated and they were unfairly impacted for years. We had a very codependent dynamic for a long time, it was unhealthy and imbalanced. Where I did not contribute equally, they (either consciously or unconsciously) regularly took advantage of the power dynamic between us, with them being a couple and always siding with each other and scapegoating me for things that weren't my fault. 

I absolutely did dumb shit during this time; I took shortcuts and didn't consider others and wasn't mindful or caring. I also had undiagnosed CPTSD and ADHD. It's no excuse but I was completely unaware of how my actions impacted others and I worried more about my own issues. 

After living together for two years, the three of us moved to Oregon together. We never could've made it individually, and we pooled our meager funds together to make it happen by the skin of our teeth. After we moved, things continued to be codependent. I started contributing more equally and also realized I was a trans woman. I took initiative and handled a lot of cleaning, we set up rotating meal cooking, I took responsibility for caring for our cats we had together. We were really in what you may call a platonic queer partnership altogether. I truly tried so hard, I got on adderall which changed my fucking life, got on HRT which also changed my life. Things were looking up. 

I still was grappling with severe trauma and basically spent all my free time alone in isolation. I had no desire to do things; I didn't look for new things to do in our new city, I went to the same three restaurants in rotation, and I never met a single other person here, even to this day. I've been in therapy and have been reckoning with this aspect of my trauma. Around this time, my friends started to belittle me for this. They would make comments about how I always went to the same restaurants, would go out to restaurants and make a big show out of not telling me what it was called because they wanted me to ""put in effort to find new things for them."" They would make comments about how I never planned outings or did spontaneous nice things for them. Admittedly, for most of the preceding years I would tag along with them on things they planned because they would invite me. I never invited myself and only went when they would ask, but I never planned things and ""returned the favor."" Truly that is because I wouldn't even plan things for myself to do, because my trauma often left me in freeze mode. 

The last year and a half I've done their dishes even though we've stopped sharing meals. I do their dishes, I take care of our cats, i clean, I do a lot of the chores and i tried so hard to go above and beyond to make up for my shortcomings. Even then, they would only ever bring up when I did something wrong. ""Why did you organize the cabinets this way, this isn't the way you should've organized them."" ""You forgot to refill the cats water one time out of a hundred."" ""You didn't put OUR stuff away right in the garage."" Just a constant focus on the wrong instead of any acknowledgement of my progress. I don't even want praise or anything I just want to stop being the subject of constant criticism and blows to my self esteem. 

For probably the last year and a half, they have treated me with what feels like disdain. I feel their lack of respect for me. They've called me pathetic, accused me of going behind their back to meet an old friend without telling them (they said it was because of Covid measures, we all still take it seriously), spied on my Bumble and made comments about my profile, constantly belittled me for aspects of my survival mode trauma responses, and they constantly remind me of past mistakes and how I've wronged them. They bring up me not contributing equally in years past. They constantly get mad if I walk in the kitchen when they are in there, even though it's the only way down to the laundry room. They just act so entitled to tell me what I can do even though we equally pay for this house. Rory regularly tells me that they think I make myself into the victim when I talk to my therapist, and tell me my monumental shame and guilt is ""my conscious telling me how terrible I've been to them."" 

For the last year, the dynamic has been markedly shifted. Pretty much a year ago I told them that I thought we shouldn't live together anymore because they seemed to want me to somehow repay this perceived debt and I didn't have the ability to do so, because I needed to take a step back to heal from my own trauma and move forward in my life. I feel like I've been fucking frozen for a year. I have grown a lot and I have changed a lot and healed some. But they still see me as this major oppressive force in their life, as some pathetic person who can't rise to their standards of friendship. 

Maybe I'm being one sided about it. I don't deny my part in all of it, I was a miserable fuck who did them dirty absolutely. I wish to god I had done different, but I'm also not going to browbeat myself anymore. I have been immeasurably cruel to myself internally and have internalized a lot of these things they've said about me, because I valued their opinions. They were the first queer and trans friends I ever had. It took me this whole year to stop seeing myself as a pathetic monster. 

Now here is my real current quandary. We are month to month on our lease. About four months ago, Alice got cancer and had to have two surgeries back to back. In the early days, before the diagnosis, I was having a mental health crisis. I went to a park with a gun and was going to do something drastic. I didn't. Instead, I came home and told them that I thought I needed to leave, because I couldn't stand being in this constant pressure, the feeling of just waiting for them to say something or call me out. Alice hadn't been officially diagnosed yet, and I wasn't thinking clearly. I told them I wanted to leave in a month. 

They got very upset at this, and legit the next day they were diagnosed with cancer. Truly that changed my choice, but they confronted me and told me that I'd betrayed their trust and ruined our friendships by telling them I'd leave. We had a big emotional conversation where I pretty much ceded everything and agreed to stay to help with their recovery. They had two surgeries and I resolved to handle all the house work so they could focus on their healing. They've since been declared cancer free. The dynamic is very tense now, with us hardly ever talking or spending any time together. They told me that this conversation caused an irreparable rift in our friendships. Truly, I thought me leaving was what they wanted based on how poorly they've treated me and how little they like or respect me. 

I just got a gender affirming surgery. I am essentially recovering alone, they've helped me very minimally. To be honest I don't really want them to help me at all if I can help it, I'd rather recover alone. We had a conversation before; they are trying to buy a house together and I wanted to recover from surgery in the same place instead of moving first then recovering in a new place alone. It is very ambiguous and we have not discussed a specific end date to this arrangement. I will be healed in four weeks time. There is no telling when they will find a house to buy. 

I have been presented with a housing opportunity with another drummer who owns a house with a separate attached unit. It seems like a perfect situation where I can be lowkey, get out of this insanely tense drama situation and finally start a new chapter of my life free from this frozen hell. They want me to move in November. I feel so certain that if I tell my current roommates/ex-friends about this that they will again accuse me of leaving them hanging out to dry, of not giving them enough notice or abandoning them in their time of need. They own way more stuff than I do and will have a much harder time moving. But honestly I am so tired of putting their interests ahead of mine. I understand that they need to put their own interests ahead of mine, but I'm finally in a place where I don't feel guilty and ashamed for saying that I need to put ME first. No one else will! 

And now I feel I have an impossible choice. I can accept this godsend housing offer and leave, and they will likely never forgive me for it and will view me as the villain in this situation, just another pathetic loser who ran from my problems and abandoned them. Or I can cede my own needs and stay here until they find a house to buy to alleviate their financial woes and help with house work. We aren't even friends anymore, we don't talk. So why do I feel so fucking guilty for wanting to leave? Am I wrong to want to go? Should I stay? It feels like a fucking lose lose situation no matter what I do and I want to scream. Sometimes I want to end it all I'm so frustrated and exasperated. I feel stupid. I feel like I'm being manipulated. Sometimes I feel like I'm the narcissist and I'm making it all up, but I'm not. I can't make up the way they've treated me. I admit my wrongs, but when I try to tell them how their words have severely impacted my self esteem, they tell me they don't have space to hear how they've hurt me given how much I've hurt them. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm at my wits end. My gut says to take this new housing opportunity and leave, and let them say whatever they want about me and never speak to them again. Why does it feel so hard and why do I feel so guilty?",1,1756180259.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

On the first date we went for a coffee while we were getting to know each other more, then we climbed this gorgeous hill within our city with some old ruin remains and even though it started raining HARD and we were getting soaked, she was like ""I like the rain so I wouldn't mind staying here"". Not gonna lie, getting soaked in the rain during a thunderstorm while sitting on a bench under a tree on top of a 200m high hill overlooking the city was fucking amazing and we stayed there for a good hour or maybe more. Afterwards we had dinner, I walked her home, we hugged and said our goodbyes after a 4h date. Finally I send her a message saying how I had a great time and that I'd love to do something similar again if she's down, to which she replied that she had a great time too and she'd be happy to go out with me again. She then added me on Instagram and we started talking there.

Two or three days later, I offered her to go out again but she said she's not sure if she'd be able this week as she's really busy as she both works and studies in university. I was cool with that and just said I'll offer something at some point next week.

Next week came and I reached out to her again, we texted a lil bit and I offered her to go for a walk in one of the local parks, and play some table tennis there as they have free to use tables and I have some paddles. She told me on the date before that she likes that so I went with it. She agreed so we went on a walk, played some table tennis, talked most of the time and during that talk, I jokingly brought up the fact that I was a bit surprised she agreed to go out on a second date, as I thought she might not have enjoyed the first date as much as I thought after she didn't try to reschedule anything after telling me she's busy after the first date.

She then explained that this is not the case and she's enjoying our dates, and that if she didn't she would literally just get up and leave on the spot. She mentioned how she'll be away for about a month visiting faimily and that we should go out again once she's back. Because of that, I assumed she'd reach out to me once she's back.

Also during that date, she said something that I found both surprising and endearing - we both talked how we love to travel and about the places we've been during our first date, so at one point during the second date she mentioned how she's going to Italy with a friend of hers and if I wanted to join them as more people will be merrier. Obviously I wasn't sure if she was joking or not since we barely knew each other at that point, but I jokingly answered that I'll be there if I get an invitation.

Now about a month and a half had passed, and I heard nothing back from her so this time I thought she was really not interested. Yesterday I was feeling kinda lonely so I recreated my account on the dating app and came across her, so I liked her for the lolz to see if she would too, and she did and send me a message saying ""Hello again stranger"".

Now I am wondering if I should offer her a third date even though we haven't seen each other or texted in over a month and a half. If she really wasn't interested why would she like me again and text me first?

Obviously I thought that maybe she might be enjoying being taken out to dates that are being paid for, but she offered to pay her half on the first date ( I refused ) and the second date was just hanging out at a park. Also I got to know her a little bit and she doesn't seem like that kind of person.

Maybe she's shy or under the impression that guys must take the initiative and put the effort in during the first dates?",2,1756180225.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I’m 37/m husband, father to 3 kids, combat veteran, and hard worker. 

Through the years my family life has been all but easy. In my childhood years I struggled with mom’s boyfriends, to include one through my high school years that would physically fight me, call me obscenities, and absolutely hated me. Ironically this is whom she is still with to this day. 
On the flip side, I’ve seen my dad three times since 2006 and by no choice of his own to come and visit. 
I think I finally give up, I let my mom have it today. She comes up with every reason in the fking world why she can’t be there for me or her grandkids. Well son it was too hot to leave the house, I can’t drive at night, I hurt my finger, you name it. Mind you she is 55 going on 85 years old. Anyways I finally called her out tonight because I am tired of it, she lives 12 miles from me and I see her maybe twice a year. It’s fucking insane. No help at all. We have never relied on her for anything period. 
After much conversation she replied “Fuck You” to me. 
I said to her, no way you just said that to me and hung up on her. 
She then text back with the following:

“I'm sorry I feel bad and was out of line . I should not have said what I said . I felt attacked and I get that from more than just you. I don't want you yelling at me.  If you think I'm happy in life think again.  I'm sorry my life isn't perfect. I was not off work for a year but thanks that would have been nice. I never bitched at my mom the way you do me. Hell I show up to the games and don't even feel welcome.  You are a grown ass man and you too have some responsibility to keep a relationship with me.  When was the last time you said hey mom come have coffee with me and the kids. I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.” 

Then this 

“Well looks like it will be a tough night. My mind is racing a million miles a minute. I love you son and always have.  Again I'm sorry but you have no idea what I have been going through maybe because you don't call and ask.  I'm going to bed. Have a good night.  Love you very much”

It’s wild, never in a million years would I envision my own mom saying fuck you to me.

I’m from Germany but stay in Seattle and will maybe end up living here. I would like to meet up with people. I'm weird, like psychology and I'm up for so many different things. I like being vulnerable and I do not like judging people. I try to be as open minded as possible and see so much beauty in this world. We can go dumpster diving or go to a park and just lie down. We can also talk on the phone and talk about all the things that bother us in this world. The current state of the world sure bothers me. I find it hard to connect. I don't think I'm picky, I'm just complicated yet simple - an oxymoron, perhaps? I'm not perfect, so I don't expect you to be perfect. I think that sounds pretty fair. I like coffee, cycling, enjoying the little things, being spontaneous, going to parks, playing some games here and there, movies/tv shows, books, exploring different things. I like so much. I also love people and how different we all are. I know I want to find friends for seattle and I desperately want to connect since I find it hard to do. I like doing boring things as well. I’m a bit socially awkward with extroversion and sarcasm sprinkled in lol

I'm so willing to understand everything and think we have so much to offer. Whatever you want to do, try me. My humor is dry and dark but can be awkward and silly as well. I will admit that I'm introverted but I can be extroverted as well. I'm constantly trying to grow and be better. I want to treat people good and be good to myself as well.

I also like roasted salted peanut butter.

I'm new to moka pot, and i have a few other questions beside the gasket one. I Got the 6 cup bialatti express and even though I haven't brewed with it yet, I did run water through it a few times to boil and clean it, but I kept smelling burning rubber after pouring out the water. I finally realized it was the bottom chamber burning the rubber gasket, causing the smell.

 The first few times I boiled I just had my electric stove on max to boil quickly but the third time I had it on med, then let simmer after the initial 'burst' as I read this is what you're meant to do when brewing coffee. The smell still came about doing this method as well, and this was after i had let the pot sit for a few hours to get rid of the initial smell.

I should mention I am used to just boiling water and doing pour over coffee since it's quick and tastes good. But I can't tell if I'm doing this wrong or the rubber gasket is just a terrible design flaw. If I need to replace it, so be it, but I didn't think this device would be so high maintenance.

3. **Mobile responsiveness** - Still working on this one...
4. **Performance optimization** - V1 was slower than dial-up internet

## 🙏 Roast Me (Constructively Please)
As a complete noob, I know there's room for improvement:
- UI/UX could be better?
- Missing any crucial features?
- Anything that makes you want to rage quit?
- Did I pick the wrong tech stack?

## 💸 Business Model? What's That?
Currently running on some ads to cover hosting costs, all features are free  
Maybe in the future:
- Premium features?
- Enterprise custom solutions?
- Other monetization ideas? (help me brainstorm!)

## 🎉 Small Victories
- Server hasn't crashed yet (thanks Cloudflare!)
- Got a few nice user emails (almost cried)
- Everything actually works as intended (mostly)

1n0bg1k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0bg1k,"The ""Zero-Based Budgeting"" (ZBB) Myth for Startups: Why It Fails and What to Do Instead","Hey there, fellow entrepreneur. Let's talk about something that can feel both incredibly empowering and utterly terrifying: your startup's budget. It's the financial roadmap that guides your decisions, fuels your growth, and, if we're being honest, probably keeps you up at night more often than you'd like to admit.

For years, the gold standard in the corporate world has been **Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB)**. The concept is simple and, on the surface, incredibly logical. Instead of basing this year's budget on last year's, you start from zero. Every single expense, from paper clips to payroll, must be justified and approved. It’s a rigorous, meticulous process designed to eliminate waste and ensure every dollar has a purpose. For a Fortune 500 company looking to trim the fat, it can be a game-changer.

But for a startup? It’s a different story. Applying ZBB to a fledgling business is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. It’s not just inefficient; it can be actively detrimental to your growth. This isn't just a controversial take; it's a reality check for founders who are trying to navigate the choppy waters of early-stage business. Let's break down the ZBB myth for startups, explore why it so often fails, and, most importantly, discuss what you should do instead.

# The Allure of ZBB: Why It Seems Like a Good Idea

Before we dismantle the ZBB pedestal, let's acknowledge why it's so tempting. As a startup founder, you are the ultimate guardian of your company's resources. Every penny counts. The idea of scrutinizing every expense and building a budget from the ground up feels like the pinnacle of financial responsibility. It promises:

* **Unmatched Cost Control:** In a world where cash is king, ZBB offers the tantalizing prospect of plugging every financial leak.
* **Strategic Alignment:** By forcing you to justify every line item, ZBB ensures that your spending is directly tied to your business goals.
* **A Culture of Accountability:** It encourages your team to think critically about their spending and to take ownership of their departmental budgets.

These are all fantastic goals. The problem isn't with the *intent* of ZBB; it's with its rigid methodology and how it clashes with the fundamental nature of a startup.

# The Reality Check: Why ZBB Fails in a Startup Environment

Startups operate in a state of constant flux. You're building the plane while flying it, and your budget needs to be a flexible tool, not a rigid cage. Here’s where the ZBB framework starts to crumble under the weight of startup reality.

**1. The Volatility Factor: Your Crystal Ball is Broken**

ZBB requires a level of predictability that startups simply don't have. How can you justify a specific marketing spend for the next 12 months when you don't even know which customer acquisition channel will prove most effective in the next three? You might plan to hire two developers in Q3, but what happens when a sudden opportunity requires you to bring on a sales lead in Q1 instead?

* **Example:** Imagine a SaaS startup budgeting for the year. They use ZBB and allocate a precise amount for content marketing based on creating four blog posts a month. In month two, they discover that their target audience responds incredibly well to short-form video. The ZBB model makes it difficult to pivot. Reallocating funds requires a complex re-justification process, slowing down their ability to capitalize on a crucial discovery. The opportunity cost of this inflexibility can be massive.

**2. The Time Suck: Your Most Precious Resource**

Let's be blunt: ZBB is incredibly time-consuming. It requires deep-dive analysis, lengthy justification reports, and multiple rounds of review. For a large corporation with dedicated finance teams, this is manageable. For a startup founder who is also the CEO, head of sales, and chief coffee-maker, it's a recipe for burnout.

* **Best Practice Tip:** Your time is your most valuable non-renewable resource. Any process you implement should save you time, not drain it. If your budgeting process is taking more than a few focused hours each month, it's too complicated.

**3. Stifling Innovation and Opportunism**

The very essence of a startup is to be nimble, to experiment, and to seize opportunities as they arise. ZBB, with its pre-approved, justified-to-the-hilt expense list, is the enemy of spontaneity. It discourages experimentation because any ""unplanned"" expense is seen as a deviation from the master plan.

* **Example:** A hardware startup gets an unexpected invitation to present at a major industry conference. The cost of travel and a booth wasn't in the zero-based budget. The process to get it approved could take weeks, by which time the opportunity might have passed. A more flexible system would allow the founder to make a quick, strategic decision to allocate funds, recognizing the potential for a huge ROI.

**4. The Fallacy of Starting from ""Zero""**

For a brand-new company, ""zero"" is your literal starting point for everything. You have no historical data. You're making educated guesses about customer acquisition costs, sales cycles, and operational expenses. Justifying these expenses from a ""zero"" baseline is an exercise in creative writing, not financial planning. You're defending assumptions, not analyzing proven costs.

# The Smarter Startup Way: Flexible Budgeting Alternatives

So, if ZBB is out, what's in? The key is to shift your mindset from rigid **cost control** to dynamic financial management. You need a system that provides visibility and accountability without sacrificing speed and flexibility. Here are three powerful alternatives.

**1. The ""Rolling Forecast"" Method**

This is perhaps the most effective model for early-stage startups. Instead of creating a static 12-month budget, you create a 3-to-6 month forecast that you continuously update.

* **How it Works:** At the end of each month, you review your performance against the forecast. What did you get right? What was way off? Based on this new data, you adjust the next few months and add a new month to the end of your forecast. So, in January, you might have a forecast for Jan-Mar. At the end of January, you'll create a new forecast for Feb-Apr.
* **Why it Works for Startups:**
   * **Adaptability:** It allows you to react to new information in real-time.
   * **Reduces Guesswork:** Your forecast becomes more accurate over time as it's based on recent, relevant data.
   * **Forward-Looking:** It keeps you focused on the immediate future, which is where you can have the most impact.
* **Pro Tip:** Use a simple spreadsheet or a tool like QuickBooks or Xero to manage your rolling forecast. Don't overcomplicate it. Track your key metrics: cash in, cash out, and runway (how many months you can survive with the cash you have).

**2. The ""Key Drivers"" Budget**

Instead of budgeting for every single line item, focus on the key drivers of your business. These are the 3-5 metrics that have the biggest impact on your revenue and costs.

* **How it Works:** Identify your most critical business drivers. For a SaaS company, this might be new customer trials, conversion rate, and customer churn. For an e-commerce business, it could be website traffic, conversion rate, and average order value. Your budget is then built around influencing these drivers. For example, ""We will spend 'X' on ads to generate 'Y' amount of traffic, assuming a 'Z'% conversion rate.""
* **Why it Works for Startups:**
   * **Simplicity:** It cuts through the noise and focuses your attention on what truly matters.
   * **Strategic Focus:** It directly links your spending to your growth engine.
   * **Empowers Your Team:** You can give your team goals based on these drivers (e.g., ""Marketing's goal is to generate 500 trials this month"") and the autonomy to spend their budget as they see fit to achieve that goal.

**3. The ""Bare Bones + Variable"" Approach**

This is a hybrid model that provides a safety net while still allowing for flexibility.

* **How it Works:**
   * **Bare Bones:** First, calculate your absolute essential monthly costs—the ""keep the lights on"" budget. This includes salaries, rent, essential software subscriptions, etc. This part of your budget is relatively fixed.
   * **Variable:** The rest of your cash is treated as a variable or ""growth"" fund. This is the money you can use for experiments and opportunities. You can allocate this on a monthly or quarterly basis based on your strategic priorities.
* **Why it Works for Startups:**
   * **Manages Risk:** You always know your baseline survival cost, which is crucial for managing your cash runway.
   * **Encourages Experimentation:** It carves out a specific pool of money for testing new ideas without jeopardizing the core business.
   * **Simple to Manage:** The fixed portion requires minimal monthly management, freeing you up to think strategically about how to deploy your variable funds.

# Best Practices for Any Startup Budgeting Method

Regardless of which framework you choose, these universal principles will help you stay on track.

* **Cash is King:** Your budget's number one job is to help you manage your cash flow. Always know your burn rate (how much cash you're spending each month) and your runway.
* **Review, Review, Review:** A budget is a living document. Set a recurring monthly meeting (even if it's just with yourself) to review your financials.
* **Involve Your Team:** Be transparent about the company's financial goals. When your team understands the ""why"" behind the budget, they're more likely to make smart spending decisions.
* **Don't Confuse a Budget with a Forecast:** A budget is a plan for where you *want* your money to go. A forecast is your best guess of where it *will* actually go. Use both. Your budget sets the goals; your forecast tracks your progress against them.

The allure of **Zero-Based Budgeting** is understandable. It speaks to the part of every founder that craves order, control, and fiscal prudence. But for a startup, true fiscal prudence isn't about rigid control; it's about intelligent flexibility. It's about having a financial framework that empowers you to learn, adapt, and seize the fleeting opportunities that will define your success.

Don't fall into the trap of adopting corporate best practices that don't fit your reality. Your startup is a unique, dynamic entity. Your approach to budgeting should be too. Ditch the ZBB myth, embrace a more flexible approach, and get back to what you do best: building a business that matters.

Trans feelings obviously persisted with the typical bottom dysphoria until I decided its not something I can run away from and I will just be a woman who wears more masculine clothing, clothing that feels comfortable no matter what. I usually like to wear my tight dry fit sports shirts that feel really good on the body, coded male because no ridiculously open neck hole or ultra short sleeves and then male knee length shorts because I cant imagine ever wearing anything else that feels comfortable, i rly dislike yoga pants or those ultra tight/short women's shorts. I dislike anything that feels restricting as well hence why male shorts have felt the best.

Oh i am also on the fat/chubby side so I definitely dont have tomboy vibes, I do love my body so that wont be changing either, it feels nice to have a more sizeable mass, feels safer.

My body was always on the more feminine and curvy side so was my face, so after even only a year of HRT, face, boobs, body shape are pretty much on the female side. The shirt is also on the tighter side so my boobs doesnt cant be confused for moobs 

How I know this is caused by the clothes?

Mostly because I do frequently get gendered female at work since work clothing isnt gendered so they have to rely on face, and somewhat the voice but voice is hit or miss currently.

There's times at coffee places that they go ""Hello sir"", then when they are up close and see my face they go ""sorry, mam"", so its pretty clear they gender me male due to the clothes which I find absurd we live in a society that finds something as casual as a tshirt and shorts is seen as ""male""

This will of course not change since I am not going to wear uncomfortable clothing just to signal to randoms I am a woman but it can feel a bit annoying, my only plan currently is to go for a more clearly feminine voice in hopes its clear but that takes a lot of work so in progress.",3,1756178759.0,butchlesbians,2,0.71,False

On **August 17**, I was riding a long-planned bucket-list route from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. At around **2:45 PM**, on **E Hueneme Rd in Oxnard**, a grey pickup pulled out of a side street and cut me off at the very last second. I had no choice but to swerve off the road - I went down hard and broke my femur.  

This is the exact location of the crash: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/VKZ8vHwxbwDQNePh6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VKZ8vHwxbwDQNePh6)

The driver saw me coming. We locked eyes as he pulled into the road. At first it looked like he would just keep going and I could shout at him and carry on, but instead he stopped dead across the lane, blocking the entire road. I still wonder: was he expecting me to hit his truck? Was he trying to scare me? Whatever the intent, after I hit the ground, he left me on the ground and drove away.  

I couldn’t grab my phone fast enough for a plate, given the shock from the hard fall. All I can share is this:  

\- Grey pickup, Tacoma-sized (possibly Toyota or GMC)  

\- Older male driver, shaved/bald head, short grey beard  

\- Gaunt, hollow-cheeked face with an angry expression  

The road was otherwise empty. I thought I was “safe” out there with a tailwind at 40 km/h (\~25 mph). One driver changed all that in an instant.

Thankfully, a good Samaritan coming from the opposite direction stopped and called 911. Others pulled over too, keeping me talking while we waited. The first responders were stellar, to me it felt like forever, but they were there within minutes and took great care until I was admitted to Ventura County Medical Center.  

I know this technically isn’t a “hit-and-run” since there was no contact, but the driver’s actions **caused the crash** and he drove away while I was injured on the ground. That part hurts as much as the injury itself.

I was lucky this time. I’ll recover, and I’ll ride again. But it could have been worse, much worse. And that’s the bigger issue: these kinds of reckless, angry interactions with cyclists happen every day. We shouldn’t have to accept being pushed off the road like we don’t matter.  

So I wanted to put this out there:  

\- In case anyone local saw something (dashcam, witness, even a detail that rings a bell). 

\- To make this story visible, because cycling safety needs all the attention it can get. 



I’ve also set up a GoFundMe to help cover medical bills and replace destroyed gear. I’m not great at asking for money, even a kind word or a “virtual coffee” is already a huge boost. Anything beyond my recovery will go toward cycling advocacy and road safety initiatives.

Now, we're about to get married.","Hello reddit, had to use throwaway since our  friends use reddit. This is also my first time posting here after years of lurking and just reading stories and thought that I should share this here.

So, this all started three years ago. I was a newbie in this company and was put in a team of married or with partners and me and the this guy on the team, let's call him Perry, was the only single people. 

One lunch, the women on the team were gossiping about this celeb turned vegan and how they could never imagine themselves giving up meat forever. Then they asked what I thought about it. I panicked and blurted out ""Oh, I'm pescetarian."" (not a total lie since I had tried it for about three months before but I failed miserably. and no, they hadn't seen me eat meat since I only drink coffee or eat protein bar during lunch.) That's when Perry perked up and started being interested at the fact that I'm the first person he met with that kind of lifestyle. For context, Perry wasn't exactly the most talkative person in our team, so everyone (especially the older women) was so shocked to see him so interested and including himself in the conversation.

Of course seeing Perry so interested in talking to me, the married women immediately started shipping us. And as a newbie, I didn't want to ruin the fun, so I just smiled, laughed at their jokes and sometimes even jokingly flirted back. Perry and I started hanging out because of this lie and he would often ask me about ""pescetarian lifestyle"". What I eat, where I buy my ingredients, how I resist meat and if I have tips on how to start. He said that he's interested in this because he wanted to try it himself but doesn't know if he can really commit. I felt so guilty because the whole thing started as a lie... but at the same time, it gave me a reason to keep talking to him.

One thing led to another, and eventually we started dating and seven months after being official, we moved in together. Perry is a loving partner and an AMAZING cook. He researched pescetarian recipes and would make all these meals for me. One time I said I missed the taste of bacon, and he made me vegan bacon out of spring roll wrappers. I felt so fricking guilty but at the same time, I thought this is the push I need to finally commit.

One morning, I woke up to the smell of real bacon. Perry was making two separate breakfasts and I swear, the smell of bacon sizzling in the pan broke me. I walked into the kitchen and joked, ""Smells good. Can I try?"" and followed it with ""Just kidding!"". He just smiled and said ""You can try."" He wasn't even pushy about it, but my weak weak self gave in immediately. I pretended that it was the first time in forever I'd tasted bacon. From then on, he started casually offering me meat dishes and asking if it was okay. I always use the excuse that I want to keep eating everything he cooks so yeah... I kept giving in.

Now, whenever we meet up with our friends, he brags about how he ""converted"" me back to eating meat. And here we are, three years later, engaged, and getting married in three months. Do I confess?",8,1756178077.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.72,False

Long story short: in Spring, I 'met' someone in an online writer's group. I googled her name and found out that she had written some utterly unique books and that she regularly published these incredible pieces on Medium. They were(and are) unlike anything I'd ever read: funny, poetic, filled with stunning wordplay, and sometimes quite disturbing. I subscribed - I think I was her first subscriber - she wrote me back to thank me, and we ended up doing some writing together (virtually). In the course of that she shared some things with me about her background that, for personal reasons, fascinated me, and I realized that I wanted nothing more than to meet her. But when I finally worked up the nerve to ask her out (for coffee or tea - Ms. D. Parker, would you like to go visit a cat cafe?, JFC, stupid, stupid STUPID!), she said she was 'happily isolating - writing, working,' she cited 'family stuff.' She said she was happy to keep texting though.

For the past 3-4 months, we've supported each other's Medium writing with 'likes' and occasional comments. The thing is, between what little I know about her and the occasional personal things she shares in her published writing, I have, admittedly, become infatuated with her. I don't think about her 24/7, but when I do for too long, it is painful. Really, debilitatingly painful. It feels like I have a crush on a ghost. I explained this to a friend, and she introduced me to the term 'limerence.'

I just turned on 2 different YouTube videos by LCSWs who state that one of the criteria for whether something is 'love' (which this obviously isn't, I've never even met her) or 'limerance' is, ""Are you sincerely interested in getting to know the person (an unequivocal ""yes!"" in my case) or are you happy to just keep fantasizing about them?""

I do *not* want to keep fantasizing. I am well aware that I've built an un-live-up-toable ideal in my head. How could I not? She's a freaking genius with a a wickedly subversive sense of humor! But she has also been nothing but kind in her texts to me, in her comments on my writing, in her responses to my absurd fanboy-ish comments on hers (""I love the way you think"" - stupid, stupid, STUPID!). I feel like meeting her would make her a regular human being  - which is who she is, and this is why I hate the term ""limerent object."" Would I be a nervous wreck were she to agree? Probably, but I'd survive that. 

I ask only one thing: be gentle. I am fragile as fuck right now.

Thank you.",3,1756177629.0,limerence,7,1.0,False

Kept decreasing the grind size down until 13. I think I'll stick to 13 clicks. Drawdown takes around 3 minutes, double the recommended time. Nice sweetness, better flavour than 16 clicks. Does taste a wee bit sweeter than the V60.

 They may not be dazzling, but they are full of possibilities, guiding us to slow down, embrace the beauty of restraint, and find warmth and meaning in every moment.

1.	Magic Forest
Thick emerald and cobalt blue blend deep in the coniferous forest, like emeralds forged by dwarves in Norse mythology, with millennia-old frost clinging to their surface. This mysterious, profound green tone carries its own narrative tension, evoking the secrecy of the forest and the harmony of nature.

2.	Desert Sun
It merges the heat of scorching sand grains with a faint retro hue, as if slightly faded by time and intense heat. The mix of warm brown and rich orange calls to mind sunsets over sand dunes. In autumn and winter wardrobes, it will shine as a warm highlight.

3.	Lavender Blue
A hybrid of pre-dawn mist and newly blooming lavender in Provence, like violets bleached by moonlight.
It carries echoes of the passing summer, the chill of morning frost, and the soft glow of overcast winter days. This light, airy blue-purple tone brings a sense of tranquility and peace.

4.	Hot Chocolate
Imagine savoring rich red wine and delicious dark chocolate by a winter fireplace, where embers of unextinguished charcoal flicker. This alluring, thick brown tone with deep wine-red undertones evokes a velvety texture and warm comfort.

5.	Bronze Fog
A Western Zhou jue cup (ancient wine vessel) stands shrouded in morning mist, with bluish-green rust breathing on its bronze surface—imbued with the coziness of a cold morning. This is a classic autumn color: a noble metallic tone with a soft sheen, balancing warmth and refinement, and a worthy companion to coffee and green hues.",6,1756177489.0,LuxuryRepsBags,3,1.0,False

My fiance and I had never been to Vegas together and decided it was time to go for a long weekend. Neither of us are big gamblers but we like to eat and drink and enjoy being around the controlled chaos of the Strip.

Thursday:

Flew out of LAX, our flight was Southwest so no assigned seats (yet!), recommend sitting on the left side for this flight as it provides a great view of the strip as you approach the airport. The flight was short so no drink service.



We were staying at the Wynn. Amazing lobby with beautiful floral arrangements and easy, fast check-in. The front desk was very friendly and got us a room on the top floor. Seems like this was an advantage of checking in on a weekday as Friday onwards things got much busier. We were really happy with our room, a king panoramic view. It had a great view, but since the Wynn is so far north you don’t really get the classic strip view; if anything, it’s a great view of the Trump tower (lol). We loved the room itself: Alexa capabilities for lights and automatic curtains, beautiful marble bathroom with nightlights underneath separate double vanity sinks. Everything felt high-end, solid, and well-maintained. The tub had a middle spout which was a nice touch, bed was extremely comfortable (we both like firmer mattresses which this was), blackout curtains great, a little hallway noise but nothing we found problematic. No mini fridge, but we later found out that the hotel will deliver one for $25 for the entire stay.



We walked over to the Venetian and wandered around the canal shops with a big beer which was fun and great people watching. Dinner at Sushi Samba. Kobe beef gyozas and rock shrimp tempura were great. They recommended their signature “Samba Vegas” roll which for $42 we felt was nothing special, it was a small crispy rice roll with spicy tuna. Sea bass robata was also small and fine but nothing special. We left dinner not feeling totally full after 2 apps and 2 “entrees” which is unusual for us, we usually have leftovers when we dine out. 



On to Dita Von Teese at the Voltaire theatre. Beautiful art deco venue and Dita was amazing — she looked great (I’d seen her perform over 20 years ago in New Orleans), her dancing was impeccable and graceful, fun set pieces and acts. We’d definitely recommend this show and try to sit as close as possible as it makes a big difference.



After the show we went to Fontainebleau, it was fine but didn’t have a lot of character and kind of felt like a convention center. We had a drink at the lobby bar, then went across the street to Circus Circus, which was dead and looking pretty rough inside. We walked back to the Wynn–it was around midnight and still nearly 100 degrees outside! The only place still serving food was the Encore lobby bar; we ordered pizza and cheeseburger sliders which were surprisingly good and fun people watching there.



Friday:

Got a late start, went to Mon Ami Gabi for lunch. Our first time walking through Paris, we enjoyed it and thought they did a good job with the theme. At Mon Ami Gabi we sat just inside from the patio, nice view of the Bellagio/strip and shockingly cool despite being open to the outside and it being well over 100 degrees out. French onion soup and baguette with carrots were the standouts. Quiche and heirloom tomato salad were okay. The atmosphere was great and it felt like being transported to a Parisian cafe.



After lunch we walked to the Bellagio and walked through the conservatory. The Bellagio and the conservatory in particular feel like a prototype of the Wynn, as though the designers took the best parts and then took them to the next level at the Wynn: the flower arrangements, colorful floor inlays, and whimsical design. On to the Cosmo next, we walked in through the mall/food court which is open in the center to the Chandelier bar, a three-story bar decorated to look like a giant chandelier. The concept was very cool but we didn’t like how the bar was basically surrounded by a noisy mall and food court. We headed to the Ski Lodge, a speakeasy next to the Superfrico restaurant. We loved this spot. Inside the bar looks like a mountain chalet with each wall modeled after a different iconic ski location (Cloud 9 in Aspen, Bar Gyu in Hokkaido, and a Swiss chalet). Drinks were good and we loved the theme, they did a great job, would love to come back here.



That night we went to O at the Bellagio. The acrobatics were amazing and the water stage was incredible. We realized neither of us is really a cirque person, but if you are it’s a great show in a very cool venue. After the show we had 45 minutes to kill before dinner and we went to the Vault, a hidden bar in the middle of the busy casino floor. Beautiful art deco design, it felt like a quiet oasis in the middle of the packed casino. Drink prices were shocking, even by Vegas standards (only one sub-$40 cocktail on the menu; some others are “market price”). Very cool space. They do provide delicious complimentary bar snacks and two small welcome drinks with a dry ice display. The prices were so outrageous we actually got a kick out of looking through the menu; it was like absurdist performance art. Hot tip: we ordered an off-menu drink (penicillin) which was “only” $34. Overall we felt like the experience was a good value because we enjoyed it so much and didn’t order from the menu; we walked out paying less than $100 which honestly including the snacks and complimentary drink is near what you’d pay at most other nice casino bars. 



Dinner at Mayfield Supper Club. This place was insanely fun. There is a main stage and performers like contortionists, disco dancers, and singers, all encouraging audience participation. We loved our table (#123) as we got a great view of the Bellagio fountain show and the performances. We ordered the wedge salad, caviar service, and split the filet mignon which were all delicious (and plenty of food for two). It was a great meal and a fun memorable show wrapped up in one. Highly recommend this place especially if you are coming to the Bellagio to see O! 



After that, we took the tram and walked to the Waldorf Astoria. This hotel feels tucked away and quiet despite being in the middle of the strip as it doesn’t have gaming and is non-smoking. Hard Shake (formerly Skybar) is their newly-remodeled bar overlooking the strip. Great views, swanky, and the cocktails were strong. We took them to go and walked along the strip a little more before heading back for the night. It was still literally 100 degrees out!



Saturday:

We searched for a breakfast place in the Wynn, everywhere had a long line (Jardin and Terrace Point Cafe were both over an hour wait, next time we’ll make reservations) so we grabbed coffee to go from Al Theatro (only moderately overpriced by Vegas standards at $9 each). A little later we headed to the arts district for lunch and more caffeination at Iwana Specialty Coffee Roasters which was great, highly recommend. Took a short walk to Stray Pirate for some tiki drinks. The decor/atmosphere there is insane, probably the most well-done tiki bar we’ve ever visited, great drinks too.



Our dinner that night was at Mizumi in the Wynn. We grabbed a quick pre-dinner drink at the Living Room, a new speakeasy concept right downstairs from Mizumi. They made a great dirty martini. It had a sexy Vegas library vibe with scantily clad servers and a prominent sign outside warning that lewd behavior will not be tolerated which made us think it must be a particular issue there. We enjoyed it, but frankly it wasn’t on the same level as the Vault or the Ski Lodge for themed speakeasies.



Then dinner at Mizumi. Oh boy. The positives first: decor in the dining room was beautiful and well-done and there was a nice outdoor area with a waterfall. The drink presentation was unique and elegant. And that’s about it. We were extremely underwhelmed and disappointed with our meal. Prices were outrageous as expected, but the quality and portion sizes were egregious. Ordered the blue crab and yellowtail rolls, and shrimp/veggie tempura, all of which were fine but small, nothing special, and priced 2-3x what they’d cost at a normal nice sushi restaurant. The drinks, while being presented nicely in an ornate wooden box and sake serving set, were weak. We got their version of a dirty martini, called the Mujo. In all honesty it tasted like salty water with a hint of sake. So not good. We love dirtys and have had lots of them ranging in price and quality and this was one of the worst. Only $20 though so at least we weren’t upset about the price by Vegas standards.



Now, for our entree: the $88 “A5 wagyu fried rice”, which we were told explicitly had 2 ounces of A5 wagyu. This dish was literally a bowl of rice with an egg topping, with the worst throw away scraps that may or may not have been from an actual A5 wagyu steak—it was impossible to tell. The scraps were chewy and fatty, nothing like typical A5. We called the server, who agreed with us immediately that this was not A5 quality (she didn’t seem that surprised, guessing it’s not the first time someone has complained about this). She offered to replace the dish but we were over it at that point. We feel that this dish is literally offered to monetize the scraps left over from their featured wagyu steaks ($70/oz, 3 oz minimum) and is basically a scam. We understand Vegas is expensive but at least we expect delivery of goods promised. This felt straight up dishonest and undermined our confidence that they cared about delivering a quality experience. The desert was a boring wafer cookie for $28. We thought about asking them to comp our drinks or dessert and decided it wasn’t worth the effort. A better establishment would’ve immediately offered something since there was clearly a huge service gap here. We left unhappy and underwhelmed.



After dinner we went up to Fremont street, our first time there. The lights and energy were fun, we enjoyed the music and walking down the street.



Sunday:

Brunch at Terrace Point Cafe, we were very happy with our meal there, got a couple of bloody marys which were great too. We then headed to the pool at the Wynn. The pool was really nice, landscaped, and a good 10 degrees cooler than the actual weather outside due to all the trees and foliage around. There were plenty of cabana chairs and free beach towels. We really liked the pool; there were quite a few people in it so we only got in briefly but it was a nice area. 

Headed to Mat Franco’s magic comedy show at the Linq that evening. Mat Franco was funny and a true professional in terms of the energy and comedy he brought on stage. We especially enjoyed his sleight of hand tricks. This show is family friendly and less raunchy than other acts we heard about. Would recommend it for sure.

After Mat Franco, we went to Delilah back at the Wynn for our dinner reservation. Honestly it was another disappointing Wynn experience. The restaurant decor itself is really cool, like a 1950s/art deco speakeasy lounge, with a live band and singer. However, we were seated at one of the only tables behind the stage without a view of the performance, so we couldn’t see anything except everyone else watching and enjoying the show. We’d specifically requested a table with a view of the stage in our reservation so this was especially disappointing. The manager was nice about it but couldn’t switch our table, so we decided to leave before spending another $400-500 on a dinner that didn’t even really include the entertainment.

We took a 10-minute Uber ride to Chubby Cattle in Chinatown, an AYCE Japanese BBQ and sushi restaurant known for their wagyu. We enjoyed our dinner here and prices were super reasonable, especially after the strip. Headed back to the strip and got dropped off at the CVS near the Waldorf. We grabbed a couple of $4 beers (!) and walked the strip all the way back to the Wynn. We stopped by the Barbershop speakeasy in the Cosmopolitan, which had a great band and fun vibe. Headed onwards to Caesars Palace. That place is a trip, it was our first time inside and we loved it! So over the top with Roman statues everywhere and giant chandeliers, definitely feels like glitzy old Vegas. It was a little cooler than the other nights and we loved just walking outside and feeling the energy of the strip.



Monday:

Quick coffee and snack at the hotel before heading to the airport. In retrospect, we really splurged on this trip and felt like we did pretty much everything we wanted to do in Vegas. It was really fun as we are a couple of DINKs and could do this now; we don’t plan on necessarily having this type of trip to Vegas again.



Highlights: 

Wynn panoramic king, Dita Von Teese, Ski Lodge, the Vault, Mayfield Supper Club, walking the strip with a couple of beers and seeing the sights

Would do differently:

Request minifridge at the beginning of the trip and stock up on snacks / beer / water from CVS, consider Tower Suites at the Wynn if going on the weekend due to crowds (it often took 10+ minutes to get back up to our room due to slow elevators and having to make several other stops), eat more meals off the strip

With so much to do, it can be tempting to let your financial record-keeping slide into a shoebox of receipts, hoping your accountant will sort it out later.

But what if I told you that hidden within your numbers is the very story of your business—its past, its present, and its potential future? Understanding this story is the single most powerful thing you can do to take control of your company’s destiny. It’s the difference between reacting to problems and proactively building a resilient, profitable enterprise.

This is where the **3-statement model** comes in.

It sounds intimidating, but it’s just a fancy term for how three key financial reports—the **Profit & Loss Statement**, the **Balance Sheet**, and the **Cash Flow Statement**—work together to give you a complete picture of your business's health. Think of them as three different camera angles on your business. One shows your performance over time, another gives you a snapshot of your financial position at a single moment, and the last tracks your cash. Together, they provide a 360-degree view.

This guide is your jargon-free zone. We’re going to break down each statement, show you how they connect, and give you practical tips to use them. This isn’t just about accounting; it’s about becoming a more confident, data-driven leader.

# Camera Angle 1: The Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement — Are You Making Money?

The Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement, also known as the Income Statement, is probably the report you’re most familiar with. Its purpose is simple: to tell you whether your business was **profitable** over a specific period (like a month, a quarter, or a year).

Think of it like a scoreboard for your business. It starts with all the money you brought in (revenue) and subtracts all the money you spent (expenses) to arrive at your ultimate score: your **net income** (or loss).

**The P&L Formula:** Revenue - Expenses = Net Income (Profit or Loss)

Let's break down the key components:

# 1. Revenue (or Sales)

This is your top line—the total amount of money you’ve earned from selling your products or services. It’s the gross amount, before any expenses are taken out.

* **Example:** If you own a coffee shop and sold $20,000 worth of coffee, pastries, and merchandise in a month, your revenue for that month is $20,000.

# 2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

COGS represents the **direct costs** of producing the goods or services you sold. If you sell a physical product, this includes raw materials and direct labor. If you’re a service business, it might be the cost of software or contractors directly tied to a client project.

* **Example (Coffee Shop):** Your COGS would be the cost of coffee beans, milk, sugar, cups, and the wages of the baristas who make the drinks. Let's say this was $6,000.

Subtracting COGS from Revenue gives you your **Gross Profit**. $20,000 (Revenue) - $6,000 (COGS) = **$14,000 (Gross Profit)**

Your Gross Profit tells you how much money you have left over to cover your other business expenses.

# 3. Operating Expenses (OpEx)

These are the costs required to run your business that are *not* directly tied to producing a specific product. They are the day-to-day overhead.

Common categories include:

* **Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A):** Rent, utilities, marketing costs, salaries for administrative staff, office supplies, insurance.
* **Research & Development (R&D):** Costs associated with developing new products.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):** Your operating expenses would be your rent ($3,000), marketing flyers ($500), utilities ($700), and your salary as the manager ($4,000). Total OpEx = $8,200.

Subtracting OpEx from Gross Profit gives you your **Operating Income**. $14,000 (Gross Profit) - $8,200 (OpEx) = **$5,800 (Operating Income)**

This is a crucial number. It shows the profit your business generated from its core operations, before accounting for things like interest and taxes.

# 4. Non-Operating Items & Taxes

* **Interest Expense:** The cost of any debt you have (e.g., a business loan).
* **Taxes:** The income taxes your business owes.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):** Let's say you paid $300 in interest on a loan and your income tax was $1,500.

# 5. Net Income (The Bottom Line)

This is it—the final number. After you subtract all your expenses from your revenue, you’re left with your net income.

$5,800 (Operating Income) - $300 (Interest) - $1,500 (Taxes) = **$4,000 (Net Income)**

**Best Practice:** Don't just look at your net income. Analyze your margins. Your **gross profit margin** ($14,000 / $20,000 = 70%) tells you if your products are priced correctly. Your **net profit margin** ($4,000 / $20,000 = 20%) shows your overall profitability. Tracking these over time is essential.

# Camera Angle 2: The Balance Sheet — What’s Your Net Worth?

If the P&L is a video of your performance over time, the Balance Sheet is a **snapshot** of your business's financial health on a **single day**. It tells you what you **own** (Assets), what you **owe** (Liabilities), and what’s left over for you, the owner (Equity).

The Balance Sheet is governed by a fundamental equation that must *always* balance:

**The Balance Sheet Formula:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Let’s look at each part.

# 1. Assets

Assets are anything of value your business owns. They are typically listed in order of liquidity (how easily they can be converted to cash).

* **Current Assets (Can be converted to cash within a year):**
   * **Cash:** The money in your bank accounts.
   * **Accounts Receivable (A/R):** Money owed to you by customers for goods or services already delivered.
   * **Inventory:** The value of the products you have on hand to sell.
* **Non-Current Assets (Long-term assets not expected to be converted to cash within a year):**
   * **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):** Land, buildings, vehicles, machinery, computers.
   * **Intangible Assets:** Non-physical assets like patents, trademarks, or goodwill.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):**
   * Cash: $15,000
   * Inventory (beans, milk, cups): $3,000
   * Equipment (espresso machine, registers): $25,000
   * **Total Assets = $43,000**

# 2. Liabilities

Liabilities are what your business owes to others. Like assets, they are split into current and non-current.

* **Current Liabilities (Due within one year):**
   * **Accounts Payable (A/P):** Money you owe to your suppliers (e.g., your coffee bean vendor).
   * **Credit Card Debt:** Balances on your business credit cards.
   * **Short-Term Loans:** Portions of a loan due within the next year.
* **Non-Current Liabilities (Due in more than one year):**
   * **Long-Term Loans:** A business loan from a bank.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):**
   * Accounts Payable (to suppliers): $2,000
   * Long-Term Loan for equipment: $10,000
   * **Total Liabilities = $12,000**

# 3. Equity

Owner’s Equity (or Shareholders' Equity) is what’s left after you subtract your total liabilities from your total assets. It represents the owner’s stake in the company—the net worth of the business.

**Equity = Assets - Liabilities**

* **Example (Coffee Shop):**
   * $43,000 (Total Assets) - $12,000 (Total Liabilities) = **$31,000 (Equity)**

Now, let's check if it balances: $43,000 (Assets) = $12,000 (Liabilities) + $31,000 (Equity) -> **It balances!**

**Best Practice:** The Balance Sheet is crucial for understanding your company's financial stability. Lenders will look at your **debt-to-equity ratio** (Total Liabilities / Equity) to assess risk. A healthy balance sheet has a manageable level of debt and growing equity.

# Camera Angle 3: The Cash Flow Statement — Where Did Your Cash Go?

This is the statement that trips up many business owners, but it might be the most important of all. Profit does not equal cash. You can have a profitable business on your P&L but still go bankrupt because you ran out of cash.

The Cash Flow Statement (CFS) tracks the movement of **actual cash** in and out of your business over a period. It reconciles the Net Income from your P&L with the actual change in your cash balance on the Balance Sheet.

It’s broken down into three activities:

# 1. Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO)

This section shows the cash generated by your core business operations. It starts with Net Income and adjusts for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital.

* **Start with Net Income:** From your P&L.
* **Add back non-cash expenses:** The most common is **Depreciation**. You bought a $10,000 espresso machine (a cash outflow), but for accounting, you ""expense"" a portion of its value over several years on your P&L. Depreciation is an expense on the P&L, but you didn't actually write a check for it this month, so you add it back to get to your true cash flow.
* **Adjust for Changes in Working Capital:**
   * **Increase in Accounts Receivable:** If your A/R went up, it means you made sales but haven't collected the cash yet. So, you *subtract* this increase from net income.
   * **Increase in Inventory:** If you bought more inventory, cash went out the door. You *subtract* this increase.
   * **Increase in Accounts Payable:** If your A/P went up, it means you received goods from suppliers but haven't paid them yet, effectively conserving your cash. You *add* this increase.

# 2. Cash Flow from Investing Activities (CFI)

This tracks cash used for investments. The most common item here is **Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**—the purchase of long-term assets like equipment or vehicles. Buying assets uses cash (a negative flow), while selling them brings cash in (a positive flow).

* **Example (Coffee Shop):** If you bought a new $5,000 grinder, that would be a -$5,000 cash flow from investing.

# 3. Cash Flow from Financing Activities (CFF)

This section shows cash flow between the company and its owners and creditors.

* **Issuing Debt:** Taking out a loan brings cash in (positive).
* **Repaying Debt:** Making loan payments sends cash out (negative).
* **Owner Contributions:** An owner investing money is a positive cash flow.
* **Owner Draws/Dividends:** Paying yourself or shareholders is a negative cash flow.

**The Bottom Line:** The sum of these three sections equals the **Net Change in Cash** for the period. You add this to your beginning cash balance, and it should equal your ending cash balance on the Balance Sheet.

# The Magic: How They All Connect (The 3-Statement Model)

This is the core of the **financial modeling tutorial**. The statements aren't independent; they are intrinsically linked.

1. **Net Income Links the P&L to the Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet.**
   * **Net Income** from the P&L is the very first line item in the Cash Flow from Operating Activities section.
   * Net Income also flows into the **Retained Earnings** account on the Balance Sheet (under Equity). Retained Earnings is the cumulative profit of the business that hasn't been paid out to owners.
2. **Depreciation Links the P&L and Balance Sheet to the Cash Flow Statement.**
   * Depreciation is an expense on the **P&L**.
   * It's added back to Net Income on the **Cash Flow Statement** because it's a non-cash expense.
   * The cumulative depreciation reduces the value of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) on the **Balance Sheet**.
3. **Investing and Financing Activities Link to the Balance Sheet.**
   * The purchase of equipment (CapEx) from the **Cash Flow Statement** increases the PP&E account on the **Balance Sheet**.
   * Taking out a loan, shown on the **Cash Flow Statement**, increases the Debt liability on the **Balance Sheet**.
4. **The Ending Cash Balance Links the Cash Flow Statement and the Balance Sheet.**
   * The final number on your **Cash Flow Statement**—the ending cash balance—must match the cash balance listed under Current Assets on your **Balance Sheet**. This is the final check that ensures everything is integrated correctly.

# Putting It All Together: A Simple Example

Imagine your coffee shop's P&L shows **$4,000 in Net Income**.

* **Balance Sheet Impact:** Your Retained Earnings (Equity) on the Balance Sheet increases by $4,000.
* **Cash Flow Impact:** Your Cash Flow Statement starts with that $4,000 Net Income. Let's say you had $500 in depreciation and you bought a new $5,000 grinder (CapEx).
   * Your Cash from Operations would be $4,000 (Net Income) + $500 (Depreciation) = $4,500.
   * Your Cash from Investing would be -$5,000 (for the grinder).
   * Your **Net Change in Cash** for the period is $4,500 - $5,000 = -$500.
* **Final Check:** If you started the month with $15,500 in the bank, your ending cash balance would be $15,000. This **$15,000** is the number that must appear as the ""Cash"" line item on your end-of-month Balance Sheet.

See how they all talk to each other? This integrated view is what gives you true financial clarity.

# Your Action Plan: Making the 3-Statement Model Work for You

1. **Get Good Software:** Stop using spreadsheets. Tools like QuickBooks, Xero, or Wave are designed to generate these reports for you automatically from your bank transactions. This is the single best investment you can make in your **financial reporting basics**.
2. **Review Monthly, Not Annually:** Don't wait for tax time. Set a recurring calendar appointment to review your three statements every single month. Look for trends. Is your revenue growing? Are your expenses creeping up? Is your cash balance healthy?
3. **Calculate Key Ratios:** Go beyond the raw numbers. Calculate your profit margins, your debt-to-equity ratio, and your current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) to quickly assess profitability, risk, and liquidity.
4. **Forecast the Future:** Once you understand how the statements connect, you can start building a simple financial model to forecast the future. What happens if you increase your marketing spend by 10%? How would a new loan affect your cash flow? This is how you move from being a reactive owner to a strategic CEO.

The 3-statement model isn't just for Wall Street analysts. It’s a practical, powerful tool for every small business owner. By taking the time to understand the story your numbers are telling, you’re not just doing accounting—you're building a roadmap for a stronger, more profitable, and more sustainable business.

In my life I have ran across some really annoying and frustrating people who are always looking for that ‘angle’ or forever trying to perceive your intent and how you will cheat them. They, at times, deliberately try to trip you up or put words in your mouth that they have misconstrued because of their view of the world. Spending any time in the acquaintance of such people is exhausting and, if realized quickly enough, very short lived. The problem is, as they are cunning and always on the look-out for others to ‘mess-up,’ it takes a while for the non-treacherous to realize what is happening and are upset with themselves for not sussing it out sooner than they did. Well I tell you, don’t get upset or feel bad but be thrilled that you don’t have an ulterior motive or reason for being a normal, happy human! Justice will come eventually so stay on the right side of humanity!

Take these bees for instance. This is the time of year, in Ohio, when these little sweat-bees venture out en masse and swarm around legs, arms, coffee, water or anything else that may offer some sweet or salty condensation. They don’t bite or harm anything as far as I know; in fact there may be some good they offer without me even realizing it. They are just happy to be alive in that moment and glad to be around someone generous enough to not swish them away. I admit I used to be irritated and shooed them off only to see them coming back without a thought or care of what just happened. They carry on as they would have because they aren’t on the look-out for someone to sting, bite or irritate.

The saying goes, “fool me once it’s on you, fool me twice and its on me.” Well I’m not so certain. I had an occurrence a couple of weeks ago that took me off-guard even though I should have known otherwise. Afterwards I wasn’t as nearly frustrated with myself or the other party as much as I normally would have been. They are characteristically treacherous and I am characteristically not…and that’s all there is to it. I don’t understand them just as much as they don’t understand me. Do I wish they would change? You bet. Do I wish I could realize it sooner so I could offer a rebuttal instead of looking sideways like a dog waiting for someone to throw the ball? Of course. Will either of these things happen? Likely not. But I do know that if I’m like the bees and not here to hurt anyone but just be alive and enjoy what time I have, then I’m in good company becasue they obviously like coffee!

I’ve been working on moving on but it’s taking a toll on me.,"I’m (24M) watching the trailer for certified lover boy that drake dropped in October 2020 and the instrumental gave me an intense feeling of nostalgia for 2016-2020. Back then all I cared about was if a previous situationship wanted to get together and only seeked for her replies either on Snapchat or iMessage, overall her attention. She now most likely graduated from college 2 years ago and had a child. I remember only caring about when Travis Scott was dropping music, merch, or a collab with another brand, insta posts, and even getting braids just because i was a cringey fanboy lol. Im just yapping at this point, but like other young individuals i was careless, free and bold. But after 2020 it all went downhill. And I did this to myself. I simply didn’t lock in. I became too confident thinking that because I was so young  I had enough time to find myself and be someone in life .  But in the blink of an eye, 5 years have passed, I’m 24 now and I have done nothing with my life. My early 20s weren’t suppose to go the way they did. After going to college for 2019-2020 I took a gap year due to my fafsa being incorrectly filled out and denied aid and also I wasn’t sure what I wanted to major in or do  in life but I knew I wanted to be someone successful in life. Then between 2020 and 2023 after dealing with interpersonal issues and multiple attempts to return to college, I enrolled back to college for fall 2023-2024 still unsure what I wanted to major in. It wasn’t until I took an economics course and played coffee inc 2 during the spring semester that I realized that finance was my niche in the professional field. I then planned to continue college and then transfer to UIUC to complete my bachelors but I had to take another year off. So now fast forward to today I’m working a minimum wage and everyday I ask myself what am I doing with my life? What happened? Why didn’t I lock in earlier? This isn’t me? I feel so out of place and very off. 

Also me being a victim of FOMO doesn’t help at all, especially with social media recently showcasing posts of day in the life vlogs of interns going to their summer roles, or even graduates talking about their experiences after college. And iconic moments in concerts like at lollapalooza when Rocky performed I smoked away my brain and LVL and missing out on Coachella this year when they had a great lineup. I’ve just been missing out, staying in since I don’t have any income to fund my social life because I’ve been working low paying jobs and hating every single one of them.

Reality has been hitting me lately and it sucks. I wish I can go back to when I was a teenager or early 20s and experience more and make more friends, and actually think about my future and career. After 2020 every year till now has been a blur. Like I’ve been living in autopilot. I miss being young, I don’t even feel like I’m 24. Now everyday I feel a sense of urgency to change my life. And honestly I like that because it mirrors those emotions I’ve been feeling recently of feeling behind and  knowing I have potential but also I’m so overwhelmed that I don’t know what path to take or where to start. There is so many things I want to do but I get into this stage of limbo where I get overloaded with goals or ideas and I end up procrastinating and delaying Everything. However, I have been trying to make moves, I’m applying for college again and hope to start this spring 2026. ",1,1756176309.0,self,0,1.0,False

Dedicated Start

I had about **4-5 months of dedicated** study time at the beginning. During that period, I did my **first pass of UWorld**, finishing with about **50% correct**. i took notes of almost everything in the uworld notebook (incvluding tables algorithms diagrams etc).

At the end of that first run, I took my first two self-assessments and scored **220 (uwsa2) and 218 (nbme 9)**.this was like in june 2024.

# Life Happens

I got a 236 after working on weaknesses encountered on those self assessments mentioned above, around mid august 2024), but I had to **postpone my exam (was intrented to take on august 2024)** for personal reasons and ended up taking a six-month break. When I came back, I took **UWorld SA3** and got **226**. this was in january 2025.

# Resources I Used

* **uworld 2nd pass incorrects and marked:** after 1st pass i had about 2200 incorrects, ended up wiuth 600 incorrects.
* **CMS Forms:** About 2–3 per subject (except psychiatry since i felt i was good at it).
* **Ethics & QI (twice):** amboss high-yield ethics articles, patient safety, organ donation, challenging ethical scenarios, and quality improvement. i also did all of the questions from amboss related to these topics
* amboss 200 HY concepts (twice)
* **Divine Intervention Podcasts:** Focused on the high-yield list (see below), plus the “Get Your Head in the Game” episode on test day. look for the list of HY list of podcasts on reddit, its in a post somewhere.

# NBME & UW Assessments

* May: **NBME 11 – 246 (2 months out)**
* Then: **UWorld SA2 (2nd time) – 234 (around 1 month out)**
* 10 days later: **NBME 13 – 225** → this was a low point for me. I felt depressed and realized I had to **improve my testing skills**. (2 weeks out)

To work on that, I read several Reddit posts and watched a video on testing strategies (will link the ones I used):ok watch this video first: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_p4sFGHsUE&t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_p4sFGHsUE&t=4s)

then, read these posts:

After that:

* A week later: **NBME 12  – 240**
* 5 days later: **NBME 15 – 243**
* NBME 12 (, 7 days before the exam) – 240s
* free 120 new: about **80% correct**. (3 days out)

\*\*\*NOTE = after every NBME, i did a list in excel with the questions i got wrong and an explanation of why i got it wrong, classifying them (either not reading the question, weird distractors, i let mtyself go in a stupid detail instead of seeing the whole picture)... and i wrote down a solution for that issue next time i encounter a similar scenario (example issue: not reading well -- solution: read question twice and be careful with vitals). then, i reviewed and did uworld blocks on weaknesses encountered on every nbme, and i read my uworld notes of that topic too.

# Test Day Experience

On exam day, I listened to **Divine Intervention’s “Get Your Head in the Game”** podcast on the way to the center.

* The **first two blocks felt okay**, but by block 4 I was **exhausted and spacing out**. I had to literally close my eyes, count to three, and tell myself to focus.
* I took a **5-minute break after every block**, drank a lot of **coffee and Red Bull**, and I’m also on medication for attention deficit → so yes, I was in the bathroom every break.
* By the end, I walked out **devastated, crying, convinced I had failed**.

# Waiting for Results

The two weeks after the exam were brutal. I had so much **anxiety, couldn’t sleep or eat**, and kept spiraling thinking I failed.

When my result finally came in, I was **shocked and so relieved**.

That’s my story. I’ll drop the links to the testing skills Reddit posts and video that helped me, since those were a turning point.

If you’re struggling, please know that you’re not alone. Your NBMEs are not always the full story, and your actual exam experience can surprise you.

final thoughts:

\* i put in my task's list my weaknesses to study them, so then i dont forget to review those topics later.  
\* it helped me A LOT understanding that the exam and questions were about VIBES  
seriously, it givers you the vibe that its cancer, then stick to it, even if you dont have all of the reasons to say its cancer. i mean you have to trust your gut and stick to it  
(that was an example)  
\* i followed my gut a lot. like ""for some reason, this is what i think, im not 100% sure and the question is telling me some weird contradictory factoids. doesnt matter, if i think its THIS, then ITS THIS"". and you have to ignore a little bit your logical reasoning that leads you to the wrong answer.

1n0acus,https://i.redd.it/4q5bht1r0alf1.jpeg,Quick story about how drinking coffee saved my crawlspace from getting flooded.,"Saturday morning I got my coffee. And went to go drink it out on my back patio. It’s my favorite place to sit there and sip on my coffee. 
When I sat down, I noticed underneath this vent for my crawlspace that the concrete underneath it was wet. I went and checked the vent and it was even more wet than the concrete. I knew something was up. So I ran and popped the hatch for my crawlspace, jumped down with a flashlight, and started looking in that direction. A waterline had sprung a leak and was spraying water on the back wall of my foundation. A little bit had come through that vent.  I was able to turn off a valve just 2 feet away from the leak and isolated it completely and immediately. Spent a couple hours pumping out a little water that had puddled up. But all in all it was probably only 10 or 15 gallons. So I just wanted to bear my testimony that my morning coffee saved the day. In the name of bean juice, amen.

1n0a6zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualgensan/comments/1n0a6zs/for_the_youre_not_the_target_market_people_cope/,"For the ""you're not the target market"" people cope","If your complaints about a coffee shop are about fundamental aspects of what it is like not liking coffee, disliking caffeine, or expecting it to serve steak dinners then sure, you’re probably not the target audience. But saying the coffee is overpriced, the seating is uncomfortable, or the vibe is unwelcoming isn’t rejecting the genre. It’s giving valid feedback.

Most of the time, the criticism isn’t coming from people who “don’t get” coffee. It’s coming from actual coffee drinkers who visit cafes often and know what good coffee and service look like. When they say the prices are high, the portions are small, or the place feels pretentious, that’s valid feedback not confusion about the concept.

Saying “you’re not the target market” is just a way to avoid taking responsibility. It implies anyone who questions the experience just isn’t sophisticated enough, which feeds into this elitist mindset where it’s not about how good the coffee is, but whether you’re good enough for them.

Good products should be able to take feedback. Hiding behind exclusivity isn’t confidence. It’s insecurity.",18,1756175477.0,casualgensan,4,0.91,False

1n0a67q,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n0a67q/nf_secret_shopper/,[NF] Secret Shopper,"I am a secret shopper. Ive been doing this work for about 7 years now. The most I can say is it pays the bills. Is it my passion? Of course not. But sometimes passion has a way of finding you. Even in the most mundane parts of your life. Even.. as a secret shopper.
This story takes place on a regular day of a regular work week. Scoping the regular 14 isles at a time. Its a weird thing to do; this job. Im allowed- no, expected to act as i normally would as a costumer. I have more freedom than in most jobs. I can go on my phone, I can talk to people. I can dress casually. Yet, i cant help but put up.. a performance. Maybe it keeps the job interesting, idk. But most days I conjure up a new identity i want to take on for the shift. Sometimes I’ll go out of my way to introduce myself to strangers this way. A few times I put on an accent. Its rare that me and the other secret shoppers work shifts at the same time but whenever i get the chance I ask them if this is something they also do. Every single one of them agrees they cant help but perform on the job to some extent. Whether its a slightly more exaggerated version of themselves or who they wish they were. I guess its just the culture of this line of work.  But nobody seems to go as far as I do.
Today Im lingering between isle 12 and 13. These are the areas which people are often caught stealing the most. 
I fucking hate shoplifters. They urk me to my fucking core. Low lives. If it were up to me i’d walk right up to the sticky fingered fuck and grab them by the throat. Show them what its like to have something stolen from you for a change. But secret shoppers arent allowed to be hands on these days. I dont know, maybe im old school, but nothing gets done by running up to boss man and just “informing” him of a greasy sinner. Then the greedy iniquitous fuck just gets to walk out without consequence. I am basically a professional tattle-teller these days. But I understand its important work. But letting these delinquents believe they can continually get away with crime, they must believe they’re too good at it to get caught or even noticed. 
Oh but i notice. 
So of course.. I noticed her. In fact ive noticed her plenty of times. She a regular at this safeway. A strikingly beautiful young woman. Her sandy brown hair hangs at her waist and swings from side to side as she walks down the isles. Her makeup is bold. Theres always some use of glitter. Whether its on her eyelids, on her cheeks, or sometimes her lips. Her eyes are always surrounded with bright loud colors. On anyone else her style of makeup might appear incoherent, messy, and honestly unflattering. But with her her makeup choices didn’t register as strange. It suit her. Like her style, she was beautiful and strange. Like I said the day was regular. Like any other. But today was the first day that beautiful stranger, Emily, approached me. “You must really like peanut butter.” A giggly voice behind me says. 
“I always see you here and i swear you’re always looking at this shelf.” She laughs again. “Oh- uh yeah,” is all I can muster to say. Is she in on it? Have I been found out?
“I kinda drift through the same isles too, im indecisive y’know,” she sounds shy but still manages to be charming. My guard comes down. I can confirm her question weren’t accusations. My position isn’t compromised. I join her nervous giggles and we banter for a while. I gave her my fake name for the day, Ben. 
Looking back, I wish i could say that was the first and last time i spoke to Emily. But just like I feared, i couldn’t stay away. We’d continue to run into each other at the store, in those isles. We would laugh at the crazy repeated coincidence and it became our little running joke, “I’ll see you when i run out of milk”. Eventually we started seeing each other outside of the store. We met up to see each other at the movies, and the coffee shop down the street, and one time at the bar. And later that night, we met in her bedroom. After that i saw Emily almost every day. I practically lived in her apartment more than my own. I got to learn everything about Emily. Every wonderful, tragic, and alien thing about her. I learned everything inch of her body and oh boy.. did she learn mine. 
After 10 months of being with Emily she mentioned needing to run errands for the day. She suggested we go shopping together. I didnt think anything of it and tagged along. Then my gut sunk to the floor. She pulled into the safeway parking lot. I dont ever shop at safeway on my days off. It feels strangely foreign and critical of me. If im not the one watching then I must be the one being watched. As if you dressed up an actor in his stage makeup and costume and pushed him on in front of his expecting audience awaiting a show and said “Go ahead, just be yourself.” I feel deeply vulnerable and unprepared being here.
Also its just expensive af tbh.
As we walk in I notice Austin scoping the shelves of isle 8. Another secret shopper. We exchange nods. With a pristine swiftness, Emily grabs two cans of beer out the fridge and picks up her pace to a further isle. She never mentioned wanting to pick up beer. She doesnt even acknowledge what or why she just grabbed them. Theres this energy to her, this lack of acknowledgment, like if i asked her why she grabbed beer she would deny they were even in her hand. Her movements quick and routine. Ive seen this before. I just cant put my finger on where.
 “Here comes the meet cute zone!” She grabs my hand and leads me over to isle 13. The isle we first spoke. We pass the peanut butter (what I assume she wanted from this isle) and takes us to the far back corner. “stand right there,” she pretends to look at the shelves in front of her when *thunk.* It happens. She slips the two beers into her purse. Im at a lost for words. I can only stare at her with eyes wide in disbelief. She doesnt seem to notice and grabs my hand and leads us to another section. She smiles up at me, “ I got one for you too, babe. These are the perfect spots to sneak stuff, right? Something tells me thats why I always saw you waiting around here too.”  She nudges her shoulder against mine playfully and laughs.
 She… laughs. This woman- this beautiful wonderful woman ive come to love commits this despicable, heinous moral digression, makes me an accomplice…And she laughs. 
I pull my hand out of hers. I stumble a few steps back. I shared a bed with this woman, ive thought about marrying her, thought about having kids, I- I gave her the keys to my house! I cant hide the unadorned disgust on my face as I look down at her. Slight panic crosses her face, “What?! Oh my god my bad I just assumed-“ Before she can finish I straighten my demeanor, I look her in those beautiful big eyes and say plainly. “I guess you only ever deserved to know Ben.” 
Her face twists up in confusion. “Huh?? Ben, what are you talking about?? The hell do you mean by that??”
I didnt answer Emily’s question. I didnt answer her repeated questions as i walked out the store. I didnt answer her sobbed questions as i grabbed my belongings from her house. 
I didnt answer any of her calls.

Unfortunately, my life got back to its mundanity pretty quickly. Wake up, go to work, drive home, eat dinner, sleep, and repeat. Day in day out. 
I lost track of what day of the week it was. And sometimes what month we were in. It didn’t matter much. I just knew how many days in a row i worked and how many days I had off and that was all that was important. I cant tell you how many weeks and possibly months passed until i saw Emily for the last time. But it had been long enough that I couldn’t recognize the name she kept repeating behind me that has once belonged to me. Belonged to us. “Ben!” 
I had transferred to another safeway so it’s no surprise it took this long for her to run into me once again. Once I realized who this woman was calling out to i turned and faced her from the other end of the isle. We stood and stared. She stepped forward, teary eyed. She walked up to me and asked all the same questions I expected. She looked embarrassed and smaller than i remember her like she hadn’t been eating much. It was incredibly discomforting to see this person I loved desperately look so confused and pained at the sight of me. She sniffled and stuttered through her sentences, opening up about how difficult and disorienting this all has been for her. She says she’ll do anything to make it up to me. She opens her bag, “Look.” She sniffles and wipes her wet cheek and pulls out a $10 bill, “I’ll even pay for two beers here right now.” She gives a desperate small smile. I feel a cramping in my chest. I want to hold her and tell her i miss her. Tell her i love her more than life itself. But i swallow those painful feelings and look her in those round gorgeous eyes for the last time and tell her, “Im sorry ma’am I think you have the wrong person. Do you know where the tortillas are?”
Devastation breaks on her face, shes fully sobbing now, “But- Be- Ben whyyy??”
“Ma’am, my name is Issac.” 
I turned and walk away.
Away from the woman I loved.
To this day, 59 years later, I continue to work at this safeway as a shopper. Ever since then I never used the same disguise more than once. Is this job my passion? It just might have to be. I never married, never found love again. And still all these years later, I think of Emily.
She believed she loved me. She insist that she did. But you cannot love someone you never knew. Her love was poured into something that never existed. 
I may have made up the man she grew to love but so did she. She made up the version of me she thought i was. Filled in the gaps before i even saw they were there. She fell in love with me because she had already decided to do so before she knew me.
Before she even had a chance to decide if I was worth it. Before using her better judgement. 
This woman I loved was a stranger to me. And that thought terrifies me. But the fact i could still love her after the fact scares me much more than anything else could. 
I believed i learned this person inside and out, with an intense intimacy it was sometimes uncomfortable and at times disturbing. But the ways of her mind were and always would be a secret to me. The ways I am capable of loving and forgiving her will always remain a secret to her. The ways I hunt and expose the scum of the earth will always be a secret to them.

she’s never there when i need her for anything. 
she doesn’t put out ever because of a million reasons at a drop of dime. 
she’s never there for me emotionally when i ask her. 
i even say specifics of what i expect. 
she constantly goes out of her way to make me miserable and is just generally nasty towards me all the time. 
i’m pretty understanding and on long days i just can’t wait to have her around to decompress and undwind. but she always has a million excuses to be absent. 

example, i had absolutely zero sleep last night, but had to power through as i watch our kiddo while she worked the following day. 
i chugged a bunch of coffee and kept pushing through. i took the kiddo to the library, to the park, out for a walk. etc. played around the house. was nonstop all day long. which is whatever i love the kiddo. 
top it off wife had dentist appointment so i had kiddo from 6 am - 7 pm with 2 hours of light sleep. and i just asked her to come sit with me. made a big deal about it and got nasty with me saying she was “too tired to deal with me” i said i felt kinda emotionally abandoned and would like some companionship  that’s all. so she huffed and puffed and came in to the room i was in. only to complain about how exhausted she was from the party she had at work as a recreation therapist. (also states constantly her job is “awesome” and “super fun”) 
but whatever. she kept guilting me because i wanted her to hang out with me. so i said fine just go idk why i’m being treated like i’m a burden for wanting you but ok. 
so she just says again” i’m too tired for this im going to bed” and just left.  
found out minutes later she was just on the couch scrolling tiktok. 

i’m not trying to fill up the “nagging spouse “ role. but like what the actual frick. 

i am really losing sight of anything good in our marriage and i feel like it may be time to call it quits. 
i just have a hard time seeing anything useful or good coming from this marriage other than my daughter whom i love. but even then. wife is constantly undermining me or stressing me out soo much over non critical issues that it’s spilling over into my ability to be a patient loving father. idk what to do please does anyone have any advice? or have been through anything like this in their  marriage ? if so how did it conclude if still married ",0,1756175294.0,Marriage,4,0.5,False

1n0a36g,https://i.redd.it/b1z0qusfy9lf1.jpeg,Can i still date F(32),"My Autobiography: Re-Entering the Dating Space at 32
I’m Rachel, 32 years old, and if you’d told me a year ago I’d be stepping back into the dating world, I would’ve laughed it off. Life has a funny way of throwing curveballs, and here I am, navigating this exciting, sometimes nerve-wracking space again. My story isn’t about grand gestures or fairy-tale romances, at least not yet, but it’s mine, and it’s about rediscovering myself and opening my heart to new possibilities.
At 32, life looks different than I imagined when I was younger. I’ve been through my share of relationships that taught me what I want and what I definitely don’t. My career keeps me busy, and I’ve spent a lot of time focusing on others, which has shown me how much I can handle but also how much I’ve put my own needs aside. I’m ready to carve out space for myself again, especially when it comes to my heart.
Jumping back into dating feels like stepping into a new city without a map. I’m not the same Rachel I was in my 20s, swiping through apps with reckless abandon or saying yes to every coffee date. Back then, dating was a whirlwind, exciting but often overwhelming. I was still figuring out who I was, and I gave too much of myself trying to fit someone else’s idea of perfect. Now, at 32, I know myself better. I’m kinder to myself too. I love quiet mornings with a good book, I’m happiest creating something, and I need someone who can handle my sarcasm but also my soft side, the one that cries at dog rescue videos.
The dating apps are a jungle. I’ve swiped through profiles that make me laugh, like one guy whose bio just said, “I’m really good at losing at Uno,” and others that make me question humanity. But there’s something thrilling about it, the possibility of meeting someone who gets me. I’ve been texting with someone lately, and it’s been nice. They call me “gorgeous,” which makes me smile, and we’ve been talking about our days, building a connection that feels real.
I’m cautious, though. Balancing my busy life with dating is a lot. I’m up early for work, managing a hectic schedule, but I’m trying to make room for this too. I want to believe there’s someone out there who’ll understand my world, someone who’ll laugh with me over a glass of wine, who won’t mind that I’m a little frazzled from my demanding days, and who might even share in my creative moments.
I’m learning to embrace the uncertainty. Dating at 32 isn’t about rushing to find “the one” or proving something to myself. It’s about connection, finding joy in the little moments, like a flirty text that brightens my day or a conversation that feels effortless. I’m not looking for someone to complete me; I’m already whole. But I’m open to sharing my world with someone who adds to it, someone who sees the chaos of my life and still wants to stick around.
So here I am, Rachel, 32, stepping back into the dating space with a mix of nerves and hope. I’m juggling my busy life, and maybe, just maybe, flirting my way toward something new. Whatever happens, I’m ready to write this next chapter, one date, one laugh, one moment at a time.

1n0a2a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1n0a2a9/review_four_seasons_orlando_at_walt_disney_world/,Review: Four Seasons Orlando at Walt Disney World (August 2025),"**Where we went**: Four Seasons Orlando @ Walt Disney World

**When we went**: August 22-24

**Who went**: Me, wife and 22 month old son

Welcome back to part 4 of my North American city hotel reviews (If you missed the first 3, it was FS Houston, Salamander DC and FS Whistler). This time, its FS Orlando/Disney.....I think I can see a pattern here....

Once again, shoutout to /u/shermancchen, we booked their bog standard ""Four Seasons Room"" with no assigned view and when we checked in, we were given the Disney Park View room, which is a 3 tier upgrade and their highest standard room category before you hit the Speciality Suites. 

I guess dreams really do come true in Disney!

This is going to be a short review because of my overall thoughts of the hotel can basically be summed up to: **""Meets Expectations""**

It checks off all the boxes but it literally does not go a single inch more than that. Some Four Seasons are just jaw-droppingly amazing and others that are what the brand purports to be, but nothing more. Orlando is the latter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Location: A**

Its located in a private gated community called Golden Oaks. Its located in Disney but you also feel like you arent in Disney at the same time. Its located about 10-15 minute drive from EPCOT and Magic Kingdom so its not that bad.

The views from the room we got, the Park View room were spectacular. I unfortunately didnt get to see the fireworks because we stayed at EPCOT until after the show to watch it from the park itself.

**Rooms: A**

No complaints, but its just a standard hotel room. Honestly nothing to write home about. Bathroom had a shower and a tub, which for having a kid, is nice since hes too young to use a shower. Theres a small cut out area in the room for bag and closet space so the use the 500 sq very smart. 

Its everything you'd expect a FS room to be.

**Service: B-**

Again, its ok. Friendly, responsive on the FS chat and app and in person. Check In staff spent a lot of time going through their laundry list of amenities, explaining everything you need to know. They did what they are supposed to do.

They get dinged here though because when we arrived in our private car to the hotel to check in, around 11 PM, not a single bellman came to greet us, open or doors or get our bags. Our driver did all of that because there was just nobody around. I had to hunt down the bellman who was standing around in a corner not paying attention to people who were coming and going out the drive way.

I compare this to the experience I had at the FS Houston, a city hotel where we drove up at midnight to check in and we had 2 staff members waiting at the drive up, one who opened our doors, one who grabbed our bags and loaded the cart and took it to our room, all without prompting.

They get another big ding here because their housekeeping is sloppy/forgetful/inattentive. We were checking out on Sunday and we wanted to grab some waters for the road. My wife said she saw 4 bottles under the cabinet where the coffee machine was. So I open the cabinet and I grab the four bottles but to my shock, they are all half empty. I look at the FS branded bottles and they all have names and initials written on them, presumably from previous guests. The bottles were also neatly lined up, all facing the same direction so my only conclusion was that a housekeeping staff member probably rounded up the previous (or even before that) guests half used bottles and placed them in the cabinet. And then when the guests checked out, whoever else cleaned it, didnt check the cabinets to throw them out.

My wife is a huge germaphobe so she was disgusted and basically freaked out. Personally, I was ok with it because its probably an honest mistake but also at the same time, its a Four Seasons. Mistakes like this should not happen. Check the cabinets when you clean. Come on now...

**Food & Bev: A**

The only food we ate here was the breakfast and it was good, but again, not great. I'm sitting here trying to think of what I can say about the food and...I literally cant remember what I ate. It was all very forgettable. Not great but also not terrible. 

**Extras/activities/Amenities: A**

Look, this place is its own theme park. Its got a splash pad, lazy river, 3 pools, tennis courts, golf, kids club, spa, gym, multiple stores, multiple restaurants....I can keep going. 

The only demerit here is their shuttle to Disney. It only runs once an hour. For a resort this size and price, honestly that is inexcusable. Not only that, but there's no house car. This place should have a Disney shuttle that runs every 30 minutes and a house car on demand that can fill the gaps if a guest misses the shuttle. One bus an hour is frankly wild for a Disney resort. 

**Overall Review: Meets expectations**

Its a Four Seasons. In Disney.

Does Disney need an FS? Probably not if Im going to be honest. People go to Disney to go to Disney. We left our room at 9 and didnt return to the hotel until 11 PM. 

Would I recommend the FS Orlando to those going to a Disney theme park? Hell to the fucking no. Its value is nowhere to be seen if you are going to be spending 12+ hours outside of the FS. 

In my opinion, the only reason you should be dropping $1,200+ per night on FS Orlando is if you are never leaving the property. With all the amenities they have, you really dont need to.

If you do plan on leaving though, save your money and use it elsewhere. The Waldorf Astoria down the road is just a luxurious if you need a place to sleep while spending 12 hours or more at a Disney park. 

Theres simply no point in staying at the FS Orlando and spending all that money if you arent using its offerings. 

Thats not to say I wont return to the FS Orlando. I will, but the trip where we stay here, we will use every inch of the property and the property only. It wont be a Disney trip, it will be an FS Orlando trip.

Next time I go to Disney, I'm staying at the Waldorf and I recommend others do the same.",7,1756175108.0,FATTravel,1,0.9,False

So we got a new management team and they came and  decided to change rules that make zero sense. Here’s the highlight  of nonsense:

	1.	No sitting at the front desk. Apparently, it “doesn’t look professional” if a front desk agent sits. Okay, fine, but when the lobby is dead from 11 am til 2 pm or 8 pm til 11 pm and I’m standing there for 8 hours straight, my knees are crying.

	2.	No DNR (Do Not Rent) list… unless it’s about money. Did a guest scream in your face last week? Harass you? Make you cry in the back office? Doesn’t matter. As long as their card clears, we smile and hand over a room key.

	3.	No coffee for staff. Management decided it’s “too expensive” to let us drink hotel coffee. Apparently one sad little cup during a shift is gonna bankrupt the place.

4.  No control over ac. Before we could adjust the temperature but not anymore. Management says they want guests to feel “refreshed” when they come in from the heat outside. But guess who is freezing all the time now??

5. Prioritizing guest over everything even a basic logic. Example: a guest’s door had a small maintenance issue. And eventually it was fixed in 30 minutes, but my manager still wanted me to magically “switch them to another room.” Except… we were completely sold out. You can’t pull a hotel room out of thin air. I got yelled by GM at for not being “accommodating enough.


It might all sound like small stuff, but when you deal with it every day, it just makes you think hard about this job. I know they try to improve the guest experience but employees experience becomes worse. ",25,1756175045.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,23,1.0,False

 They may not be dazzling, but they are full of possibilities, guiding us to slow down, embrace the beauty of restraint, and find warmth and meaning in every moment.

1.	Magic Forest
Thick emerald and cobalt blue blend deep in the coniferous forest, like emeralds forged by dwarves in Norse mythology, with millennia-old frost clinging to their surface. This mysterious, profound green tone carries its own narrative tension, evoking the secrecy of the forest and the harmony of nature.

2.	Desert Sun
It merges the heat of scorching sand grains with a faint retro hue, as if slightly faded by time and intense heat. The mix of warm brown and rich orange calls to mind sunsets over sand dunes. In autumn and winter wardrobes, it will shine as a warm highlight.

3.	Lavender Blue
A hybrid of pre-dawn mist and newly blooming lavender in Provence, like violets bleached by moonlight.
It carries echoes of the passing summer, the chill of morning frost, and the soft glow of overcast winter days. This light, airy blue-purple tone brings a sense of tranquility and peace.

4.	Hot Chocolate
Imagine savoring rich red wine and delicious dark chocolate by a winter fireplace, where embers of unextinguished charcoal flicker. This alluring, thick brown tone with deep wine-red undertones evokes a velvety texture and warm comfort.

5.	Bronze Fog
A Western Zhou jue cup (ancient wine vessel) stands shrouded in morning mist, with bluish-green rust breathing on its bronze surface—imbued with the coziness of a cold morning. This is a classic autumn color: a noble metallic tone with a soft sheen, balancing warmth and refinement, and a worthy companion to coffee and green hues.",24,1756174966.0,RepladiesDesigner,5,1.0,False

2. Cats or dogs? (choose only 1)

4. Apple or Android? 

5. Music in the background or quiet environment ? 

6. Tea or coffee? 

7. Choose only 1 you can do for the rest of your life - reading books or watching movies/TV shows. 

8. Someone is kicking your seat in an airplane - do you keep quiet or do you say something?

Last week I got a call that made me fear the woods.,"I've been driving tow truck for Morrison's Auto Recovery for eight years now. Started on day shifts, but the night work pays better and there's less traffic to deal with. You get used to the weird hours, the drunk drivers who wrapped their cars around telephone poles, the breakdowns on dark stretches of highway where cell service cuts out. It's honest work, and I'm good at it.

Most calls are routine. Dead battery, flat tire, fender-bender where nobody got hurt. Once in a while you get something that sticks with you; like the time I pulled a sedan out of Miller's Creek with the driver still inside, or the guy who insisted his car had been ""moved"" while he was getting coffee at the truck stop. You learn to take people's stories with a grain of salt. Stress and fear make folks see things that aren't there.

But last Tuesday's call was different. I'm still trying to make sense of what happened out there on Route 47.

The dispatch came in around 2:30 AM. ""Vehicle off the road, mile marker 22, possibly occupied,"" Linda's voice crackled through the radio. ""Caller said the driver might still be inside but she couldn't get close enough to check.""

Mile marker 22 on Route 47 runs through some of the thickest forest in the county. It's a winding two-lane that connects the valley towns to the interstate, popular with truckers trying to avoid the weigh stations. During the day it's scenic enough, but at night it's just twenty miles of dark trees and no cell coverage.

I grabbed my coffee and headed out. Linda had given me the coordinates, so I knew roughly where to look, but finding a car that's actually ""off the road"" can mean anything from pulled onto the shoulder to wrapped around a tree fifty yards into the woods. I kept my speed reasonable and watched for reflectors or broken glass.

I found it about a quarter-mile past the marker. At first glance, it looked like the driver had just pulled off to take a call or get some sleep. The car—a blue Honda Accord, maybe five years old—was parked about thirty feet into the tree line on a patch of relatively flat ground. The engine was off but the headlights were still on, casting weak beams through the fog that had rolled in during the drive.

I pulled my truck up parallel to the road and hit the flashers. Standard procedure is to assess the situation before you start hooking anything up, so I grabbed my flashlight and walked over to see what I was dealing with.

That's when I noticed the first odd thing. The car's doors were all locked, windows rolled up tight, and I could see someone in the driver's seat. A young woman, maybe mid-twenties, gripping the steering wheel like her life depended on it. When my flashlight beam hit the windshield, she looked up at me with eyes that were wide with terror, makeup running.

I tapped on the driver's side window. ""Ma'am? I'm with Morrison's Towing. Are you hurt?""

She shook her head but didn't roll down the window. Instead, she pointed toward the woods behind her car and mouthed something I couldn't make out.

""Ma'am, I need you to open the window so we can talk,"" I called, raising my voice slightly.

This time she did roll it down, but just a crack. ""You need to get that car out of here,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Right now. Don't unhook anything, don't get out again. Just pull it back to the road.""

""What's wrong? Are you hurt? Do you need medical attention?""

""I'm not hurt."" She glanced toward the trees again. ""But there's something out there. Something big. It's been watching me for the past two hours.""

I'll admit, my first thought was drugs or alcohol. Wouldn't be the first time someone got spooked by shadows while under the influence. But she didn't smell like booze, and her speech was clear and coherent.

""What kind of something?"" I asked, playing along.

""I don't know. I never got a good look at it. But it's huge. Bigger than a person. And it's been circling the car, just staying back in the trees where I can't see it clearly.""

I played my flashlight beam into the woods behind her car. The fog made it hard to see more than twenty feet, but I didn't spot anything unusual. Just pine trees and underbrush, same as the rest of the forest along Route 47.

""Ma'am, I don't see anything back there. How about we get your car back on the road and I'll follow you to the nearest gas station? You can call someone from there.""

""No."" Her voice was firm. ""Don't go back there. Just hook up the car and pull it out. Please.""

Something in her tone made me pause. I've dealt with a lot of scared drivers over the years, and you learn to distinguish between different kinds of fear. Drunk fear is sloppy and unfocused. Accident fear is sharp but fades once the immediate danger passes.

This was something else—the kind of steady, controlled terror that comes from extended exposure to real danger.

I decided to humor her. ""Alright, ma'am. I'm going to hook up the car from here and pull you back to the road. Keep your doors locked and stay inside.""

Walking back to my truck, I found myself listening more carefully to the sounds around me. The forest was quiet. Unusually quiet. No owl calls, no rustle of small animals moving through the underbrush. Just the low hum of my truck's engine and the distant sound of a semi passing on the interstate miles away.

I was backing my truck into position when I noticed the smell. It was strong and musky, like a wet dog that had been rolling in something dead. The kind of smell that makes you breathe through your mouth. I'd encountered plenty of roadkill during my years of towing, but this was different. More intense, and somehow... fresher.

Getting out to attach the chains, I played my flashlight around the Honda and immediately understood why the woman was so terrified. On the roof of her car were two massive handprints pressed deep into the metal, not scratches or dents from debris, but actual palm and finger impressions where something had gripped the roof hard enough to deform it. Each handprint was easily twice the size of mine, with long finger marks that ended in what looked like claw scratches.

""Fuck,"" I muttered, running my flashlight along the car's perimeter. There were more marks—scratches along the passenger side like something had tested the strength of the windows, and gouges in the paint where claws had scraped across the metal.

""Now you see why I wouldn't get out,"" the woman called from inside the car, her voice muffled by the glass.

I was crouched down examining the damage when the first branch broke. Not a small twig snapping under the weight of a squirrel, but a substantial branch—the kind that takes real force to break. The sound came from somewhere deeper in the trees, maybe forty yards from where I was working.

I stood up and played my flashlight in that direction, but the beam only penetrated about twenty feet into the fog before getting swallowed up.

Then came another branch. Crack. This one closer, maybe thirty yards away.

Then another. Crack. From a different direction entirely.

""Sir?"" The woman's voice was tight with anxiety. ""It's doing that thing again.""

""What thing?""

""The knocking. It's been doing it all night. Breaking branches, hitting trees. Like it's trying to scare me.""

As if responding to her words, a loud THUMP echoed through the forest, the unmistakable sound of something heavy striking a tree trunk. Then another. Then another, from different locations around us, creating a pattern of impacts that seemed to be moving in a circle around our position.

I worked faster to attach the chains, trying to keep my movements efficient and quiet. The whole time I was acutely aware of being watched. You know that feeling when someone's staring at you from across a room? It was like that, but amplified. Like something with very focused attention was studying every move I made, and growing increasingly agitated by our presence.

As I was tightening the last chain, my flashlight flickered and went out.

I shook it, smacked it against my palm—nothing. The batteries had been fresh when I started my shift, but now it was completely dead. I had a backup light in the truck, but that meant walking twenty feet in the dark.

The branch knocking stopped. The forest went completely silent.

""Sir? What happened to your light?""

""Battery died. I'm going to get another one from the truck.""

""Don't leave the car. Please.""

The fear in her voice was palpable. And standing there in the darkness, surrounded by that oppressive silence and the lingering smell of wet animal, I found I didn't want to leave her either.

""I'll be right back. Just getting another flashlight.""

I walked to my truck as casually as I could manage, but every instinct I had was screaming at me to run. The fog seemed to have gotten thicker, and the Honda's headlights only created small pools of illumination that made the surrounding darkness feel deeper.

I grabbed my backup flashlight from the cab and was turning to head back when a sound froze me in place.

It started as a low rumble, almost subsonic, that I felt in my chest before I actually heard it. Then it rose into something between a roar and a howl—a guttural, primal sound that seemed to come from something with a throat structure unlike any animal I knew. The call lasted maybe five seconds, echoing through the trees and seeming to come from all directions at once.

When it ended, the silence that followed was somehow worse than the sound itself.

That's when the creature stepped into the Honda's headlight beams.

""Sir?"" The woman's voice was urgent now. ""We need to go. Right now.""

I didn't argue. I climbed into my truck, put it in gear, and started pulling the Honda back toward the road. The chains were taut, the car rolling smoothly behind me, when something massive crashed through the underbrush directly in front of us.

It stepped into the full glare of my headlights, and for one terrifying moment, I saw it clearly.

The creature was enormous, at least nine feet tall, maybe more. Its body was covered in thick, shaggy, dark hair that seemed to absorb the light rather than reflect it. The shoulders were impossibly broad, the arms so long they nearly reached its knees. Its hands ended in fingers that looked more like thick, clawed talons.

But the worst part was its face. It resembled that of a human, but with proportions that shouldn't exist on neither man nor beast. The eyes were deep-set and intelligent, reflecting my headlights with a yellow-green shine. When it opened its mouth, I could see teeth that were designed for tearing.

It stood there in the road for maybe three seconds, studying us with that terrifying intelligence. Then it began walking toward my truck.

""GO!"" the woman screamed from behind me. ""*GO GO GO*!""

I gunned the engine, hoping to scare it off, but the creature didn't flinch. Instead, it picked up speed, moving faster than anything that size should be able to move.

My truck lurched forward, the Honda's weight dragging behind me, but we were moving too slowly. The creature reached my driver's side door just as I managed to get us rolling. Through the window, I found myself looking up into its face from less than three feet away.

It placed one massive hand against my door, and I heard the metal groan under the pressure. The handprint it left behind completely covered the window—fingers easily twice the length of a human's, with what looked like thick, black claws at the tips.

For a moment, we were locked in this impossible stare-down. Me gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles had gone white, and this thing studying me with eyes that held far too much awareness. I could hear its breathing...deep, measured breaths that fogged the glass between us.

Then something seemed to shift in its expression, and it stepped back.

I didn't wait to see what it would do next. I floored the accelerator, pulling the Honda behind me as fast as the tow chains would allow. In my side mirror, I watched the creature grow smaller, but it didn't disappear into the forest. It just stood there in the middle of the road, watching us go.

We didn't stop until we reached the gas station eight miles down Route 47. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely put the truck in park. Behind me, I could hear the woman crying. Not hysterical sobs, but the quiet crying of someone who'd just survived something that shouldn't be survivable.

When I finally got out to unhook her car, I saw what the creature had left behind. There was a handprint pressed deep into the metal of my truck's door—not just on the surface, but actually deformed inward like the metal was soft clay. Each finger had left a distinct impression, complete with claw marks that had scratched through the paint down to bare steel.

The woman stood next to me, staring at the evidence of what we'd just encountered.

""Those weren't there before,"" she whispered.

""No,"" I agreed. ""They weren't.""

We stood there in the harsh fluorescent light of the gas station, both looking at proof that what we'd experienced was undeniably real. Physical evidence that something impossibly strong had touched our vehicles, had been close enough to kill us both if it had chosen to.

""What do you think it wanted?"" she asked.

I thought about those intelligent eyes, the way it had studied us both so carefully. ""I don't think it wanted to hurt us,"" I said finally. ""I think it was... curious.""

She nodded slowly. ""Like it was trying to figure out what we were.""

I called in sick for the rest of my shift and drove straight home. Spent the next hour sitting in my kitchen, drinking coffee and trying to make sense of what had happened. 

The rational part of my mind kept searching for explanations—maybe someone in an elaborate suit, maybe a circus animal that had escaped. But the handprints on my truck door told a different story. No person, no matter how large, could have compressed steel like that. And no known animal moved the way that creature had moved.

I still work the night shift. I still take calls along Route 47 when they come in. But now I carry extra flashlights, and I never work alone in areas where the trees grow thick and the fog rolls in heavy.

I had the handprints on my truck filled and painted over, but sometimes, late at night when I'm driving those dark stretches of highway, I run my fingers over the spot where they were and remember.

Because whatever's out there in those woods, it's still out there. And now I know it's curious about us.

That might be the most terrifying thing of all.",45,1756174607.0,nosleep,5,0.98,False
