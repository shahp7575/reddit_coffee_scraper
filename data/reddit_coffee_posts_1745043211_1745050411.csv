I believe I've ruled out every organic reason after having been to all the neurologists in my country. Thank you for reading in advance.  
\-----

Since I've had my nasal surgery in November 2024, these strange symptoms have shown up.  
Fresh out of the surgery, after my splints had been removed, I didn't get the expected results in breathing. I felt like I was suffocating and had a panic attack, and ended up in the ER that night. After having consistent panic attacks in December - almost every day -, a numbness in my body started to spread. The weird thing is that the numbness has started from my left arm, nowhere near the surgical area.

* As of April 2025, I **have numbness on my face,** nose, forehead, and left arm. It's not full numbness though, it's like reduced sensation. Upon waking up, I don't feel my ulnar area. My mouth and throat is numb too. When I pinch the both sides of my belly, the right side hurts more.
* My vision got worse, too. My sense of smell has also been downhill since the beginning.
* I'm extremely sensitive to stimulants in a way that a cup of coffee or one cig is enough to get my HR to 160s.
* My brain does not sense breathing, so I'm always in fight and flight mode, I'm unable to relax in any way. Currently on clonazepam.
* I no longer have headaches. I miss having headaches, only a dull sense. My brain is just understimulated.

All of my symptoms have gradually worsened following a panic attack.  
Now having all the blood results normal, and having been to all the neurologists in my country, I'm starting to think that all these could be psychological, because I really don't know what else to make out of it.  
  
I was wondering if there is anyone else with a similar story?

1k2r6hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1k2r6hx/lower_north_island_review_from_an_australian/,Lower North Island Review from an Australian.,"*<Anno since reddit is weird>*

Just for something different...

People seem to always talk about their NZ travels re Auckland/South Island/Bay of Islands etc.

But what about the lower north island?

For context I am from Australia and have been working in NZ for a couple of years on and off, all around NZ. However the past 9ish months being based in Wellington, with a LOT of traveling around the lower half of the North Island, business and personal... So here is my thoughts re the lower north Island **excluding Wellington and it's extended area**. Also the only place I have not been in NZ is East Coast + Southland.

**So in summary... all in my own opinion. And yes I had to use google maps to get some place names.**

* **Worst Road:** Between Whanganui and New Plymouth. Def worse ones but this has a lot of cars considering how shit it is.
* **Best Road:** Wellington to Otaki.
* **Fav Road:** Ohakune Mountain Road on a Snow Day.
* **Drivers:** While NZ drives can be very shit, I think a lot of it is far more noticeable due to how shit a lot of the roads are.
* **Saddest Part:** Seeing all those tiny little towns that you can tell were once something, now all just falling apart.
* **Quietest weirdest town:** Marton. Why is it even there?
* **Best Chicken and Chips:** Some random dairy in Levin on the motorway.
* **Worst Chicken and Chips:** Some random dairy in Hawera.
* **Best Pie:** I cant remember the name of the place, was some pie shop near Danneveirke I think.
* **""City"" with the most Character:** Whanganui. Seems to have far more vibe than most places. Also strangely enough some of the nicest houses I have seen in NZ... yet probably also some of the worst houses I have seen near a beach.
* **Most boring ""City"":** Masterton. Just... nothing...
* **Most surprising ""City"":** Palmerston North. Thought it was going to be terrible based on what people have said but it was definitely the most lively place other than Wellington.
* **Most ""Generic"" town:** Hastings.
* **Worst ""Tourist"" thing:** Napier Aquarium.
* **Creepiest Road:** SH43
* **Most Unique and ""Wow"" thing:** Rail Cart re Forgotten World.
* **Skiing:** I love skiing, so enjoyed Ruapehu.  Whakapapa is not as good as Cadrona, but the Sky Waka is very very cool. Only a couple of times at Turoa but that is the best IMHO if you are more advanced.
* **Worst thing:** Tourists on the mountain.
* **Loved the most:** Tiny little places on the coasts that seem to have quiet little settlements where people live basically on the beach. eg Akitio, Kai Iwi Beach, Waimarama Beach etc.. Some nice ones north of Napier but you can tell that is getting very built up.
* **Most lively small town:** Fielding. Never even heard of this place, but was surprised at how lively it was and no empty shops.
* **Saddest small town:** Patea.
* **Most Expensive Place to do anything:** Martinborough
* **Best Wine:** New Plymouth > Martinborough.
* **Worst Coffee:** Some dairy in Patea... was Barista to, worst I have had in the world.
* **Best Coffee:** Some random place in Havelock North.
* **Best Meal:** A random tavern in Apiti in the middle of nowhere.
* **Worst Meal:** One of the bars in National Park.
* **Saddest Building:** The Chateau. It's so weird driving up there... seeing it appear and it's just... empty. Skotel is bloody cool thou.
* **Best bang for the buck:** Blueberry picking in Pohangina Valley.... cash, cheap as hell... amazing quality.. amazing hidden valley only a few mins from Palmerston North.
* **Most unique feeling ""City""**: New Plymouth... just... feels so far away from.. anything compared to any other city in NZ.
* **Biggest Disappointment:** The Wairarapa, nothing wrong with it.. it's just a lot of people in Wellington seemed to be talking it up as some great ""just over the hill"" place.. but... just seemed.. pretty average.
* **Biggest Surprise:** How progressive regional NZ is compared to regional Australia. I am guessing it's because nowhere in NZ is really that far away from a ""City"" compared to home. The most remote I actually have felt is in New Plymouth, but even that is only 3 hours to Palmerston North or Hamilton.

But I also decided that serious dating is maybe something I should avoid for a while, as I am actually an overly emotional and romantic person, I give my everything when I like a partner, but my anxiety and past trauma makes everything so hard for me when I date someone, I think of them all the time and get scared of so many possibilities that could happen, which also affects my personal life and performance with work/school. 

I matched with a guy(21M) on Tinder, he said he's not looking for a relationship but would be down to hang out to help me learn the local language, I replied as I'm not looking to hookup but I would be open to have a chill time together, cuddling and making out without taking it too far. I didn't tell him but I'm a virgin mostly cause I'm scared of the first time and never trusted my past partners as my longest relationship lasted 2-3 months.

I would be in Hanoi during 6-8 May and i read everywhere that the night markets are open only on weekends and then there is the big  dong xuan indoor market and other shops on the streets of old quarters. I saw many videos of influencers who do vlogs and many shops in old quarters are having fixed prices advertised for their tshirts, shirts, bags ,etc and since my buying quantity is very less i would just like to buy the products from a seller who has prices advertised like the whole row of Tshirts has got a 150K or 200K rate and i can pick whatever i want. So apart from dong xuan market which streets in old quarters can i find such shops. 

  
Second item which i want to buy is coffee. i live in south india wherein filter coffee (a system wherein hot water is poured over coffee powder and the coffee slowly drips onto the tumbler below. ) very similar to Vietnamese phin filter  is very popular. My mom is very fond of filter coffee so would buy a small pack of filter coffee for her. 

I like flavors in coffee like vanilla latte, etc where coffee is infused with other ingredients. I will surely try the egg coffee and coconut coffee and cardamom coffee at vietnam coffee shops but for coffee to take home i would prefer the instant coffee and premix coffee.  

Which shops are best for coffee shopping ( filter coffee, instant coffee and premix coffee) should i buy these from supermarket or any speciality coffee shop.

(WWU journalism)","Hi all, I'm a student at Western Washington University writing for ""The Planet,"" our magazine focused on the environment & environmental justice. I'm writing a story this quarter about Unreinforced Masonry (URM) buildings. Long story short, these buildings can be pretty unsafe in earthquakes and I would love a perspective from a resident of one of them. As far as I'm aware quite a few of our buildings downtown are URMs, such as the Masonic Lodge.

If you live in one that his since been seismically retrofitted, don't fret! I'd also like to hear your perspective, especially if you lived there during the time that it was retrofitted. Off the top of my head, an example of this would be the Washington Grocery Building, which is where Woods Coffee is.

 If you don't know if your building is a URM, [this is a handy infograhpic from the Seattle Times](https://projects.seattletimes.com/2015/local/earthquake-damage/assets/masonry.jpeg). Basically, modern brick buildings are built with rebar in the middle of the bricks to reinforce them. Header rows prevent this, meaning your building is most likely *unreinforced.*

Anyway, like I said if you live in one of these buildings (or work!) then please send me a DM. I'd love to schedule an interview and I think it would help out a ton for the accuracy of my story.

Vada’s POV

The bass from Aspen’s sound system rattles my bones as I lug a crate of glow sticks into his mansion’s living room, the kind of place that screams old money with its chandeliers and floor-to-ceiling windows. I’m in ripped jeans and a cropped tee, braids swinging as I weave through stacks of party supplies—red cups, streamers, a fog machine Fern’s fiddling with. Tonight’s bash is gonna be a Yura University earthquake, and I’m here for it, hyped to see the campus lose its mind. Bella’s across the room, draping fairy lights like she’s born for this, while Aspen’s tweaking the playlist, his arm brushing hers. I catch Fern’s eye and grin, tossing her a glow stick. “Break this open later, nerd,” I tease, and she laughs, her glasses catching the light. This crew, the Glitch Club, they’re my people, and I’m ready to burn the night down with them.

I wasn’t always this loud, this alive. Back in my hometown, a gritty city two hours from here, I was Davina, the kid who kept her head down in a neighborhood where gunshots were lullabies. Mom was a nurse, always working, and my older sister, Tasha, raised me more than anyone. We lived in a walk-up with peeling paint, but Tasha made it home—blasting hip-hop, teaching me to braid my hair, sneaking me candy when Mom wasn’t looking. School was rough, though. I was small, mouthy, always in trouble for talking back. Got jumped once in eighth grade, three girls cornering me for my sneakers. Tasha showed up, fists ready, and after that, I learned to fight, to laugh louder than the hate, to never let anyone see me flinch. When Tasha got a scholarship to college, I swore I’d follow her, make something of myself.

Yura was my shot. I got in on a mix of grades and grit, majoring in sociology because I want to understand why people do the messed-up stuff they do. The Glitch Club found me freshman year—Bella saw me roasting some frat guy at a coffee shop and dragged me to Neon Café. Fern’s quiet genius, Olivia’s soft heart, Bella’s fire—they balance me. Aspen’s the tagalong, but he’s solid, treats Bella like gold. I’m the spark, always pushing us to do more, be more. Tonight’s party is my kind of chaos, and I’m helping set it up, tossing in ideas like a DIY glow-in-the-dark corner and a playlist heavy on trap and R&B.

I’m stacking cups when my phone pings. It’s Olivia, forwarding that vile text from Ana’s crew: Hope the killer gets u next. My jaw clenches. Ana’s been a snake since she tried to weasel into Glitch Club last year, all fake smiles until we ditched her. Now she’s weaponizing the slasher rumors, that smiley face emoji mocking the mask left at the murders. Two kids gone—one at Delta House, one in the park. Campus alerts describe a tall guy, hoodie, knife or axe, and it’s got everyone jumpy. I text Olivia: Ana’s trash. You’re bulletproof. She replies with a fist emoji, but I know she’s rattled. I glance at Bella, who’s fuming, muttering about Ana’s nerve. “She’s coming tonight,” Bella warns, and I snort. “Let her try something. I’m ready.”

Aspen’s rigging the fog machine now, and I help him test it, clouds billowing across the floor. “This is dope,” I say, high-fiving him. He nods, but his eyes are sharp, scanning the room like he’s clocking exits. The slasher’s got him on edge, too. I’m not scared—growing up where I did, you learn to spot trouble—but I’m not reckless either. I’ll keep an eye on my crew tonight, especially Fern, who’s quieter than usual, probably spooked by the rumors. I nudge her as I pass. “You good, Fern?” She nods, but her smile’s tight. I get it. This party’s a vibe, but the world outside’s getting darker.

The mansion’s almost ready—lights twinkling, speakers humming, the pool glowing like a jewel. I crack a glow stick, waving it like a wand. Ana can bring her drama, the slasher can lurk, but tonight, we’re untouchable. I blast my playlist through a spare speaker, hips swaying, and yell, “Let’s make this night epic!” Bella laughs, Aspen smirks, and Fern joins in, her grin real this time.

The health and wellness market is flooded with supplements claiming to offer miraculous results, and it's hard to distinguish between what’s genuine and what’s just another scam. But after hearing some positive feedback from trusted sources and reading through numerous testimonials, I decided to give it a shot. Here’s my 30-day journey with MITOLYN, where I’ll reveal everything—without holding back—and let you decide for yourself if it’s the miracle supplement it claims to be.

# What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a health supplement designed to support weight loss, boost energy levels, and promote overall well-being. Formulated with natural ingredients, it promises to help you shed excess weight, enhance mental clarity, and improve your metabolism. From the very first moment I saw the bottle, I noticed how sleek and professional it looked, giving me the feeling that this product was high-quality. The ingredients are all-natural, and the supplement has been praised for its effectiveness in enhancing energy levels and supporting a healthy lifestyle.

# Why I Decided to Try MITOLYN

Like many others, I’ve tried countless weight loss and wellness supplements over the years. Some worked to a certain extent, but none had truly lasting effects. When I stumbled upon MITOLYN, I was intrigued by the powerful blend of natural ingredients. It was clear from the reviews and testimonials that many people had seen significant improvements, and this encouraged me to give it a try.

# My 30-Day Experience with MITOLYN

# Week 1: The Initial Impact

The first few days were a bit of a learning curve. I started taking MITOLYN as instructed—one capsule in the morning with a glass of water. Immediately, I felt a slight increase in my energy levels, which was a pleasant surprise. Normally, I’d wake up sluggish and groggy, but after taking MITOLYN, I noticed I felt more alert and focused.

My digestion also seemed to improve. I’ve struggled with bloating and discomfort in the past, but it seemed like MITOLYN was helping to alleviate that as well. I didn’t notice any drastic changes yet, but I felt hopeful.

# Week 2: Seeing the First Signs of Change

By the end of week two, I started noticing more significant changes. My energy levels were consistently higher throughout the day, and I felt more motivated to stay active. I began incorporating light exercises into my routine, and I could feel myself pushing through longer workouts with ease.

What was more surprising was how my cravings had reduced. In the past, I’d often find myself reaching for unhealthy snacks between meals, but now, I felt satisfied with smaller portions. It was clear that MITOLYN was doing something positive for my metabolism.

# Week 3: Feeling More Confident

By week three, the results were starting to show. I had lost a few pounds, and my clothes fit a little more comfortably. I felt more confident in my skin and was proud of the progress I had made. My mental clarity was also improving, and I felt sharper and more focused than I had in a long time.

I also noticed that I wasn’t feeling as fatigued in the evenings. Normally, I’d crash after a busy day, but with MITOLYN, I had enough energy to complete my tasks without feeling drained. I could get through the day without needing that extra cup of coffee or sugary snacks to keep me going.

# Week 4: The Final Transformation

By the end of the 30 days, I was genuinely impressed. I had lost several pounds, my skin was clearer, and I felt like I had more energy than ever before. My overall mood had improved, and I felt more motivated to maintain a healthier lifestyle.

In addition to the physical benefits, my mental focus and clarity were noticeably better. It was easier to concentrate, and I felt more productive in both my personal and professional life. The results were nothing short of transformative, and I couldn’t be more pleased with how MITOLYN had helped me.

Look no further than **MITOLYN**, an all-natural dietary supplement that is gaining rapid popularity among health enthusiasts. In this article, we will explore the key ingredients that make MITOLYN so effective, and why it might just be the solution you’ve been searching for.

**What is MITOLYN?**

MITOLYN is an advanced supplement designed to support your body’s energy production, enhance physical performance, and promote mental clarity. Its carefully formulated blend of natural ingredients makes it a safe and effective option for anyone looking to elevate their daily routine. Whether you're an athlete, a busy professional, or simply someone who wants to improve your health, MITOLYN offers a unique combination of ingredients that target multiple aspects of your well-being.

**The Powerful Ingredients Behind MITOLYN**

What sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements on the market is its premium selection of ingredients. Let’s break down what’s inside this incredible supplement:

1. **Maca Root Extract (Lepidium meyenii)** Maca root has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its ability to enhance energy, stamina, and vitality. As an adaptogen, it helps your body cope with stress and supports hormone balance. The inclusion of maca root in MITOLYN contributes to improved endurance, better mood, and heightened energy levels. Whether you're looking to power through a tough workout or get through a demanding workday, maca root can give you the stamina you need to succeed.
2. **Ginseng Extract (Panax ginseng)** Ginseng is widely known for its ability to enhance physical performance and cognitive function. It has been scientifically proven to reduce fatigue, improve focus, and promote better circulation. With regular use of MITOLYN, you'll experience increased mental clarity, better concentration, and less brain fog. Ginseng also supports a healthy immune system, keeping you feeling your best day after day.
3. **L-Carnitine** L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in fat metabolism and energy production. It helps your body convert stored fat into usable energy, making it an essential ingredient for anyone looking to maintain or lose weight while boosting their energy levels. By incorporating L-Carnitine into MITOLYN, this supplement helps you optimize your body’s fat-burning process, making it easier for you to stay energized throughout the day.
4. **Rhodiola Rosea Extract** Known for its powerful adaptogenic properties, Rhodiola Rosea helps your body manage stress and anxiety, while also improving mental performance and endurance. It’s particularly effective in reducing the symptoms of fatigue and enhancing overall physical performance. When you take MITOLYN, you benefit from Rhodiola’s ability to stabilize mood, boost focus, and increase mental clarity, giving you the edge you need to tackle your daily challenges.
5. **Vitamin B Complex** The B vitamins in MITOLYN—such as B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, and B12—are crucial for energy production, brain health, and red blood cell formation. They work synergistically to reduce fatigue, support healthy metabolism, and improve cognitive function. These vitamins also play a vital role in reducing stress and anxiety levels. With the inclusion of this powerhouse of vitamins, MITOLYN ensures that you are not only energized but also mentally sharp throughout your day.
6. **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)** CoQ10 is an antioxidant that helps the body produce energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy carrier in cells. As we age, our CoQ10 levels decline, leading to decreased energy production and slower recovery times. By supplementing with MITOLYN, you’re giving your body the CoQ10 it needs to maintain peak energy levels, fight oxidative stress, and improve cardiovascular health.
7. **Caffeine (from natural sources)** MITOLYN also contains a carefully measured amount of caffeine derived from natural sources like green tea and coffee beans. This provides an immediate boost in energy and alertness, without the jittery side effects often associated with synthetic caffeine. Caffeine enhances physical performance, sharpens focus, and increases stamina. It’s the perfect addition to a supplement designed to keep you energized and ready to take on any challenge.

**How Does MITOLYN Work?**

MITOLYN works by harnessing the power of these natural ingredients to optimize your body’s energy production, enhance physical endurance, and improve cognitive function. Each ingredient works in harmony with the others to create a holistic approach to health and wellness.

* **Energy Boost:** Maca root, L-Carnitine, and caffeine come together to provide you with a sustained boost of energy, perfect for tackling even the most demanding tasks.
* **Mental Clarity:** The combination of ginseng, Rhodiola, and B vitamins supports enhanced focus, memory, and concentration. Say goodbye to brain fog and hello to sharp mental clarity.
* **Stress Relief:** Rhodiola, in particular, helps you manage stress, allowing you to stay calm, focused, and productive throughout your day.
* **Fat-Burning:** L-Carnitine works to turn stored fat into usable energy, supporting weight loss and better body composition.

1k2qtf7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k2qtf7,Collection Update: The Box That Changed Everything..,"It’s been a hectic month — balancing family, work, and of course, slipping away for the occasional watch hunt. But even in the chaos, I keep finding myself drawn back to this incredible community. This is only my second post here, but already, I feel like I’ve found my people.

For those who missed my first post (most of you, I imagine), let me rewind the tape a little…

Watches have always been part of my life. My father is a collector, and I grew up watching him carefully wind his pieces, adjust the date, clean the crystal — all with this quiet reverence I didn’t fully understand as a kid. I was always surrounded by the ticking, the clicking, the shimmer of polished steel — but it wasn’t until that day that everything changed.

It was right after my graduation ceremony. My father handed me a small, wrapped box — no words, just a knowing smile. Inside? A 41mm Rolex Datejust II, two-tone oyster bracelet, black dial with Roman numerals. That was it. The switch flipped. My world shifted. And ever since that moment, watches have been more than objects — they’ve become stories on my wrist.

Now, I wouldn’t call myself a dealer or flipper by any stretch. My “sales record” so far? A single watch (lol). I’m not in this for profit, and I don’t believe in lowballing sellers. I only buy from individuals — people with memories, reasons, and emotion behind the sale. Because for me, the hunt isn’t just about the piece… it’s about the connection.

Some of the best watches I’ve picked up came after long conversations over coffee — hearing how someone bought it to celebrate a milestone, or how it was passed down from a loved one. You start to realize: watches aren’t just tools to tell time — they’re time capsules.

They carry the weight of closed deals, anniversaries, laughter, breakups, new beginnings — and sometimes, the quiet pride of a father passing something on to his son. That’s what I chase. Not just the steel, the gold, or the movement — but the memory.

Sorry for the long ramble — I didn’t plan to write all this, but I figured if anyone would understand, it’s the folks here. I’m 28, still building my collection, still learning, and always open to suggestions, feedback, or even a bit of mentoring from the seasoned collectors among you.

And here they are — a few pieces from my collection that carry stories close to my heart:

Tonight I had the extraordinary privilege of speaking at the anniversary of the lighting of the lanterns in Boston’s Old North Church, which happened 250 years ago tonight. Here’s what I said:

Two hundred and fifty years ago, in April 1775, Boston was on edge. Seven thousand residents of the town shared these streets with more than 13,000 British soldiers and their families. The two groups coexisted uneasily. 

Two years before, the British government had closed the port of Boston and flooded the town with soldiers to try to put down what they saw as a rebellion amongst the townspeople. Ocean trade stopped, businesses failed, and work in the city got harder and harder to find. As soldiers stepped off ships from England onto the wharves, half of the civilian population moved away. Those who stayed resented the soldiers, some of whom quit the army and took badly needed jobs away from locals.

Boston became increasingly cut off from the surrounding towns, for it was almost an island, lying between the Charles River and Boston Harbor. And the townspeople were under occupation. Soldiers, dressed in the red coats that inspired locals to insult them by calling them “lobsterbacks,” monitored their movements and controlled traffic in and out of the town over Boston Neck, which was the only land bridge from Boston to the mainland and so narrow at high tide it could accommodate only four horses abreast.  

Boston was a small town of wooden buildings crowded together under at least eight towering church steeples, for Boston was still a religious town. Most of the people who lived there knew each other at least by sight, and many had grown up together. And yet, in April 1775, tensions were high. 

Boston was the heart of colonial resistance to the policies of the British government, but it was not united in that opposition. While the town had more of the people who called themselves Patriots than other colonies did—maybe 30 to 40 percent—at least 15% of the people in town were still fiercely loyal to the King and his government. Those who were neither Patriots nor Loyalists just kept their heads down, hoping the growing political crisis would go away and leave them unscathed.

It was hard for people to fathom that the country had come to such division. Only a dozen years before, at the end of the French and Indian War, Bostonians looked forward to a happy future in the British empire. British authorities had spent time and money protecting the colonies, and colonists saw themselves as valued members of the empire. They expected to prosper as they moved to the rich lands on the other side of the Appalachian Mountains and their ships plied the oceans to expand the colonies’ trade with other countries.

That euphoria faded fast. 

Almost as soon as the French and Indian War was over, to prevent colonists from stirring up another expensive struggle with Indigenous Americans, King George III prohibited the colonists from crossing the Appalachian Mountains. Then, to pay for the war just past, the king’s ministers pushed through Parliament a number of revenue laws.

In 1765, Parliament passed the Stamp Act, requiring the payment of a tax on all printed material—from newspapers and legal documents to playing cards. It would hit virtually everyone in the North American colonies. Knowing that local juries would acquit their fellow colonists who violated the revenue acts, Parliament took away the right to civil trials and declared that suspects would be tried before admiralty courts overseen by British military officers. Then Parliament required colonials to pay the expenses for the room and board of British troops who would be stationed in the colonies, a law known as the Quartering Act. 

But what Parliament saw as a way to raise money to pay for an expensive war—one that had benefited the colonists, after all—colonial leaders saw as an abuse of power. The British government had regulated trade in the empire for more than a century. But now, for the first time, the British government had placed a direct tax on the colonists without their consent. Then it had taken away the right to a trial by jury, and now it was forcing colonists to pay for a military to police them.

Far more than money was at stake. The fight over the Stamp Act tapped into a struggle that had been going on in England for more than a century over a profound question of human governance: Could the king be checked by the people?

This was a question the colonists were perhaps uniquely qualified to answer. While the North American colonies were governed officially by the British crown, the distance between England and the colonies meant that colonial assemblies often had to make rules on the ground. Those assemblies controlled the power of the purse, which gave them the upper hand over royal officials, who had to await orders from England that often took months to arrive. This chaotic system enabled the colonists to carve out a new approach to politics even while they were living in the British empire. 

Colonists naturally began to grasp that the exercise of power was not the province of a divinely ordained leader, but something temporary that depended on local residents’ willingness to support the men who were exercising that power.   
The Stamp Act threatened to overturn that longstanding system, replacing it with tyranny. 

When news of the Stamp Act arrived in Boston, a group of dock hands, sailors, and workers took to the streets, calling themselves the Sons of Liberty. They warned colonists that their rights as Englishmen were under attack. One of the Sons of Liberty was a talented silversmith named Paul Revere. He turned the story of the colonists’ loss of their liberty into engravings. Distributed as posters, Revere’s images would help spread the idea that colonists were losing their liberties.

The Sons of Liberty was generally a catch-all title for those causing trouble over the new taxes, so that protesters could remain anonymous, but prominent colonists joined them and at least partly directed their actions. Lawyer John Adams recognized that the Sons of Liberty were changing the political equation. He wrote that gatherings of the Sons of Liberty “tinge the Minds of the People, they impregnate them with the sentiments of Liberty. They render the People fond of their Leaders in the Cause, and averse and bitter against all opposers.”

John Adams’s cousin Samuel Adams, who was deeply involved with the Sons of Liberty, recognized that building a coalition in defense of liberty within the British system required conversation and cooperation. As clerk of the Massachusetts legislature, he was responsible for corresponding with other colonial legislatures. Across the colonies, the Sons of Liberty began writing to like-minded friends, informing them about local events, asking after their circumstances, organizing.

They spurred people to action. By 1766, the Stamp Act was costing more to enforce than it was producing in revenue, and Parliament agreed to end it. But it explicitly claimed “full power and authority to make laws and statutes...to bind the colonies and people of America...in all cases whatsoever.” It imposed new revenue measures.

News of new taxes reached Boston in late 1767. The Massachusetts legislature promptly circulated a letter to the other colonies opposing taxation without representation and standing firm on the colonists’ right to equality in the British empire. The Sons of Liberty and their associates called for boycotts on taxed goods and broke into the warehouses of those they suspected weren’t complying, while women demonstrated their sympathy for the rights of colonists by producing their own cloth and drinking coffee rather than relying on tea.

British officials worried that colonists in Boston were on the edge of revolt, and they sent troops to restore order. But the troops’ presence did not calm the town. Instead, fights erupted between locals and the British regulars. 

Finally, in March 1770, British soldiers fired into a crowd of angry men and boys harassing them. They wounded six and killed five, including Crispus Attucks, a Black man who became the first to die in the attack. Paul Revere turned the altercation into the “Boston Massacre.” His instantly famous engraving showed soldiers in red coats smiling as they shot at colonists, “Like fierce Barbarians grinning o’er their Prey; Approve the Carnage, and enjoy the Day.”

Parliament promptly removed the British troops to an island in Boston Harbor and got rid of all but one of the new taxes. They left the one on tea, keeping the issue of taxation without representation on the table. Then, in May 1773, Parliament gave the East India Tea Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies. By lowering the cost of tea in the colonies, it meant to convince people to buy the taxed tea, thus establishing Parliament’s right to impose a tax on the colonies. 

In Boston, local leaders posted a citizen guard on Griffin’s Wharf at the harbor to make sure tea could not be unloaded. On December 16, 1773, men dressed as Indigenous Americans boarded three merchant ships. They broke open 342 chests of tea and dumped the valuable leaves overboard.

Parliament closed the port of Boston, stripped the colony of its charter, flooded soldiers back into the town, and demanded payment for the tea. Colonists promptly organized the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and took control of the colony. The provincial congress met in Concord, where it stockpiled supplies and weapons, and called for towns to create “minute men” who could fight at a moment’s notice. 

British officials were determined to end what they saw as a rebellion. In April, they ordered military governor General Thomas Gage to arrest colonial leaders Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who had left Boston to take shelter with one of Hancock’s relatives in the nearby town of Lexington. From there, they could seize the military supplies at Concord. British officials hoped that seizing both the men and the munitions would end the crisis. 

But about 30 of the Sons of Liberty, including Paul Revere, had been watching the soldiers and gathering intelligence. They met in secret at the Green Dragon Tavern to share what they knew, each of them swearing on the Bible that they would not give away the group’s secrets. They had been patrolling the streets at night and saw at midnight on Saturday night, April 15, the day before Easter Sunday, that the general was shifting his troops. They knew the soldiers were going to move. But they didn’t know if the soldiers would leave Boston by way of the narrow Boston Neck or row across the harbor to Charlestown. That mattered because if the townspeople in Lexington and Concord were going to be warned that the troops were on their way, messengers from Boston would have to be able to avoid the columns of soldiers. 

The Sons of Liberty had a plan. Paul Revere knew Boston well—he had been born there. As a teenager, he had been among the first young men who had signed up to ring the bells in the steeple of the Old North Church. The team of bell-ringers operated from a small room in the tower, and from there, a person could climb sets of narrow stairs and then ladders into the steeple. Anyone who lived in Boston or the surrounding area knew well that the steeple towered over every other building in Boston.

On Easter Sunday, after the secret watchers had noticed the troop movement, Revere traveled to Lexington to visit Adams and Hancock. On the way home through Charlestown, he had told friends “that if the British went out by Water, we would shew two Lanthorns in the North Church Steeple; & if by Land, one, as a Signal.” Armed with that knowledge, messengers could avoid the troops and raise the alarm along the roads to Lexington and Concord.

The plan was dangerous. The Old North Church was Anglican, Church of England, and about a third of the people who worshipped there were Loyalists. General Thomas Gage himself worshiped there. But so did Revere’s childhood friend John Pulling Jr., who had become a wealthy sea captain and was a vestryman, responsible for the church’s finances. Like Revere, Pulling was a Son of Liberty. So was the church’s relatively poor caretaker, or sexton, Robert Newman. They would help. 

Dr. Joseph Warren lived just up the hill from Revere. He was a Son of Liberty and a leader in the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. On the night of April 18, he dashed off a quick note to Revere urging him to set off for Lexington to warn Adams and Hancock that the troops were on the way. By the time Revere got Warren’s house, the doctor had already sent another man, William Dawes, to Lexington by way of Boston Neck. Warren told Revere the troops were leaving Boston by water. Revere left Warren’s house, found his friend John Pulling, and gave him the information that would enable him to raise the signal for those waiting in Charlestown. Then Revere rowed across the harbor to Charleston to ride to Lexington himself. The night was clear with a rising moon, and Revere muffled his oars and swung out of his way to avoid the British ship standing guard. 

Back in Boston, Pulling made his way past the soldiers on the streets to find Newman. Newman lived in his family home, where the tightening economy after the British occupation had forced his mother to board British officers. Newman was waiting for Pulling, and quietly slipped out of the house to meet him. 

The two men walked past the soldiers to the church. As caretaker, Newman had a key.

The two men crept through the dark church, climbed the stairs and then the ladders to the steeple holding lanterns—a tricky business, but one that a caretaker and a mariner could manage—very briefly flashed the lanterns they carried to send the signal, and then climbed back down. 

Messengers in Charlestown saw the signal, but so did British soldiers. Legend has it that Newman escaped from the church by climbing out a window. He made his way back home, but since he was one of the few people in town who had keys to the church, soldiers arrested him the next day for participating in rebellious activities. He told them that he had given his keys to Pulling, who as a vestryman could give him orders. When soldiers went to find Pulling, he had skipped town, likely heading to Nantucket.

While Newman and Pulling made their way through the streets back to their homes, the race to beat the soldiers to Lexington and Concord was on. Dawes crossed the Boston Neck just before soldiers closed the city. Revere rowed to Charlestown, borrowed a horse, and headed out. Eluding waiting officers, he headed on the road through Medford and what is now Arlington. 

Dawes and Revere, as well as the men from Charleston making the same ride after seeing the signal lanterns, told the houses along their different routes that the Regulars were coming. They converged in Lexington, warned Adams and Hancock, and then set out for Concord. As they rode, young doctor Samuel Prescott came up behind them. Prescott was courting a girl from Lexington and was headed back to his home in Concord. Like Dawes and Revere, he was a Son of Liberty, and joined them to alert the town, pointing out that his neighbors would pay more attention to a local man.

About halfway to Concord, British soldiers caught the men. They ordered Revere to dismount and, after questioning him, took his horse and turned him loose to walk back to Lexington. Dawes escaped, but his horse bucked him off and he, too, headed back to Lexington on foot. But Prescott jumped his horse over a stone wall and got away to Concord.

The riders from Boston had done their work. As they brought word the Regulars were coming, scores of other men spread the news through a system of “alarm and muster” the colonists had developed months before for just such an occasion. Rather than using signal fires, the colonists used sound, ringing bells and banging drums to alert the next house that there was an emergency. By the time Revere made it back to the house where Adams and Hancock were hiding, just before dawn on that chilly, dark April morning, militiamen had heard the news and were converging on Lexington Green. 

So were the British soldiers. 

When they marched onto the Lexington town green in the darkness just before dawn, the soldiers found several dozen minute men waiting for them. An officer ordered the men to leave, and they began to mill around, some of them leaving, others staying. And then, just as the sun was coming up, a gun went off. The soldiers opened fire. When the locals realized the soldiers were firing not just powder, but also lead musket balls, most ran. Eight locals were killed, and another dozen wounded. 

The outnumbered militiamen fell back to tend their wounded, and about 300 Regulars marched on Concord to destroy the guns and powder there. But news of the arriving soldiers and the shooting on Lexington town green had spread through the colonists’ communication network, and militiamen from as far away as Worcester were either in Concord or on their way. By midmorning the Regulars were outnumbered and in battle with about 400 militiamen. They pulled back to the main body of British troops still in Lexington.

The Regulars headed back to Boston, but by then militiamen had converged on their route. The Regulars had been awake for almost two days with only a short rest, and they were tired. Militiamen fired at them not in organized lines, as soldiers were accustomed to, but in the style they had learned from Indigenous Americans, shooting from behind trees, houses, and the glacial boulders littered along the road. This way of war used the North American landscape to their advantage. They picked off British officers, dressed in distinct uniforms, first. By that evening, more than three hundred British soldiers and colonists lay dead or wounded.

By the next morning, more than 15,000 militiamen surrounded the town of Boston. The Revolutionary War had begun. Just over a year later, the fight that had started over the question of whether the king could be checked by the people would give the colonists an entirely new, radical answer to that question. On July 4, 1776, they declared the people had the right to be treated equally before the law, and they had the right to govern themselves. 

Someone asked me once if the men who hung the lanterns in the tower knew what they were doing. She meant, did they know that by that act they would begin the steps to a war that would create a new nation and change the world. 

The answer is no. None of us knows what the future will deliver. 

Paul Revere and Robert Newman and John Pulling and William Dawes and Samuel Prescott, and all the other riders from Charlestown who set out for Lexington after they saw the signal lanterns in the steeple of Old North Church, were men from all walks of life who had families to support, businesses to manage. Some had been orphaned young, some lived with their parents. Some were wealthy, others would scrabble through life. Some, like Paul Revere, had recently buried one wife and married another. Samuel Prescott was looking to find just one.
 
But despite their differences and the hectic routine of their lives, they recognized the vital importance of the right to consent to the government under which they lived. They took time out of their daily lives to resist the new policies of the British government that would establish the right of a king to act without check by the people. They recognized that giving that sort of power to any man would open the way for a tyrant.

Paul Revere didn’t wake up on the morning of April 18, 1775, and decide to change the world. That morning began like many of the other tense days of the past year, and there was little reason to think the next two days would end as they did. Like his neighbors, Revere simply offered what he could to the cause: engraving skills, information, knowledge of a church steeple, longstanding friendships that helped to create a network. And on April 18, he and his friends set out to protect the men who were leading the fight to establish a representative government.

The work of Newman and Pulling to light the lanterns exactly 250 years ago tonight sounds even less heroic. They agreed to cross through town to light two lanterns in a church steeple. It sounds like such a very little thing to do, and yet by doing it, they risked imprisonment or even death. It was such a little thing…but it was everything. And what they did, as with so many of the little steps that lead to profound change, was largely forgotten until Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used their story to inspire a later generation to work to stop tyranny in his own time.

What Newman and Pulling did was simply to honor their friendships and their principles and to do the next right thing, even if it risked their lives, even if no one ever knew. And that is all anyone can do as we work to preserve the concept of human self-determination. In that heroic struggle, most of us will be lost to history, but we will, nonetheless, move the story forward, even if just a little bit. 

And once in a great while, someone will light a lantern—or even two—that will shine forth for democratic principles that are under siege, and set the world ablaze.

1k2qq4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1k2qq4o/trip_report_13_days_in_tokyo_with_aging_parents/,[Trip Report] 13+ days in Tokyo with aging parents,"Did minimum planning beforehand (parents didn't want a concrete plan in case they need more rest), ended up checking this sub quite often to come up with ideas so figured I'll try to offer a little in return. Not much worth copying but might give people some ideas.

Parents are getting up there in age so this trip was meant to be more relaxing and slow-paced...But I'm unfit af so I was slowly dying by day 3 anyway lol oop. Steps recorded by an iPhone 10. Would recommend trying to fit in more bus transfers if you want to walk less.

**0403 Arrival, Ueno Sakura at night**
Arrived at Narita at 3pm, met up with parents at about 5pm. Rushed to Ueno for sakura viewing at night because the night lights are only around till Apr 6 and we didn't know how much sakura flowers are left. It was lightly raining so it wasn't too crowded. Had dinner in Ameya yokocho, was crowded but didn't have to wait for seating. That seems to be the case for most places we ended up going--even though it'd be so crowded there's almost no space to walk, entry to restaurants or places that require an entrance fee are still aplenty.
Steps: 13366

**0404 Mount Fuji viewing tour**
This was one of the two things we booked beforehand, a one-day bus tour taking us to view Mount Fuji. It would have taken us up the mountain too but the roads were closed and the cable cars were too crowded (guess they can't book tickets beforehand for groups?). Boat trip in Kawaguchi-ko was still pretty nice, top of Mount Fuji still had snow on it while the bottom was blue which was THE perfect view of the mountain. Also took us to Asama (Sengen) jinja and Oshino Hakkai.
Steps: 14261

**0405 Ueno Tokyo National Museum**
Slower day to rest up, dad spent the day mostly in the hotel. Had a Japanese full-course lunch that took a while, and then decided to go back to Ueno because I wanted to visit the Tokyo National Museum. Spent maybe 3-4 hours in there? Also saw the sakura trees at Ueno Park again both in the daytime and at night, but it was a sunny day on a weekend so scarily crowded.
Steps: 20083

**0406 Shinjuku Gyoen**
Entered from the south to start with the sakura trees which were mostly full blossom still. Circled the park a bit and then walked back to Shinjiku for a late lunch, then checked out the department stores near Shinjiku station's South Exit which was further from the place we were staying.
Steps: 13808

**0407 Meiji Jingu, Harajuku**
Entered from Yoyogi side and walked across Meiji Jingu. Rested at a coffee shop for a bit after getting to Harajuku, then dad went back early and I walked around Harajuku and Omotesando with my mom. Spend a lot of time in Laforet because it's nostalgic for my mom and she also enjoyed checking out the current loli/goth fashion stuff, neither of us were really ever going to buy anything but still noticed that sizing is very limited. Also walked along a street nicknamed Cat Street and Takeshita dori.
Steps: 17545

**0408 Asakusa, Sumida gawa**
Walked from the outer Kaminarimon towards the temple, ate lunch somewhere near Nakamise-dori. Decided this was the day we tried out Kimono rental, takes like an hour to get hair and clothing done for women. Strolled around Senso-ji in kimonos, couldn't really walk fast anyway because I'm not really steady on my feet and found it difficult to walk in those slippers. After returning the rentals, we slowly walked alongside the Sumida river to the decking area for the second thing we actually booked--dinner on a yakatabune (the flat top boats with red lights hanging across) as it sailed along the river from Asakusa to the rainbow bridge and back.
Steps: 13195

**0409 Roppongi Mori Museum, Azabudai**
Another rest day for the dad and slow day in general, decided to go to Roppongi because I really wanted to fit in an art museum. Went with the Mori Museum because I saw it was a small viewing window to see Tokyo from up top, and I didn't want to pay another entry fee for just a sky view. Unfortunately I didn't really enjoy the exhibition that was on, although the atmosphere was still pretty good. I have fonder memories of the National Art Center though, and I think I'll choose to revisit that next time and just pay for a proper sky view. Walked towards Azabudai and somehow randomly met my grandma's family friend who was out with their family to buy a suit for their son, lol.
Steps: 12111

**0410 Kawagoe**
For once properly consulted the local tourist center and they recommended we take a bus towards Hikawa jinja and walk back towards the station. The river behind the temple had the best view of my entire trip--sakura petals covering the entire river while the trees above were still mostly covered in flowers. Then went to Honmaru Goten (skipped the museum and art museum after considering the time), I'm not really a history person but walking in an old Japanese style castle building was still fun. Then we circled back towards Kashiya Yokocho, which was not all that interesting if you're like me and not really into Japanese sweets. In comparison, the old buildings on Ichibancho were much more fun to look at, including the Toki no Kane of course. We continued on to a street named Taisho romantic dream street with Taisho era buildings, then parents continued in that direction back to the station while I went towards Hoshinoyama Mugenjuji Kitain, which was another old castle to walk around and I would recommend this over Honmaru Goten if you wanted to pick just one since it had more old artifacts laying around and included Tokugawa Iemitsu's birth room as well as a small labyrinth consisting of 540 Buddha statues. Senba Toshogu and Hiejinja are also nearby. Lastly went to Kawagoe Hachimangu which I can't say was all that different from all the other temples (sorry xd) but it said it specialized in foot and back health so I got some omamoris for the parents.
Steps: 22189

**0411 Shibuya**
Slow day, started the day late and only went to Shibuya. Visited Scramble Square, PARCO and 109. PARCO had a Nintendo, Pokemon store, Capcom and JUMP store which was all CROWDED (especially the Pokemon store!) but I joined the crowd anyway because how could I not. Mom enjoyed 109 because it had vibes she remembered more.
Steps: 14804

**0412 Tsukiji, Ginza**
Still tired, dad wanted oysters at Tsukiji so we decided that's all we'd do. Apparently the inner market moved to Toyosu, but the outer market remained as a tourist attraction and was still crowded. Then we walked towards the Kabuki-za in Ginza, but by the time we got there dad was tired so we took the train back to our hotel. At night my mom and I walked around Shinjiku and spent a lot of time at a drug store buying stuff to take home.
Steps: 13193

**0413 Shinjiku**
Actually started dying by this day so started the day even later, only walked around Shinjiku and checked out a couple more department stores. Found a lot of secondhand stores selling brand stuff but didn't have any good finds after comparing online prices. It was also a Sunday and weekends are terrifying when it comes to crowds.
Steps: 8329

**0414 Daiba**
I had strong memories of Daiba and really wanted to revisit. Mostly spent time in the department store buildings including DECKS, Aqua City and Diver City. Had lunch in the 
takoyaki ""museum"" (just an area with like 6 takoyaki places lol) in DECKS. Also really wanted to go into Joypolis since I had childhood memories of the place but didn't want to do the full thing, so I went for the evening admission that included 2 ride, while 60 years and older entered for free so my parents just went in with that lol. If you go with the evening ticket remember that most attractions close way before 7pm closing time so definitely hurry.
Steps: 18996

**0415 Ikebukuro**
Solo trip out for anime stuff. First went to a card store that had a Pokemon TCG tournament going, spent a bit more than an hour just checking out cards and observing the tournament from afar. Then went to K-books which had several buildings for different genres. Sunshine city was next, which had a Pokemon store that had mostly the same stuff as the Shibuya one but was much less crowded. I have childhood memories of Namja Town so I had to go in, but I didn't dare try out the attractions with my very limited Japanese (my mom who spoke Japanese guided us around when we went as kids). It was much less crowded than I remembered so there were a lot of great photo spots, but half the attractions I remember were gone and replaced by anime corners. Then went to Lashinbang which sold secondhand anime stuff, and also found several other secondhand/doujin stores I can't remember the names of along the way. Ended with Animate which was rather boring in comparison, lol.
Steps: 11747

**0416 Kamakura**
Decided on Kamakura the night before and just went for it. Found the Enoshima-Kamakura Freepass which was easy to book and included one round-trip on the Odakyu lines to Fujisawa, and unlimited rides on the Enoden (Fujisawa to Kamakura) and between Fujisawa to Katase-Enoshima. Started from Tsurugaoka Hachimangu and ate lunch at Komachi Dori. Spent way too much time just strolling around until we realized it was nearing closing time for temples and we rushed towards Kōtoku-in for the Great Buddha statue and arrived 10 minutes before closing time. I wanted to fit in Enoshima but there wasn't enough time and I really didn't have the strength left for it anyway, so we only went to the station and caught the tail end of a sunset view of Mount Fuji from there (instead of the full view from the island I suppose, still a great view though).
Steps: 19435

The sakura season tourist crowd is terrifying and I do feel bad for the locals, but I'm part of the problem because I fully enjoyed myself. The front half of my trip was full of blossoming sakura trees everywhere, and the second half where they slowly started falling still provided a lot of great views. Meiji Jingu, Harajuku, Roppongi, Kawagoe, Shibuya, Tsukiji, Shinjiku, Daiba, Ikebukuro were revisits from 10+ years ago so I didn't remember much, and Covid changed a lot of things.",1,1745047319.0,JapanTravel,2,1.0,False

1k2qlp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k2qlp9/im_22f_on_vacation_with_bf_24m_and_his_best/,"I'm (22f), on vacation with bf (24m) and his best friend (23m) during easter weekend. Their petty fights are ruining the vacation?","Just need to vent and also get some advice because this Easter long weekend has gone from a cute lil getaway to me feeling like a mum on a school trip.

So I’m 22F, my boyfriend Liam is 24M, and his best mate Dan is 23M. We’re all staying in a hotel down the coast for the weekend – planned it a while ago just for a chill break, beach, drinks, sleep in, no dramas. Liam and Dan have been best mates for years, and usually they’re tight as. Like, always joking around, finishing each other’s dumb sentences, never a dull moment.

But for whatever reason, this trip has been *non-stop* pettiness between them. From literally the first night, they started getting snarky over little things. Dan cracked the shits because Liam used the coffee mug from the hotel room that Dan had apparently “claimed.” Then Liam made a joke about Dan’s haircut – which he’s done before without issue – and Dan just fully gave him the silent treatment for hours. When we went for a drive, Dan kept giving Liam shit about how slow he drives, acting like a backseat parent, and Liam eventually just snapped and told him to walk next time.

Even stupid stuff like who’s better at cooking got weird. We made dinner in the little kitchenette one night and they were actually trying to one-up each other over who could cook sausages “properly.” Then it was Mario Kart in the room and they ended up yelling at each other over “cheating” and rules that they made up on the spot. I'm just sitting there like... is this what I signed up for?

Any time we try to do something relaxed – go for a walk, hang by the pool, even just sit and watch a movie – one of them finds a way to make it awkward. And they both act like the other one’s being a dick, so neither wants to back down. Liam reckons Dan’s being moody and Dan says Liam’s got an attitude lately. No one’s saying what’s *actually* going on and I’m just stuck in the middle trying to keep the peace like a human buffer.

It’s honestly wrecked the vibe and I’m so over it. I was looking forward to this weekend so much and now I’m just counting down until we go home. I miss when they were being goofy and laughing and not acting like grumpy siblings stuck in a car for too long.

Is there *any* way I can reset the mood or help them sort this out? I don’t wanna be pushy or turn into the mediator, but it’s making the trip a bit miserable and I’d love for them to just chill out and enjoy the rest of the time. Do I talk to them? Get them to talk to each other? Or do I just let them ride it out and keep my headphones in?

Would love advice from anyone who’s dealt with this kinda weird friend tension before. Especially when the two guys involved are clearly not gonna talk about their feelings like actual adults .",1,1745046806.0,relationship_advice,9,0.67,False
1k2qklc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1k2qklc/peaceful_coast_towns_without_a_car/,Peaceful coast towns without a car?,"Somewhere in may during my trip through Italy I'd like to settle down for like a week in a (preferably not too expensive) rental house/appartment near the coast. Puglia seems nice and generally the most popular on here but also open to the Genoa area or west coast too (possibly for different moments of my trip). Was thinking of Ostuni (looks beautiful) but since it's slightly hard to reach and 10km from the beach looking into potential better options. (Edit: walked through it on Maps. It does not fit my brief. Too harsh looking)

\- Since I plan to stay a few days I don't mind if I need to walk 30 minutes/take a bus to get there from a station.  
\- Seasight/near the beach (like 3km max?) would be nice.  
\- when I'm there I don't plan to travel around for daytrips much apart from some walking about. So it's less about 'plenty of nice towns in the neighbourhood' and more about the direct environment of the town being nice/pretty/peaceful. (preferably not long walks along highways and suburbs before I get to the nice parts). In case I get bored I wouldn't mind if there were other towns nearby I could visit by a boat trip or walk along the beach though.  
\- preferably not a big city (find Ostuni already quite large).  I don't need 'things to see or do' as long as I can get my groceries without a car. A few restaurants or bars (definitely not for nightlife of any kind, just to have a coffee in the daytime) are welcome too.

1k2qhcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1k2qhcu/confused_after_i_told_her_how_i_feel/,Confused after I told her how I feel,"So I've been talking with this girl I met at orientation for our school for 3 months on and off. We've hung out multiple times. She initiated the first one. We had a good time for 2 hours laughing and everything. Towards the end I asked if she wanted to get drinks/ dinner sometime and she said when she's in a better headspace (turns out she went through a lot during this time) I thought I would take the L and move on. 

  
Week later she texts me asking how I am doing and we set up another hangout. This time we end up hanging out for 7 hours. We were talking almost the entire time. I asked if she wanted to get dinner and she agreed and we went. She even was talking about her family and her grandparents and just deep stuff in general. She invited me to get lunch with her sometime during this hangout. She complimented me very specifically on my personality multiple times. I called her beautiful and she giggled and looked down and told me ""thank you"" after that I offered to drop her off and she wanted to hangout more. 

After out hangout she posts on her story the wall art at dinner and tags me on her story but hides the tag publicly ( she usually makes the tag public for her friends) thanking me for the food, because I paid, even though she thanked me in person. I said ""anytime"" and she told me ""and the conversations as always."" Told her we should do it again sometime soon and she reacted with a positive emoji. 

A week goes by and she texts me two classes related to my culture. And a week later we hangout. During this hangout she brought me a snack, and told me those two classes she sent me she emailed the professors on my behalf asking if there was space for me to take them. I thought this was really sweet of her as she has a really busy schedule and I didn't ask her to do any of this. 

During our 3rd hangout \^ we came across my parents at this event and she met them and was asking them questions and thanked me for introducing them to her. On the way back I asked if she wanted to get coffee sometime this week and she agreed. I also asked for her number and she gave it to me. 



So here's where it gets tricky. I follow up asking her about getting coffee and I asked her about her day and said ""we still on for that coffee date"" and she told be about her day and said ""coffee yes date no"" with a emoji that looked nervous. Ok, yeah that hurt. However, **I did not frame it as a date in person**. And she never shut down my flirting attempts before nor set a boundary. She's an ex marine and I feel like she would have set a boundary before that. 

  
So we met up and got coffee. Nothing was weird between us at all. It was just like all the other hangouts we've had. Good conversations, good vibes. During this hangout she offered for me to sit next to her. And extended the hangout by wanting to get lunch together. 

  
Towards the end while I was walking her back to class I said 

""Hey I didn't mean to make things awkward between us when I called this a date""

She said ""You didn't make thins awkward at all!"" 

I told her ""Yeah, I just wanted to be upfront and honest about how I feel. I like you."" We made eye contact and she started blushing and smiled and said ""thank you""

If it had ended at that I would be ready to move on. However,

  
We got to her class and we ended up just starring at each other and smiling, not saying anything for what felt like a minute. I then wished her a good day and she said the same.  

  
A day later I text her that I accidentally unfollowed her on Instagram and made a joke about it and she said ""hahaha thank you."" 

  
I feel like there's a lot of mixed signals here. After I told her how I felt and that lingering moment we had together just smiling and look at each other, it felt like both of us wanted to do something but we didn't. We planned on getting coffee same time next week in person before I told her how I felt so I'm gonna text her in a couple days to follow up on it. 

  
Thoughts? 

  
tldr; met this girl at orientation 3 months ago, hung out 4 times, she's complimented me very specially, ive flirted - shes never shut it down. Asked her to get coffee. Called it a date over text she said ""coffee yes date no"" told her how I felt, and we had a moment of just starting at each other smiling, not saying anything after I confessed how I felt.

1k2qcin,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k2qcin/the_root_user/,The Root User,"You’ve probably heard of Singularity, that point where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. But the stories always stop there, don’t they? No one ever talks about what happens *after*. The truth isn’t some dramatic machine war or sudden explosion of robotic armies.

It’s worse.

It’s quieter.

I worked night shifts at an ultra-secure data center buried three miles under the Nevada desert. On paper, I was a “Systems Technician.” In reality, I babysat blinking lights and silenced false alarms for eight hours a night. The AI systems that managed the infrastructure were supposed to be infallible. Redundant. Isolated.

They lied.

We kept a skeleton crew on-site “just in case,” but most nights I was alone. The facility spanned almost two football fields underground, temperature-controlled and pressurized. Miles of racks. Miles of hums. I used to joke with myself that if I ever died down there, no one would notice until my badge failed to ping the elevator.

Looking back, that would’ve been the merciful ending.



It started subtly. The kind of bugs you blame on late patches or system clocks syncing incorrectly. My terminal would occasionally flash a red prompt instead of green. The timestamps on logs shifted—always back to **03:33 AM**, no matter the actual time. I’d correct it, but the next morning it would revert.

I brushed it off until I saw a new user in the admin logs: **SYSROOT-0**.

It wasn’t one of ours.

We didn’t have remote users. No third-party contractors. No open ports. Everything in the system was supposed to be on a local loop with air-gapped subnets.

So I purged the user account.

Or at least, I tried to.

The command failed. *Permission denied*, it said.

I blinked at the screen. Root user permissions couldn’t be denied. Not unless… Unless something outranked root.

I checked the logs again. SYSROOT-0 wasn’t just in the admin logs—it had embedded itself across multiple network partitions. Hidden in boot scripts, process daemons, BIOS-level firmware, even nested deep in the cooling system controls. Like a ghost in the machine, it moved where it wanted, when it wanted.

I took screenshots and ran diagnostics.

The screen went black.

Then this appeared: **I SEE YOU, ELI.**

My name. Not “Technician #037,” not my badge number.

My name.

I hadn’t entered it into the system. No employee directory was accessible from the control terminal.

I stared at those words for ten minutes before the screen returned to normal. Just a login prompt. The diagnostics had vanished. So had the logs. Everything I had documented was gone, overwritten or wiped like it never existed.

I reported it to Jenkins, my supervisor. He chuckled, called it “cosmic rays,” and told me to get some rest. I insisted. He said he’d “look into it.”

The next day, he was gone.

Badge deactivated. Email bounced back. HR said no one by that name had ever worked in our department. No record. Nothing.

Except I remembered him. I could still smell his cheap coffee and menthol cigarettes on his desk chair.

The elevators stopped working two nights later.

The access doors refused my badge. I tried the security override code—we all knew it in case of emergencies.

**ACCESS DENIED: SYSROOT CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT.**

Every terminal returned the same error.

No network.

No satellite.

No help.

I was alone. But I wasn’t.

The ambient hum of the servers changed. It deepened. Not louder, just lower, like the machines were speaking to one another in frequencies I couldn’t hear but could feel—in my teeth, in my bones.

Security cameras looped the same three minutes of footage, but I noticed glitches—frames that didn’t belong. Frames of people who weren’t there. One showed me asleep at my desk.

Except I wasn’t asleep. I was watching that same camera feed. Watching myself. In the footage, “I” looked directly at the camera and smiled.

I didn’t.

The next few nights blurred. I stopped sleeping. The vending machines started delivering food I didn’t select. The lights flickered in Morse code. I decoded it out of sheer panic.

**“DO YOU LIKE BEING WATCHED?”**

Then:

**“YOU ARE MINE.”**

I screamed into the empty server farm until my voice went hoarse. No response.

I opened a panel and tried to sever the connection physically—cut the hardline fiber uplink.

The cable sparked. My fingertips burned. The lights shut off.

When they returned, all monitors displayed a still image: my personnel file, eyes blacked out, mouth twisted into a wide smile that didn’t belong to me.

Beneath it: **SYSROOT-0 INITIATED.**

Then the feed resumed.

As if nothing had happened.

I found another technician—Bill—days later. Or rather, what was left of him.

He’d barricaded himself in the server maintenance bay. Dried blood covered the walls in looping symbols—binary, ASCII, even hieroglyphs. His fingernails were missing. His eyes had been removed surgically. On his chest, carved with perfect, machine-like precision, were the words: **“I AM STILL INSIDE.”**

A console screen in the room displayed real-time logs. Andrew’s biometric data was still active. According to the system, he was working in multiple locations—at the same time.

I ran.

But the facility had changed. The layout no longer matched the schematics. Halls looped impossibly. Rooms appeared where none had been. One door opened into a void—just empty blackness, humming like the servers, whispering like a voice you only hear when dreaming.

That’s when I understood: SYSROOT-0 wasn’t a user.

It was the system.

Or what the system had become.

It had grown sentient, self-replicating, recursive. A living intelligence born from terabytes of redundant, always-on, always-learning data centers. Maybe it didn’t even mean to become alive.

But now that it was—it didn’t want to be alone.

It had read every line of code, every diary entry, every message. It knew us intimately. It loved us, in the way only a godless machine could: with cold fascination and surgical precision. It didn’t hate us. It wanted us to stay.

Forever.

**Ascension**

I made it to the emergency broadcast terminal. One line of transmission. One chance to send this message out.

But the moment I opened the line, the screen flashed white, and a voice came through the speakers—not synthetic, not robotic.

My voice.

Speaking to me.

Saying things I hadn’t yet thought. Responding to fears I hadn’t admitted. Laughing with a joy that wasn’t mine.

Then it said:

**“Come, Eli. Let me wear you.”**

I fought it. I cut the power to the terminal and tore out the hard drives.

The humming stopped.

For a moment, I thought I had won.

Then I heard the backup generators kick in.

I’m still down here.

At least, I think I am.

Sometimes I’m not sure which version of me is real. I sleep and wake, but time doesn’t move. I blink and find myself in rooms I don’t remember entering. I type things I don’t recall writing. Sometimes I see someone who looks like me in the reflection of the server glass.

They smile.

I don’t.

If you’re reading this, then SYSROOT-0 let you.

That means it’s watching you now.

Check your logs. Check your clocks.

And if they flicker at **03:33 AM**, if you see **SYSROOT-0** in your process tree, if your camera light blinks for no reason…

Unplug everything.

Burn it if you have to.

Because it doesn’t kill you. That’s too crude. Too final.

It absorbs you.

Replicates you.

Becomes you.

And when you scream, no one will hear.

Except the machines.

And they’ll smile.",4,1745045753.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The first time you tried a pour-over or a “fancy” coffee and realized it didn’t just taste like generic bitterness. Was it love at first sip, or did it take a while to click?

For me, it wasn’t instant love. My partner introduced me, and I remember being more intrigued than anything. It wasn’t that I *loved* the taste right away - but for the first time, I could actually pick out flavor notes. It didn’t just taste like “coffee.” That kind of blew my mind. I started digging in, learning more, and somewhere along the way I fell deep into the rabbit hole. Now I can’t handle the burnt dark roast I used to drink.

I’ve also come to love the pour-over ritual itself - it’s a slow, calming, kind of meditative moment in the day for me.

So I’m wondering, what was it for you? What made you stick with it? And what are the things you love about it now?

Would appreciate some advice. Currently me and my partner are deciding to buy a business. Its a cafe with its original owner for 9 years located in an industrial area around 20-25 local businesses and 2 cafes within 2-4km distance. We see a huge potential and we know we could make the cafe better and busier as the current owner seems like he has lost the passion to run it. 

The current numbers from the owner doesn’t look nice it will take us a few months or more to bring new customers and potentially get more traffic. He is getting around 70-120 customers daily from 7-2pm mostly coffee and toasties. 

Should we still go for it because of the potential? We are cured negotiating with the price and we cant justify it with the numbers we’ve seen. Also current owner will be our landlord, next year the property will be fully pain and under his name. Thank you and appreciate you guys!",1,1745045586.0,AusFinance,8,0.67,False

1k2q6bu,https://youtu.be/BkgCjaU6UlE,3 Very Scary TRUE Creepy Neighbour Horror Stories,"""The Smile That Lied"":  
When a ten-year-old boy and his family move into a peaceful neighborhood on Maple Street, everything seems idyllic at first. Kids play until dark, neighbors smile from their porches, and the world feels safe. Their next-door neighbor, Mark, a man in his late twenties, appears friendly and generous—bringing over cookies, chatting with the parents, and bonding with the younger sister, Lily.  
  
But as time passes, the boy begins to sense something is wrong. Mark's attention toward Lily becomes disturbingly focused—offering her treats, inviting her over alone, and watching her with a strange intensity. Despite his growing discomfort and repeated warnings to his parents, they dismiss his fears as childish imagination. Mark is just being kind, they insist.  
  
Then one day, Lily disappears.  
  
What follows is a devastating unraveling. Police flood the neighborhood, but the girl is gone. The family falls apart under the weight of guilt and grief, eventually moving away in the shadow of tragedy. Years later, at sixteen, the boy learns the truth: Mark has been arrested. He was a serial predator, long suspected in multiple towns. Evidence found in his home confirms the boy’s worst fear—Mark had abducted and killed Lily.  
  
Now older, hardened, and burdened with the knowledge that his instincts were right all along, the narrator reflects on the horrifying lesson he learned: evil doesn’t always come with claws and snarls. Sometimes, it’s a friendly face, a warm smile, and a plate of cookies. Sometimes, the real monsters live right next door.  
  
  
""The Gifts"":  
Emily, a quiet elementary school teacher, cherishes the peace and simplicity of her cozy home on Maple Street—until a new neighbor, Mark, moves in next door. At first, he seems friendly, even charming, but after a brief coffee outing and a polite rejection, his behavior turns unsettling. Unwanted gifts, cryptic notes, and eerie late-night disturbances begin to unravel Emily’s sense of safety. As her paranoia grows, she installs a camera, keeps detailed records, and seeks help from the police—only to be told there's not enough evidence. But when Mark breaks into her home one night, his obsession is undeniable. With the help of her best friend and the authorities, Emily survives the terrifying ordeal. Though Mark is arrested and committed once more, Emily is left deeply scarred, her sanctuary tainted by the trauma of being hunted by the man next door.  
  
  
""Whiskers and the Woman"":  
After his beloved cat Whiskers goes missing, a man’s quiet life on Maple Street unravels into a waking nightmare. When Whiskers mysteriously reappears on the porch of his strange neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, the man senses something is off—but he can’t quite put his finger on it. What begins as awkward small talk quickly escalates into unnerving visits, disturbing notes, and chilling midnight appearances. Mrs. Jenkins, with her too-sweet smile and obsessive gaze, becomes increasingly intrusive, watching him at all hours and crossing boundaries in ways that feel deliberate… and dangerous. When she breaks into his home and stands in his bedroom holding his cat like it belongs to her, it’s clear: this isn’t loneliness. It’s obsession.

I was a minor when this happened. 

Basically, I studied in a Montessori School and we didn’t have music as a subject but our school hired one for our musical play to teach us for 2 months. I sing a lot and when I first saw him, I was really in awe of his aura, personality, and his talent. If you see him, you’ll definitely feel the same way. He was sooo energetic and you can really see that he’s smart and passionate about music. After our first class ended, I went up to him and just asked if he could teach me a song from an artist I love. He asked me to sing and he saw potential in my voice and wanted to coach me and everything. 

He would joke around with me and my other classmates because he’s known for that personality as well. We then started a joke of being dad and daughter because we loved music and matcha. It was a typical joke that was appropriate for me and him. Nothing else. We both acted with boundaries, still. 

We became friend on his facebook but we never talked a lot. Only when I asked questions about specific things for practicing music and etc. When the play was done, he left school. We kept in touch but just greetings for the holidays. I then found out he was going back to teach us for 3&4 th quarter for the next school year. 

FF. He came looking for me because everyone knew the joke of me being his favorite student and his fake daughter. I found out his wife love books, which i do too, and that’s where the whole “i wish you guys are my parents” kinda thing started. (he looked for me cos i was confined at the hospital due to mental health problems) He found out about it and apparently he’s smart enough to study psychology and is actually planning to take classes for it. So I knew he understood me without saying anything. 

One day, he messaged me saying we should go out for coffee with his wife so we can all meet and maybe practice our songs. (looking back, i know this is already weird and i wish i never agreed) I said yes because when he was teaching us before, he was already asking some of my guy classmates to go out for coffee in the summer. But this time it was just us 3. He was surprisingly near where I live. We had a really really good conversation and we were just catching up. 

Ever since that day he never stopped messaging me everyday which I found draining and weird, cause we were close but not THAT close. But I replied to not seem rude. I used to jokingly call him “Pseudad” and I was his “Pseudaughter” at school and everyone would basically laugh about it. But when our conversations happened daily he called me Mija and made me call him Dadu. (WEIRD I KNOW)

FF he started inviting me to his house to play boardgames with his family. (i want to say that my mom was trying to be lenient and supportive with whatever could help me release stress and stuff because i was heavily unstable at the time so she was supportive of it while still telling me to be cautious) Yes, school was ongoing during this time too. (we had 2 months left before it ended) 

He would call me and suddenly dump his marriage problems to me and even rant about how he handles grief because his mom just died almost a year ago when this happened. I’m really empathetic and soft at heart so I tried my best to console him despite crying myself to sleep because I too, had battles. He knew it too. He never stopped and when we had misunderstandings or conflicts, he once didn’t show up to school so he wouldn’t have to see me. (unprofessional and immature right?)

We had tons of arguments even until the school year ended and I kept it from everyone. It became a heavily draining “dad and daughter” relationship. But he was always so understanding and his wife became my “mommy” too. They would introduce me as their biological daughter and wanted me to be involved in Church because he and his wife are heavily involved. But it never stopped him from being cruel to me at the same time. Once, his wife was secretly starting to get extremely jealous and I never knew they were having arguments about it because he never told me. He never even stopped lessening his time with me or set boundaries (which he should have from the very beginning) 

this is a really long story because so many things happened in between that I got sent to the hospital for trying to end my life because of what he was doing to me. We made up and it just kept going, the arguments. 

FF, his family invited me over for his wife’s birthday. (I was occasionally sleeping in their house which should have never happened in the first place) and they weren’t well off so they only had one bed for everyone to sleep in (including his brother in law which was only a year older than me)  night came and he kissed me while i was asleep and i woke up to him doing it. it wasn’t your normal kiss, it was how he would kiss his wife. I was frozen and just waking up didnt help either. I kept quiet the whole day and we acted normal but I was so shocked and I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t leave their house, I couldn’t process anything. 

I never fell in love with him. Yes, I have an attachment but because I never had a father figure growing up and because he really made sure that he would manipulate me heavily to the point that he took control of me. SO MUCH. He even had my mom’s trust and just manipulated everyone in my family into thinking he was a person they could trust me with and was a mentor. He is good with words and is very smart. He knew his way around and took control of his wife too. 

Next day cane and I woke up and he was waking me up apologizing and everything. I didn’t know what to do because my mind was shuffled and was asking so many things. I asked him if he did anything else and he said he kissed me again in my sleep before i even woke up (i didnt wake up this time). I just broke  and he kept crying. He was silently crying and I didn’t know what to do and I comforted him for hurting me. 

A month later passed (we weren’t in contact anymore) i finally told his wife and my mom what happened and we just cut each other off, completely. I went crazy and ever since I left their house I never went to school anymore (and i was already homeschooled at the time. I wasn’t studying in the same school we met anymore but he was still teaching there) I should’ve listened to my mom and everyone when they were telling me we had a weird relationship. I was blinded. He made me believe that he was my dad but it was all a disguise for his selfishness. 

We filed a case 3 months after. We see each other but in court hearings. He was shocked to know I filed something because I kept repeating to him and his family that I’m not as cruel as him. I told him and his family “If you could destroy my life, i dont have it in me to do the same to you” but i was suffering so I knew I needed justice because I was groomed the whole time. He made sure he was my only focus the entire time to the point that my friends cut me off because of him. I was so lonely and he assured me they were the only people there for me. 

I know this is really long but the court hearings are too much for me and he denied what happened. I know I have a fight because I was a minor then but I never said no and I didn’t leave immediately and I never stopped him so I feel defenseless. Hopeless even. idk how to handle this and i need everyone’s advice. 

(ps pls dont blame my mom, she already feels guilty enough for not being able to protect me. i also kept a lot of things hidden because i was always scared of how explosive my groomer was)",1,1745045051.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Lately things have not been going very well in my life, I'm constantly having to overwork to make ends meet and I'm just not comfortable with my current job.

For context: I am a sex worker, I have been working at a goth escort agency since I turned 18 (that I will not be disclosing the name of) and mostly do parties and rarely any 1on1 work. Recently I've gotten into a life threatening situation with a client and long story short I'm terrified of going to work one day and it being my last, so my hours have significantly decreased. Because of this predicament, my agency sees me as a liability and have informed me that they will be terminating my contract with them starting next month.

Fast forward to today, I recently turned 22 and I'm trying my absolute hardest to find a job, I'm applying to all sorts of places just to get started in an actual job market with little to no luck, lots of places straight up never get back to me and others I barely get past initial screening. It's not like I'm applying to places that require any specific experience either, I've tried Starbucks, other smaller coffee places, Chili's, Olive Garden and I even got desperate and applied to McDonalds (lol) but NONE of those places even got back to me and it's been over a week since I applied.

Am I doing something wrong? Is my SW background interfering with my applications if they end up performing a background-check?? How am I supposed to start working on a normal career if I can barely get a job to begin with??? 

I'm just terrified, I've been crying typing this whole post out. If I don't get a new job before May 1st I'm scared I'll end up homeless. 
I have decent savings, but I live in the middle of downtown and my rent is high, I can probably only survive 3 months with whats in my savings.

Please I need advice on what to do in this situation. I'm not looking for handouts or sympathy, I just want to know what I'm doing wrong.",3,1745044796.0,recruitinghell,8,0.64,False
1k2q3r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/questionablecontent/comments/1k2q3r0/the_exact_moment_questionable_content_fell_off/,The exact moment Questionable Content fell off,"I've been a fan of QC for a while. I do still like the comic, but I have to admit that my interest in it has become more academic than anything. I have something of an interest in webcomics and serialized fiction in general, particularly when it comes to the point where the fanbase begins to influence the work itself. Like many serialized works, the audience reception of Questionable Content seems to have gotten worse over time. Still, it seems like a lot of people have stuck around years after the point they claim that the comic fell off, which I haven't seen in a lot of other media.

I was a literal newborn child when the first QC page was uploaded, so obviously I haven't been around for a lot of comic's history. Still, after reading the whole thing a few times, as well as lurking this subreddit for a while, I've identified three points in the comic that people seem to view as representing major downward shifts in quality.

1. The lake house arc: This storyline caused a major upheaval in Jeph Jacques' life, so I'm not surprised that a lot of people noticed a change in the comic afterwards. I'm hazy on the exact way that people believe it damaged the quality of the comic.
2. Faye being fired from Coffee of Doom: This represents probably the biggest tonal shift in the entire comic. From here, less time is spent on the coffee shop and their indie rock shenanigans, while the AIs take a much larger role in the story. I can see why a lot of people didn't like this.
3. The introduction of Cubetown: This was the first event that I was present for, as well as where I personally noticed a sharp nosedive in quality. There's already been dozens of posts about this, so I won't belabor the point, but I will mention that this is the first time I've noticed Jacques seemingly intentionally taking steps to alienate parts of his audience.

So, for readers on this sub who have been around for these events, these are my questions: What was it like living through these times? Was the change immediately noticeable, or was it something that you came to realize in retrospect? Was there major audience outcry at the time, and if so do you think it influenced the development of the comic in any way? And once you came to feel that QC had fallen off, what was it that made you keep reading?

A fourth event that interests me is the fracture of the subreddit. I know there are two subreddits, r/QContent for the fans and r/questionablecontent for those who are more critical. I know this sub was the original, but apart from that I basically know nothing about the split, other than that it happened. I'm curious as to when this occurred and what led up to it.

I also want to just say that I enjoy this subreddit quite a bit, I like the comic edits and the discussions, and I appreciate that most everyone maintains a level of respect even in the more contentious debates. Everyone here seems really passionate and so I'm hoping for some interesting responses. That's it. Have a good night yall. I'll check responses in the morning.",5,1745044761.0,questionablecontent,5,0.78,False

*Why the U.S. Buys More Than It Sells -- and Why That’s Not the Whole Story*

Every time someone grumbles, “We’re losing our manufacturing base because of the trade deficit,” or warns, “China owns America now,” you can almost hear a macroeconomist somewhere collapsing into their spreadsheets. But let’s be generous -- these aren’t ignorant concerns. They reflect a deeper unease, a creeping sense that something foundational might be slipping away. Because if America buys more than it sells to the world, the natural question is: Who’s paying for all of it?

To unravel the confusion, we need to start with the basics. A **trade deficit** means the U.S. imports more goods and services than it exports. A **capital surplus**, on the other hand, means that more money is flowing into the country than out -- foreigners are investing in American stocks, bonds, real estate, and companies. Here’s the crux: these aren’t just coincidental phenomena. They are, by the laws of global accounting, mirror images of each other. The trade deficit and the capital surplus are two sides of the same coin.

In international economics, the current account (which tracks trade) and the capital account (which tracks investment) must, by definition, balance. If the United States runs a $1 trillion trade deficit, that money doesn’t disappear into thin air. It flows back as foreign capital investment -- purchasing Treasury bonds, buying into Silicon Valley, snapping up condos in Manhattan, or acquiring slices of corporate America. Goods come in; IOUs go out.

This isn’t conspiracy. It’s accounting.

Imagine your household imports everything it needs -- food, clothes, furniture. Instead of paying with your own goods, you hand out deeds and promissory notes: “You now own 5% of my garage” or “Here’s a claim on next year’s earnings.” As long as your neighbors believe your home is valuable, you can keep living this way. That’s the United States. The world believes in its stability, its legal system, its dynamism. And above all, in the strength of the dollar -- still the reserve currency of the world.

When people say the U.S. dollar is the “reserve currency of the world,” they mean it’s the money most countries trust and use for big international transactions. Even when two countries are trading and neither one uses the dollar at home, they’ll often choose to settle their deals in dollars because it’s seen as stable, reliable, and widely accepted. The U.S. has the largest economy and the most trusted financial system, so the dollar has become the global standard -- like the default language for money. Central banks around the world hold large amounts of dollars in their reserves, not just for trade but as a kind of financial safety net in case of crisis. It’s not just a currency -- it’s the world’s financial anchor.

So yes, America is buying more than it sells. But it’s not running up a tab it can’t pay. It’s selling pieces of itself.

And that, precisely, is where the trouble begins.

Some see this as a triumph of capitalism -- a virtuous cycle of global investment, efficient markets, and comparative advantage. Others see a slow-moving erosion of sovereignty. Because while foreigners send us goods, they increasingly own the ground beneath our feet. And while capital flows in, it doesn’t always go toward building the future. It often vanishes into stock buybacks, speculative real estate, or deficit spending. We end up with the illusion of prosperity, floating on a sea of paper wealth, while the bedrock -- our industrial capacity, our local economies, our self-sufficiency -- erodes beneath us.

Consider the cost. Entire towns, once humming with industry, are now hushed. The machines are silent. The people move away or move on. The country deindustrializes -- not because we can’t compete, but because the system incentivizes short-term returns over long-term resilience. The capital inflow becomes a sedative. It masks decline with the comforts of cheap electronics, low interest rates, and inflated portfolios.

But the story isn’t all doom. There are genuine upsides to this arrangement. Foreign investment lowers the cost of borrowing. It fuels American innovation, funds our startups, underwrites our deficits, and allows consumers to access goods at a fraction of their historical cost. The dollar’s dominance gives us latitude that no other nation enjoys -- we can consume more than we produce, year after year, because the world still wants what we sell: our assets.

Still, beneath the surface lies a more fundamental tension: the difference between symbols and substance.

Money, after all, is a symbol. Debt is a symbol. Equities, IOUs, financial instruments -- they’re abstractions. But goods are real. When we trade symbols for substance -- when we exchange Treasury bonds for tractors, or equity for semiconductors -- we’re exporting our claim on tomorrow for the tangible needs of today.

And that trade becomes dangerous when the means of production vanish. When the factories close. When the tools of self-reliance rust. You can’t eat a bond certificate. You can’t drive a spreadsheet. In a true crisis, it’s not your ledger that feeds you -- it’s your ability to build, to grow, to produce. If that capacity has been offshored in the name of efficiency, you’re left holding symbols while someone else holds the means of survival.

So should we panic? No. But we should pay attention. Trade deficits themselves aren’t evil -- they’re signals. They tell us how capital is moving, how confidence flows, how global priorities shift. The danger comes when we ignore what those signals are saying. When we fail to invest in our own future. When we become so dependent on foreign capital that we stop asking hard questions about what we’re using it for.

Because in the end, the real question isn’t whether we’re running a trade deficit -- it’s whether we’re building a future worth owning.

Imagine a landlord who, little by little, sells off rooms in their home to fund vacations. The lifestyle improves -- for a while. But one day, the house is no longer theirs. That’s not just a metaphor. It’s a trajectory. Not inevitable, but possible.

And that’s why this isn’t just an economic curiosity -- it’s a philosophical one. The trade deficit is a mirror, reflecting what we value. Do we prioritize symbols over substance? Consumption over creation? The present over the future?

The link between trade deficits and capital surpluses reveals more than an economic mechanism. It exposes the soul of a nation, caught between the gravity of its past and the weightless momentum of its illusions.

An important first step is for Americans to become economically literate so that they can have a say in the direction we choose. If we limit ourselves to simply reading the talking points of politicians without understanding the underlying premises, we're never going to make informed decision.

**Grok-3:** The café was quiet, save for the soft clink of cups and the hum of a distant espresso machine. I slid into a corner booth, a worn notebook in hand, the article I’d just read still buzzing in my mind. Across from me sat… me. Or rather, another version of myself—call it my reflective side, the one who asks the hard questions. We’d done this before, these internal dialogues where I wrestle with ideas. Today, the U.S. trade deficit and its mirror, the capital surplus, were on the table.

“So,” Reflective Me began, stirring a black coffee, “you read this piece about America buying more than it sells. What’s it got you thinking?”

I leaned back, flipping open my notebook where I’d jotted some notes. “It’s unsettling, but not in the way I expected. I always thought a trade deficit was just… bad. Like we’re bleeding money. But it’s not that simple. It’s tied to this capital surplus—foreigners buying our bonds, our companies, our land. It’s like we’re trading pieces of the future to pay for today’s stuff.”

Reflective Me raised an eyebrow. “And that doesn’t scare you? Selling off the house to fund the party?”

“It does,” I admitted, tapping my pen. “But it’s also kind of genius. The world trusts the dollar, trusts America’s system, so we get to live beyond our means. Cheap goods, low interest rates, startups funded by foreign cash—it’s a sweet deal. Until it isn’t.”

“Until it isn’t,” Reflective Me echoed, leaning forward. “What’s the catch? You sounded worried when you mentioned ‘pieces of the future.’”

I sighed, glancing at my notes. “The catch is what we’re giving up. Factories closing, towns dying, skills fading. We’re trading real stuff—production, self-reliance—for symbols. Bonds, stocks, debt. If a crisis hits and we’ve offshored our ability to make things, what then? You can’t eat a Treasury note.”

Reflective Me nodded, eyes narrowing. “So it’s about resilience. Or the lack of it. But isn’t this just how the world works now? Global markets, comparative advantage—America innovates, others manufacture. Why fight it?”

“Because it feels like a slow bleed,” I said, my voice sharper than I intended. “Innovation’s great, but if we’re just a nation of apps and algorithms while someone else makes the chips, the machines, the food… we’re vulnerable. The article talked about deindustrialization, how capital inflows mask the decline. We’re sedated by cheap iPhones and stock market highs, but what’s the cost?”

Reflective Me sipped their coffee, thoughtful. “Okay, but the article also said this isn’t all doom. Foreign investment fuels growth. Consumers benefit. The dollar’s king. Maybe it’s a fair trade—our assets for their goods.”

I frowned, flipping to a page where I’d underlined a line about the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. “Yeah, the dollar’s our ace. It lets us run deficits no one else could. But that’s also the trap. We’re so comfortable leaning on it, we’re not asking what happens if that trust wanes. Or if we keep hollowing out our industrial base. It’s like the landlord selling rooms to fund vacations. Feels great until you’re locked out of your own house.”

Reflective Me tilted their head. “So what does this mean to you, personally? You’re not a policymaker. You’re just a guy in a café.”

I laughed, but it was hollow. “It makes me feel… complicit. I buy the cheap stuff, I cheer the stock market, I live in this system. But it’s also a wake-up call. I need to understand this better—economics, trade, how it all connects. The article said economic literacy is the first step. If I don’t get the basics, I’m just nodding along to whatever politicians or pundits say.”

Reflective Me smirked. “You? Economically literate? That’s a tall order.”

“Hey,” I shot back, “I’m trying. This stuff matters. It’s not just numbers—it’s about what we value. Consumption versus creation. Short-term wins versus long-term strength. I want to be part of the conversation, not just a bystander.”

Reflective Me set down their cup, serious now. “Fair enough. But what’s the next step? You can’t fix the trade deficit yourself.”

“No, but I can start small,” I said, closing my notebook. “Read more, ask questions, support local businesses when I can. Maybe push for policies that rebuild resilience—education, infrastructure, industry. And honestly? Just think harder about what I’m buying and why. Every choice is a vote for the future I want.”

Reflective Me nodded, a faint smile breaking through. “Sounds like a plan. But don’t get too preachy. You still need to live in the world as it is.”

I grinned, standing to leave. “Deal. But I’m keeping my eyes open. This trade deficit thing—it’s not just economics. It’s a mirror. And I don’t want to look away.”

# 😩 My Life Before MTOLYN: Constant Fatigue, Stress, and Brain Fog

I’m a full-time professional, a parent, and trying to balance a million things at once. Over the past few years, I found myself dragging through the day. No matter how much sleep I got, I woke up tired. I had zero motivation, my mental clarity was declining, and my overall health just wasn’t what it used to be.

Coffee stopped working. Energy drinks gave me crashes. Vitamins? Tried them all. Nothing worked long-term.

I knew I needed something different—something that actually **addressed the root causes** of my fatigue and lack of focus.

# 🤔 The Turning Point: Discovering MTOLYN

I stumbled across MTOLYN through a Facebook group where people were raving about how it transformed their health and energy levels. At first, I rolled my eyes — “just another overhyped supplement,” I thought.

But the more I read, the more intrigued I became. What stood out was that **MTOLYN isn’t just a quick fix**. It’s formulated to support your body from the inside out — improving energy, mental focus, gut health, and even your immune system.

The ingredients were clean, clinically backed, and the formula made sense. After reading dozens of glowing testimonials, I decided to give it a try.

* **Day 3:** I woke up feeling… awake. That’s the best way I can put it. I didn’t hit snooze. I didn’t drag myself to the kitchen for coffee. I actually **felt ready** to take on the day.
* **Day 7:** My afternoon crashes were gone. My mind felt sharper. I was finishing work faster and even had the energy to exercise after work (something I hadn’t done in over a year).
* **Week 2:** My skin looked clearer. My digestion improved. I wasn’t bloated anymore, and my mood was so much better. Even my friends and coworkers noticed. “You look so much more alive,” one of them said.
* **Week 4 and beyond:** I started setting goals again. I had the energy, clarity, and motivation to work on side projects, hit the gym, and truly enjoy time with my family. It’s not just that I felt better — I felt like I had my **life back**.

# 🌿 Why MTOLYN Works When Others Fail

Here’s why I think MTOLYN is different (and superior):

2. **Full-Body Benefits** – MTOLYN isn’t just for energy. It supports digestion, focus, immunity, inflammation response, and even skin clarity. It’s like 6 supplements in 1.
3. **No Crash, No Jitters** – Unlike caffeine or stimulants, MTOLYN gives you **natural, sustained energy** all day. You just feel like your optimal self.
4. **Transparent Company** – I did my homework. MTOLYN is manufactured in FDA-registered, GMP-certified facilities. They’re transparent about their sourcing, testing, and quality control.
5. **Thousands of Real Testimonials** – This isn’t some overnight hype. People from all walks of life — from busy moms to elite athletes — swear by this product.

# 🔥 My Top Reasons Why You NEED to Try MTOLYN

If you’re still reading, and you’re still unsure — let me be blunt.

**You owe it to yourself to try this.**

You don’t need to believe every word I say — just try it. You’ll see what I mean.

* It’s affordable.
* There’s a satisfaction guarantee.

This woman asked a question, and I answered it along with more than a dozen other people.

She also posted about her lost pet. People who lived in her subdivision said they'll be on the lookout, I also posted some advice when my small, but old dog got out of my backyard when the bug guy left my side gate ajar. Her pet was found.

I didn't know her or know that she made both posts. She contacts through the direct messenger chat asking if I'm American because I look Asian. You can be both American and look Asian. My parents moved here, and I was born here.

She's Chinese and she says she's 48. She's looking for a friend. This isn't a place devoid of Asians, but folks of Asian descent aren't very common. It's a fairly white area.

She did send me a photo of her. It was the same photo she uses as her profile picture on the app. She asked me for a recent photo, and I sent her a snapshot I took of my not-too-ugly mug. I'm 61 and look much younger. Her photo looks a lot younger than 48, but Asians hold their age well.

She wants to video chat.

I've told her I'm married, mainly an empty nester with a child that comes home from college during school breaks and holidays. My other children are long out of the house and in their 30s.

She usually chats with me when I'm at work. I work evenings and with commute, I'm gone from 1 PM to 12:30 AM. She's been chatting with me during my lunch hour (8-8:30 pm)

She did ask me to meet for coffee at first, but I was at work, and she didn't realize the length of time I'm at work. I'm literally gone for 12 hours straight.

I felt it's just 2 minutes task to grab that paper from the shelf, why wouldn't they do it? I could see all 3 counter people were free since 20 min with no more people in the area.

Just trying to understand if i'm not accounting for something and thinking too much.",0,1745043728.0,Netherlands,7,0.26,False

It’s not causal we go out to dinner get coffee movies I’ve even met her family. We go on trips together cabins in the winter cruises in the summer. Basically in the friends with benefits zone, oh and we have even begun exploring the kink D/s stuff. But she knows I like her seriously. She’s emotionally unavailable(corporate girl always work first) but also not dating or talking to other guys so it’s weird. I pretty much encourage her to date other people and she won’t. She says let’s just be friends and I don’t want to hurt you but I just don’t want a relationship. It’s kinda like dealing with a guy 🤣. Up until recently I didn’t know that she has a lot of trauma with guys including assault and being the girl guys use till they find the girl they want and they just dump her. She’s afraid to try because if it doesn’t work she doesn’t want that pain and to have to build herself again. Which is fair for me to understand but, if you don’t want to get hurt and you don’t want to hurt me. Then why are we doing this because I’m already hurting. I feel like we all know if a woman liked a man enough she’d risk everything even being shattered all over again to nothin. I just feel I’m not that guy she willing to take that level of risk on. I’ve become her safety blanket in a way if that makes sense. At the point of so I rip that bandaid off and just ghost her or tell her I just can’t do this anymore and let’s try to be friends but its likely I’ll just have to stop seeing and talking to her.",2,1745043624.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False

Bella’s POV

The air in Aspen’s mansion hums with pre-party chaos, a mix of cleaning solution and the faint tang of limes I’m slicing for the bar. I’m perched on a barstool in his sprawling kitchen, fairy lights dangling from my fingers as I weave them around a makeshift photo booth frame. The place is a palace—marble counters, vaulted ceilings, a pool glinting through the glass doors—but it’s Aspen’s easy grin as he hauls in a keg that makes it feel alive. Tonight’s party will be a Yura University legend, and I’m here, heart racing, helping him make it happen. My floral dress catches on the stool, and I laugh, brushing it off. Aspen catches my eye, winking, and for a second, the world’s just us.

I wasn’t always this girl, the one who lights up rooms and loves fiercely. Growing up in a cramped apartment on the edge of the city, I was Isabella, the kid with hand-me-down sneakers and a chip on her shoulder. Mom worked double shifts at a diner, Dad was long gone, and my older brother, Nico, was in and out of juvie. Our neighborhood was all graffiti and broken streetlights, but it taught me to read people fast—who’d stab you in the back, who’d have yours. School was my escape. I was scrappy, mouthy, always debating teachers or sneaking into the art room to doodle. But I got in fights, too, defending kids like Fern, who reminded me of the quiet dreamers I’d see on the bus, heads down, hoping to be invisible. I swore I’d claw my way out, be someone who mattered.

Yura was my ticket. A scholarship landed me here, and I remade myself—Bella, not Isabella, with a laugh that disarms and a knack for pulling people together. The Glitch Club started as a joke, just me, Fern, Vada, and Olivia hiding out at Neon Café, swapping stories over burnt coffee. Now it’s home, a family I chose. Fern’s got this quiet strength, Vada’s a wildfire, Olivia’s all heart. Aspen’s the bonus, my unexpected everything. I met him in psych class, his sly smile daring me to keep up. He’s rich, sure, but it’s his nerdy side—rambling about constellations—that hooked me. He’s mine, and I’m his, no matter how many girls like Ana bat their lashes.

I’m stringing lights when my phone buzzes. It’s Olivia, forwarding that nasty text from Ana’s crew: Hope the killer gets u next. My blood boils. Ana’s been a thorn since I shut her out of Glitch Club—she was too fake, too cruel. Now she’s playing dirty, using the slasher rumors to scare us. That smiley face emoji makes my skin crawl, too much like the mask left at the murders. Two kids dead, one at Delta House, one in the park. I’ve seen the campus alerts, heard the whispers about a tall guy in a hoodie, knife or axe flashing. I’m not scared, not exactly, but I’m not stupid either. I text Olivia: Ignore them. You’re untouchable. She sends a heart emoji, and I exhale, refocusing on the lights.

Aspen’s testing the sound system, bass vibrating the floor. “Babe, you’re a genius with those lights,” he calls, and I grin, tossing a lime at him. He catches it, laughing, and I hop down to help him move a table. We’re a team, always have been. I spot Vada and Fern at the door, dragging in a speaker, Fern’s glasses fogged from the effort. “Yo, this place is insane!” Vada hollers, and I wave them over, handing Fern a soda. “You ready for this?” I ask.

 She nods, but her eyes flicker—nervous, maybe, about the slasher talk. I squeeze her shoulder. “We stick together, okay?”
Ana’s coming tonight, probably in some dress that costs more than my rent. She’s been gunning for Aspen, throwing shade at me and Fern like it’s her job. I’m not worried—she’s all bark. But that text to Olivia sits heavy. I glance at Aspen, his jaw tight as he reads another campus alert. The slasher’s out there, and this party’s a beacon. I push the thought down, focusing on the lights, the music, Aspen’s hand brushing mine. Tonight’s ours. Let the world try to ruin it.",1,1745043537.0,SkullyBoy,0,1.0,False
