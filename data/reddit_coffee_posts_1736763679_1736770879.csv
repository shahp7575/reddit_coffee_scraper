The neon sign outside read ""Martin's Deli,"" a bright beacon against the fading twilight of Los Angeles. The smell of grilled meats and melted cheese wafted through the air, mingling with the faint hint of the Pacific breeze. Inside, the small paninoteca was bustling with the usual evening crowd—locals grabbing a quick bite after work, friends catching up over sandwiches, and the occasional late-night wanderer lured by the savory aromas.

Martin, the owner and head chef, was behind the counter, his hands deftly assembling a towering panino, layers of prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and arugula spilling out from between the toasted ciabatta. His face was a mix of concentration and joy; he loved this place, this rhythm of service, and the community it fostered. 

George, his right-hand man, was busy at the grill, flipping patties and checking on the fries, his laughter ringing out as he joked with the customers. The two men had been friends since childhood, their bond forged in the kitchens of their mothers and the streets of their neighborhood.

Lena, the newest addition to the team, was sweeping the floor, her eyes darting around as she took in the lively atmosphere. She had recently moved to LA, chasing dreams of stardom but finding herself drawn to the warmth of the deli. There was something about the place that felt like home, even if it was just a temporary stop on her journey.

As the dinner rush began to settle, Martin wiped his brow and turned to George. “Hey, did you see the guy who came in earlier? The one in the leather jacket?” 

George shrugged, flipping a burger. “Yeah, he seemed a little off. Why?”

“He ordered a sandwich and paid in cash, but he kept looking over his shoulder. I don’t like the vibe.”

Lena, overhearing their conversation, leaned in. “Should we be concerned? It’s a deli, not a crime scene.”

Martin chuckled but his expression was serious. “In this city, you never know. Just keep an eye out, okay?”

As the night wore on, the crowd began to thin, and the familiar sounds of the grill and the chatter of the few remaining customers filled the air. But just as Martin was about to close up for the night, the door swung open with a clang, and in walked the man in the leather jacket.

His presence was commanding, and the laughter in the deli quieted as he scanned the room. Martin felt a chill run down his spine. The man approached the counter, his eyes narrowing as they locked onto Martin’s.

“I need to talk to you,” the man said, his voice low and gravelly.

“Sorry, we’re closing,” Martin replied, trying to keep his tone steady.

The man leaned in closer, his breath heavy with the scent of cigarette smoke. “This isn’t a request.”

Before Martin could respond, George stepped forward, a protective stance taking over. “Hey, buddy, you need to back off.”

The man’s gaze shifted to George, and for a moment, the tension in the room crackled like static electricity. Lena stood frozen, her heart racing, sensing that something was about to unfold.

“Just a simple conversation,” the man said, his smile not reaching his eyes. “You know something you shouldn’t.”

Martin’s mind raced. What did this man know? And why did he feel like this was just the beginning of something much darker?

As the clock ticked towards midnight, the city outside buzzed with life, unaware of the storm brewing within the walls of Martin’s Deli. Secrets simmered beneath the surface, and in a city where dreams and nightmares often collided, this was one meal that was about to turn sour.### Chapter 2: Unraveling Threads

The tension in the deli thickened like the steam rising from the grill. Martin’s heart raced as he tried to gauge the man’s intentions. He could feel George’s protective energy beside him, but the uncertainty of the situation gnawed at him.

“Look, I don’t know what you think you know,” Martin said, keeping his voice steady. “But this is just a sandwich shop. We don’t want any trouble.”

The man chuckled, a low, menacing sound that sent a shiver down Lena’s spine. “Oh, but you’re mistaken, my friend. This isn’t just a sandwich shop. It’s a crossroads. And you, Martin, are at the center of it.”

George stepped forward, his fists clenched. “You need to leave. Now.”

The man’s eyes flicked to George, assessing, then returned to Martin. “You’re smarter than you look. I respect that. But you’re in way over your head. I’m giving you a chance to come clean.”

Martin exchanged a glance with George, who nodded slightly. They had been through a lot together, but this felt different. He was about to respond when Lena, unable to contain her curiosity any longer, spoke up.

“Why don’t you tell us what you’re talking about?” she asked, her voice shaking but defiant. “What do you want with Martin?”

The man turned to her, his expression softening momentarily, as if he hadn’t expected her to speak. “You’re brave, I’ll give you that. But bravery can be a dangerous game in this city.”

“Enough with the riddles,” George said, his voice firm. “What do you want?”

The man leaned closer, lowering his voice. “I want to know where the packages went.”

Martin’s stomach dropped. He had heard whispers about shipments and deals, but he never thought they would touch his little deli. “What packages?” he asked, feigning ignorance even as fear coursed through him.

“Don’t play dumb with me,” the man hissed. “I know you’re involved. You’ve been acting as a front, haven’t you? It’s clever, using a deli to mask the real business. But it’s time to choose a side.”

Lena’s eyes widened. “What are you talking about? We don’t know anything about any business!”

“Maybe not yet,” the man said, straightening up. “But you’re in this deeper than you realize. Just remember, Martin, I’ll be watching. And if you want to stay out of trouble, you should think about what I said.”

With that, the man turned on his heel and strode out of the deli, the door slamming shut behind him. The three of them stood in a stunned silence, the weight of what had just transpired settling heavily in the air.

“What the hell was that?” George finally exclaimed, his voice rising in disbelief. “Packages? What does he mean?”

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his mind racing as he tried to piece together the fragments of the encounter. “But we need to figure this out. We can’t let this guy think we’re involved in something we’re not.”

Lena, still shaken, spoke up. “What if he’s right? What if we are in over our heads? This isn’t just about sandwiches anymore.”

Martin took a deep breath, his resolve hardening. “We’ll find out what’s really going on. We need to dig deeper. If there’s something hidden here, we can’t just sit back and let it come to us.”

George nodded, his expression serious. “So what’s our first step?”

Martin glanced around the deli, feeling the weight of the walls closing in. “We need to check the back storage area. If there’s anything suspicious, that’s where it will be. And we need to do it now, before he comes back.”

The three of them moved cautiously toward the back of the deli, adrenaline coursing through their veins. As they approached the storage area, Martin felt a mix of determination and dread. Whatever secrets lay hidden in the shadows of Martin’s Deli were about to be uncovered, and there was no turning back now.

They pushed open the door to the storage room, the flickering fluorescent lights casting eerie shadows on the shelves stacked high with supplies. But as they stepped inside, a sense of foreboding filled the air. It was time to confront the truth, no matter how dangerous it might be.### Chapter 3: Shadows in the Back

The storage room was dimly lit, the fluorescent lights buzzing like angry bees overhead. Shelves lined the walls, crammed with boxes of bread, bags of flour, and jars of condiments. But as Martin scanned the space, his eyes landed on a corner that felt out of place—an area shrouded in darkness, tucked away behind a stack of crates.

“Over there,” Martin whispered, pointing towards the shadows. George and Lena exchanged nervous glances but nodded, their collective instincts urging them forward.

As they approached, Martin’s heart raced. What were they about to uncover? He reached for the nearest crate and began to move it aside, revealing a small door that had been partially hidden from view. Its surface was worn, and the handle was cold to the touch.

“Is this even part of the deli?” Lena asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his curiosity piqued. “But it’s time we find out.”

With a deep breath, he turned the handle and pushed the door open. It creaked ominously, revealing a narrow staircase leading down into darkness. The air was musty, and the sound of dripping water echoed from below.

“Should we really go down there?” George asked, hesitating at the top of the stairs.

“We have to,” Martin said firmly. “If there’s something happening here that we don’t know about, we need to uncover it. For our safety—and for the deli.”

Lena nodded, determination flickering in her eyes. “Let’s do it.”

With George leading the way, the three of them descended the staircase, each step heavy with anticipation. The air grew cooler, and the faint light from above quickly faded, leaving them in near darkness. Martin pulled out his phone, using the flashlight to illuminate their path as they reached the bottom.

They found themselves in a small, dimly lit basement. The space was cluttered with old equipment, discarded boxes, and a few crates that looked newer than the rest. But what caught Martin's eye was a large table in the center of the room, covered with documents and scattered items.

“What is all this?” George asked, stepping closer to the table. 

Martin moved to the table, his mind racing as he scanned the papers. Some were invoices, while others seemed to be shipping documents. His stomach sank as he read a few familiar names—names associated with less than reputable dealings in Los Angeles.

“Looks like a distribution list,” he murmured, his voice thick with disbelief. “And these… these are addresses. They’re not just sandwiches being shipped out of here.”

Lena leaned over, her eyes wide. “Martin, this is serious. What if he’s right? What if we’ve been unknowingly involved in something illegal?”

Before Martin could respond, a noise echoed from above—the unmistakable sound of footsteps. George’s eyes widened in alarm. “We need to get out of here. Now.”

They quickly moved to the staircase, but Martin hesitated. “Wait! We can’t just leave this behind. We need proof.”

“Proof of what?” George hissed, glancing nervously at the stairs. “That we’ve got a secret drug operation in our deli? Are you crazy?”

“Just give me a minute,” Martin replied, rummaging through the papers. He grabbed a few documents, focusing on the addresses and names that seemed most relevant. 

Lena, glancing back toward the staircase, said, “Hurry! We can’t stay here.”

Just as Martin stuffed the papers into his bag, the footsteps grew louder, and a shadow fell across the top of the stairs. Panic surged through him. They had to act quickly.

“Go!” he shouted, and they scrambled back up the stairs, adrenaline pushing them forward.

As they burst into the storage room, Martin's heart sank. The front door swung open, and in stepped the man in the leather jacket, flanked by two others. The atmosphere shifted instantly, the air charged with danger.

“Thought you could hide from me?” the man sneered, his eyes glinting with malice. “You should’ve stayed away from things that don’t concern you.”

George moved to shield Lena, but Martin stepped forward, defiance fueling his voice. “You don’t know what we’ve found. We’re not afraid of you.”

The man laughed, a hollow sound that echoed in the small space. “Brave words for someone who’s already in over his head. You have no idea who you’re dealing with.”

Lena, trembling but resolute, whispered to Martin, “What do we do?”

In that moment, Martin felt a mix of fear and determination. They had uncovered something dangerous, and now it was time to confront it head-on. “We fight for our deli. We fight for our lives.”

With a swift movement, Martin grabbed a nearby crate and hurled it toward the man, hoping to create a distraction. Chaos erupted as the crate crashed to the ground, sending papers flying and the group scattering.

“Run!” Martin shouted, and the three of them dashed for the exit, adrenaline pumping through their veins as they raced against time and the danger closing in around them. 

The deli was their sanctuary, but now it felt like a battleground. The stakes had never been higher, and the shadows of their past were catching up to them. If they wanted to survive, they had to uncover the truth—before it was too late.### Chapter 4: Into the Fray

They burst through the front door of Martin’s Deli, the cool night air hitting their faces like a splash of cold water. Martin glanced back at the deli, heart pounding. The man in the leather jacket and his accomplices were still inside, but they didn’t have time to think about that now. They had to get somewhere safe.

“Where do we go?” Lena asked, her voice trembling as they ran down the street, the neon lights of the deli flickering behind them.

“Back to my apartment,” Martin replied, urgency lacing his words. “It’s not far, and it’ll give us a place to regroup.”

George nodded, keeping an eye on the street behind them. “Let’s move. We can’t let them catch up.”

They sprinted down the sidewalk, the familiar sights of Los Angeles blurring past them. The streets were alive with the sounds of cars honking and distant music, but all Martin could hear was the pounding of his heart and the realization that their lives had just taken a turn into darkness.

As they turned a corner, Martin led them into an alley. The shadows felt suffocating, but it was better than being out in the open. They slowed, catching their breath, and Martin pulled out his phone.

“Do you think we should call the police?” Lena asked, her eyes wide with fear.

“Not yet,” Martin replied, glancing at George. “If we go to the cops now, they might think we’re involved. We need to figure out what’s really going on first.”

George leaned against the wall, trying to catch his breath. “So what’s our plan? We can’t just sit here and wait.”

“I need to look at those documents again,” Martin said, determination setting in. “There might be something we can use. If we can find out who’s behind this, we can make a case. But we need to be careful.”

“Agreed,” George said, standing up straighter. “Let’s get to your apartment and figure this out.”

They emerged from the alley and made their way to Martin’s apartment, a small unit on the second floor of an old building. As they climbed the stairs, anxiety clawed at Martin’s insides. What if the man in the leather jacket had followed them? What if they were walking straight into a trap?

Once inside, Martin locked the door and pulled the curtains shut. The dim light from a single bulb illuminated the cramped space filled with mismatched furniture and the lingering scent of stale coffee. They huddled around the small table, the papers from the storage room spread out before them.

“Okay, let’s see what we’ve got,” Martin said, his fingers trembling slightly as he sifted through the documents. “We need to find anything that can help us identify who’s behind this.”

Lena leaned in, scanning the papers. “These addresses… they look like they’re spread all over the city. What if these are just drop points?”

“Exactly,” Martin replied, piecing together the puzzle. “If we can connect these addresses to a bigger operation, we might be able to figure out who’s running it.”

George flipped through the documents, his brow furrowed in concentration. “What about this one?” He pointed at a name listed on an invoice. “This guy has a reputation. I’ve heard whispers about him in the neighborhood—deals gone bad, people disappearing.”

Lena looked up, her face pale. “You mean he’s dangerous?”

“Very,” George confirmed, his voice serious. “If he’s involved, we’re in deeper trouble than we thought.”

Martin’s mind raced. They needed to act fast. “We can’t let this go. If we report this to the right people, we might be able to expose whatever’s happening. But we need evidence—something solid.”

“Then we should check out one of these addresses,” George suggested. “See if we can gather more information.”

Lena hesitated. “But what if they’re watching? What if they know we’re onto them?”

“Then we have to be smart about it,” Martin said, determination burning in his chest. “We move quickly and quietly. We can split up to cover more ground.”

George nodded. “I’ll take one of the addresses. It looks like a warehouse. You two can check out the other one—it’s a small storage facility.”

Lena bit her lip. “What if something goes wrong?”

Martin met her gaze, his expression firm. “We have to be brave. We can’t let fear control us. We’ll stick to our phones and check in regularly. If anything feels off, we bail. Agreed?”

“Agreed,” George and Lena said in unison, a newfound sense of resolve settling over them.

As they gathered their things, Martin felt a rush of adrenaline. They were stepping into the unknown, but they were also taking control of their lives again. Whatever shadows lurked in the city tonight, they wouldn’t face them alone.

With one last look around the apartment, Martin led the way out, locking the door behind them. The night was waiting, and the answers they sought were just beyond the darkness. They were about to plunge deeper into a world of secrets and danger, and there was no turning back now.### Chapter 5: The Warehouse

The streets of Los Angeles pulsed with life, but for Martin, Lena, and George, the vibrant city felt like a backdrop to a dark film. As they moved towards their separate destinations, the weight of their mission hung heavily on their shoulders. Each step felt like a step into the unknown, and the thrill of danger coursed through their veins.

Martin and Lena arrived at a nondescript storage facility nestled between two larger buildings. The exterior was unremarkable—gray concrete, rusting metal doors, and a flickering overhead light that gave off a dull glow. Martin felt a knot tighten in his stomach. This was it. They were about to confront something that could change their lives forever.

“Are you ready?” Martin asked, glancing at Lena, who was taking deep breaths to steady her nerves.

“As ready as I’ll ever be,” she replied, her voice steadying. “Let’s just be careful.”

They approached the entrance, a large metal door that seemed to loom over them. Martin pulled out his phone to check the time; it was just after 10 PM. The facility was quiet, save for the distant hum of traffic. He glanced around, making sure no one was watching. 

“Okay, let’s see if it’s unlocked,” he said, testing the door handle. To his surprise, it turned easily, and the door creaked open. 

Inside, the air was stale, thick with dust and the faint scent of industrial cleaner. Martin turned on his phone’s flashlight, illuminating a narrow corridor lined with storage units. The walls were adorned with peeling paint and faded signage. 

“This place gives me the creeps,” Lena whispered, her voice echoing slightly in the silence. “Are you sure we should be here?”

“We need to find out what’s happening,” Martin replied, resolve hardening his voice. “We can’t turn back now.” 

They moved cautiously down the corridor, the beam of light from Martin’s phone cutting through the darkness. They paused at the first unit, marked with a faded number. Martin hesitated, then gently pulled the door open. It screeched on its hinges, and they both flinched.

Inside, the unit was empty, save for a few scattered boxes and a thick layer of dust. “Nothing here,” Martin muttered, his heart sinking. 

They continued down the row, checking each unit. Most were empty or filled with old furniture, but as they reached the end of the corridor, a faint sound caught Martin's attention—a muffled conversation coming from somewhere deeper within the facility.

“Did you hear that?” he whispered to Lena. She nodded, her eyes wide with fear.

“Let’s go check it out,” Martin said, his heart racing. They crept toward the source of the sound, which seemed to be coming from a larger unit at the far end.

As they approached, Martin could make out distinct voices—two men arguing heatedly. He pressed his ear against the door, straining to catch snippets of the conversation.

“...told you it was a bad idea!” one voice hissed, filled with frustration. “Now they’re onto us!”

“We can handle it. We just need to keep the shipments moving,” the other replied, calmer but with an underlying edge of menace. “We can’t let anyone find out.”

Martin exchanged a glance with Lena. They needed to know more, but how? 

“Should we go in?” Lena whispered, her voice barely audible.

“No,” Martin replied, his mind racing. “We need to find out what they’re planning without getting caught. Let’s see if we can find a way to listen in without being seen.”

They stepped back and scanned the corridor for any other openings. Martin spotted a small window near the top of the unit’s wall. “If we can climb up and look through, we might be able to see what’s happening inside.”

“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Lena asked, concern etched on her face. “What if they see us?”

“We’ll be quick,” Martin assured her. “We need this information.”

Together, they managed to find a stack of old crates nearby, using them to climb up to the window. Martin hoisted himself up first, peering through the grimy glass. The view inside was partially obscured, but he could make out the two men standing beside a table cluttered with packages.

“Look!” Martin whispered urgently, signaling for Lena to join him.

She climbed up next to him, her breath hitching as she focused on the scene inside. The two men were now rifling through boxes, pulling out neatly packed bags that glimmered under the dim light.

“Is that…?” Lena began, but Martin nodded, understanding her unspoken words. It was what they had feared—drugs, being processed and prepared for distribution.

“Looks like we were right,” Martin murmured, his heart pounding. “This is a major operation.”

As they continued to watch, one of the men pulled out a phone and spoke into it, his tone urgent. “We need to move the product tonight. I don’t care what it takes. If anyone gets in our way, deal with them. We can’t afford any mistakes.”

Lena’s eyes widened in horror. “Did you hear that? They’re not just dealing drugs; they’re threatening people!”

Martin felt a surge of adrenaline and fear. “We need to get this evidence back to George and figure out our next move. But we have to be careful. If they see us leaving…”

Before he could finish, the door to the unit swung open, and one of the men stepped out, glancing around suspiciously. Martin and Lena froze, hearts racing as they pressed themselves against the wall, barely breathing.

The man took a few steps down the corridor, scanning the area. “What was that?” he muttered to himself, his eyes narrowing.

Lena’s grip tightened around Martin’s arm, and he could feel the tension in the air. They had to act fast.

“Let’s go,” he whispered urgently, and they scrambled down from the crates, hearts pounding in sync with their footsteps as they moved quickly but quietly back toward the entrance.

They could feel the weight of danger closing in around them, and as they reached the door, Martin glanced back, knowing this was just the beginning. They had uncovered something monumental, but now they had to get out alive—and fast.",1,1736770669.0,ebookdeals,0,1.0,False

The sound of steel against the half full bowl of cereal was a grinding noise that whittled away at my already strained mental state. I had risen early with the intention of making something nice for Grace and I. Only for those intentions of being dashed almost immediately when I had descended the stairs to find Grace sitting at the dining room table with a cup of coffee in hand. Waiting for me to join her.

Without the motivation to cook something more for the both of us, grabbing the nearest prepackaged box became the only easy solution.

I had taken my seat at the other head of the table and started to dig into my food without any real enthusiasm or desire to finish the meal. Now I had taken to running the spoon along the edge of the bowl, the unpleasant scraping of ceramic on wet steel squeaking across the table with a sharpness that brought out a grimace from both of us every time I succeeded in hitting a high note.

“Please stop that.” Grace murmured, lifting her mug as she did so. “You know that sounds awful.” I nodded in agreement, pushing the spoon into the bowl before glancing up from the congealed milk and circular wet loops to look at Grace.

I can’t do her justice in describing her but I’ll still give it my best. She has a soft, narrow face with a peachy skin that perfectly accompanies her light steel blonde hair which is always done up in a bonytail save for a few perfectly placed lopsided locks that drift in waves over her cheeks. Her eyes are a sea green, almost a bright cyan blue that is quite striking and has always been one of my favourite things about her appearance.

She must have noticed me watching her and simply chosen not to respond. Taking a long sip of her drink before she rested it back in place on its coaster. Sticking out against the circular marks left by my inability to implement the tiny piece of wood.

“I saw your car.” She nodded behind me to the wreck of a vehicle that I had been able to navigate home. “Was it a bad crash?” She flicked the tip of her finger towards my face and my poor brutalised nose that had been battered all throughout the last night.

I did my best to give her a bemused smile that accompanied a shake of the head. It wasn’t bad. Just bad luck and poor observations that led to the thick plaster that I had placed across the bridge of my nose. She didn’t need to worry.

“No, thankfully the car still works alright, I’ll go get repairs in the city after work.”

“Do you need a ride home?” Her immediacy caught me off guard. It was uncharacteristic for her to be so willing to keep a conversation going. Offering a lift when my own car was broken was also something I hadn’t expected from her. But I didn’t feel that I could take her up on the offer. I didn’t want to be a burden more than I already had and I knew that she was only keeping me entertained out of pity for my nightmare and the bad blows to my face.

I wouldn’t force her to spend more time around me then she already had to bear. Imposing my own presence on her wouldn’t do any good. Although a small inkling inside my brain fought against these notions. What if she genuinely wanted to spend time with me? What if my odd behaviour from the last night had been able to catch more than just pity?

Doubtful.

Finally in response to her offer I shook my head again.

“Thank you, but I'll be good, I can rent a car or get a taxi.” Grace nodded politely as I rejected her offer. The corners of her eyes screwed up with a pained yet careful restraint, a pang of guilt twitched in my chest and I knew I’d made a mistake.

I stood up abruptly from my seat and started to wander back out towards my wrecked car, words falling in mumbling trails from my lips as I tried to string together an apology or half measure that I could offer.

“I have to go, can we talk later?” I was speaking too quickly and we both knew it as she bobbed her head and was already making her way out of her seat.

“Sure,” Grace’s words left in an exhale as she pried her cup off the table and turned back to the sink.

I was already out the door, walking at a brisk pace as I tried to outrun the embarrassment of my poor choices. I didn’t need to think about that or what I could have said differently, today was one that I needed to focus on, I had work. Then I could focus on fixing things after work. I’d apologise to Grace, I’d apologise for everything and really set things right.

My thoughts were temporarily halted as a strange lingering notion sat in the air around me. I was standing in the same spot that I had seen occupied by the strange man the previous night. In my haze of half sleep as he watched me from behind the edges of my desecrated car.

Tasting a drink of air on my tongue a sudden bitter chill washed its way down my throat causing me to gag. Of all the thoughts I needed to push down, that was especially one that needed to stay back. Fictitious weavings of my delirious mind appearing around me were unneeded and unwanted.

But even so I still considered how I stood in the same place he had. Watching through that large window to the occupants of the household that lay within its interior. Treading over familiar surfaces and shielded by the walls of the house’s thick armour. Now I could only see Grace living inside the home.

I coughed as I felt a warm wet sensation settle upon the back of my neck and I wrenched my eyes away from where she stood, cleaning her mug with the cold water that ran over her hands.

I felt a peculiar kind of disgust with myself as I limply lifted one of my hands to the car's handle and my eyes caught a strange set of markings towards the car’s crumpled hood.

I couldn’t tell if the markings had been there the previous night and were simply part of the wreck that had occurred after I had collided with the young moose. Four deep scratches that all ran parallel to each other towards the right headlight.

I was seeing things, it was part of the wreck and being paranoid wasn’t going to make my life easier. I didn’t need to invent hardships. Come on mark, this is ridiculous. 

Without a second thought I sat down in the driver's seat and made my way along the winding road towards Vancouver. Eclipsing the mileage of trees that encroached on the highway and fixing my gaze on the painted white strips along the concrete path. Occasionally letting my eyes wander to those four perfect scratches.

…

“So Mark, thoughts?” The chipper voice of my coworker, Charles, curiously crawled along the lobes of my ears as I watched, aghast and horrified by the racks of metal cages that lay behind thick panes of glass. Separating the pair of us from the subjects-to-be as they cried and bayed from within their tiny confinements.

Behind that glass pane were nine fully grown, male chimpanzees. All of which were hairless and actively antagonising each other through the bars of their cages.

I wasn’t even sure what to say. I felt stuck to the spot as I observed the chimps hollering cries, the rest of the bustle and footfall in the hallway behind us fading into a fuzzy blur that only served to be additional white noise. I could feel my mouth hanging open with shock as I turned slowly to stare directly at my colleague.

Charles was only slightly younger than I was, but that was still pushing it, he had a naive face with a toothy smile and a stubby nose. Curly red brown locks floating over his cheeks and adding to his own youthful expression. In the moment I wanted nothing more than to slap him and turn that rosy face into a deep black blue. How could he look that… content, with such a deeply confronting sight before us?

“What on earth am I looking at?” I tried to demand in a way that was forceful but still respectful of him as my equal.

His eyes shifted in slight confusion as his mouth screwed up in a strangely exaggerated confusion before he opened his mouth ever so slightly to reply.

“The… subjects? The ones were testing the new batch on?” His voice was full of a condescending matter of factness that only made it harder to hold my tone in line and prevent myself from snapping at him.

“Yeah, no, I got that, I meant since when are we using chimps?” He only replied with a vacant stare, unresponsive to my previous question.

“Charles, how the hell are we even using chimps? How did they get here? How did nothing cross my desk? Who wrote off on this?” Question after question I continued to lambast his dismissal of the chimps being so nonchalant.

“Doesn’t it make sense?” A reply that only confused me further as I failed to grasp his meaning.

“The meds are meant for human illnesses, the brain structure of chimps is closer to humans than any of the rodents. I thought someone just figured the same and was able to pull a few strings.” I wasn’t even sure how true that was. It made sense logically to assume the chimps may far better then the tiny lab rats that had been standard issue for animal testing. Although the use of apes made things… difficult. What if someone found out? They’d be hell to pay for sure.

But more than that I found it deeply unnerving to be conducting experiments on a creature not that far off from humans.

Have any of you seen a chimp? In person and shaved bare? Its almost uncanny how close to the human body their own anatomy resembles. Short and stout masses of muscle sinew and greyed skin with an outer layer that was worn with the hardships of life. Faces with overlong ears pushed too far back along their scap and mouths of twisted canines that peeled back behind large lips. Among their menacing and uncanny attributes I found their eyes to be deeply unnerving.

Shining pupils that hinted at a level of intelligence that was easy to underestimate. Constantly flickering and turning to examine the room and especially the unaware human captors.

“Mark, come on, let’s get this over with.” Charles lowered his gaze to the locker that sat beside the sliding door and was already loading a gun with a tranquilliser.

Necessary safety procedures I supposed, especially regarding the size of the experiment's participants.

Charles led the way into the room as I followed reaching into the same locker to retrieve a pair of syringes containing the new experimental drugs that with any luck would have been a major breakthrough in our research and a huge step forward in its respective field.

Now, the two of us were standing inside the room with the apes behind their cages. I heard a mechanical crunching noise of the locks being initiated on the door and knew that someone from the observation room was coordinating with our own actions. The observation room was behind a large one way mirror that blended in seamlessly with the rest of the walls.

Even in the moment it felt strange to lock the door behind us. Safety precautions and all but was it really necessary to keep the pair of us contained with the chimps?

Charles was beginning to approach the chimp to the far side of the room in the lower left corner of the grid and trying to prod the end of his gun through the bars so that he could sedate the ape without missing. A task made more difficult than it was needed to due to the apes own efforts of pushing the barrel out of its cage before quickly darting back to the end of the container and coiling up into a ball. Repeating the erratic movements out of panic and fear.

“Damnit, stay still.” Charles huffed to himself as he continued to fiddle with the gun while I stood to the side holding the syringes like a pleb, waiting for him to sedate the chimp and growing increasingly irritated by how he handled the tool.

“Charles, let me…” I was about to butt in before he shoved the barrel of the tranq gun deep into the cage, prodding the chimp in its side and enraging the already paranoid animal.

It lashed out, grabbing the metal barrel and yanking it with such force that Charles fell forward and smashed his nose against the shelf above the chimp. A crack of cartilage barely audible above the chimps shouts as his nose twisted to its side.

Without thinking I rushed to his side as I simultaneously dropped the syringes I held, letting them clatter against the ground. My fingers scraped along his lab coat and then felt the muscles in his whole body seize up and a scream of pain rang out.

I wasn’t initially sure what happened as my eyes were still locked onto the tranq gun that the chimp at his waist was clutching and his face was pressed into the cage before him. My eyes took their time to reach the point where his neck ended and chin began. The point where another chimp had been able to press it’s fingers around the bar and beneath the tender skin that graced that cold metal.

The chimp was holding Charles’ face to the cage and gripping onto the bars at the same time. Hot blood gushing from his neck and tainting his brilliant white lab coat with dark ugly blotches. Charles had no clue how to react, his arms shooting off in all directions with every slight curling of the chimps fingers in his throat as he made an odd gurgling noise in place of a scream and his eyes had shrunk into themselves.

I wasn’t fairing much better. I was still helplessly clutching his sides, gently trying to pull him away from the chimp and failing at this bout of strength I was glancing back at the invisible mirror to my left. Screaming desperate pleas at whoever was meant to be observing our actions.

“Get help! We need help!”

By then the world turned upside down as I felt myself fall back under the weight of Charles’ as a pair of noises fell upon our ears.

The first and loudest of the two was a bending of metal and breaking of steel as the gun was leveraged against the metal bars to pry the front of its cage away. 

The second noise was one that even now is still ringing in my ears. A strange slick, wet sound that I can only describe as a stack of paper being ripped through all at once. Tearing of a thin piece of parchment away from a larger whole.

I knew what had happened and I was dreading when I would need to open my eyes and bear witness to the grizzly sight that lay around me. Feeling the weight of a limp, shivering body on top of me, accompanied with a dripping of warm liquid onto my chest that was living a gradually blossoming wet mark that burrowed deeper into my heart.

I could still feel Charles’ heart beating and in a second I was grateful that he was still alive and had simply fallen unconscious from the act I couldn’t bear to see.

I started to sit up. Keeping my eyes barred shut as I pulled myself back so that I could begin to gather my bearings. Eyes starting to flit open to scan the whole scene.

Only then noticing that the cries and choir of the pained subjects had fallen totally silent. My eyes darted up and fluttered across the whole array of nine cages in swift frantic motions. All of them were watching me from where I sat with an expressionless intelligent stare.

Their eyes deep and aware of the scene that lay before them as they held their hands over their knees and kept their mouths concealed from view. The ape who sat in the bottom left cage being the exception. It had crawled from its enclosure and now stood on its hands and feet, watching me with it’s beady human eyes.

It knew, it knew that I was stuck there with it. Its shining eyes reflected lethal sentience that sent waves of terror across my spine.",1,1736770566.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I had heard so much about the competitive job market and was prepared—both mentally and skill-wise—to face the challenge head-on.

# The Beginning: Hope Turns to Frustration

* **Month 1:** No calls, no responses—absolute silence from recruiters.
* **Month 2:** I began to adapt, polishing my resume and learning how the market worked.
* **Month 3:** I finally landed my first offer after three grueling rounds of interviews.

The offer wasn’t perfect, but it was a start. I noticed a small clause in the contract that needed clarification, so I called the manager who had sent the offer. He agreed with my concern and assured me it would be corrected. I felt optimistic.

But then, **radio silence for three days.** When I followed up, I was shocked to hear that the company no longer wanted me. They had hired a developer from another nationality for half the salary. A team leader later confirmed this to me.

I was devastated. I thought it was just bad luck.

# The Second Chance: From Bad to Worse

I started over with a new visa and renewed determination. After three more months of relentless job hunting, I accepted a job that paid **60% of the salary of the first offer, which was already below average.** I tried to stay positive and focus on moving forward.

But then I encountered something far worse: a **toxic workplace culture.** Within a week, it was glaringly obvious that employees were treated as little more than machines:

* Bathroom breaks? **You had to clock out and back in**, even for a few minutes.
* I once asked the CEO why there was no coffee for developers. His response? “Is it mentioned in the contract?”

Four months in, I was completely burned out. I left because I couldn’t take it anymore. But most of my colleagues couldn’t do the same—they had families and responsibilities. The business owner exploited this, knowing they had no choice but to endure.

1. **Connections Are Everything:** Around 95% of jobs and interviews happen through referrals.
2. **Exploitation Is Common:** Many people are willing to work for as little as 25% of a fair salary just to support their families, and companies know it.
3. **Burnout Culture:** Employees are treated as disposable, with no regard for their well-being.

1i0cl7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1i0cl7w/trapped_animal/,Trapped animal,"We were dating for almost 4 years, with 3 of those years living together.

He quit a job he wasn’t satisfied with, and we moved to the main city for better work opportunities. I got a job immediately, but he didn’t—well, he wasn’t even trying. He was sending CVs at the rate of 1 every 2 months, and obviously, he got rejected. I tried to help him find a job. Twice I tried networking through my friends and almost every week I sent him different job opportunities.

Turned out both jobs were “bad,” and all the offers were “beyond his skillset or wierd company""… okay.

When we were searching for a flat, I was the one who did the search and the tours of course the lease agreement was under my name. The rent was paid from my account.

When we moved in together, I told him to arrange the internet connection for us. I waited for more than a month until I ended up managing it myself.

The electricity was also handled by me and paid from my account.

He didn’t send me the money unless I asked, and I always felt bad for asking. Even though he had way more savings (a gift from his mother) than me, somehow, a new MacBook or a Camera (Sony Alfa a7) or new lens was more important than rent.

He stayed at home for almost 3 years, playing Counterstrike and drinking one beer after another. And he claimed to be “depressed.” I found 4 therapists for him near our flat. The first one had a funny name, the second had a weird website, and so on.

He didn’t do any of the household stuff. Laundry, cleaning, cooking—even minor repairs were left to me. Groceries? He didn’t like shopping, so I did that too.

I never got flowers from him, and I don’t recall a single birthday gift.

I always heard, “You’re not a supportive girlfriend.” When I replied, “Hey, I go to work, I do the groceries, I do the cleaning and cooking, and I even tried to find you a job and a therapist—what more can I do to support you?” he’d say, “You’re not giving me the emotional support I need.” Okay…

I hoped it would get better once he found a job, but nothing was happening.

It drove me crazy—to the point where I almost cried at work just seeing a male colleague clean up spilled coffee on the counter after himself.

I went to therapy, and my therapist said: “You know, I think he doesn’t care who stands beside him—whether it’s you, Amy, Lilly, or Anna—as long as the girl is taking care of him.”

That was my final wake-up call. I mean, I already knew I wanted to break up, but this was the eye-opener. I came home and told him I was done, that I couldn’t do this anymore. But it wasn’t a proper breakup.

Suddenly, he started looking for work. He started cleaning and doing the shopping. But I was done.

I cheated. He felt something was odd, but I denied it. Then, a month later, on New Year’s Eve, it came out.

He threw things at me, poured water on my face, spit on me and call me names. But I stayed. It wasn’t enough. I felt like I needed something more—something more harmful, like a slap—to finally walk away.

Then he told me to pack my things and leave.

I ran to my parents’ house and told my dad, feeling bad and guilty, thinking he would lecture me. But suddenly, he said, “Don’t worry. He wasn’t a good guy. It would’ve happened anyway.” I felt relief.

When I told my friends, feeling guilty, all of them said, “Yes, what you did was bad, but he was manipulative all the time, and we’re glad you’re out of it.”

Months after the breakup, I was receiving calls and texts, calling me a wh*re and a b*tch. He told me how much he’d changed, how I didn’t give him a single chance, and how he wanted to propose and have kids. I knew it was a trap.

It has been 2 years since the breakup, and I’ve found a supportive husband. Anyway, this experience is still with me, and I feel bad for cheating.
When I told my husband, he said: “Even a trapped animal will do everything to get out. You were a trapped animal. Don’t worry.”

Martin and Lena burst through the storage facility door, the night air wrapping around them like a cool embrace. They didn’t stop to catch their breath; fear propelled them forward as they sprinted down the alley, every shadow feeling like a threat. Their hearts raced, fueled by the adrenaline of their narrow escape.

“Did they see us?” Lena panted, glancing over her shoulder as they turned a corner. The darkened streets seemed to swallow their footsteps, but the tension in the air felt electric.

“I don’t think so,” Martin replied, trying to quell his own rising panic. “But we need to get to George and tell him what we found.”

They dashed down the sidewalk, weaving through a few late-night pedestrians, their eyes darting around for any sign of the men from the storage facility. The city was alive with the sounds of nightlife, but to Martin, it felt like a facade—something that could shatter in an instant.

Finally, they reached Martin’s apartment building, and he quickly led Lena inside. They climbed the stairs two at a time, their breaths coming in sharp gasps. Once inside, Martin locked the door behind them and turned to Lena, whose face was pale.

“What if they come after us?” she asked, her voice trembling slightly. 

“They might,” Martin admitted, his mind racing with possibilities. “But we have to focus. We need to get the evidence to George and figure out our next steps.”

Lena nodded, steeling herself. “What do you think he’ll say?”

“I don’t know, but we need to convince him this is serious. We can’t just walk away from this.”

Martin opened his laptop and quickly checked the time. It was nearing midnight. He sent a text to George, urging him to meet at the apartment. Then, they waited, the silence in the room thick with tension.

After what felt like an eternity, a soft knock echoed at the door. Martin’s heart raced as he opened it to reveal George, who looked anxious but relieved to see them.

“Thank God you’re safe,” George said, stepping inside and quickly closing the door behind him. “What happened?”

“We found a drug operation,” Martin blurted out, his voice urgent. “They’re using the storage facility as a front. We overheard them talking about shipments and threats.”

George’s eyes widened. “Are you serious? Did you get any proof?”

“Yes,” Martin replied, pulling the documents they had taken from his bag. “They’re all here. Addresses, names, everything.”

George quickly scanned the papers, frowning as he pieced together the implications. “This is bad. Really bad.”

“I know,” Lena added, her voice shaking slightly. “They’re dangerous, and they’ve already threatened people. We can’t just go to the police without a solid plan.”

“We need a strategy,” George said, pacing the room. “If we go to the authorities, they might be able to protect us, but we need to be sure they’ll take us seriously.”

Martin nodded, glancing at the clock. “We should gather more evidence—maybe even find out who’s behind this operation. If we can connect it to someone bigger, we’ll have a stronger case.”

“What if they come looking for us?” Lena asked, her eyes wide with fear.

“We’ll have to be smart about it,” Martin said, determination rising within him. “We can’t let fear control us. We need to take the initiative.”

George stopped pacing and looked at them both. “Okay. Let’s think this through. We need to do some surveillance at that storage facility. If it’s as big as you say, there might be more going on than just the two guys we saw.”

“Agreed,” Martin said. “We can go back during the day when it’s less suspicious. But we need disguises. We can’t be recognized.”

Lena nodded, her confidence growing. “I can grab some clothes from my apartment. We can look like just a couple of people checking out a storage unit.”

“I’ll go with you,” George said. “We can do this.”

Martin felt a rush of gratitude for his friends. They had been thrown into an impossible situation, but instead of breaking apart, they were coming together. 

“Let’s meet back here in an hour,” he said, determination etched on his face. “We’ll figure out our next steps from there.”

As they prepared to leave, Martin felt a shiver of unease. They were stepping into dangerous territory, and the stakes were higher than ever. But they had each other, and they had a plan. That had to be enough.

Lena and George left, and Martin took a moment to collect himself. He knew they were in a precarious situation, but the urgency of their mission pushed him forward. He couldn’t let fear paralyze him, not when they were so close to uncovering the truth. 

As he paced around the apartment, he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched, that danger lurked just out of sight. But there was no turning back now. They were in this together, and he would do whatever it took to protect his friends—and their deli. 

With each passing moment, the city outside continued its restless dance, unaware of the storm brewing within its shadows. The stakes were rising, and Martin knew that the next move would be crucial. They had to act fast before the darkness closed in around them completely.### Chapter 7: The Daylight Shadows

An hour later, Martin paced his apartment, his mind racing with thoughts of what lay ahead. The weight of the evidence they had gathered pressed heavily in his hands, but he felt a flicker of hope. They were about to take control of their fate.

The door creaked open, and George and Lena stepped inside, a mix of excitement and apprehension on their faces. Lena had changed into a loose-fitting hoodie and jeans, her hair pulled back to help disguise her features. George wore a baseball cap pulled low over his brow, giving him an unassuming look.

“Ready?” Martin asked, feeling a surge of determination wash over him.

“Ready as we’ll ever be,” George replied, adjusting his cap. “Let’s do this.”

They made their way back to the storage facility, the sun hanging low in the sky, casting long shadows across the streets. The atmosphere was different in the daylight—less oppressive, but the undercurrent of danger still lingered. Martin glanced around, scanning for any sign of the men from the night before.

As they approached the facility, they spotted a few other people moving about, checking their own storage units. Martin felt a surge of relief. This was their chance to blend in. 

“Let’s act casual,” he instructed, leading the way to the entrance. “We’re just here to check out a unit.”

The door creaked open, and they stepped inside, greeted by the familiar musty smell. They walked down the corridor, staying close but not too obvious. Martin’s heart raced as he neared the unit where they had overheard the conversation.

“Keep an eye out,” he whispered as they approached the door. “I’ll check if it’s open.”

He carefully turned the handle, holding his breath. To his surprise, the door opened with a soft click. Peering inside, he found the room empty, the remnants of the previous night’s chaos still scattered about. The table was bare, but the smell of something lingering in the air hinted that the men had been there recently.

“Looks clear,” Martin said, stepping inside, with George and Lena following closely.

“Let’s see what we can find,” George suggested, glancing around the unit. Martin moved to the table, searching for any clues that might have been overlooked. He noticed a small notebook tucked under a loose board. 

“Here!” he exclaimed, pulling it out. The pages were filled with scribbled notes, names, and what appeared to be coded messages. 

Lena leaned in, her eyes scanning the text. “This could be important. If we can decipher this… it might lead us to someone higher up in this operation.”

“Let’s take it,” Martin said, tucking the notebook into his bag. “We need to keep moving.”

As they were about to exit the unit, Martin heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps in the corridor. His heart raced as he exchanged worried glances with Lena and George.

“Quick!” he hissed, and they ducked behind the door, pressing themselves against the wall.

The footsteps grew louder, and a moment later, the door to the adjacent unit swung open. A man stepped out, his face partially obscured by a baseball cap, but Martin recognized him—the same man who had been arguing inside the unit last night.

“Did you check the shipment?” the man asked someone inside the unit, his voice gruff.

“Yeah, we’re good. Just waiting for the last drop-off,” another voice replied from within.

Martin’s pulse quickened. They had to get out of there before they were spotted. He motioned for George and Lena to stay quiet, holding his breath as the man continued to speak.

“Make sure everything is ready,” the man said. “We can’t afford any mistakes. If anyone asks about the storage units, say we’re just cleaning out old inventory. Understood?”

Martin’s stomach dropped. They were still operating, and they knew how to cover their tracks. This was more dangerous than he had imagined.

The man turned to leave, and Martin felt the tension in the air shift. They needed to act now. As the man stepped away, Martin gestured for his friends to follow him out.

They slipped out of the unit and into the corridor, moving quickly but quietly. They made their way toward the exit, hearts pounding in sync with their footsteps. Just as they reached the door, Martin heard a voice call out from behind them.

“Hey! You there!”

They froze, dread washing over them. It was the man in the baseball cap. 

“Stop!” he shouted, his tone sharp and commanding.

“Run!” Martin yelled, and they bolted through the door, bursting into the sunlight outside. 

They sprinted down the street, adrenaline propelling them forward. The sound of footsteps behind them echoed in their ears as they dashed through the parking lot, weaving between cars. 

“Where do we go?” Lena gasped, glancing over her shoulder.

“Back to my apartment!” Martin shouted, directing them toward a nearby alley. “We can lose him in there!”

They ducked into the alley, the walls closing in around them as they sprinted down the narrow passage. Martin’s mind raced, calculating their next move. They couldn’t let the man catch up to them; they had to find a safe place to regroup and plan their next steps.

As they reached the end of the alley, Martin spotted a small café with outdoor seating just ahead. “In there! We can blend in.”

They dashed inside, quickly finding a corner table where they could catch their breath. Martin glanced around, ensuring no one was watching them too closely, before pulling out the notebook.

“We need to figure out what this means,” he said, flipping through the pages. “There might be clues about who’s running this operation.”

Lena leaned in, her eyes scanning the notes. “If we can decode this, we could get the information we need to take to the police.”

George looked around the café, still on edge. “We need to be careful. If that guy saw us come in, he might come looking.”

“Then let’s act normal,” Martin said, his voice low. “We’ll order something and keep our heads down until we can figure this out.”

As they settled into their seats, Martin felt a mix of fear and determination. They had uncovered dark secrets, but the danger was far from over. They needed to stay one step ahead, and time was running out.### Chapter 8: Decoding Danger

The café bustled with the hum of conversation and the clatter of dishes, a stark contrast to the tension that gripped Martin, Lena, and George. They settled into their corner, each of them hyper-aware of their surroundings. Martin glanced at the notebook, the pages filled with messy handwriting and cryptic notes that could hold the key to exposing the operation they had stumbled upon.

“Let’s order something quick,” Martin suggested, waving a waitress over. “Then we can focus on the notebook.”

As they placed their orders—coffee and pastries—Lena leaned in closer, her brow furrowed in concentration. “Do you think we should try to decode it here? What if someone sees us?”

“We can’t afford to wait,” Martin replied, determination in his voice. “The longer we delay, the more time they have to cover their tracks. We need to act fast.”

George glanced at the entrance, still wary. “Just keep your voices down. If that guy shows up, we’ll need to blend in.”

The waitress returned with their coffee, and they quickly thanked her, then huddled over the notebook. Martin flipped to the first page, his eyes scanning the names and addresses.

“Look at this,” he said, pointing to a name that seemed to appear repeatedly. “This guy—‘Rico Salazar’—he’s mentioned several times, usually next to addresses that look like warehouse locations. I think he might be the one running the operation.”

“Rico Salazar…” Lena murmured, her eyes widening. “I’ve heard that name before—a notorious dealer. If he’s involved, this could be much bigger than we thought.”

George leaned in, studying the notes. “What about this?” He pointed to a series of numbers and letters that seemed out of place. “It looks like a code. Maybe it’s a way to track shipments?”

Martin nodded, excitement building. “If we can figure out the code, it might lead us to where the shipments are going—or even where they’re coming from.”

They all leaned closer, pouring over the notes, trying to piece together the puzzle. The café buzzed around them, but they were in their own world, the urgency of their task overshadowing everything else.

“Here,” Lena said, her finger tracing a line of numbers. “This one looks like it could be a date. And these others… coordinates?”

“Coordinates?” Martin echoed, his interest piqued. “If these are locations, we could find out where they’re operating.”

They worked together, scribbling down potential coordinates and dates, trying to make sense of the mess of information. As they decoded more, a clearer picture began to emerge—locations that seemed to correspond to known warehouses and distribution centers around Los Angeles.

“This is it,” Martin said, excitement bubbling up. “If we can get to one of these locations, we might catch them red-handed.”

But just as the weight of their discovery settled in, the door to the café swung open, and Martin’s heart dropped. He recognized the man in the baseball cap immediately. He stepped inside, scanning the room, and Martin felt time freeze. 

“Stay calm,” he whispered, his voice barely audible. “Act natural.”

The man moved further into the café, his eyes darting from table to table. Martin felt a rush of panic, but he forced himself to focus. They had to keep their composure; revealing their fear could draw unwanted attention.

“Let’s move to the back,” George suggested, his voice steady. “We can stay out of sight.”

They quickly slipped to a table in the far corner of the café, their hearts racing. The man continued to scan the area, lingering for a moment before heading toward the counter.

“Do you think he saw us?” Lena asked, her voice trembling slightly.

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his eyes fixed on the man. “But we need to be ready to leave if he comes this way.”

The man ordered a coffee, his demeanor casual, but Martin could see the tension in his posture. It was clear he was on edge, and that made Martin even more anxious.

“Let’s go over the notes again,” he said, trying to distract them. “We need to stay focused.”

As they huddled over the notebook, Martin felt a sense of urgency. They had to decode the information quickly and get out of the café before the man noticed them. 

“Okay, so if these coordinates lead to a warehouse, we should plan our next move carefully,” he said, his voice low. “We need to figure out how to approach it without drawing attention.”

Lena nodded, her expression intense. “What if we try to follow him? He might lead us to something more.”

George frowned. “That’s risky. If he catches on, we could be in serious trouble.”

“We can’t just sit here,” Martin insisted, glancing at the man, who was now sitting at a table near the window. “If he’s here, he’s not just getting coffee. He’s waiting for something—or someone.”

Lena bit her lip, weighing the options. “If we’re going to follow him, we need to do it discreetly. We can’t draw any attention.”

Just as they were about to make a decision, the man stood up, tossing a few bills on the table before heading toward the door. 

“Now or never,” Martin said, adrenaline surging as they slipped out of their seats, their movements synchronized. 

They followed him outside, keeping their distance but staying close enough to keep him in sight. The man walked briskly down the sidewalk, unaware of the trio trailing him.

“Where do you think he’s going?” George whispered, his eyes focused on the man ahead.

“Only one way to find out,” Martin replied, determination burning in his chest. 

As they followed, the streets began to change. The bustling city atmosphere faded, replaced by a more industrial landscape. They were getting closer to the heart of the operation, and Martin’s instincts kicked in. 

They had to be careful. The stakes were high, and the shadows were growing darker. Whatever lay ahead could either lead them to the truth or into a trap, and they had to stay one step ahead—before it was too late.### Chapter 9: The Chase

Martin, Lena, and George trailed the man through the winding streets, their hearts pounding with a mix of fear and excitement. The industrial landscape morphed as they moved deeper into the heart of Los Angeles, the buildings shifting from commercial to warehouses, their silhouettes looming ominously against the twilight sky.

“Stay close, but don’t let him see us,” Martin instructed, his voice low and steady. The man in the baseball cap picked up his pace, glancing over his shoulder occasionally, and Martin felt a pulse of anxiety. They couldn’t afford to be recognized.

As they rounded a corner, the man stopped in front of a weathered warehouse, its exterior marked with graffiti and peeling paint. He pulled out a key and unlocked the large metal door, slipping inside without a backward glance.

“Now what?” Lena whispered, her breath coming in quick bursts. “Do we go in after him?”

Martin glanced around, ensuring they weren’t being watched. “We need to find a way inside without making a scene. If he’s meeting someone, we might catch them in the act.”

George nodded, scanning the area. “There’s a side entrance over there,” he said, pointing to a smaller door that seemed less conspicuous. “We can check that out.”

They moved quietly to the side entrance, the heavy air thick with anticipation. Martin reached for the handle, testing it gently. It turned, and with a soft creak, the door swung open.

Inside, the warehouse was dimly lit, shafts of light filtering through the dusty windows. The space was cluttered with pallets and boxes, and the air was thick with the scent of metal and oil. They stepped inside cautiously, closing the door behind them.

“Where do we go?” Lena asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“Let’s find a vantage point,” Martin suggested, his eyes scanning the room. “We need to see what’s happening.”

They crept deeper into the warehouse, moving silently among the stacks of crates. Martin felt a rush of adrenaline as they found a shadowy corner that overlooked a clearing in the center of the space.

Peering out, they could see the man from the café standing with two others, both dressed in dark clothing. One of them was tall and muscular, while the other was shorter and leaner, fidgeting nervously.

“Do you have the shipment?” the tall one asked, his voice a low growl.

The man nodded. “It’s all here. We need to move quickly. The heat is on us, and I don’t want any mistakes.”

“Did you deal with the ones snooping around?” the lean one asked, his eyes scanning the shadows.

Martin felt a chill run down his spine. They were talking about them. 

“I’ll handle it,” the man replied, a hint of menace in his voice. “Just focus on getting the product out. We can’t afford any slip-ups.”

Martin exchanged worried glances with Lena and George. They had to act fast; the situation was escalating, and they were in the line of fire.

“Should we call the police?” Lena whispered, her eyes wide with fear.

Martin shook his head. “Not yet. We need more evidence. If we alert them now, we could blow our chance to catch them red-handed.”

As they continued to listen, the conversation shifted to logistics, and Martin’s mind raced. They needed to find a way to gather more information before making their move. 

Suddenly, the door at the other end of the warehouse swung open, and another man stepped inside, looking anxious. He was glancing around nervously, and Martin felt a pang of urgency.

“Is it done?” the newcomer asked, his voice barely above a murmur.

“Not yet,” the tall man replied sharply. “We’re just waiting on the last shipment. We need to keep our heads down until then.”

“Move it faster,” the newcomer insisted. “We can’t wait around. If they find out what we’re doing…”

The tension in the air thickened, and Martin knew they had to make a decision. They were dangerously close to uncovering something big, but they were also at risk of being discovered.

“Let’s split up,” Martin whispered urgently. “George, you stay here and keep an eye on them. Lena and I will check out the back. We need to see if there’s a way to get a closer look at that shipment.”

“Be careful,” George warned, his eyes darting between them and the group. “If they catch you…”

“We will,” Martin assured him, determination flooding his voice. “Just keep us posted.”

With that, Martin and Lena crept away from their hiding spot, moving cautiously toward the rear of the warehouse. They navigated through stacks of boxes, the tension palpable as they tried to avoid making any noise.

As they reached the back, Martin spotted a set of double doors labeled “Loading Dock.” He felt a mixture of excitement and trepidation.

“This could be it,” he said, motioning for Lena to stay low as they approached the doors. “If there’s a shipment coming in or going out, we need to see it.”

They pushed the doors open slightly, peering through the gap. The loading dock was empty, but they could see the faint outline of a truck parked at the far end, its back doors ajar. 

“We’re getting close,” Martin whispered, his pulse quickening. “If we can get a look inside that truck, we might find the evidence we need.”

Lena nodded, her eyes wide with determination. “Let’s do it.”

They slipped through the doors, careful to keep their movements quiet. As they approached the truck, the tension in the air seemed to thrum with danger. They could hear the muffled voices of the men from the main area, but they were focused on their task.

Martin reached the back of the truck and peeked inside. His breath caught in his throat as he saw the boxes stacked high, each one labeled with markings that sent a chill down his spine.

“This is it,” he whispered, pulling out his phone to take pictures. “We need to document everything.”

But just as he began to snap photos, a loud crash echoed from the front of the warehouse. Martin’s heart raced as he heard the commotion—the men were yelling, their voices rising in anger. 

“Someone’s here!” one of them shouted.

Panic surged through Martin as he realized they had been discovered. “We need to go, now!” he hissed, grabbing Lena’s arm.

They turned to flee, but as they moved toward the loading dock doors, they heard footsteps approaching. The tall man from earlier was storming toward them, his expression dark and menacing.

“There they are!” he yelled, pointing directly at Martin and Lena. 

“Run!” Martin shouted, adrenaline surging as they bolted toward the exit. 

They sprinted through the warehouse, dodging crates and boxes as the sounds of pursuit echoed behind them. The tall man’s voice roared through the chaos, urging the others to follow.

“Don’t let them get away!”

They burst through the main entrance, the cool air hitting them like a wave. Martin’s mind raced as they sprinted down the street, the sound of footsteps growing closer. They had to lose them—had to find a way to escape.

“Where do we go?” Lena gasped, glancing back over her shoulder.

“Into the alley!” Martin shouted, spotting a narrow passageway to their right. 

They turned sharply, plunging into the alley as the sounds of pursuit faded slightly. Martin could feel his heart pounding in his chest, every breath a reminder of the danger they were in. 

“Keep moving!” he urged, pushing them forward. “We can’t stop!”

They ran deeper into the maze of alleys, their surroundings becoming a blur. Martin’s mind raced with thoughts of what they had uncovered, but right now, all that mattered was getting to safety.

Finally, they reached a dead end, panting heavily as they pressed against the wall, trying to catch their breath. Martin’s heart pounded in his ears as he listened for the sounds of their pursuers.

“Do you think they followed us?” Lena whispered, her eyes wide with fear.

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his voice tense. “But we can’t stay here. We need to keep moving.”

Just then, a noise echoed from the alley’s entrance, and Martin exchanged a panicked glance with Lena. The men were getting closer.

“Quick, over the fence!” he urged, pointing to a chain-link fence that loomed ahead. 

They scrambled up the fence, adrenaline fueling their movements. As they dropped down on the other side, Martin felt a surge of determination. They had to keep fighting—there was too much at stake.

But as they landed, the reality of their situation hit him. They were deep in a dangerous game, and the odds were not in their favor. They had uncovered a web of crime that reached far beyond what they had imagined, and they needed to stay one step ahead if they were going to survive.

“Let’s keep moving,” Martin said, glancing back toward the alley. “We have to find a safe place to regroup and figure out our next move. This isn’t over yet.” 

With renewed determination, they pushed forward into the night, the shadows of danger trailing closely behind.### Chapter 10: The Final Confrontation

With every step, Martin, Lena, and George felt the weight of the night pressing down on them. They navigated through the maze of alleyways, their breath coming in sharp gasps. The adrenaline that had fueled their escape began to wane, replaced with a sense of urgency. They had to regroup and come up with a plan.

“Where do we go now?” Lena asked, glancing over her shoulder as they reached a quieter street. 

“We need to get off the main roads,” Martin replied, scanning their surroundings. “There’s a coffee shop a few blocks from here. We can lay low for a bit and figure out our next move.”

They hurried toward the coffee shop, a small, unassuming place that was still open despite the late hour. As they entered, the warmth and familiar smell of coffee enveloped them, offering a brief sanctuary from the chaos outside. 

They found a corner table, their eyes darting around the shop as they tried to blend in. George ordered three coffees while Martin pulled out his phone, checking for any updates. He felt a knot of anxiety in his stomach—time was running out, and they needed to act fast.

“Okay, we have the notebook with the names and addresses,” George said, leaning in. “But we still don’t know how to connect the dots. We need to find a way to get this information to the police without putting ourselves in danger.”

Lena nodded, taking a sip of her coffee. “What if we can set a trap? We could gather more evidence, then tip off the police about a shipment.”

Martin’s mind raced as he considered the idea. “That could work. If we can figure out when the next shipment is coming in, we could be there to catch them in the act.”

“But how do we find that out?” George asked, his brow furrowed in thought.

Martin opened the notebook and began flipping through the pages, looking for any clues that might lead them to the next shipment. “There has to be something in here,” he murmured, his eyes scanning the coded notes.

Just then, Lena pointed to one of the addresses. “What about this one? It’s marked for tomorrow. It could be a delivery point.”

Martin’s heart raced as he examined the address. “That’s a warehouse on the outskirts of town. If we can confirm that it’s a delivery point, we could set up a meeting with the police.”

“Let’s do it,” George said, determination flashing in his eyes. “But we need to be careful. If they catch wind of what we’re doing, it could put us all in danger.”

They finalized their plan, deciding to head to the warehouse at dawn. They would scout the area, take note of any activity, and then contact the police with the evidence they had gathered. 

As they finished their coffees, Martin felt a sense of purpose wash over him. This was their chance to bring down the operation and stop the men behind it once and for all. But as they stepped back into the night, a shadow loomed over their newfound resolve.

“Stay close,” he instructed as they exited. “We can’t let our guard down.”

They made their way toward the warehouse, taking back alleys and side streets to avoid drawing attention. The streets were quieter now, the city beginning to settle into the early hours of the morning. 

As they approached the warehouse, Martin felt a mix of anxiety and determination. The structure loomed ahead, its darkened windows seeming to watch them as they moved closer. 

“Let’s hide behind those crates,” George suggested, pointing to a pile of shipping containers stacked nearby. They crouched behind the containers, their hearts racing as they waited for signs of activity.

Minutes stretched into what felt like hours. Just as doubt began to creep in, the sound of engines echoed in the distance. Martin’s breath caught in his throat as a truck pulled into the loading area, its headlights cutting through the darkness.

“Here we go,” he whispered, adrenaline surging through him. 

They watched as men emerged from the truck, unloading boxes that matched the markings they had seen in the notebook. Martin’s heart raced as he pulled out his phone, documenting everything.

“Call the police,” he urged George, who quickly dialed the number. 

As George spoke to the dispatcher, Martin and Lena continued to watch, trying to keep track of every detail. The men worked quickly, their movements practiced and efficient. 

“Stay hidden,” Martin whispered, his eyes locked on the scene. “We can’t risk being seen.”

But just as the police operator assured George that help was on the way, the tall man from the café stepped out of the shadows, his eyes scanning the area. 

“Someone’s here!” he shouted, his voice echoing through the warehouse. 

Panic surged through Martin as he realized they had been spotted. “We need to move!” he hissed, grabbing Lena’s arm.

They darted away from the crates, hearts pounding as they sprinted toward the nearest exit. The sounds of chaos erupted behind them as the men shouted and the truck's engine roared to life.

“Go! Go!” Martin urged as they fled through the back entrance of the warehouse, sprinting into the cover of darkness. 

They dashed through the maze of crates and equipment, adrenaline pushing them forward. Martin could hear the men shouting behind them, their footsteps growing louder.

“We can’t let them catch us!” Lena cried, her voice filled with panic.

“Keep running!” Martin shouted, leading them toward a side alley that would take them away from the warehouse.

As they reached the alley, the sounds of pursuit faded slightly, but Martin knew they couldn’t stop. They had to reach safety and ensure that the police arrived. 

“Let’s find a place to hide,” George suggested, glancing back toward the warehouse. “We need to regroup.”

They ducked behind a large dumpster, catching their breath as they listened for any signs of their pursuers. The adrenaline began to wear off, replaced by a rush of anxiety. 

“We can’t stay here long,” Martin said, his mind racing. “The police should be arriving any minute, but we need to be ready.”

As they waited, they could hear the sounds of sirens in the distance. Relief washed over Martin, but the danger was still very real. They had exposed themselves, and the men would be looking for them.

“Stay close,” Martin instructed, determination flooding his voice. “We’ll wait for the police and make sure they know what’s happening.”

Just then, the sound of footsteps echoed through the alley, and Martin’s heart dropped. A group of men rounded the corner, their faces twisted with anger. 

“There they are!” the tall man shouted, pointing directly at them.

“Run!” Martin yelled, pushing Lena and George ahead as they bolted from their hiding spot. 

They sprinted down the alley, the sound of their pursuers growing closer. The sirens were louder now, but they needed to buy time for help to arrive. 

As they reached the end of the alley, Martin spotted a narrow street leading toward the main road. “This way!” he shouted, leading them to safety.

They dashed through the street, adrenaline pounding in their veins. Just as they reached the intersection, police cars came into view, lights flashing and sirens blaring. 

“Over here!” Martin yelled, waving his arms to get the officers’ attention. 

The police cars screeched to a halt, and officers jumped out, weapons drawn as they assessed the scene. 

“Get down! Get down!” one of the officers shouted as they rushed toward Martin and his friends.

“They’re after us!” Lena gasped, pointing back toward the alley.

“Stay behind us!” an officer commanded, leading them to safety as they prepared to confront the men pursuing them.

Martin felt a mix of relief and fear as the officers moved to secure the area. The tension hung thick in the air as they awaited the confrontation.

The men from the warehouse emerged from the alley, but as they saw the police, their expressions shifted from anger to panic. 

“Run!” the tall man shouted, turning to flee.

But the officers were quick, blocking the escape routes and surrounding the men. 

“Freeze! You’re under arrest!” one officer shouted, his voice steady and authoritative.

As the officers moved in, Martin felt a sense of triumph wash over him. They had done it—they had exposed the operation and brought the criminals to justice. 

George, still catching his breath, turned to Martin. “We did it. We really did it.”

Lena nodded, her eyes wide with disbelief. “I can’t believe we made it out alive.”

As the police secured the area and began to question the arrested men, Martin felt the weight of the night finally begin to lift. They had faced danger together, and they had come out on the other side.

“Let’s make sure they know everything,” Martin said, determination flooding his voice. “We need to give them all the evidence we have.”

As they moved forward, the first light of dawn began to break over the horizon, casting a warm glow across the city. The shadows that had loomed over them had begun to recede, and as they stepped into the light, they knew they had emerged victorious.

Together, they had faced the darkness, and together, they had found their way into the light. The deli, their lives, and the city were safe once again, and as Martin looked at his friends, he knew they had forged an unbreakable bond in the process.

“Let’s head home,” he said, a smile breaking through the tension. “We have a deli to run.” 

And as the sun rose over the city, they walked into a new day, ready to embrace whatever came next.",1,1736770257.0,ebooklibri,0,1.0,False

So much redpill abuse it couldn't be modded and it shut down.

There was a narrative that it was all 'yeah, here's how to get a tall rich man!!1!'

But it really, really wasn't.

The advice was things like
(1) How to spot love bombing, & understand it's a yellow flag. (yes, 'he filled my hotel room with flowers' could be a Grand Gesture, but girl, keep your eves open).

(2) Don't make yourself available for last minute booty calls. You're unlikely to find someone who loves and cherishes you like that. Yes, some people find the love of their life that way, but statistically, it's a pump and dump.

(3) Block and delete at the first sign of disrespect. Either they're trying to see how much they can get away with or else they are just disrespectful.

(4) You can leave for any reason. 

(5) Be self sufficient. Always have your OWN transport to the date. Have your own bank account in a relationship. Earn enough to support yourself without his income.

(6) Safety tips like, don't get picked up at home and don't let new people know your home address. Tell people where you are going and schedule a check in call so he knows people know.

(X) Number x because I'm too lazy to renumber. Never move in together before 18 months. Most people can keep up a nice guy mask for a maximum of 18 months. If something happens before then apply the 'block and delete' rule. There's no rush if you really are meant to be together.

The two controversial ones were 

(7) Don't have sex within the first three months. You don't tell them a deadline. You just say you want to take it slow. That way, you're not in a stranger, alone and vulnerable. You're not in his house, vulnerable. He doesn't know where you live. The pump and dump people would lose interest by then, usually.

The most controversial one.

(8)For the FIRST date HE should invite you for a proper sit down date that HE pays for. Do not accept a coffee date, walking date, free activity date.

Reasoning: Men devalue women who chase after them. Yes, your aunt Jen has a happy story about that, but as a group, brought up in a western and most cultures, that's just the way it is, even if you don't like it. 

Why a sit down meal that he pays for? The he pays is partly because you are invited by HIM. You express your interest in guys who you like, but after that, let THEM initiate a date or move on. And if they've invited you, they pay.
And they pay so that you avoid the people playing a numbers game. Online dating is like an endless buffet, some people there are compelled to constantly keep their opinions open and have multiple free dates with women. You will weed out unserious people, because most can't afford to be taking people out to dinner all the time unless they are actually genuinely interested.

They also say this is the peak of his intrigue, if he doesn't value you more than a free walk on the beach, he's not interested enough. And for a long term partner, you need to adore each other.

The consensus is that most people won't find someone who meets all those standards but better to be alone than with someone who doesn't adore you.",0,1736770228.0,self,2,0.5,False

The neon sign outside read ""Martin's Deli,"" a bright beacon against the fading twilight of Los Angeles. The smell of grilled meats and melted cheese wafted through the air, mingling with the faint hint of the Pacific breeze. Inside, the small paninoteca was bustling with the usual evening crowd—locals grabbing a quick bite after work, friends catching up over sandwiches, and the occasional late-night wanderer lured by the savory aromas.

Martin, the owner and head chef, was behind the counter, his hands deftly assembling a towering panino, layers of prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and arugula spilling out from between the toasted ciabatta. His face was a mix of concentration and joy; he loved this place, this rhythm of service, and the community it fostered. 

George, his right-hand man, was busy at the grill, flipping patties and checking on the fries, his laughter ringing out as he joked with the customers. The two men had been friends since childhood, their bond forged in the kitchens of their mothers and the streets of their neighborhood.

Lena, the newest addition to the team, was sweeping the floor, her eyes darting around as she took in the lively atmosphere. She had recently moved to LA, chasing dreams of stardom but finding herself drawn to the warmth of the deli. There was something about the place that felt like home, even if it was just a temporary stop on her journey.

As the dinner rush began to settle, Martin wiped his brow and turned to George. “Hey, did you see the guy who came in earlier? The one in the leather jacket?” 

George shrugged, flipping a burger. “Yeah, he seemed a little off. Why?”

“He ordered a sandwich and paid in cash, but he kept looking over his shoulder. I don’t like the vibe.”

Lena, overhearing their conversation, leaned in. “Should we be concerned? It’s a deli, not a crime scene.”

Martin chuckled but his expression was serious. “In this city, you never know. Just keep an eye out, okay?”

As the night wore on, the crowd began to thin, and the familiar sounds of the grill and the chatter of the few remaining customers filled the air. But just as Martin was about to close up for the night, the door swung open with a clang, and in walked the man in the leather jacket.

His presence was commanding, and the laughter in the deli quieted as he scanned the room. Martin felt a chill run down his spine. The man approached the counter, his eyes narrowing as they locked onto Martin’s.

“I need to talk to you,” the man said, his voice low and gravelly.

“Sorry, we’re closing,” Martin replied, trying to keep his tone steady.

The man leaned in closer, his breath heavy with the scent of cigarette smoke. “This isn’t a request.”

Before Martin could respond, George stepped forward, a protective stance taking over. “Hey, buddy, you need to back off.”

The man’s gaze shifted to George, and for a moment, the tension in the room crackled like static electricity. Lena stood frozen, her heart racing, sensing that something was about to unfold.

“Just a simple conversation,” the man said, his smile not reaching his eyes. “You know something you shouldn’t.”

Martin’s mind raced. What did this man know? And why did he feel like this was just the beginning of something much darker?

As the clock ticked towards midnight, the city outside buzzed with life, unaware of the storm brewing within the walls of Martin’s Deli. Secrets simmered beneath the surface, and in a city where dreams and nightmares often collided, this was one meal that was about to turn sour.### Chapter 2: Unraveling Threads

The tension in the deli thickened like the steam rising from the grill. Martin’s heart raced as he tried to gauge the man’s intentions. He could feel George’s protective energy beside him, but the uncertainty of the situation gnawed at him.

“Look, I don’t know what you think you know,” Martin said, keeping his voice steady. “But this is just a sandwich shop. We don’t want any trouble.”

The man chuckled, a low, menacing sound that sent a shiver down Lena’s spine. “Oh, but you’re mistaken, my friend. This isn’t just a sandwich shop. It’s a crossroads. And you, Martin, are at the center of it.”

George stepped forward, his fists clenched. “You need to leave. Now.”

The man’s eyes flicked to George, assessing, then returned to Martin. “You’re smarter than you look. I respect that. But you’re in way over your head. I’m giving you a chance to come clean.”

Martin exchanged a glance with George, who nodded slightly. They had been through a lot together, but this felt different. He was about to respond when Lena, unable to contain her curiosity any longer, spoke up.

“Why don’t you tell us what you’re talking about?” she asked, her voice shaking but defiant. “What do you want with Martin?”

The man turned to her, his expression softening momentarily, as if he hadn’t expected her to speak. “You’re brave, I’ll give you that. But bravery can be a dangerous game in this city.”

“Enough with the riddles,” George said, his voice firm. “What do you want?”

The man leaned closer, lowering his voice. “I want to know where the packages went.”

Martin’s stomach dropped. He had heard whispers about shipments and deals, but he never thought they would touch his little deli. “What packages?” he asked, feigning ignorance even as fear coursed through him.

“Don’t play dumb with me,” the man hissed. “I know you’re involved. You’ve been acting as a front, haven’t you? It’s clever, using a deli to mask the real business. But it’s time to choose a side.”

Lena’s eyes widened. “What are you talking about? We don’t know anything about any business!”

“Maybe not yet,” the man said, straightening up. “But you’re in this deeper than you realize. Just remember, Martin, I’ll be watching. And if you want to stay out of trouble, you should think about what I said.”

With that, the man turned on his heel and strode out of the deli, the door slamming shut behind him. The three of them stood in a stunned silence, the weight of what had just transpired settling heavily in the air.

“What the hell was that?” George finally exclaimed, his voice rising in disbelief. “Packages? What does he mean?”

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his mind racing as he tried to piece together the fragments of the encounter. “But we need to figure this out. We can’t let this guy think we’re involved in something we’re not.”

Lena, still shaken, spoke up. “What if he’s right? What if we are in over our heads? This isn’t just about sandwiches anymore.”

Martin took a deep breath, his resolve hardening. “We’ll find out what’s really going on. We need to dig deeper. If there’s something hidden here, we can’t just sit back and let it come to us.”

George nodded, his expression serious. “So what’s our first step?”

Martin glanced around the deli, feeling the weight of the walls closing in. “We need to check the back storage area. If there’s anything suspicious, that’s where it will be. And we need to do it now, before he comes back.”

The three of them moved cautiously toward the back of the deli, adrenaline coursing through their veins. As they approached the storage area, Martin felt a mix of determination and dread. Whatever secrets lay hidden in the shadows of Martin’s Deli were about to be uncovered, and there was no turning back now.

They pushed open the door to the storage room, the flickering fluorescent lights casting eerie shadows on the shelves stacked high with supplies. But as they stepped inside, a sense of foreboding filled the air. It was time to confront the truth, no matter how dangerous it might be.### Chapter 3: Shadows in the Back

The storage room was dimly lit, the fluorescent lights buzzing like angry bees overhead. Shelves lined the walls, crammed with boxes of bread, bags of flour, and jars of condiments. But as Martin scanned the space, his eyes landed on a corner that felt out of place—an area shrouded in darkness, tucked away behind a stack of crates.

“Over there,” Martin whispered, pointing towards the shadows. George and Lena exchanged nervous glances but nodded, their collective instincts urging them forward.

As they approached, Martin’s heart raced. What were they about to uncover? He reached for the nearest crate and began to move it aside, revealing a small door that had been partially hidden from view. Its surface was worn, and the handle was cold to the touch.

“Is this even part of the deli?” Lena asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his curiosity piqued. “But it’s time we find out.”

With a deep breath, he turned the handle and pushed the door open. It creaked ominously, revealing a narrow staircase leading down into darkness. The air was musty, and the sound of dripping water echoed from below.

“Should we really go down there?” George asked, hesitating at the top of the stairs.

“We have to,” Martin said firmly. “If there’s something happening here that we don’t know about, we need to uncover it. For our safety—and for the deli.”

Lena nodded, determination flickering in her eyes. “Let’s do it.”

With George leading the way, the three of them descended the staircase, each step heavy with anticipation. The air grew cooler, and the faint light from above quickly faded, leaving them in near darkness. Martin pulled out his phone, using the flashlight to illuminate their path as they reached the bottom.

They found themselves in a small, dimly lit basement. The space was cluttered with old equipment, discarded boxes, and a few crates that looked newer than the rest. But what caught Martin's eye was a large table in the center of the room, covered with documents and scattered items.

“What is all this?” George asked, stepping closer to the table. 

Martin moved to the table, his mind racing as he scanned the papers. Some were invoices, while others seemed to be shipping documents. His stomach sank as he read a few familiar names—names associated with less than reputable dealings in Los Angeles.

“Looks like a distribution list,” he murmured, his voice thick with disbelief. “And these… these are addresses. They’re not just sandwiches being shipped out of here.”

Lena leaned over, her eyes wide. “Martin, this is serious. What if he’s right? What if we’ve been unknowingly involved in something illegal?”

Before Martin could respond, a noise echoed from above—the unmistakable sound of footsteps. George’s eyes widened in alarm. “We need to get out of here. Now.”

They quickly moved to the staircase, but Martin hesitated. “Wait! We can’t just leave this behind. We need proof.”

“Proof of what?” George hissed, glancing nervously at the stairs. “That we’ve got a secret drug operation in our deli? Are you crazy?”

“Just give me a minute,” Martin replied, rummaging through the papers. He grabbed a few documents, focusing on the addresses and names that seemed most relevant. 

Lena, glancing back toward the staircase, said, “Hurry! We can’t stay here.”

Just as Martin stuffed the papers into his bag, the footsteps grew louder, and a shadow fell across the top of the stairs. Panic surged through him. They had to act quickly.

“Go!” he shouted, and they scrambled back up the stairs, adrenaline pushing them forward.

As they burst into the storage room, Martin's heart sank. The front door swung open, and in stepped the man in the leather jacket, flanked by two others. The atmosphere shifted instantly, the air charged with danger.

“Thought you could hide from me?” the man sneered, his eyes glinting with malice. “You should’ve stayed away from things that don’t concern you.”

George moved to shield Lena, but Martin stepped forward, defiance fueling his voice. “You don’t know what we’ve found. We’re not afraid of you.”

The man laughed, a hollow sound that echoed in the small space. “Brave words for someone who’s already in over his head. You have no idea who you’re dealing with.”

Lena, trembling but resolute, whispered to Martin, “What do we do?”

In that moment, Martin felt a mix of fear and determination. They had uncovered something dangerous, and now it was time to confront it head-on. “We fight for our deli. We fight for our lives.”

With a swift movement, Martin grabbed a nearby crate and hurled it toward the man, hoping to create a distraction. Chaos erupted as the crate crashed to the ground, sending papers flying and the group scattering.

“Run!” Martin shouted, and the three of them dashed for the exit, adrenaline pumping through their veins as they raced against time and the danger closing in around them. 

The deli was their sanctuary, but now it felt like a battleground. The stakes had never been higher, and the shadows of their past were catching up to them. If they wanted to survive, they had to uncover the truth—before it was too late.### Chapter 4: Into the Fray

They burst through the front door of Martin’s Deli, the cool night air hitting their faces like a splash of cold water. Martin glanced back at the deli, heart pounding. The man in the leather jacket and his accomplices were still inside, but they didn’t have time to think about that now. They had to get somewhere safe.

“Where do we go?” Lena asked, her voice trembling as they ran down the street, the neon lights of the deli flickering behind them.

“Back to my apartment,” Martin replied, urgency lacing his words. “It’s not far, and it’ll give us a place to regroup.”

George nodded, keeping an eye on the street behind them. “Let’s move. We can’t let them catch up.”

They sprinted down the sidewalk, the familiar sights of Los Angeles blurring past them. The streets were alive with the sounds of cars honking and distant music, but all Martin could hear was the pounding of his heart and the realization that their lives had just taken a turn into darkness.

As they turned a corner, Martin led them into an alley. The shadows felt suffocating, but it was better than being out in the open. They slowed, catching their breath, and Martin pulled out his phone.

“Do you think we should call the police?” Lena asked, her eyes wide with fear.

“Not yet,” Martin replied, glancing at George. “If we go to the cops now, they might think we’re involved. We need to figure out what’s really going on first.”

George leaned against the wall, trying to catch his breath. “So what’s our plan? We can’t just sit here and wait.”

“I need to look at those documents again,” Martin said, determination setting in. “There might be something we can use. If we can find out who’s behind this, we can make a case. But we need to be careful.”

“Agreed,” George said, standing up straighter. “Let’s get to your apartment and figure this out.”

They emerged from the alley and made their way to Martin’s apartment, a small unit on the second floor of an old building. As they climbed the stairs, anxiety clawed at Martin’s insides. What if the man in the leather jacket had followed them? What if they were walking straight into a trap?

Once inside, Martin locked the door and pulled the curtains shut. The dim light from a single bulb illuminated the cramped space filled with mismatched furniture and the lingering scent of stale coffee. They huddled around the small table, the papers from the storage room spread out before them.

“Okay, let’s see what we’ve got,” Martin said, his fingers trembling slightly as he sifted through the documents. “We need to find anything that can help us identify who’s behind this.”

Lena leaned in, scanning the papers. “These addresses… they look like they’re spread all over the city. What if these are just drop points?”

“Exactly,” Martin replied, piecing together the puzzle. “If we can connect these addresses to a bigger operation, we might be able to figure out who’s running it.”

George flipped through the documents, his brow furrowed in concentration. “What about this one?” He pointed at a name listed on an invoice. “This guy has a reputation. I’ve heard whispers about him in the neighborhood—deals gone bad, people disappearing.”

Lena looked up, her face pale. “You mean he’s dangerous?”

“Very,” George confirmed, his voice serious. “If he’s involved, we’re in deeper trouble than we thought.”

Martin’s mind raced. They needed to act fast. “We can’t let this go. If we report this to the right people, we might be able to expose whatever’s happening. But we need evidence—something solid.”

“Then we should check out one of these addresses,” George suggested. “See if we can gather more information.”

Lena hesitated. “But what if they’re watching? What if they know we’re onto them?”

“Then we have to be smart about it,” Martin said, determination burning in his chest. “We move quickly and quietly. We can split up to cover more ground.”

George nodded. “I’ll take one of the addresses. It looks like a warehouse. You two can check out the other one—it’s a small storage facility.”

Lena bit her lip. “What if something goes wrong?”

Martin met her gaze, his expression firm. “We have to be brave. We can’t let fear control us. We’ll stick to our phones and check in regularly. If anything feels off, we bail. Agreed?”

“Agreed,” George and Lena said in unison, a newfound sense of resolve settling over them.

As they gathered their things, Martin felt a rush of adrenaline. They were stepping into the unknown, but they were also taking control of their lives again. Whatever shadows lurked in the city tonight, they wouldn’t face them alone.

With one last look around the apartment, Martin led the way out, locking the door behind them. The night was waiting, and the answers they sought were just beyond the darkness. They were about to plunge deeper into a world of secrets and danger, and there was no turning back now.### Chapter 5: The Warehouse

The streets of Los Angeles pulsed with life, but for Martin, Lena, and George, the vibrant city felt like a backdrop to a dark film. As they moved towards their separate destinations, the weight of their mission hung heavily on their shoulders. Each step felt like a step into the unknown, and the thrill of danger coursed through their veins.

Martin and Lena arrived at a nondescript storage facility nestled between two larger buildings. The exterior was unremarkable—gray concrete, rusting metal doors, and a flickering overhead light that gave off a dull glow. Martin felt a knot tighten in his stomach. This was it. They were about to confront something that could change their lives forever.

“Are you ready?” Martin asked, glancing at Lena, who was taking deep breaths to steady her nerves.

“As ready as I’ll ever be,” she replied, her voice steadying. “Let’s just be careful.”

They approached the entrance, a large metal door that seemed to loom over them. Martin pulled out his phone to check the time; it was just after 10 PM. The facility was quiet, save for the distant hum of traffic. He glanced around, making sure no one was watching. 

“Okay, let’s see if it’s unlocked,” he said, testing the door handle. To his surprise, it turned easily, and the door creaked open. 

Inside, the air was stale, thick with dust and the faint scent of industrial cleaner. Martin turned on his phone’s flashlight, illuminating a narrow corridor lined with storage units. The walls were adorned with peeling paint and faded signage. 

“This place gives me the creeps,” Lena whispered, her voice echoing slightly in the silence. “Are you sure we should be here?”

“We need to find out what’s happening,” Martin replied, resolve hardening his voice. “We can’t turn back now.” 

They moved cautiously down the corridor, the beam of light from Martin’s phone cutting through the darkness. They paused at the first unit, marked with a faded number. Martin hesitated, then gently pulled the door open. It screeched on its hinges, and they both flinched.

Inside, the unit was empty, save for a few scattered boxes and a thick layer of dust. “Nothing here,” Martin muttered, his heart sinking. 

They continued down the row, checking each unit. Most were empty or filled with old furniture, but as they reached the end of the corridor, a faint sound caught Martin's attention—a muffled conversation coming from somewhere deeper within the facility.

“Did you hear that?” he whispered to Lena. She nodded, her eyes wide with fear.

“Let’s go check it out,” Martin said, his heart racing. They crept toward the source of the sound, which seemed to be coming from a larger unit at the far end.

As they approached, Martin could make out distinct voices—two men arguing heatedly. He pressed his ear against the door, straining to catch snippets of the conversation.

“...told you it was a bad idea!” one voice hissed, filled with frustration. “Now they’re onto us!”

“We can handle it. We just need to keep the shipments moving,” the other replied, calmer but with an underlying edge of menace. “We can’t let anyone find out.”

Martin exchanged a glance with Lena. They needed to know more, but how? 

“Should we go in?” Lena whispered, her voice barely audible.

“No,” Martin replied, his mind racing. “We need to find out what they’re planning without getting caught. Let’s see if we can find a way to listen in without being seen.”

They stepped back and scanned the corridor for any other openings. Martin spotted a small window near the top of the unit’s wall. “If we can climb up and look through, we might be able to see what’s happening inside.”

“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Lena asked, concern etched on her face. “What if they see us?”

“We’ll be quick,” Martin assured her. “We need this information.”

Together, they managed to find a stack of old crates nearby, using them to climb up to the window. Martin hoisted himself up first, peering through the grimy glass. The view inside was partially obscured, but he could make out the two men standing beside a table cluttered with packages.

“Look!” Martin whispered urgently, signaling for Lena to join him.

She climbed up next to him, her breath hitching as she focused on the scene inside. The two men were now rifling through boxes, pulling out neatly packed bags that glimmered under the dim light.

“Is that…?” Lena began, but Martin nodded, understanding her unspoken words. It was what they had feared—drugs, being processed and prepared for distribution.

“Looks like we were right,” Martin murmured, his heart pounding. “This is a major operation.”

As they continued to watch, one of the men pulled out a phone and spoke into it, his tone urgent. “We need to move the product tonight. I don’t care what it takes. If anyone gets in our way, deal with them. We can’t afford any mistakes.”

Lena’s eyes widened in horror. “Did you hear that? They’re not just dealing drugs; they’re threatening people!”

Martin felt a surge of adrenaline and fear. “We need to get this evidence back to George and figure out our next move. But we have to be careful. If they see us leaving…”

Before he could finish, the door to the unit swung open, and one of the men stepped out, glancing around suspiciously. Martin and Lena froze, hearts racing as they pressed themselves against the wall, barely breathing.

The man took a few steps down the corridor, scanning the area. “What was that?” he muttered to himself, his eyes narrowing.

Lena’s grip tightened around Martin’s arm, and he could feel the tension in the air. They had to act fast.

“Let’s go,” he whispered urgently, and they scrambled down from the crates, hearts pounding in sync with their footsteps as they moved quickly but quietly back toward the entrance.

They could feel the weight of danger closing in around them, and as they reached the door, Martin glanced back, knowing this was just the beginning. They had uncovered something monumental, but now they had to get out alive—and fast.",1,1736770131.0,ebooklibri,0,1.0,False
1i0cik5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i0cik5,Murakami pop-up in Singapore ,"I recently visited the Louis Vuitton x Takashi Murakami pop-up in Singapore, housed in a charming heritage shophouse at 72 Joo Chiat Place. Despite the intimate setting, the pop-up is thoughtfully divided into four distinct areas: a retail space showcasing the vibrant collection, a care station for repairs, a cozy cinema screening Murakami’s remastered Superflat films, and a quaint café offering specialty drinks like the coconut latte. ￼

Many items were out of stock, but orders could be placed for accessories and small leather goods, with an estimated waiting period of 4 to 6 weeks. I had my heart set on the powder blue Alma; unfortunately, it was unavailable, and nothing else particularly caught my eye. 

Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the beautifully curated collection and immersing myself in the unique blend of art and fashion that the pop-up offered. 🫶🫶",2,1736770100.0,Louisvuitton,0,1.0,False

My general dr is a really good friend of mine / mentor to me so we meet monthly at a local coffee shop and I have had every test under the sun done and he assures me i am one of the healthiest people he knows. I am an athletic 37 yr old male with no problem. I dont drink. I am just a lifelong anxiety sufferer who started having panic attacks at 30 and got stuck in the dreaded cycle of fearing having ectopic heart beats, hating them and having anxiety about them, then getting more ectopics. What a terrible cycle as you all know. Can be damn near impossible to get out of. While i feel like i have made great growth, I still “fear” a certain type of heart rhythm disturbance. Everyone knows the typical flutter, pause, big beat. Those i used to get about 10 a day, (now i only a couple a week whic are mostly posture related… me laying on couch after eating. If i start getting them, they would stop until i switch positions) because i am able to rationalize that these are just a part of being a human being, and my bodies response to anxiety NOT my heart having an issue. Now, here is my question…

Sometimes, I get a difference sensation where my heart feels like it quivers quickly for 3-5 seconds and then goes back to normal. I HATE these… i dont have any lightheadedness or anything with them. I tell my dr about this and he basically says, “ur anxious, ur healthy”. Now id say i get this particular weird quiver about 2-3 times a year. This most recent time happened after ive had a cold/maybe flu for three days. I was very anxious earlier before the epidode because of my persistent body aches. Just randomly starting quivering on the couch at 11:55pm before bed. 

There is no way im wearing a holter monitor for a year to try and catch that quiver. What does that 5 second out of whack disturbance sound like? I really dont want it to be afib which is my greatest fear. Is it possible to have random 5 second afib 2-3 times a year? Or is this just another strange variation of ectopics? Anyone else get these random 3-5 second quivers? Is afib something you “have” or can anyone with anxiety experience a quick run of afib, but not actually have it? Does that make sense? Kind of the like the blood pressure thing… its possible to have high blood pressure at times, but that doesnt mean you “have” hypertension.

This may seem like a dumb question but I cannot decide at all. We’ve never had any animosity towards each other and have stayed as friends, albeit ones that don’t talk to each other anymore. Since breaking up I’ve realized what else I could’ve done in the relationship, the love was there but there was plenty that I didn’t do or was bad at. The first time we saw each other after breaking up she joined me for a concert which afterward I may pushed things and read her a letter I wrote but she ended up saying it was the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to her. Just to show you there’s no ill-will with us. 
For context: she was my first girlfriend, really first everything, we broke up in March of 23 (she broke up with me) but since then we’ve seen each other twice and have kept in touch via snap or text off and on more than a few times. It was pretty much always her (besides one time, the first time I saw her after breaking up) that would initiate the convos after we haven’t been talking for a while. 

Our last interaction started last May where she messaged me out of nowhere asking me to come to her college graduation. She said things like she really wants to talk but know she doesn’t deserve to. Looking back I was probably a little too quick to agree but I tried my best in that time to not sound so eager about going. As the time was coming up she would say things like how excited she was about the weekend and just things in my eyes that made it seem like good things could come out of this visit. But then the week of graduation came around and I’d ask if she was really sure about me coming up and then the weekend came and she pushed me coming back a day due to her family being there. I never ended up going. I questioned why and the answer I got imo was pretty pathetic. She said that she was drunk and in her feels when she first messaged me about coming but then decided to snap me for almost a month until your graduation and then say multiple times you’re excited?? I asked her why she couldn’t say that like the next day or shortly after asking me and I didn’t get a good answer on. Because that would make too much sense right? Instead of basically leading someone on about something happening. Pump faked hard. 

Not that I thought it would get us back together as both of our personal plans were to move states at the end of summer. Which I did but she did not. Being across the country from home has taught me some things which is part of the reason I want to reach out to her and I think her bday is a good opportunity. She has a new boyfriend though which is kinda making me think I should just leave her alone. But we’ve always said we’ll remain friends. I was gonna ask if she wanted to meet up for coffee when I’m back in her state but now that she has a bf I don’t think that is smart or would happen. And it’s not like I’m going to pour my heart out to her. Just happy birthday and tell her I still appreciate her. Idk what to do, I still care about her. 

Long ass jumbled post for just wondering if I tell her hbd but it’s not an easy decision for me. Ask any questions below or in my dms, thanks.

The Science Behind Banana Peels and Teeth Whitening

How Banana Peels Work Their Whitening Magic

Banana peels aren't just a tasty snack leftovers – they're packed with incredible properties that can potentially transform your dental care routine. The secret lies in the peel's rich mineral content, particularly **potassium, magnesium, and manganese**. These minerals work together to help remove surface stains and potentially strengthen tooth enamel.

Key Benefits of Using Banana Peels for Teeth Whitening:
- Natural and chemical-free approach
- Cost-effective alternative to professional whitening
- Potentially reduces tooth sensitivity
- Provides essential minerals to tooth enamel

The Mineral Breakdown: Why Banana Peels Are Effective

Potassium: Helps remineralize tooth enamel
Magnesium: Supports overall tooth health
Manganese: Contributes to bone mineral density

Scientifically Speaking: The Whitening Mechanism

Research suggests that the minerals in banana peels can help create a **protective barrier on tooth enamel**. This barrier potentially blocks stain-causing compounds from adhering to your teeth, resulting in a naturally brighter smile. While more comprehensive studies are needed, initial findings are promising.

was looking up some references to prove he was right.
MARCH: Had a busy day first of the month. My owner was elected president of
the PTA & used me to prepare a speech.
APRIL: Grandpa visited us this month. He kept me on his lap for an hour reading
I Cor 13. He seems to think more of me than do some people in my own
household.

in my pages.
JUNE: I look like a scrapbook. They have stuffed me full of newspaper clippings -
one of the girls was married.

could stay home; I know I'll be closed up in this thing for at least two weeks.
AUGUST: Still in the suitcase.
SEPTEMBER: Back home at last and in my old familiar place. I have a lot of
company. Two women's magazines and four comic books are stacked on top of
me. I wish I could be read as much as they are.
OCTOBER: They read me a little bit today. One of them is very sick. Right now I
am sitting in the center of the coffee table. I think the Pastor is coming by for a
visit.
NOVEMBER: Back in my old place. Somebody asked today if I were a

We were inseparable as kids and stayed close as we got older. We went to the same university, though we had different majors, and we roomed together with three other people in a rented house. Max and I are still close, but we are not “best friends forever” close anymore. Max is actually best friends with my husband, Daniel. They met when I started dating Daniel in university, and he would come over to our house. Over time, Max and Daniel became a lot closer than Max and I are now. Max and I still talk and hang out sometimes, but we are not each other’s go-to people for advice or secrets.



Max started dating Ann eight months ago. I had only met her twice before everything happened. The first time was at a Halloween party we threw with a bunch of friends. I thought she was nice, and we talked for about ten minutes, but we did not have much time to really connect. The second time was at a pre-Christmas dinner with our old housemates and their partners. That night was fun. We women ended up drinking wine and lying on the fuzzy carpet at the hostess’s house, and I felt like we bonded.



Daniel and I went on vacation before Christmas and knew we would not see Max again before he left for his own trip with Ann. We decided to send him his gift early. The gift was nothing scandalous. Daniel bought concert tickets for the two of them to go to a band they both love, and I preordered Max a book because we are both fans of the same series. We started reading it together back in 2009, and I only preordered it because I was already buying it for myself. He had preordered the last book in the series for me in 2020, so it felt like a small, thoughtful gesture to return the favor. We also included some candies, a Christmas card, and a small gift for Ann... a scented candle she had mentioned, some Spanish toffee, and coffee syrup.



Max called us while we were on vacation to thank us. He was excited about the tickets, said he was looking forward to the book, and thanked us for the treats. It all seemed fine. After we got back, he left for his trip, and I did not hear anything until Ann called me.



Ann said she wanted to talk about the Christmas gift because it made her uncomfortable. She said the concert tickets and the book felt too personal, like something a partner would give, not a friend. I immediately clarified that the concert tickets were from Daniel, not from me. I explained that Daniel and Max often give each other expensive gifts like that since they are best friends. I told her that just last year, Max gave Daniel a gaming headset that cost almost $200.



She then said it was more about the book preorder and that it felt overly thoughtful. I explained that the book was something Max and I both enjoy and that I only preordered it because I was buying it for myself anyway. I pointed out that I do not preorder books for Max every year, and this was just because it was part of a series we have both loved since 2009. It was not meant to exclude her or send any kind of message.



Ann pushed back, saying she felt like I was competing with her. That confused me, so I asked her why she felt that way. I told her there was no competition because we are not even in the same race. She is clearly his girlfriend, and I am just a friend. There is no overlap in our roles, and I wanted to make that abundantly clear.



She then said it felt like I knew Max better than she did. I told her that of course I know him very well because we grew up together and have been friends for over twenty years. However, that does not mean I know him the way she does. I explained that I am not privy to his most intimate thoughts or feelings because my relationship with him is very different from theirs.



At that point, I decided to ask her directly if this was really about the Christmas gift or if there was something else bothering her. I asked if I had ever said or done anything that made her feel uncomfortable or disrespected because I would be happy to address it. I told her I was willing to compromise if there was a genuine issue, but I needed her to tell me what it was.



She got defensive and said it was not about anything specific, just that the gift felt like too much. She kept circling back to the idea that it was overly personal, even though I had explained multiple times that it was not intended that way. It started to feel like she was grasping for reasons to justify being upset.



Max also sent us a gift. He got Daniel a bottle of whiskey he had been wanting for months and sent me a nice pair of gloves and a scarf set because he knew I had lost mine. Ann did not seem to have any problem with that.



In the end, I told her I was genuinely sorry the gift had made her uncomfortable, as that was never my intention. I made it clear that I was willing to apologize for how it made her feel, but I could not apologize for the gift itself because I truly did not think there was anything inappropriate about it. I also told her I could not quite understand why she felt it was inappropriate in the first place. I pointed out that I could not undo the gift or take it back, so I asked her what resolution she was hoping for. She seemed frustrated and said she just wanted me to acknowledge that it was inappropriate. I told her again that there was no ill intent behind it and that I was happy to talk about any boundaries she felt were important going forward, but I did not feel apologizing for the gift itself was reasonable. Now I am left wondering if I handled this wrong. Am I the asshole for standing my ground and refusing to apologize for the gift itself?",2,1736768512.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1i0c1oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cutdowndrinking/comments/1i0c1oc/a_success_story/,A success story!,"Thought I'd share my story in case it helps anyone out. I'm a woman in my early 30s, mom to two young kids. I grew up in an environment where moderate daily drinking was the norm, both from family and friends, and as I got older adopted that myself. At other times in my life (before I had kids) I had some crazy nights involving alcohol as well. In hindsight I don't think I ever had a particularly healthy relationship with alcohol, but I was uneducated around the dangers of alcohol and always thought what I was doing was ""normal"". 

 A few years ago I read Elizabeth Vargas' memoir which detailed her struggles with alcoholism and it really opened a door in my mind, although no meaningful change occurred at that time. As time went on I lost *several* family members to alcohol enduced liver failure, and then had kids, and knew something had to change. At that point I sort of unintentionally cooled it but was still consuming 10-14 drinks a week, more than a woman should.

In October I started realizing I had brain fog. And I wasn't happy with how my body looked. And working out was a struggle. And I just knew in my heart that alcohol was holding me back from being my best self. So I woke up one day and said let's do something about this. 

I am big advocate of intuitive eating and the idea that you pay attention to what you put in your body, how it makes you feel, and restriction is not an option. I've been following this for 10 years and have always maintained a healthy weight. Black and white thinking has never worked for me, and I knew that never drinking again would lead to me yo-yoing and binging. So I decided to come up with my own plan to drastically reduce.

The first week I drank (a small amount) every other day. As soon as I was able to accomplish that I started stretching out dry time. The next week I drank once every two days. Once I hit that I drank only the weekend. Once I got that I took a full week off. And once I got there I decided on what my new limits would be - 2 drinks a week max, for me.

In addition to cutting back I also focused on alcohol education, putting new habits in place, and changing how I drink. I listened the Huberman Labs podcast on alcohol and other sober curious and ""damp"" podcasts, and I read lots of quit lit. I focused on creating new habits like drinking sparkling water while cooking and eating dinner during the week, or finding other dopamine hits like eating chocolate or drinking coffee instead. And when I do drink I make sure it's always with food and typically low ABV, I find this makes it much easier to stop at 1. Whenever I failed a goal took some time to assess what happened and what I could do next time to be successful. I also use and HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Try Dry app. It has custom goals and allows you to see both streaks and total dry days. It's very friendly to the moderating crowd and it's free!

So that's it for me now. I still can enjoy a drink on a Friday night or a date night with my husband. Some weeks I don't even drink. I don't feel deprived or like I'm missing out. I don't even think about drinking during the week now because I seem to have successfully replaced that habit. The brain fog has greatly improved, I'm making physical gain, I very much enjoy my hobbies and have a lot more joy in my life. I'm so happy I took this approach!",5,1736768261.0,cutdowndrinking,0,1.0,False

1i0bzyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/policeuk/comments/1i0bzyi/on_going_wibble/,"On going ""Wibble"".","Morning All, 

There have been an increasing number of posts regarding officers' struggles with personal MH / young officers feeling overwhelmed and I wanted to offer my personal experiences as someone currently working through the same. 

For context - I'm a Sergeant with double digit years of service and I have been ""lucky"" to have had an extremely... ""varied"" career.


**1. You are your own worst enemy** 

If you are anything like me, you have this concept of a police officer - brave, robust, dedicated etc. This makes it all the more jarring when you finally do go ""wibble"" as you have to reconcile the person you want to be with the person you are. All of us have a breaking point, and whether you see it creeping up on you or it takes you by surprise, none of us are indestructible. So be kinder to yourself and give yourself the space to work though your trauma 


**2. There is no hierarchy of trauma** 

*""He's gone off work for that!?""* 

*""She didn't even do much at that job. Not sure what she's got to be upset over"".* 

*""Clearly not robust ebough.""*


All phrases I have heard in my service. All bullshit. The single most important point I try to get across to my team is **""This job is not normal.""** As a member of a police force, you will go to places no one else does, see things hidden from view and be exposed to sights sounds and smells that most can't conceive of. You'll run towards danger and put yourself in personal harm on the daily. Most people experience a handful traumatic events in their lifetime. The loss of a family member say or a divorce. We privileged few get to experience a wide variety of trauma (our own and others) on the daily. We go to what Cmdr Sutherland called ""The Hurting Places"" and we're supposed to grit our teeth and get on with it. 

Its my experience, personal and professional, that rather than one big traumatic event, most cops are simply worn down by the slow drip of small to medium doses of trauma on the daily over course of years. Throw in shift work, regular dumps of adrenalin and poor diet and its a recipie for disaster. 

So that officer who's finally gone off with stress after attending a run of the mill domestic? You have no idea what's led them to that place. Be kind and be understanding.


**3. I need time off but I'm not sure how it works** 

So for whatever reason you've been signed off. What happens? I'm going to presume for the sake of argument you're a substantive PC. ~~Probationers~~ Student officers are governed by different rules and I don't want to get into the weeds of reg. 17 etc. However the broad strokes are the same for substantive and non substantive officers.


Firstly, under regulations you are entitled to 6 months full sick pay. You just need to present a doctor's note confirming you are not fit for work. You'll likely be expected to maintain contact with your line manager for an in person visit at set intervals. Mine meets me at a coffee shop. 

After 6 months you *can* be knocked down to half pay but this is not a sure thing. Chief Officers have discretion to keep an officer on full pay should they wish to so personal circumstances will apply. If you are put down to half pay, many Federation group insurance schemes will top you back up by varying amounts. Some Feds top you back up to full pay, others to 80 or 90%. If you think you'll be off longer than 6 months speak to the Fed early doors to get the ball rolling. 

Most importantly; ***Do not feel guilty for taking time off***. This is a job. It will go on fine without you. Think of all those people who left the force that you promised to stay in touch with and never did. The job will go on without you. Do not be guilt tripped (by yourself or the force) into coming back before you are ready. You're allowed 6 months. If you need it, use it. 

Secondly - Avail yourself of the OHU and Group Insurance. If you have access to wellbeing breaks through the force or the Fed, use them. If the job offers you counseling, try it. These schemes exist for a reason and they can be helpful. 

Thirdly - invest in yourself. Use the time off wisely. I'm trying not to rot at home. Do physical exercise if able. Smash those DIY projects that have been piling up. Go for long hikes. Do whatever it is that helps you unwind and relax. You have the gift of time. If you have decided that the police is no longer for you then use the time to decide what it is you want to do instead. But if you need to rot at home and smash a TV box set every so often then do that too. 

4. Reach out. 

If you are in work and you can see the cliff edge approaching, don't sit still, reach out. I didn't and it meant I fell over all the harder. I felt responsible to my team to stay in work, trying to push myself to get beyond some arbitrary date in the future beyond which I would feel happy to go off. To no one's surprise I didn't get there. I set myself on fire simply to keep others warm. 

If you need help, ask for it. Likewise, if you know someone who is off sick, reach out to them. I've been overwhelmed by the number of people firing me a ""just checking in"" whatsapp offering to go for a walk or breakfast. It means a lot. 

Its a long career, you need to look after yourself to make sure you actually enjoy that pension into a decent old age. So be kinder to yourself.",42,1736768065.0,policeuk,8,1.0,False
1i0bzr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1i0bzr9/any_clever_ideas_worsening_atrial_fibrillation/,Any clever ideas - worsening Atrial Fibrillation,"Morning,

To try and cut a long story short, I was diagnosed with A Fib in 2018, had two ablations in 2019 however it returned in 2021. I am currently 57 and am in the UK, so at the mercy of the NHS.

My cardiologist put me onto flecainide and bisoprolol, however I still continued to get episodes but it seemed to settle fairly quickly.

Midway thru 2023 (July) I was getting an elevated heart rate at rest, when walking. Even when doing light exercise my heart rate would jump to around 135 bpm and stay at a straight line, not dropping if I eased off and not increasing if the load increased.

In consultation with my cardiologist we stopped flecainide which seemed to help massively.

Since then I've been on 2.5mg bisoprolol twice daily, I seem to get exercise triggered Afib throughout 2024 but it has been getting steadily worse. I've attached a screenshot of my Apple Watch AFib Burden, where you can see an increase over recent months. I've had two spells of 4/5 days of persistent AF in the past fortnight. One started last Thursday after the easiest, slowest indoor bike ride I could do and I'm still in AFib as I type this.

I tried 200mg flecainide as a PIP on Sat and another 100mg an hour later which didn't seem to help. I also tried an additional 2.5mg bisoprolol on Saturday lunchtime.

In consultation with the arrhythmia nurses in Leeds we have tried various different drugs as follows:

Adizem - gave me a really bad rash

Flecainide - helped for a few years then made things much worse

Carvedilol - never really worked

Amiodarone/dronedarone - they suggested too many potential side affects/liver toxicity

I am wondering if the bisoprolol is building up in my body and perhaps making things worse, and wonder if others have seen anything like that before or am I just clutching at straws?

Are there any newer drugs around that I should be asking my cardiologist about?

I'm awaiting a telephone consultation with my cardiologist, but wondered if fellow sufferers had any advice to try and reduce the ongoing episodes? I've tried the various breathing exercises suggested in the forum but they don't seem to help. I eat a very healthy diet, I cut out caffeine and any alcohol but that doesn't seem to have had any affect so did treat myself to a coffee this morning!

My consultant was reluctant to consider a third ablation when I last spoke to him about six months ago, I did read up about a hybrid/mini-maze ablation, wonder if people have any thoughts as to if this was worth investigating further?

And I have faith that Bill and Brett and Jason are waaaay ahead of me on this, but AITA for thinking basically everyone on this show is an irresponsible driver when it comes to intoxicants... EXCEPT Louis?

Jimmy admits in episode 1 he was still drunk and high from the night before at his session with Sean. But he tried to drive to work that day. Only reason he couldn't was his car had no gas. I've seen a LOT of Sunday morning roadblocks in my life. And I'd bet most people on this sub, especially Americans, have driven over the legal limit on the morning after.

No one ever Ubers or takes a Lyft, and when they do it's either a joke or secretly shameful. Like Paul fights like hell to keep driving, and even when he admits he's unsafe because he mixes Parkinson's with bourbon, he relies on others to drive him.

They all live in Pasadena, where the only way to get around is driving. And we constantly see them getting in and out of cars, and drinking. Drinks at Liz's house. Champagne instead of coffee. Brian offering to make martinis at 11am for his 17YO goddaughter. The cornhole bar. Derek drinking at least one beer literally everywhere he goes.

I'm faaaaar from judging.  But it is interesting that this show seems to have very deliberately set up a scenario where everyone in Jimmy's life, including himself, are guilty of the very thing that he seemed intent on punishing Louis for.

Like, I never quite understood how they went from ''Tia died in a car accident,'' which is tragic and deeply sad and part of the chaos of life, to ''Tia was killed by a dude who is to blame for it.''

I'm hoping season 3 gets into this a little more. At the very least, we can assume that now there's two non-drinkers in the Altadena extended universe with Paul and Louis. How are they going to see things when they realize it seems like almost everybody is downing drinks and gummies on the reg, and driving around like it's the most normal thing ever. Cos, let's be honest. In the USA I grew up in, it still is the most normal thing ever.

1. Just as the Stew Crew began to stress about post-holiday content…they were sent a gift from God above- SNOW. Surely this is a sign that their new home camera setup is right on track…Carlin spent the week filming mini vlogs that showed her heading to the boutique while dressed in Abercrombie, starting early morning workouts with Josie & showing her kids doing a chore, sleeping and finally playing in the snow. She filmed all of it with a new $1200 camera-her second one in 6 months. This was the week of the Stewarts tattling on each other as Carlin says Zade lost her $500 Oura ring and Evan lays bare who wrecked the Tesla (it wasn’t him). Evan isn’t going to let Carlin be the only one who films a workout so he sets up a camera in Planet Fitness so we can watch him and Trace get fit… what an unlikely pair. Layla was back to full time work this week filming a reel getting dressed and heading to ballet… It currently has 34,000 shares on instagram … And comments from an old man saying he would like to sit down and have a conversation with Layla, an older woman saying Layla is her future granddaughter in law, several comments about how much people love hearing her exhale… And someone comments about how she’s a woman in a little child’s body. The reel has over 600 comments on IG alone… This is blatant exploitation…how can they read those comments and continue to play dumb? Don’t be fooled -as much as Evan plays in front of the camera….The only one bringing in the bucks for the Stewart family is Layla. Carlin is meeting at the boutique with some Utah mommy and me dress designers… I guess she read Alyssa‘s comments and decided if Alyssa would not do it… She would! The Stewart’s have Starbucks and Arby’s in one day, but luckily Josie and Kelton show up for supper and Kelton brings homemade chicken noodle soup. Katie and Travis come to spend the weekend with the Stewarts because of the snowstorm and their need to film content somewhere besides their apartment complex. Zade has to check in for work and we see him playing with baby Harvey… At this point Zade just babbles away and his mother subtitles it to say whatever she wants it to say. In their weekly Vlog, we see they have purchased another Tesla, they recycle content on Zade’s speech therapy evaluation, and then it’s all about playing in the snow. Evan is shocked to hear Carlin say she has never been more excited for a weekend in her life because her siblings are coming over to play games and make a snowman… I guess that Dubai trip with just him was nothing.

2. Katie and Travis have purchased a half a million dollar home less than a year after leaving New Jersey. They show us the signing and the title company is tagged in everything…they also let us know over and over that Zach Bates was their realtor. Katie is super grateful to her brother for finding them a pocket listing. Travis has found a new way to stretch content by taking the Vlog from YouTube and slicing it up into smaller reels that they drop on Instagram and TikTok during the week. This gives them an entire week of house content. Hailey does not get time off and has to check in to film a tea party with Travis. Katie tells us that Hailey asks for a tea party every day with her daddy… Meanwhile, Hailey babbles like the baby she is… She must only speak in these full sentences when the camera is off. Travis has joined a basketball league with some of Katie’s brothers… So in between running away to Nashville, and working out, he has joined a basketball team… What does Katie do? Katie also tells us that Travis lied to her about the house, telling her they did not get it… He interrupts her every time she tries to talk… He seems very proud of lying to her all in the name of a joke. Travis wants us to know that God gave them the house and God paved the way… Make no mistake… Hailey gave them this house and Harvey helped. I wonder why God gave them a house and not Erin? Of course Saint Michael shows up to babysit for the Clarks on closing day… And the Stewarts are the very first people to see the new home… Guess they dumped their kids with Michael also. Before heading to Carlin‘s for the weekend, Katie films a get ready with me – beige edition, then Travis talks all over the top of her while she films a rocket money ad…. he wants to make it very clear that Katie is the spender and he is the saver…. they do not mention that Hailey is the earner.

3.  Slowly but surely Josie Balka  is spending less time in her hair pool noodle. Maybe it’s because the girlies are asking questions… people want to know how she is able to work out with that thing in her head, and then leave her sweaty stinky hair unwashed all day for days on end. People are asking because all week Josie films herself at 5 AM heading out for a workout and then films herself in her bathroom, preparing to shower. Obviously Josie got tripods for Christmas and the Balka home is now film ready at all times. Of course, she films the girls at gymnastics and she sits in her car talking about herself while Willow is in the car seat behind her, giving the camera dirty looks. Love the attitude, kid! After a soup supper with the Stewarts, the Balkas head out for ice skating and then Josie is in the kitchen, making sourdough cookies and cinnamon rolls living her best TradWife life. 

4. Alyssa Webster continued the long goodbye this week… her YouTube channel is still in her Instagram bio and their farewell Vlog has over 130,000 views… Twice as many as the Christmas special. The Webster family attends a Monday wedding where Alyssa is dressed in drapes and all four girls are in tablecloths that match. They look like a wall at Joannes fabrics walking around. She posts a late night question and answer on Instagram where she elaborates without saying anything about why they are no longer filming for YouTube. When she is finished prattling on, she says she has probably said too much… Homegirl you said nothing. She dives into the homeschool topic and tells everyone that she is not doing the accredited abeka program because Florida has so many checks and balances… She quickly deletes that story once she is bombarded by people telling her that Florida actually has many ways to avoid those checks and balances. Alyssa keeps filming herself smiling like the cat that ate the Canary while saying there are lots of changes coming. One thing apparently not changing? The hideous filters she continues to put on her children’s faces… King Rhett Of The Melting Face is front and center all week.  She posts her homemade granola recipe and then begins a marathon of soup making. She feeds her family soup three nights in a row and when people ask for the soup recipes…Alyssa says “look on Pinterest. That’s what I do.” Once again, she misses the obvious… People want her recipes and organizing tips and homeschool information… later in the week, she films herself getting all dolled up at 4 PM, just to sit on her couch. She also shows herself sitting in a coat inside because she is freezing… such a good look for an HVAC company owner’s wife. Kelly Jo Bates has been busy promoting an app to read the Bible through in a year.  In one last swipe at her family, Alyssa posts a program that allows you to read half of the Bible in six months… She says it’s for anyone who may feel “overwhelmed” by trying to read the Bible in a year. (Dining Room table education coming in clutch)

5. Whitney and Zach are dealing with sick children after the big family get together. Zach is more active on his Instagram, posting the baby and reposting funny family stories. He also posts about how proud he is to have represented Katie in the purchase of her new home. While Zach is busy playing real estate agent, Whitney is forced to cook another home chef meal… This time it’s the super unique cheese quesadillas and each child gets 2 small pieces. Zach is back in the Bates kitchen this week for more chopping vegetables. He talks about celery as if it is some exotic ingredient that he stumbled upon. Speaking of stumbling, he struggles doing two things at one time and blubbers his way through the recipe for chicken noodle soup. Whitney films at the boutique where they are having meetings and it feels like proof of life that they do show up… At least once a week. She is back at it slinging links… This time for rocket money. Apparently the app is still catching double subscriptions… Makes you wonder how well it works. Whitney says they have some big projects coming up at home and have a surveyor coming out soon… Is a pool in their future? Later in the week, Gil brings all of the kids that are still at home, including Warden, over to play in the snow and sled on the big hill outside of Zach and Whit’s house. 

6. Trace and Lydia‘s big secret was seemingly exposed during Gil‘s birthday party… Travis caught Trace mentioning a baby girl. So this week, in an effort to confuse the timeline, Lydia suddenly posts about being ten weeks pregnant. She talks about her cravings and her aversions at just ten weeks along and their Vlog starts with her very first visit to the doctor when Trace is still in Spain. Josie goes with her to hear the heartbeat. Trace is back at the barber for his weekly haircut and thankfully, Ryker is spared this time. Lydia jumps into the mini vlog craze filming Ryker‘s nighttime routine… She bathes him in the kitchen sink and Addee is there to help. We get lots of Maui content as the snow falls outside… White cat, white snow, white everything at Trace and Lydia‘s.  The weekly Vlog features them playing in the snow with the baby and Trace says all of his winter snow gear is packed up at the big house. He must have gotten a fancy drone for Christmas because we get lots of overhead shots of the family in the snow.

7. Sister Michael was at almost everyone’s house this week babysitting. She only had time to repost pictures of Gil‘s birthday on her own account. She even popped up in Florida to help Erin stave off a nervous breakdown. I don’t know what this family would do without her… Kelly Jo is a mere figurehead at this point.

8. Something is definitely up with Lawson and Tiffany Bates. I don’t do pregnancy speculation but she is either pregnant or they are baiting everyone to think that she is pregnant. All of her posts on social media talk about why she wants another baby… They drop a reel about buying coffee and hers is a decaf. Later, they both are fully dressed and she is in full make up playing in the snow with baby William. Her pants are noticeably unzipped… Like, Tiffy?…XYZ. Anyway, they finally get another YouTube Vlog out and it is all about their trip to Gil‘s 60th birthday. At this point we have seen this party from every angle and heard every story. What they don’t explain is why Tiffy is missing for most of the video. We only see a very few shots of her holding baby William. It’s a very Lawson forward Vlog, which makes it exceptionally hard to watch. He takes a minute to throw a ball to Duke the dog and tells us the dog has not seen baby Will in a month and he hangs out in their backyard with a neighbor’s dog. Lawson makes several comments about announcements being made at Gil’s birthday and you can hear him in the background talking about wanting a baby girl. 

9. Erin shows up on Instagram to push the link for her YouTube Vlog revealing their move. The video has 140,000 views and counting. She films them moving into the new house and we see Chad painting away while Michael folds a shaft wagon full of clothes. Once again everyone else is working while Erin walks around giggling. Their pantry is stocked with 10 gallon buckets of beans and rice. The kids continue to assault that poor orange tree in the backyard and Erin puts them to work making orange juice right there in the dirt. Just what everyone wants… Fresh squeezed orange juice touched by 12 little hands. Because Michael is there, Erin is able to drop a second Vlog and this time we see their Christmas in the Smoky Mountains with Bobby, Tori and the 100 children. We see Bobby reading a scary Christmas story all about sin… just what children need to be thinking about at Christmas time. Chad looks drawn and tired and angry as he explains to the camera that he has to head back to the swamp compound to paint repair and finish the move. Erin just keeps filming and keeps giggling. She previews her next Vlog, which means she is back baby and ready for those sweet YouTube checks to start rolling in.

10. Bits and Bytes… KJ continues to promote products-this week a Bible App…Carlin finally shows her backyard and there is no security fence around the pool…Alyssa promotes pillowcases and pats herself on the back for cleaning her children’s rooms…Erin films inside her Florida church while an old man yammers away and it’s a very small crowd. 

Have a great week friends and stay warm!

Just as the Stew Crew began to stress about post-holiday content…they were sent a gift from God above- SNOW. Surely this is a sign that their new home camera setup is right on track…Carlin spent the week filming mini vlogs that showed her heading to the boutique while dressed in Abercrombie, starting early morning workouts with Josie & showing her kids doing a chore, sleeping and finally playing in the snow. She filmed all of it with a new $1200 camera-her second one in 6 months. This was the week of the Stewarts tattling on each other as Carlin says Zade lost her $500 Oura ring and Evan lays bare who wrecked the Tesla (it wasn’t him). Evan isn’t going to let Carlin be the only one who films a workout so he sets up a camera in Planet Fitness so we can watch him and Trace get fit… what an unlikely pair. Layla was back to full time work this week filming a reel getting dressed and heading to ballet… It currently has 34,000 shares on instagram … And comments from an old man saying he would like to sit down and have a conversation with Layla, an older woman saying Layla is her future granddaughter in law, several comments about how much people love hearing her exhale… And someone comments about how she’s a woman in a little child’s body. The reel has over 600 comments on IG alone… This is blatant exploitation…how can they read those comments and continue to play dumb? Don’t be fooled -as much as Evan plays in front of the camera….The only one bringing in the bucks for the Stewart family is Layla. Carlin is meeting at the boutique with some Utah mommy and me dress designers… I guess she read Alyssa‘s comments and decided if Alyssa would not do it… She would! The Stewart’s have Starbucks and Arby’s in one day, but luckily Josie and Kelton show up for supper and Kelton brings homemade chicken noodle soup. Katie and Travis come to spend the weekend with the Stewarts because of the snowstorm and their need to film content somewhere besides their apartment complex.

Inside was 2 staff member, a new hire (25M) and a senior staff (35F). 

I can hear a little chit chat on-going, regular office small talk. 

But then I see the new staff body language getting weird, his shoulder start swaying left and right like a teenage girl in love and all of the sudden he placed his coffee cup in front of his crotch…as if hiding something. Just weird. 

And OH.MY.GOD. the eye contact, it was electric

After this tense moment the new staff faster go back to his desk…after quite a long toilet break…idk 

There’s no company policy against romance in office but I do not want this to affect productivity.

Q: Does GIA certify all diamonds?

Editor's Note: I'm currently writing a comprehensive book on diamond buying that dives deep into every aspect of the industry.

But, HOW and WHAT should you charge?

Do you charge per appointment? How about a backend split of each deal? Should you pass on SMS charges to the client?

My ethos…

Make it EASY for the client to say yes ;)

And the best way to find out what’s going to get them slobbering…

Is to ASK!

Here’s how I’d do it.

Before arranging a coffee date and doing a demo, I’d be asking:

* How many leads do you generate per month?
* How many appointments do you book from those?
* What % of the appointments do you close?
* How big is your database of old leads?
* Are you advertising?
* How much is a sale worth to you?
* What’s your gross profit per sale?

(I call all this the 'doctor's diagnosis')

Once you're up to speed…

Not only can you propose a deal that will get the client to HELL YES quicker than Usain Bolt’s 100m record. But, you’ll also get clear on how much and how fast you can expect to be paid.

For example:

Let's say they are generating 100 leads per month, and have a database of 5K.

I would say…

“OK, I think we can do something here, the good news is I can do this on a performance basis, with no costs up front”.

“Let's attack your database of old leads, because anything we convert is 'found money' to you”.

“I know you make $3K gross profit per deal on average, and you convert 1 in 10 appointments?”

“How about we do this on a per appointment basis?”

“You convert 1 in 10 appointments, so how about $120 per appointment?”

“If you close 1 on 10 of these, you’d bank $1800 from those”.

“Would that work for you?”

If the numbers stack for them, it's going to be an EASY yes.

If you want to go another way…

You could say…

“I know you convert 1 in 10 appointments into sales and make $3K gross profit per deal on average?”

“How about we do this on a profit share?”

“We’d split every sale we help bring in from your database, 50/50 on the back end?”

“Does that work for you?”

The faster you get these clients to YES…

The quicker you’ll start putting dollars in your bank and theirs.

Hi all, I feel like I ruined everything.
We have a 4 yo daughter and a baby on the way and my family is gone now..

For background, there's been cheating on his end multiple times (never anything physical from what I know/was told but I’ll never know for sure ) like hitting up several old sexual partners, talking explicitly to them and receiving pictures and planning to meet up, asking for random chicks number out in public, asking real estate agents if they'd like to go out for a coffee, even tried to link up with his therapist. Most of things him having told me because I made him confess because I new about the therapist and had him be honest to me until he told me about his therapist. He never even said it brought up the therapist ,he eventually stopped telling me things. These happened on 2 separate times. In between these period trust was never rebuild. We talked throughly on what I would needs, promised me and then would continue to do things that caused pain and rewounding.
Some of these being not checking out women in public, even the glances he thinks he sneaking, looking at sexually seducing ig reels and lurking through other chicks pages. These are things that l felt highly disrespected by &it only made me feel worse and more insecure about not being his type what so ever... so I tried to place boundaries which have truly never work for more than a couple months until the behavior came back.
I've expressed to him how this hurts and has made me feel negatively about myself and if I'm even attractive to him at all as he hardly ever compliments me. I've been so raw and vulnerable to him to the point where I've sobbed to him and felt so ugly. I've been asking for YEARS about these boundaries to no avail. This is been a constant battle in our relationship.

Fast forward this week. We have been in an argument since last Saturday after he read a journal prompt of mine. This journal was written after going through his phone after noticing him starting to do the same behaviors in person again and heel him emotionally distance and short tempered ( these behaviors have never led to be anything good so tbh I am hyper-vigilant with these types of things ). It made me feel anxious about if he started doing the IG stuff as well.
And yes he was, I felt so angry after feeling maybe we were finally making progress, maybe now he finally understands,  as he had been making changes in the relationship for this period of time (probably 3 months by this time). I felt my boundaries will never be respected and respected enough to be considered on how much pain it causes me to feel unattractive and like I can never compare to these thick big booty females. I'm petite.

On top of also sharing feelings of how his behavior towards me has been making me feel. Since pregnancy l've been having an extremely hard time with my emotions and have been short tempered and not very good at emotionally regulating and expressing myself in a healthy manner before brining something up. I have not been the best version of myself and l've expressed to him way before how I don't feel like myself and I'm going through a really hard time emotionally. Since maybe late October he has been making it a point to bring up all my short comings in terms of how l'm am.
However, I've had a lot of growing and therapy snd have been patient, forgiving, loving, communicative and encourage him to voice his concerns to foster a healthy relationship as much as possible. I’ve endured a lot for him, not just infidelity wise but emotionally I’ve held it down for us too. Now he's throwing everything in my face about me not being what I always ask from him etc. and saying things like how things don’t matter when your doing it which is not the case at all..  it hurts and I get him so l don't know I can make much excuse to that... mind you, I don't get upset for no reason, it's either the boundaries, disrespect, not honoring relationships agreements like repairs, going back on his word and things of that nature. Mind you, all things that he constantly struggles with. So being pregnant I feel it harder to handle the resentment that has pilled on from all these years and time after time asking for chances after HE leaves me. I can't even count the amount of times he has broke up with me and I had to take all my things to my parents with our daughter.


The feeling I've been feeling is that he feels that he is feeling emotionally superior to me with the name he calls me and the things he says like ""I know who you really are now"" "" you think your so aware"" and just belittling and demeaning me..


Well all that went into the journal in attempt to let everything out to process my emotions before I had to work instead of waking him up or sending an upset text. I felt proud of myself because l've been trying to work on my communication and working through my emotions since but he read it and he flipped out on me through text which has spiraled into so many other fights since then.


Today, he finally agreed to talking on HIS terms.
Meaning he's going to let everything out and I'm only allowed to give answer to the questions with no explanation which is really hard for me to do because he's able interpret things without full context. I have been put through this before so already knew it would just be feel letting him shut all over be and him wanting me to agree to his perception of things despite me asking if we could do it in a healthy way.


He was in full denial that he had done ANY of the things like checking out chicks and the IG stuff prior to everything!! Somehow we got into the topic where he says that he has seen me do things that make him question me but that's something that he just had to work on with his own insecurities. In other words, saying that I need to work through my insecurities. However I told him if there's things I'm doing it's valid for him to bring them to my attention because if it's something I'm doing that's making him feel any sort of way that's a boundary and something I would like to hear and know.
So he finally goes on to say that he sees me checking out guys too and I knew he'd go there.
This is where l'll be very honest and I told him I would be very honest with him. I have gotten to such an insecure place of how I feel about myself that when a guy notices me its almost like I feel ""maybe I'm not THAT ugly"". I don't get any sexual satisfaction out of this because it can be ANY guy and it's enough for me to atleast feel maybe l'm not so ugly and undesirebale all stemming from a place of low self worth NOT an ego boost. I also admit that I have done things like this purposefully (no actual lust behind it) just a glance to see if he would react in anyway out of spitefullness and to use that to show him how it hurts me. However he has never said anything so even more made me feel he doesn’t care (not valid and I know this was shitty of me to do :c ) So this is what he had been seeing and thinks I have been checking guys out when that is completely far from the truth. I have never lusted over a guy and I have never and I will ever get any sexual satisfaction out of checking out a guy the way men do to women. Might be a female thing or just a me thing but never did I intend those things in a lustful cheating way but I understand the trust that was compromised... He broke up with me because he said he feels betrayed and like the person he thought I was, i am not and he could never trust me again. I tried so hard to tell him it never came from a place to entertain or lustful intentions it was me feeling so insecure that noticing or feeling that some is looking at me so I see and they are and I look away super fast. Nothing that would EVER give anyone the opportunity to even think I like them. But he doesn't believe me and says I have broken his trust and he has never had anyone do this to him and I am the only person who knows him deeply and his first love that he doesn't know how he could get past this or ever see me the same.


Guys... I feel so conflicted. Because he has put me through the ringer and even in those times I tried to understand where he came from, why he did the things he did and if I could do anything to make sure I'm not contributing. I know that that's justifying my behaviors and I hate to do that.
Because he has violated our relationship in many different ways it's hard for me to even see what I did as cheating or as anywhere near what he did  but I was there for his feelings and fully understood that it is breach of trust. Period. and I understand that but I feel so hurt for the amount of times I have forgiven him and chose to move forward and believe the best in him even though he never continued to disrespect me in way of crossing my boundaries with the things he does.
He feels that I have made him feel like shit and entire time I was doing the same thing back even though I do not agree it's the same at all, he doesn't believe me. He also admitted that I was not delusional about what he was doing so that makes me even more frustrated that his only concern is himself and. It how he contributed to me feeling so low. Again not justifiable and I totally get that..

I started my day around 7, had a cup of coffee and showered. Each day really does get better. I highly suggest taking stool softeners early on, because the hospital places you on much stronger painkillers. I finally have regular bowl movements. The first several times I went it felt like rocks were leaving my body (TMI, but you'll appreciate following my advice).

The head nurse arrived at my Airbnb at 10. We used the ERC machine, then used the driver to the physiotherapy center (cost was only 7 Euros each way). We also swapped out the 100 mg tramal for 50 mgs because the 100 mgs were making me fall asleep (not really sleep, just a weird nap).

At physiotherapy, we did a variety of stretches (mostly old with a few new ones) before using a few machines. We places electrodes on my sore muscles to tense and relax them (this was supposed to be enjoyable but not so much lol). Then we used a compression machine to push blood around my legs (this was nice) followed by icing.

Physiotherapy ended around 1, and I used the driver to get back home. For the rest of the day I will be working, so I won't have much to report.",2,1736766231.0,limblengthening,0,0.75,False

1i0b7hj,https://i.redd.it/8gyqbd3zoqce1.jpeg,The Criticism of “Cloud Players” and the Persistence of Shader Creators,"In the comment section of a shader showcase, a small dispute unfolded. One user complained, “So many ads! Are you starving and desperate for money?” This statement directly touched a sore spot for many creators. The shader author did not argue back but responded humorously, “Gimme some French fries or a cheeseburger, please.” This lighthearted reply concealed a deeper sense of helplessness and the hard work that lies behind creative endeavors.

Shaders, which add unparalleled beauty and charm to Minecraft, may seem like simple files or parameter adjustments. However, few understand the technical expertise and effort that go into creating them. Shader creators need to master complex coding, rendering algorithms, and game engine limitations. They must fine-tune light refraction, optimize performance for various devices, and painstakingly test every effect. Every dynamic shadow or ray of sunlight breaking through the trees might result from dozens of failed attempts and adjustments.

Yet, this dedication often goes unnoticed, especially by “cloud players.” The term “cloud players” is familiar in gaming communities—it refers to those who critique content based on videos or screenshots without experiencing it firsthand. While complaints about excessive ads in shaders are common, many fail to realize that ad revenue is often the only way independent creators can sustain their work.

Shader creators are not game studios. They lack steady funding, team collaboration, or institutional support. Most are ordinary individuals who love Minecraft and pour their time and skills into enhancing the game’s beauty. What players may find “annoying” about ads could very well be the lifeline that pays for servers or a cup of coffee to fuel another late-night development session.

Faced with criticism, the author didn’t respond with anger but instead diffused the tension with humor: “Gimme some French fries or a cheeseburger, please.” This wasn’t just a joke but a candid acknowledgment of reality. Creators understand that criticism in the online world is inevitable, especially in an era where free digital content is taken for granted. Users have grown accustomed to receiving without offering thanks in return.

Perhaps we should look at shader creators from a different perspective. They aren’t part of large companies or professional teams. They are individuals who turn their passions into projects and share their love for Minecraft with the world. Without these unsung heroes, our gaming experience would be missing countless breathtaking moments.

The next time we complain about too many ads, can we spare a thought for the creator’s circumstances? When we criticize a shader for being “imperfect,” can we consider that it might be the result of someone’s late-night dedication? Behind every shader pack is the sound of keys clicking, the frustration of debugging, and a deep love for Minecraft.

Perhaps next time, when we see ads in a shader, we can view them as a form of support for the creator. Clicking on an ad takes only a few seconds, but for the author, it could be the motivation to continue creating. Let’s show more understanding and less judgment. To those who have brought countless visual wonders to our game, let’s extend our respect and gratitude.

Note:
I have blacked out the usernames and other personal information in the photo. If this still infringes on anyone’s rights, I sincerely apologize. These comments were something I came across while searching for shaders. This post is not targeted at any individual but aims to bring attention to similar incidents. Also, even though this is a discussion about shaders, shaders are a big part of building too. (One more thing, the purpose of this post is simply to inform everyone about this event, so it’s not closely related to the tags above.)

1i0b6x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1i0b6x6/thanks_to_feedback_from_this_community_ive/,"Thanks to feedback from this community, I've tweaked my kitchen design...feedback on updated floorplan?","See my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1hy351w/help_with_kitchen_reno_ideas/). After getting some feedback from the group, I've been in a stressed out anxiety spiral all weekend trying to figure out how to make our kitchen floor plan better before we have to accept our bid. After being told by a RTA Cabinet Company's AI floor plan generator that no optimal floor plan was possible, I felt validated that our existing footprint is a difficult one, lol.

\*\*Edit: I realize now I was temporarily insane thinking the dishwasher and sink needed some space...I'll remove that random cabinet in between but probably won't update the photos right away. Imagine it's gone and there are two ~36” bases in between dishwasher and bookcase for the purposes of feedback. Thanks u/Flamen04. Also, before any suggests adding more cabinets there, the blank wall next to the beverage fridge is actually a stairwell. I just didn’t know how to cut out the wall opening correctly with this free software. 

Then I realized I shouldn't try and make the back wall a perfect, full set of cabinets. I should lean in to the kitchen space and do something that works, is practical for my current family and future family, and also something that we can make look beautiful. (Also, I know there was a comment about the bid cost on the original post and whether that's everything...the quote we were going to accept was middle of the road, about $12k less than the highest bid, and \~$10k higher than another that wasn't an ""all in"" bid. The middle bid had everything the contractor and I discussed, save for how many can lights we'll be putting in in the kitchen and attached family room (which, again, we had discussed would be handled as a change order). We're in a MCOL area, I think, and we weren't planning on going crazy high-end on appliances/finishes/etc.)

So what I did was realize there's not going to be a great way to make the transition to a standard 24"" base cabinet to something skinnier look great. I also have a lot of a cookbooks, and I'm currently in the middle of building my husband a library in our den. I didn't love the eat-in island, either, and I know that extra 12"" to give people space to eat at the island meant getting rid of the cabinet near the existing fridge placement. So I added a bookshelf at the end of the back wall to just embrace the weird 20"" wall depth near the bay window. This would be helpful to hold my cookbooks, our dogs' meds, and any other random knickknacks we want to display. I may talk to the contractor about adding a cutout with a cabinet door for our robot vacuum/mop to live in, too. I also added a window seat along the bay window with a plan to eventually get a \~30"" wide rectangular table to allow for enough space between table and end of island. This keeps it an eat-in kitchen, with some compromises. The island is smaller, only 24"" wide, which is a bummer, but I think this design hits all the right marks in terms of more storage, more prep space, and more practical.

We originally loved the idea of a beverage station but gave it up in the designer's plans because of space. But I added it back in here and replaced the existing lower next to the fridge with a mini-fridge/beverage fridge. This is where our coffee lives now, so I think it would be awesome to have a place to moved canned goods from the fridge since we'll be downsizing to counter-depth with this design. Oh, lastly, the space between the existing range and sink was always too tight. I have a 14"" cabinet there now between the range and doorway, and I changed it to 12"" to gain 2 more inches between these appliances. It isn't much, but the husband and I walked it, and it does help with some of the bumping into each other that happens now, so I think it's worth it.

What do we think? I need to send this over to the contractor to get their thoughts on practicality (they have an in-house design team) + cost, and I have an outstanding question out to our designer but I'm not planning on waiting on her if we can't. Based on rough measurements, seems to have minimum 40"" around all of the walkways around the island. With a 30"" wide table, the person sitting with the island to their back would have \~38-40"" in between.",1,1736764578.0,kitchenremodel,8,1.0,False

However, their expansive layout can sometimes feel overwhelming or undefined. The solution? Rugs! Thoughtfully chosen rugs can transform your open space into cozy, well-defined zones while adding personality and texture to your home decor.

Here’s how to use [living room rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), [black and white rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/black-and-white-rug), and other options to create a seamless and inviting flow in your home.

# 1. Anchor the Living Room with a Statement Rug

In open floor plans, the living room often serves as the heart of the space. A carefully selected living room rug can anchor your furniture and visually define the area. Choose a rug large enough to accommodate your sofa, coffee table, and chairs, ensuring that at least the front legs of each piece rest on the rug.

**Style Tip:** A bold black and white rug can make a striking statement in a neutral living room, adding contrast and sophistication without overwhelming the space.

# 2. Define Dining Areas with the Right Rug

To distinguish the dining area from the rest of the space, place a rug beneath your dining table. The rug should extend beyond the table to allow chairs to stay on the rug even when pulled out.

**Practical Advice:** Flat-weave rugs or low-pile [carpets and rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) are ideal for dining areas, as they’re easy to clean and maintain. Opt for patterns that complement the overall decor while creating a subtle boundary.

# 3. Create Cozy Conversation Corners

In larger open spaces, consider creating smaller zones with rugs to encourage intimate gatherings. For example, a round or rectangular rug can define a seating area with two chairs and a side table. This works especially well near windows, fireplaces, or other architectural features.

**Design Inspiration:** A textured rug from a [rugs UAE](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) collection can add warmth and depth to these cozy nooks.

# 4. Unify Spaces with Coordinated Rugs

If you have multiple zones in your open-plan layout, use rugs to tie them together. While the rugs don’t need to match exactly, choosing pieces with complementary colors or patterns can create visual harmony.

**Example:** Pair a geometric black and white rug in the living room with a solid or subtly patterned rug in the adjacent dining area for a cohesive look.

# 5. Layer Rugs for Texture and Depth

Layering rugs is a great way to add dimension and personality to your space. Start with a large neutral rug, such as a jute or sisal option, and layer a smaller patterned rug on top. This technique works beautifully in open layouts, adding coziness without sacrificing the sense of space.

**Pro Tip:** Layering also allows you to incorporate different styles, like mixing traditional carpets and rugs with contemporary designs.

# 6. Use Rugs to Define Pathways

In open floor plans, rugs can guide the flow of movement. Place runners or smaller area rugs along natural walkways to connect zones like the kitchen, dining area, and living room.

**Functional Note:** Durable options from rugs UAE collections are perfect for high-traffic areas, combining style with practicality.

# Why Choose Rugs for Open Floor Plans?

* **Versatility:** Rugs can be easily moved or replaced to refresh your decor.
* **Acoustic Benefits:** Rugs help reduce noise in open spaces, creating a more comfortable environment.
* **Zoning:** They define distinct areas without the need for walls, maintaining the open-plan aesthetic.

**Finding the Perfect Rug in UAE**

The UAE is home to a wide variety of carpets and rugs, ranging from traditional to contemporary styles. Whether you’re looking for a luxurious Persian rug or a chic black and white rug to complement modern interiors, rugs UAE retailers offer something for every taste and budget. Explore local markets or online stores to discover unique pieces that reflect your style.

**Final Thoughts**

Rugs are not just functional additions; they are essential tools for bringing structure and warmth to open floor plans. By strategically placing living room rugs and other styles, you can create cozy zones that invite relaxation and interaction. Whether you prefer a minimalist black and white rug or a vibrant patterned design, the right rug will help you transform your space into a harmonious and inviting home.
