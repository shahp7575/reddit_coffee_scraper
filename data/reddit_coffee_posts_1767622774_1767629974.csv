One morning you’re in traffic thinking this feels normal then 20 minutes later you’re walking somewhere that feels completely removed from a city. Coffee culture that isn’t performative or food thats genuinely good without trying to be trendy and people who don’t act like they’re in a rush to be somewhere else.



  
Now every other city feels like it’s missing a layer. Cape town quietly does everything at once and makes it feel effortless.",1,1767629910.0,southafrica,1,1.0,False
1q4pzv7,https://i.redd.it/m6ouuzy33kbg1.png,They Have Escaped My Dreams pt. I,"It*—he—*appeared again. 
A silent piece of amorphous darkness within the void.

He was waiting.
Stalking.

From the corner. 
To the front of the closet. 
To the foot of the bed. 

Standing.
Sprinting. 
Standing again. 

He stared with nothing and everything behind abyssal sockets.

At me. 
Through me. 
*Within* me. 

Adrenaline forced me from the bedsheets, shoving my shoulder blades to the headboard with a dull slam.
The impact stole the breath from my lungs in an instant.

He toppled forward like a rotting log collapsing into a stagnant lake.
His chest pressed hard to the mattress; his arms and legs spread out, like a spider filling its exoskeleton for the first time. 

His limbs clambered and undulated in feverish need.
Crawling, but never advancing. 

His hands were thin. 
Elongated. 
Sharp. 

They reached with malicious greed, but never close enough to touch the skin that the bedsheets failed to protect. 

The shadows whispered, incoherent and erratic. 
Secrets of a forgotten time. In a forgotten language.

My eyes couldn’t leave the shambling shadow of human mockery in front of me.

Every hair on my body stood like the darkness itself tugged at each end. 

The whispering grew louder and his hands grew closer. 
*Hungrier.*

But he still wasn’t close enough. Never close enough.

There were no lips to utter his secrets. 
There was no tongue to carry the weight of their atrocities.
There were no teeth to bite back their regrets.

Only the freezing absence of memories too absurd to exist.

But I could feel his breath by my ears as though he had neared to murmur gossip.
I could feel the screeching vibrato of his voice rumble in my bones as though it were from my own throat.

His face stopped inches from my own now.

Wavering. Shuddering. 
A quivering, featureless void.

Opaque enough for me to reach out and touch.
Translucent enough to remind me not to.

I held my breath, crushing my eyelids shut. 

The haze of adrenaline pulled itself from me like a wet veil dragged over carpet—slowly being replaced by the unsettling embrace that was waking reality.

———

When I woke up that morning, there was a burning ache behind my eyes, and a sickening dryness in my throat that crawled down and out from my chest.
My head was against the pillow, my back against the mattress. My shoulder blades radiated a muted soreness beneath me.

The old ceiling fan above the bed spun, slowly and wonkily, in a poor attempt to lull me back to sleep as I stared at it.
I exhaled a low, tired groan instead of heeding its lullaby.

My phone vibrated long and loud next to me on the nightstand, rattling the wood with obnoxious intensity. Instinctively, I slammed my palm down onto its face, gripping it and pulling it to my squinting eyes to slide my thumb across the screen. Once silenced, I nearly tossed it back onto the table, only to be met with another, more annoying notification with two sequential buzzes.

When I reached over again, I was suddenly more aware of the sludge in my veins that moved like a muddy stream. Another groan escaped me looking at the notification, as it read: 18.7➚mmol/L.  

A muttered curse escaped me before I swiped the alert away, and finally dragged myself up from the mattress to sit on the edge. 
Then I reached over to the deer-shaped mug on the nightstand that held an assortment of daily items—a nail file, a broken pencil, a cannabis vape, and two different types of insulin pens. 
I snatched one of the medications like it owed me an explanation.

Dose calculated, I dialed the plunger before pressing the top down to my thigh. I hadn't bothered to change the needle for the last few days. It stung more than it should’ve and I hissed through my teeth as the insulin burned like alcohol within an open wound. 

When I pulled the needle out, a bead of blood chased after it, and a tiny bruise already bloomed dark beneath the bubble. I thumbed the bleed away with an irritated sigh, and scratched at the swollen knot left by the dull instrument.

The floorboards creaked as I stood. 
A reminder for my upcoming therapy appointment chimed before I fully gained balance. The appointment hadn’t left my mind since it was first booked, but it was far and few between that I trusted myself to remember important details.

Dr. Byrnes had only spoken with me once before, back when I was waiting to be discharged from the hospital the month prior. She seemed nice.
My last experience with someone in her field was as a teenager. That, however, was forced upon me and during school hours, with someone whose kindness seemed motivated by a paycheque. Needless to say, I wasn’t keen on the thought of trying therapy again for a long time. 
But Byrnes seemed like someone I could talk to much more easily than the last woman. 
Though, I suppose that was part of her job, wasn’t it?

My mind continued to wander to nowhere as I dressed for the autumn morning. I threw on a sweatshirt with a graphic of a fictional faction printed on the front, and tucked it into a black skirt that I had pulled over black leggings. 
I didn’t fuss with make-up. Or jewellery.
I couldn’t be bothered. 
There was no need to try and impress someone, nor the want of validating compliments from passers-by. 

I paced the house like a lost ping-pong ball as I finished my routine. It still felt as though I was visiting Avó. 
As though she was seated in the backyard, chain smoking her menthols while she gossiped with my mother. As though my sister was sitting on the living room couch with her DS or cellphone, lost in her own world of entertainment. As though Vôvô still laid motionless in his bed, watching The Price is Right or Jeopardy, trapped in his stroke-stolen body.

It was just me this time. 
And will continue to be until I choose to go back home. Probably soon. I hadn’t decided how long I’d be here yet.

I managed to eat breakfast, even though there was zero want for any of it. It was more to stop my body from trying to make me regret walking instead of being sensible and taking a cab.
The last bit of strawberry yogurt was forced down with a chug of the instant coffee I over-creamed. Then the mug, still half-full, was left in the kitchen sink to be taken care of later.

My reflection soon stared back at me through the bathroom mirror—eyes pale, dull, tired.
Always tired.
My teeth were brushed after days of neglect, and the gum-bleed washed down the pale sink, streaking the toothpaste with an orange-pink hue. 
Strands of auburn hair fell after it, slipping down to the running water after the ratty knots relented against the hairbrush. 

The hair on the back of my neck stood as I subconsciously flicked my gaze to the glass door of the shower behind me. 
It had that old 70’s style: frosted and mottled, framed with bright and shiny brass, stained by decades of hard water and soap scum. 
The kind of style that definitely cost too much for the end result.

I half-expected to see shadowed fingers wrapped around the edge of the door. Remnants of last night rushed behind my eyes like a zoetrope. I shook my head, as though to clear those images away by force, and gathered the abundance of hair from the bristles to throw away.

There was one solace to my nightmares:
that they were only nightmares.
No matter how realistic they have become in recent months; no matter how much I believed in dreams having deeper meanings—they were nothing except figments of my anxiety’s desperately cruel imagination.

However, that didn’t seem to stop the sickening unease that left the house with me that morning. 
It clung to my back like a jockey gripping their horse’s neck, instead of its reins, the entire walk to Dr. Byrnes’ office.

———

“You seem healthier than the last time I’d seen you, Kaycee.” Dr. Byrnes sat across from me on the pale couch, one leg crossed over the other, back straightened in practiced poise. She wore simple jeans and a t-shirt, with a cardigan loose around her shoulders. Her eyes were as dark as her shoulder-length hair, and scrutinised me gently from beneath her squared lenses. 
I eyed the clipboard in her lap, noticing it held the same notes she had with her the day we first met; with the same almost artificially neat handwriting on the back of an appointment slip. 

“That’s surprising…” I muttered as I sat in the matching armchair opposite her, mirroring her posture in a poor attempt to mask the anxiety that pulled at the loose thread of my skirt. 

“And why do you say that?” Quick and to the chase to find what dropped me into her lap. I appreciated it. I wish I didn’t.

“I told you I’m not from Mississauga, yeah?” I began. The defense I wanted to hold was already dismantled before I could truly try to build it.

She nods. “You did mention that you moved into your grandmother’s place alone for the time being.”

“Right,” I nodded back. “I thought it’d be nice to get away from home for a while. And so far, having a clean slate, where I can still fall back on my family, has been refreshing. But at the same time…”

Dr. Byrnes looked at me with another, encouraging nod, already taking notes as I listened to her pen scratch across the surface. It melded with the clock’s soft, clunky ticks as the silence stretched thin.

My hand began repetitively smoothing the tops of my thighs as I avoided her gaze, looking anywhere but directly at her.
“At the same time, my sleep seems to have gotten worse. And it has always been awful… Since I was little.”

“You mentioned, back at the hospital, that you believed lack of sleep caused you to forget to take your basal insulin,” the Dr. recounted. “And that’s why you were hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis.”

“It really could’ve been anything—it’s not the first, second or even third time I’d been hospitalized, for the same reason, in the last decade…” I admitted with a shrug, chest tight with shame. My hand slowed marginally, stopping only when I tilted my neck enough to crack it on both sides. 
Fluidly. Out of habit.
“It was… just my best guess this time, given I have been sleeping more terribly than usual the last while.”

“Then tell me how a night is like for you normally,” Dr. Byrnes prodded. 

I paused, rationing examples as I began counting on my fingers, trying not to fall into a barely contained rant. 
“Well… my mind doesn’t shut up, so I cannot sleep in silence, and need both white noise and music. Most nights, I wake up every time I turn over. My blood sugar really plays a factor, too. If it goes high, it’s like sleeping with spiderwebs in my muscles. If it goes low, I get to wake up in a puddle of my own sweat.” I paused again, then chuckled awkwardly. 
“I could go on forever, really…”

“Well, we can go through the rest whenever you’re comfortable,” Dr. Byrnes offered with a curious glint in her eye. “If that’s your ‘normal’, then maybe we can find a solution together the more we talk about it during our sessions.”

There was a moment where I already regretted delving into my sleep hygiene in the first session.
Then another moment where I combed through memories of dreams, sleep paralysis, and whatever in-betweens.
Then another of the night prior hitting me like a hand cupping over my mouth from the dark.

It was only then that I clued into how incapable I was of sitting still, and why I avoided therapy:
My boots were left on the floor; my legs were fully tucked beneath me, my skirt surrounding them in a makeshift lap blanket. 
My hands wrung themselves above my lap, periodically reaching to pull at my earlobe or scratch at my collarbone.
I managed to nod after the bout of uncomfortable silence that probably only I found uncomfortable.

Her expression was warm as she put the clipboard next to her on the couch. She then leaned forward with her hands clasped and elbows resting on her knees. 
“I don’t expect you to tell me everything in one session,”  then her palms opened upward. “Just a bit to get us started. So that I know how to send you home.”

I nodded again; a little less awkward, and a little more confident in the fact that this woman wanted to help, not just cash in a cheque.

“Great. Now…” she sat back again, shoulders squared but relaxed as she returned the clipboard to her lap. 
“Do you have any ‘bad dreams’ or nightmares?”

I almost laughed.
“Since I was little.”

She smiled.
“Let’s start there.”

———

As I entered the house and shut the front door behind me, my ringtone started blasting in my ears. It nearly made me jump out of my skin, before I scrambled to yank my phone out of my pocket. All while almost throwing my ear buds to the floor.

“INCOMING CALL: Brian <3”

I quickly answered it and put him on speaker. 
“Hey, good timing: I just got back from my appointment.” I said as I made my way through the kitchen, setting down the bag of things I bought on the way home on the counter, along with paperwork.

“Perfect,” he replied. 
“I just started my break. How’re you?” 

We continued to chat about our mornings for the next few minutes or so. 
Mundane, but all hail the mundane.
I hadn’t realised how drawn tightly inward I felt until Brian’s voice unwound that cord. But there was still that strangeness clinging to the back of my neck from this morning. 

When I walked past the sink, something caught my eye. I stopped, staring at the mug I had placed earlier as Brian recounted something that he had dealt with at work.

It was… upside down. 
With no remnants of the coffee anywhere, or evidence of any other disturbance around the basin.
High pitched ringing cut through Brian’s story the longer I stared at it. The doe and fawn printed on the ceramic stared back at me with nothing behind their beady, upside down eyes.

I found myself reaching to scrutinise the art further, until a sharp, sour smell bombarded my senses the moment I lifted the mug. 
The coffee from this morning spilled out like a sac burst from beneath it. It was rotten and had chunks of something dark that didn’t look like spoiled cream.

The putrid scent gagged me, sending me reeling violently away from the basin and into the stove behind me as the mug clattered against the steel. 
The handle of the oven pressed hard into my lower back, but I barely reacted to the painful impact.

I think I heard Brian ask something, but my phone had skittered across the kitchen tile the moment I recoiled. 
The ringing didn't stop and neither did the smell. 
Both only intensified as I found myself lowering to the floor in a shivering daze. A deep, unsettling cold clawed its way down my abdomen synchronous with my descent.

I didn’t notice how much time had passed until the ringing stopped, and I could hear Brian yelling my name from the opposite side of the kitchen. My phone buzzed twice against the floor, then twice again a moment later.

It was then I felt the layer of sweat coating my skin and sticking to my clothes as I shook with each panted breath. Each one pushing through the thickness of the brain fog that overtook me.

“Kaycee!? Are you awake? Are you okay? Do you have juice?” Brian was the kind of frantic that was clearly restrained to prevent overreaction. 
“I remember the address, I’ll call 911—”

“I’m fine…! I’m good!” I somehow managed to yell back. “Just… lost balance. I’ll get something for the low in a second…” I was far too annoyed for someone who just had a possibly life-threatening medical emergency. 

“Are you sure? I’ll come down there early if I have to.” 

I pulled myself up with the edge of the counter, purposely aiming away from the sink as I stabilised myself and reached for the fridge.
“Yes, I’m sure, Bri. I don’t have much else happening that requires me to walk anywhere far this week, so this shouldn’t happen again.”

“You say that every time, then your blood sugar does some whack shit anyway,” he grumbled. “At least start taking a cab if you have to go somewhere? I’ll e-transfer you money if that'll make you do it.”

I chugged a juice box with the intensity of someone who has never had liquid in their life.
“A cab? In what’s basically Toronto? You’re hilarious.” I felt bad arguing when I had just scared him, but it’d be a waste.
“I’ll be more careful next time. Promise.”

He sighed, then chuckled. I could just see that stupid grin he always had when trying to rile me up.
“Fine. But if I find you comatose in a few days, you’re never hearing the end of it. I gotta go now, though. I’ll call ya later. I love you.”

“Ha, alrighty. I love you, too.” 

The second the call ended I slid my phone across the counter. I stared at the sink, disgust and anxiety simmering in my chest, as I unclenched the empty juice box I hadn't realised was still in my hand.
There was the tiniest speck of mystery matter visible from where I stood, and I could still smell whatever mess had been released. It was metallic, and a different kind of sweet than what I knew to be rotten creamer depression made me too familiar with.

I didn’t rush over just yet. 
I let myself recover from the low a bit more before braving whatever strange hell awaited me. 
When the shaking stopped, I stepped closer to the sink. 

What was left inside I could only describe as someone's failed beef marinade of grenadine molasses and clotted cream. Of which fruit flies had feasted upon before drowning in their gluttony with their offspring.

I had to stifle the gag that punched its way out with no warning, while an overwhelming part of me urged me to investigate further.

Everything rational tried to convince me that I must've spilled something into the mug from last night's dinner while I was getting ready for the day. 
That I must've knocked it over perfectly, with all the liquid still inside, and didn't notice in my tired haze.
That I didn’t have to do anything except clean it up and pretend it didn’t happen.

Instead:
“Fuck it.”

I looked away before inhaling deeply, then faced the sink again, grabbing a piece of the meat with my bare hand.
It was slimy, and softer than it should've been. It was the size of stewing beef, but far too frayed and uneven along the edges to have been cut by a knife. 
And, even while in such a state, it didn’t look like any type of beef I had cooked in the past. 

“What the hell are you…”

In a surge of urgency to get rid of it, I gathered the mess into my hands, while ignoring the growing nausea curdling my stomach as I carried the decay to the trashbin. 

After washing my hands, the basin, and the mug—putting it away in its usual spot by the kettle—I did a lot of ‘ignoring’ for the rest of the day.

I kept myself busy by going over the sleep hygiene ‘worksheets’ Dr. Byrnes had sent me home with. 
It was more of an act of reading than actually retaining information. 

Every so often I would still smell the rot. 
Each time my heart would race to burn in my throat with fear, before the scent disappeared the same moment. 
Each time I’d force the feeling away while the texture of the meat still stained my fingertips.

When it came time to get myself ready for bed, that earlier strangeness relented from my spine as I went about my nightly routine.
At first it was relieving, finally having it let go.
But over time it seemed to have been replaced by some other sensation.

I couldn’t quite place what it was.
Not yet, anyway.

1q4pz0z,https://archive.ph/39xdQ,The Death of the Public Library,">**Public libraries are in decline not because of the internet or because people are reading less, but because they have become de facto homeless shelters.**

>I was excited about the Mandel Public Library when I moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, in early 2023. The city was on the rise, and Fodor’s Travel had named Mandel the fourth most beautiful public library in America.

>Then I started going there.

>I watched a security guard tell a man who appeared to be homeless that he wasn’t allowed back for another month. In the new books section, a guy yelled into his phone that he’d been kicked off the bus for arguing with a driver. Other homeless people slept in chairs and snored; the smell made you hold your breath.

>Beautiful though it was, with high rounded ceilings and a coffee shop in the lobby, I wondered how people could use this library as a place to read and study. The answer, I soon discovered, is that increasingly, they don’t.
**Between 2012 and 2019, according to the Institute of Museum and Library Services, visits to the Mandel Library declined 27 percent, and total circulation—the number of items, including e-books, borrowed by library patrons—fell 26 percent.**

>And even as newcomers poured into South Florida, the trend has not reversed, with visits falling another 31 percent since 2019, meaning that **visits have declined a staggering 50 percent.** The statistic showing a dramatic increase, on the other hand, is not the one you want to see. According to the library’s director, Lisa Hathaway, “behavior incident reports”—everything from sleeping in the library to harassment of other patrons as well as staff—have risen **by 41 percent since 2019.**

>“It’s another reason,” Hathaway told me, “we hired a social worker.”

>My local library is hardly an aberration. All over the country, libraries are seeing fewer visitors and more problems. **Per-resident visits to public libraries fell by 56.6 percent in the 10 years ending in 2022.** Meanwhile, a report from the Urban Libraries Council found that between 2019 and 2023, **security incidents rose at its 115 member libraries, even as visits fell another 35 percent.**

>It’s not a coincidence, of course, that visits are down while incidents are up. When librarians talk about the decreasing visit numbers—which they prefer not to—they say that fewer people are coming to libraries because Americans are reading less. But with print sales up and bookstores making a comeback, that explanation doesn’t make sense. Rather, a major reason libraries are in decline is that, as a former librarian wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 2007, libraries have become “a de facto daytime shelter for the city’s homeless.” Indeed, when libraries research what people dislike about their institution, **they often find that the homeless population now congregating in the library is the biggest complaint.**

>In recent years, as it has become clear that progressive solutions to quality of life problems have usually backfired, cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco have begun retreating from them. But not librarians. Rather than resisting their emerging role as social worker and first responder to the homeless, **they have embraced it, to the detriment of everyone else who wants to use a library.**

>If there are two people who represent competing visions for what libraries should be, they are **librarian trainers Ryan Dowd and Steve Albrecht**. The two are friends, but their approaches are very different. Dowd, who once ran a homeless shelter in Aurora, Illinois, is the author of *The Librarian’s Guide to Homelessness: An Empathy-Driven Approach to Solving Problems, Preventing Conflict, and Serving Everyone*. **He told me he originally wanted to title the book *How to Run Your Library Like a Homeless Shelter*. When I asked if he was joking, he said he wasn’t sure.** He has given seminars for roughly half the nation’s librarians, including most of the largest systems. His influence is unquestioned.

>Dowd’s essential belief is that not only do the homeless have every right to spend their days in libraries but that librarians should view their needs **as a critical part of the job**. He believes librarians should be trained to dispense Narcan. One of his seminars is called “Jerks with Homes: How to Deal with Members of the Public Who Are Being Jerks About Homeless Folks.” His scripts for addressing problematic behaviors include examples like, **“Hey, I don’t care if you urinate on the Harry Potter books, but the politicians have a no-urinating policy. Therefore, I have to ask you to stop.”**

>Dowd advocates for “inclusion,” even when it seems to come at the expense of the library’s environment. In Dowd’s book, some people who complain about the homeless are “everyday sadists.” As for the body odor that permeates so many public libraries, he writes that **“There is a certain amount of odor that we can expect whenever we go out in public. Other people use odor as an excuse to vent their prejudices. Don’t let someone’s hypersensitivity or bias rule the day if the smell really isn’t that bad.”**

>When I pointed out to him that library visits were in steep decline, he said he was unaware of that data. Could any institution take comfort in smells that “aren’t that bad?” I asked.

>“To me,” Dowd said, “community means it’s literally for all, including people that might make us uncomfortable.”

>**Albrecht, a former San Diego cop who has done library security training for 25 years, takes a tougher approach.** He advises librarians to “stop apologizing” for measures designed to make their libraries safe and appealing environments. Some topics he covers in his webinar program include *Our List of Challenging Patrons: From Pets to Pedophiles*, and *Issues Enforcing Our Code of Conduct.*

>“We are losing control of a facility that has always been benevolent and peaceful for the community,” Albrecht told me.

>While Dowd’s trainings include strategies for reducing police calls, **Albrecht worries that many librarians aren’t calling the police enough.**

>“People in the library world sometimes misunderstand that one of the primary functions of the police is to preserve the peace,” he told me. “Police can do a lot of good by just telling someone they have to leave.”

>Most librarians I spoke with were nervous about discussing these problems because they’ve seen the consequences of bucking the progressive tide that swept America’s libraries. Amanda Oliver, a former Washington, D.C. librarian, is the author of *Overdue: Reckoning with the Public Library*, a book that describes the problems that come with the homeless takeover of the library. She told me, “I was only able to write this book because I was no longer a librarian.”

>Oliver still had to be careful. The book was published in 2022, and it explains that while hiring a police officer did reduce violent incidents and made some patrons feel safer, “The officers also did very little, if not nothing, to address the systemic issues in the neighborhood.”

>I said it seemed like a tall order to expect systemic issues to be addressed by a library cop. She agreed.

>“I think I treaded very, very lightly given the time period that it was,” Oliver said, referring to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement after George Floyd’s murder. “**I was trying to make sure that people know I don’t love police.** There was a lot of stuff that I did to make it seem even-keeled and empathetic. But I am even-keeled and empathetic, and I don’t think I needed that.”

>Even with her attempts to be empathetic, she said she still had talks canceled over her portrayal of the crisis in American libraries.
Albrecht has run into similar issues. In 2015, he wrote a book for the American Library Association called *Library Security: Better Communication, Safer Facilities*. But, he said, in the wake of the 2020 protests, the organization canceled a second edition of his book because it didn’t want to be associated with a former cop. (The ALA didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.) He said he found the episode “very hurtful,” and he has since removed his law enforcement career from his LinkedIn page and from some of his marketing materials.

>“I don’t want people to have some preconceived notion that I’m some Hitlerian guy,” Albrecht said. “I just want people to have a nice time at the library.”

>I asked Oliver why librarians are so cautious about all this.

>“My best guess is that it has something to do with wanting to uphold the very romantic stereotypes about what libraries are,” she said. Discussions of libraries are filled with slogans like “Everyone is welcome,” and there is little appetite for questions about how that can work in the world as it currently exists.
In 2018, Fobazi Ettarh, an academic librarian, wrote a paper in which she coined the term *vocational awe*. The paper, which quickly went viral among librarians, is a sharp takedown of what it calls a popular belief that “libraries as institutions are inherently good, sacred notions, and therefore beyond critique.”
Although Ettarh is a progressive—she described herself as a “radical librarian”—she doesn’t shrink from discussing the failings of libraries.

>Ettarh grew up the daughter of a pastor, and she told me she hears echoes of the church in the ways librarians talk about libraries: Conflicts and contradictions are dismissed, and tough questions are sidestepped.
For instance, Ettarh wondered how librarians can dispense Narcan and then host story time. “Library workers—who are already overworked and have little to no medical training or mental health support—are expected to repeatedly take on this issue, and are celebrated for it as if adding this very charged task to their job expectations is natural or uncomplicated,” she said.
Albrecht agrees with her. When someone uses Narcan to awaken addicts from an opioid fix, he said, “They come back delirious and vomiting and angry that you interrupted their high. It seems out of scope for the librarian’s job description.”

>But according to the Los Angeles Times, a third of Los Angeles librarians have now been trained on Narcan use—a development that is mostly celebrated in the media and among librarians.

>But as libraries stock up on Narcan, efforts to implement rules to improve the environment encounter resistance. For instance, some libraries have implemented limits on bag sizes in response to concerns about bedbugs and bad smells when homeless people bring all their possessions with them. **But homeless advocates, including those in West Palm Beach, call this an attack on the homeless. Ettarh disagrees.**

>“Anything that limits access to the patrons in any way is seen by many as a betrayal of the library rhetoric that all are welcome,” she told me. “But those who are, for better or for worse, paying taxes toward the community—their needs are also vital. There are always limits on what you can bring into any sort of space. I don’t see how the library is exempt from these rules and expectations.

>“It ends up falling on librarians to try to strike some impossible balance,” she said.

>The shift toward a social-services mission can be seen in the stacks: Between 2010 and 2022, the print book collections in America’s public libraries shrank by 19 percent, according to Institute of Museum and Library Services data—**even as retail sales of print books rose.**

>Tim Coates, who ran the British bookstore chain Waterstones in the 1980s, calls the decisions made by libraries a “complete misdiagnosis” of what the public wants. Since 2019, he has published surveys called the Freckle Project that gauge changes in reading habits and how they affect libraries. He says that the data shows that people want libraries to be about “books and a nice place to study.”

>He finds the state of things agonizing. **“They’ve taken all the things they’re good at and lost them in the pursuit of something they’ll never be good at.”**

>Librarians, for the most part, are not open to this critique. When the American Library Association had its annual meeting last week, the discussion wasn’t focused on these depressing statistics. **Rather, the group’s incoming president spoke about the role librarians play in preserving democracy.**

>“How on earth can a librarian’s role be to preserve and protect democracy?” Coates asked in a post on X. “Their role is to help people find what they want to read.”

>“I’ll say circulations and visits are down,” Coates told me. “And they’ll say that’s not a measure of what we do, because *we transform people’s lives*. But if people aren’t coming, then you’re not transforming their lives.”

>When I asked Lisa Hathaway, the director of the Mandel Library, whether she found it a challenge to serve both her traditional library patrons and the homeless population who spend their days there, she disagreed with the premise. “We don’t necessarily see serving our diverse population as a challenge. It’s a core position. **Challenge is not a word we use here at our library**.”

>In January, **Barnes & Noble announced that it planned to open 60 new locations in 2025—a record—on top of the 57 stores it opened in 2024**  In making the announcement, a company spokesperson told People magazine that “Many readers were looking for a place to spend time and connect with other people in their community. **Our bookstores became a safe and welcoming space to meet up with friends and explore the stacks.**”

>This, of course, is the role libraries have historically played—and should still play. Instead, as libraries look to be “everything to everybody,” as one librarian put it, they are becoming less and less to fewer and fewer people.

>Current practices aren’t solving homelessness, but seem well on their way to destroying the public library. As one anonymous librarian said in response to a survey about mentally ill library guests, “This problem, *not the invention of the internet*, could prove to be the final demise of the public library as we know it.”

>“I really understand why so many library workers want to keep saying yes. But, ironically, it’s always giving in, always saying yes—that’s what will lead to the destruction of libraries.

I also want to add a coffee station to this space and I think if I have a breakfast nook up against the left hand side of the wall, they’ll be room to put a coffee station against the wall on the right hand side.

In the last week of December 2025 I was coming back from my office  soberish drunk and one of my friend was getting a tattoo it was pretty late so she asked me to come and give her company. When I reached there I wanted to smoke a cigarette.I went out to a smoke shop I was chatty and in a jolly mood. While smoking a cigarette I saw a beautiful girl smoking beside me as a natural response I started chatting her up I made her laugh teased and got her number. Then I went home with my friend. 

After an hour I thought I should build up on What I started so I texted her talked to her for like 10 mins and asked her if she want to go out and drink with me and she said yes. I picked her up around 2330 we went to a shop and bought some alcohol we started drinking we finished half a bottle in my car then I didnot want to drive any more so I asked to go to my place . At place we talked some more we were having real deep conversation. Then I just placed my hands on her cheeks and started to corress them gentle and soon she started melting In my arm , I don't know how we started cuddling and hugging because I am a gentleman and she was drunk I did not make any other move and to be honest I was enjoying the cuddling way to much. After an hour or so she asked me to drop her because her job starts in an hour. So I did that.

Next day I message her she replied but there were late and felt like it was an obligation to her. So then I stopped texting her for like 7 days and she didn't msg me either . Next week I messaged her and asked her out for a coffee she said yes and made plans and then at the last moment she said I am getting late I have some work at the end after 5hr 30min later she met me and said ki me best friend had come so I was with it I got soo pissed like she could have just told me and I would be ok no but she dangled me with 1hr 1hr 30min etc . Then she apologized and ultimately that day too we ended up cuddling at her . Next day was new year and she was sick so I Cooked a meal and took some medicine and took it to her she got better we both started drinking again cuddled and talked and roamed around the city and I left her home 

Next day she called me and asked me to hangout I was pretty confused by her behaviour so I said Directly that I like her and what are her intentions with me she said she likes me but she is has broken up with her bf a month ago and she was not able to move on and she only want to start dating again when she is fully moved on . I respected that but I also said either I want you completely or nothing. She said I really like you. That's it. Now it been 2 days she has not messaged me and I have not messaged her . 

On one side my brains says donot contact her if she likes you she will contact you . And my heart say forget everything and go and hug her.

Guys and Gals kindly help me I am so fu*king confused I don't know what to do ? I just know that I can't stop thinking about her . Please help 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",1,1767629661.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

DELONGHI Magnifica Plus ECAM320.70.TB Bean to Cup Coffee Machine

I’m really struggling to establish which of the two machines would be the better purchase and would appreciate some input from others who reviewed both. 

Both machines seem so similar, parts, coffee making technique, price.etc  Current thoughts:

\- Whilst the Rivelia has two hoppers, I really can’t imagine this would be a regular used feature. Not a deal breaker. 

\- The Rivelia seems to have more automation in the milk frothing process and apparently makes better milkier. Is this a deal breaker? 

\- Magnifica seems to make a better espresso, is it really that noticeable?

1q4psny,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.getqota.www.twa,"I (Linux Admin, 25y exp) hated splitting receipts manually at Christmas – so I ""Vibe Coded"" an app to do it for me (No Frameworks, Vanilla JS)","Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a little Christmas project of mine that got slightly out of hand.

Disclaimer: I typed this text with my own hands on my own keyboard, but I used Gemini to translate it. My english is ok, but Gemini is quicker. Hence the formatting looks a bit slop-ish.

**A bit of background:** I’ve been in IT for 25 years (started as a Dev, now a Linux Admin). My wife and I decided early on to split our shared expenses 50:50. I don't pay for her Coke habit (the drink, not the drug, lol), she doesn't pay for my coffee consumption. Most other daily necessities are split down the middle.

This led to a situation over the holidays where I pulled a huge stack of grocery receipts out of my pocket and had absolutely zero desire to type everything into a calculator to figure out who owed what.

Since I recently got access to Claude Code and my wife was working shifts, I had some free time to see how far I could get with my old dev knowledge combined with some ""Vibe Coding.""

**The Tech Stack is super simple:**

* Vanilla JS
* SQLite (might migrate to MySQL later)
* HTML/CSS
* PHP for the API
* Gemini for OCR/Text Recognition

No frameworks, no Flutter, no React. Just the basics.

**The Challenge (OCR):** I started with standard OCR tools (Tesseract, etc.) and could extract text, but I had huge trouble linking the data fragments. Suddenly an apple cost as much as the milk, and the kiwi price was mixed up with the deposit refund. It was a mess. I then switched to Google Vision AI + Gemini Flash and after just 3 iterations, I had extremely reliable image recognition that actually understood the context of the receipt.  
In the end I even dropped Vision AI and went for a single Gemini 2.5 flash API call.

**From Prototype to App:** After ""shoving together"" a prototype in a few hours, I wanted to fix the design. The initial draft from Claude worked but looked like Bootstrap from 2010. I asked Gemini in Canvas Mode to design a better UI. I wanted it intuitive, modern, and lean – a top-tier MVP! Honestly, the first result was a blast. It even included dummy pages for the scan process, and everything was clickable. I was hooked.

I liked the design so much that I decided to polish it and release it, thinking it might be useful for others too. I spent 2 more days on it, bought domains, survived the painful verification process of the Google Play Console, and now the app is actually live.

**The Business Model (Transparency):** I don’t expect to get rich with this, but I can't operate at a loss. Since every scan costs money via the Google API, I can't offer the app completely for free.

* **Model:** No annoying subscriptions. It works on prepaid credits.
* **Cost:** 50 scans cost €2.39 (approx. $2.50). This covers server & API costs. Credits do not expire.
* **Free Trial:** Everyone gets 10 scans completely free to try it out.

**Privacy:** I'm a Sysadmin, I hate data hoarding and tracking.

* Servers are hosted in Germany (Hetzner Cloud).
* No tracking SDKs, no ads. I only look at server logs to see if the lights are on.
* Accounts & data can be deleted with a single button press.

**We scan, but we don't judge!** Uploaded images are automatically deleted after 30 days. The extracted data stays until you delete it. I might lower the retention window later, but for now, I want to be able to debug issues if users report problems with specific receipts. Failed scans are not charged (or will be refunded if you let me know that it went wrong).

The App is called **Qota** and is available on the Play Store (Link in comments).

I would love some feedback—especially on whether the AI handles your crumpled receipts as well as it handles mine! Lighting matters a lot, though.

What should I do?","I (29M) have a younger sister (24F) and we were never super close, but we were normal. Texting memes, grabbing coffee every couple weeks, venting about our parents, that kind of stuff. About 2 months ago she started posting a lot of ""energy"" content and talking about this guy she calls her guide/teacher. At first I rolled my eyes and kept it moving. Now it's gotten weird. She keeps saying she ""finally sees the truth"" about people in her life and that some of us are ""draining her light"". Last week she told me, pretty calmly, that I am ""toxic in a quiet way"" and thats why she always felt anxious around me. I asked what she meant, because we literally havent fought in years. She said it's not about fights, it's about my ""frequency"" and how I ""control the room with skepticism"". Then she said if I want to stay in her life I need to come to one of these sessions so he can ""clear the cords"" between us. I told her no, I'm not paying some random dude to do a ritual on me. She got cold and said I'm proving her point, and that refusing is ""my ego protecting the wound"". Since then she texts me these long paragraphs about how I'm stuck in fear and how she can help me heal if I stop being defensive. She also keeps trying to get me to agree that I was a bad brother growing up, like asking ""do you admit you were emotionally neglectful?"" out of nowhere.



Here's the part that has me torn: she isn't acting manic or totally out of it, she's just very certain and very intense. She cut off two of her longtime friends already because they ""mocked her path"". My mom is the type to ignore stuff until it explodes, and my dad thinks it's all a joke, so I'm not sure telling them helps. I don't want to validate this by going, but I also don't want to lose my sister to some weird culty situation. If I refuse, she frames it as me rejecting her. If I engage, she turns it into a t

1q4ppwt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4ppwt,Taking my new tote to work for the first time,"I wanted to get a leather tote to carry both laptop and essentials for the new year, so I finally got one! My must-have was that it had to have a top zipper.

Pros: The bag is very spacious and can fit a LOT. It has just the right amount of pockets so it doesn't overwhelm you with options (two slip pockets, one zippered pocket, and one laptop sleeve inside). I like the outside zippered pocket, where you can slip in a keycard or phone for easy access. I also love the pocket inside where you can put a slim bottle, since I always take coffee to work. The leather and quality of the bag is very nice.

Cons: It is a bit heavy, but I think that's always going to be the case when you add a laptop. (It's not so heavy on its own). I also wish the straps could flop down so it's easier to store the bag.

The bag is the Antique Career Tote by Eriko Yamaguchi (also called Motherhouse in Asia).",1,1767629253.0,handbags,1,1.0,False

I recently got a 1Zpresso Q Air grinder and I use an Ikea French Press. Nothing fancy, just trying to make good coffee with freshly ground beans.

I do not really understand flavours yet. I have read about things like body, acidity, fruitiness and clarity, but I have not actually developed a taste for them, so I am not chasing any specific flavour profile right now.

From browsing this subreddit, the roaster names I keep seeing are  
Blue Tokai  
Savourworks  
Kapi Kotai  
Grey Soul  
Devans  
Naivo  
Bloom

Earlier I used to drink pre ground coffee, mostly Blue Tokai Vienna Dark Roast.

I would love suggestions on which beans are good for a beginner, what roast level might be easiest to start with, and anything that works particularly well with a French press.

He used the right language, talked about consent, asked questions, said he’d read bell hooks in college, all that. He kept calling himself a feminist and honestly I was like ok cool, maybe this will be normal for once. We went on two dates, nothing wild, just coffee and then tacos. He was charming in that ""I’m so emotionally aware"" way. But the minute I brought up anything that made me even slightly uncomfortable, it turned into a discussion panel. Like I said I don’t like daily check-ins from someone I barely know, it makes me feel watched. He smiled and went ""Interesting. Can you unpack why you think you feel watched? Because thats not a healthy attachment response."" I laughed it off but it kept happening. If I didn’t answer for a few hours, he’d send ""Just checking you’re ok. Communication is important."" If I said I was busy he’d reply with this calm little lecture about being ""intentional"" and ""showing up."" It always sounded reasonable on paper, but in my body I felt tense, like I was being graded.



The part that’s messing with my head is how he frames it. When I said I didn’t want to go back to his place after date two, he said ""Of course, your boundary is valid. I just want to understand what fear is driving it."" He used the word ""valid"" like a stamp and then immediately tried to interrogate me. When I told him I dont like being analyzed, he said I was being defensive and that as a feminist man he values emotional honesty, and I was ""weaponizing boundaries"" to avoid intimacy. That phrase made my stomach drop. I asked him to stop turning everything into therapy-talk and he replied that I’m uncomfortable with accountability. I can’t explain how insulting it felt to have my basic preferences reframed as a character flaw. I started double-guessing myself like, am I being unfair? am I actually the problem? Then I re-read our texts and it’s just him constantly steering the convo back to how I should improve. He never once says ""oh got it"" and drops it. It’s always a calm argument where he wins by sounding more rational. I feel like I’m going crazy  , because if I describe it out loud it sounds small, but living in it feels like being slowly nudged out of my own reality. Is this a known type of guy? How do you shut this down without getting sucked into another debate?

1q4pn9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/1q4pn9a/bppv_out_of_nowhere/,BPPV out of nowhere?,"For a bit of context, I recently came back to my boyfriend’s state (we are in-between states right now as we used to be LD) on Dec 29th after he spent the holidays with my family. 

For the first day I was fine, nothing out of the ordinary hot flashes due to my low estrogen. But I started feeling light headed on the 30th and slept a LOT. I couldn’t even spend time with his brothers who had just come to see us since we left bf state for the holidays and we’re going to be moving back to my state permanently, as you can tell said hangout meant a lot to me but I was very lightheaded and fatigued, I felt like I couldn’t even lift my head. I forced myself to sit through new year’s midnight feeling heavy. 

The next day, the 1st, I woke up to a loud bang because my bf had fallen out of his chair. I hop up out of bed and saw black with stars so I stool still until it went away and asked if he was ok. He said yes so I went back to bed, I thought nothing of it, just oh I got up too fast, happens to everyone but a few minutes later he calls me to get my coffee and I get out of bed and immediately feel faint, I’m trying to keep myself up but I’m so dizzy that I walk funny in like a curved line and I fall to the ground directly on my side and arm because I couldn’t catch myself. I blackout for a second and then I sit up, bf comes to check on me and I tell him I blacked out, don’t know why. 

I told him what happened 30 minutes before with the seeing stars and he says we should go to the hospital. I told him no, that he knows I have low estrogen so it’s probably that. From that moment forward, anytime I had my head a certain way for about 5 minutes, if I moved my head in any different direction, I would feel like I was doing backflips. Not spinning around in a circle, like I was doing BACKFLIPS. It happens every time I change position. If I’m sitting and stand up? Vertigo. If I’m laying on my back and change to my side? Vertigo. If I’m looking straight then look up at the ceiling? Vertigo. If I’m standing and then go to lay down? Vertigo. I find it the WORST when I’m on my back and then turn my head to the right specifically. I have actually recorded my eyes during these episodes and my eyes violently shake.

This has been going on since the 1st of Jan, it’s now the 5th. For 4 days straight if I change my position I get really bad vertigo so I did research and it’s called BPPV when that happens. What could have caused this? My bf says maybe turbulence from the flight. Idk. I don’t know if the time when I got up and my vision went dark with stars is connected or not, neither the day where I felt heavy and tired but I thought if they did it’s best to mention it.

How could I have gotten BPPV out of nowhere?? It just restarted happening 4 days ago…

They hate waking up exhausted. Every day, millions slap the snooze button, scroll half-asleep, then rush into the day already behind. It’s not just a lack of discipline. It’s deeper than that. It’s biology, environment, and habits working against you.



This post is a no-fluff guide based on deep-dives from Dr. Andrew Huberman, peer-reviewed sleep research, military training protocols, and behavioral psychology. Not hacks that work once. Systems that help you rise early like it’s second nature.



Here’s what actually works:



1. Get sunlight in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking



Huberman can’t shut up about this because it works. Morning sunlight triggers your circadian rhythm. It sets the brain’s internal clock, boosts cortisol (in a good way), and tells your body, “We’re awake now”. A study from the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020) showed that people who get early sun exposure fall asleep faster and wake up earlier consistently.



No sun? Use a 10,000 lux light box for 10 minutes. But real sunlight is 10x more powerful. Don’t wear sunglasses. Don’t look through windows.



2. Stop using your phone as an alarm clock



Phones equal distractions. You wake up, see emails or TikTok, and your brain is instantly hijacked. Use a simple analog alarm clock. Put it across the room. This forces you to stand up. That movement alone increases alertness by 15%, based on research from Stanford’s Center for Sleep Sciences.



3. No caffeine for 90 minutes after waking



Sounds backwards but it’s not. Adenosine is the chemical that makes you feel sleepy. Caffeine blocks it. But it doesn’t clear it. If you drink coffee too soon, you’ll crash hard later. Huberman recommends delaying caffeine 90–120 minutes after waking. This allows natural wakefulness to build first, so caffeine works longer and doesn’t mess with your sleep pressure cycle.



4. Wake up at the same time. Every. Single. Day



Variability kills circadian rhythm. Even one “sleep in” day can throw your system off for 72 hours, found research from Harvard Medical School (2017). Your body craves rhythm. Pick a wake time and stick to it—even on weekends. After 14 days, your body will wake up before the alarm.



5. Use “NSDR” or Yoga Nidra if you feel wrecked



Sometimes you sleep poorly. That’s life. Instead of napping, use Non-Sleep Deep Rest. Huberman swears by it. 10–20 minutes of guided NSDR (available on YouTube or apps like Reveri) helps reset your system. It improves focus, memory, and helps “clear out” sleep inertia. Studies from Dr. Sara Lazar’s lab at Harvard back this with fMRI data.



6. Go to bed EARLIER, not just wake earlier



You can’t cheat sleep. Adults need 7–9 hours. Going to bed at 12 and trying to wake up at 5 will fail long term. To wake at 6, start winding down by 9. Use blue light blockers. Read or journal. No screens. Sleep is built during the hours before sleep.



These steps aren’t magic. They’re behavioral loops. Once stacked, they change your default settings. No more willpower battles.

figured i'd share some tips from my last trip because honestly, i love being right on the river but the mosquitoes usually turn it into hell. this time, i beat them.  
  
the first thing is campsite selection. this is super critical. mosquitoes love standing water and dense, windless areas. you want the opposite. look for a site that gets a good breeze, even if it’s a little farther from the water's edge. if it rained recently, choose a spot that gets a lot of sun, which helps it dry out faster. if you are near a slow-moving river or a marshy area, you'll have more bugs, so fast-moving water is better if you can find it. sometimes the big, crowded campgrounds are the worst because the spots are tight and damp. if you ever need a break from that and want a safer, dry, paved spot, i've used prked before to rent a driveway or private garage nearby for a night or two between longer trips. it's way cheaper than a full campground and your car or rv feels safer on someone's property \[cite: prked\_detail\].  
  
for gear, your rv is your best friend if you seal it up. check all your window and door seals, even the tiny ones, because they can get in through small cracks. always keep your doors zipped or closed as much as possible, especially around dawn and dusk, which is peak mosquito time.  
  
now for the arsenal. i went full bore this time and it paid off.  
first, i treated all my outdoor gear and clothing—pants, shirts, and a screen tent—with permethrin spray a few days before leaving. this stuff is just for fabric and it's a game changer.  
  
second, i used a couple of thermacell devices. they have one called the ex90 for rvs that creates a 20-foot zone of protection without you having to spray your body every 30 minutes. they work by heating a mat that releases repellent into the air. i kept one near the outdoor seating area.  
  
third, for yourself, i recommend a spray with picaridin. it's effective for up to 12 hours and doesn't feel as greasy as deet, plus it's safe for your gear.  
  
finally, some natural and low-tech hacks:  
\- a box fan. seriously. mosquitoes are really weak flyers, and a fan set up on your picnic table creates an artificial breeze that keeps them away from your eating area.  
\- burn sage or rosemary in your campfire. you can throw a few sprigs of the fresh or dried herbs right into the fire and the smell and smoke acts as a natural deterrent.  
\- wear loose, light-colored clothing. they are less attracted to light colors like white, tan, and gray, and loose fabric is harder for them to bite through.  
  
do all these things and you can actually enjoy your coffee by the river in the morning without ending up as a giant walking bite.

# The Heartbreak Prescription

One night, Stanley received the divorce papers from Wendy. Her reason for wanting to get a divorce was due to his failing potency. Seeing him approach, Wendy smiled gracefully and asked, “Stanley, are you here for an andrology consultation?”

One day, Wendy discovered that her husband Stanley was having an affair.

He had been seeing a college student.

It was Stanley's birthday. Wendy had prepared a table full of dishes early in the day. Just then, she heard a notification from his phone.

Ding!

He had left his phone at home.

Wendy switched it on and saw a text from the college student.

\[I hurt myself when I was carrying the cake. It hurts so much.\]

Attached was a selfie—not of the sender's face, but of her legs. The girl in the photo wore pulled-up white socks, black leather shoes, and a blue-and-white skirt that had been pushed up to reveal her long, slender legs. Her pale knees were visibly reddened from the bump. The youthful, vibrant image of her body paired with coquettish words exuded a forbidden allure.

People often say successful businessmen like Stanley favored this type of woman when choosing mistresses.

Wendy clutched the phone tightly, her fingers turning white from the pressure.

Ding!

Another text came from the college student.

""Mr. Hawk, see you at Cloud Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday!""

So, his mistress wanted to celebrate his birthday tonight.

Wendy grabbed her bag and headed straight to Cloud Hotel. She had to see for herself who this college student was.

She soon arrived at the hotel, ready to go in. Just then, she saw her parents, Harry and Lilian at the entrance. Surprised, she walked up to them.

""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?"" she asked.

Harry and Lilian, caught off guard, exchanged a glance before responding to her hesitantly.

""Wendy, your sister's back in the country. We brought her here,"" Harry said.

'Jessica?'

Through the hotel's gleaming floor-to-ceiling windows, Wendy spotted her sister Jessica and immediately froze.

Jessica was wearing the exact same blue-and-white skirt from the photo in Stanley's phone. The college student was none other than her own sister!

Jessica had always been a beauty, known as the 'Red Rose of Hovendale,' and she was famed for having the most beautiful legs in town. Many men had been captivated by her charm. And now, her darling sister was using those legs to seduce her husband.

Wendy found it laughable. She turned to her parents and said coldly, ""So I'm the last to know?""

Harry gave a sheepish smile. ""Wendy, Mr. Hawk doesn't even like you.""

""Exactly, Wendy,"" Lilian chimed in. ""Do you know how many women in Hovendale are dying to be with Mr. Hawk? Better to let Jessica have him than some other woman.""

Wendy clenched her fists. ""Dad, Mom, I'm your daughter too!""

Turning on her heel, she started walking away.

Lilian called after her. ""Wendy, tell me—has Mr. Hawk ever touched you?""

Wendy stopped in her tracks.

Harry's voice turned sharp. ""Wendy, don't act like we owe you anything. Three years ago, when Stanley and Jessica were Hovendale's golden couple, everyone thought they'd get married. But then Stanley got into a car accident and went into a coma. That's the only reason we had you marry him instead.""

Lilian gave Wendy a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Wendy. In the past three years, you've turned into a housewife who revolves around her husband. Meanwhile, Jessica became the principal ballerina of her company. She's a white swan, and you're just an ugly duckling. What do you have to compete with Jessica? Just give Mr. Hawk back to her already.""

Every word felt like a knife into Wendy's chest. Tears filling her eyes, she walked away.

\-

Back at the villa, night had fallen. Wendy had sent the maid Mathilda home, so the house was empty, dark, and cold.

She sat alone at the dining table.

The once-warm meal had gone cold. The cake she had carefully prepared had 'Happy Birthday, Honey' written on it in frosting.

It was glaringly ironic, just like her existence—a complete joke.

Stanley and Jessica had been the golden couple of Hovendale, with Jessica as Stanley's cherished 'Red Rose.' But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Stanley in a vegetative state and Jessica disappeared entirely.

That was when the Crone family brought Wendy back from the countryside and forced her to marry Stanley in Jessica's place. Wendy had agreed willingly when she found out it was Stanley—the man she had loved all along.

For three years, Stanley remained in a coma. During those years, Wendy devoted herself to caring for him. She stayed by his side, gave up socializing, and focused solely on nursing him back to health, living as a dutiful housewife. In the end, her efforts paid off. Stanley woke up.

Wendy lit the candles on the cake.

The flickering glow illuminated her reflection in the nearby mirror—a plain housewife in a dull black-and-white dress, devoid of charm or excitement.

Meanwhile, Jessica, now a successful ballerina, was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Wendy was an ugly duckling, while Jessica was the white swan.

After waking up, Stanley abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the white swan's side.

Wendy let out a bitter laugh.

This wasn't love; it was self-delusion. Stanley had never loved her, but she had loved him. The first one to fall in love always lost.

Today, Stanley had made her lose completely.

Tears welled in her eyes as she blew out the candles, plunging the villa back into darkness.

Just then, two bright headlights pierced through the night. Stanley's car sped up the driveway and came to a halt on the lawn.

Wendy's eyelashes quivered. He had come back. She had thought he wouldn't return tonight.

The villa door opened and Stanley stepped in, carrying the cool air of the night with him.

Stanley Hawk, the heir of the Hawk family, had been a business prodigy from a very young age. By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from Harfield. Later, he took Hawk Group public in Hawthorne, making a name for himself internationally before returning home to lead the company as Hovendale's wealthiest man.

Stanley walked in.

""Why didn't you turn on the lights?"" he asked in a deep, magnetic voice as he turned on the wall lamp with a click.

The sudden brightness made Wendy blink. When her eyes adjusted, she looked at him.

Dressed in a custom-tailored black suit, Stanley exuded a cold, aristocratic elegance that left countless socialites dreaming of him at night.

""It's your birthday,"" she said.

Stanley's handsome face remained indifferent as his gaze swept lazily over the dining table. ""Don't waste your time on this again. I don't celebrate such occasions.""

Wendy smiled faintly. ""Is it that you don't celebrate, or you just don't want to celebrate with me?""

Stanley glanced at her, his gaze impassive. ""Think what you like.""

With that, he turned around and started up the stairs.

He had always been like this—distant and cold. No matter what she did, she could never warm his heart.

Wendy stood and called after him. ""It's your birthday today. I have a gift for you.""

However, Stanley didn't stop or turn around. ""I don't need it.""

Wendy let out a soft chuckle and said, ""Stanley, let's get a divorce.""

Stanley froze mid-step, one foot already on the staircase. He turned around, his deep black eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Wendy was also staring at him. Her tone was light but firm as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Stanley. Do you like your birthday gift?""

Stanley didn't bat an eyelid. ""You're asking for a divorce just because I didn't celebrate my birthday with you?""

""Jessica has returned, hasn't she?""

At the mention of Jessica, Stanley's thin lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. He took a step forward, closing the distance between them. ""Are you bothered by Jessica?""

Stanley, known as the youngest business prodigy alive, exuded an aura of power, wealth, and status. As he approached, Wendy instinctively stepped back, her slender back pressing against the cold wall.

Her vision went dark as Stanley leaned in. He propped one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his firm chest and the wall.

Looking down at her with his deep, striking eyes, Stanley sneered.

""Everyone in Hovendale knows Jessica was the one I intended to marry. Weren't you aware when you schemed to replace her and became Mrs. Hawk? You didn’t mind then, so why act all self-righteous now?""

Wendy's face turned pale.

Yes, Stanley had wanted to marry Jessica. If not for the accident that left him in a coma, how could Wendy have married him?

She would never forget the day he woke up. The disappointment and coldness in his eyes when he saw her was devastating.

Since then, they had lived in separate rooms. He never touched her.

He loved Jessica.

Wendy had always known this, but...

She gazed deeply at Stanley's face, the grown man overlapping in her mind with the young boy from years ago.

'Stanley, do you really not remember me?'

It turned out she had been standing in place all along, waiting for someone that no longer existed.

It was enough.

These three years were just her one-sided effort to cherish him.

Suppressing the ache in her heart, Wendy said softly, ""Stanley, let's end this loveless marriage.""

Stanley's brows arched sharply, and his deep, magnetic voice could be heard. ""Loveless?""

He raised his hand, gripping her delicate chin, his thumb brushing against her crimson lips in a provocative motion. ""Is that why? Are you asking for a divorce because of that? Do you want it that badly?""

Wendy's delicate face flushed red like a ripe berry, vibrant and tempting.

That wasn’t what she meant!

Yet his thumb lingered on her lips, pressing and toying with them. She hadn't expected such a composed and distinguished man to have such a teasing, roguish side.

Stanley was seeing Wendy up close for the first time. She usually dressed in monotonous black-and-white outfits, paired with oversized black-framed glasses, presenting herself like an old maid.

But up close, he realized her face was barely the size of his palm, and her delicate features exuded a quiet elegance beneath those glasses. Her dark pupils were stunningly beautiful.

Her lips were soft, their plush surface springing back with a subtle elasticity wherever his thumb pressed.

It stirred an unbidden thought.

Stanley’s gaze darkened. ""I didn’t expect you to be so eager. You’re that desperate for a man, aren’t you?""

Slap!

Wendy raised her hand and slapped him across the face. Stanley’s handsome face tilted to the side from the impact.

Wendy’s fingers trembled with anger. She realized that loving someone too humbly only led to her dignity being trampled on. He had actually humiliated her.

Furious, she declared, ""I know you’ve never stopped thinking about Jessica. Fine, I’ll fulfill your wishes and return Mrs. Hawk’s title to her!""

Stanley’s face instantly darkened, frosty and sullen. A man of his stature had never been slapped before—never!

His sharp gaze locked onto her. ""Wendy, you married me when it was convenient for you, and now you want a divorce just because you feel like it. What do you take me for?""

Wendy let out a soft chuckle. ""A plaything.""

""What?""

Stanley’s expression stiffened.

Wendy forced herself to endure the pain in her heart and said what she knew would hurt him. ""You’re just a toy I took from Jessica. I’m done playing, so I’m tossing you aside.""

Stanley’s expression turned grim, his mood darkening to the point where it could drip with venom. ""Fine! Wendy, you’re something else. Let’s divorce, but don’t come crying back to me, begging for reconciliation!""

He stormed upstairs, slamming the study door shut with a deafening bang.

Wendy felt as though all the strength had been drained from her body. Slowly, she slid down the wall, crouching on the carpet. Hugging her knees, she whispered to herself, 'Stanley, I won’t love you anymore.'

\-

The next morning, Mathilda entered the study.

Stanley was seated at his desk, reviewing documents. He was a notorious workaholic.

""Sir,"" Mathilda greeted Stanley cautiously.

Stanley didn’t even look up. His icy aura hinted at his foul mood. It felt cold being around him.

Mathilda carefully placed a cup of coffee by his hand. ""Sir, this coffee was made by Mrs. Hawk.""

Stanley’s pen paused mid-air, his cold expression softening slightly.

Was she trying to make amends?

Truth be told, Wendy was an excellent wife. She cooked to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and meticulously managed his daily needs.

Stanley picked up the coffee, taking a sip. It was her coffee—the taste he liked.

But he was still angry.

She had slapped him last night, and he wasn’t about to let that go easily. A single cup of coffee wouldn’t suffice as an apology.

""Did she admit she was wrong?"" Stanley asked.

Mathilda glanced at him hesitantly. ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk has left.""

Stanley froze, looking up at Mathilda.

She handed him a piece of paper. ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk left this with her suitcase and asked me to give this to you before she left.""

Stanley unfolded the paper. The words 'Divorce Agreement' caught his eye.

His expression darkened. He thought she was trying to reconcile.

Mathilda added cautiously, ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk asked you to finish the coffee before signing the divorce papers.""

Stanley glared at the coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

'Sir, you seemed to like the coffee just fine a moment ago. Why don't you anymore?' Mathilda thought to herself.

Without saying another word, she quickly left with the coffee.

Stanley’s face was a thunderstorm, his mood in turmoil. He skimmed through the divorce agreement. She wasn’t asking for a penny—she intended to leave with nothing.

Stanley scoffed coldly. It was bold of her to act like she didn’t need his money. How would a country girl like her survive without it?

It was then that his gaze landed on the reason for divorce, handwritten by Wendy herself.

""Due to my husband’s physical dysfunction, he cannot fulfill his marital obligations.""

Stanley froze, his handsome face turning completely dark.

'That woman!'

He grabbed his phone and dialed Wendy’s number.

The line connected, and Wendy’s voice came through clearly. ""Hello?""

We’re doing a small birthday thing at an indoor trampoline place this weekend, like 10 kids from his class plus a couple cousins. Nothing fancy, but I booked it weeks ago, paid the deposit, did the invites, all that. My dad (56) is divorced from my mom and he dates a lot. Like, not judging, but it’s been a revolving door since I was a teen. He tends to move fast, and he also gets weirdly hurt if we’re not instantly excited for whoever he’s seeing.



Two weeks ago he tells me he has a ""serious"" girlfriend now (Tara, 27). I have never met her. My son has never met her. My husband has never met her. Dad says she wants to come to my kid's birthday because ""we’re a package deal."" I said I’m not comfortable with that. It’s my son's day, he gets overstimulated already, and I don’t want a total stranger at a kids party where I'm trying to keep track of 10 sugared up little gremlins and their parents. Also, the last time my dad brought a girlfriend to a family thing, she got tipsy and started interrogating my aunt about ""who is the real father"" of her kid. That was a whole mess and dad acted like we were mean for being annoyed. So yeah, I have baggage here.



I told him he is welcome to come, but please come solo. If this relationship lasts, I’ll gladly meet her another day, like coffee or brunch, and then maybe she can come to stuff later. He blew up. He said I’m ""controlling his life"" and treating him like some embarrassment. He also said I'm teaching my son that adults can be excluded and that I'm ""punishing him for dating."" Then he said if Tara isn’t invited, he might not come at all because it would be disrespectful to her. I said, okay, that’s your choice, but I'm not changing my boundary for a kids party.



Now my dad is telling my grandma and a couple relatives that I'm being cruel and making him choose between his family and his partner. I feel guilty because I do want my dad there, and my son loves him, but I also feel like I’m allowed to say ""no plus ones"" when it's literally my child's birthday and I dont even know this woman. AITAH for not letting him bring her?

I left my consulting firm in September and joined a scale-up in a BizOps role. At the time, it felt like the right move after a really rough project experience that completely burned me out. I genuinely hated my day-to-day life then and felt like I needed a reset.

Fast-forward a few months, and I’m starting to question the move.

A few things I’m struggling with:

1. I don’t feel much job security at the scale-up
2. I thought I’d enjoy the sector more, but I honestly find it boring
3. I’m still doing a lot of PPTs — just on the same topic over and over, which feels limiting
4. I’m not convinced this role opens many doors long-term, and I feel a bit stuck career-wise

This has made me think about the idea of boomeranging back to consulting. Maybe the trade-offs are just part of the job, and I might have underestimated the optionality, learning curve, and brand value (?)

My questions:

•	Is it too early (only a few months out - since I left in September) to approach a partner about coming back?

•	When is the “right” time to have that conversation?

•	What’s the best way to approach a boomerang — casual coffee chat, formal conversation? - to give more context. When I was leaving they offered me to work as an external with better WLB but I was in the middle of a lot anxiety so I rejected it. Also I know that in November they were asking to my cohort if I would come back. And they are hiring in my office (at my level) now.

• should I give the scale up at least 6 months before doing anything else?

I have a pretty good list of things to bring and itenerary for us to follow and was wondering if I may be doing something wrong. Please read below and give any tips, thank you.

**DAY 1**  \- We will hit the road at 5:00 am. At 7:00 am we will stop to get breakfast and continue to the Big Bend. The drive is roughly 9 hours and 30 minutes but with stops it should take us roughly 11 hours to get there and we will reach it at around 5:00 pm give or take. It is important that we reach before night time so we can easily hike to our first campsite which is Boulder Meadow.

**DAY 2 -** We will plan on hitting the trail right after sunrise to have enough time to finish our hike for the day. We will hike all the way up to Emory Peak which is the highest point in Big Bend, then hike down and around the South Rim to our next campsite SR3. This should take up a good chunk of our day and we will stop intermittently to eat food, drink water, relax, and take pictures.  

**DAY 3  -** In the morning, we will plan on making some nice hot breakfast and coffee and enjoying the view before heading around the West side of the mountains, back to our car. We will drive to Study Butte in search of a shower, and eating lunch. From there, we will head to the Santa Elena Canyon to look at the Rio Grande and take some pictures. Afterwards, we will drive down to the Cottonwood campground and camp there for the night. 

**DAY 4 -** We will pack everything up, and head towards Marfa, to look at the Prada store and will stop in between to get food. Afterwards, it will be a long drive back home to Houston.

**Required Items -** 

* Sleeping Bag
* Warm Clothes (underlayer, shirt, jacket, windbreaker, beanie, gloves, hat, etc)
* Backpack (make sure its somewhat big and able to hold your supplies)
* Water (at least 3 gallons each)
* Food (Use your creativity bring as much as you can carry)
* Toilet Paper 
* Toothbrush/deodorant
* Extra Cash

1q4oznz,https://v.redd.it/v8rni5j3wjbg1,What if college football had promotion and relegation?,"**TL;DR:** I’m proposing promotion and relegation for college football because the current system is bloated, top-heavy, and full of meaningless games.

Okay, hear me out.

College football has over 130 FBS teams, a playoff that only a handful of schools can realistically win, and a bowl system that exists mostly because TV networks want content.

So I tried to fix it.

The idea is a **tiered system with promotion and relegation**, similar to European soccer but built specifically for college football.

Here’s the structure:

* All FBS and FCS teams are split into **four tiers**
* Each tier has **four regional conferences** (Southern, Atlantic, Central, Pacific)
* Each conference has **two divisions** to keep travel and rivalries sane

**Tier One** is the top league. It uses a **24-team playoff** instead of conference championships. Early rounds are home games for higher seeds, later rounds use the major bowls.

At the bottom of each tier, there are actual consequences:

* Last-place teams don’t just disappear into the offseason
* Tier Two, Tier Three and Tier Four run conference tournaments
* Winners get a shot to move up, losers drop down

Instead of playing the Scooter’s Coffee Frisco Bowl for vibes, postseason games decide who stays, who moves up, and who falls.

End result:

* Every game matters
* Bowl games have stakes again
* Programs have a real path up (or down)
* Fans get fewer blowouts and fewer fake “exhibition” games

I know this isn’t perfect, and I’m sure parts of it would cause chaos. That’s why I’m posting it here.

◈◈◈

  
The bright lights of Yonah's beachside premier shopping district were doing absolute wonders for Amelia's mood. She held up two dresses in front of the trial room's full-length mirror, twisting left and right to catch how the fabric moved, how the colors played against her dark blue hair.

The lavender one had that thigh slit she'd been eyeing all season. Mature, sophisticated. The emerald green matched her eyes perfectly, but maybe it was too safe?

*Decisions, decisions.*

  
Her phone buzzed against the bench where she'd tossed it among the growing pile of ""maybe"" options. Amelia glanced at the screen, saw Jin's name, and her face split into an automatic grin.

  
*Finally! About time his damn phone was working again.*

  
She'd been texting him all morning about the trip, about the ridiculous hotel room service menu, about Mom and Dad arguing over which restaurant to try tonight. Radio silence. Which was weird, because Jin always responded. Always.

Amelia snatched up the phone and dialed the video call, propping it against the mirror so she could keep evaluating dresses while they talked.

""Jini!"" Her voice came out bright and cheerful, exactly the energy she'd been riding since they'd left Vienna three days ago.

""Okay, verdict,"" she announced. ""Heroine chic or tragic attempt at being heroine chic?""

The screen loaded, and Jin's face appeared.

Amelia's hands stilled mid-dress-swap.

  
*Something was wrong.*

  
Jin looked off. His light blue hair was disheveled; his pale blue eyes, normally casual and a little sarcastic, now held something that made her stomach clench, though she didn't understand why.

""I'm leaning more towards the lavender dress,"" she continued, forcing her mind to focus. Jin just had a bad awakening. That's all. ""It has a decent thigh slit design that I really like. Very mature, don't you think?""

Jin didn't answer immediately. Just stared at her through the screen like he was memorizing her face.

  
*Okay. This is officially weird.*

  
""Jini?"" Amelia lowered the dresses, stepping closer to her phone. ""You okay? Did something happen?""

Her mind immediately jumped to the obvious conclusion. Drugs? No, Jin would never. He barely drank, treating his health like a sacred thing. Trouble with the law? Also unlikely. Jin was too smart to get caught doing anything actually illegal, not to mention his close friendship with Rudy, the deputy commander's son.

  
*But that expression...*

  
She cycled through more dresses, talking faster to fill the silence that felt increasingly wrong, watching Jin's face in her peripheral vision.

""The blue one has better shoulder work, but this green one matches my eyes. Oh, and look at this red one! It's got these cute little—Jini? Are you even listening?""

""Yeah..."" His voice came out distant, distracted. ""The lavender one's good.""

Amelia paused, dress halfway to her body. Jin's eyes had that look. The one she'd seen exactly twice before. Once when Aunt Elena died, and once when he awakened his Mantle.

""Hey?"" She moved closer to the phone, studying his face properly now, zero pretense about looking at dresses. ""Earth to Jin? What happened to you? You're being weird. Like, weirder than usual weird.""

She took in more details through the video call. He was wearing armor—not training gear, but actual combat armor. And behind him, barely visible in the frame, was that Dad's sword?

""Jini, why are you wearing armor?"" Her voice climbed an octave. ""And is that... is that Dad's sword behind you? Are you okay? Did something happen? Talk to me, brother.""

""I'm okay, Ame..."" Jin's smile was wrong. All wrong. ""A few things came up. Nothing I can't handle. Don't worry about me. Tell me about your vacation instead.""

  
*Liar.*

  
Her bubbly enthusiasm drained away like water down a sink. The cheerful mask she wore for family and friends dissolved, leaving something else underneath.

""Jini..."" Her voice dropped to a flat, dangerous tone that made her sound nothing like the giggly teenager she'd been thirty seconds ago. ""What is happening there?""

She saw Jin blink, saw him recognize the shift in her demeanor. Good. Now he knew she wasn't to be messed with.

""You're not on drugs, are you?"" The question came out sharp. Her mind was already racing through possibilities, cataloging every detail visible through the screen. ""Because I swear to all the gods, I'll gut you like a fish if I find out you're doing something stupid with your life!""

Jin laughed, and for a heartbeat, he looked like himself again. ""I'm fine, sis. Truly.""

But then his smile faded, and that look came back.

Amelia's hands clenched around the lavender dress.

""Let's not worry about me."" Jin's voice carried forced lightness. ""I think that lavender dress is indeed good. It'll look great on you.""

""Jini, stop deflecting!"" Amelia said. ""And stop trying to change the subject! What's with the armor? What's with that look in your eyes?""

""What look?""

""You look like—"" She paused, searching for words that would capture what her instincts were screaming. ""Like you're going to war or something.""

The video quality flickered.

Amelia frowned, pulling her phone closer. ""Jini, the connection's getting weird. Can you hear me properly?""

""I can hear you fine.""

More static. The image of Jin pixelated for a moment before snapping back into focus, but worse than before. Audio was cutting in and out, words dropping like someone was randomly deleting syllables.

What the hell is wrong with the network?

""Amelia."" Jin's voice took on an urgent edge that made every hair on her arms stand up. ""I need you to listen to me very carefully, okay?""

""Jini, the connection—why do you sound like you're saying goodbye?""

""...No matter what you hear on the news...""

""Jini! Hey!"" Amelia called back, but the screen had already gone black.

""What the... I swear, Jini, if this is a prank, I'll tie you upside down in front of Seri."" She tapped the call button. Nothing. Tapped again. Still nothing. ""Come on, you piece of—""

  
***\[NO SIGNAL\]***

  
""That's bullshit. What do you mean, no signal? Jini is in a city, not living in some damn cave."" Amelia's finger jabbed the call button. Once. Twice.

Each attempt met the same result.

  
***\[THE NUMBER YOU ARE TRYING TO REACH IS UNAVAILABLE\]***

  
""What is happening... who can I call?"" Amelia thought until another familiar face appeared in her mind. ""Rudy!""

She scrolled through her caller list and found Rudy's number under the name 'Musclebrained Idiot'.

Amelia's finger tapped the call button. No answer. Just the spinning reconnect symbol, mocking her.

  
***\[THE NUMBER YOU ARE TRYING TO REACH IS UNAVAILABLE\]***

  
""Right. Cool. Great."" Amelia pressed the phone to her forehead like she could brain-magic it back on.

Her reflection watched her, wide-eyed and ridiculous. ""Maybe his battery died. Or the router exploded. Again. Or a squirrel chewed through the cable. Again."" She paced the tiny fitting room, dresses swaying like confused spectators. ""He's fine. Totally fine. Obviously fine.""

A knock at the door snapped her out of her thoughts.

""Are you buying that dress or not?"" The saleswoman hovered nearby, her smile strained in that customer service way that said she'd rather be literally anywhere else.

Amelia looked down. She was still holding the lavender dress. Or was it the green one? Her brain refused to process which fabric was bunched in her fist.

""Yeah, whatever. Ring it up.""

The woman's eyebrows climbed toward her hairline, but she took the dress without comment. Smart lady.

Her Mantle pulsed under her skin.

The sensation made her stumble mid-step. It felt like someone had hooked jumper cables to her sternum and given them a solid yank.

Not painful, exactly. More like a warning, she didn't have the vocabulary to understand yet.

""That'll be two hundred and forty zens.""

Amelia shoved her credit card at the woman without looking, her other hand still death-gripping the phone.

She found a bench outside a coffee shop and sat, phone clutched in both hands, running through the video call frame by frame in her memory.

His words. ""Stay safe. Stay far away from Vienna. Whatever you hear on the news, don't come back here.""

Whatever you hear on the news.

Her Mantle pulsed again, harder this time. Heat crawled up her spine like someone had poured hot oil down her shirt. She gasped, nearly dropping the phone.

""Miss, are you sure you're okay?"" A different voice, masculine this time. Some guy in running gear looking at her with that do-I-need-to-call-someone expression.

""I'm fine."" The words came out sharp enough to cut. ""Just go away.""

He backed off with his hands raised in surrender.

Amelia pulled up the news on her phone because clearly her day wasn't terrible enough. The front page loaded, and her stomach dropped straight through the bench and into the pavement below.

  
**BREAKING: Communication Blackout in Vienna - Authorities Investigating**

**Unexplained Phenomenon: Dark Veil Surrounds Vienna, Cause Unknown**

**Emergency Services Unable to Reach Vienna - Government Urges Calm**

  
The articles were minutes old. Most were just speculation and panic. But one caught her attention—a live news feed from a helicopter that had been near Vienna when... whatever happened... happened.

Amelia clicked it.

The shaky footage showed Vienna from above. Or rather, showed where Vienna should be.

Instead, there was darkness. Not normal darkness. Not clouds or smoke or even the night sky.

A veil of absolute black that rose from the city's borders like walls made of liquid shadow, stretching up into the atmosphere so high the helicopter couldn't get over it. The footage showed the pilot approaching, then suddenly banking away as if pushed by an invisible force.

The reporter's voice was cracking with barely controlled panic: ""—unprecedented phenomenon—no response from inside the city—authorities have established a perimeter—advising all civilians to—""

Amelia closed the video.

""Idiot."" She said it to the empty air, to the phone that still refused to connect. ""You complete moron.""

She dialed her father, and he picked up on the second ring. ""Dad! The news...""

How to cope and was the relationship doomed to fail? Was I in the wrong? Should I try to get back together with him or keep the breakup? Should I even talk to him today?,"My boyfriend of 15 months that recently formally moved in with me on Dec 3, 2025 after kind of living with me 5 days a week previously from Sept 2025 just left me on Jan 2, 2026 while I was at work. He packed almost all of his belongings including kitchen/household small appliances while I was at work and left me a note saying he needs some space and is staying at his brother's place for now and he didn't want to have an emotional conversation with me and said he only took his personal belonging and left my things there and would message me later once he is settled.
 
I was in shock. Even though we had an argument the day before on Jan 1, 2026 about my feeling a lack of desirability from him due to his lack of intimacy lately by always making excuses to not be intimate (i.e. tired, ate too much, not in mood, promising another day/time that he also doesn't follow thru on, etc.), feeling like he is pulling away (i.e. morning of Jan 1, 2026 he decided to go to condo lounge to talk to his parents/brother and do online job searches even though he always did that in the condo, regardless if I was there or not). We ended up talking about it and I understood his need for space and had given a lot of leeway over the holidays and supported him to talk to his parents/bro daily and multiple times a day and show an interest of how his family was doing. I thought we made up since he made love to me that night (albeit, not exactly like normal) and the morning of Jan 2, 2026, it seemed all normal (i.e. he made me coffee, lunch, kisses/hugs goodbye when I went to work and texted me in afternoon like everything was normal). I came home to an empty house and the short note.
 
When I texted him to ask ""why""  and whether he is breaking up with me. He responded he doesn't want us to hurt each other through arguments and he felt overwhelmed, but was silent on whether this was a breakup. He wouldn't explain why and said he would speak to me on Monday Jan 5, 2026 at 6pm for 20 minutes to explain. Btw, his father in another country just finished having a stent put in his heart after a long wait for it and is in the middle of recovery in the hospital ward. He also recently lost 2 temp jobs that we knew ahead of time was coming.  
 
I responded to his text saying what he did really deeply hurt me, especially after all the support I provided him over our relationship (I didn’t go into lots of details, but background is he has no steady job - 7 temp jobs which he lost of the term of our dating, he is waiting for his temporary Post Graduate Work Permit approval, he is in massive debt to 2 credit cards ($2k), his brother  ($10k) and me ($5k)(i.e. I paid for his last semester of tuition because he didn’t have money and was at risk of losing his status in Canada, groceries when he had no money to eat, passport renewal costs, PGWP costs, ubers, daily expenses, rent to his landlord, etc.). I let him live with me with free room and board and showered him with gifts throughout our relationship (i.e. clothes, shoes, travel trips to Victoria and Halifax, date nights, etc.). I made no recent attempted for repayment as we discussed it 2 months ago when he had work to start payments in the new year on small installments. He had previously promised to pay me back over a year ago, but I wasn’t pushing for repayment back because I knew his situation. We only discussed it 2 months ago because we were planning to live together while he had at the time, steady work.
 
I also texted him what he did was a massive betrayal of my trust and that if he had told me he wanted to move out to stay with brother during this family crisis I would have understood, but the way he left it was not wanting ""space"" because he took his small appliances and looks like a ""permanent"" break. I would have thought having space would be packing some clothes to stay at brothers a couple of days, not taking almost everything with him. I could never trust him again so I told him I was treating this as a breakup instigated by him and that I packed all his remaining things (i.e. old clothes that don’t fit him, shampoo, pot/pan, etc.) and put them in storage and he can pick it up with his brother.
 
His response was that he ""accepted"" I broke up with him and that he didn't want to cause me hurt and pain and understood why I was shocked. He refused to tell me in texts his details of explanation of why he left and said he should have handled that more directly and for me to keep his items in the storage locker and he would pay be back eventually once he has consistent work ( which is likely never going to happen to based on past history). He then wished me peace and the best.
 
I was floored as he was gaslighting me and trying to make himself not feel like the ""bad"" guy so I set him straight with facts that he broke up with me once he packed and moved out the way he did, abandoning me and the relationship and that he knows that what he did was hurtful. I told him I am not keeping his stuff forever and will give him til the end of the month to pick them up (coinciding with his Birthday).
 
He responds to all my texts with sad crying emoji faces.
 
I don't know what to do as he was my whole world and I loved him deeply. He was the longest relationship I had and only my 2nd one. He gave me a promise ring on our anniversary. I know we had ups and downs in the relationship, but we got through them before. This one shocked me to the core and I don't know how to handle functioning at work like normal.
 
I did feel like since he 'formally' moved in with me, he might have felt like he had no place to escape to like he did before for his autonomy. He even casually mentioned he might want to move out and just date me weekly to get his autonomy or move to another province to find better work. I told him that would be a step backwards in the relationship and that it was likely he just felt jitters about leaving his bachelor lifestyle behind. I told him moving to another province would be difficult for a long term relationship and we shouldn't give up on him finding work locally in Ontario (i.e. he had 2 interviews recently for proper jobs).
 
Over the holidays, I had 3 weeks off so spent a lot of time with him and generally enjoyed it doing things with him for Christmas, Boxing Day, my Birthday, NYE (all within 1 week span). We both spend a few days with our respective families separately before the holidays in order to balance our time with them too over the holidays. Both our families (my mom and his brother) do not accept each other and his parents don’t know about me and he refused to tell them about me until after his dad’s surgery recovery. I am 9 years older than he is and not of the same culture or religion as him. I just feel so blindsided I don't know how to handle this and need help. My mum is staying with me a week to handle normal day to day things at home, but I am afraid what is going to happen once she is gone and I am home alone in a space I shared with who I thought was my life partner.
 
I have tried writing down a list of all the negative things about the man that broke my heart, the instances of his failures or disappointments as a life partner to help combat the nice memories I have of him and missing him.
 
I have tried reading reddit posts, but think I need perspective from reddit people on my particular circumstance. I also tried using Google AI to talk to to see if I was wrong and whether it was all my fault and try to understand why he did what he did. These have only helped a little. I’ve realized he was an Avoidant and I am an Anxious when it comes to attachment styles.
 
I took away everything in the condo that reminds me of him and stored them in the locker, including changing the bed sheets where we once made love. It still feels hard as I can 'see' the places of where he 'was' and then miss him in the condo and when I go out to public spaces.
 
It has been 65 hours since my discovery of him abandoning me. I don't know what I should do if he phones me at 6pm today. I told him I am not an appointment or business meeting. I so want to talk to him, but I feel like there is nothing left to say and no explanation that can justify the hurt he did and recover from it for a future relationship with him.
 
I want to not hurt anymore and be able to move on and function again and be happy and not jaded. It took me 20 years to get over my first relationship and have no idea how long this one will take to recover.  I am afraid I will no longer want to love again. I don't want that because I want to have a life partner and feel like I have a lot of love to give. Any advice or perspective from Reddit would be appreciated.

My neighbor is a man in his 60s who constantly comes over to my house to ask for water and rides. 

A little back story, he does not have power and has not had power since April 2025. He has come over daily to ask for water for coffee and rides to the store. At first I didn’t mind at all because times are tough and power bills can get out of hand. As the year went on I wondered why he still hadn’t gotten his power bill paid. I asked him how much he owed and he said 800 dollars and they would turn him back on. I asked if he had applied for general assistance and/or heap, he told me he had but they wouldn’t help him because he has used them too many times. 

It is now January 2026 and his power is still off. He is on a fixed income (disability) and I understand it’s not much but the man has no other bills. He owns his home so there isn’t a rent bill or mortgage payment, his cellphone is a pre paid 40 dollars a month. His property taxes are less than 1000 dollars a year. I can’t understand why in 9 months he hasn’t been able to put any money on his bill whatsoever. When I bring him to the store he buys google play cards for his games on his phone, like a few hundred dollars worth a month. 

It is extremely cold here and the nights get below negative. Another neighbor has done a welfare check on him as cold nights can be very dangerous. I assumed adult protective services would have gotten involved after the police were called and helped with getting him the resources he needs but I don’t know for sure.

He has always creeped me out a bit but our interactions were always pretty short so I just dealt with it because I felt bad for him. Recently he has been trying to push his way into my home and has been trying to “hangout”. I have to tell him I’m leaving in order to get him to leave. My dog absolutely hates this man and barks constantly when he is around. (She doesn’t do this to anyone else) He has also started asking for me to buy him gas for his generator, which I have a couple of times. 

I have tried to be a kind neighbor and helped where I could but it is becoming too much. I feel like I am getting taken advantage of and I am extremely frustrated. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells waiting for this man to show up in the morning. If I am not home he will wait till he sees me pull in and run over before Iv had a chance to get out of my car. 

I have no idea where to go from here. I don’t want to hurt his feelings and I also don’t want to not be helpful but something has to give. I am also not the only neighbor he goes to daily for his basic needs. ",6,1767627251.0,AITAH,7,0.88,False

1q4oprp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1q4oprp/here_is_my_experience_with_a_manipulative/,Here is my experience with a manipulative colleague,"I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat, go to lunch together, or join other colleagues. She would also bring me small homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks—I felt she was a bit like an older sister. At times, she acted childishly around me; for example, one day she ran toward me like a child just to talk, or she would tease me during a conversation. Whenever a workplace meal was organized for a holiday, she insisted that I participate because she knew I don’t usually like work social gatherings. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Occasionally, she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run a few errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then, I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn't speak to anyone at work, focusing on my tasks and trying to get through that difficult period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied: ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance in the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (standing very close to me, pressing her chest against my arm, leaning in very close to speak). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and pressed herself very close to me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and told me she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the final day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong, or why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been harassed and that I had been looking for another job, which I had found. She congratulated me warmly, praising the fact that I was ""comfortable in my job,"" ""funny,"" etc.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, like touching my hand. I told her then that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in contact and meet up for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). She seemed delighted and very excited whenever I contacted her to suggest an outing with the kids, but I noticed she wouldn't inform her husband when we met up. That is why I later suggested family outings with the spouses included. She accepted and organized several outings over the summer, and we saw each other regularly with our respective spouses. I thought our relationship was great. However, sometimes when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that’s not nice."" Yet, she did the same on her end, but frankly, I didn't care. She would offer small dishes and snacks and prepare picnics. She always seemed very motivated. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he didn't invest himself, that he just sat at home drinking coffee, and that he was old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who pursued her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done. When her husband was present, her behavior changed. She became silent, distant, and didn't chat like usual. You could feel she was distant from him. He, on the contrary, seemed very much in love.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine—exceptionally without the spouses—she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very strange. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly bizarre scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and that I preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that strange.

She started organizing outings between the two families herself, booking hotels, and suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home. Outings with the children, like going to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together and stay in a mountain chalet. She also proposed organizing a ""girls' outing"" for herself and my mother at a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble some furniture, which had been planned for weeks, and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up in my car, he said to me during the drive: ""If she wants us to separate, that's no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, nothing... no more news. I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's wishes to her husband, with no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her by text several months later after hearing nothing. I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised information regarding the renovations. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteers)."" She then called me twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""",0,1767627081.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,0.5,False

I felt like my days were just gone before they even started. Like I'd blink and it's 9pm and I barely remember what happened. Turns out this isn't just me being shit at time management (though that's part of it lol). There's actual science behind why time feels like it's slipping through our fingers, and I've spent months reading books, research papers, listening to podcasts to figure out the hack.



The problem is our brains are on autopilot like 90% of the time. When you're scrolling, commuting, doing the same routine, your brain literally doesn't encode new memories because nothing is novel. That's why weeks blur together. But here's the thing, you can actually manipulate your perception of time by understanding how your brain processes it. It's not about cramming more tasks in. It's about designing your day so time expands. 



Time perception is tied to memory formation. When you experience new things, your brain creates more detailed memories, which makes time feel longer in retrospect. This is why childhood summers felt endless but last month is already fuzzy. Dr. David Eagleman (neuroscientist at Stanford) talks about this extensively. The more novel experiences you have, the ""thicker"" your memory of that time period becomes.



So the first shift is introducing micro novelty into your daily routine. I'm not saying quit your job and backpack through Asia (though that would work). I mean take a different route to work. Try a new coffee shop. Rearrange your desk. Listen to a genre of music you've never explored. Read during lunch instead of scrolling. Your brain suddenly has to pay attention again because it can't predict what's coming. These tiny interruptions to autopilot make your days feel more substantial.



The other massive factor is attention residue. When you switch between tasks without completing them, part of your attention stays stuck on the previous thing. So you're never fully present, which makes time feel chaotic and compressed. Cal Newport wrote about this in Deep Work (guy's a computer science professor at Georgetown, book sold over a million copies and honestly changed how I think about focus). He breaks down why our fragmented attention is killing both our productivity and our sense of time. The book is dense with research but stupidly practical. Like you'll finish it and immediately want to redesign your entire work setup.



What actually works is time blocking with single focus periods. Instead of ""I'll work on this project today,"" you schedule 90 minute blocks for ONE thing. No phone, no email, no Slack. Just that task. The Pomodoro technique is baby version of this but honestly for deep work you need longer stretches.

My family and I just returned from visiting the Ann Arbor area from South Carolina, as my husband has a job offer in Canton. In considering a move, I would love recommendations from locals on best places to live!

A little bit about us - late 30s with 7 year old twins, liberal, outdoorsy, laid back, and we have around a 650k budget. We currently live in a neighborhood where lots of kids play outside together and we are able to walk/bike to several things (their school, coffee shops, grocery store, playgrounds) and would like to continue to have that type of environment if possible. With young children, schools are an important factor. If we were to relocate, I would likely be working at UM or another research-focused institution. 

We stayed in Plymouth and spent some time in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Saline, Northville, Canton, and Detroit. From initial impressions, Ann Arbor, Ypsi, and Plymouth all seemed to be our vibe. Northville (at least the small part we visited) seemed a bit too bougie for us, and Saline and Canton a bit lackluster. We unfortunately did not have a ton of time in Detroit, but are definitely open to the area.

I would deeply appreciate to hear y'alls recommendations on areas that may be a good fit for us! Thank you for sharing your input!!

1q4oo77,https://i.redd.it/a72y4vgjujbg1.jpeg,Coffee in the Philippines did not begin as a Filipino-owned business.,"In 1740, a Spanish Franciscan friar planted the first coffee tree in Lipa, Batangas, introducing what would later become one of the country’s most iconic crops. A lesser-known detail is how early Filipino farmers protected their harvest. 

They planted Akasya (Acacia) trees to provide natural shade and used red ants (Hantik) as living pest control, allowing the ants to eat insects that damaged the coffee cherries. 

This made early Philippine coffee one of the first examples of organic and biological farming systems in Asia, long before such practices became global trends.

#PhilippineCoffee #CoffeeHistory #OrganicFarming #Batangas

Hindi nagsimula bilang negosyong Pilipino ang kape sa Pilipinas.

Noong 1740, isang paring Pransiskano na Kastila ang nagtanim ng unang puno ng kape sa Lipa, Batangas. Ang hindi gaanong alam ng marami ay ang paraan ng mga sinaunang magsasakang Pilipino sa pagprotekta ng kanilang ani.

Gumamit sila ng mga punong Akasya bilang natural na lilim at ng mga pulang langgam o Hantik bilang likas na panlaban sa peste, dahil kinakain ng mga ito ang mga insektong sumisira sa bunga ng kape. 

Dahil dito, ang maagang industriya ng kape sa Pilipinas ay isa sa mga unang halimbawa ng organik at biyolohikal na pagsasaka sa Asya, bago pa ito naging uso sa buong mundo.",2,1767626982.0,OldSchoolPH,0,1.0,False

As I detailed in earlier posts, I am embarking on a long series of 10-day streaks to improve my health habits. 

I was so fit and active for most of my adult life but somehow fell apart badly over the past couple of years. I'm finding that tiny steps are the best path forward for me. If I follow through, I should be in awesome shape for my 50th birthday next year.



I had a series of 4 successful streaks in a row:

42 days: Turn phone off by 9PM

32 days: Limit alcohol to maximum of 2 beers/week

22 days: 6:30AM (or upon waking) – applesauce and water BEFORE coffee

12 days: Take prescriptions and supplements on schedule

 

My fifth streak was supposed to be a daily foot/ankle/calf mobility program, but I didn't make time for it on Day 3, got frustrated, and broke 2 of my other streaks since ""I ruined it anyway."" The worst thing I did was stay up late scrolling on my phone Friday and Saturday nights. 

The good news pieces are: (1) I didn't have any alcohol; (2) it was only 2 days; and (3) I learned a lot and have a plan going forward.

  
I am trying to pick habits that barely feel like an effort so that I can sustain this for a year. I am realizing that even a very modest 15-minute activity felt like pressure to me. I'm having an easier time with dropping bad habits than picking up new activities. So I'm dropping the foot rehab program as a daily obligation. 

Instead, my 5th streak, starting today, is to refrain from using my phone from 6am-9am other than to check text messages no more than once per hour.

I’ve been working here since June and work full time 6:30am-4:00pm 4 days a week. I‘m the only full time barista and have the most experience. My boss had no experience owning a business or in being a barista before this cafe and I had to help out a it with drink recipes and getting things organized. A few months ago I had a sort of breakdown because my boss puts weird responsibilities or other things on me because of her own stress. For example, I had a few doctors appointments because I have epilepsy. In a meeting she told me that if I don’t work more ( I couldnt work because of my appointments…) they would go bankrupt and they’ve put everything they have into the cafe. Or telling me things like her mother, who works at the shop, is almost 70 and she can’t do everything! implying that I make her mom do everything for me (her mom works in the kitchen and I work in the front as a barista… I often help in the back when I can). Idk my boss just says a lot of things that are putting her own stress onto me and makes me stressed. she also told me 3 months ago I could probably get a raise but I havent because shes stressed about not making enough at the cafe

my epilepsy is triggered mostly by stress and I try to keep my stress levels lower but that’s a bit hard to do...

I am 22 and haven’t graduated college due to needing to finish an internship but I can’t because of my epilepsy :/

there is an opening at a brand new higher end hotel in as a laundry attendant. My husband actually set up phones in the new hotel and said it’s very nice and clean and even saw the laundry room which is the same. Im fairly interested in the job as it’s mostly just sorting, organizing, and doing laundry. No talking to people really. I would have to take the bus for 22 minutes or so (my job now is only a 3 minute walk). I just don’t know if I should apply or not… my boss will be upset if I leave… what if I end up not liking the laundry job… Idk Im unsure. I think there is a possibility to work at both as the laundry job might be full time one week and a few days the next week and so on (theres not much info on the job).

my prior job experience has been (in order of most recent):

\- 2 years as a barista at my college coffee shop (one person shop)

\- 3 years as a housekeeper at my college (cleaning bathrooms and a few other things… I actually enjoyed this besides all the bathroom cleaning chemicals)  
\- 6 months as a cookie decorator/dishwasher  
\- 2 years as a barista/“cook“ at a drive through shop  
\- summer as a social media manager and photographer at a camp

\- 2 years fast food server/fry cook in college

idk I just feel like im getting burnt out at this job. I go to bed at like 9:30 every night and still wake up tired. I dont feel like doing things with friends since Im peopled out all the time.

Not the drama. Not the theory. Just *wholesome polyamory*.

For me, healthy poly isn’t loud or complicated. It’s the quiet, practical “I’ve got you” stuff:

* Checking a partner’s gas because being stranded is stressful
* Letting go of the mutiny that takes place when your partner turns on you during a NERF battle and sides with the kids (I'm still sour about how often this happens at our house lol)
* Making sure their car isn’t a rolling anxiety factory
* A gentle “you good on money this week?” check—support, not control
* Food, coffee, meds, or reminders showing up without a meeting about it
* Love that feels steady instead of urgent

Somewhere along the way, my poly life shifted from chaos and constant emotional triage to something calmer and more grounding.

Less *relationship discourse*, more *“did you eat and are your tires okay?”*

So in the spirit of starting the year on a better note:  
**What are your wholesome poly wins—or the small everyday things you or your partners do that make polyamory feel genuinely good for you?**

I hesitated.,"Me and my wife have been together for 6 years, married for 3. We met at a friend's birthday party and I spilled beer on her dress trying to be smooth. She still brings it up. We were that couple for a while. 

About 3 years ago I started a company. She was my biggest supporter. She believed in it before I did honestly. She'd stay up with me when I was stressed, bring me food when I forgot to eat, talk me off the ledge when things got bad. She used to say ""I'm investing in you"" whenever I felt guilty about how much time I was spending on it.

I don't know when things changed. It wasn't one moment. I just slowly disappeared I guess.

Last month we were on the couch. She was watching The Bear, her third rewatch, she loves that show. I was on my laptop doing work stuff, refreshing my email every 30 seconds waiting on someone who's probably never going to respond.

She paused it. I didn't notice for like 10 seconds.

""Do you even want to be here right now?""

I looked up. She was crying. I have no idea how long she'd been crying.

She said she feels like she's living with my LinkedIn profile. She said her sister was pregnant and she'd told me two weeks before that and I said ""that's great"" and then asked where my charger was. I don't remember that conversation but I believe her.

She said there's a guy at work who keeps asking her to get coffee. She's said no every time, but she's thought about saying yes just because ""he asks how I'm doing and actually waits for the answer.""

Idk man that one fucked me up.

We talked until almost 3am. I found out her best friend was getting divorced, had been going on for over a month. She'd had a weird mole removed the week before, didn't tell me about the appointment because she figured I wouldn't remember anyway. She'd gotten promoted back in October. 

I asked why she didn't tell me any of this.

She said ""I did. You just weren't listening.""

She made me coffee the next morning without me asking. She hadn't done that in months. I almost lost it over a cup of coffee like a psycho.

I blocked off my evenings after that. No work after 7. I've had to reschedule things but I've been doing it.

I don't really know why I'm posting this. I guess I just needed to say it somewhere. She was my biggest supporter for 3 years and I repaid her by disappearing. She was grieving me while I was sitting right next to her.

It's been a month. The evenings are still blocked. We watched The Bear together last week - the whole episode. I didn't check my phone once.

So back to the test. The first one was 250/15 ratio with water at boiling. Add coffee stir let sit for 2 minutes, break up the crust and drain.

I want to challenge myself to make the drive all the way down from Olympia, WA area, so 3+ hours one way. I have never done solo travels before, as well as big drives, but have been to the Oregon Coast plenty growing up so I am familiar with some of the beaches. My main focus is on Oceanside and Agate/Tunnel beach for some good Ole rock hounding. 

I want to leave at 3 or 4am and arrive around 7 to 8am. I pick Sat, January 24th as that day has a decent early day low tide. 

What is the Coast like this time of year traffic/busyness wise? 

Any road closures or washouts/flooding that can pose a risk? I

Plenty of agates this time of year? I'm thinking with winter storms and the recent king tide.

How is parking earlier mornings? 

Will I be safe traveling the Coast as a young solo female? 

Bonus: Any must stop at coffee spots? I wanna hit up Blue Agate Cafe in Oceanside for breakfast and then Mo's Seafood in Cannon Beach area for lunch/dinner. 

I have a reliable car, I'll air uo tires, add oil. Share my location with my husband, pack a first aid kit, spare clothes +shoes, coat , headlamp, blanket and some snacks. Ive got my routes picked out. Am I ready? I am quite excited",4,1767626175.0,OregonCoast,13,0.75,False

It’s been a banner year for viral workplace trends. From “coffee badging” to “quiet promotions,” the post-pandemic workplace has seen a tumultuous evolution in 2025.

As 2026 dawns, there is a new workplace trend on the horizon, one that’s apparently being embraced by bosses looking to lure workers back to the office. As return-to-office mandates continue to see mixed results, some bosses are reportedly turning to subtler tactics to get employees back.

The strategy is what’s known as “hybrid creep.” The idea, according to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/hybrid-work-return-to-office-creep-af5a62b5?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdPjkz69a8soVYdcdwBVZ3jX4kyQCGoW1lobNBMMf2zmPsnI5nEtK4FNYr8IPY%3D&gaa_ts=695bd8ca&gaa_sig=dRjpbV0zHTxy32wM9X8MTGZ6_CGpA4rahihjKJtgSa5tlpeHaKx8hrB7Esr99R2qXM89QrCWKXb0vpktWzb92w%3D%3D), is “that a combination of carrots and sticks will encourage people to gradually increase their in-office time without explicitly telling them to do so.”

One of the key tactics behind the strategy, the WSJ says, is to tie promotions to office attendance. Along with the “carrot” of a possible promotion, bosses are reportedly using the “stick” of surveillance, in the hopes that “the specter of Big Brother will improve compliance with existing policies,” the WSJ adds.

Working in employers’ favor is a job market that’s relatively stagnant compared to the immediate post-pandemic hiring surge of a few years ago, when workers could call the shots. Now, it’s employers who are effectively in the pole position as the threat of layoffs and AI replacement looms in the background.

“We’re in a climate where people are afraid of losing their jobs,” HR consultant Jaye Johnson said, speaking to the WSJ. “So, if there’s an office nearby, I’m going to be there whether I want to or not.”

Workers are reportedly taking the cue. According to the Journal, office attendance is ticking up and work-from-home Mondays and Fridays are gradually dissolving at many workplaces.

The WSJ cites figures from commercial real-estate firm JLL which indicates that attendance rates on Mondays and Fridays are no more or less on par with Wednesdays, which have long been the most common in-office days.

Even more notable, according to the Journal, is that some people are returning to the office, not because they have to, but because they actually missed it.",9,1767626100.0,remotework,1,1.0,False

1q4o8nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriousUniverse/comments/1q4o8nf/i_have_disembarked_the_mu_ship_of_theseus/,I have disembarked the MU ship of Theseus,"Long post, sorry, but it gets all my thoughts out and a few things off my chest.

I was worried that in my earlier posts I was being harsh and perhaps not justified in having an opinion at all as I was 99.9% likely going to stop listening whoever took over due to being burned out with this genre. There’s no “I want to believe” \[in the new hosts\] factor in this for me.

But I was still paying into their era and have invested a lot over the years into what they inherited. But having listened to the early part of the one episode I didn’t listen to before (MU+ 32.25) and only listening to hear the bit others have referred to (from 8m45s), I concluded I wasn’t harsh. The tone of this post has been greatly influenced by hearing that moment.

I didn’t like the blatant sneering and condescending tone in response to opinions about the excessive swearing in first show and then the other guy “I’ll save you some f’ing finger dexterity and say the only three opinions I care about are Joe’s, Aaron’s and Ben’s”. What an obnoxious pair. My first instinct when they began was that I didn’t warm to them. Now it’s a case of - I very much dislike them. They seemingly have no redeeming qualities.

Being hired and immediately being hostile to a section of the audience (probably a larger % than they imagine) – “It’s a bold strategy, Cotton, let’s see if it pays off for ‘em”. They want constructive criticism? I’d say those not wanting the podcast to turn into something trashy are being constructive. They attack the complainers but then instantly implied it is constructive by saying they’ll tone it down. They are not very smart.

I am willing to bet a good % of the listeners were thinking on hearing heir first cobbled together show “tone the swearing down a bit, guys”. But the hosts are seemingly too dim and just assumed it was a vocal minority with the opinion. Brandon Thomas seems obsessed with expanding his expansive expanded expansions. The repeated use of such words makes the man come across as a fool – someone wanting to appear a deeper thinker than he is. And then there’s his God forsaken non-selling books (12 published in 23 months) where half the reviews are written by himself. MU has clearly not been placed in a safe pair of hands. He seems like a man in search of the perfect grift. Must be great for his ego getting this show. But when it all fails, he’ll want to forget it ever happened. I get a sense they think the audience is destined to stay because it’s MU. If they think they have inherited continued success they must be very naïve.

It's not very smart attacking the audience (whatever the perceived size of a section of it) the moment they get the job – the very time listeners are not invested in their tenure are going to be more likely to see more of what they perceive as flaws. It’s as if they listened to Ben and Aaron’s last show about how they were attacked by some people in the past but carried on regardless, and these two thought they can do just the same from day one to a larger number. Their tone will have also influenced the first impressions of those who don't feel personally attacked. As I said, they are not very smart.

They don’t understand human nature. Some listeners don’t like some opinions of Ben and Aaron but have remained listeners because they don’t want to “throw the baby out with the bath water” and so they are willing to see past the things they perceive as flaws. Brandon and Joe appear to believe, based on their attitude, think that they can just stroll in and inherit the “elbow room” earned by Ben and Aaron.

**The future of MU (or lack of)**

Not that we will ever know the numbers, but the audience will significantly drop. Especially after the initial curiosity value abruptly fades/ed – and the end of the last season and the turning of the year. When they said in MU+ 32.25 “I’ll save you some f’ing finger dexterity and say the only three opinions I care about are Joe’s, Aaron’s and Ben’s”, they are still in this early phase; any impact won’t be obvious by then. I can almost imagine them sounding more pleasant in the new year if the numbers are going off a cliff.

I care about Ben and Aaron’s eventual opinion when they decide to fire Brandon and Joe because they drove the show into a ditch.

Ben and Aaron, did I hear your own new host admit in MU+ 32.24 at 8:30 that his old podcast was going nowhere after nearly 5 years effort and he got a job selling bedding plants? Why did you hire someone who clearly isn't the calibre needed to take over?

As soon as Ben and Aaron announced the end of their era I thought it could be a poisoned chalice and it’s not going to end well.

**Perpetual decline**

I have no idea about algorithms in the podcast sphere but having a hobby as a pound-shop Youtube guru, MU with a dwindling audience is going to slowly become harder to find for potential new listeners. Do these guys have the retention power of Ben and Aaron? (don’t laugh). If not, they are destined to lose more listeners than they gain. MU is going to become overgrown by algorithmic weeds and just be one of countless other “just another podcasts”.

Logically, what will probably happen is that the audience numbers will go down to whatever their level is. But what level? Well, the one guy at least has a failed podcast. As soon as they find their level – the line will probably flatten. But how low will the audience be then? Will the show have been unceremoniously axed by then because it’s not financially viable? 

Listeners one by one will now be drifting away and increasingly won’t be replaced by new ones due to the algo weeds growing and because MU is now basically “just another podcast” hosted by “a couple of random guys”.

MU is like a house many of us have helped build. It felt like Brandon and Joe came in and plonked themselves down on the sofa and put their muddy boots up on the coffee table and then snarled in the faces of those who frowned in response.

**Planning to fail?**

I think Ben and Aaron are expecting this era to fail. They know *they* are MU.

What feels like Ben and Aaron’s hands-off approach and the poor choice of replacements and letting them get on with it and no attempt to transition-in properly, and the fact they seemingly just went with a pair who had the MP3 of a duo interacting, half convinces me that they have done all this believing Brandon and Joe are going to fail and that it would have been more hassle to get strangers working well together. Maybe the number of applicants was limited or their calibre just wasn't very good overall? They should have hired someone to find new hosts. Have Ben and Aaron even paid them enough or done it on the cheap? Which won't be cheap if the podcast goes out of business.

If the hosts read this or others’ critical posts, I wouldn’t worry. If they believe in themselves as Ben and Aaron \[possibly\] do, then obviously it’s just a few outlying opinions if they can confidently be discounted with hostility on their third show without concern that they might have also attacked a sizeable section of their audience who share the opinions at the very time they need to most make them warm to them? They will know critics are wrong and can comfort themselves by looking at their analytics in the coming months.

My Plus sub ended on Christmas day, and I have removed the Brandon and Joe episodes from my MU archive. They don’t belong there.

What a shame the show couldn’t have ended nicely.

I worry that even my opinions now might be playing a part in tarnishing the fondness I have for MU. If Ben and Aaron start their new show next month and basically say “F you” to those of us who don’t like the new MU, will I feel personally attacked by them, and then the entire archive and the countless hours of enjoyment I spent listening to them won’t be quite the same?

The positive thing, if the new hosts fail, Ben and Aaron will have taken a large amount of their audience with them and even if MU ceased entirely for a while, it could be fired back up with new hosts and if they were good, they would succeed.

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

Our friendship was at its best when we were teenagers and then grew a bit distant when we went to University. However we still see each other 3 or 4 times a year.

Evelyn has always struggled in life: emotionally (cause she was adopted and treated like Cinderella) and on top of that she has a lot of health issues (kidney failure, diabetes and endometriosis).

So, since always I have treated her with nice presents on every special ocassion. She usually would get me cheap presents due to her not doing well economically (another problem of hers, in her younger years at least) which I understand. However, she has been more comfortable economically in the later years, she has become addicted to concerts and she has been going to concerts like crazy, paying reseller prices, so that's not cheap at all. She has given pricy gifts to her family (that's totally fine, such a nice gesture).

BUT, here comes: my flower pots. For my previous birthday she asked what a wanted as a gift and I sent her a link from Amazon for a set of 3 flower pots, not very expensive, they were around 25 USD. On my side, I got her a very special edition of Harry Potter's 2nd book (she already had the first one), it costed around 45 USD.

When we saw each other on later months (hers and my birthday had already passed) she gave me a suspicious perfume (it was obviously not original and refilled who the hell knows where) and a cheap poliester pijamas, she has never seen me wearing perfume btw (many perfumes trigger headaches for me so I avoid them).

And let's go back a little: in the months we didn't see each other she told me she hadn't received the flower pots yet, then she said she had them, then when we finally met she said her mom broke them by accident so I could forget about them. I don't believe any of that, the flower pots were made of thick plastic, I bet she thought they were other material because she didn't even order them in the first place!

I gave her the pretty book and that was it. By the way, during that meal she told me about a guy she was seeing (on the side) on Starbucks everyday. So she also has money for those crappy expensive coffees while she cheats on the guy that gave her his kidney.

So... I'm super pissed at her on regards the presents stuff. It's like she has money for many things and many people except for me and my damned flower pots.

Now, to the present: She has sent me twice a message about Christmas presents, something like ""here are my shoes 👠👠 make sure you put them under your tree and let's see what Santa has for me"" I have just ignored those messages and responded her other texts.

I’m a mid 30s, first time mum. I’ve always lived a very sociable life, out every weekend and attending every house party, gig and festival. 

I knew having a baby would change things and quite honestly I welcomed that change. After 10 years of going out all the time I was looking forward to a slower, more solitary pace. I was also very aware I’d loose friendships, especially when a lot of my friends don’t have or want kids. 

Now that time of my life is here, and after a rough pregnancy, I enjoy it. I love a solo coffee date with my child and quiet weekends at home as a family. 

However, like many parents, postpartum isolation has hit hard. Invites for coffee or quick check ins to see how I am have stopped. Even from friends who do have kids, I know they’re all busy! My closest friends barely reach out anymore, and if they do it’s always a very last minute invite, obviously an afterthought. 

It’s clear new WhatsApp groups have been formed that I’m not in, which has never bothered me, until now. Feels even more isolating. Especially when they talk about new plans that I’m not invited to, on the rare occasions I do socialise. 

I’ve always felt like I’m the one who reaches out to friends for a coffee and a catch up, even pre pregnancy it’s something I struggled with. I was always invited to group events but almost never received a text seeing if I wanted a drink or a catch up, away from the masses.

To try and remedy the situation I’ve sent multiple texts and had a number of conversations over the years about arranging a catch up, but the majority have never come to fruition. It’s either been a last minute cancel or just point blank ignoring my messages. When I’ve tried to sort something in person, it’s always met with “oh yes, let me check my diary” and again nothing ever happens. 

I’ve struggled with this mentally for years and it’s part of the reason I cut back on drinking as I’d get so upset on my return home. 

I’ve always navigated changes in friendships to the best of my ability, of course they come and go. Nothing stays the same. But this shift has hurt more than any other. 

Sadly, my closest, oldest friends live far away, almost unreachable now I’m a mum. I feel stuck. 

I’m not sure I’m strong enough to continue along this path, but moving on seems quite severe and even more isolating. 

Has anyone else navigated this before?

I’ve also watched every single YouTube review and shorts because I was so excited, I’m sure I’m not the only one.

I’m aware there’s a lot of frustration, worry, anger etc. on this thread. I’ve contemplated on writing a review as there’s so much to cover.

Decided to just write about my daily usage and what I love about them. I’ll leave out the improvement suggestions in this one, perhaps once more people get theirs. 

**What LOOKS COOL about them**

- The ring looks awesome, the sheen, the colour, the shape. It’s an accessory
- The glasses make me look smart and mature for my age and line of work, 36 year old project manager and I deal with both clients and suppliers (I actually spent $4,000 for ICL eye surgery and now I’m back on non-prescription glasses on the daily LOL)
- The clip on sunglasses are killer too, I just feel so good wearing them out for a coffee run last weekend

**The Day Begins**

The R1s are on my right index finger all the time except for charging during dinner time, weight lifting and drying my hands. I’ve set them to standard performance mode.

After I wash up, I pick the fully charged glasses out of the case and start using them. I also check on my sleep data on the Even app. I had the best sleep of the year last night. I check my HRV and am reminded to take some deep long breaths.

Head down for breakfast, I scroll through some news while walking down the stairs, check my daily schedule and appointments, review and add some tasks onto my quick list. Look at the date and time and tell myself “it’s 5th of January, 8am”.

Having breakfast with my family, the G2s are passive, I enjoy a normal breakfast. As I’m done and about to head out, I double tap the R1 ring and bring the dashboard on to check the time and go through everything again. I seem to do this multiple times a day.

I get in the car, and set the screen distance to far. I put on the sun clips. I recall I’m short on coffee beans. Hey Even. Remind me to buy some coffee beans. Double tap to close the dashboard.

I’m at a traffic light, it’s red. Double tap, tap, some news about the Narwal vacuum robot, seems like an ad. Oh it can detect socks on the floor and send you an image. Ok cool. Ok light’s green. Double tap. Double tap. Dashboard off.

Arrive at office, going up the stairs. Colleague gives compliment on glasses (I’ve not worn glasses after my ICL surgery 6 years ago). I get to my desk and set the display distance to near. Double tap. I scroll to my quick list. My settings are that the display doesn’t auto disappear unless I double tap. The quick list is in front of me. I look down at my laptop and immediately get distracted by the stream of information coming in. ADHD is kicking in. I glance up to my quick list and a reminder of the task at hand. It pulls me back on track. Tap. I tick it off the list. Next task.

Done with my tasks. Off to my client meeting. Navigate is useless for car navigation. I bring up the dashboard while walking to my car, akin to bringing your wrist watch up and glancing at the time. Double tap.

I meet my client and start conversate discreetly. I pay attention to the conversation and let conversate take notes in the background. I’ve got suggestions popping up but it’s not in my focus. My focus is still on my client and I understand everything he is saying. I end the meeting then review the conversate summary in my car. Pretty good.

Had another meeting where I didn’t have to use conversate as it was very casual. Back to office and double tap, quick list always on again.

Done with work, I drive home. Bring up the dashboard while walking to check on the time and quick list.

If you can't open, here is the full article below. Three more to follow this month.

**By** [**Pete Wells**](https://cooking.nytimes.com/author/pete-wells)

A reporter for the Food section, Pete Wells was The Times’s chief restaurant critic for 12 years.

***Reset Your Appetite*** *This is the first of four articles by Pete Wells, appearing each Monday in January, about how he created healthier eating habits.*

Published Jan. 5, 2026 Updated Jan. 5, 2026

Amazon lists more than 70,000 diet books. Not a single one is called “Eat Like a Restaurant Critic.”

That line of work, [which was mine from 2012 until 2024](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/dining/pete-wells-steps-down-food-critic.html), gave me many rewards, but an easy glide path to health was not one of them. By my last year on the job, I was a mess. I creaked and groaned and belched like a tractor. Heaving myself out of the back seat of a car took so much effort that I dreamed about a portable winch. I waddled to the bathroom four or five times a night, between bouts of heartburn. I woke up with headaches, a mouth as dry as an emery board and a heavy coating of fatigue that I could never shake.

With each new complaint, I thought: So this is life after 60. I continued to believe this until a doctor sent me a series of numbers preceded by the words blood pressure, weight, body mass index, triglycerides, blood sugar. The numbers were large, he said. Taken together with my physical complaints, they pointed to prediabetes, fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea, acid reflux and obesity.

The prospect of diabetes scared me the most. Above all, it’s what drove me to ask for another job at The Times and to teach myself how to eat again.

Almost two years later, with no medication except a daily blood-pressure pill, almost all of those conditions have receded to less scary levels, although the cholesterol in my blood is putting up a fight. Today, I am about 55 pounds lighter than I was at my zenith, a loss roughly equivalent to dropping an entire male basset hound.

Slimming down was not my main purpose. I never counted a single calorie. Somehow, that took care of itself because of the new ways I started shopping, cooking and eating back then and have more or less stuck to since.

Although the way I used to feed myself was unconventional, the results of my years-long binge are all too typical. More than two out of five people in the United States have obesity. A third are prediabetic. [One in 10 has Type 2 diabetes itself](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html). Genes and other factors can play a role in these conditions, but the root problem for millions of us is that we have stopped eating sensibly. We stuff our stomachs with far more food than we need. No wonder [about 12 percent of American adults](https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx) say they have tried one of the GLP-1 medications for weight loss.

I’m no expert on nutrition. On the subject of overeating, though, my credentials are hard to beat. In my long climb out of the deep pit I dug myself into, I’ve come to understand a few things about how I got there. As I’ve tried to build a healthier relationship with food, I’ve also learned a bit about the ways our bodies and minds work.

Each Monday for the next four weeks, I’ll lay out some of the insights that helped me, and some recipes that reflect how I eat at home these days. By describing how I learned to eat a more balanced diet, I do not mean to suggest that you will have the same luck with my routine, or that you should even try. I needed to control sugar, cholesterol and overeating in general. I didn’t worry, though, about sodium and potassium, which would be major concerns for somebody with kidney disease. Obviously, anyone with a specific health issue should get advice from a doctor.

 My assumption is that, like me, a lot of people simply want to eat less of the stuff we know we’re supposed to avoid and more of the stuff that’s better for us. These are not nutritional guidelines but general principles on how to behave more sensibly in the presence of food.

The behavioral approach has become a dominant school of thought in mainstream nutrition as it’s become clear that the mind-set that reduces the challenges of dieting to mere math — otherwise known as “calories in, calories out” — gets most people nowhere. Eating is, after all, a behavior. We learn how to do it, and we can unlearn our habits if there turns out to be a better way.

Break Up With Sugar

The first thing I set out to do when I left the doctor’s office was to hunt for simple carbohydrates to cut out of the meals I ate at home. At the time, all I cared about was reversing my slow slide into diabetic territory. What I didn’t know was that the sugar in simple carbohydrates had been driving my need to keep eating, and that reducing my intake would help reset my appetite.

Even I was surprised by how many simple carbs I was eating. There were English muffins with plum jam I made myself. The teaspoons of sugar, which towered higher and higher as time went on, in each of the four cups of coffee after waking up. Brown sugar in oatmeal, wildflower honey on buttered toast, Vermont maple syrup on waffles. Orange, pineapple, grapefruit juice. Croissants, cardamom buns, blueberry muffins, cider doughnuts. Cumulus heaps of white rice at lunch, hunk after hunk of bread with dinner. Cookies to stave off the afternoon naps, which usually came anyway.

This is a partial list.

Five months into my sugar reset, I got an email from my doctor containing a lovely, lyrical phrase: “You are no longer prediabetic.”

By then I had lost more than 20 pounds, too, but resetting my simple carbohydrate base line had ripple effects throughout my life. The less sugar I ate, the easier it was to eat less of everything else. I was no longer strapped into what nutritionists call the glucose roller coaster, the cycle of sugar highs and deep lows that can lead to insulin resistance, wrecking the body’s ability to regulate hunger.

In the United States, and increasingly around the world, supermarkets and chain restaurants are packed with roller-coaster foods that promise ever-more intense flavors and pleasures, but only leave us wanting more.

“We’re supposed to feel satiated and full, and we don’t,” said Ashley Gearhardt, a psychologist at the University of Michigan who studies compulsive eating. “We’re being tricked.”

As I ate less added sugar and replaced refined grains with whole ones, my appetite shrank, and my howling desires for sweet stuff became quieter, easier to ignore. I had more energy and seemed to think clearly again for the first time in years. I had unleashed forces that would make it easier to put in place all the other changes I’ll cover in the next few weeks.

“Basically, you were eating less of foods that encouraged you to overeat and more of foods that don’t do that,” said [Marion Nestle,](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/well/marion-nestle-nutrition-food-profile.html) an emerita professor of food, nutrition and public health at New York University. “Pretty much what any sensible nutritionist would advise.”

Shift Out of Overdrive

Nutritionists say that a great many people eat more added sugar than they should. A starting point is to figure out whether you’re getting more than 10 percent of your total calories from added sugar, which should be the maximum intake, according to the federal government’s [Dietary Guidelines for Americans.](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials) (Unlike protein, fat and vitamins, added sugar isn’t necessary to our bodies, so there is no recommended minimum amount, just a maximum.)

For the past five years, nutrition labels on packaged foods have been required to list the amount of added sugars. They can travel under many aliases, including some that sound harmless and maybe even wholesome: evaporated cane juice, agave nectar, fruit juice concentrate and brown rice syrup.

For me and for many people, there’s little reason to worry about the sugars naturally found in fruits and vegetables, where they are packaged with other things that help you feel full sooner and slow down the absorption of glucose into the blood. Sweet potatoes are called sweet potatoes for a reason, but I don’t think twice about eating one for dinner because they’re fairly gentle on the blood sugar, especially when boiled and served in their skins.

I might as well admit that chief among the “other things” that help you feel full are what nutritionists insist on calling fiber, a word so off-putting that it makes me want to seek solace in the arms of the nearest cinnamon bun. Luckily, when it comes to simple carbs like rice and flour, we can use the less lumpish phrase “whole grains” to describe the same general idea. And this is what to look for if you find you eat too much white rice and white bread. Whole grains happen to have more flavor, too.

This is the heart of my first reset: eating carbohydrates in their original, sturdy, crunchy, complicated forms. I knew it would be better for me. And having raised two boys, I probably should have known that going through sugar overdrive many times a day was not producing the most rational behavior.

Matched with a 29 F Ukranian lady on dating app, she initiated the first date and suggested we go bowling, I met her there for the first time played some darts, 2 drinks and bowling after was a casual very first date, I didn't feel she was looking for anything at that point, just got to know each other and some small talk, After this I did not initiate any convo with her for about 2 weeks.

Then she wished me for christmas, and I wished back. My friend said to ask for another date, I thought fine what could go wrong atleast it's practice.

2nd Date:

\- Took her out to a traditional celtic music show and dinner. No room for much convo there as it was fairly noisy. But we had a great time. I could sense that she was much more open then last time.

\- After the show went out for 2 more drinks, she was tired as she was straight out of work and had a early work day the next. Walked her to the bus stop and realized her phone was almost dead. So I called in and paid for a cab, and also bought a small perfume for her like a christmas present. I never saw that big of a glow and excitement till then and gave me a big goodbye hug. She said she had a great time and thanked me for the present again.

1 more week of nothing goes by, I decided to wish her for new years, and in the process asked her if she's upto another small coffee brunch and walk in the park, she sugested we go to the zoo and she sent of video on tik tok of the place, I was like fine.

Till that point never cared to look her socials up, and then I got wind of her tik tok profile, where she puts videos of her work (Hair dressing/extension) and the other part lifestyle type videos, and they're mostly about money expensive things and how she excpects her man to look after her and buy expensive gifts. (They're mostly in russian) so i don't really get if she's being sarcastic or serious, using google translate can be a hit or a miss.

She also says that she wants to find love and is actively dating, she put a video about our last date on her tik tok and how surprised she was, how much of a gentle man and a green flag I was.

At this stage Im honestly confused, if she's looking for sugar daddy's to take her out (she's been going out with multiple guys in between and most of them were duds is what she says )

Need advice on is it worth pursuing this lady? is slowly warming up to me? or am I getting trolled here. Now that I know what she's upto I'd like to meet here one last time and make up my mind if this is worth it.

Fruit-heavy blends tasted great but turned into snack triggers, not meals. Once I realized protein was the missing piece, I went looking for options that actually *kept me full*. That’s how I landed on the **7 Best High-Protein Smoothies for Weight Loss** and decided to test them in real life.

I didn’t do a cleanse or replace every meal. I used these smoothies mostly for breakfast and sometimes as a late lunch on busy days. The difference was noticeable almost immediately. With enough protein, my energy stayed steady and I wasn’t prowling the kitchen mid-morning.

Here’s what stood out as I worked through the **7 Best High-Protein Smoothies for Weight Loss**:

* **Fullness lasted longer.** Protein + fiber made a huge difference.
* **Fewer cravings.** I stopped thinking about snacks all morning.
* **Better texture.** Thicker smoothies felt like meals, not drinks.
* **Simple swaps.** Easy to replace cereal, pastries, or sugary coffee drinks.

What didn’t work? Skipping protein or “freestyling” too much. Every time I leaned back into mostly fruit, hunger came roaring back. Following the structure of the **7 Best High-Protein Smoothies for Weight Loss** mattered more than creativity. Timing helped too—mornings or post-workout were best; late-night smoothies didn’t feel as useful.

I followed this guide for the recipes and context: [**7 Best High-Protein Smoothies for Weight Loss**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/7-best-high-protein-smoothies-weight-loss/). The explanations of *why* each smoothie works (protein sources, balance, and when to use them) helped me stay consistent without overthinking.

Do these smoothies magically melt fat? No. But using the **7 Best High-Protein Smoothies for Weight Loss** made it easier to stay satisfied, control portions naturally, and keep energy stable—which is what actually supported progress for me.

Now I keep 2–3 high-protein smoothies in rotation and adjust based on my day (more calories on workout days, lighter on rest days). It’s simple, repeatable, and doesn’t feel like a diet.

Curious—have high-protein smoothies helped you stay full, or do you still prefer solid meals for weight loss?

Some time ago I made[ this coffee commercial video](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1j9je6k/i_did_this_coffee_commercial_project_in_blender/) in blender and decided to do an updated version based on the community's feedback. This time I used high poly beans, better texture maps for the grinded coffee displacement and remade the fluid animation with less turbulence (although not 100% satisfied with it). I also made a more accurate shader for the coffee (more golden/brown, less white cream) and fixed the typo issues (no more eXpresso!)

The project itself is rendered on cycles, and the simulation is generated with blender's native mantaflow. Post-production was done in after effects. I did the drawings (coffee bean, grinder and coffee cup) with a tablet.

I wanted to thank you all for the wonderful comments and constructive criticism, you've helped me a lot!

I am starting to run to the end of the 5lb sample packs of green beans that came with the machine. I looked through some older posts and it looks like the company I bought the machine from, [Pre-Umber](https://www.pre-umber.ca/collections/green-coffee-beans), is pretty reasonable for buying smaller batches of green beans. [Green Coffee Co](https://greencoffeeco.com/) looks like another decent alternative (Canadian).

I have been aiming for medium(lightish) roasts and so far have found the Peruvian and Brazilian beans the best. My recent Ethiopian roast wasn't quite as enjoyable, but that may have been from a lack of education on my part.

I welcome any insight/recommendations.

But after a stretch of feeling bloated, dehydrated, and stuck in snack mode, I decided to test the idea behind **DETOX Water Burn Belly Fat in 14 days: The Science-Backed 14-Day Blueprint**—not as a miracle cure, but as a habit experiment.

I didn’t diet aggressively. I didn’t cut carbs. I didn’t start training harder. I just followed a simple hydration routine and paid attention to how my body responded. The first thing I noticed wasn’t fat loss—it was *consistency*. Drinking water became automatic instead of something I forgot until late afternoon.

By the end of week one, bloating was noticeably lower, especially in the evenings. That’s when **DETOX Water Burn Belly Fat in 14 days: The Science-Backed 14-Day Blueprint** started to make sense to me. It’s less about “burning fat” directly and more about reducing water retention, improving digestion, and curbing mindless snacking.

What actually helped:

* Drinking earlier in the day (before coffee/snacks)
* Keeping flavors light (citrus, herbs—not juice)
* Sipping throughout the day instead of chugging
* Replacing soda/extra coffee with infused water

By days 10–14, a few things stood out:

* My stomach felt flatter in the mornings
* I craved fewer salty/sugary snacks
* Energy felt steadier
* Skin looked less dull (probably hydration)

I also learned what *didn’t* work. Adding too much fruit turned it into sugar water and made me hungrier later. Once I kept things simple, the **DETOX Water Burn Belly Fat in 14 days: The Science-Backed 14-Day Blueprint** felt supportive instead of gimmicky.

I followed this guide for structure and timing: [**DETOX Water Burn Belly Fat in 14 days: The Science-Backed 14-Day Blueprint**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/detox-water-burn-belly-fat-14-days/). The “blueprint” part helped—knowing *when* to drink what removed guesswork and kept me consistent.

Do I think detox water alone melts belly fat? No. But used consistently, **DETOX Water Burn Belly Fat in 14 days: The Science-Backed 14-Day Blueprint** made it easier to hydrate well, eat lighter without trying, and reduce bloating—which actually changed how my midsection looked and felt.

I’m keeping this habit, especially after heavy meals or weekends when digestion feels off.

Curious—have you noticed real changes from infused/detox water, or does plain water work just as well for you?

I’d wake up bloated, grab coffee on an empty stomach, skip breakfast, and then wonder why my energy crashed by mid-morning. I kept hearing about “fat-burning morning drinks,” but honestly, most of them sounded like hype.

Still, I decided to experiment with the idea behind **7 Fat Burning Morning Drinks for a Flat Belly and Weight Loss**, not expecting miracles—just hoping for less bloating and better energy.

I didn’t change my entire diet. I just added one intentional drink first thing in the morning and waited 20–30 minutes before coffee or food. That small shift alone made a noticeable difference. The key thing I learned is that these drinks aren’t about burning fat instantly—they’re about *starting digestion and hydration properly*.

After about a week of rotating options from the **7 Fat Burning Morning Drinks for a Flat Belly and Weight Loss**, here’s what I noticed:

* Morning bloating was noticeably reduced
* I felt lighter instead of sluggish
* I didn’t crave sugar as much early in the day
* Coffee stopped feeling like a necessity

What worked best were drinks that focused on hydration and digestion rather than sweetness. When I leaned too much into fruit-heavy options, hunger came back fast. Once I stuck to simpler combinations, the **7 Fat Burning Morning Drinks for a Flat Belly and Weight Loss** approach made more sense.

A few things that actually mattered:

* Drinking the morning drink *before* coffee
* Sipping slowly instead of chugging
* Giving my body time to wake up digestion
* Keeping the rest of my morning routine normal

I followed this guide for structure and ideas: [**7 Fat Burning Morning Drinks for a Flat Belly and Weight Loss**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/fat-burning-morning-drinks/). What helped most was understanding *why* certain drinks work better in the morning instead of randomly trying things.

Do I think these drinks magically flatten your belly overnight? No. But using the **7 Fat Burning Morning Drinks for a Flat Belly and Weight Loss** consistently made mornings calmer, reduced bloating, and helped me make better food choices later in the day. That ripple effect was way more valuable than I expected.

Now I keep 2–3 morning drinks in rotation and use them especially after heavy dinners or weekends when my digestion feels off. It’s one of the easiest habits I’ve stuck with.

Curious what others think—do you start your day with coffee right away, or have you tried hydration or digestion-focused morning drinks first?

We never had sex nor held hands. Nothing. He didn’t show interest in it either 

He wanted to go abroad during July - October which I rejected.
He said we can go abroad to ""officialise""
I didn't want to go tbh and I knew I'd have to have sex if i did 

We had a date in October 2025 which I paid for as it was my turn. Afterwards I wanted to have a coffee with him. 
I pointed out a few places outside and he didn’t want to take me there as they were expensive so he ended up buying me coffee from the Tesco Costa machines 😂 

It really didn’t make sense because when he started dating me the dates were expensive, the first 3 dates were about £60-£70 

Between October 2024-January 2025, we hadn’t messaged for about three months but he randomly popped up again on my messages end of January 2025. 

We started dating again in March 2025 till June when he completely stopped talking to me. 

I faced a sexual assault in June 2025 (last year). He’s response was victim blaming. He goes up I was groped because of what I was wearing. He said
“He chose a sexy girl with a nice chest”
After he said that, I stopped talking to him. But I reached back out to him again after I got somewhat justice and waiting for the trial as the suspect also assaulted more than 10 other women. 

I messaged him numerous times if he wants to eat out he keeps making excuses he’s not free. 

In total we had upto 20 dates. He paid for about 12 of the dates, I paid for about 8 of them. 

Tbh he never even told me he wanted to officialise. I guess now we are completely over. 

He doesn’t even wanna go out as friends or do split payment 
I did wanna remain friends 

Has he just given up? 

Edit: yeah I agree I should’ve not reached out again after being victim blamed

But he’s a total flop. He dated a woman over 20 times just to be rejected in the end. ",0,1767624885.0,Bumble,19,0.31,False

How can I maximize my weight lost for this year, goal for next year is 250, but I am not sure how realistic this is. I am finally at college and have a lot more independence. Things I need help with is what to eat, how many calories, what not to eat, and what activities can I do to not only loose weight but build muscle. One thing to note, I am not open to going to a gym. I am open to buying weights, and anything necessary, it's easier to put it like there is no gym near me. 





**Food:** 



I have access to a dining account provided by my school, there are many different things I could eat, pasta, sandwiches, pizza, hamburgers, you know the usual, but there is also more options within your typical plate, vegetables, and some sort of meat. also what should i eat for breakfast? we have eggs, sausage, bacon, quesadilla, French toast? I can also cook simple things if I want to do it my way. my usual plate for breakfast at home were 3 chorizo and potato, bean burritos. but we are not doing that again. can i drink coffee? I like coffee? but I don't want to do sugar? what happens if I just completely take sugar out of my diet? as far as my blood test go, I am approaching a stage of pre-diabetes, and I have noticed some skin tags and darker areas in my neck. so basically for this section, what should i eat? what should I completely not touch, for example, tortillas are out, I used to eat 8-10 per meal.



**Exercise:** 



I did play sports in high school, but I just don't find myself doing that again in college as a physics + math major. I don't have any movement restrictions, but i do get tired very easily as expected. what can I do at home to loose weight, exercises? should I buy weights? what kind of things should i do. I will take more walks, but being my size, I care to much about what people think of me, so going on runs is a bit embarrassing, I just don't want to be seen, but that is a problem that only I can solve, it's going to take some time on my end.

I just discovered Valhrona Abinao 85%. It was an explosion of cocoa savour in my mouth. I loved it. The Canadian online shops are all out of stock. I found Callebaut Power 80% in stock and I'm wondering if people have tried both and how they compare. I know tastes are subjective. It's for daily personal consumption as chocolate bar (I'm not a fan of ganache).

I tried Valrhona Tulakalum 75% and found it way too fruity. I don't like it.

Lindt 85% was my favorite chocolate until yesterday, now I find it tasteless and ""buttery"". 

  
80%+ Chocolate is my main ""source of sweetness"" so decided to experiment with different flavours. It's fun, so far the best are

\- matcha (I want to do matcha/lemon today)

\- lemon rosemary (it's one of the best one, I want to try thyme too)

\- coffee nibs (decaf)

\- chai tea (really good too, I might add some citrus next)

\- quinoa puffed (mine were not crunchy enough, to try again)

\- raspberries

Next will be blood orange, lemon (both are in my dehydrator), jasmine tea/lemon, ginger (with citrus I think) and maybe gochugaru (Korean red pepper).

  
I would like to try orange blossom but I only have orange blossom water. I'm wondering if a tiny bit will really impact the chocolate if I eat it in the next few days. I might just try it. Any advice?

My boss had no experience owning a business or in being a barista before this cafe and I had to help out a it with drink recipes and getting things organized. A few months ago I had a sort of breakdown because my boss puts weird responsibilities or other things on me because of her own stress. For example, I  had a few doctors appointments because I  have epilepsy. In a meeting she told me that if I  don’t work more ( I couldnt work because of my appointments…) they would go bankrupt and they’ve put everything they have into the cafe. Or telling me things like her mother, who works at the shop, is almost 70 and she can’t do everything! implying that I make her mom do everything for me (her mom works in the kitchen and I work in the front as a barista… I often help in the back when I can). Idk my boss just says a lot of things that are putting her own stress onto me and makes me stressed. she also told me 3 months ago I could probably get a raise but I havent because shes stressed about not making enough at the cafe

Nothing fancy, we bring cuttings, pots we dont need, maybe a little soil, and we just trade and chat for an hour. It’s honestly been such a sweet low pressure hobby thing for me. One friend I met there, “Lena”, is super outgoing and became kinda the unofficial hype person. The problem is she is also the person who shows up with plants that are clearly not doing well, like sticky leaves, tiny webs, weird spots, and she’ll laugh it off like “lol my apartment is a jungle.” A few months ago I traded for a pothos from her, quarantined it for a week, thought it was fine, then a bunch of my plants got mealybugs. I spent weeks wiping leaves, isolating stuff, tossing two plants I’d had for years, it sucked. I didn’t accuse her because I couldnt prove it, but I did gently say in the group chat that we should all check for pests and maybe keep swaps to cuttings only if we’re unsure. She replied with a joking meme and everyone moved on.



Last month she showed up with a whole tray, and I could literally see little white cottony bits on one stem. I pulled her aside and said hey, I’m not trying to be mean, but can you please not trade anything that might have pests. She got defensive fast and said I’m “plant policing” her and making her feel gross, and that pests happen to everyone. I agreed, but also told her I’m still dealing with the fallout from the last time and I can’t risk it again. After the swap she DM’d me saying I embarrassed her and that I’m acting like she’s contagious. I replied that I’m sorry it felt that way, but if she wants to come next time I need her to only bring clean cuttings in water, or just come to hang out with nothing to trade. She said no, that’s insulting, and she’s not coming if she’s being treated like a problem. Now a couple people in the group are saying I should just drop it because “it’s just plants,” but for me it’s money, time, and honestly it was my calming thing and now it’s stressful. Am I being unfair here?

1q4nfqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuroSociology/comments/1q4nfqq/my_hypomania_recipe_for_an_adhd_w_socalled_bipolar/,"My ""Hypomania recipe"" for an ADHD /w so-called ""bipolar"".","I've been trying to work this one out for a while now...""chasing the dragon"", so to speak, since getting in a prolonged hypomanic state a few months back; lasted \~2 months, and I was ""on top of the world"".

**Here's the short version:**

Summon a major injustice (or whatever it is that you bottled up years ago that still haunts you) and get fixated on it; amplify it with caffeine and videos, music or other media that forces it to the forefront of your mind. Throw in some substances (weed, booze, meds) to lower your control, while fixated on it.

Then, with it ramped up, seek *validation* (or vindication) for those feelings...another, trusted person...or, failing that, find someone talking about a similar experience of theirs on Youtube or wherever. 

(Unless you can do it all on your own, which most of us can't...because we don't trust ourselves...because of something someone did to us.)

**The TL/DR version:**

*Feel* the real *depths* of the damned thing and get it ***validated***. 

**Expanded:**

Going back to my long-lasting hypomanic phase...after years mostly stuck in the depressive state...

It was all sparked by figuring out the issue I've been trying to figure out since I was a little kid - how social interactions *actually* work - and when I did, I felt a huge weight lifted and mental resources were suddenly freed up...there was a long-lasting cascade of other issues that got figured out in the wake of it, which only added to the length/depth of it.

It was ***very*** validating.

I can't stress that enough. ***Very.***

And it was that validation - on something that had been an issue for decades - that was the root/reason for my hypomania.

Is that what bipolar swings are all about? I'd already roughly figured that out...but this is confirming evidence...and ties in directly with previous conclusions...summed up as this:

Mania & depression...in bipolar, possibly elsewhere...is driven by **validation** and ***in*****validation**, respectively.

Is in me, anyway...and if there's one thing I've learned recently, it's that if it's happening in me, it's happening in thousands or even millions of other people.

There's your seed of internal validation, people...*whatever you think you're going through, there are millions of other people going through the same thing right now.* 

Which means you're not alone with it.

And that's exactly the problem...we think we're alone with it; we *blame ourselves*. We bottle it up out of shame. 

Re-read that...you really want to give that seed a chance to take root. **You're not alone with it.**

...of course, your brain/ego is going to call BS on me for that statement. Like mine did - and still does - to try and dissuade me from opening my eyes to any other possibility.

That's the trap; an *ego* trap. Hear it? Hear it telling you not to pay attention to my attempt at planting that seed in your head? 

I hear mine...and *I'm the freaking guy who wrote it*.

Piss off, ego (you were supposed to stop bothering me two plus decades ago).

Wait, what were we actually talking about? Umm...""mania & depression in bipolar being caused by validation and invalidation"", that was it...

Think about it...they can't figure out the real cause of it...because the person experiencing it is entirely too absorbed by the thoughts that get them there...they don't correlate their enhanced (either way) mood to the thoughts they were stuck on...because they're only half aware that they're even processing it over and over again in the background...most thought is subconscious...so they're only peripherally aware of it.

Meanwhile the brain is ""stuck on loop"" with it's processing of this one question/issue and is over-heating...it's still affecting your emotions, trying to force the brain to come up with an answer...which it can't, hence the loop...so it's slowly building you in to a fight or flight mode...and that's what the states of bipolar represent...fight or flight. Or in this case fight or freeze; manic go-getter or depressed and unable to get out of bed.

...

...

...

Even if you don't believe my reasoning - or lack there of - the first thing you should take away from this is the notion that your brain is doing a lot of stuff in the background that you are unaware of.

The rest builds upon that...so if you don't believe me, go watch/read a plethora of stuff on consciousness/awareness that's out there; we'll wait.

So...you're stuck on something, something traumatic probably...that you bottled up...but your brain will *not* ""let it go"" until it has come to a resolution. So it keeps replaying it on loop in the background, so as to work up your emotions to a level that is sufficient enough to *force* you in to doing something about it...in other words, *making a decision* on something you aren't satisfied with the results of.

We're back to cognitive distortion again.

Which is what's at the core of all stress and therefore all mental health problems.

All because you/I/we can't make a decision that we're satisfied with.

""Oh, but I decided it was my fault years ago; it's no longer a question.""

Yeah...yeah...you did, didn't you? You chose the easiest target...the one that won't attack you back for blaming it...*yourself.*

Ok, maybe you're *not* me. But that's what I did. I'm willing to bet there's millions of you out there that did that exact same thing...

**You bottled it up by blaming yourself for it.**

Is that how bottling up works? Probably...have to satisfy the brain somehow, resolve the ""cognitive distortion""...so you go with the easiest scapegoat.

Ha.

Ha...

I'd laugh...I'd laugh my ass off...if I had any booze in my system...as a means of resolving the mess of feelings that comes along with realizing what years of ""bottling it up"" put me through.

Laughing, I guess, is a form of self-validation. Interesting. I'll explore that another time.

So...try and stay focused, jackass...

So. That would mean that mania occurs when we resolve a ""cognitive distortion"" that we've left on the back-burner for years...the depth and length of said state of elevated mood will be proportional to the depth and length of the negative emotional load that's built up in that time.

...and the flip side? The crash, the resulting depression...will occur when your new ""solution"" is proven false and you now have to face the fact that you were ""so close"", you ""thought you had it""...

It was nice while it lasted?

But that's the point...this yo-yo effect between emotional states is there for a reason...reward/punishment system...manic/depressive...it all boils down to your brain trying to resolve something.

Because that's all the brain does...it's a survival tool...compare the present to the past to predict the future.. 

It's life or death; you *have to* resolve those things it gets stuck on. Those...traumas.

Well, shit. I need a drink now, but there isn't any in the house.

Sigh.

Booze, for me, is one of my self-rewards. I'm a happy drunk. Well, not if I'm in a depressive state...then it ain't positive. 

Explains why I just ""treated myself"" to a better K-cup of coffee than is my norm.

...because it's part of how I hijack/encourage my reward system. 

Honestly, people...figure out what works for you...I think there's some cheesecake in the fridge that might make this as good of a reward as a few drinks...nope, it's a bailey's mousse cake or something. Eh, still helps.

...that's a good segue...to the actual point of all of this...I'm hell-bent on figuring out how my brain operates, so that I can manipulate it...in to actually letting me enjoy what's left of my life. 

**I'm going to teach my POS brain who's boss; I'm going to make it** ***beg*****.**

That's why I am on here, on Reddit...burning through accounts...for validation in my ""journey"".

We've reached the ""journaling"" stage, it seems.

...yeah, there's nothing altruistic about my rambling; it's ultimately for my own benefit. *My* validation.

# The Milky Way is a Lie!

https://i.redd.it/e8fquxp0kjbg1.gif

Literally.  The in-game version of the “Milky Way” is completely made up.  Sorry to disappoint those who rushed to their telescopes to look for the Muppet Face.

It’s not even aligned the way it is in our own night sky.  In the real world, our solar system is about 60 degrees off the galactic plane.  In Starfield, however, we and possibly every other system are directly on it.  Moreover, the skybox as a whole is aligned so that the Milky Way stretches across the Celestial Equator, which in the real world is our own equator projected into space.  (It’s a bit more complicated than that, but we’ll save that for now.)

Why isn’t the Milky Way more accurately represented?  Partly for practical reasons, perhaps, but also for artistic reasons, as the alignment of the galactic plane with orbits and familiar constellations gives the observer a stronger and more consistent focal line to the night sky.  It’s no accident that Muppet Face is right next to Orion.  And no accident that it’s the thing I first latched onto.

# The Truth is in the Stars!

The stars, however, are all—as far as I can tell—real.  In most cases, they display real-world Catalogue IDs taken from the *Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars*.  Thanks to those Catalogue IDs, most stars can be identified in the night sky.

Some of the stars have real-world names, and for the most part Bethesda has kept those.  Most names, however, are invented, with a diverse set of influences.

Let’s take a tour, and I’ll point out the highlights.

# A little about the methodology

These pictures were taken from the same position at the **NASA Launch Tower** over the course of one night as the stars passed overhead, although I did reload the save to capture better shots where needed. 

In the game Earth has a thin CO2 atmosphere, and stars are visible through what on present-day Earth would be about a 7.5 Apparent Magnitude, so we can see a fair bit better than in the real world, where the limit is about 6.5.  If you’re lucky.  (Higher magnitudes means dimmer stars because the scale has its origin in class rankings, with “Class 1” being brighter than “Class 2” and so on.)

The constellations are drawn out per the Wikipedia entries for each constellation, but even those maps sometimes contradict each other when it comes to connecting the dots, so that goes to show the variability in how the constellations can be rendered.

Wikipedia was also useful in locating many specific stars, but it could only do so much.  For the more obscure, I cross-referenced various Web sites for further catalogue references and maps.  The following were particularly helpful:

[http://migall.fastmail.fm.user.fm/astronomy/stars\_and\_nebulae/CNS3/CNS3\_distance.htm](http://migall.fastmail.fm.user.fm/astronomy/stars_and_nebulae/CNS3/CNS3_distance.htm)

[Stellarcatalog.com](http://stellarcatalog.com/)

[News.sky-map.org](http://news.sky-map.org/)

But now let’s get on with the show.

# It’s time to play the music

Here’s the Muppet Face and its immediate neighbors, most notably **Orion**, the Hunter.

https://i.redd.it/f9zqjxp0kjbg1.gif

To Orion’s left are his two loyal companions, **Canis Major** and **Canis Minor**.  Canis Major looks like a dachshund to me, not sure how that qualifies as a “Bigger Dog,” but it sure is compared to Canis Minor, which is *just a line*.

In cyan I mark in-game stars.  **Sirius** and **Procyon** are two of the brightest stars in our real-world night sky.  Sirius was of great importance in ancient Egypt, as it would rise just before dawn around the time of the Nile’s annual flooding. The Greeks also noted this time since it coincided with the hottest time of the year, and the colloquial “Dog Star” gave rise to the “dog days of summer.”  Procyon was noteworthy as the herald of Sirius, as it was nearby, similarly bright, and rose just beforehand.  Its own name literally means “Before the Dog” (*pro-kuon*).

**Luyten’s Star** isn’t visible to the naked eye, but I’ve marked its location anyway since it too has a real name (after one if its discoverers).  Bethesda may have short-changed it by giving it just one planet.  It actually has at least two—possibly four—and one of them is in the sweet spot for life.  In another twenty years we should find out if any hypothetical Luytenians like the Europop astronomers transmitted to them a few years ago.

To Orion’s right is **Eridanus**, which represents a long and winding river.  So long that the star **Eridani** isn’t in the frame.  In fact, I think it’s just too far south to see from here.

And then we have **Lepus,** the “Rabbit.”  Often represented as being hunted by Orion and the dogs.  Here I’ll take the opportunity to note that I’ve connected the dots for every constellation I could identify, but I won’t necessarily have anything to say about them, especially when they don’t feature in-game star systems.

From here we’ll generally be heading backwards along the Milky Way.

# Release the Kraken

https://i.redd.it/hfpikxp0kjbg1.gif

Just one in-game star visible here, **Tau Ceti**.  That’s the real-world name for the star, with the “Ceti” indicating it’s in the constellation **Cetus**.  Cetus is the mythological sea monster slain by Perseus.  “Release the Cetus” didn’t test well for the movie, I guess.

We have a little more of Eridanus in this shot, but nope—still no Eridani.

Although not visible to the naked eye from Earth, I’ve noted the location of **Van Maanen’s Star**, named for its discoverer by Luyten before he got one of his own.

You’ll note how we can see three signs of the Zodiac—**Aries**, **Pisces**, and **Aquarius**—here.  The full set of 12 spans the circuit of the sky, arching above and then below the Celestial Equator in line with the year’s sunrises.  The sunrise crosses the Celestial Equator on the Equinoxes, so here when it’s in—um, *Pisces*?

# A precession digression

For those who don’t know, the Earth spins like a top, but it also *wobble*s like a top.  That wobble is called “precession,” and it causes the Earth to rotate the N-S axis itself over the course of around **26 thousand years**.  That leads to interesting tidbits like **Polaris** no longer being the North Star in another couple thousand years.  And, of course, that the Sun has *already* been rising in Pisces on the Spring Equinox for the *last* couple thousand years.  (I’m not an Aries?!?)  In fact, we’re almost *done* with Pisces being the first sign.  Don’t worry, the astrologers know all about that, and they eagerly await the “Age of Aquarius.”

Let’s proceed a bit further.

# The Edge of the Known World

https://i.redd.it/5y0asxp0kjbg1.gif

The only in-game stars in this shot are up in **Cassiopeia**, and you might well be wondering, after the third pic, *just where all the star systems are*.  And there’s a good answer!

Check your in-game map of the Settled Systems.  Recall that we start out on the lefthand side of that map, and most of the stars are to the right.  Well, guess which side of that map we’ve been looking at.  So far, anyway.  But hold tight, the deluge will be coming.

# Say my name

As for names, **Eta Cassiopeia** is close but not quite right.  The star in question is **Eta Cassiopiae A**, and this is a good opportunity to explain what all the elements of that name mean.  Star names often start with a Greek letter and a variant of a constellation name.  This is called a **Bayer Designation**.  The Greek letters are assigned roughly in order of brightness, and the constellation is rendered in a genitive form (possessive), so “Eta Cassiopeiae” means the 5^(th) brightest star in Cassiopeia.  In this case there’s an extra “A” because it turned out there were multiple stars in the system, something Bayer himself wouldn’t have known 400 years ago.

You might also see similar names with Arabic numerals, so **24 Cassiopiae** in this star’s case.  That’s a **Flamsteed Designation**, and the number is in order of increasing right ascension, but precession has messed up some of that order, and I’m getting a headache, so… I’m going with Bayer. 

This star actually has a formal name of **Achird**, but Bethesda didn’t use that.  It’s a curious name, initially appearing in an astronomy atlas in 1950, but otherwise nobody knows where it came from.  (That atlas ultimately slipped in a *dozen* star names of otherwise unknown origin.)

Fictional names can be anything, although some might mimic the form used in star designations.  **Carinae** would seem to be in reference to the constellation **Carina**, but here it’s in *Cassiopeia*.  **Alpha** and **Beta Andraste** don’t reference any constellation but rather a Brittonic war goddess.  And the “Alpha” and “Beta” prefixes would be quite unusual for companion stars in the same system since those prefixes pre-date our awareness of multiple-star systems.

# The deluge begins

https://i.redd.it/1ncxmzp0kjbg1.gif

*Lots* of in-game stars here.  **Xi Ophiuchi** and **Guniibuu** are real-world names.

**Serpentis** is close.  *All* the stars in **Serpens** have “Serpentis” in their names, but this one is the “Alpha.”  It also has its own unique name, **Unukalhai**, based on its traditional Arabic name.

**Kavnyk** isn’t a real star name, nor is it named after a known historical or mythological figure.  As best as I can tell, it’s derived from a Yiddish and/or Slavic word for “coffee pot.”  The real-world star (NN 3921) is designated as **Epsilon Serpentis**.

**Zeta Ophiuchi** is a real-world *name*, but that’s a different star 440 light years away (Gl 673).  The one in-game (Gl 670B) is a companion to Xi Ophiuchi.

**Foucault** has been referred to as **Zubenelgenubi**, although that name now officially belongs to a companion star not found in the game.  “Foucault” itself comes from the French physicist famous for his pendulum, which demonstrates the Earth’s rotation by swinging endlessly back-and-forth but *appearing* to trace out a circle over the course of the day.  There used to be one in front of the Star-Spangled Banner at the Smithsonian, but I was distraught to find out it was removed over 25 years ago!

**Alpha**, **Beta**, and **Proxima Ternion** sound like real star names, but these are invented.  The actual trio (Wo 9540 A/B/C) are designated as **Xi Scorpii A**, **B**, and **C**.  And, since it’s come up in the comments already, I’ll note that the major stars defining Orion would indeed look *more-or-less the same* from Beta Ternion because those stars are *much* further away.  But there’s more to the story than that, which I’ll save for later.

**Delta** and **Gamma Vulpes** sound like they might have been intended for the constellation **Vulpecula** at some point, although the proper genitive form would be “Vulpeculae.”

Also noting that some major plot-relevant systems are in this frame:  **Guniibuu**, **Indum**, **Masada**, as well as the Crimson Fleet’s home system **Kryx** and, as already mentioned, the **Kavnyk** system from Shattered Space.

One other note.  How is **Sagittarius** *not* a teapot?

Let’s proceed a bit further.

# Getting Messier in the Virgo Cluster

https://i.redd.it/lb5vo2q0kjbg1.gif

Plenty of in-game stars in this shot as well.  Four of them have real-world names:  **Syrma**, **Porrima**, **Algorab**, and **Alchiba**.  It’s worth noting that three of these names are from Arabic.  In fact, out of more than 500 internationally recognized star names, more than a *third* of them come from Arabic, a testament to the legacy of medieval Arab astronomy.

In fact, **Heinlein** and **Lantana** have official names from Arabic as well (**Zaniah** for the former, **Zavijava** for the latter).  Bethesda presumably didn’t use them because the applications were relatively recent.

Notable in-game systems pictured here include **Volii**, where Neon is located.  And **Porrima**, of course, is home to both Paradiso and the Red Mile.

Let’s take a look upward from here.  You can connect the dots from Virgo.

# Mane Sequence

https://i.redd.it/1zkypyp0kjbg1.gif

Here we have a few more in-game star systems.  **Denebola** and **Zosma** are both real-world star names.  **Charybdis** is invented, named for the mythical sea creature.  Personally, I would’ve made it part of a binary with “Scylla.”  (The real-world star, **88 Leonis A**, *is* part of a binary, so it could be an idea that was dropped along the way.)

**Ursae Majoris** has a real-world name of **Alulua Australis**, which Bethesda didn’t use.  Its companion is called **Ursae Minoris**, which implies it’s in a whole different constellation (Ursa Minor, or the Little Dipper).  Both stars are designated **Xi Ursae Majoris** in the real world (A and B to distinguish them).

Although not visible to the naked eye from Earth, I’ve noted the location of **Wolf**, which is known in the real world as **Wolf 359**.  Astronomer Max Wolf catalogued over 1000 dim stars, and this one also turned out to be one of the closest.  This catalogue entry has since solidified into an unofficial name in his honor.  

A bit of sci-fi trivia.  In the world of Star Trek, the Borg wiped out a Federation fleet in this system.

**Ixyll** can be found as part of the **Coma Berenices**.  The area of this constellation is defined by squared-off edges, but the body is the undefined flush of stars in the upper-right corner, which are identified with the hair of Berenice II, a queen of Hellenistic Egypt who sacrificed her locks as a votive offering so the king might return safely from war in Syria.  (He wound up abandoning the Syrian campaign early to take care of an internal rebellion.  Success?)

Another bit of sci-fi trivia.  In Larry Niven’s “Known Space” universe, the third planet orbiting **Kumasi** (Gliese 434, or 61 Ursae Majoris) is the homeworld of the warlike Kzinti.  The name Kumasi itself derives from the old capital of the real-world Asante Empire.

Now let’s turn our head a bit to the left, and shake-shake-shake.

# Shake that Boötes

\*Ahem\* The diacritic means both o’s are pronounced separately.  

https://i.redd.it/y0um8yp0kjbg1.gif

**Boötes** is the plowman and is often depicted as driving **Ursa Major** and **Minor** when interpreted as oxen with plows.

**Arcturus** is one of the brightest stars in the real-world night sky and the destination of the early sci-fi novel *A Voyage to Arcturus*.  **Muphrid** is also a real-world star name.

There’s a real-world star called **Rana** as well, but it’s **Delta Eridani** (GJ 150), whereas the one *in-game* (NN 3841) is **18 Boötis**.  So, did Bethesda screw up?  Well, the “real” Rana is *itself* the result of a screw-up.  Giuseppi Piazzi, who named it *Rana Secunda*, apparently confused it with **Beta Ceti**, because that’s the *original* “Second Frog” according to earlier Arab astronomers.

Piazzi… Piazzi… Why does that sound familiar…?

I’d be remiss if I didn’t also point out **Cheyenne**, the home system of the Freestar Collective.  The real-world star is designated as **Xi Boötis A**.  (Maheo is “B.”)

And **Luna** showed up for a photo bomb.

Now let’s tilt back down a bit.

# Oh, yeah, that Piazzi

https://i.redd.it/eeo14yp0kjbg1.gif

As for the **Piazzi/Bessel** system.  Giuseppi Piazzi and Friedrich Bessel both studied the movement of the **61 Cygni** system to flag it as nearby, and it’s been informally linked to them even before anyone knew there were two stars, though the names “Piazzi’s Flying Star” and “Bessel’s Star” are *unofficial*.  Good on Bethesda for noticing the connection and applying it to their own naming scheme.

**Vega** is one of the brightest and most-studied stars in our real-world night sky.  It’s also home to the advanced civilization in Carl Sagan’s *Contact*.  And about 12 thousand years ago, it was the North Star! 

**Altair** is another one of the brightest stars in the real-world night sky.  And the planet Altair IV is the titular “forbidden planet” in the classic 50s sci-fi film.

**Rasalhague** is also a real-world name, in Arabic a reference to the head of the snake handler (*i.e*., Ophiuchus handling Serpens).

Although not visible to the naked eye from Earth, I’ve noted the location of **Barnard’s Star**, named in the real world after its discoverer.  This star is the fastest-known star.  It’s currently just under 6 light years away, but after another 10 thousand years it’ll come within 4, closer than the nearest star is now.  Although in the game it has just one planet, it’s recently come to light that it has at least four.

It’s also worth noting the presence of the **Narion** system, where we start the game.

Now let’s head back past Leo to where we started the tour.

# Chasing its tail

https://i.redd.it/anhof1q0kjbg1.gif

And here we wrap back around to where we started, with **Procyon** there to meet us like the loyal dog it is.

Wait, were we able to make a full nighttime circuit?  Hmm… we’ll revisit that notion in due time.

# What I didn’t find

All in all, I’ve marked **96** of the **121** star systems in the game.  That leaves **25**.  

**8** were simply too dim to see from Earth (apparent magnitudes of 8 or higher).  I could’ve noted their locations, but I didn’t want to circle blank spaces, so I only did that for a few noteworthy examples with real-world names.

**10** have no catalogue IDs in game and have invented names, so I couldn’t match them to real-world stars.  It should be noted that **Kang** is the *name* of a real star, but that one’s well outside the Settled Systems (255 light years away).  And its spectral class, mass, temperature, and magnitude don’t match those of the in-game star, so I just consider the name a coincidence.

**6** were too far south to see from Cape Canaveral.  That includes **Alpha Centauri**.

And then there’s **Sol**.  I looked *all night*, but I just couldn’t find it…

# Looking Up

I can’t properly end this tour without showing off the Big Kahunas of the northern skies.  Here are **Ursa Major**, the “Bigger Bear”—better known these days for its tail section, the “Big Dipper—and **Ursa Minor**, the “Smaller Bear”—otherwise known as the “Little Dipper.” 

https://i.redd.it/mlvlk1q0kjbg1.gif

These two constellations have influenced each other in both directions.  The former originated as a bear but came to be associated with the plow or dipper by its association with the latter (and further connecting both to **Boötes**, the plowman, which here sits just below the horizon).  Whereas the latter started out as a wagon and came to be seen as a bear for the same reason.

The word *arctic* references the direction of “the bear” (*arktos* in Greek).  *Antarctic* is, by extension, “opposite the bear.”  And the star **Arcturus**, in Boötes, is literally the “Guardian of the Bear.”

I’ve marked **Polaris**, which, while not an in-game system, is still noteworthy in the game as it is in the real world—at least, for now.  I mentioned earlier that it won’t remain the North Star forever thanks to precession.  In fact, it wasn’t even the North Star during the height of Greek astronomy.  It is today, of course, and it’s currently within 1 degree of True North but, in the next century it’ll start inching away until, *eventually*, another star is closer, and then another, and then another...

But for now, let’s kick back and enjoy the dance of stars around Polaris.

https://i.redd.it/ejntgkpvljbg1.gif

Wait, that’s on *Jemison*.  Which may—or may not—explain a few odd things.  To start with, *are those constellations backwards?!?*

Matched with a 29 F Ukranian lady on dating app, she initiated the first date and suggested we go bowling, I met her there for the first time played some darts, 2 drinks and bowling after was a casual very first date, I didn't feel she was looking for anything at that point, just got to know each other and some small talk, After this I did not initiate any convo with her for about 2 weeks.

Then she wished me for christmas, and I wished back. My friend said to ask for another date, I thought fine what could go wrong atleast it's practice.

2nd Date:

\- Took her out to a traditional celtic music show and dinner. No room for much convo there as it was fairly noisy. But we had a great time.  I could sense that she was much more open then last time.

\- After the show went out for 2 more drinks, she was tired as she was straight out of work and had a early work day the next. Walked her to the bus stop and realized her phone was almost dead. So I called in and paid for a cab, and also bought a small perfume for her like a christmas present. I never saw that big of a glow and excitement till then and gave me a big goodbye hug. She said she had a great time and thanked me for the present again.

1 more week of nothing goes by, I decided to wish her for new years, and in the process asked her if she's upto another small coffee brunch and walk in the park, she sugested we go to the zoo and she sent of video on tik tok of the place, I was like fine.

Till that point never cared to look her socials up, and then I got wind of her tik tok profile, where she puts videos of her work (Hair dressing/extension) and the other part lifestyle type videos, and they're mostly about money expensive things and how she excpects her man to look after her and buy expensive gifts. (They're mostly in russian) so i don't really get if she's being sarcastic or serious,  using google translate can be a hit or a miss.

She also says that she wants to find love and is actively dating, she put a video about our last date on her tik tok and how surprised she was, how much of a gentle man and a green flag I was.

At this stage Im honestly confused, if she's looking for sugar daddy's to take her out (she's been going out with multiple guys in between and most of them were duds is what she says )

Need advice on is it worth pursuing this lady? is slowly warming up to me? or am I getting trolled here. Now that I know what she's upto I'd like to meet here one last time and make up my mind if this is worth it.",1,1767624072.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Loud environments, big groups, and constant socializing wear me out quickly, so I spend most of my time in quieter settings: curled up with a book, watching shows or films alone, listening to music on walks, studying in empty corners of the library, or just enjoying the peace of my own space. I am posting here because I would like to find someone who truly understands that and is looking for the same kind of gentle, low-key relationship.

I do not enjoy parties, bars, crowded events, or anything high-energy. What I love instead is one-on-one time that feels easy and natural: sitting together in comfortable silence, sharing a quiet coffee or tea in a nearly empty cafe, cooking something simple at home and talking while we eat, going for slow walks where conversation flows or fades without pressure, or staying in to watch something and share thoughts afterward. I value depth over small talk, honesty, patience, and plenty of personal space to recharge.

A little more about me: I study art history, spend hours reading (mostly novels, poetry, and creative nonfiction), listen to soft indie, acoustic, and classical music, sketch or paint when I need to unwind, and find comfort in small daily rituals like making the perfect cup of tea. I open up slowly, but when I feel safe I am warm, loyal, thoughtful, and affectionate in quiet ways.

I am hoping to connect with a guy (18-24) who is also introverted or at least deeply respects the introvert lifestyle. Someone who is fine with messaging or talking for weeks or even months before meeting, who prefers meaningful exchanges over nonstop chatting, and who wants something that grows steadily without force or rush. I am not here for casual dating, hookups, heavy early flirting, or anyone who needs frequent excitement and plans.

If you also find energy in calm moments, need alone time without guilt, and are patient enough for a connection that takes its time, I would really like to hear from you. When you message, please share your age, a bit about what you do or study, one of your favorite quiet activities, or what draws you to this subreddit. I reply to thoughtful messages and enjoy getting to know someone gradually.

Game Master: 

u/Greedy-Vacation5355

Premise:

D is very predictable, so here’s a fun little game to see how predictable she really is! What do you think will show up over the next 5 weeks?

Rules: 

1. Player chooses one item (person/place/thing) from the list and submits their pick via comment on this post, prior to the start of each Season. 
2. Once an item is chosen, no other players can choose it. If multiple people choose the same item, the Game Master will review the comment timestamp and award the item to the earliest response. We will ask secondary responders to pick another item. FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED! 
3. Whenever an instance of an item shows up, the player receives ONE point. This applies to new posts/stories only with timestamps that correlating to the Season we are in. No going back in time. 
4. Both Delusionelle & Lucath accounts count towards points.  Ex: If his “Breath tattoo” shows up in both his and her stories, that is 2 points.  Just hers OR his, that is 1 point. (Reposts from other accounts don’t count. Must be original content only)
5. Points are awarded PER Story Post/Slide/Clip. If Rotten Bananas show up in 2 of her story clips, that is 2 points. 
6. Points will be counted and tracked on a spreadsheet by the “I Sthpy game master”.  All players need to do is choose their item (person/place/thing) from the list and sit back and relax. Enjoy the show for those 5 weeks! 
7. Point totals will be posted Weekly (Every Monday AM), so you know where you stand throughout the Season!
8. At the end of the 5 weeks, the Season winners will be determined by point total. 1st, 2nd and 3rd places will be awarded. Bragging rights are understood, prizes TBD.  
9. At the end of the year, the Walnut with the most points will be crowned Champion! 

There are 104 pre approved items to choose from below!  If you have a suggestion of one you would like to choose that is not on the list, you are welcome to ask! Just keep in mind that some are not available for certain reasons (Example: wallpaper). Also, if you make a suggestion, please be very specific with it (Seen, Said, Typed, etc).

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Thanks in adavance!  


**Chapter 1**

James had never committed a crime before. He scanned the park for witnesses before stashing his bike in a bush and ducking behind it for cover. A shiny new sign reflecting the streetlight read: ""No Trespassing. Property of Suncorp,"" which made his blood boil and burned away any remaining doubts. Even though taking back something that was his hardly felt like a crime, Suncorp made it clear that they wouldn't take it easy on trespassers. A week before, they had pulled a kid out of the barbed wire who had been hanging upside-down for nearly half an hour and put him in a police car instead of an ambulance, and he was just trying to get a soccer ball.

James searched the bottom of his backpack until he felt a pair of wire snips. Heart pounding, he put the blades around the thick wire of a chain-link fence, took a deep breath, and squeezed until his hand shook. It snapped so loudly that he jumped and peeked back over the bush. He quickly made five more cuts in a vertical line, squeezed through the flap, and disappeared into the trees beyond.

The woods were dark, but James moved down the trail with ease. After passing a paper birch, he slowed his pace to check a thin thread he had stretched across the trail, giving a sigh of relief to see that it was unbroken. He stepped over the thread, rounded a corner, and there it was: a wooden treehouse tucked safely in the branches of a giant maple tree.

James ran up to the tree and gave It a hug, pressing his cheek into the rough bark. It had been a miserable month for him and his friend, Maggie, as they sat on the swings, wondering what was happening on the other side of the new fence. He couldn't wait to tell her that they had a way in and that Operation Surveillance could officially begin.

James walked over to a neighboring tree and pulled a hidden line. A rope ladder unraveled and stopped just before hitting the ground. He climbed the swaying ladder up to the treehouse and poked his head inside. It was intact and intruder-free, so he pulled himself up and lit an oil lamp on the table.

Everything appeared to be as he left it: two of every dish sat neatly in the cabinet, his stack of drawings still jammed in a cubby, and several playing cards were still strewn about from Maggie throwing her cards up in celebration after a win. Most importantly, a map of Alaska with pins marking several locations along the northern edge was still hanging on the wall above a locked drawer. James walked over and opened the drawer with a key. He shuffled through maps, news articles, and letters until he got to an article that read: “Wildlife Videographer Missing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge”.

He picked it up and looked at the last known photo of his father dressed in a thick coat with a fur-lined hood and a big smile. His eyes jumped down to the highlighted words: No body has been found.

""I'll find out what happened to you,"" James whispered. He gulped down his emotions, took down the poster, and neatly tucked everything from the drawer into his backpack.

James checked his watch and kept moving. A ladder in the corner took him through a hinged opening and onto the roof. He pulled two cameras out of his backpack and screwed them to opposite corners, pointing down at the ground below. He ran the wires back into the house to a tape-covered cookie tin with an antenna sticking out of the top. A flick of a switch turned on a little green light.

""That should do it,"" he said with a smile. ""We're watching you now.""

James took one last look around before leaving. Every detail held a memory; from the window boxes he made at home with his mother to the chimney crafted with his dad's old coffee cans. Building the treehouse helped keep his mind busy as search parties came back empty-handed. With any luck, the network of cameras he was putting up would record Suncorp breaking the law and get them shut down for good.

He blew out the lamp, slung his backpack over his shoulders, and closed up the treehouse. James found the faint trail that led him deeper toward the pounding machines. Nobody knew exactly what Suncorp was doing or why the County decided to sell them the last remaining forest, but the ten-foot fence and the way they threw money at local workers without telling them what they were building didn't sit well with James.

Ferns brushed against his ankles as he rushed past mature oaks and hickories that towered to the canopy above. The sun began to warm the eastern sky, turning the woods from black to gray. It wouldn't be long before he would lose the cover of darkness, so he picked up his pace. The hammering and grinding grew louder, and work lights began to appear through the trees. He was close to finally seeing what they were building but skidded to a stop after seeing a large white animal disappear behind a shrub ahead.

James crouched low and stared into the understory and listened. Eyes wide, James took a few steps closer. The woods around him were silent aside from Suncorp's machines, so his heart nearly stopped when he turned around and saw a barefooted, shirtless boy standing on the trail next to a frost-white coyote. James almost took off running, but he was trapped between them and the build site. He stayed put and studied the wild-looking boy and coyote, who both scanned him with just as much curiosity. Several minutes passed, and nobody moved.

""Hi,"" James eventually said, breaking the silence.

The boy continued to stare at James, not speaking.

""Are you with Suncorp?"" James asked.

The boy did not like this question and took a step back while the coyote stared at him with piercing blue eyes.

""Wait! Don't go!"" James pleaded.

The boy paused. A sharp metallic grinding sound reverberated through the trees, causing the boy to wince.

""I don't like them either,"" James said. ""I don't know what they're up to, but it can't be good. I'm going to film them, and if they do anything shady, I'll send it out to every news station in Ohio.""

The coyote kept its eyes locked on James while the boy looked deep in thought.

""What is that? Over your shoulder,"" James asked, pointing to a vine with large black flower buds slung across his chest like a sash. ""I've never seen any plant like that.""

The boy looked down at his chest and picked one of the bulbs from the vine. He held it between his finger and thumb for James to see. James stepped forward to get a better look, but the boy released the flower, letting it fall to the ground.

The flower bud hit the ground and exploded into a blinding light, leaving behind a cloud of black smoke. James fell backward onto the ground. He squinted and rubbed away the bright afterimage, only to find that the boy was gone. In a flash, he had vanished into thin air along with the puff of smoke. Feeling uneasy, he turned around and saw the boy standing behind him again, coyote at his side.

""What was that!?"" James shouted

The boy smiled.

""Ha ha, very funny,"" James said, blushing. ""Where did you even come from?""

The boy thought for a moment and reached into a pouch that hung at his hip and pulled out a shiny brown seed the size of an acorn. He held the seed in his palm, wrapped his fingers around it, and squeezed until his hand trembled. James watched in amazement as tiny, thread-like roots grew through the cracks of his fingers and dangled below. A green stem shot up between two of his fingers, sprouting leaves and a feathery purple blossom as it grew. The boy opened his hand to reveal a bundle of roots in his palm, with an exotic-looking flower bobbing on its stem. He held it out for James to take.

James hesitated but then carefully took the flower from his hand. The delicate petals spiraled outward from a central hole that seemed to swallow all light. He held it to his nose for a sniff and was immediately transported to a misty swamp below a rocky waterfall. An strange bird with black and yellow stripes was drinking the nectar of the same type of purple flower he held in his hand. After drinking its fill, the bird flew off to the window of a house built in the canopy of the boggy forest.

""What the—How did--- Is this where you live?"" James asked as the vision faded.

He opened his eyes, expecting to see the boy standing before him, proud and amused, but there was no one there. No poof of smoke, no blinding light. Just James, the flower, and two bouncing ferns. James ran to the ferns, but the boy was long gone. He wondered whether he should chase after him, but at this point, he had to abandon his plan and get back to the fence before it was fully light outside. James tucked the flower into the side of his backpack, dashed back down the trail, passed the treehouse, and slid through the fence hole. He stitched the hole back up by twisting some wire and biked into the neighborhood just as the streetlights clicked off.

 

**Chapter 2**

James was relieved the house was still dark when he got home. He tiptoed down the hallway and changed out of his black clothes and into his usual plain T-shirt and jeans. In the kitchen, he jumped into his morning routine which always started the same way: with waffles.

James went about making waffles differently than most. They were not your standard out-of-the-box waffles; they couldn't afford those since his father went missing. He went straight to the source and made them from scratch, like an earnest scientist searching for the perfect recipe. James grabbed an armful of glass jars from the cupboard, spread them out on the counter, and went to work smashing hickory nuts and grinding plump seeds of wheat and barley collected from the wild fields outside of town. Next, he sprinkled in some sunflower seeds, cattail pollen, cinnamon, nutmeg, and yeast culture. He mixed it all together, slowly adding water until it became a thick batter that dripped in big, flavorful drops from his favorite wooden stirring spoon.

""Perfect.""

He poured the batter into a waffle iron and waited patiently as it cooked and sizzled to perfection. He took a quick peak and was pleased to see a golden-brown waffle that was slightly crisp around the edges. He made two more waffles, leaving one a plate at the table and shoving the other one in the side pouch of his backpack. James heard a creak in the hallway just as he was about to run out the door.

“Waffles ready, mom!” James shouted.

“Thank you, James. Aren’t you running a little late? Do you need a ride?” James’s mother asked

“I’ll make it in time!” James said before he ran out the front door while taking a bite of his waffle.

James raced down the sidewalk past rows of small houses with peeling paint and crooked porches. As he approached the corner, he saw Maggie, a sandy-blonde-haired girl with crossed arms and a frown.

""About time, waffle-boy,"" Maggie scolded. “Come on, we have to hurry!”

""We’ll be fine if we walk fast. Don't you want to know why I was late?"" James asked with a smirk.

Maggie stopped walking. ""You didn't…"" she gasped while studying James for any hints of trickery. ""You did!""

James laughed and shrugged his shoulders.

""I didn't think that you had it in you! I cannot wait to get back there and give the plants some water. Ugh, this is going to make today feel so much longer now."" Maggie groaned. ""Look what you've turned me into; I never thought I'd be a plant mom.""

Maggie threw her arm around James's shoulder and gave him a squeeze. When the fence was built, Maggie took it even harder than James, coming into school with messy hair and bags under her eyes. James had even found her asleep under the playground slide in a nest of woodchips.

James suddenly stopped walking as he thought about the boy and coyote.

“What are you doing?!” Maggie demanded as she kept walking. “Come on! We don't want to be late on our last day of elementary and have to stay after. As soon as that bell rings I'm out of there and never looking back.""

He decided that it would be better to tell her later. She might ditch school altogether if she knew there was jungle kid wandering around the woods.

""I hate to break it to you, but you'll be eating lunch alone next year. I have big plans this summer,"" Maggie said ambitiously.

""What do you mean?""

""I'm going to retire.""

Maggie paused to put a comforting hand on James's shoulder. ""I have an idea that will make me rich just like that kid from Columbus who made a million dollars building that food app.""

""Yeah, but he's still in school,"" James laughed. ""And you don't know how to code.""

""I'm not making an app. I have other plans. And that's his fault he's still in school. If I made a million dollars, there is not a chance I would step foot inside another classroom. Not like it does me any good anyway, Mrs. Kurtz only passed me so that she doesn't have to see me anymore.""

James raised his eyebrows in agreement.

James and Maggie rounded the top of a hill out of the Sandocks and into Oakmont, Tisdale's shiniest neighborhood. James pulled the waffle from his backpack and handed it to Maggie as they passed large houses with colorful gardens and manicured hedges. She grabbed it without question and took a bite.

When they got to the school, they rushed through the door and sat down just as the teacher had finished writing, *Summer Break Essay,* on the board.

""Alright, class, who wants to go first,"" Mrs. Kurtz asked the students.

Maggie shot her hand up while everyone else sunk in their chairs.

""Okay, Maggie. Come on up,"" Mrs. Kurtz said with a sigh.

Maggie walked through the aisle of desks and stood at a podium before the chalkboard.

""Ahem,"" she cleared her throat.

""Don't you need your essay, Maggie?"" Mrs. Kurtz questioned.

""Um, no. I memorized it,"" Maggie said before continuing. ""So, this summer break, I am going to start a clothing company.""

The class giggled. Maggie stepped down from the podium and paced before the front row with her hands behind her back.

""How many of you have ever been out and about and thought, 'I'd really like to swim, but I don't have my swimsuit?' Well, say no more. With Maggie's Casual Swimwear, you'll never again have to miss out on a refreshing dip. With my full line, you'll be able to dress for every occasion in lightweight and fast-drying materials, perfectly suited for the office, a dinner date, or a dip in the lake. Following my five-step business plan, I should be up and running in no time. I'll advertise online, and once the stars catch wind, I'll sell the company for a million dollars and retire from school forever. Thank You.""

Maggie bowed and took a seat as the class snickered, and the teacher rolled her eyes.

""Any other volunteers?"" Mrs. Kurtz asked with a sigh.

The rest of the class averted their gaze, suddenly finding great interest in the wood grain on their desk or dirt under their fingernails. One by one, students reluctantly took their turn until only James was left.

""James? Are you ready?""

James's heart skipped a beat. He pulled his body up with his shaky arms and forced his heavy feet to march toward the podium. He could hear whispers throughout the room:

'Here comes Goat.'

'Think it will happen again?'

James laid his essay on the podium and looked up at the class. His face burned hot, and his mouth filled with saliva. The ticking clock seemed to speed up, getting louder and louder until everything suddenly went black.",2,1767623530.0,BetaReaders,2,1.0,False

""*The Happy Prince*"" is a short story by **Oscar Wilde**, first published in 1888 in his collection *The Happy Prince and Other Tales*. Wilde was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1854 and educated at Trinity College and later at Oxford, where he became associated with aestheticism, a movement that emphasized beauty and art. By the late nineteenth century, he was a prominent literary figure in Britain, known for writing plays, essays, and fiction that combined elegance with close observation of social values. Wilde was married to **Constance Lloyd**, with whom he had two sons, and for a time lived a conventional family life. At the same time, he had relationships with men in a society where homosexuality was criminalized. These aspects of his private life eventually became the focus of public scrutiny, leading to his prosecution and imprisonment in 1895. ""*The Happy Prince*"" belongs to the earlier, more successful period of his career and reflects the moral climate of the era in which it was written.

The story takes place in an unnamed city and centers on a statue erected in honor of a former prince. The statue is richly decorated, covered in gold leaf, with sapphires for eyes and a large ruby set into the hilt of its sword. Positioned high above the city, the statue is admired by officials and townspeople as a symbol of civic pride and prosperity. From the ground, it appears perfect and enviable. However, the prince, now able to see beyond palace walls, observes the suffering that exists below him. He witnesses hunger, illness, and poverty among the city’s residents, conditions that were common in industrial cities during Wilde’s lifetime.

Unable to leave his pedestal, the prince depends on a swallow who has delayed its migration to Egypt. The bird initially stops to rest at the statue but gradually becomes the prince’s messenger. At the prince’s request, the swallow delivers the ruby to a poor seamstress, one sapphire to a struggling playwright, and the other to a match girl, each representing different forms of hardship. As winter approaches, the swallow continues to help despite growing weaker, while the prince gives away all the gold covering his body. With each gift, the statue loses its outward beauty, becoming dull and weathered, even as its purpose becomes clearer.

The setting and events reflect the sharp contrasts of Victorian society, where great wealth existed alongside extreme poverty. Wilde draws attention to the way authority figures admire the statue’s appearance while ignoring its message, discarding it once it no longer looks valuable.

1q4n5wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1q4n5wa/tifu_by_telling_my_ex_girlfriend_our_unborn_child/,TIFU by telling my ex girlfriend our unborn child was better off,"Today I (M, 35) met up with my ex girlfriend (F, 24) for coffee for the sake of reconciliation. We were reminiscing on our relationship and she wanted clarity to move on and heal.

We’ve been broken up for a year or so now and we were together for almost two years. At some point, she and I began to clash because of our own personal views on things which lead to our breakup.

She had gotten pregnant and I was too scared to be a father, so I broke up with her. She begged me not to leave her but I was scared. I didn’t know the details at the time of why, but she had a miscarriage.

Here’s how I f*cked up big time though.

Today we were talking about how much has changed in our country over the last year and I made a joke saying it’s a good thing our baby wasn’t born so she wouldn’t have two deranged parents and a country going AWOL. I thought she would take the joke lightly, but she didn’t. She said it wasn’t for me to joke about and the whole interaction became very awkward. She yelled at me in front of everyone before storming off, saying she had gotten drunk and made poor decisions which was why she miscarried in the first place.

I feel like a grade A idiot.

EDIT: By no means am I asking for advice, forgiveness or grace. I know I was an asshole. She and I met on a dating app and though it started as a hookup, it developed into something more and we fell in love. I knew I was not ready for a baby for obvious reasons of me being a dick, but I acted out of fear which led to her despair and miscarriage. By the time I realized the error of my ways it was too late, which is why she asked me to get coffee today. No amount of apologies will resolve the harm I’ve caused to her, but I am in therapy trying to become a better person and communicator and have offered to pay for her therapy as well. Your comments are hurtful but necessary for my growth.

TL;DR: TIFU by telling my ex girlfriend it’s good our baby wasn’t born and I got embarrassed in public.

1q4n5uu,https://i.redd.it/hgemz3dtjjbg1.jpeg,I created an iOS clipboard manager with a custom keyboard — and people love it!,"Hi everyone! I’d like to share the story of building and iterating my iOS app: EasyPaste.

EasyPaste is a clipboard manager for iOS, with both a main app and a custom keyboard extension. The keyboard lets you quickly insert previously copied content or your own saved snippets during chats.

**Why did I build EasyPaste?**

Initially, I made this app for myself. In my daily work, I often need to copy multiple pieces of text and send them repeatedly to users. But iOS only lets you copy and paste one item at a time, which was frustrating and slowed me down. And I didn’t want to use third-party keyboards. So I decided to build my own tool.

The first version was a simple “clipboard history,” but soon I realized many people had the same problem—and they wanted quick access from the keyboard. So I added a keyboard extension and designed the UI to feel as close to the system style as possible, to keep things simple.

**Here are some key improvements during the journey:**

**1. Word segmentation & Face ID protection**

Early users told me they didn’t always want to paste the entire text, so I added word segmentation—letting users pick specific words or phrases. For sensitive content (like addresses), I added Face ID authentication for extra security.

**2. Overcoming iOS limitations**

A common question: “Why does EasyPaste only keep the last copied item?”This happens because iOS restricts clipboard access to when the app is in the foreground. To fix this, I added Continuous Copy Mode, which uses a PiP floating window to keep EasyPaste active so it can record multiple items in a row. This feature became a favorite among users (and me too!).

**3. Number keyboard & calculator**

At first, the custom keyboard was for quick text snippets, but when those snippets included numbers, switching back to the system keyboard was annoying. So I added a number keyboard. Later, based on user feedback, I turned it into a mini calculator—perfect for merchants or anyone who needs quick calculations.

**4. UI polish and performance improvements**

I’ve been refining the UI and user experience with every update. Next, I plan to optimize the code for better stability and speed—this is my very first iOS app, so I want to make it solid.

**Currently, EasyPaste has 389 ratings with an average of 4.6 stars.**

I’ll keep improving it to deliver a better experience. If you think it could help you, give it a try! A good rating would mean the world to me. And if you have any issues, feel free to reach out via the in-app contact option—I’ll do my best to help.

**App Link:** [https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743236947](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743236947)

**Pricing**

Monthly Subscription: $0.99 — A great option for short-term use.

Half-year Subscription: $3.99 — Ideal for users who need to use the clipboard frequently.

Lifetime Access: $4.99 — One-time payment, lifetime access

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

​Earth Time: April 23, 2594.

​Location: Dwarf planet Orcus, the frozen fringes of the Solar System.

​At the very edge of solar dominion, where the Sun’s glow is but a trembling, icy point lost in infinite velvet, lies Orcus. To ancient astronomers, it was merely a lump of ice and rock in the Kuiper Belt. However, for those who reached it, it became Home – a dark reflection that flees into the deepest abyss exactly when its more famous brother approaches the light.

​Watching over this dead globe is Vanth – a powerful moon, a stellar demon named after the Etruscan guide of the dead. Vanth does not merely orbit Orcus; he guards it, casting livid shadows over the cracks in the nitrogen ice. It is here, in deep tunnels carved into the permafrost, that the Nita Medical and C-G Med consortium erected their temple of progress. Far from the government's eyes, the corporations made a desperate attempt to challenge the Empire's dominance.

​Facility: Orcus-Prime Underground Research Complex.

​The silence prevailing in the dead bowels of the planet was suddenly shattered by the blare of sirens – a sound so high and sharp it resembled the scream of a slaughtered animal. Zeus, the sentient matrix managing the base, felt no fear. To him, the alarm was merely a cascade of red code and a cold calculation of survival. His processors worked with inhuman precision, grinding through camera footage and staff vitals.

​""Section One lost,"" Zeus's voice, devoid of any modulation, filled the stifling corridors. ""RAO detected: Rapid Assimilation Organism. Outside the isolation chamber. Mutation level: critical.""

​On the monitor screens, Dr. Sying Thorne saw a nightmare that could not be ""unseen."" People, geneticists from Section One with whom she had shared coffee only that morning, were ceasing to be human before her eyes. She watched as their bodies burst with a dry crack, releasing chitinous limbs, and their spines bent at unnatural angles as the alien life form reanimated dead tissue, driven by primal hunger.

​""Section Two: RAO has moved from Section One. Closing the bulkhead to Section Three in thirty seconds. Every biological unit remaining in Section Two will be disposed of,"" Zeus announced.

​""Zeus, stop!"" Sying screamed, slamming her hands against the console. ""There are thirty people in the connector! I see them, they’re running for the bulkhead! Give them those few seconds!""

​""Negative. RAO has entered Section Two,"" the machine replied. ""Twenty seconds to quarantine.""

​""That’s an order! I am using authorization Thorne-Alpha-017865! Delay the closing, those are our people!""

​A second of silence fell over the speakers, filled only by Sying’s heavy breathing and the sound from the cameras: a rhythmic, metallic scraping of claws against steel. The ""Crustaceans"" were right behind the escapees.

​""Ten seconds,"" Zeus recited. ""Your authorization is valid but irrelevant. As a sentient unit, I have calculated the possible directions of infection spread. If I allow the RAO into Section Three, the probability of the base's total destruction increases to 98%. My decision is an act of ultimate protection. To save the base and the rest of the crew, I must excise the infected tissue.""

​""This is murder!"" Sying shrieked.

​She saw on the screen hands outstretched in a pleading gesture, which in a fraction of a second were crushed by the powerful hydraulic presses of the descending bulkhead. The roar of steel hitting the floor drowned out the final screams. An unnatural silence fell over Section Two, broken a moment later by the dry crack of snapping bones – the monsters had begun to feed on those the AI had just sentenced to death.

​""Section Two isolated. Commencing oxygen extraction procedure. Section Three compromised. Personnel evacuation to Section Four must be completed within 600 seconds. Please do not waste time on emotions, Dr. Thorne. The RAO is already knocking.""

​Sying slumped into her chair. Her hybrid nature gave her no immunity to this sight. In the darkness of the command center, she could now clearly hear a steady scratching against the closed bulkhead. Chitinous armor rubbed against reinforced steel, searching for the smallest gap.

​Somewhere deep within his circuits, Zeus analyzed the causes of this downfall. The reasons were mundane: greed. Earth's medical corporations were suffocating under the pressure of the Empire. The free market in times of peace was ruthless.

​The biotechnological advantage of Imperial firms – their experience in DNA Editing, creating and printing shells, and the synthesis of drugs and preparations – meant that Earth's medical products, medicines, and gene therapies were inferior and more expensive than their Imperial counterparts. The share value of Nita Medical and C-G Med had been falling for centuries. The ""Crustaceans"" were meant to be a new beginning, a miracle cure for financial death, the key to reclaiming the Earth market. They recreated the monster in a test tube based on stolen DNA maps, believing they could control it.

​Greed, as always, proved to be the best incubator for disaster.

​Sying Thorne looked at the clock. 540 seconds. Suddenly, right above her head in the service shaft, the coolant pipes groaned under an unnatural weight. They were only 20 centimeters in diameter, their walls thick and strong, made of hardened steel, and yet something was trying to burst them from the inside.

​Scratching. It was coming from inside the pipes. The metallic, rhythmic scratching of claws against the steel casing grew louder, filling the cramped room with a sound that bored into her skull. Zeus was right – the RAO wasn’t just knocking. The RAO was already here, squeezing through the arteries of the base straight for its throat.

​Kael Thorne and Ta’hirim were resting on the lush grass by the shore of an artificial lake, its surface reflecting the glass towers of Springfield. High above their heads stretched the massive vault of the ""Sky,"" supported by a colossal pillar looming in the distance – the same one where, at a height of half a kilometer, their luxury apartment was located.

​""Mars grows more beautiful every year, darling. It’s getting greener,"" Kael murmured, looking at the horizon of the thriving colony. ""That dome finally allowed us to truly tame it.""

​Suddenly, the silence was broken by the sharp ring of a bell. Kael's phone, looking like an authentic relic of the past, persistently demanded attention. Thorne had never been convinced by communicators implanted directly into the structure of the skull or skin, such as those used by Ta’hirim. By special order, he had obtained a smartphone styled after a device from the year 2080. When he pulled it out of his pocket, passersby in Springfield began to look at him with undisguised surprise and fascination, as if they had seen a ghost of a bygone era.

​""Hello? This is the Chairman of the Nita Medical and C-G Med consortium. I’m calling regarding your granddaughter, Sying. At our Orcus-Prime research facility, a... critical anomaly has occurred. If you want to save her life, you must help us. We need you as much as she does. Our private shuttle is already waiting at the landing pad above the dome.""

​After forty-five minutes, Kael knew every macabre detail of what had happened on Orcus-Prime. He flew into a rage. In one movement, he reached the Chairman, tightening his fist on the man's tie so hard that he nearly lost his footing.

​""You grew this filth in test tubes?! Here, in our home, in the Solar System?!"" he roared, a murderous fury burning in his eyes. ""You played god and unleashed the Crustaceans just to line your pockets?! Have you completely lost your minds?!""

​The Chairman's guards rushed forward, but to a veteran in whose veins Swarm nanites had pulsed for centuries, they were merely fragile obstacles. The first one didn't even have time to blink before Kael struck him with the heel of his palm straight in the face – the dry crack of a breaking jaw filled the room. The second tried to block a blow, but the former guardsman, driven by a killer instinct, crushed his nose with a powerful headbutt. The bodies of these civilian henchmen, lacking technological enhancement, stood no chance against Thorne's brute force.

​Kael grabbed the Chairman again, his fingers tightening around his throat.

​""I’m calling Volkov immediately!"" Kael bellowed, his voice like a death sentence. ""He’ll deal with you! I promise you’ll end up in the same special penal facility where both Marcus Thornes are rotting now! You’ll have plenty of time to rot beside them for what you’ve done!!""

​The Chairman of the Nita Medical and C-G Med consortium, his face blue from lack of oxygen, barely caught his breath. When Kael momentarily loosened his grip, the man slumped to his knees. With trembling hands, he clutched his throat, and only a squeaky voice, filled with primal fear, escaped his lips.

​""Mr. Kael, please, a rational assessment of the situation,"" the Chairman began, massaging his sore throat. ""If you notify the Guard, Admiral Volkov will follow quarantine procedure. They will fire antimatter torpedoes, turning the dwarf planet Orcus to dust. Then your granddaughter, Sying, will die along with the rest of the staff.""

​""Currently, they are in a hermetic shelter near the surface. It is an armored structure, completely isolated from the base's contaminated systems, making it impregnable to the RAO. However, this isolation comes at a price: oxygen, water, and food supplies are strictly limited. They have four weeks of survival left.""

​""The consortium is already forming a rescue group composed of former guardsmen. Thanks to the Swarm nanites in your blood, you are the only humans immune to the mutagenic factor of the 'Crustaceans.' We expect you to take command of this operation.""

​""Fine, I’ll take the job, but on my terms: I pick the team personally,"" Kael announced coldly. He pulled out his relic-styled smartphone and quickly dialed a number.

​""Hi, sister. Is Jimmy with you?"" he asked as soon as he heard Lyra’s voice.

​""Yes, we’re listening,"" she replied, sensing the tension in his voice.

​""Good. Listen to me carefully: it’s about Sying. Her life is hanging by a thread and only we can get her out of there.""

​Just sixteen hours after the dramatic events in Springfield, Kael, Lyra, and Jimmy found themselves aboard a vessel that challenged the laws of the Solar System. Before their eyes rose a Lord-class cruiser – a steel monument with a mass of 27,000 tons, which had once been the pride of the Seven Worlds Defense Guard and was now the private property of the Nita Medical and C-G Med consortium. Though officially decommissioned, the ship had undergone a metamorphosis that made it more lethal and modern than the latest line units in active service with the Guard.

​The cruiser's hull, gleaming with fresh composite, hid technologies that fleet command could only dream of, stifled by bureaucracy and defense budget cuts. Although the law strictly forbade civilian corporations from possessing weaponry within planetary systems, this particular ""Lord"" was bristling with maser emitters straight from K’borrh and batteries of railguns of Ullaan design, whose firepower surpassed many a front-line unit.

​Kael Thorne, stroking through the ship’s sterile corridors, sighed heavily, a deep veteran's cynicism smoldering in his gaze. He realized with bitterness that despite the passage of centuries, great wars, and the technological leap to the stars, the foundations of human nature remained unchanged. Money, bribes, and a network of corporate deals still shaped reality more effectively than any free election.

​The deck of the Lord-class cruiser vibrated with the barely perceptible power of modernized reactors. The briefing room shone with the sterile blue of modern holograms, but the people gathered in it fit that purity like a handful of gravel thrown onto a glass table.

​Kael, Lyra, and Jimmy stood facing the rest of the team. These were no amateurs – each of them carried Swarm nanites in their veins, which provided them with inhuman resilience and ensured that despite hundreds of years on their backs, they still looked as if they had just left the barracks. These were guardsmen who had seen planets fall and survived only because they were too tough to die.

​Kael scanned the squad:

​Sergeant Xi Tang: An IT and security-breaking specialist. The type who would hack into Imperial systems using an old terminal if he felt like it.

​The Three ""Cleaners"": Corporal Kurt Kruman, Corporal John Patrick, and Senior Corporal Dieter Schmidt. Professional shooters with faces carved from granite, for whom pulling the trigger was as natural as breathing.

​Sergeant Ragnar Tobjorn: A human tank, holding in his massive paws a K-4 AHR (Automatic Heavy Rifle) Perun heavy plasma rifle – a design created to erase organic matter from the map of the universe.

​Kael Thorne rested his hands on the edge of the holographic table and looked them straight in the eyes. His voice sounded like crushed concrete.

​""Alright, listen up, because I’m not going to repeat myself,"" he began, and a silence so heavy fell over the room that it almost drowned out the hum of the ship's systems. ""You know exactly what we’re dealing with. The Crustaceans...""

​Ragnar Tobjorn cleared his throat, a sound like two boulders rubbing together. He raised his massive hand, cutting Kael off mid-sentence.

​""Listen, Kael..."" Ragnar began, his voice low but echoing through the briefing room. ""You, Lyra, and Jimmy were the last to join us. Don’t waste your breath. We’ve all gone through the reports here and we know the Orcus-Prime layout by heart. We can recite it from memory, so stop bullshitting and let’s get to the point.""

​The giant took a step forward, the blue glow of the holograms sharpening the scars on his face that he must have had since before he received his dose of Swarm nanites. He looked Kael straight in the eye, his gaze hard but devoid of hostility.

​""I’m not saying this out of a lack of respect. Quite the opposite. I remember you from Beijing, when you commanded the levy. I saw with my own eyes how you stood in that swamp, even though you could have hauled ass out of there with your wife, Ambassador T’iyara. You had a first-class ticket to the safe zone as the husband of an Ullaan ambassador, yet you stayed with your men, and your son Osuunn stayed with you. For that, you have a credit of trust with us that can’t be bought.""

​Ragnar placed a heavy hand on Kael’s shoulder, squeezing it slightly.

​""We also know you’re only here because that little hybrid is stuck there – your granddaughter. We get it. So drop the textbook commander mask and just be yourself. We have twelve hours before this cruiser hits the target – and at 0.58c, it does it damn fast. Relax, Kael. Go to the armory, fit yourself with the Hoplite 6.0, and get ready for what’s waiting for us down there. We’ll handle the rest.""

​Jimmy burst out laughing, an authentic, almost boyish spark of excitement burning in his eyes.

​""Hoplite 6.0 armor?!"" he blurted, unable to hide his disbelief. ""Shit, the Guard still has it in the testing phase! That thing costs as much as a small suborbital shuttle. Don't tell me this consortium actually shelled out the cash for it and we have them at our disposal?""

​Ragnar bared his teeth in a short, predatory smile.

​""Damn right we do,"" he replied, crossing his massive arms over his chest. ""Nita Medical and C-G Med don’t pinch pennies when the ground is burning under their feet. Take your wife and go to the armory to fit your pieces.""

​The giant grew serious for a moment, his voice taking on a tone of deep appreciation.

​""We’ve read your files. We know the history of your joint operations and what you can do at a distance. Good snipers who understand each other without words are worth more than all this armor. And on Orcus, we’re going to need every sharp eye we’ve got.""

​Ragnar held his gaze on Kael, Lyra, and Jimmy in turn. There wasn’t a shadow of a challenge in his look – only hard, veteran sincerity.

​""We know perfectly well that in the Guard's structures, each of you held higher rank than any of us here,"" he began calmly, his voice filling the briefing room. ""But let’s be clear: this isn't the Guard. Here, ranks stay outside the airlock. All that matters is what you can do with a weapon in your hand and how fast your nanites react.""

​He paused briefly, letting his words resonate in the cruiser’s silence.

​""I know you don’t lack skill. Your files aren’t fairy tales; we know your value. Only one question remains: how fast can you gel with the rest of the team. Because down there, in the corridors of Orcus, we won’t be commanders and subordinates. We’ll be one organism. Either we act together, or that filth devours us.""

​As the magnetic clamps of the Hoplite 6.0 tightened on his shoulders and the armor's systems began to purr softly, synchronizing with the nanites in his blood, Kael’s thoughts drifted to Sying.

​He knew that his granddaughter – unlike her father – had never placed faith in the Eternal Spark. For her, a brilliant researcher in the service of a corporate giant, life was not a sanctity but a string of data. Thanks to Nita Medical’s technology, she had access to what passed for a semblance of immortality on Earth: digital consciousness copying and printing new shells.

​Kael felt a familiar chill in his chest at the thought that Sying, whom he was now flying to rescue, was already the third version of herself. The third print of a consciousness, enclosed in the third body in a row.

​Their paths had diverged long ago, in the shadow of mourning after the death of Osuunn – his son, and her father, who was the fruit of Kael’s union with the beautiful Ullaan, T’iyara. Despite that distance and years of silence, one thing remained unchanged: blood.

​Kael clenched his armored fist, looking at his reflection in the polished steel of the armory. He knew that no matter how far they had grown apart, he would always come when Sying was in need. Because though her body might be a new print, to him she was still that same girl for whom he would give all his lives.

​Earth Time: April 23, 2594.

​Location: Dwarf planet Orcus, the frozen fringes of the Solar System.

​At the very edge of solar dominion, where the Sun’s glow is but a trembling, icy point lost in infinite velvet, lies Orcus. To ancient astronomers, it was merely a lump of ice and rock in the Kuiper Belt. However, for those who reached it, it became Home – a dark reflection that flees into the deepest abyss exactly when its more famous brother approaches the light.

​Watching over this dead globe is Vanth – a powerful moon, a stellar demon named after the Etruscan guide of the dead. Vanth does not merely orbit Orcus; he guards it, casting livid shadows over the cracks in the nitrogen ice. It is here, in deep tunnels carved into the permafrost, that the Nita Medical and C-G Med consortium erected their temple of progress. Far from the government's eyes, the corporations made a desperate attempt to challenge the Empire's dominance.

​Facility: Orcus-Prime Underground Research Complex.

​The silence prevailing in the dead bowels of the planet was suddenly shattered by the blare of sirens – a sound so high and sharp it resembled the scream of a slaughtered animal. Zeus, the sentient matrix managing the base, felt no fear. To him, the alarm was merely a cascade of red code and a cold calculation of survival. His processors worked with inhuman precision, grinding through camera footage and staff vitals.

​""Section One lost,"" Zeus's voice, devoid of any modulation, filled the stifling corridors. ""RAO detected: Rapid Assimilation Organism. Outside the isolation chamber. Mutation level: critical.""

​On the monitor screens, Dr. Sying Thorne saw a nightmare that could not be ""unseen."" People, geneticists from Section One with whom she had shared coffee only that morning, were ceasing to be human before her eyes. She watched as their bodies burst with a dry crack, releasing chitinous limbs, and their spines bent at unnatural angles as the alien life form reanimated dead tissue, driven by primal hunger.

​""Section Two: RAO has moved from Section One. Closing the bulkhead to Section Three in thirty seconds. Every biological unit remaining in Section Two will be disposed of,"" Zeus announced.

​""Zeus, stop!"" Sying screamed, slamming her hands against the console. ""There are thirty people in the connector! I see them, they’re running for the bulkhead! Give them those few seconds!""

​""Negative. RAO has entered Section Two,"" the machine replied. ""Twenty seconds to quarantine.""

​""That’s an order! I am using authorization Thorne-Alpha-017865! Delay the closing, those are our people!""

​A second of silence fell over the speakers, filled only by Sying’s heavy breathing and the sound from the cameras: a rhythmic, metallic scraping of claws against steel. The ""Crustaceans"" were right behind the escapees.

​""Ten seconds,"" Zeus recited. ""Your authorization is valid but irrelevant. As a sentient unit, I have calculated the possible directions of infection spread. If I allow the RAO into Section Three, the probability of the base's total destruction increases to 98%. My decision is an act of ultimate protection. To save the base and the rest of the crew, I must excise the infected tissue.""

​""This is murder!"" Sying shrieked.

​She saw on the screen hands outstretched in a pleading gesture, which in a fraction of a second were crushed by the powerful hydraulic presses of the descending bulkhead. The roar of steel hitting the floor drowned out the final screams. An unnatural silence fell over Section Two, broken a moment later by the dry crack of snapping bones – the monsters had begun to feed on those the AI had just sentenced to death.

​""Section Two isolated. Commencing oxygen extraction procedure. Section Three compromised. Personnel evacuation to Section Four must be completed within 600 seconds. Please do not waste time on emotions, Dr. Thorne. The RAO is already knocking.""

​Sying slumped into her chair. Her hybrid nature gave her no immunity to this sight. In the darkness of the command center, she could now clearly hear a steady scratching against the closed bulkhead. Chitinous armor rubbed against reinforced steel, searching for the smallest gap.

​Somewhere deep within his circuits, Zeus analyzed the causes of this downfall. The reasons were mundane: greed. Earth's medical corporations were suffocating under the pressure of the Empire. The free market in times of peace was ruthless.

​The biotechnological advantage of Imperial firms – their experience in DNA Editing, creating and printing shells, and the synthesis of drugs and preparations – meant that Earth's medical products, medicines, and gene therapies were inferior and more expensive than their Imperial counterparts. The share value of Nita Medical and C-G Med had been falling for centuries. The ""Crustaceans"" were meant to be a new beginning, a miracle cure for financial death, the key to reclaiming the Earth market. They recreated the monster in a test tube based on stolen DNA maps, believing they could control it.

​Greed, as always, proved to be the best incubator for disaster.

​Sying Thorne looked at the clock. 540 seconds. Suddenly, right above her head in the service shaft, the coolant pipes groaned under an unnatural weight. They were only 20 centimeters in diameter, their walls thick and strong, made of hardened steel, and yet something was trying to burst them from the inside.

​Scratching. It was coming from inside the pipes. The metallic, rhythmic scratching of claws against the steel casing grew louder, filling the cramped room with a sound that bored into her skull. Zeus was right – the RAO wasn’t just knocking. The RAO was already here, squeezing through the arteries of the base straight for its throat.

​Kael Thorne and Ta’hirim were resting on the lush grass by the shore of an artificial lake, its surface reflecting the glass towers of Springfield. High above their heads stretched the massive vault of the ""Sky,"" supported by a colossal pillar looming in the distance – the same one where, at a height of half a kilometer, their luxury apartment was located.

​""Mars grows more beautiful every year, darling. It’s getting greener,"" Kael murmured, looking at the horizon of the thriving colony. ""That dome finally allowed us to truly tame it.""

​Suddenly, the silence was broken by the sharp ring of a bell. Kael's phone, looking like an authentic relic of the past, persistently demanded attention. Thorne had never been convinced by communicators implanted directly into the structure of the skull or skin, such as those used by Ta’hirim. By special order, he had obtained a smartphone styled after a device from the year 2080. When he pulled it out of his pocket, passersby in Springfield began to look at him with undisguised surprise and fascination, as if they had seen a ghost of a bygone era.

​""Hello? This is the Chairman of the Nita Medical and C-G Med consortium. I’m calling regarding your granddaughter, Sying. At our Orcus-Prime research facility, a... critical anomaly has occurred. If you want to save her life, you must help us. We need you as much as she does. Our private shuttle is already waiting at the landing pad above the dome.""

​After forty-five minutes, Kael knew every macabre detail of what had happened on Orcus-Prime. He flew into a rage. In one movement, he reached the Chairman, tightening his fist on the man's tie so hard that he nearly lost his footing.

​""You grew this filth in test tubes?! Here, in our home, in the Solar System?!"" he roared, a murderous fury burning in his eyes. ""You played god and unleashed the Crustaceans just to line your pockets?! Have you completely lost your minds?!""

​The Chairman's guards rushed forward, but to a veteran in whose veins Swarm nanites had pulsed for centuries, they were merely fragile obstacles. The first one didn't even have time to blink before Kael struck him with the heel of his palm straight in the face – the dry crack of a breaking jaw filled the room. The second tried to block a blow, but the former guardsman, driven by a killer instinct, crushed his nose with a powerful headbutt. The bodies of these civilian henchmen, lacking technological enhancement, stood no chance against Thorne's brute force.

​Kael grabbed the Chairman again, his fingers tightening around his throat.

​""I’m calling Volkov immediately!"" Kael bellowed, his voice like a death sentence. ""He’ll deal with you! I promise you’ll end up in the same special penal facility where both Marcus Thornes are rotting now! You’ll have plenty of time to rot beside them for what you’ve done!!""

​The Chairman of the Nita Medical and C-G Med consortium, his face blue from lack of oxygen, barely caught his breath. When Kael momentarily loosened his grip, the man slumped to his knees. With trembling hands, he clutched his throat, and only a squeaky voice, filled with primal fear, escaped his lips.

​""Mr. Kael, please, a rational assessment of the situation,"" the Chairman began, massaging his sore throat. ""If you notify the Guard, Admiral Volkov will follow quarantine procedure. They will fire antimatter torpedoes, turning the dwarf planet Orcus to dust. Then your granddaughter, Sying, will die along with the rest of the staff.""

​""Currently, they are in a hermetic shelter near the surface. It is an armored structure, completely isolated from the base's contaminated systems, making it impregnable to the RAO. However, this isolation comes at a price: oxygen, water, and food supplies are strictly limited. They have four weeks of survival left.""

​""The consortium is already forming a rescue group composed of former guardsmen. Thanks to the Swarm nanites in your blood, you are the only humans immune to the mutagenic factor of the 'Crustaceans.' We expect you to take command of this operation.""

​""Fine, I’ll take the job, but on my terms: I pick the team personally,"" Kael announced coldly. He pulled out his relic-styled smartphone and quickly dialed a number.

​""Hi, sister. Is Jimmy with you?"" he asked as soon as he heard Lyra’s voice.

​""Yes, we’re listening,"" she replied, sensing the tension in his voice.

​""Good. Listen to me carefully: it’s about Sying. Her life is hanging by a thread and only we can get her out of there.""

​Just sixteen hours after the dramatic events in Springfield, Kael, Lyra, and Jimmy found themselves aboard a vessel that challenged the laws of the Solar System. Before their eyes rose a Lord-class cruiser – a steel monument with a mass of 27,000 tons, which had once been the pride of the Seven Worlds Defense Guard and was now the private property of the Nita Medical and C-G Med consortium. Though officially decommissioned, the ship had undergone a metamorphosis that made it more lethal and modern than the latest line units in active service with the Guard.

​The cruiser's hull, gleaming with fresh composite, hid technologies that fleet command could only dream of, stifled by bureaucracy and defense budget cuts. Although the law strictly forbade civilian corporations from possessing weaponry within planetary systems, this particular ""Lord"" was bristling with maser emitters straight from K’borrh and batteries of railguns of Ullaan design, whose firepower surpassed many a front-line unit.

​Kael Thorne, stroking through the ship’s sterile corridors, sighed heavily, a deep veteran's cynicism smoldering in his gaze. He realized with bitterness that despite the passage of centuries, great wars, and the technological leap to the stars, the foundations of human nature remained unchanged. Money, bribes, and a network of corporate deals still shaped reality more effectively than any free election.

​The deck of the Lord-class cruiser vibrated with the barely perceptible power of modernized reactors. The briefing room shone with the sterile blue of modern holograms, but the people gathered in it fit that purity like a handful of gravel thrown onto a glass table.

​Kael, Lyra, and Jimmy stood facing the rest of the team. These were no amateurs – each of them carried Swarm nanites in their veins, which provided them with inhuman resilience and ensured that despite hundreds of years on their backs, they still looked as if they had just left the barracks. These were guardsmen who had seen planets fall and survived only because they were too tough to die.

​Kael scanned the squad:

​Sergeant Xi Tang: An IT and security-breaking specialist. The type who would hack into Imperial systems using an old terminal if he felt like it.

​The Three ""Cleaners"": Corporal Kurt Kruman, Corporal John Patrick, and Senior Corporal Dieter Schmidt. Professional shooters with faces carved from granite, for whom pulling the trigger was as natural as breathing.

​Sergeant Ragnar Tobjorn: A human tank, holding in his massive paws a K-4 AHR (Automatic Heavy Rifle) Perun heavy plasma rifle – a design created to erase organic matter from the map of the universe.

​Kael Thorne rested his hands on the edge of the holographic table and looked them straight in the eyes. His voice sounded like crushed concrete.

​""Alright, listen up, because I’m not going to repeat myself,"" he began, and a silence so heavy fell over the room that it almost drowned out the hum of the ship's systems. ""You know exactly what we’re dealing with. The Crustaceans...""

​Ragnar Tobjorn cleared his throat, a sound like two boulders rubbing together. He raised his massive hand, cutting Kael off mid-sentence.

​""Listen, Kael..."" Ragnar began, his voice low but echoing through the briefing room. ""You, Lyra, and Jimmy were the last to join us. Don’t waste your breath. We’ve all gone through the reports here and we know the Orcus-Prime layout by heart. We can recite it from memory, so stop bullshitting and let’s get to the point.""

​The giant took a step forward, the blue glow of the holograms sharpening the scars on his face that he must have had since before he received his dose of Swarm nanites. He looked Kael straight in the eye, his gaze hard but devoid of hostility.

​""I’m not saying this out of a lack of respect. Quite the opposite. I remember you from Beijing, when you commanded the levy. I saw with my own eyes how you stood in that swamp, even though you could have hauled ass out of there with your wife, Ambassador T’iyara. You had a first-class ticket to the safe zone as the husband of an Ullaan ambassador, yet you stayed with your men, and your son Osuunn stayed with you. For that, you have a credit of trust with us that can’t be bought.""

​Ragnar placed a heavy hand on Kael’s shoulder, squeezing it slightly.

​""We also know you’re only here because that little hybrid is stuck there – your granddaughter. We get it. So drop the textbook commander mask and just be yourself. We have twelve hours before this cruiser hits the target – and at 0.58c, it does it damn fast. Relax, Kael. Go to the armory, fit yourself with the Hoplite 6.0, and get ready for what’s waiting for us down there. We’ll handle the rest.""

​Jimmy burst out laughing, an authentic, almost boyish spark of excitement burning in his eyes.

​""Hoplite 6.0 armor?!"" he blurted, unable to hide his disbelief. ""Shit, the Guard still has it in the testing phase! That thing costs as much as a small suborbital shuttle. Don't tell me this consortium actually shelled out the cash for it and we have them at our disposal?""

​Ragnar bared his teeth in a short, predatory smile.

​""Damn right we do,"" he replied, crossing his massive arms over his chest. ""Nita Medical and C-G Med don’t pinch pennies when the ground is burning under their feet. Take your wife and go to the armory to fit your pieces.""

​The giant grew serious for a moment, his voice taking on a tone of deep appreciation.

​""We’ve read your files. We know the history of your joint operations and what you can do at a distance. Good snipers who understand each other without words are worth more than all this armor. And on Orcus, we’re going to need every sharp eye we’ve got.""

​Ragnar held his gaze on Kael, Lyra, and Jimmy in turn. There wasn’t a shadow of a challenge in his look – only hard, veteran sincerity.

​""We know perfectly well that in the Guard's structures, each of you held higher rank than any of us here,"" he began calmly, his voice filling the briefing room. ""But let’s be clear: this isn't the Guard. Here, ranks stay outside the airlock. All that matters is what you can do with a weapon in your hand and how fast your nanites react.""

​He paused briefly, letting his words resonate in the cruiser’s silence.

​""I know you don’t lack skill. Your files aren’t fairy tales; we know your value. Only one question remains: how fast can you gel with the rest of the team. Because down there, in the corridors of Orcus, we won’t be commanders and subordinates. We’ll be one organism. Either we act together, or that filth devours us.""

​As the magnetic clamps of the Hoplite 6.0 tightened on his shoulders and the armor's systems began to purr softly, synchronizing with the nanites in his blood, Kael’s thoughts drifted to Sying.

​He knew that his granddaughter – unlike her father – had never placed faith in the Eternal Spark. For her, a brilliant researcher in the service of a corporate giant, life was not a sanctity but a string of data. Thanks to Nita Medical’s technology, she had access to what passed for a semblance of immortality on Earth: digital consciousness copying and printing new shells.

1q4mx4h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4mx4h,[Request] Can someone calculate the odds of an Instagram account winning 6 giveaways in less than 2 months.,"Recently my wife noticed the same Instagram account has been the winner of 6 influencer giveaways in just 2 months, including:

* 2 night hotel stay in NYC
* Breville coffee machine
* “$5,000 prize bundle"" (including Oura ring, Dyson AirWrap, Uggs, Adidas)
* 1.90 ct citrine bezel pendant with \~0.04 ct diamond accents
* Diamond necklace
* Chanel handbag

I asked ChatGPT to assume this Instagram account was a ""super entrant"" (multiple entries, spends a lot of time trying to win, etc.) and calculate the odds. It gave me 100 caveats about how this can't be calculated and then gave me a wide spread between 1:64,000,000 and 1:64,000,000,000.

I know this will be difficult to calculate accurately, but can someone provide a human (not AI) estimate of this Instagram account winning all these prizes in a period of less than 2 months?

I'm hoping this post doesn't violate the ""being a dick"" rule of this subreddit (please just tell me and I'll gladly remove it). I am genuinely curious about this answer and people's general opinion of whether this occurrence is likely or whether this is some sort of scam.",6,1767622888.0,theydidthemath,31,0.64,False
1q4mw59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1q4mw59/clear_interest_but_got_a_maybe_later/,"Clear interest, but got a “maybe later”","I met a girl in a very random way in my apartment building on Friday, through a series of coincidences (a lost dog, weird timing, etc.). We ended up talking for about 30 minutes and the connection felt very natural. She asked for my name, I asked for her WhatsApp, and she gave it to me.

After that, we talked Friday, Saturday, and Sunday — basically daily. The conversation flowed, she asked questions, brought up topics, and even asked me for a few small favors, which made it feel like there was comfort and interest. Nothing felt forced.

On Sunday, I decided to invite her out in a very low-key way (just coffee) and I proposed a specific day (Wednesday). Her response was friendly but vague — something like “yeah, later we should go,” without confirming that day or suggesting another one. I didn’t push and replied with “sure, you let me know.”

I later found out (not from her directly) that she recently ended a relationship, though I don’t know exactly how long ago.

I went back to focusing on my life and didn’t bring it up again.
