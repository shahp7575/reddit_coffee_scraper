I'm doing a preliminary panel with my SM and DM next week before they schedule my coffee master panel. I'm doing the Milano roasts bc they're new and they're fun to work with. For the Luna I'm doing French press paired with cherry cordials. For the Sole  I *wanted* to do a chicken, tomato, and pesto wrap and the coffee served over ice. I was thinking it's lunch (a wrap and iced coffee) and a dessert (hot coffee with something sweet).

My husband thinks the wrap will overpower the flavors of the coffee, and suggests I have a good backup plan. My other thought was a creme brulee croissant but that'll be two desserts. What are your guys' thoughts on the pairings I've chosen? Obviously I will be trying it but I live 40 minutes away from nearest society so it's not an easy thing to just do it if I don't have the ingredients ready. I'm mostly wondering if it's worth buying the ingredients for the wrap if everyone else agrees that it'll be overpowering.",1,1727971869.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

Hope you all are happy and healthy.

Reposting for visibility - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 2 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am just looking for a connection - be it only friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but the latter is not going so well as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within day-trip distances.

1fvbclu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1fvbclu/histamine_intolerance_came_on_quickly_trying_to/,Histamine intolerance came on quickly - trying to figure out why,"Hi everybody, I've been lurking in this subreddit for a month or so now, and have gotten some really fascinating insights and tips for navigating what I think is HI, but not sure.

I wanted to share my symptoms/history here to see if anyone here has experienced anything similar (namely, increased HI coming seemingly out of nowhere), and hopefully get on a road to recovery. Sorry in advance for the long post!

---

Brief background: I've always had sensitivities to certain foods, with various reactions: 

* Tree nut allergy since childhood - swelling and itching in mouth, thankfully never needed an epipen although I have one. More recently, a few bad reactions to nuts have resulted in intense abdominal cramps and vomiting.
* Dark chocolate, coffee, processed foods, nitrate-heavy foods - in my teens and 20s these gave me frequent migraines with aura, but I was able to identify and cut them out, and all but eliminated my migraines in my 30s.
* Sensitivity to banana and avocado - abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting if I have too much.

These have always been manageable for me! But I've only recently realized that all these foods have high histamine in common, and aren't random sensitivities like I'd previously thought.

Anyway, in the past month I've experienced an onslaught of all of the above symptoms, from foods I'd previously eaten with no issues. For example, after eating a southwestern salad I experienced bad stomach cramps; after a dish of enchiladas I was dealing with nausea, vomiting, and migraine for hours (I grew up in SoCal, so Mexican food has always been a staple!). Even my morning tea and basic PB&J sandwiches gave me fatigue and stomachaches.

Based on what I've learned in this subreddit, I've gone on a self-imposed elimination diet, and I seem to be tolerating the ""safe"" foods from the SIGHI list pretty well. But this week I slipped up and got what I thought was a safe chicken cauliflower rice bowl from a local restaurant, and had a really bad reaction (I have to assume it was the seasoning on the chicken, or maybe cauliflower is actually a trigger for me?). Anyway, lesson learned: I won't be eating out anytime soon.

I'm just trying to figure out why this has gotten so much worse so quickly, and with so many more foods. A few suspected reasons:

*  I got Covid for the first time in July, and also experienced heightened immune responses from the vaccine (full torso rash that was scary looking but didn't itch or hurt at all). So I suspect my immune system is a bit out of wack. Curious why the intolerances to food took a couple months to show up though...
* I normally live in a very mild, cool climate, but spent the month of September in 80-100 degree weather. I know environment/heat can exacerbate HI, but now I'm back home and still experiencing the same symptoms.
* Vitamin deficiency - I'm hoping to get some tests done soon. I have noticed that when I take 1000mg of Vitamin C I feel much better and seem able to tolerate more foods.

Any insight is much appreciated! I have already gotten a ton of great info from this community just by reading, so thank you all. <3",1,1727971507.0,HistamineIntolerance,0,1.0,False

Really the only things affected for food are basically coffee seafood and banana and some other exotic fruits. Besides coffee I don't think most Americans care that much about those. They aren't that important for the average American diet.

The strike will hurt other countries who rely on American exports more than it will hurt Americans.

This would be from the perspective of someone who has worked full-time since high school, could not get an internship due to not being able to afford to work for free, had 0 family support, but has 3 years of experience and started a freelance practice to make up for the missing internship ongoing for 8 years now.
It blows. Not that I am going to stop trying to find work; reaching out or my network, updating my portfolio, etc, but the market now really sucks. I am in a highly populated city that has new jobs come up every so often but from my background I have come across some few points. these are my personal opinions and not universal truths, I just want to share my experience with what I have been told and that I have realized:
- if you didn't have an internship from a well known place, it will be harder to find work.
- if you live in a big city, you can spend so much on trying to network like coffee meeting and such to little to no progress 
- Younger professionals don't often have the time or experience to meet with you, let alone help you.
- Older professional often give advice that is unrealistic in the current state. For example, I have been told to build working relationships on LinkedIn and comment on people's birthdays and job updates. I have been doing such for months to no avail. The parasocial relationship has developed where that's just regular interaction and won't necessarily lead to recommendations.
- We already have a lot on our plate in the job market having to update a portfolio, make cover letters for each company, tailor resumes to the industry/job postings, sometimes making a PDF version of your portfolio as well as a web version. if you have a full-time job on top of that you will be exhausted.
- Even if your sketching is praised by professional, and people reach out to you for advice on 3d modeling, that still won't guarantee work.
- New people are almost required to be named in a competition for IDSA or publicly recognition in someway to have the best of the best.

That is to say that there is a clear divide that happens around if you can or can't get an internship and that is very often depending on your income. This becomes a class divide in our industry that has become very apparent for me. So my advice is that if you are in a similar situation, make sure this is the industry you want to be in and the work you love doing. I am always going to want to make things for people that they can rely on and bond with and that keeps me trying. 
I'd like to hear from others with similar experiences, such as starting into this industry from lower income, and what it was like for you.",1,1727971461.0,IndustrialDesign,0,1.0,False

1fvbar6,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1fvbar6/party_back/,Party Back,"Vent first, asking for advice second: 

I share a wall with a roommate — let’s call her B. B works in nightlife and has a completely different schedule from me. I’m a student, and I’m very serious about my studies. Recipe for disaster, I know. 
I tried to stick to a 7 am - 12 am sleep schedule, but it became impossible, as B has a 5 pm - 6 am schedule. I also suffer from sleep apnea, so every external sleep interruption makes me feel like DEATH the next day. After the first month, I figured out a way to sleep through the night using a sleep machine and a pillow over the head, but there’s another problem. 

She’s been having friends over that also have the same schedule, and they stay for like 2 nights at a time. They all work together, I think, so they have the same schedule. They listen to music and talk and drink and cook dinner together. It would be cute and I wouldn’t mind if our walls weren’t paper thin and they weren’t gossiping loudly over music at 4:30 in the morning. I asked her in person after the 4:30 night (which was a week day — not that that matters) to keep the noise level down after midnight. She basically complained about the walls being thin , saying “we’re just talking and listening to music”. Like obviously. I can hear you. 

Whatever, she starts to put the music lower, like I ask. But soon after that, she goes out of town for a while and the problem is pushed to the side. When she’s gone, we get roaches. Here’s something I didn’t mention: when she has friends over and they cook dinner, they don’t clean the dishes. So the sink will be COMPLETELY full for days. And she leaves  food out on the stove. It’s gross. I’m not one to do other peoples dishes. I cook, do mine, leave. But when the sink is full, I have to start piling dishes in my room. 

Now she’s back and it’s started again. No waking moment is peaceful. Also, her schedule changes when friends come over so I can’t schedule study time around that. I’m spending money on eating out cause there’s no space to cook or clean. Or because they take over the common areas and it’s awkward to cook then. I’m spending money getting coffee and drinks at quiet spots around town in order to get PEACE. The library is an option, but it’s no good for the evening. 

What do I say? I’m trying to be respectful — I get that living in a place with thin walls sucks for your lifestyle. I get that it’s hard to find folks with the same schedule as you (giving her the benefit of doubt that she’s tried). What I don’t understand is how she’s so inconsiderate. I bring up issues, she deflects. She’s really nice and lets me use her kitchen gear, but I chose not to live in a dorm so I could avoid the party scene. 

She doesn’t answer the group chat or her phone very often, so she might not even know about the roaches. and talking to her in person is difficult with our schedules and the fact that she has friends over rn. 

Also I did confront her ab the dishes - saying “theres no room for anyone else to do their dishes” and she did them after a few hours, but they still pile up and the cycle continues. I feel like I’m in a frat house. I never mention how disgusted I am with this habit. 

TLDR: I’m exhausted cause my roommate brings the party home and treats common areas like her own personal space. More, she leaves food out and no space to do dishes. How do I ask nicely for her to be considerate and make it stick? ",1,1727971384.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

","I am currently considering going to school to become an occupational therapy assistant but I’m feeling really nervous. I used to work as a CNA and absolutely loved what I did. I then went to nursing school before dropping out because of my declining mental health. I have gone to a lot of therapy since then and am in a better place as far as depression goes but my anxiety has been pretty bad the past couple years. 

I work at a coffee shop now and can be a bit quiet and anxious with all the new people around everyday. But, I think part of the reason I stay that way is because it’s not something I care about. When I worked as a CNA or even a nanny that anxiety faded away over time because I loved and believed in what I was doing. I feel like those times in my life were the happiest and most myself I’ve ever felt in a job. I plan to keep taking medication and going to therapy to manage my anxiety..  

I think part of the thing that scares me is having so much responsibility and needing to talk with confidence. I’m always second guessing myself and making myself shrink/ feel small. It feels like I can’t take myself seriously. I have this idea that I’m not put together enough to be able to help with other people like that… especially since OT sometimes helps with social skills. I want to believe I can do more than I’m telling myself but I’m scared. I have a deep respect for myself and all I’ve been through but my self esteem is low. I think I have Autism and ADHD and I’m thinking I may get tested soon. I’m wondering if maybe knowing that about myself and then going to therapy with the full picture could help me understand myself better and gain some confidence. 

Anyone have a similar experience? Would you recommend healthcare? Anyone specifically work in OT? I’m struggling to figure out what I want to do because I feel like I need to feel passionate/ care deeply about it so I’ll be motivated to keep doing it.  I’ve also noticed that in the past, the more social I would get, the less scared I would become over time.

1fvb8w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1fvb8w2/the_psychology_behind_a_sense_of_entitlement/,The Psychology Behind A Sense Of Entitlement,"""Self entitled refers to individuals who **possess an inflated sense of their own importance and believe they inherently deserve special treatment and privileges without corresponding effort or merit.**

# What does it mean to have a sense of entitlement?

A [sense of entitlement](https://spsp.org/news-center/character-context-blog/entitled-people-what-expect-and-how-deal-them#:~:text=The%20sources%20of%20entitlement%20are%20not%20fully%20understood%2C%20but%20researchers%20have%20pointed%20to%20factors%20such%20as%20how%20people%20are%20treated%20by%20their%20parents%20and%20other%20authority%20figures%2C%20messages%20from%20the%20media%2C%20and%20other%20life%20events%2C%20especially%20those%20that%20make%20people%20feel%20that%20they%20are%20special.) is a personality trait that is based on a person’s belief that they deserve privileges or recognition for things that they did not earn. People experiencing this sense tend to believe that the world owes them something in exchange for nothing.

# Signs that someone has a sense of entitlement

A person who has a sense of entitlement may come across as having extreme self-confidence or a belief that they should benefit from any given situation. 

**When someone with a sense of entitlement doesn’t get what they want, they may lash out at others in anger or frustration. Their attitude may fluctuate often, especially when things don’t go their way.**

# Understanding the psychology behind a sense of entitlement

There are several theories regarding why some people may develop a sense of entitlement. Below, we’ll discuss some of them in depth.

# The spoiled child

Parents naturally want their children to be happy, confident, and fulfilled. This can be a healthy and natural urge, but when parents make the mistake of always saying ""yes"" to their kids, it can gradually instill a sense of entitlement. 

This type of behavior, which is often allowed during early childhood, may cause impressionable children to believe that these sacrifices are acceptable patterns and behaviors throughout life. Children who are always given what they want and are not required to earn rewards for good behavior may become adults who expect others to cave to their demands. As adults, they may not know how to effectively communicate with others, and they may have trouble developing healthy relationships or maintaining stable employment.

# An attempt to overcompensate for past wrongs

In some cases, after experiencing maltreatment, unfairness, or neglect, some people develop an entitled attitude. For example, a child who is deprived of love and affection may grow up to demand it from others because they did not receive it at a young age. A teenager who never got picked to be on the All-Star Team may eventually grow up to believe they should coach a team with only the best players and may become upset if someone who is not an exceptional athlete is allowed on the team. 

# Personality disorders

For some, a sense of entitlement may be the result of a personality disorder, such as narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) or antisocial personality disorder (ASPD).

[Personality disorders](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9636-personality-disorders-overview) are typically characterized by altered views of oneself and others. People with NPD or other personality disorders may perceive themselves as superior to others, have a skewed view of the value of other people’s worth, and may not like following rules. They may exhibit an elevated sense of self-worth or an exaggerated façade of self-esteem.""

We have all had unfortunate encounters with entitled men OLP and IRL. They are much older, unkempt, hobosexuals, looking for a nurse and a purse and the list goes on. Men feel entitled to shoot their shot with women and it is both terrifying and insulting. How many times have you heard a man say he was just shooting his shot? These same men are then angry that women are no longer accommodating these attempts (they know they just don't care). Since men overestimate their appearance and their dateability there is no escape. I am grateful for the #MeToo movement and some reduction of in person harassment, yes men it is harassment when we decide not to engage and you continue, you are not entitled to our time and attention. 

Even when we clearly list in our profile what we are looking for men feel entitled to contact us (a like or a message), they are saying they do not care what we want, it does not matter. Any man that tramples over your needs is entitled, any man who bypasses consent is entitled (and an abuser), any man that knows you are not interested but continues (because how can women really know what they want?) is entitled. I have spent years working on my self esteem and it still does not compare to the entitlement of a mediocre man.  

These men never offer a fraction of what they are looking for in dating, just bumbling through life leaving a trail of destruction. They are worried about paying for a coffee and have the EQ and social skills of a toddler. These men will use you for your emotional labor, always taking and never reciprocating. Women cannot have any wants or needs, your purpose is only to make their lives better, you will pay dearly with these men. 

Men are the ones OLP that only message the most attractive women, everything they accuse women of doing they do, it is projection.

They are scared of gold diggers but have no gold, they tell women they hit the wall at a certain age but they have hit a concrete wall. The backlash of women now having standards and not being tied to men for survival is highlighted with the large number of women deciding not to date, men are mad that women are voluntarily single because they are not.  A new projection is that in 6 years 45% of women age 25-44 will be single and childless and that number will increase 1.2% every year. [https://medium.com/the-savanna-post/45-of-women-estimated-to-be-single-and-childless-by-2030-1faf959b26cf](https://medium.com/the-savanna-post/45-of-women-estimated-to-be-single-and-childless-by-2030-1faf959b26cf)  When women have economic freedom and choice they choose not to couple.

She has been on my ass to date since I’ve only had one relationship for a year in college and none since. I would like to find someone but I’ve just never found anyone I would be interested in. I’ve done the online dating thing but it was exhausting and demoralizing. She has a friend who has a daughter my age and she said she wanted to introduce me to. I said ok and first “date” was just a call. She seemed pleasant and intelligent and we scheduled a coffee date. 

During the coffee date we were making small talk and the topic went to jewelry. I had just gotten a chain for myself and she said she was done ever buying jewelry. I asked why because it’s weird since girls love jewelry and she admitted she sold a diamond ring and got pennies on the dollar which pissed her off and showed her jewelry was overpriced. I asked why she didn’t just keep it and she admitted it was from her ex fiancé who didn’t want it back and she didn’t want to have it around so she sold it to get rid of it. I was surprised she had an ex fiancé and asked about him. She said he was from Australia and always wanted to go back but she told him she didn’t want to leave the US and he accepted that. But he had a family business back there and his sister told her he was putting money in the business and his long trips back home was actually to learn about running it. The she found out he had a one way trip booked after when they had planned to have a wedding and he admitted he thought he could just travel back and forth (this was a export/import business) between the US and Australia and keep the marriage with her that way. I was shocked because that meant his family was probably very rich and she broke up with him just because she didn’t want to deal with a him traveling around part of the year. She got annoyed at my questioning why she would break up over this and said she didn’t want a semi absent father for her future children and her and her family was also decently wealthy and didn’t have any interest in a relationship if she had known this was what he was planning. I told her it showed she wasn’t interested in marriage because she couldn’t put up with a bit of sacrifice and she got mad and told me she had better stuff to do and left. 

My aunt called me and few hours later and was angry because my date had told her mom what I said. I said I was just being honest and she said it was rude and I need to apologize. She also said she would never introduce anyone to me again because her mom said they would rather not associate with a family that raised such a rude man.

I like to buy in bulk to save money, but I also want a flavor that I enjoy ""as is"" from time to time. I have found Chocolate Toffee to be a good base. I enjoy it as is, but it can just as easily become Chocolate (unsweetened cocoa), Peanut Butter (PB2 powder), Chocolate-Peanut Butter or Mocha (iced coffee instead of water). That covers just about all the KC flavors I enjoy while only having to buy one flavor in bulk. My other go to bulk purchase is Banana which I enjoy as is or with cocoa or peanut butter powder.

What is your go to base flavor? I'm guessing many of you start with some type of Vanilla? If so, do you use it as a standalone flavor or solely with mix-ins?

I left but I said come clean otherwise I will, I waited and waited, it's been 2 weeks but he didn't come clean so today I called my sil to come to my place cause I wanted to her something important.

When she came I gave her coffee and made her feel comfortable, in the end I ended up telling her the truth and showed her the photo, she started crying I comforted her and told her I'm sorry I gave my brother 2 weeks but he didn't tell you, I didn't want to hurt you but I think it's the right thing to do, it's better than you know about the betrayal than being oblivious of betrayal and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't tell you.

She hugged me and thanked me and left, but after a few hours my brother called me very angrily and said that I ruined his life, I said you did this to yourself and hung up, my sil later called me and asked me can she stay with me for a while, I agreed cause she also has a son with him and he's only a year and 2 months old 

She came with her bag and son and kept crying, I comforted her and gave her a few drinks, she said she couldn't live with him any longer after knowing what happened and she's filing for divorce, she will live with me for a while if that's okay and later either she will go back to her parents or find a place for herself and I told her she can stay for as long as she wants with how angry my brother is, it probably isn't safe for you

Like an hour ago, my brother called me again and he started cursing me and said that he knows that his wife and child is living with me and kept cursing me and saying that what kinda brother steals his own brother's wife and child and I am a disgrace, my sil heard everything and she said that I didn't do anything, he did it all and she would never go backto him rather live on the streets and hung up and asked me to block

I told her she can sleep in my bed with her son and I'll crash on the living room, she hugged me cried a bit and went to drink in kitchen, I think it's best for now if she stays alone and get over her greif, and I'll keep an eye on her child and her how much she drinks and try to help her as best as I can

- Goodwood: If These Walls Could Talk... | Doug Alderson: ""Spooky Stories From The Swamp"". *Mysterious things happen in swamps. Maybe it's because they are often wet, shadowy places of wild beauty that few people dare to penetrate. They are havens for snakes, alligators, black bears, wildcats, and who knows what else. People on the run have often hidden in swamps, while others have gotten lost in the watery expanses; the swamp can be a refuge or a nightmare. Where else can you find a ghost baby, or an angry specter, or a lost soul? How about a ghost who is obsessed with the ghost orchid, or an alluring snake woman? Author Doug Alderson will tell stories from his Spooky Stories from the Swamp: Tales from the Florida Back Country at the October Lunch & Learn at Goodwood Museum & Gardens.
These are family friendly spine-tingling tales that convey both Florida history and an appreciation for our great swamps.
Doug Alderson is a Florida naturalist and writer who drew upon many years of entertaining young people as a camp counselor and storyteller, and also from decades as a swamp explorer. Who but a naturalist can really scare you about what lurks in the swamp? Doug Alderson has been there and knows. Copies of Alderson's book will be available for sale after the talk. This is a brown-bag luncheon.* Noon

Really hoping someone might have an idea or be able to support. l've a 2 and a half year old Sage Barista Express which very suddenly has dramatically decreased the coffee grounds coming out of the in built grinder.
Almost overnight the quantity of grounds has decreased by about half, requiring a double ""click"" to fill the basket fully.
I've zero clue why..
Steps I've tried so far include,
1. Fully cleaning the hopper, and grinder
2. Adjusting the inner burr
3. 3 different bean types (usual beans I run through it)
4. Adjusting both the grind amount of grounds sizing on the side of the machine.
Video attached is the machine first on 1 (very fine) then 20 (very coarse) I'm not sure if it helps at all. Total output changes, on 1 (very fine) very little coffee - if any - comes through, on 20 much more comes through but still only half a basket.
For context I usually pull 18g double doses around a 7-9 on the grind. Overnight the pull dropped to around 8g and adjusting the dose on the front does little to change it",1,1727970241.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

As you can see, I struggle with quite a bit of hormonal acne. I’ve never had acne before, and 5 years ago I started with an IUD. They warned me that you could get more acne from it. I didn’t really have any issue, a pimple here and there yeah, but what it did give me was the worst cramps of my life. So, almost a year afo, I switched IUD’s. I have a much smaller one now, and my cramps are waaaay better. BUT, my acne has become so bad. I’ve never had this before. My skin is more oily, I used to have dry skin, and it’s just flaring up with pimples the whole time. It gets worse during period time, but in general it looks like this. I’ve been cutting back on sugar, I barely drink milk ( I drink soymilk, but I’ve been cutting back on coffee and so soy milk as well), I started drinking kefir, and a lot of tea. Spearmint is not easily available where I live, I drink mint blends. I also drink hormonal and belly bacteria tea (it’s a nice blend of flowers but I can’t remember which), but I just don’t know if I can do more, or different things. Do I have to eat better? Drink different teas? Or other ones? Are there any other solutions that might help me? I don’t want to make a too big of deal out if it, it’s just pimpels, but it’s becoming worse and I’m starting to struggle with how my self esteem. Even though I know I shouldn’t. It’s really hard sometimes and I wanted to know if I can do anything better for my body and hormones, just in general as well. Thank you",2,1727970212.0,herbalism,1,1.0,False

1fvas2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/aphextwin/comments/1fvas2s/first_saw_8592_review/,First SAW 85-92 Review,"Heliosphan:

Overall the *best* track on 'SAW' in my opinion. Polished and crafted to perfection. The perfect club track, the subtle breaks in the music, those background bells, buzzing hi-hats. That beat dropping in is outrageous every time. But that synth rhythm in the background that carries the track all the way through is what does it for me. There's just so much layering happening with this one. Definitely one of his most digestible tracks in his entire discography and would be enjoyable to a beginner listener. Most will argue Xtal is the Godfather on this album, but I think this track is the true *gem*. 10/10

Tha:

It's melodic, slow-going tempos create a relaxing yet energizing experience. It's a very full-bodied track. Additionally, the background chatter also creates a comforting visual; like I'm in a safe space with loved ones: coffee shop, a nightclub. The background synth reminds me a little of liminal space, which creates a feeling of peculiarity and gives the feeling of being okay with accepting the unknown. 10/10

Xtal:

This track is almost the pure embodiment of nostalgia. This track feels like a warm dream that I don't want to leave. This track feels like a mother's love; security, comfort. It sounds like everything is going to be okay. It's perfect in every way and I wouldn't change a damn thing about it. A true, timeless classic in electronic music. It's honestly hard to find words to describe this song as it really is *that* good. 10/10

Actium:

A fun, playful track but still gets down to business and doesn't take shit from anyone. This is the only track from Afx that I can say reminds me a little of old-school Chemical Brothers (Surrender 1999). 9/10

I:

*Breathtaking* piece of music. I feel as though this is one of his best, most overlooked ambient tracks, even when comparing to ones like #3, and #19. Timeless. 8.5/10

Ptolemy:

Groovy, spacious, fun. There's not too much to hate or say about this track. It's simple, yet effective. 8/10

7th Path:

I always wished this track had a stronger bassline. This track could be almost perfect if the main drop had a louder, more profound bassline. Regardless, banger track and let's be honest here, if any of us heard this in a nightclub we would all lose our fucking minds. 7.5/10

We Are The Music Makers:

And we are the dreamers of the dreams... then casually drop one of the most headbanging rhythms we've ever heard. Truly a classic track on the album and it never gets old no matter how many times I hear it. I love the percussion on this one. Very simple, very digestible, very effective, and *very* fucking good. 7/10

Ageispolis:

I remember hearing 'Ugly Boy' by Die Antwoord and then it brought me back to this track once more. Awesome song. Possibly one of, if not the *best* openings to a track on the album. That poppy synth with that bass drop in the beginning gets me every fucking time. 6.5/10

Hedphelym:

Kind of sounds like Rectum by Thomas Bangalter off the movie Irreversible. Has a headbanger beat but starts to feel droning after a few listens. When I listen to it I feel like I'm in the club tripping on acid while I'm fearing for my entire life. Okay song. Nothing too special. 6/10

Pulsewidth:

Okay. Just okay. Doesn't really do it for me. Has a simple beat that flows throughout the track but I feel like every time I hear it, I expect more that I don't receive. I feel as if it's lacking more of a distinct chorus perhaps. 5.5/10

Green Calx:

This is the only song on the album that frustrates me. I've tried to like this song countless times. It honestly just gives me a headache. There's too much happening. This is unfortunately one of those Afx songs where it goes into the ""It's mainly just noise"" folder, where it sits next to Drukqs tracks. The opener of this track fucking *rips*, though. 3.5/10

Delphium:

This is the worst track on the album for me. Didn't really satisfy me in any way. I feel like this track is oversimplified. It sort of embodies some N64 loading screen game. Maybe Donkey Kong, I'm not sure. The track doesn't really stand out and isn't really memorable in my opinion. 3/10

1fvar4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1fvar4j/21_f4m_a_quest_for_that_connection/,21 [F4M] A quest for that connection,"Dating, especially online, can be frustrating. One moment things are going great, and the next, you get ghosted. It’s discouraging and hurtful, but I’m still a romantic and an optimist. So, why not give it another shot? If we get along, great – we can chat. If not, no harm, no foul. Let’s agree that if things don’t feel right, we’ll be honest and say, “I’m not really feeling it. You’ve been nice, and I wish you luck!” Sound good?

Now that the introduction is out of the way, here’s a bit about me and what I’m looking for.

**What I’m looking for:**

- Someone who genuinely enjoys spending time with me and is interested in getting to know each other.

- Someone who would enjoy sharing details from our days through pics, videos, and voice messages.

- Tall, conventionally handsome or cute, with a slim or average body type.

- Someone who's a student/working with a refined taste in life.

- Single, and no kids.

- Smart and well-educated.

- Someone open to a potential relationship if we connect.

**Who am I?**

- College student

- Smart, well-educated, and well-read.

- Emotionally stable.

- I love music (most genres except metal), books, crafting, reading, watching kdrama, long car rides, badminton, going out with friends, and a nice coffee.

- I have high standards and won’t settle for less than I deserve, knowing what I can provide.

**What I’m not looking for:**

- Someone not over their ex or emotionally unavailable.

- Liars and cheaters.

- DDS or Marcos apologists.

**Some of my flaws:**

- I don't have plenty of time, so if you need it all the time, then you're not for me.

Why Reddit and not dating apps? Because dating apps seems to be filled with the same types of people – “add me on insta,” “citizen of the world,” “traveler,” “sapiosexuals who believe in astrology,” and those “looking for an NSA.”

Finding an SO on Reddit is a long shot, but so was the possibility of the universe existing, and yet here we are. Let’s take it slow, get to know each other, and see where things go. In quantum physics, once two particles share a state, they are no longer separate but exist as one.

So, let’s build each other up, be the best versions of ourselves, let go of the past, live in the present, travel, and be happy.

This is so flawed because in a 2fa system, you ideally reach out to your phone to look for the codes and type them. There is a layer of security that you have to reach out to your phone to login. This is a convenient (except typing 2fa code) part because most of the times the phones with us. 
Ideally I expect the passkey Authorization to go to my phone when I logging into my laptop. This is how Google passkeys work for me. 

(Bitwarden with passkeys) All my accounts have 2fa. So for example, I leave my laptop open and go for a coffee break, and my browser extension is logged in. Anyone can just click login and get into my account. 

(Bitwarden Without passkeys) 
All my accounts have 2fa. So for example, I leave my laptop open and go for a coffee break, and my browser extension is logged in. Anyone can just click login BUT they'll be prompted to enter the 2fa code which is in my phone with me wherever I go, in pocket. Or atleast locked if on my desk. 

This is a hypothetical situation. I don't leave my laptop open. All I am asking is why is the user dumb or didn't take enough care when when passkeys are so poorly implemented? 

All this can be solved my simply prompting the passkey Authorization in my phone wherever I initiate login. This was the whole point of passkeys, just to eliminate typing 2fa codes but still have 2fa by reaching out to your phone. 

Edit0: When Google does passkeys, they send the Authorization to the phone because it's convenient and secure. I know this is a huge undertaking in bitwarden to send authorisation requests to phone but that doesn't negate the fact that  how half baked the idea of that my browser extension should be logged in and type another password in the future BW update to get successful passkey login. It's hilarious. This BW passkey feature makes regular 2fa more appealing.",0,1727969695.0,Bitwarden,4,0.22,False

1fvahic,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fvahic/bad_beans_breville_barista_express/,Bad beans? [Breville Barista Express],"

I recently purchased a Breville Barista Express for my girlfriend. We went to our local coffee roaster shop and asked what they recommend for espresso. We bought a pound of their recommendation, which was a dark roast they called proprietor’s blend.  Yesterday we set up the machine and started brewing. But every time we tried, the machine would not build any pressure and the liquid would come through the portafilter almost immediately, no matter how fine we ground the beans or how hard we tamped them. We set the grind setting so fine that they stopped dispensing altogether. Eventually I suggested we try another bean, and we just poured some old Starbucks beans in the hopper and tried again. Sure enough, the machine built pressure this time and the problem was solved. But does anyone know why this would happen? What about the beans would cause this? 

Also, while troubleshooting, I put the cleaning disc in the portafilter and started a brew just to see if it would build pressure. And it did, but the gauge never went past the middle, even though no water was passing through. Is this normal? I figured it would indicated high pressure.

Thank you for any info or advice, we’re very very new to this world. ",2,1727969326.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1fvagan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1fvagan/husband_i_havent_spoken_in_2_days_help/,Husband & I haven’t spoken in 2 days. Help. ,"

I have a difficult situation here at home and I do not know how to proceed. Kind of a lengthy story, please bear with me.

On Monday night my husband and I were getting intimate when our 2 yr old woke up very abruptly scream-crying. He had an on & off fever that day so it had been a rough day in general. I had to get up from where we were to go settle our kiddo & he ended up taking a bit to relax and fell asleep on top of me, he’s not a small child so I was stuck with his head on my shoulder & body draped over mine.

My husband came into the room and saw our son on me and kind of chuckled, I said “I don’t think I can get out of this soon”. He brought my phone back into the room & put it on the charger next to the bed as I politely asked him to do so. I felt bad but also I am the stay at home parent so night time stuff is my job at this point. I also have to get up in the morning around 6:30 to get my older kiddo up for school, and it was about 11:45 pm at this point.

The crying put me into immediate stress mode, so honestly for me everything else was shut off emotionally and physically. I figured based on the context my husband would not be thrilled but would understand the circumstances of the day / situation. Silly of me to assume. 

The following morning I came out to get my older kiddo going & husband was on the couch with coffee, I went over to give him a hug and he did not reciprocate. In fact, he began demanding an apology for the night prior. Saying that what I did was absolutely the worst he’s ever been treated. I was so caught off guard by his anger that I was in no position to apologize under those circumstances…when in my mind I was going to apologize when I came out but he rushed immediately into that nasty tirade. 

I told him to not bother talking to me, I said that I didn’t actually do anything wrong and him speaking to me that way was no way to resolve the issue. I did not yell, I did not get into it with him. We haven’t spoken since then. There have been little “hey I’m going to the parent teacher conference” but nothing beyond those formalities. 

I asked him if he would like to hug this morning and he spun right back into “I need some acknowledgement…” in the same disrespectful tone & I just said “okay so that’s a no.” Like he’d rather fight first and have me submit than show me that he has a forgiving heart and this is something we can move past together. 

I understand him feeling stood up, but what I cannot understand is the rumination, the anger, the resentment, treating me like I am his enemy. 

What do I do from here? Honestly. I’ve been praying, I’ve been keeping up on household and motherly duties. I’m trying to not create a bigger problem here, but I’m tired of having this blame placed on me like I just up and left on purpose just to hurt him.

If you’ve made it to the end, thank you so much for reading. I did my best to spell it out as it happened, I’m not asking you to take a side…I just need some advice on a possible next step. ",1,1727969243.0,Christianmarriage,11,1.0,False

Recently, after my nanny contract was up in September, I decided to go full in as a postpartum doula instead of finding another nanny position. I completed my training in April through CAPPA & had been working full-time as a nanny and sporadically as a doula.

It wasn't very sustainable as I got burnt out but I was able to gain some experience. I was working as a ppd as a backup for a few agencies so I made a few connections but nothing major. 

Now that I'm out on my own I'm lowkey scared 😅. I'm having difficulty finding any sort of ppd jobs. Luckily, I have an abundance of time right now - no pets, no kids of my own, my boyfriend lives 3 states away, and no full time job. SO I can really jump in headfirst right now.

Currently, I am working on getting my website up. It's through squarespace so pretty easy to put together. I've reached out on Facebook to a few local doulas that I found through doulameet.net. I signed up for a profile there & on Bornbir. I'm having coffee with a doula & a prenatal/postpartum yoga instructor that is running a 2025 new moms group. I have business cards (although I'd like to redo them). 

The next step I think is to meet midwives, OBs and other prenatal/ postpartum professionals but I'm not sure how to do that....

Recently, I went to Tokyo and got to try the Apollon's Gold coffee bar in Kitanomaru. While I first got an iced pourover (a lovely washed Colombian that I also got a bag of), I also tried their espresso of the day which is the Getrudis Sydra from Ecuador.

When I drink an espresso, I usually prefer caramelly/nutty medium roasts as most light roast shots I've tried are too sour for my taste, or in some cases, too much flavor for me to appreciate.

Even though Apollon's Gold roasts quite light, I tried their espresso, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It was really easy to drink, and the tasting notes of mandarin orange and ginger ale were quite clear, almost as clear as a good pourover.

I didn't ask at the time, but it turns out that Apollon's Gold does a 1:3 23-second turbo-style shot at their cafe based on their website.

Since I don't make espresso and I don't often drink single origin espresso, this was the first time for me to try out a turbo-style shot. 

Now I see the appeal of both turbo shots and light roast espresso. I also understand now why so many folks chase that perfect light roast espresso shot. Even though I'll still stick to pourovers, there's nothing quite like that magical shot I got.

Also, I highly recommend checking out Apollon's Gold if ever you're in Tokyo. The barista during my visit was great! He even gave me half a shot of the washed Colombian I tried as he wanted to dial it in for espresso.",2,1727968952.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’ve been experimenting a lot with different brew methods and ratios, and recently I’ve found myself gravitating towards shorter ratios in my pourovers—specifically, a 1:12 ratio in my V60. I use a coarser grind (around 60-65 clicks on my Q2 Heptagonal), 201°F water temp, and multiple pours. What I’ve noticed is this combination gives me a syrupy body and brings out a lot more sweetness than I’ve experienced with longer ratios (like the SCA-standard 1:16).

As I’ve been growing in my ability to taste coffee more intentionally, I’m starting to wonder if my preference for this style is influenced by how coffee is traditionally enjoyed in my home country, the Dominican Republic. Moka pot brews and dark roasted coffee are the norm here, so maybe I’m just more used to those bolder, richer flavors.

I’ve tried longer ratios with different recipes, incorporating more agitation and using other brewers like the Aeropress and Orea. Some of those brews have been decent, but I keep coming back to these shorter, syrupy cups.

I’d love to hear from anyone else who enjoys shorter ratios and coarser grinds for their pourovers. How do you approach your brew recipes? Do you think cultural background or personal experiences with coffee affect your preferences?

I have gotten kosher salt and ordered some specific incense items to cleanse my space with.

Last night while I was laying in bed with my eye mask on I felt my cat brace himself up on the foot of the bed with his two front paws on either side of my foot, which was almost hanging over the edge. I felt the two small impressions in the mattress, and then he began his tentative little sniffs on them. I let him do it, planning on stopping him, but before I could he stopped himself. Then he began kneading the mattress on either side of my foot. Cat people know that cats don’t generally knead something while standing on their back legs. It’s usually when they’re about to lay down and rest. I thought it was weird and went to take off my eye mask and sit up. It stopped. And the cat wasn’t there- he was sleeping in the bathroom. 

This morning I stumbled out of bed and began to make my coffee. I boiled a pot of water and picked it up to move it to the next counter. Something solid and metal clanged loudly to the floor, jolting me fully awake. I even felt the vibrations as it hit the ground. It sounded like a dropped spoon. I put the water back in its place and looked all over the floor. There was nothing there. 

These are new happenings. Since writing that post the other night not only have these instances happened closer together than ever before, but whatever it is is now announcing itself in increasingly unsettling ways. ",2,1727968811.0,Paranormal,2,1.0,False

Two or three times a year if I'm lucky....I find myself in a situation where I realized the full extent of the problem. Slow on the uptake, I know. Since having the realization a year ago, we tried therapy. It brought up ALOT of pain. But nothing really changed. After 6 months, therapy stopped. I now find myself at a point where I'm emotionally withdrawing. It isn't intentional, but I just don't desire her anymore. And now, I'm finding that I don't care.

This morning is an example. She got worked up and upset over something. And I found it very, very difficult to care. I sat there and drank my coffee.  I felt nothing. She noticed and tried to talk about it, still nothing. I don't know how to make myself care. Just like she doesn't know how to get herself to desire sex.

It is very sad. I've grieved immensely over the past year, but I'm on the verge of not caring any more. I'm not sure if that is a good thing, but it seems to be the reality. I say that, and in several weeks, something will happen that care will flare up. But right now, I don't even care enough to fight with her.

I know it is this is terrible. I want to care about her feelings and emotions, but I just can't right now and that isn't something that I must up. This leads me to lack hope that it can ever be restored. ",1,1727968673.0,DeadBedrooms,2,0.67,False

Hoping to get some help and inputs.

(a) Solis Barista Perfetta Plus

(+) Positive points are the manometer, 3 way solenoid valve, an insulated stronger steam wand with manual knob, bigger drip tray, heftier overall build, and higher quality accessories (e.g. tamper) compared to the breville bambinos. 

(-) One of the main negatives are that the Solis dosent have OPV set at 9bar as a default factory setting. Would that be a major issue affecting shots? (Noted Breville all set at 9bar and saw all the gaggia mods highly recommending it.)

I did see the solis OPV could be modded, but probably would not do it out of box for warranty purposes. Additionally Solis as a brand seems to be lesser well known, and likely needs a puck/shower screen to prevent the puck divot from the water jet.

(b) Bambino (-) does not have 3 way solenoid valve, poor accessories (e.g. tamper, portafilter) and will need to upgrade separately adding to cost.

(c) Bambino plus (+) has 3 way solenoid valve, and auto milk steaming, (-) but wand cant oscillate horizontally, only vertically (i do not mind learning how to steam milk)

  
Generally, preference for thermojet/thermoblock for now, for faster startup times and lower beginner price points versus HX or single/double boilers. 

Ginder: Have a DF64 grinder already, currently doing pourover filter coffee.

Drinks: both with and without milk

Location: Singapore, retail prices below

(a) Solis Perfetta USD680 (but there is a promotion dropping to USD 380, which seems like a major positive factor)

(b) Breville Bambino approx USD530

(c) Breville Bambino Plus - not in market yet, coming soon. guessing approx USD 700 same as solis?



Are there other things you would consider? Thanks!

Every morning I turn it on, and make my coffee about 30 minutes later. 90% of the time, no issues. Every few weeks, ill go back to the machine expecting it to be hot and ready to go, only to discover that it is not hot, no steam or boiling water will release, and there is a sizeable pool of water under the machine.

When this happens, ill flip the switch on and then off, and ill notice the pressure gauge quickly rise from zero all the way up. If this happens, I proceed to turn off the machine, wait a few minutes, usually throw some more water in the reservoir... usually that solves my issue and I can use my machine business as usual for the next couple weeks until it happens again.

Im not very handy, but also dont live near a repair shop. Im looking for suggestions on simple things I can try to solve my issue.

Hi everyone.  So the story goes like this. I (28F) am best friend with (28F) let's call her Anna. Anna and I have been friends for more then a decade. But recently I became tired of our relationship. The problem started when I saw instagram post from her, with other girls from our friends group, on a weekend getaway. Having fun and partying. No one told me or called me. And you might be thinking ""you are overreacting "". I thought so too. But then I started thinking. I realized, she never called me to ask me out for a coffee, to come to my place, to go out. I was always the one calling her or them. I called all of them on my birthday party, no one called me back to theirs. When Anna was going thru really bad breakup, loss of a job and more things at the same time, I was there for her every single day. She would cry to me for hours about her situation. I would help her clean her house bcs she was so depressed she couldn't get up. I helped her find a new job, new apartment, start new life. I gave her my car whenever she needed it, I gave her money (she did pay me back), I brought her home cooked meals. Everything bcs I was so sorry to see her in that state . That phase passed and everything was okay, then I got some bad news. My tests came back positive for cervical cancer. I was devastated. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I called her to talk to her about it, she said she's working we will talk when she comes home. She never called me back. I called her again tomorrow,  she said she was tired and forgot about me. We talked, I explained everything, she said she was sorry and that she will help me. She never did. She was always too busy. And I didn't felt mad then bcs I was to occupied with chemo and life itself. I thought she's working a lot, I'm not gonna bother her. Then weeks could go by, she wouldn't even send a text messenge to ask me how am I. I would always  be the one who would reach out to her, and her responses where always short. I stopped sending anything. I focused on getting better. Months went by, and I get a text from her saying ""are you mad at me for something "". To which I reply ""no, I'm not, just very sick, in and out of hospital, having a lot on my mind rn"". After that her response was ""Okey, hope you feel better soon"". That's it. I was in hospital trying to save my uterus and other organs bcs my cancer spread rapidly.  I became so depressed. I got better and got out of the hospital, I just wanted to socialize and talk to someone. I missed people. I called her several times to come by for a coffee or something. She said she was busy working. And then I see the post. She wasn't busy working, she was busy having fun with other people, couldn't come to my house for 2 hours. Just to see if I'm alive. I started crying so hard. I felt like the most lonely person in the world. No one cared for me. And I cared so much for them. I  liked her post and then blocked her. Few days went by and another friend messaged me asking me how am I, and did something happen between Anna and me bcs she is blocked and she can't contact me. I said how I felt, friends response was ""well we just didn't know if you are well enough to travel, and we just wanted you to rest and have some time for yourself. It's not okay your acting this way to her, she's hurt"".
I felt so mad. I started crying again and I blocked them all. I don't know what to think anymore. I feel so bad and lonely.

So I got the P yesterday. It kinda looks weird in my opinion hahaha. Does it look cut off like that in your score reports, too? I am a **European non-US IMG** btw

**Materials**  
UWorld  
Mehlman Arrows pdf  
NBME 26-31  
NBME new free 120  
some youtube videos  
a little bit of Anking (explained below)



**Timeline** (Exam date Sep 19th)

Our medical school follows a structure common in several European countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, where education is divided into three phases. The first phase, lasting two years, focuses on preclinical knowledge. The second phase is three years long and emphasizes clinical knowledge and skills, while the third phase consists of a year of clinical rotations. After completing each of these phases, we take a major exam, similar to the USMLE 3-step system. However, there are significant differences in the content. For example, our preclinical phase does not cover many diseases, and subjects like pharmacology and microbiology are introduced after this phase. Due to this difference, I decided to take the USMLE Step 1 a year after completing my preclinical phase. I used my summer break after the first year of the clinical phase (three years into medical school) to prepare for Step 1.

I started studying on July 1st with my baseline NBME 26 (got 49% EPC). After that, I started to study with **UWorld only**. I would make 40 Question blocks of one system and just start answering them untimed. After each question, I read the explanations until I fully understood the right answer, then added key points and images to my UWorld-notebook, organized by systems and diseases. I didn’t necessarily read every word, as some suggest, but focused more on understanding the topics.

In the beginning, I started to use the Anking deck. I would mark questions in UWorld and then copy the IDs of the questions into anki with an addon to filter out the anki cards about them and study them. This system was working well actually but I coudn't maintain it because of the time it would take to finish the cards every day. So I stopped doing that after a couple of weeks.

I took my second NBME 27 on July the 15th (got 57% EPC) but did not change my strategy after that. But I had a 4-week mandatory rotation after that so more than half my day was used up on that in that period. I tried studying after I got home which didn't work that good but I took what I got.

After that internship ended on August the 9th, I didn't have many appointments so I could focus more on the exam. I calculated that I needed to do about **80-90 questions per day** to finish UWorld if I didn't take any rest days (which I ended up taking of course) with about two weeks of buffer. I didn't do any other NBME for some time and instead focused on finishing UWorld. I would wake up in the morning and do as many questions as I could and then I would watch some show in the evening to clear my mind. That helped a lot actually (I watched Fullmetal Alchemist - Brotherhood if you're interested hahah). I also took rest days if I really really didn't have any motivation to study that day but tried to keep it low to not use up my buffer.

So after finishing system after system on Uworld, I took my third NBME 28 on August the 30th (69% EPC). That helped me relax a bit. But it could also have been a mistake because my scores stagnated after that. Maybe it was a little bit too early to feel safe.

I ended up not finishing UWorld. There were 430 Unused, 80 in Biostatistics, 139 in psych, 24 miscellanous and 187 gastrointesinal. So I finished 88% of Uworld with 55% being correct. I did not do a second pass.

Instead of finishing UWorld, I did some anki cards on lab values, watched FA Rapid Review on Youtube and read Mehlman's Arrows pdf. This pdf really was a game changer.



**Self-assessements**

**NBME 26**: 49% EPC - 51% raw (80 days prior to exam)  
**NBME 27**: 55% EPC - 57% raw (65 days prior)  
**NBME 28**: 69% EPC - 71% raw (19 days pior)  
**UWSA 1**: 59% - 213 (14 days prior)  
**NBME 29**: 66% EPC - 67% raw (13 days prior)  
**UWSA 2**: 61% - 209 (12 days prior)  
**NBME 30**: **57% EPC** - 60% raw (8 days prior) - yikes  
**NBME 31**: 71% EPC - 71% raw (7 days prior)  
**new free 120:** **58%** (4 days prior) - this one hurts the most haha

I didn't do the old free 120 after that because I wanted to use my time differently. NBME 30 and the new free 120 did worry me especially because everyone was saying that the new free 120 was the most predictive. But I decided to not postpone my exam.



**Test day**

I had to travel to another European country to take my exam. I traveled by train the day before my step 1. I finished reading Mehlman's Arrows on the way but decided to not do anything else for the exam after that. I just went to my accommodation bought some things food and wet toilet paper and read some tipps on this reddit thread and watched the nbme tutorial online. But I did not read upon any study materials anymore.

I brought everything in a small plastic bag that fit inside the test center’s locker. There also were bigger lockers for bags but they could not be locked. I also don't know if every location has this option.  I took:

* ID!!!!
* Scheduling permit!!!
* 3 protein bars (finished 2)
* 1 large cold coffee from the supermarket (it was sugar free and high protein)
* 2 cans of energy drink (didn't even open them in the end)
* 2 large bottles of water without label (3 litres overall - took one with me inside and left the other one outside - drank nearly everything as I like drinking a lot while studying - I believe it elevates the blood pressure a little bit)
* some tissues
* wet toilet paper
* some pain medications (didn't use any at all but just in case)

**break time (!)**: I would recommend looking up the online tutorial because it is nearly identical to the tutorial on the test day. Then you can click through it and finish it in 10 seconds. That's 15 minutes of extra break time right there which allows you to have 60 minutes of break time overall. I would recommend doing a break after every block. I actually didn't do that consistently. After the second block, I only did a 30 seconds break and continued, but was a little bit slow at the end of the third block. So I believe this was a small mistake. After each other block, I took a break and went to the bathroom even if I didn't feel like going (as I wrote above, I drank very much water). I would also take at least a bite off the protein bar in the break.



**Post exam thoughts**

I would definietly do some thiings differently if I travelled through time again to July 1st. I would also study with UWorld but I believe the Mehlman pdfs are a very good addition to that (I only used arrows, but it was very very helpful). I would try to at least watch the Pathoma videos (at least the basics). I would definitely try to start studying earlier, too. Just some thoughts

I've tried to research this dollhouse and my best guess is it was ordered out of a Sears catalogue, though I'm unsure as to the year. My mother received it when she was a ""little girl."" It's made out of that cardboard/press board and it could be in better shape.  I don't even know how ""collectible"" it really is, especially in its current state. Does anyone have any info about it? Know where I could send it to be part of a collection, maybe?

Ideally, I would love to send this to someone who will cherish it or maybe add it to their collection? Right now, it languishes away in a box. This is **NOT** a ""for sale"" post. I would LOVE to send this to someone who wants it around for more of a reason than ""it was my mothers."" I reached out awhile ago to [Florine ](https://my-vintage-dollhouses.blogspot.com/)but it sounded like she didn't have room for it.

All the accoutrements are items my mother added to it when she had it. I'm happy to answer any questions - or potentially call my mother to ask, if anyone is curious.

I recently tried the WHOOP strap for almost two months, and while there are things I liked, I ultimately decided it wasn’t for me. Here’s why:

What I Liked:

	•	Discreet Design: I enjoy wearing a regular watch for a more formal look at work, and WHOOP allowed me to do that while still tracking my health data. It’s a subtle accessory that blends well.
	•	24/7 Wearability: I loved not having to take it off, even for charging. The external charger is a neat idea that allows you to charge without removing the strap.
	•	Comfort: It’s super comfortable for sleep and daily wear. I never had to think about switching between a watch and a fitness tracker.

The Downsides:

	•	The Price: Here’s the main issue—after two years of using WHOOP, you’d end up paying around €550. At that price point, you could easily buy a new smartwatch every year or two. And while WHOOP provides health insights, it’s not a smartwatch. It’s essentially an accessory that sticks with you, but the value for money just isn’t there, especially considering what you get in return.
	•	Insights Aren’t Groundbreaking: WHOOP offers insights on sleep and recovery, but honestly, nothing blew my mind. It told me things I already knew—like how alcohol affects my sleep or that I sleep better in my own bed. For the average person who isn’t a high-performance athlete, these insights don’t seem worth the cost.
	•	The Daily Journal: The daily questionnaire started to feel like a chore. Every day, I had to remember things like how many coffees I had or when I had my last meal. And let’s be honest, by the next day, I don’t always remember those details accurately. I think WHOOP would be more effective if it allowed you to log things throughout the day instead of asking you to recall everything the following morning.

Final Thoughts:

WHOOP’s concept is solid, and I see it being useful for athletes, personal trainers, or anyone whose lifestyle revolves around optimizing their performance. But for the average user, the high cost doesn’t seem justified. The insights didn’t add enough value to warrant the steep monthly or yearly fee. Eventually, I found myself losing interest, skipping the daily logs, and feeling like the product wasn’t giving me much in return.

So, while WHOOP might work for some, I personally didn’t find it worth the investment.",2,1727968190.0,whoop,2,0.57,False

I kept everything in the freezer and I found the quality preserved pretty well for the most part but after the 2 month mark it started to decay a bit more.



Recipe was pretty consistent: 


-grind size 6 on Ode 2 (up or down grind size depending on what I was after) 

-93 degrees on stagg kettle 

-v60 plastic dripper, hario filters 

-2x weight in bloom, then the remaining water divided by two equal pours (2nd pour circular, 3rd pour more centered)



My top three favourites in no particular order:
-ombligon by Nestor lasso, super fruity , blueberries, cherries, strawberries, really pops and tastes great in pour over and espresso



-coco, this coffee was very unique and tasted like coconut cookies, it was good in pour over and really shined when I made a cortado



-the cosecha especial at the bottom- I frequently talk with the producer of this coffee and it's a caturra natural. Very well rounded coffee that is more caramel and nuttier, if I could only have one everyday I'd choose this one.



All I can say is wow! The variety and differences between coffees blew my mind (& my friends who normally drink Folgers and the like). So lucky to have access and buy and support directly from these amazing producers!

I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. Tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too. However, I'm also good at being a coach potato on a weekend if it's needed.

I love all kinds of music. Mainly older things like Beatles, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, I could go on and on. I'm definitely a bit of an old soul. 70s and 80s rock, 90s stuff and of course good old emo music from the 2000s

I use to do a lot of comedy in the city. Would write my own sketch shows and produce/be in them. Some of the best times of my life. I'm currently working on a short horror movie script to hopefully film and enter in film fest next year. I'm a creative guy. Guarantee l'd find us the best dates.

I'm looking for my other half at this point. Someone who can push me to be the best version of myself, and someone I can do the same for. Someone who I can laugh with, take trips with and just enjoy the little things.

1fv9wk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1fv9wk0/39f_healthy_ischemic_stroke_positive_story/,"39F healthy - ischemic stroke, positive story :) ","I’m writing this to the other people like me who had a stroke out of no where with low risk factors. I’m 39, I exercise regularly (jogging 45 mins around my hilly neighborhood 3x a week + 2-3 days good weight lifting), 1-2 cups of coffee a day, 1-3 drinks a week, high protein high fiber diet. 

Risk factors: I’m was on estrogen and I travel long distances for work and I have a larger than normal PFO. 

Stroke occurred during sex 🙈 It was absolutely terrifying and my doctors said that my biggest post stroke issue will be PTSD. 

I made it to the hospital within 45 minutes, and they found a very small clot (1-3mm - the cardiac doctor couldn’t remember off hand bc he just noted it was consistent with PFO explanation)

I was treated with plavix and aspirin. I scored a 1 on the stroke scale at an hour after the event. If they hadn’t done an MRI it wouldn’t have been seen, CT was clear except for a small, nearly insignificant delay to left occipital lobe. I’m glad the hospital was diligent. 

This happened in NYC, and my EMT’s thought it was nothing but still took me to NYU Langone :) 

Anyway, here I am, in a hotel on Park Ave where I will rest for a few days. I decided to stay for the PFO closure before I fly home to California. I am, of course, terrified in some ways but I’ve learned a significant number of women have estrogen related strokes. I was to reassure younger stroke victims that things are ok, you aren’t a total freak 😂 

I read all these very intense Google searches that relate to patients coming from a very different baseline and a very different circumstance. There isn’t a lot about these sorts of small strokes in younger people from clear(er) causes.

I do have some leg weakness and a bit of a limp at 2 days out but I think I came out very lucky. I want to extend a hand to anyone who comes across this and has had similar situations to reach out. I’m a catastrophic thinker and I believe the PTSD really will be the hardest thing to overcome. My best friend is a therapist who says “the opposite of depression is community!”

1fv9wcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1fv9wcn/how_do_i_handle_a_fallout_with_a_friend/,How do I handle a fallout with a friend?,"Hey all - writing this mostly to help wrap my own mind around it but would appreciate any words of insight or encouragement.

Tldr: had a close female friend/roommate and when I broke up with our other mutual friend, she got really hostile, didn't listen my side of story, shit talked me to another friend which caused that friend to write me off and then essentially kicked me out. Why do things like this happen?

I (24F) had a work friend (also 24F), we'll call her Shannon. Most of what she talked about was negative - critiques of people at her other job, our job, her boyfriend and boyfriend's family. She said she has always struggled to have female friendships because it's ""too much drama"". Initially I thought the negativity was deserved as I had no reason not to trust her.

I started seeing a guy we both worked with (it's a small business so everyone knows each other well and they also hung out outside of work). It was very casual and we agreed to be non-exclusive. I ended up telling her because she knew him and I wanted to get her opinion on a few problems I was having with him. I was simultaneously seeing someone else which was all she focused on. She didn't help me talk through the problems I was having with our mutual friend, just told me the right thing to do was choose between the 2 guys (even though I had only gone on 1 date with the second). She said things like ""if you hurt my boy..."" and didn't care when I said ""he hurt me by doing x, y, z"". I ended up deciding to end things with our work friend due to incompatibility and I divulged to her that I was anxious about hurting his feelings and scared to pull the plug. She responded angrily and told me she didn't like the way I handled things and I needed to leave her out of any future relationship discussions. My current roommate/best friend was one of the only people who saw us interact in a romantic way and helped me gain some perspective that he didn't treat me the way I deserved and the relationship had been difficult for me from the start but it was still hard to hear Shannon's critique.

This next part may confuse some of you as honestly I should have stepped back from the relationship then but I ended up moving in with Shannon and her bf while I was in between leases. I was nervous about it but since she had offered unprompted, I thought she wanted me there and that it would be okay. It was not. I am indisputably a great roommate. I leave common areas cleaner than I found them, ask before I use things (even though they both said constantly I could use/eat whatever I liked), help care for my roommate's pets, and in this case paid way more than my fair share of utilities, replaced any common food items we all used and Venmoed her bf money for things I used. Despite this, her bf spoke to me very disrespectfully, ie, ""move your socks out of the foyer"" (the socks were onto of my shoes on the shoe wrack - idek how he saw them). ""It's you who's breaking the f'ing trashcan"" when he saw me open it manually (turned out the batteries were just low) and was generally just very critical, cursed a lot, and never said please for anything. One time she was out of town and they didn't tell me she was coming home late so I'd parked my car in her spot. He yelled my name through the house to move my car which I didn't mind doing at all but yelling at 10pm was unneccesary. She was out of the house a lot with friends and my work schedule made it so we didn't see each other very much. When I would tell her about weekend plans, sometimes she would say things like ""we never go on coffee dates anymore"" even though we did. I am a good deal more introverted than she is so perhaps there was a feeling that I didn't want to spend time with her when I just didn't feel I needed to make plans outside of the house when we already saw each other a lot at home.

We had another friend named Leah who I was close with. I organized a graduation present for her and took her shifts when she needed it.

I told Shannon I was moving out (which was the plan all along once I'd figured out a new place to live) and that was when things started getting rough. I asked her if I should tell Leah about my old relationship and Shannon said no 'it will change how she sees you guys"" so I didn't. Later that night she ended up telling her herself. We were all planning to hang out and when I asked to confirm, they didnt respond. I called my ex because he has been with them. He explained Shannon had told Leah about us and neither of them ""agreed with how I handled things"" and Leah felt I'd been blowing her off even though she was the one who had had a super busy summer taking classes, working full time, and traveling. When Shannon's bf got home from a trip, the garbage disposal was making a weird noise and they blamed it on me. Even if it was me, I didn't do it intentionally and the landlord came and fixed it but she told me to just go ahead and get my stuff, leave my key, and don't talk to her bf at all because he was ""absolutely livid"" about me breaking the sink.

For context, she was also pretty rude to him and would call him fat, an idiot, and he seemed to be pretty preoccupied by keeping her happy which included keeping the house pristine and up to her standards. One time it was just him and me home while she was out of town and he asked me to keep a secret that he was having a friend over and not to tell Shannon bc she didn't like this friend. 

I am very sensitive and I took this all very seriously. I felt terrible that maybe my ex had been holding back how I'd made him really feel even though we'd had several heart-to-heart conversations about how much we liked each other and that I respected him, our communication styles just weren't the same and I couldn't continue.  I was frustrated because I had tried to explain this to Shannon several times after asking her consent to discuss romantic relationships. She didn't listen so I imagine the story she told Leah was one sided. I texted Leah to apologize for not telling her myself and explained that I didn't because I had not wanted to change any of her relationships with any us for the worst. I also apologized if she felt I hadn't put in enough effort. She responded with only a short text saying she hopes I find the support I need when I move (I'm moving states so pretty far and won't see them as often). I was very taken aback and she is known as one of the sweetest people in our friend group and has always been extremely aware of my feelings and accommodating. All of this was hard and confusing as I had been a pretty important person in their lives from advice about graduate school, sharing resources, paying for coffee, pet sitting for basically free, listening to their problems, etc. For more content, I remember we went dress shopping with Shannon at 10pm when she was having a bad body image day after which she said sincerely ""you are a good friend"". My ex said not to take it personally, he's seen her be very hot and cold with people but it's still hard hear. She texted me yesterday just saying ""so wtf did I do you"". At this point I didn't see how I could still be friends with any of them because they literally made my heart race when I texted them worrying I did something else wrong so I explained how I'd reflected a lot and think that our relationship is unhealthy and I couldn't continue to be friends with someone who made me feel so badly. Of course I thanked her for her hospitality and wished her the best. She responded ""that's actually perfectly fine with me. You were really disrespectful when you were living here and I didn't think we would remain friends after this.""

I guess I just want to know, why are people like this? I tried my best to be good to her but it was never enough and she seemed to have written me off for breaking up with our mutual friend.",1,1727967853.0,internetparents,1,1.0,False

I'm currently in the process of losing weight and have realized that I'm not consuming enough protein. Since I love frappuccinos and ice cream, I figured this might be a good way to cut down on sweets while replacing them with something healthier and higher in protein.

I'm considering buying a Ninja Creami but can't decide between the regular and the deluxe model. The deluxe has built-in drink settings, which sound useful, but I'm wondering if the difference is really worth the extra money.

Also, I'm not entirely sure how it works. I understand that I need to freeze the ingredients beforehand, but if I freeze coffee with protein powder and then add milk, will it work? Or do I have to freeze it with something like Skinny Syrup? I'm not a big fan of overly sweet drinks, and I already use lactose-free milk, which is a bit sweet on its own. I’d also love to try something like matcha with honey and milk – would that hold up in the machine too?

Let’s explore the key benefits of applying for this exciting visa.

# Work from an Inspiring Environment

When you hold a digital nomad visa in Spain, you can work in picturesque locations. Whether it's the sunny beaches of Costa del Sol, the artistic vibes of Barcelona, or the historic streets of Madrid, your work environment becomes more than just a desk—it’s a lifestyle. Imagine finishing your project while enjoying a coffee in a bustling café or watching the sunset from your balcony. This change in scenery can boost your creativity and productivity.

Networking is vital for anyone working remotely. Spain's growing community of digital nomads means you can easily connect with like-minded individuals and professionals in your field. Participate in co-working spaces, tech meetups, and networking events, all designed to help you form connections that can benefit your career. You’ll find inspiration and collaboration opportunities that can take your work to the next level.

# Financial Requirements and Tax Implications of Living in Spain as a Digital Nomad

Living as a digital nomad in Spain comes with incredible opportunities, but it also requires careful financial planning. Understanding the financial requirements and tax implications is crucial before making the move. This guide will help you navigate through important financial aspects to ensure a smooth transition to your new life in Spain.

# Cost of Living in Spain

The cost of living in Spain varies based on the city and lifestyle you choose. Major cities like Madrid and Barcelona tend to be more expensive, while smaller towns offer a more affordable way of life. Here are some key points to consider:

* **Housing:** Rent is typically your largest monthly expense. In major cities, expect to pay between €800-€1,500 for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center.
* **Utilities:** On average, basic utility costs (electricity, heating, cooling, water, and garbage) can range from €100-€200 per month.
* **Groceries:** Budget around €200-€350 per month for groceries, depending on dietary preferences.
* **Transportation:** Public transport is affordable; a monthly pass in cities averages €40.

# Financial Requirements for Digital Nomads

To qualify for a digital nomad visa, having a steady income and meeting financial criteria is essential. Spain typically requires proof of income and savings to support your living expenses. Here’s what you generally need:

* **Minimum Income:** You should demonstrate a monthly income of at least €2,000-€3,000, depending on the circumstances.
* **Savings:** Offering evidence of sufficient savings (around €10,000 or more) can be beneficial, as this shows you can support yourself as a digital nomad.
* **Health Insurance:** You need to have private health insurance that covers you in Spain, which may cost you around €50-€200 per month.

# Tax Implications

Moving to Spain also involves understanding the tax obligations that come with living there. As a digital nomad, being informed about taxes in Spain is essential:

* **Residency Status:** If you stay in Spain for more than 183 days in a tax year, you will likely be considered a tax resident, subject to Spanish income tax on worldwide income.
* **Income Tax Rates:** Spain has progressive tax rates that range from 19% to 47%, based on your total annual income. It’s advisable to consult a tax professional to clarify your tax liabilities.
* **Double Taxation Agreements:** Spain has various agreements with countries to avoid double taxation, so check if your home country has a treaty with Spain, which might reduce your tax responsibilities.

# Banking and Currency Considerations

Managing your finances is easier if you open a bank account in Spain. Most banks require a proof of residence, identification, and sometimes an initial deposit. Using a local bank can help avoid international fees and simplify transactions.

# Currency Exchange

Spain uses the Euro (€). Understanding the current exchange rate and evaluating your foreign transaction fees is important in the transition phase. Tools like online currency converters can assist you in keeping track of your finances.

# Emergency Fund

Having an emergency fund is advisable when relocating to Spain. Aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses to cover unforeseen circumstances such as medical emergencies, unexpected travel, or other necessary expenses.

# Final Tips for Financial Success

* **Budget Wisely:** Create a budget that includes all your regular expenses and stick to it.
* **Monitor Currency Fluctuations:** Keep an eye on exchange rates, which can affect your expenses and income as a digital nomad.
* **Consult Local Experts:** Don’t hesitate to seek advice from local financial advisors or expatriates already living in Spain to better understand your financial landscape.

By planning your finances and understanding the costs and obligations of living in Spain, you can enjoy your digital nomad lifestyle with confidence and comfort. Embrace the adventure that awaits you while staying secure in your financial decisions!

It's been several years since I took a Carter Center training for election observers, and I was hoping to find those materials again, but unfortunately they're no longer available online. Fortunately Wisconsin does publish some good guidance, and I've provided links to some of the materials below. 

Anyone can be an election observer. As a non-partisan election observer, your role is to ensure transparency and integrity in the election process. Here are few key guidelines to follow:  
  
**1. Notify Upon Arrival**

* If it's your local polling place and you are voting, vote before you start the observer process. 
* Ask to speak to the Chief Inspector. They're busy. Be patient and kind to everyone involved. It's a tough job, and a long day. 
* Inform the Chief Inspector that you would like to register and serve as an observer.
   * Record their name and the time you registered. 

* You will be asked to sign the observer log and provide photo identification. You must wear an ""Election Observer"" badge while in the polling place. 
* You are not required to state an organizational affiliation. That said, I have experienced Election Inspectors that insist on it because there's a blank on the form. At that point I have said “The Carter Center”, or made up an organization \[Last name\] Family Center for Democracy. 

**2. Follow Observation Area Rules**

* You will be placed in a designated observation area. This area must be between 3 to 8 feet from the tables where voters check-in and register.

* You should be able to see and hear the voting process, but not interfere with the flow of voters.
* Don't eat in the observation area. Generally, the election inspector won't mind if you have a coffee or bottle of water. 

**3. Respect the Voting Process**

* Do not speak to voters, and avoid disrupting the election inspectors. 
* Keep conversation and activity to a minimum.

* Refrain from using cell phones for calls or photography inside the polling place. 
* Silent texting is allowed, but discouraged because it can be difficult to distinguish from audio and video recording. 

**4. Record Observations and Report Issues Appropriately**

* Bring a notepad and writing utensils. Do not use audio recording or any form of camera. 
* Observe and record the consistency with which election clerks confirm registrations, verify eligibility, and maintain the poll logs.  
* Observe and record the consistency with which election clerks respect and safeguard voter privacy.
* Observe and record how elections officials provide ballot access, support, and resources for persons with special needs.
* Observe and record how elections officials address unusual behavior of others in or near the polling place.
   * Examples include intimidation, cameras or audio recording in or outside the polling place, attempts to directly observe the qualification, registration, or eligibility verification of other voters for the purpose of influencing or intimidating or dissuading voters, attempts to directly observe the completion or submission of ballots, and or promoting candidates, parties, policies, or ballot initiatives. 
      * Some of these activities can be allowable, after all, you're there as an observer. Use good judgement. 
   * Patriotism is not electioneering. If someone comes in red white and blue from head to toe, just be happy they're wearing clothes and are having a good day. 
* Direct any questions or concerns to the chief inspector immediately, but in a manner that does not disrupt their responsibilities.
* If you believe a voter is ineligible, you may bring it to the attention of the chief inspector, but as an observer you do not directly challenge voters. 
* If you believe an eligible voter is being wrongfully denied the ability to cast their ballot, you may bring it to the attention of the chief inspector.

**5. Election Observers may not:**

* Engage in electioneering
* Video and still cameras are not allowed
* Handle official election documents
* Have conversations about candidates, parties, referenda, or ballot questions
* Make calls / use cell phones for voice calls inside the polling area (texting or other silent usage is acceptable if it is not disruptive)
* Wear clothing or buttons related to candidates, parties or referenda that is intended to influence the election
* Interact with voters, except when requested.
* View confidential information on the poll list.
* Enter vehicles of curbside voters.

**6. In the Event That a Voter’s Eligibility Is Challenged**

* Anyone can challenge the right of someone else to cast a ballot if they sincerely believe that the person does not meet the rules to vote on the basis that: they aren’t a U.S. citizen, not at least 18 years old, haven't lived in the polling area for at least 10 days, have a felony and haven’t gotten their rights back, have been judged unable to vote, or if they already voted in this election.
* As an observer, you may ask the inspector for and record the name of the individual issuing the challenge. If the challenge is for the wrong reasons, the person making the challenge can face civil penalties.
* The inspector shall then ask only those of the following questions which are appropriate to test the person's qualifications based on the cause for the challenge:
   * (a) Are you a United States citizen?
   * (b) Are you at least 18 years of age?
   * (c) For at least the 10 days before this election, have you resided in, or been a resident of, the ward or election district from which you seek to vote?
   * (d) Are you currently disqualified from voting for any of the following reasons:
      * A felony conviction for which you are still serving probation or are on parole or extended supervision?
      * A judge's ruling that you are incapable of voting?
      * Having made a bet or wager on this election?
      * Having voted previously in this election?
   * If someone is challenged, they are required to answer the questions about their qualifications, and if they refuse to take an oath affirming their responses or to answer the questions, they won’t get a ballot. However, if they meet all the rules after answering the questions and taking an oath, they should be allowed to vote.

* The inspector should conduct the verification interview away from other voters whenever possible. 
* Record everything you observe. 

  
**7. Remain Neutral**

* Do not wear anything supporting a candidate, political party, or ballot issue.

* Your role is to observe and document the process impartially, not to influence or promote any side.  

**8. You do not have to register as an election observer to observe, report, and record unusual practices and behavior at the polls.** 

* You may ask for the Inspector and report any concerns you have. 
* Record everything you observe and report. 

By following these guidelines, you can help promote a fair and transparent election process in Wisconsin.

As most of the threads on Japan hotels are by couples or solo travelers, I thought I’d throw in my two cents about these properties from the perspective of a family traveling with a young kid. This is our fourth visit to Japan, but first with a chid.

Happy to answer any questions while the memories are still fresh. 

**Four Seasons Otemachi**

We started and ended our trip with a pair of three-night stays here. 

Stayed in a Panaramic Suite (thanks to u/sarahwlee for hooking up the upgrade and everything else related to planning/booking this trip). In-suite check-in after a 14 hour flight was a welcome relief. Beautiful suite with, you guessed it, panoramic views of the city. Sofa bed in the living room for the kiddo that was put away during daily housekeeping and set up each night at turndown. The living area has its own full bathroom with shower.

The pool was one of the big draws for us here. Unlike some other Tokyo hotels (e.g. Pen and Bulgari), there are no set hours where kids are allowed in the pool; you can go anytime the pool is open (6:30a-9:30p), which is very helpful when jet lag hits. 

As usual with FS, lots of kids amenities provided: kid-friendly welcome amenity that included a bucket of Japanese snacks, kids-sized pajamas/bathrobe/slippers/pool sandals, and a stuffed Shiba Inu. 

This isn’t one of those “everyone knows your name and what you’re up to” hotels, it’s very decidedly a city hotel that caters to many business travelers as well as families, but the staff were as helpful as we needed them to be. FS chat in the app is amazing and I used it for almost everything both before the stay and during. Everything from food orders to requesting turndown to asking for local recs to coordinating having them pick something up from a store for us, handled promptly and correctly. 

The hotel also handled luggage forwarding for us. They fill out all of the paperwork, get your bags to the shipping company, and charge to your room. This was a big help as well.

Gym is excellent with a wide variety of equipment and weights. Only negative is no true rack/barbell, smith machine only.

As another “kill 30 jet lagged minutes while we acclimate” activity, our son did the FS Kids Academy at Pigneto, the Italian restaurant. They had him make a pizza, complete with very cute chefs outfit. He had fun, though you could tell the restaurant was pretty busy. 

Room service breakfast was excellent, the best of our trip by far. Our son loved the eggs, breakfast sausages, and shokupan french toast. Dinner options were solid as well; nothing to write home about but does the trick when you’re tired. One thing I wish we’d discovered before our last day: the attached office building (Otemachi One), has a very impressive looking food court. There’s also a 7-11 there for quick snacks, though sadly this one is without the DIY smoothie machine.

The concierge also booked us an awesome insider’s tour of Toyosu market where we got to go into the wholesale area, handle some crabs, get a close up look at the fish, and barely avoid getting pancaked by fish carts.

The location is in a bit of a no-man’s land, though in Tokyo that doesn’t matter all that much, as you’re right on top of Otemachi station so getting anywhere is easy. Tokyo Subway is incredibly easy, just load a Suica or Paso onto your mobile wallet before you go and you can breeze through the city (kids 6 or under ride free). The one advantage the location has, if you’re into coffee, is that Glitch’s far superior Jimbocho location is a short \~10 minute walk away, and they have delicious apple juice as a kids option.

This is one of those “no locks on the bathroom doors” hotels, which is a minor pet peeve of mine.

One location tip: the correct closest exit from Otemachi station for this hotel is C2a. The other C2 options take you across the street, and even the exit the concierge recommends for some reason (C4) is farther from the front door. 

Would happily stay here again as a family.

**Four Seasons Kyoto**

Three nights here in a Heritage Garden Residence (this was a multi-category FSPP upgrade from the suite we booked). I could wax poetic about the decor or the view of the hotel’s 800 year-old pond, but by far the highlight of this room was a washer/dryer. I don’t care how many thousands of dollars I’m spending on a hotel stay, I’m not paying $7 to wash my kid’s socks, so this thing was basically running full-speed for our entire stay. The staff provided detergent. Just like FSO, the living area had a full bathroom with shower. 

No pajamas at this one, but they did have kids-sized robes and slippers. 

Breakfast options were simpler than Tokyo, though not worse.

They have a kids playroom near the gym which was **awesome** for killing time while parents relaxed or used the gym (kids have to be supervised in the play room but we switched off). It’s a small room but has a little slide/monkey bar thing, a bunch of books, brio train set, mini kitchen, etc. They also have fish food at the front desk that you can feed the koi in the garden pond with. 

While we were there, they had live entertainment in the lobby each night, usually musicians though one night was a maiko dance that was really neat. 

The bathroom doors lock here.

Similarly good gym to Otemachi (albeit with a basement “view” rather than a 39th floor view of Tokyo).

I know I said FS Otemachi was in no-man’s land, but the location is a real negative for this hotel (and the Six Senses nearby). You’re on a big hill and getting in a cab to get practically anywhere. 

Unrelated to the hotel, but we did find an excellent tour guide (on our own) who did a great custom tour for us and made it fun for the kiddo. Not sure if he’s alright with me mentioning him here but feel free to DM and I’ll share his info.

I’d stay again, but TBH preferred both the location (by a healthy margin), the hard product (by a hair), and the Pierre Hermes pastries (by an ispahan croissant) of the RC where we stayed on our last trip. The price was 1.5x higher than the FS for this trip given FS’ third night free offer, so I still feel like we got good value for our choice.  


**Gora Kadan Hakone**

Of the hotels on this trip, this would likely be the most divisive property on this forum. It is also our only return stay; we were last here \~11 years ago. The dinner menu from that visit sits in a frame on my office wall, which is to say we’ve long looked back on that trip fondly. 

Hakone doesn’t have many great hotel options, and at the higher end it’s really this or the Hyatt Regency. We wanted to get a ryokan experience into this trip, so Gora Kadan it was.

GK is **extremely** different from the western-style hotels discussed in this review. It is a true Japanese ryokan, which means breakfast and dinner are included (and huge, more on that in a bit), things happen according to a schedule (you select your breakfast and dinner times and menus in advance), gym is by appointment, and while there are English speakers on staff, there will be some interactions with a language barrier. Luckily Google Translate/ChatGPT make this extremely easy to overcome. (FWIW I used ChatGPT as a translator several times on this trip and it worked like magic.) 

We stayed in the Meigetsu Suite. It’s not a true suite, e.g. there’s no door separating a second living area, just a curtain separating a corner with a small desk and vanity mirror, so this was the tightest quarters of our trip. The setup is two twin beds, and they put a futon mattress on the floor for our son after we requested it. One shared bathroom. The highlight of the room is the private outdoor onsen, which the whole family loved and it got a lot of use during our two nights here. They also have shared onsens separated by gender, but we didn’t use them on account of the private one in the suite.

This suite is also located in its own separate annex, which is nice as we weren’t worried about our son bothering other guests when he ran around the room.

When you check in, they ask you what time you want dinner, which is a kaiseki meal, as well as breakfast (and whether you want the Japanese or western option for the latter). If you’re staying longer than one night, they give you the option to choose an alternate meal (kaiseki with wagyu, shabu shabu, or sukiyaki) for your second night. 

The biggest downside of this hotel for us, at the risk of winning Olympic gold in First World Problems, is that the volume of food you get is insane. Probably 3,000-5,000 calories per meal, and while we did our best to be polite and finish what we could, it was physically impossible to make what felt like a respectful dent in the final courses. Extra hard given we were already a week into exclusively eating restaurant/hotel meals. The meals were, however, delicious. The wagyu shabu shabu on the second night was one of the best bites of our trip. They also prepared (equally obscenely portioned) kids menus for our son. He loved getting to try lots of different things, though unsurprisingly had tons of leftovers.

Service was fantastic here, and very proactive. When they heard we were planning to walk to the Open Air Museum (a must-do if you’re in Hakone with or without kids, IMO), they fetched the house car and dropped us off, with a business card to call for pickup when we were done. On departure, one of the team members ran into the road in front of the hotel to stop traffic so we could exit. 

They have a lounge with massage chairs that we all enjoyed after dinner. 

The road to get here from Odawara station is a curvy one, something to keep in mind if you’re prone to carsickness.

**Ritz-Carlton Nikko**

Three nights here in a Lake Chuzenji View Suite, which was absolutely stunning. The view when you enter the suite is breathtaking, with the lake and mountains right outside your balcony and visible throughout the room. 

Two separate toilet rooms, one shared shower/bath area. The “sofa bed” is actually a futon mattress they put on top of a daybed. This was a great setup, though this was also the only property of our trip that charged us for the sofa bed setup (10K JPY/nt). I was annoyed by this, especially given it was probably the most lightweight setup we had, and raised it with the GM who waived the fee. 

Much like Hakone, Nikko isn’t spoiled with great hotels like Tokyo and Kyoto are, so the RC sits alone at the top. We’d never visited Nikko before, but we were so glad we decided on a full three days here, as it turned out to be our favorite stop of the trip. There was so much incredible nature in this area, and we enjoyed the hotel’s kayaking excursion, lots of local hikes, and the incredible waterfalls in the area. We also rented their e-bikes (one had a child seat on the back) for a trip to the local temple and the British and Italian embassy villas, which were worthwhile stops.

This hotel goes extremely hard on design, and is gorgeous throughout. The service was also strong, though their  Japanese<>Western style crossover creates some weirdness (e.g. just like a ryokan, they ask you what time you want your breakfast and to pick your Japanese or Western set the night prior, which just feels odd in a Ritz). They also ask you to put your dining trays outside your room when you’re done, which also feels odd and makes the hotel feel cheap when you walk through the hallway and see people’s room service leftovers sitting outside their doors.

Room service breakfast, other than the rigidity with scheduling, was very good here. There was a big group in house during our stay and by the time we thought to try the two in-house restaurants, we couldn’t book at our preferred times. We ate at the bar/lobby lounge a couple of times, and the food was fine. The sushi restaurant across the street from the hotel is great, but you have to have the hotel reserve in advance. They turn away anyone without a reservation. Everything in town closes pretty early so it’s worth planning your dinners unless you want to eat in the lobby lounge every night.

Similar to the FS chat, you can use the Bonvoy app to chat with the team here and coordinate things. Their responsiveness isn’t as good as FS and they seem to deactivate it during busier times, but I still preferred it to having to talk to someone. Service isn’t quite as polished as FS either (e.g. for luggage forwarding, they have you bring it down to the front desk and sit there while they fill out the paperwork, whereas at the FS properties it was always “leave it in your room and we’ll handle everything”…then when you get back to your room, the receipts are already there). 

The gem of the staff was David, who was an utter child whisperer. We booked a scavenger hunt (if you book it with dinner, they take your kid on an adventure and then feed them, giving you 90 minutes to yourself), and David built rapport with our normally reserved son within seconds. Later, complete strangers were stopping us in the hallway to tell us what a great time it looked like our son was having on the excursion. Throughout the stay, David kept appearing to say hi to our son, and he seemed to run all of the kids activities. Another kid-friendly highlight was the “handheld fireworks” (just sparklers, not as pyro as it sounds) activity by the entrance one evening.  

The spa here is superb; both my wife and I enjoyed massages and we both loved going to the onsen and cold plunges here. These are also separated by gender.

It’s worth noting that the natural hot springs do give off an odor that permeates the spa/gym area. Some would describe it as “sulfurous”. My family chose to describe it as “eggy farts”.

We rented a car for the Hakone>Nikko portion of our trip, and I would strongly recommend doing the same if you’re planning on spending multiple days in this area. While the hotel is very walkable to many sights in the immediate vicinity (Kegon falls, the nature center, etc.), our time in Nikko was made much richer by being able to drive to some of the local hiking trails, especially the Senjogahara marshland preserve.

Would happily return here as a family, and certainly hope to one day soon.

Hope this helps anyone considering these hotels for a family trip. Happy to answer any questions.",2,1727966994.0,FATTravel,0,1.0,False

He would always come home miserable but would never really put the effort in to finding a new job. He came home 3 weeks ago and said he got fired. He coaches high school football and left early on the previous Friday and didn’t make up the hours he left early for and his boss fired him that Monday. 

I work 2 jobs remotely (my W-2 and a contract gig) so luckily I can cover all of our bills while he is unemployed. He said he would do all the cleaning, take the time to finish all the projects that needed done around the house, help with the kids, dogs, etc. 

Fast forward 3 weeks. He barely leaves the couch. He’s always been lazy but this is like…bad. He isn’t depressed, he’s LOVING it. And now I’m terrified he will never get a job. He actually qualified for unemployment which scares me because now he’s getting paid to sit at home and do nothing. 

He does clean up the kitchen every night. But he stays up super late playing video games, sleeps on the couch and doesn’t wake up until at LEAST 10 but doesn’t even move until closer to noon. 

It fills me with rage every morning when I get up, get the kids up, make them breakfast, log into work and he’s just snoring away on the couch. 

I asked him to mow the yard so I could put up the Halloween decorations outside which still hasn’t been done. Like how hard is it to MOW??? He has NOTHING TO DO! GO MOW! 

Now I’m so resentful when I pay all these bills myself and he’s just sitting in front of the TV playing video games. If he doesn’t start helping and/or get a damn job, I literally think I might move out with the kids. I can clearly do it on my own and it would be easier and cheaper I believe!

I was also talking with my boss about what happened and she told me her husband was off work for a month due to some union thing and she said how she LOVED it. She said he isn’t the type to sit still so he had the entire house spotless everyday. Went to the store for her. Had her coffee ready every morning for her.

**Tired of stale, stuffy air dampening your dining experience? Say goodbye to unpleasant odours and hello to a breath of fresh air with the latest innovation in technology: commercial air purifiers. In this blog post, we'll explore how installing these game-changing devices can transform your café, restaurant, bar, or club into a haven for clean, crisp air and happy customers. Get ready to elevate your dining experience to new heights!**

 

# Introduction to the importance of indoor air quality in restaurants and cafes

Step into the world of restaurants where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and delectable pastries beckon you. But have you ever stopped to consider the quality of the air you breathe while enjoying your favourite latte or brunch?

Indoor air quality plays a significant role in creating a pleasant dining experience for customers and a healthy work environment for cafe employees. In this blog post, we delve into the game-changer that is commercial air purifiers and how they are revolutionizing fresh dining experiences in cafes.

# Understanding commercial air purifiers and how they work

When it comes to creating a fresh dining experience in restaurants, understanding commercial air purifiers is key. These innovative devices are designed to improve indoor air quality by removing impurities, smoke, odour, and contaminants from the air.

Commercial air purifiers work by drawing in the surrounding air and passing it through a series of filters that capture particles such as dust, pollen, bacteria, and viruses. These filters then release clean, purified air back into the environment.

Some commercial air purifiers also utilize advanced technologies like UV-C light or ionization to further eliminate airborne pathogens and odours. By continuously circulating and filtering the air, these devices help create a healthier and more pleasant dining atmosphere for customers and staff alike.

Incorporating commercial air purifiers into café / restaurant spaces not only enhances indoor air quality but also contributes to overall well-being.

# Benefits of installing commercial air purifiers in cafes

Breathing in clean, fresh air is essential for a pleasant dining experience. When it comes to restaurants, ensuring top-notch indoor air quality is crucial. By installing commercial air purifiers in restaurants, you can significantly improve the overall ambiance and comfort level for both customers and employees.

One of the key benefits of having commercial air purifiers in cafes is the enhanced air quality they provide. These systems work tirelessly to filter out pollutants, dust particles, odours, smoke, and allergens from the air, creating a healthier environment for everyone inside.

Moreover, with cleaner air circulating throughout restaurants, cafes, bars, or clubs, there's a reduced risk of contamination and the spread of illnesses among patrons and staff. This not only improves hygiene standards but also helps maintain a positive reputation for your establishment.

Overall, investing in commercial air purifiers can elevate the dining experience at your place by promoting a healthier environment where customers can relax and enjoy their meals without worrying about poor indoor air quality.

# Improved air quality for customers and employees

Step into a restaurant with fresh, clean air that invigorates your senses as soon as you enter. Imagine taking a deep breath and being greeted by crisp, purified air that enhances your dining experience. Commercial air purifiers play a vital role in creating this inviting atmosphere for both customers and employees.

By installing commercial air purifiers in your restaurant, you can ensure that the air quality is consistently high by keeping the place free from dust, allergens, smoke, and odours. Customers will appreciate the refreshing environment while employees can work in a healthier space without worrying about airborne pollutants affecting their well-being.

Improved air quality not only leads to better health outcomes but also contributes to overall customer satisfaction. When patrons feel comfortable and relaxed in an establishment with clean air, they are more likely to enjoy their meals and return for future visits. So why not elevate your cafe's ambiance with the simple addition of commercial air purifiers?

# Reduced risk of contamination and spread of illnesses

When it comes to running a successful restaurant, ensuring the health and safety of both customers and employees is paramount. One key way to achieve this is by reducing the risk of contamination and the spread of illnesses within your establishment.

Contaminants like dust, allergens, bacteria, and viruses can linger in the air, posing a threat to everyone present. By installing commercial air purifiers in your restaurant, you can effectively filter out these harmful particles, creating a cleaner and healthier indoor environment.

With cleaner air circulating throughout your restaurant, you can significantly lower the chances of airborne diseases spreading among patrons and staff members. This proactive approach not only safeguards everyone's well-being but also helps maintain a positive reputation for your business.

By investing in commercial air purifiers for your restaurant, you are taking a proactive step towards creating a safer and more hygienic dining space for all who walk through your doors.

# Enhanced dining experience for customers

*Picture this: you walk into a cafe, and the air is crisp and clean. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee dances around you as you settle in at your table. You take a deep breath, savouring the pleasant atmosphere that surrounds you.*

With commercial air purifiers silently working in the background, customers can enjoy their meals without any unpleasant odours or airborne particles interfering with their dining experience. The purified air creates a more inviting ambiance, making patrons feel comfortable and relaxed during their visit.

For restaurant owners, investing in commercial air purifiers not only ensures customer satisfaction but also boosts loyalty and positive reviews. Customers are more likely to return to establishments where they feel refreshed and rejuvenated by the quality of indoor air. So why not elevate your cafe's dining experience with cleaner, fresher air for all to enjoy?

# Factors to consider when choosing a commercial air purifier for your restaurant

When selecting a commercial [air purifier for your restaurant](https://atlantahealthcare.in/blogs/wheres-my-air/best-commercial-air-purifier/) or cafe, there are several key factors to keep in mind. Firstly, consider the size of your space and the purifier's coverage area to ensure effective air purification throughout the entire restaurant.

Next, look at the type of filtration system offered by the air purifier.

I’m having a problem with my **Gastroback Design Espresso Advanced Pro G**. I can’t seem to adjust the grinder to a fine enough setting to slow down the extraction. Even with 18g of coffee in the portafilter, I’m getting about 60g of espresso in just 25 seconds, which seems way too fast.

I’ve tried different grind settings (see picture below), and you can see some variation, but even at the finest grind, the espresso is still running too quickly.

I’ve also tested with two different coffee blends: one is a **70/30 Arabica/Robusta** blend, and the other is **10/90 Arabica/Robusta**. Regardless of the blend, I’m still facing the same issue.

Additionally, I’ve always used a **single-wall basket** during these tests.

I’ve attached pictures of the grinder, which doesn’t seem worn or damaged, as well as shots of the portafilter with the 18g dose and the final espresso. Does anyone have an idea what might be causing this or how I can fix it?

Thanks in advance for your help!

1fv98o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildhoodTrauma/comments/1fv98o8/neglect_as_trauma/,Neglect as trauma ? ,"

Hi all, just wanted to ask perspectives on if you think this could be trauma....

My parents were not physical, or emotionally abusive, I am more concerned about the effect of neglect. I don't like to put trauma on anyone, as it is my responsibility to acknowledge and work through therefore making this post is hard. However, I think to work through this I just need confirmation if this is indeed trauma that I've endured. To keep it short, I'm going to put it in bullet form.

-I have no childhood memories of my parents being around
-When I was 12, I can remember my mom stopped working and slept all day. Her schedule was as follows: wake up at 9, have coffee. Watch the news for half hour to an hour, go back to bed for 2-3 hours. Repeat for the day. The most time she was ever up was an hour. To bed at 9pm. 
-my dad worked out of town, so he was gone for 2 weeks and back for two. I have a complicated relationship with him. I always felt peace when he was gone, as he made us tidy up, etc. normal stuff in a house, but my mom never did. We did whatever we wanted when he was gone. He was a quiet person, so never really talked when he was here, but did make some subtle efforts for relationship building, that I now appreciate. He worked this my whole life. 
-my parents openly fought all the time. When my dad was out of town, my mom would swear at him on the phone and slam it down. Then go to bed. When my dad was home, they screamed throughout the house. Daily.
-I left the house a lot to get some.peace and quiet. I had problems, such as a major eating disorder, but I kept it all to myself. I would often lock myself in my room too. 
-this concurred until I moved out at 20. 

Other notable things that may be traumatic:
-finding out an immediate family member who would follow me into rooms, make me feel VERY uncomfortable as a minor, had molested.my sisters. I'm sure I was next on the block, but my instincts kept me safe. My parents said they never let this person around me, which is totally untrue. There were many times I was.left alone with this person. Luckily, nothing happened but again, I think due to my.instincts. When I found out about this person's actions, it was 15 years after, and my parents said I was not allowed to be mad about it because it was so long ago. 

-my mom never attended any of my sporting events or school events. I was a straight a student. My dad did attend all of the above when he could. 
-i ate dinner alone often. I bought the groceries or food was scarce. (I was about 17 at the time I started doing this)
-i brought myself to counselling sessions because I always felt depressed and anxious, but couldn't figure out why. I think I now know why. 

I'm sure there's more, but this is the stuff that comes to the top of my head. Like I said,.not physical or emotionally abusive, but absent. Does this count as trauma? I would like honest opinions, even if you think not. 

Thank you, sincerely someone trying to navigate their journey.

It’s that time of the week again where with a flap of a Raven’s wing, we are transported to beautiful Baltimore to revisit this 2019 Diairist.

I’ll be real with you and say I do not really remember a ton about this diary so this is one that feels like a very fresh read to me. I mostly remember the way she references her partner, whom she truly seems to love. I can only hope that she feels as much love as she gives. 

One thing I find interesting about this diary is the background OOP gives throughout entries. This diary is B.B.Q. (before background questions) but I feel like OOP gives a pretty decent overview of her finances and how she got there. Technically she is in a dual income outcome and without giving the breakdown of his contributions, she includes detail like his grocery contribution and that she covers repairs/renos. Her whole week is detail heavy in general and the style of writing naturally lended to background/context behind the entry. 

I also appreciate an older diarist. When MDs first started they were very millennial focused and the age demographic of diarists represented that fact. I feel like I have been lacking in my age diversity with throwbacks and that’s something I want to correct.

Final thoughts - I love this OOP. I like seeing an older woman, seemingly without children, having a full and fulfilling life. 

As always - let me know your thoughts and send any suggestions you may have.

1fv96u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Heavy_Rise_1401/comments/1fv96u0/i_need_advice/,I need advice,"Hi! I need some advice from someone on the outside. I don’t know if I am overthinking or not. So I (F) am in a 3 year relationship and have a almost 1 year old daughter with my partner. I truly do love my partner but am stuck on the fact that he still has not grown up as a man. He loves and cares for us and after about 5 months of me working after having a baby he told me to stay home and care for our child. He started working his first job (full time) when our baby was about 4-5 months old. I started working at 16 years old so I know what having a job is like as well as working full time with school on to of that. I know it’s not easy but if it’s something I have to do especially if I know I am caring for a family I know I have to work harder to provide. Anyways continuing with the issue, my partner constantly complains about his job (very reasonable to me) but when he’s gets put on schedule to work 6 days straight he always wants to call out for at least 1 other day and gets offend when I tell him no. Which to me is kind of annoying because he is the only one working and chose to do so, so I can stay home and watch over our baby. He does not know how to save and has even said I don’t understand because I stay home all day. Majority of the time I wake up before him to make him at least his coffee and pack his lunch and fall asleep after him due to me cleaning up or working on something. I understand he goes out of the house to work but even just staying home isn’t as easy as some people think. To give you more information we live with his parents so we don’t pay for rent and dont have a lot of bills and for work he either enters at 5am or 6:30am also our baby always wakes up by 5 and even when baby naps I don’t nap because those are the times I get to clean, feed myself, or I am running errands. I truly do love my partner but I feel as if he doesn’t appreciate what I do all the time and that has me stuck on if I should leave or if I should continue to give him time to grow up as a man, but even then I feel like if he really wanted to change he would have done it right when we found out we were pregnant or at least when the baby was born. I don’t understand why I have to be the one to ask him to act like a man. I have no problem getting a job and having him stay home but I know he is not going to do the things that I get done during the day let alone even wake up before me. We tried it for a little while when he was trying to get a job and I already had one. He would fall asleep when the baby took naps and would say “the baby put me to sleep too” and that was his excuse to not picking up around the house or even just make himself food. (He would complain about being hungry when I got home from work…) I think I am just at the point in life where I either want to be dating a man that acts like a man or just be by myself and work hard to provide for my daughter and I. I know it’s not easy but it’s worth doing for my daughter and I know it’s not something that is impossible either. I don’t worry about not having a place to live at because I know my parents would be willing to take us in and finding a job is honestly easy for me I studied so I have a career I can go into. There’s other little things that have build up but I don’t want to make this too long so please advice me if I am overthinking and should just stay and wait till the day a light bulb turns on for him to become a man or give ourselves time apart so hopefully he will want to become one or even I just find one. Also if we break up I really don’t care about having a relationship with someone I really want to focus on providing and taking my time to love myself and figure out what I want for myself because I really don’t want to end up where I am now.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese course on Duolingo.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

First Ali came  then ece came and they had coffee my mother made me some too she called me saying I would like some coffee

I went to Gayem with excitement and hugged her. The man pretended to be Ece but he said I love her so much I love her too I always jump up and come to you when I see her and laughed my mother got very angry when they left she said if you show too much love to someone you become worthless. Also the second incident Ece and Ali made sexual jokes I didn't understand anything. Gayem went to another country she said the men there are tall the ones here are shorter it turns out they talk about that thing I said what's funny I didn't get the joke I said. I said it's rude to make jokes in a way that others won't understand and my mother tried to make me go she got angry she said how old are you girl who shows that you don't understand jokes in front of them I said I'm going to the kitchen relax I said I'm leaving. Ali said I won't play games behind your back I got mad I still don't get the joke here. My mother got very angry when they left you are like a child they were talking about penis size not real size if you didn't understand at least don't show it she said laugh you don't need to understand to laugh because you are alone no one wants you. When you are like a child is the opposite sex a pervert wanting you and finding you attractive she said.

And after my mother snapped at me in front of them and said if you don't understand at least don't show it my brother came and I asked my niece my brother told my me that he was in the car I went to see niece because I was feeling down because of my mother but since my mind was on my mother and I was feeling down I looked through the car. (I normally don't mix because my brother's car is blue and ece's is grey) Ecede said that car is mine and she laughed. While I was already feeling like shit my mother said a lot of things after they left. Okay she is right but nobody is perfect. I usually act to look more mature but sometimes I forget and become myself. Being childish and naive isn't such a bad thing right? but my mother said that I was lonely and unattractive because of this and that I was being devalued because I showed so much love, which really upset me. But sometimes I forget to act. I wish I wasn't like this. I understand my mother's anger, but do you really think I'm in as bad a situation as she says? Please be honest.

I am a newly unexpected caregiver for my mother who was diagnosed with both Alzheimer’s and Dementia last year (Early Stage). She has recently moved into my home and it’s been a difficult transition for me. It has been a roller coaster in researching for caregivers and finding additional resources to help with her care that includes dealing with the department of aging, etc. 

I used up a majority of my pay time off into getting her situated and I believe things are going well until she has an episode in the middle of the night. It’s normally leaves me extremely tired the next morning and being alert and functional at work. Not to mention, I already have my own health to attend to as I am a transplant recipient two years out and there’s been times where I’ve missed my medication.

I figured I come on here to see if anyone else is having the same experiences and wanted to see if we can grab a coffee or have some kind of Respit during the day or after work.

We lived with his parents for two years and it's been a roller coaster ride of a relationship. We planned a trip 2 years ago after visiting a certain location we loved. To be honest I wanted to cancel because I was iffy about us but he asked for a last chance to try fixing our relationship. I was excited, until his uncle who is literally showing signs of dementia tagged along last minute. I have no hate towards him. This family tends to do alot together and I mean celebrate every holiday and weekend so I'm not surprised. Though us who ""came into the family"" know it's alot. And the family themselves can be alot and challenging at times to be involved with. But still I  try to make the best of it. 

We were warned not to take him to be honest but  had no idea it was this bad. I felt for him, he's losing it and he knows it and we wanted to give him a last chance to see the world. Thing was there were only rooms for each couple. But I was told we'd be sharing a room  with boyfriends sister and hubby so I was good. Hey, it's a rare opportunity to see this place. But what I didn't expect was to be told last minute that my boyfriend and I would have to bunk with his uncle. That's when it all went to hell. The thing with this family is that if your not technically family you don't have much a say, your not really acknowledged unless you speak up and are expected to just do whatever they want. His mother assures me that everyone likes me and it will take time. It's been more than 3 years and I find it weird.

I was weirded out and disappointed that we wouldn't have any privacy on OUR vacation. But my boyfriend has a tendency not to care. He does everything for them and expects me to understand ""suck it up."" It bothers him too but just ""deal with it."" I have not had a decent night sleep for almost two weeks. Uncle uses a bright flashlight to get in and out of the room 3 times every night to pee and flashes it all around the room, waking us up. He makes coffee every morning, and it's watery even though he was asked not to. And I have to sneak in and remake it or my boyfriends dad. We also all caught a virus and spent a whole week isolated in the cabin. He did not wash his hands much, would dig in the food and touch everything and everyone's stuff. Not to mention he messes with the thermostat and roasts us all some nights.

Now we are feeling better in the second cabin in another location, only for my boyfriend to say ""hey give my uncle the queen bed and we will have the bunks."" His family agreees.My jaw dropped. The bunk is a full bed, but it's ""hard for him tonget out"" even though he just napped on it fine and got up. I mean, I get it, but his sister also has a queen bed that's free. Though she ended up getting pregnant so I understood that too. but it was boiling over for me. I'm also not allowed to keep the door shut only when changing because he's incapable of just knocking and asking (he's very much there enough to do so he just doesn't like bothering anyone as they say so I need to be more considerate). The last blow came when his mom insisted on moving all my belongings into her room so that he could put all his luggage up to reach. I was still a little sick, and little tipsy and tired and had enough. I get up a bit earlier for our hikes because there's 5 to one bathroom so I try to be ready and not in the way. She still doesn't get it. And then when I refuse and say it's too much ""she  says ""well I raised my children to be considerate"". I had to walk away because I was pissed. Of course she'd came and apologized, I know it's more about not wanting him to touch my belongings. She tried to reassure me and tell me it will never happen again and that they are all over it. 

I been putting up with it all, being uncomfortable because never in my life did anyone I know expect a couple to share bedroom with a man without talking with them first. I also told his mom of my childhood rape trauma. I just never feel comfortable sleeping with men in general. I had been trying my best to be happy and smile and make his uncle feel comfortable. Cleaning after him, disinfecting everything ect. My boyfriend had called me selfish a few hours before because he had to turn back on the hike we've been wanting to try to take his uncle back because he couldn't make it, even though everyone told him not to go. I was upset, but i understood. i was really mad at the fact he took my only water and food supplies with him. The hike was 7 hours long. I woke up this morning, though, to make coffee, and it was a whole other debate. See, his family acknowledges it was wrong, but when I do it, my boyfriend says, ""I hate his family."" He's also been ignoring me and not talking to me much but saying everything's fine. He always has a thing of treating everyone differently than me. Like he doesn't care as much.

I'm so over it. AITA for feeling this way?  I have no hate towards his uncle. I'm just literally exhausted and tired of how my boyfriend treats me and what he expects from me.

1fv90ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1fv90ex/low_cholesterol_diet_and_urine_ketone_related/,Low Cholesterol Diet and Urine Ketone related?,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice regarding my new chapter, since I'm quite confused and I don't want to make mistakes.

A week ago, both me (33 M) and my wife (38 F) went for a whole health screening (Blood, Urine, ECG, Ultrasound, Chest X-Ray, etc)
Luckily everything went ok, except for one thing: High Cholesterol.
In my case, it was the first time and in the case of my wife she already had high cholesterol but now it is higher.
Both were really high (LDL +200), so of course we took it seriously.

I blame it especially on the sedentary life we have been carrying since COVID times, plus the reality is that we live in Malaysia where there are literally no pedestrian walkways, so everything is done in a car, plus our work from home didn't help.
Of course food wise as well, but we never eat almost fried stuff, no sugar/sodas, and relatively ""healthy"", but Malaysia is known for its extremely unhealthy (but delicious) food, so like it or not, you are surrounded by it.

Since the day we did the health screening, we started to run everyday at least one hour up and downhill, weights lifting at least 4 days a week, and we changed our whole food habits (plus no drinking/smoking for a while before).
Basically we stop eating any red meat, any processed foods, no sugars, milk/dairy products, no fried food and we reduce the amount of poultry.

To give you an idea of what we are eating for the last two weeks (different depending on the day):

Breakfast - Oatmeal/Greek Yogurt with Mixed Berries, Apple/Banana, Nuts (Almond, Cashew, Walnut), Natural Peanut Butter, Wholemeal Toast, Green Tea/Coffee 

Lunch - Steam and oven baked Vegetables (Carrot, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes, Corn, Red Pepper, Onion, Pumpkin), Homemade Humus/Muhammara, Falafel, Green salad with olives, Skinless chicken Breast (1-2 times per week), Salmon (1-2 times per week), Miso Soup with Tofu, Beans/Lentils

Dinner- Same foods as lunch

Everything went fine for the last two weeks, actually feeling better both physically and mentally, waking up with more energy and better mood (probably the night run before bed is doing its work as well).

But today we had an issue.
My wife went yesterday for her Pap and Urine test (last week she can't do it due to her period) and today for the Urine test results.
Her Urine Ketone is 3+, which indicates that is ""Critical"" range.
I checked mine from last week (before we start the ""diet"") and was ""Negative"".

We tried to learn about this Ketone, since we never heard before of it, and after talking with some people and reading online about it, we ended up with the only possibility for this: the change of diet.

Both my wife and I are not diabetic, our blood tests were fine.
So that's the only ""logical"" explanation to it.
Tomorrow she will try to contact the doctor to ask about it, but since then we would like to get some explanation/advices about this situation.

I was thinking as well if I should do another urine test to check if now, after a week of food changes, I have my Ketone level high as well or still Negative, because that would confirm the reason, but not sure if it's worth it.

Also, are we doing a good ""diet""? We are making mistakes?
What changes we should do?
Please, enlighten us 🙏

Thank you in advance!

TL.DR:
Wife and I got a blood test with the only issue being a high cholesterol (LDL +200).
We started doing daily exercise and changed our diet (No red meat, fried food, sugar, processed food, milk/dairy products).
Two weeks in, my wife had to do urine test and Ketone Level is +3 (Critical range).
Mine before change of diet was Negative (not sure now 2 weeks after)
Looking for an explanation in case to be related to the new habits.

1fv8zzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1fv8zzd/stereotyping_the_different_genres_of_photography/,Stereotyping the different genres of photography,"Obviously, just for fun, just my own thoughts, and definitely not exhaustive of all genres. Feel free to add your own interpretations.

1. **Macrophotography**: This is my wheelhouse and these photographers are usually awkward social recluses that like to play with bugs, know way too much about botany and enjoy having people guess what they hell they took a shot of, like turning the bark of a tree into a bizarre alien landscape that is completely unrecognizable. They often don't leave the house because even a pebble or a leaf can become the subject of a whole series.

2. **Portraiture**: These are normal, well adjusted photographers that know how to talk and interact with real people. The best are the life of the party and able to make their subjects feel comfortable and get those genuine smiles rather than merely having their subjects ""pose.""

3. **Street photography**: These are the trendy go-getters that like to travel to other countries (esp. Europe) and probably have armsleeve tattoos, wear a baseball cap backwards and might run a youtube channel. Strong hipster vibes from these ones, photographs have to be captured by ""getting out there."" They're all about being ""in the moment"" and will gaslight themselves into finding meaning within a mediocre, often messy composition (typically about, like, you know, about ""society"").

4. **Wedding photography**: Business people at the end of the day, they are professional, efficient and get the job done. They might not be as ""artistic"" as other genres in the obvious ways, but they have a great understanding of photography fundamentals given the wide array of venues they might find themselves in.

5. **Concert photography**: They probably have nose rings and maybe a goth aesthetic, but their skills are not to be underestimated, given the challenges of shooting low light action shots without flash. Stimulants swim through their blood, probably.

6. **Wildlife photography**: These are the photographers that sit in the mud for hours in the cold rain with their giant-ass telephoto lens waiting for that bird to do what they want. They probably wear Carhartt beanies with a plaid jacket and get up at the crack of dawn along with the animals.

7. **Astrophotography**: These people live on a diet of gas station coffee and beef jerky and typically drive out into the middle of nowhere (i.e., New Mexico desert) while everyone is asleep. They eat shitty cheap food because all their money is allocated to their gear.

8. **Landscape**: This is like the outdoors hipster equivalent of the street photographer. If street photographers give off hipster-craft-beer vibes, these people have hipster-pour-over-coffee vibes. Less dandy, more Bohemian. Their favorite subjects are abandoned buildings in the middle of nowhere and whereas the street photographer gaslights themselves into thinking their cluttered chaotic compositions are ""capturing a moment,"" the landscape photographer's minimalist comps are ""telling a story.""

9. **Documentary/Journalist**: These are the people with a strong sense of social cause and aspire to have their lens capture history with an iconic shot that will be immortalized in our cultural lexicon. Sadly, there are plenty of boring assignments they probably get and the most desirable opportunities are also the most dangerous (but the cameraman never dies, so it's cool).

10. **Still-life**: They spend more time arranging their random assortment of objects than actually taking photos. They may have failed as a painter and ended up ""finding their niche"" in still life, meticulously spending an exorbitant amount of time placing each piece of fruit ""just so."" Their portfolio blends in perfectly on Pinterest.",3,1727965526.0,photography,15,0.59,False

inb4: Sorry for the long post but if you’re really stressed, anxious, and struggling, give it a read. 

I passed my theory for the first time today with less than a week of revision (because I’m lazy, I don’t recommend doing this). 

My experience:
The test is surprisingly easy and the questions asked are the same as that of the official DVSA Theory Test App (the one I used) though worded differently. I can’t speak for other apps such as the 4-in-1 and Driving Theory by James May but I believe they use the same database so the practice and mock questions for the apps are more or less identical with maybe a few differences including extra features. 

When I walked in I was asked to grab a number, turn all electronic devices off, and to sit and wait to be called. They (staff) may seem rude and short tempered but don’t let this affect your mood as this can only put you down if you already feel anxious and nervous. Remember, this is an official test required by law for you to be on the road, they’re likely just following procedures. Don’t take it personally and keep your confidence up. I literally just looked at a locker with information on it and the woman sternly said “Don’t worry about the lockers for now, I will call you when I’m ready” so with great annoyance I answered with “I was only reading what was on it, is that a problem?” Seemed to have made the room full of people feel at ease and make a face of support (she was giving everyone an attitude earlier on, again, probably just following procedures). 

I was then called up, presented my provisional and told to say my full name (as on my prov.) into a camera, asked which test I was taking (car), and signed an electronic board. I was then given a locker key to put my things in. I stupidly brought a backpack full of things (as I needed to be somewhere after). If you can, avoid bringing anything else other than your provisional license. I was told to sit down once more and wait to be called in for a final check. 

After being called, I went to room where I was briefed on what the test is, where to go, and what to do and not to do. They checked my pockets, ears, and clothing to make sure I didn’t have anything (it’s not worth cheating). I’m not sure what the procedure is for those with religious clothing such as Islamic Veils as they will still need to check your ears to make sure you don’t have anything that will assist you. You’re also not allowed gum or water even if it’s a clear water bottle. They then assigned me to a computer where I did my test. 

After the test, I left the room through a different way back to reception, again waiting to be called up (after taking my things out of the locker) to hand in the locker key, show my provisional, and get given my results on a piece of paper (you will also get an email regarding your results [without the scores]). They won’t tell you if you pass and will just get you to make sure that the certificate (the paper with your results in) is yours (name and driving licence number matches your provisional). 

The test:
The test was surprisingly easy. Considering that I revised only for 3 days even though I booked it at the start of September. There will be introductory videos explaining everything and a chance to practice how the test is. My practice question was “What colour is the grass?” and given multiple choice. If you asked for headphones (this helped me) the questions will be read out to you and so will the answers when you click on them. The questions asked were the same as the ones in the DVSA Theory Test App but they are worded differently. I managed to finish the test in 10 minutes (out of 57) and used about 10 minutes to go through them and make sure I answered everything to the best of my ability. All 50 questions were multiple choice with the last few being video-based. Make sure you watch the video first and then play it each time when printed with a question.

After the multiple choice part, you’re given 3 minutes until the hazard perception section. As I had plenty of time left before, I didn’t use this 3 minutes as I basically took a 10 minute break after checking my answers before ending the first section. 

When starting the hazard perception section, an introductory video (the same as the DVSA Theory Test App) will play, make sure to watch this even if you’ve already seen it 100 times before. You will then be asked if you want to practice, make sure you do this so you can do get used to it before starting. Once the test starts, there will be a 10 second timer at the beginning of each video to make sure you are ready to click. In my test, 3-4 videos from the app showed up. This may or may not be the case for you so don’t rely on the videos from the app you’re using to show up. I had one clip with two hazards on and unfortunately only scored 6/10. Make sure to keep watching even if you think you’ve got the hazard as the double hazard clip can come at any time. I used the 3 click method (explained below) for this section which worked really well.

Some tips:
I would have included actual examples of questions and hazard perceptions that was in the DVSA Theory Test App but I’m not sure if that’s allowed so here are some tips. 

•Give yourself plenty of time for revision. I had a whole month (and more to revise) and I only revised 3 days before my test. Try to do two topics, two quick tests (on those topics) and two mock tests even if you haven’t studied the other topics. Your score should gradually go up if you’re progressing. 

•Read the each topics carefully and at the very least skim through the Highway Code (HC) though reading it will help you. The topics section in the official app was really the only thing I used as 1. They were mostly what is important and 2. I had no time to read the whole of the HC, though if you prep enough time before your test, you should read the HC. 

•Do not have caffeine. I’m a coffee addict and had a double shot iced latte an hour before my test and it made me nervous when I was perfectly fine. I do recommend having a light snack beforehand and a drink of water but not too much or you’ll need the toilet (which I was permitted but I didn’t need it. The test also cannot be paused). 

•For hazard perception, do all of the videos available on the app you are using. There’s only 34 clips on the official DVSA Theory Test App but more on others. I did the hazard perception after doing the topics but if you are worried, do 1-3 clips per revision session and try to get a max score on them BEFORE you check where you should be clicking to get a score of 5. I also did the 3 click method when I revised and on the test. The three click method is fairly simply; when you see a potential hazard, click ONCE. If said hazard starts to develop click ONCE more, wait a maximum of 1 second and click again. This will increase your chance of getting at least a score of 3 on each one of the clips. (Do further research as my explanation isn’t very good). Once you’re confident with this method or any other method, use it in your test, it will majorly help. 

•If you’ve completed every topic and score at least 43/50 on your mock tests, carry on. Do not stop revising until an hour of your arrival (you will be asked to turn your phone off immediately) to not overload yourself. Read the topics you struggle with the most, do quick test and do at least 2 mock tests on the day of your test. 



That’s the best I can do for now, if you have any questions I’ll be more than happy to help. 

I now have to fight for cancellations or wait till March to do my practical.
