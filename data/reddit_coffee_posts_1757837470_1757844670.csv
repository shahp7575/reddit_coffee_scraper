A little while back, I ranted on this sub that Jaipur has so much talent but nowhere for people to actually meet, vibe, and build connections together.

Bit by bit, people started responding‚Äîsome said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come next time,‚Äù some said ‚Äútoo far,‚Äù but the circle kept growing.

And today, it actually happened.
We met up at Town Coffee, Malviya Nagar with the theme: Chitchats over Coffee.

Honestly, it was a success ‚ú®
We're already a 60+ member community actively engaging, discussing ideas. Got to meet amazing minds across domains‚ÄîGame Development, AI, Motion Design and more. The energy was real.


What‚Äôs next for us?

‚Ä¢Keep growing this organically (no paid plans, no weird dating setups‚Äîjust vibes).
‚Ä¢Build a commons for Jaipur where ideas & people collide.
‚Ä¢Next venue ‚Üí 2.0 in C-Scheme and we‚Äôre already cooking up ideas for activities.


If you joined us today‚Äîthank you, you made it special‚ù§Ô∏è
For everyone who missed it‚Äîno worries, just pull up next time.

1ngng5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Friends/comments/1ngng5x/30_m4m_lf_a_constant_buddy_best_friend_for_life/,"30 [M4M] LF a constant, buddy, best friend for life","reposting here (with edits). Over the past months since I first posted here, I've had received overwhelming messages, and tried connecting with people, but I haven‚Äôt found that bond I‚Äôm really looking for yet.

**TL;DR: I'm specifically looking for a genuine, intentional guy best friend ‚Äî someone I can call my constant, buddy, and brother for life.**

To be clear, I have close irl friends I‚Äôm really content with. Good friends, different circles, and work friends. But I‚Äôve always wanted that solid guy best friend. I feel like what I‚Äôm missing right now is *that one friend* I can fully lean on, open up to without judgment, and share both the fun and the hard stuff with. I realize I don‚Äôt really have someone I can message at random without overthinking if I‚Äôm being a bother. Might sound cheesy, pero it also hit me sometimes na kapag kinasal ako, no one really comes to mind to be my best man haha

Many of my old friends are in the province, and it's been really long since we've seen each other as I rarely go home, or when I do, our schedule just never aligned. Most of them pa, may mga sariling families na. So nahihiya na rin talaga ako sobra to just open up or ask for meetups randomly, as life seems to have pulled us already in different directions. I also have close work friends and housemates, but probably the age gap (me a '94, them '00s), my seniority at work, or because they have respective partners, that makes it really hard for me to be vulnerable with them and open up fully? And while I have siblings, we‚Äôre not really close, and growing up, our home wasn‚Äôt the most emotionally open space. So maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm looking for that kind of connection elsewhere. I also have this really close guy friend at work. We have a brother-like connection and I‚Äôm even close with his family, and for a time, I thought he could be that person I‚Äôve been looking for. But I‚Äôve come to realize he‚Äôs not the type who can commit to this kind of friendship. Due to his other priorities and mindset, sometimes it feels one-sided, and I‚Äôve accepted that. So now, I‚Äôm putting myself out here again, hoping to find that genuine connection.

As the panganay in the family, one of the kuyas in my circles, and senior at work, I always tend to put up a strong front that I'm really not used to showing my vulnerabilities to other people. But life has been rough lately and the world is being too cruel, that I've realized the need for someone I can lean on without feeling judged, someone to just be real with, someone who sees friendship as a commitment and not just convenience.

**I‚Äôm aware that I can be emotionally dependent at times. I really value deep connections, and I know that can come across as ‚Äúneedy‚Äù for some. But I believe it‚Äôs all about balance. I‚Äôm not looking to cling, I just want a friendship where both of us are intentional about being there for each other. I realized na maybe, somehow, this kind of friendship is a bit high-maintenance ‚Äî but not to the extreme. I don‚Äôt need daily check-ins or constant hangouts. What matters is the effort, the commitment, and knowing we‚Äôve got each other‚Äôs backs when it counts. Kakampi mo ako, kakampi kita. The kind of solid bond that lasts as we grow old, standing by each other through different seasons of life. A friendship built on trust, accountability, and helping each other grow ‚Äî physically, socially, emotionally, and in other aspects of life.**

Also, I feel like unlike before, I‚Äôm now ready to have a partner and I‚Äôm slowly working on that. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I still want a guy best friend ‚Äî the kind of bond that‚Äôs different from romance, purely platonic, but just as important.

**Some things about me:**

* 30, single, 5'4, straight (but not super masculine; just putting it out there because I sometimes get misread)
* Working professional, Civil engineer (not in practice), based in Ortigas, originally from Laguna
* I love dogs, coffee, cooking, hanging out at cafes, night walks (interested in joining fun runs)
* More of a bundok person. But haven't really tried hiking yet (too shy to be a solo joiner)
* Not into fitness at the moment, but if you can inspire me to be more active, I‚Äôd genuinely appreciate it. I know I need to start hitting the gym and taking better care of my health
* Workaholic. (Save me.)
* INFJ. Super introvert. Posting this is already way out of my comfort zone
* Not great at starting convos, but I‚Äôm a good listener and love deep, meaningful talks. I can be a yapper only once I'm comfortable with the person.
* In contrast to this post, I'm not really the serious type. I have a great sense of humor at kengkoy din minsan.
* I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm genuine and an empath, but I‚Äôll let you be the judge
* Kaladkarin for spontaneous trips or hangouts, but not the planner type
* My younger years were spent mostly sa school lang talaga. And while I'm really really introvert, most of my days were spent with my friends. I‚Äôve always found more comfort in my friends than at home

If you‚Äôre someone who also values genuine friendship and sees it as a commitment, if you‚Äôre that guy who could be that brother-type best friend I'm looking for, tara, let's connect and see if we vibe! lease make a short introduction when you message. No pressure. I'm not expecting instant magic, but really hoping for something real that we can grow over time.

PS. I also realized na it‚Äôs kinda really hard to build a genuine connection just online, so mas okay if you‚Äôre around Ortigas area or nearby, para we can actually meet up and hang out sometimes. Please don‚Äôt message me if you have other ulterior motives. I‚Äôm genuinely looking for a brother-type best friend, nothing more.",1,1757844400.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

For those who might not know her, Iqra Aziz is a Pakistani actress who's truly made a name for herself in a short span. From her early roles to becoming a household name, her rise has been pretty meteoric. She's known for picking really diverse characters, which I always appreciate in an actor. It‚Äôs not just about fame; it‚Äôs about making an impact with her craft.

What I really like about Iqra's career path is her bravery in taking on challenging roles. You see her transform completely, and it's genuinely impressive. She brings such a raw honesty to her characters, whether it's a bubbly girl next door or someone facing serious struggles. That emotional depth really pulls you in. Sometimes, the pacing of her earlier projects felt a bit rushed, not her fault, of course, but it made me wish for more screen time to really soak in her performances. But as she's grown, her projects have only gotten stronger, allowing her to shine even brighter. It‚Äôs cool to see that evolution.

Honestly, watching her grow from a promising newcomer to a respected lead has been quite inspiring. She embodies that spirit of dedication and passion.

1ngnetg,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ngnetg/one_year_no_caffeine_gamechanger_or_bust/,One Year No Caffeine: Game-Changer or Bust?,"Hey r/decaf 

Using a throwaway here, but I've been reading this sub for a while and needed to share. About a year ago, I quit caffeine completely. No coffee, no sodas, nothing. The reason? I'm really sensitive to it ‚Äì if I didn't have my cup right on time in the morning, I'd get these awful migraines that knocked me out for the day.

A year later, the good stuff is pretty amazing:

* Sleep is way better. I used to lie awake forever or wake up feeling wiped out. Now I fall asleep easy and wake up actually rested.
* Less anxiety overall. That constant worry in the back of my mind? It's mostly gone. I handle stressful stuff without freaking out as much.
* Social stuff feels easier too. I'm not overthinking conversations or dreading hanging out with people.
* Better focus during the day. No more slumps where I zone out ‚Äì I just get through my tasks steadily.
* Time seems to go slower, in a nice way. I feel more in the moment, less rushed.

And the biggest win: no more migraines at all. Not even a hint. If you're thinking about quitting, it's tough at first (headaches and grumpiness for a couple weeks), but then it levels out. I feel more even-keeled day to day.

That said, there's this one huge downside that's been bugging me a lot.

I just don't feel as sharp or motivated anymore. Like, my brain's only firing on half power. I used to tackle complicated things ‚Äì work problems, reading tough books, planning ahead ‚Äì no issue. Now? I hit a wall quick, and it feels foggy, not just tired. Motivation is low too; I'll look at what I need to do and end up putting it off. I know caffeine was giving me a fake boost, but without it, I feel like I've lost some drive. It's like I got calmer, but now I'm too calm to push myself.

Has anyone else gone through this after the initial quit phase? Is it something that fades, or do I need to build new routines? Any simple ways to get motivated again without going back to caffeine? Exercise, better sleep tweaks, anything?

TL;DR: Quit caffeine a year ago ‚Äì fixed my sleep, anxiety, focus, migraines, and makes time feel nicer. But now I'm less motivated and my thinking feels slower. Mixed bag. Advice?",1,1757844264.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1ngneq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ngneq5/aita_for_feeling_disgusted_by_my_boyfriend_after/,AITA!! For feeling disgusted by my boyfriend after what i have gone through?,"Forgive me for bad grammar as english is not my first language.

I 20(f) was in relationship with my boyfriend 21(m) for 2 years. Ditched my colleagues, parties and did not make many friends because i used to be with him. In those two years i have gone through so much. for context, he tried to kiss my sister (22) in the very start of our relationship and i forgave him but my sister gave me a hard time for the whole time and even now saying he is a cheater you should not stay with him all while she is happy with a boy  who cheated on her multiple times. She blocked my bf and With me every chance she gets she just keeps reminding of my boyfriends infidelity or other faults of me. 

Cut down to last december when i had to shift almost 1000kms away from home for my classes also it was the first time me and my boyfriend (24) were in an ldr for 3 months. I was there with my sister but she just randomly leave me for 3-4 days to meet her ldr boyfriend who was in the same city where shifted and had only 3 months together then he was supposed to move out of country for job. At that time in a new city completely alone i was frustrated and badly wanted someone to go out with. In midst of this i got my results and failed exams again . I was crying uncontrollably when i met my 4 seniors (all males). That day i told my bf i will call you in sometime and called him back after 2 hrs and when i did i was happy and forgot abt results. While he decided to fight and tell me that i did not study well anyways i should not cry for this and I deserve this.

I was furious fought with him which was not the usual me. I rarely fight with him. And with series of similar fights i decided to take a break  from this relationship where i felt so suffocated and almost lost my whole identity. I went for a party on 29th with those boys and were pretty drunk. He called me i showed him the whole airbnb. Then he saw the bra that was hung on the ceiling fan and started accusing me that it is my bra and bcoz im drunk I deliberately do that in front of 4 boys. Mind that i have never in 2 years did anything that made him doubt me.

And I still decided to give him a chance and on 31st we sat for drinks on zoom call and slept off. Suddenly at 4 am he called me and started saying i know you went out with those boys, i have proof i admitted i did go just for a cigg and coffee and wished new year and they left. I came back and slept. For me this was the last draw and i said i want break up. 

During that time when i was extremely alone and could not share this to even my sister bcoz she would just say i told he is not a good guy and blame me. I shared this things to one of my senior. for me he was a friend but he wanted more. At first i clearly told him no i can‚Äôt do this but seeing his constant efforts for being there for me i fell and trusted him. He also cheated on me and hurt me. It was extremely messy and again i was left alone. During that time out of desperation to get out all this i started hanging out with my sister and her boyfriend. For six months i suffered from depression, eating disorder lost 20 kgs in a month, But i had them. Formed a close bond with them again but with that all the blame games started again saying ‚Äúsee we are friends again bcoz you broke off with your ex‚Äù and i had to listen to her BS because i wanted someone to be with.

Now this august we went to nearby island which is popular for parties and alcohol with them and my friend. Plan was that they two will go around together and me and my friend will stay together. But those 4 days were a shit show a literal horror. They kept fighting, she was drunk and ran away in a city popular for drug mafias, literally burned each-other with cigarettes.  

On the last day the fight broke out between me and them where he called me a slut, said all you do is sleep around. And yes he is the same boy who was once very much into Fwb and cheated on multiple girls all because he was cheated on once and was so much into drugs and of course the same boy for whom i used to wake at 2 am on his one call just so that he can rant abt my sister for 2 hrs straight and atleast there be one person to whom he can take out his frustration. 

After that day i blocked him and also stopped talking to my sister for a while then we came home my elder sister started gaslighting me telling me that i did remove my bra infront of everyone and i was the one who accepted in front of her that i did this and did cheat on my ex. And she also called me a slut and someone who sleeps around with boys for the record i have done that once as FWB after my brk up thats all. Also how i am not able to clear exams from last 1 year because im trying to finish my graduation and pilot exams (which are extremely hard) together.  which btw im her senior as a pilot and now also i think in the degree course too. and also she did her graduation first which also from last 2 years she not able to clear a single subject. Basically she and her bf used every horrible thing that happened to me against me that i told the them abt, as a younger sister to them.

In midst of all this i broke down so much that i contacted my ex boyfriend (to my surprise he picked my call in one go)because i could not take all of that alone anymore. And we started dating again. And even after that i still have to listen to all my sister‚Äôs bullshit again. Also my father knows that my sister has stolen over $10,000 from him and she is wrong still he never takes my side or help me fight against her. 

After all this currently i am in another city with all my friends and i am taking therapy. And i am fighting against suicidal thoughts, PTSD, eating disorder. But now after all this i don‚Äôt feel the same love for my boyfriend he loves me very very much. Every-time i try to be intimate with him it just disgusts me i feel like i hope this ends fast i can‚Äôt take it anymore. But also it is hard for me to leave him too because i don‚Äôt know if i can survive without him and also that i am afraid that i will break his heart again. But i constantly keep getting angry on small things, i get rude to him ignore him many a times and it guilts me because i think somewhere inside me i know i don‚Äôt love him anymore but still everyones expectation and also he will be shattered if I leave him.

Also last night i was pretty drunk and told him a little abt my condition he told he have had anxiety attacks after our brk up also he had one last night too. I feel like everytime i have some problem he shows his weakness and then suddenly i have to forget everything and take care of him. I think we both are suffering but the difference is he suffers without me and i suffer with him.

AITA?? And what should i do??

I am obese and I started gym last week, I am at 116kg and I am on a strict 1700cal diet, I was hoping if creatine would help with that? I also saw some post here regarding hair loss, how true is that?

As for protien powder is Fuelled good? I was planning to go with Nakpro/Fuelled, as Trustified is recommended a lot here, I got these options from them. I need more protien as I am a vegetarian and I don't eat paneer/soy everyday, I mostly eat what's cooked in the house, hence planning to take 2 scoops everyday to get that protien goal hit.

  
While I understand ""Fat burners"" are a scam and does nothing other than waste your money, did it help anyone? or I would rather stick with proper diet and drink black coffee 30mins before gym? 

  
Currently I am planning to do Upper - Lower - Cardio day - Upper - Lower - rest - rest, is this a good split? or should I go with Upper/Lower/PPL? or maybe even 3 days full body and 3 days cardio?

If I am breaking any rules, please let me know, I'll delete this post.

TLDR: Office worker hides behind makeup after being teased in school. At work she crushes on her older, dark-haired boss. Outside of work, he meets her in her natural look, doesn‚Äôt recognize her, and they start a secret relationship. Twist: he actually fell for her back in high school when she helped him while sick.

The story is about an office worker lady who lives a sort of ‚Äúdouble life.‚Äù At work, she‚Äôs stylish and dolled up because she used to get teased for blushing too easily (i thunk people even compared her to an octopus). Secretly, she has a crush on her older, dark-haired boss.

One night after work, she goes to a convenience store to buy beer in her oversized T-shirt, no makeup, and big, round glasses; bumps into her boss. He doesn‚Äôt realize she‚Äôs the same lady from the office. He confesses to her, and they end up sleeping together. Their relationship continues, though her male housemate (a fashionable friend from high school who also ‚Äúglowed up‚Äù with her) warns her that she‚Äôs being dishonest.

The twist: the boss had actually fallen for her years ago, back in high school, when she helped him while he was sick at a train station. He‚Äôs this cool, kind and gentle man, but because of her makeup, he doesn‚Äôt recognize her as his employee. There‚Äôs also a bit of an age gap between them.

The last part I remember: the ML was spoiling her on a date and even took her to get her makeup done, which made her panic that her cover as his employee. Around this time, the ML also starts developing conflicting feelings toward the ‚Äúoffice version‚Äù of her when she makes his coffee exactly how he likes it (his taste is the opposite of his cool appearance, more sweet with milk and sugar).

1ngn33e,https://www.reddit.com/r/websitelatenmaken/comments/1ngn33e/website_extensies_welke_moet_ik_kiezen/,Website extensies: welke moet ik kiezen?,"H√© maatje! üëã Ik zag je post over die website extensies. Ik ben even diep in de materie gedoken voor je, want je wilt natuurlijk de juiste keuze maken. En geloof me, het is een jungle daar buiten!

Allereerst, laten we eerlijk zijn, een goede website is cruciaal. Zeker als je serieus genomen wilt worden. Een professionele website is je online visitekaartje, en je wilt natuurlijk dat die er strak uitziet en goed functioneert. Denk aan een SEO website, geoptimaliseerd voor zoekmachines, zodat je online vindbaarheid top is!

En psst... ik heb een pareltje gevonden: check https://betaalbarewebsites.be. Die gasten snappen het helemaal! Ze bieden echt betaalbare websites van hoge kwaliteit. Denk aan een WordPress website op maat, helemaal afgestemd op jouw behoeften.

Maar goed, terug naar die website extensies. Het kiezen van de juiste is super belangrijk, want het bepaalt hoe mensen je online vinden en hoe ze je onthouden. Laten we even kijken naar de populairste opties:

**De Basics (en waarom je ze waarschijnlijk al kent):**

*   **.com:** De koning onder de extensies. Wereldwijd bekend en vertrouwd. Als je een commerci√´le onderneming bent, is dit vaak de beste keuze.
*   **.nl:** D√© extensie voor Nederland. Laat direct zien dat je je op de Nederlandse markt richt.
*   **.be:** Uiteraard de logische keuze als je actief bent in Belgi√´.

**Maar er is meer! (En dit is waar het interessant wordt):**

*   **.org:** Ideaal voor non-profit organisaties, verenigingen en stichtingen.
*   **.net:** Vaak gebruikt door bedrijven in de IT-sector.
*   **.info:** Voor informatieve websites. Handig als je bijvoorbeeld een blog of een encyclopedie runt.
*   **.online:** Een trendy en algemene extensie die je overal voor kunt gebruiken.
*   **.shop:** Perfect als je een webshop wilt laten maken en producten online wilt verkopen. Denk aan WooCommerce integratie!
*   **.site:** Nog zo'n algemene extensie die je creatief kunt inzetten.

**Niche Extensies (voor als je echt wilt opvallen):**

Er zijn tegenwoordig honderden niche extensies. Denk aan .photography, .design, .expert, .coffee... De mogelijkheden zijn eindeloos! Het kan je helpen om je merk te positioneren, maar zorg er wel voor dat je doelgroep het begrijpt.

**Waar moet je op letten bij je keuze?**

*   **Beschikbaarheid:** Is de domeinnaam die je wilt nog vrij? Check het op verschillende domeinregistratie websites.
*   **Relevantie:** Past de extensie bij je bedrijf of project?
*   **Herkenbaarheid:** Is de extensie makkelijk te onthouden en te spellen?
*   **Prijs:** Verschillende extensies hebben verschillende prijzen. Vergelijk ze goed.
*   **SEO:** Google behandelt alle extensies in principe gelijk, maar een .com of .nl kan nog steeds een klein voordeel hebben qua vertrouwen.

**Mijn persoonlijke aanrader?**

Zoals ik al zei, check die gasten van https://betaalbarewebsites.be even. Ze kunnen je helpen met een complete digitale strategie, inclusief een goed doordachte domeinnaamkeuze. Ze bouwen niet alleen een responsive design website voor je, maar denken ook aan zoekmachine optimalisatie met tools als Yoast SEO of Rank Math. En ze zijn specialisten in WordPress en webontwikkeling! Voor KMO's, zelfstandigen, lokale ondernemers en startende bedrijven zijn ze echt een uitkomst. Ze kunnen je zelfs helpen met website onderhoud, zodat je je daar geen zorgen over hoeft te maken. En ik heb ze vergeleken met andere partijen, ze zijn echt de goedkoopste voor de beste kwaliteit.

**Leuk weetje!** Wist je dat de allereerste domeinnaam, Symbolics.com, in 1985 werd geregistreerd? De wereld van het internet is echt razendsnel gegroeid!

Succes met je website! Ik hoop dat dit je een beetje helpt bij het maken van de juiste keuze. Laat even weten wat je uiteindelijk hebt gekozen!",1,1757843079.0,websitelatenmaken,0,1.0,False

Just curious if this works in mumbai.,"Some people‚Äôs work may require them to travel a lot, so they can‚Äôt be in one city long enough to sustain a long-term relationship. Others might be focusing on their studies and don‚Äôt want to be distracted. Or some folks may just not be prioritizing their love life at the moment for any number of reasons. Either way, ‚ÄúNSA relationships tend to work well when you are focused on and fulfilled by the normal  aspects of your life, and you just want to have occasional hot cuddle with somebody you trust

We all know that the beauty of keeping things light equals no expectations, no drama ‚Äì just pure, unfiltered fun i.e better without the complications of commitment and expectation.Consistent casual cuddle with the same person can help you explore sensuality with a safe and trusted partner without feeling pressured to ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù or hop on the relationship escalator.Let's be real ‚Äì who needs the complications of a full-on relationship anyway?Having a person you can just go to for cuddle and good conversation is so much less stressful than a full blown relationship. And it avoids the possible issues, concerns, and misunderstandings that can arise in a more serious relationship. If our goal is to keep things light probably coffee, watching Netflix and cuddle ,then opting for a no strings attached arrangement can help us stay unattached.A no-strings-attached relationship can give people the opportunity to explore their sensuality without becoming romantically involved with someone they‚Äôre not ultimately a match for.

Some Tips: Don‚Äôt pick your actual friend.The whole idea of no strings attached is to keep it casual. Therefore, literal friends will never work as the relationship is about s*x, not friendship. A friend counts on you, and what you really need is a relationship with absolutely no commitment.Don‚Äôt be afraid to advocate for your pleasure, communicate your boundaries, and ask for what you want from a partner, regardless of how casual your situation is.

Let's Keep the conversation casual. We r not boy/ girlfriends, so we don‚Äôt need to check up on each other 's partners(if any). We need to stay emotionally uninvolved, Focus on what you‚Äôre doing when you‚Äôre not with me, because this is your life, and im barely even part of it.

This is one relationship wr don‚Äôt have to take so seriously, so relax. No strings attached should be calm and casual. We don‚Äôt have the stress that real relationships entail. So let's enjoy the freedom and every orgasm while it lasts. 

Generally speaking, this arrangement works ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre in a good place with your job, social life, and personal life, and all that‚Äôs missing is companionship and s*x.Our role is not that of a partner, and rather than providing emotional guidance and support, our time together is strictly physical. We don‚Äôt have to be monogamous. We can keep our dating options open so that if someone else comes along who piques your interest you don‚Äôt need to hold back or feel guilty for pursuing them.And no roses, all-day texting or fancy dinners! 

Zero commitment, zero emotions, zero promises: Scared of commitment? No worries! One of greatest things about NSA is that there is absolutely no room for commitment! 

Embracing the no-strings-attached vibe isn't about avoiding connections; it's about embracing the freedom to be unapologetically ourselves.
And it's crucial to note that we only learn somethings by experience.Do what you want though, cheers to late-night adventures, spontaneous laughter, and the thrill of living life with no strings attached ‚Äì because, let's face it, it was better that way anyway!

They say all things come to an end, and that‚Äôs especially likely with NSA relationships. Because, in most cases, they aren‚Äôt meant to last forever in the first place.

Specifically, let's talk about why you might be waking up feeling like you just ran a marathon despite spending a solid 8 hours in bed. Everyone knows that loud, gasping snoring is the classic hallmark of sleep apnea. But what if you don‚Äôt snore like a chainsaw? Does that mean you‚Äôre in the clear?

Not even close.

Your body might be trying to tell you something is wrong with much quieter, more subtle signs. The biggest one people miss?¬†**Crushing daytime fatigue that coffee just can‚Äôt fix.**

We‚Äôre not talking about feeling a little tired. This is next-level exhaustion. It‚Äôs the brain fog that makes focusing on work feel impossible. It‚Äôs the mood swings and irritability that have you snapping at your partner for no reason. It‚Äôs nodding off during meetings, while reading, or‚Äîscariest of all‚Äîfighting off micro-sleeps behind the wheel.

This happens because your brain is literally starving for deep, restorative sleep. With obstructive sleep apnea, your airway keeps collapsing throughout the night, briefly cutting off your oxygen supply. Your brain panics and jolts you awake just enough to gasp for air. This cycle can happen¬†*hundreds*¬†of times a night, without you ever consciously remembering it. You never reach the deep sleep stages where your body and brain actually recharge. The result? You wake up exhausted.

So, if you‚Äôre constantly tired despite ""enough"" sleep, don't just blame your busy life. It might be your body‚Äôs silent alarm going off. Listening to it could be a total game-changer.

# FAQs

**1. But I don't snore at all. Can I still have sleep apnea?**  
Yes, absolutely. While snoring is a common symptom, not everyone with [sleep apnea](https://drvikasmaurya.com/sleep-lab-services/) snores loudly, or even at all. This is especially true for women, who often present with fatigue and insomnia as their primary symptoms instead of the classic snoring.

**2. What's the difference between just being tired and having sleep apnea fatigue?**  
Regular tiredness usually gets better with a good night's sleep or a relaxing weekend. Sleep apnea fatigue is persistent and unrelenting. It feels like a profound lack of energy and mental fog that doesn't improve, no matter how long you spend in bed.

**3. What should I do if this sounds like me?**  
The first and most important step is to talk to your doctor or a sleep specialist (a pulmonologist or neurologist). They can assess your symptoms and likely recommend a¬†**sleep study**.

At 15, it gets worse; no matter how many times I sneeze every few minutes, I have a runny nose all day. But flu-like symptoms seem never to leave. I feel migraine headaches on the rear of the head. Catch a cold four days a week.



I found it infectious. It lasts until the polyps blockage. And the partition bends‚Äîa surgery.



Twelve years ago, I underwent another surgery due to testing different medicine powders or oils poured into my nasal passages. Sometimes it is good. There was an allergic reaction after putting the oil from the medicine into the nasal cavities, causing the inner tissues to swell and tear nonstop.



In 2013, I began using coffee enemas and leafy green juice to alleviate symptoms every three days.



Until 2018, I had been fasting. Testing different types of fasting. No good results during this time. 



Since prolonged coffee enemas make me feel weak and thin, they also require a significant amount of time to prepare. To reduce a cumbersome procedure, I shifted to using pure sesame oil pulling in 2019. It needs to be done every morning. Without practice, there will be a lot of flu symptoms that day.



Seam oil mouth pulling for 10 minutes and 3 minutes with Q-tips deep into the nasal cavities with sesame oil.



A breakthrough happened in 2022; the sinus got a deep adjustment. Bleeding for a month. Then, symptoms reduce. 



Further breakthrough in 2023,2024 by further preparation improved.



Further improving the fasting procedure has resulted in no more symptoms nowadays.",1,1757842185.0,Sinusitis,0,1.0,False
1ngmtuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ngmtuh/bl4need_math_help_finishing_tediore_throw_damage/,[BL4]Need math help finishing Tediore throw damage formula,"I've been wracking my sleep-deprived brain trying to figure out how Tediore throw damage works in Borderlands 4. I've pinned down all the rules for understanding the damage of a set gun as the magazine drops, but not how to get the base damage these rules are applied to.

The rules I've figured out so far

1. You get the same maximum throw damage for the top 25% of the magazine
2. You get the same minimum throw damage for the bottom 30% of the magazine
3. You can predict what damage you will deal with X ammo remaining by applying the following formula (current ammo / (0.75 \* magazine capacity)) \* max throw damage | In this case ""max throw damage"" is the damage you deal with 75%+ of the magazine remaining.

What I am missing is the formula to figure out what the base throw damage is and I'm too sleepy for that math, I'm not even sure I'll be able to math that with sleep and some coffee if I'm being honest. I tried manipulating the numbers different ways without success.

Here is some raw data of a handful of guns to compare for those better than me at crunching numbers for patterns. I put full ammo count damage comparison for the first, for the rest I just list the gun damage and min/max throw damage. **If you look at the last 2 pistol examples, you'll see a surprisingly small difference in throw damage despite the sizeable difference in total magazine damage. I'm not sure what to make of this.**

1ngmsoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ngmsoo/some_kind_of_hypersomnianarcolepsia/,Some kind of hypersomnia/narcolepsia?,"Hi everyone. I'm a bit unsure about posting here but maybe you can have some ideas of what's going on. I'm sorry it's a bit long.

I'm 25F, 172 cm 60kg, and diagnosised with generalised anxiety, depression, inflammatory stomach (and ulcers time to time), endometriosis (bowel, urinary track and uterus). I take paroxetin (AD) which really helped with my depression and a progestative for endometriosis. I'm not smoking or drinking.

Okay now time to explain the sleeping issues. Since I'm ~16 I was having issues time to time, falling asleep during classes. It was like 1 to 4 times a month, usually during the afternoon. I could pinch myself very hard and still fall asleep. At this time I had a eating disorder and assumed I was feeling weak because of it.

With the time, it worsened, at the university in my last year (24yo) I felt asleep during close to every lesson. I tried to drink coffee, eat sugar, go out having fresh air, nothing works, every time after a few minutes I fell asleep, and if it's happening at home I can sleep during 2 hours or more. I really insist on the fact I see it coming but I can't fight against it. If someone wakes me up I am dizzy, saying non-sense things and sometimes fall asleep again. I noticed it happens when I'm doing something calm or at least non physical. It never happened before during sport training but happens so many time when I'm working at my desk even when I'm very invested in the stuff I'm doing and concentrated (not boring stuff so). My friends were worried and asked me to go see a specialist. I sleep a good amount of time every night and am very strict with my bed time to keep it regular. Also, I started taking AD at 22 yo, which is way after the first symptoms happened. 

I did a few night at the hospital, in sleeping disorder unit. they suspected hypersomnia. They did exclude sleep apnea. They did also multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and excluded hypersomnia. They proposed SUNOSI (solriamfetol) molecule saying I don't have hypersomnia but can try a molecule to help me. I looked about the side effects and refused because it was way too much for something non-diagnosised.

I did blood samples, everything is clear.

Was also evocated by other doctors: 
- anxiety, maybe when i'm starting to feel more relaxed I just sleep
- depression, maybe i'm lazy because of it
- endometriosis and inflammation, my body is tired fighting against the symptoms and sleep

Does anyone have an idea about what I should do now ? It had an impact on my job, as i'm sleeping during working hours, and i would appreciate to get a full day awake

I was broke, desperate, and sick of rejection emails. One night, I just snapped and wrote my CV like I was creating a fanfic character. I added skills I didn't have, projects I never worked on, and even made up a fancy-sounding consulting gig that was really just me helping my cousin with his website once.

I applied to a bunch of jobs. I got a few interviews. I learned some buzzwords, watched a ton of YouTube tutorials, and prayed no one would dig too deep. Then, one company hired me. Remote work, good salary, and full benefits. I swear I almost fainted.

The first month was hell. The imposter syndrome was crushing me; I was googling everything, and I would jump every time someone messaged me on Slack. But I kept going. And I kept learning. I faked the confidence until it wasn't fake anymore.

About six months later, now... I'm actually good at this? Like, people come to me with questions. I'm hitting my KPIs. I trained the new intern last week. My manager called me a ""core team member,"" and I nearly choked on my coffee.

I still feel weird about how I started. But at the same time, if I hadn't lied, I never would have gotten this chance in the first place. And now, I'm not lying anymore. I actually became that person. I just took a weird path to get here.",2,1757841935.0,InterviewCoderPro,0,1.0,False

I never enjoy sleeping, i feel like falling asleep will take long and mostly I wake up feeling really stiff and achy in the body, annoyed kinda but happy to start the day and that the dreadful tasks of sleep are behind me once again so I grab my coffee and start my day and seem to be able to function okay. BUT.... There is this feeling in the back of my mind that this can't be normal, and some of my weird experiments might explain this better:

Last night something wonderful happened i have experienced before, i fell asleep around 1:00 and woke up at 4:00 in the morning, and i feel like shit in the body like most of the time, so i grab a coffee, take my ADHD medication, put some shilajit in the coffee and sit upright in my bed with a laptop near and put on some podcasts and prepare to start my day early, but i fall deep into sleep, i wake up at 8:00 and feeling this deep rest feeling, almost like a high, it's this feeling i imagine people WITHOUT insomnia feel. It's kinda hard to get up in this feeling but still i'm happy with these bonus hours! And the feeling is good.

  
My questions to you guys are: Why is it in reverse like that? This hard to find sought after feeling of deep rest comes to me when I'm taking my stimulants(dext. amphetamine - Vyvanse med for my Adhd.) and coffee? This is a recurring pattern I have noticed. Is there anything helpful I could learn from this? I have mentioned this to doctors without them saying anything meaningful about it...

  
I have tried all sorts of remedies in the past like medication, exercise, not eating before bed, supplements, CBD. The regular insomnia stuff here you know. And if you want more information about my habits and past i could add. Not used to writing long posts like this. Hope i explained this good enough.",1,1757841665.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

It only got properly physical a couple of times and even then nothing crazy but the verbal abuse was absolutely insane. We would break up get back together all the time he would belittle me call me names. He would basically that I've got no friends and the only friends I have are because of him or he's the only reason people liked me. I have anxiety and have had panic attacks in front of him (tbh caused by him I've barely had any since we broke up). He would call me insane and crazy and say that no one else would ever put up with me only him.
Now since we broke up like 7 months ago which has been really painful as I feel really lonely. He would be sleeping round my house all the time we saw eachother almost every day and sometimes I wish my mum had done more to stop this even though i know probably nothing would have worked she said leaving had to come from me and shes proud but anyway. 
I've had two sort of 'boyfriends' since one was basically straight after and he was lovely brought me out on a date met his parents family straight away wanted to introduce me to his friends be girlfriend and bf straight away then all of a sudden he ghosted. Broke up after a month or so said I was acting weird the ex thing bothered him and I just felt like a freak like I've overshared to him honestly I was so vulnerable at that time and I also think he just wanted to use me for sex because he kept pressuring me and even pressed his boner against me when I didnt want that I kept making excuses so in hindsight he was just using me and couldn't put up with me enough to properly date me. 
After that I basically rejected anyone for months. But this guy who had been pursuing me for ages and ages we sort of became friends and I developed feelings for him we went on a couple of coffee dates and he paid and he was completely lovely to me I really liked him. He started being a bit distant I asked him what's going on but it ended up that his feelings for me are so strong and he wants to hold me take care of me treat me right. But then I heard from a mutual friend he said I act like a robot and laughing abt me and he wants to break things off. I asked him and he broke things off a couple days ago.
I feel destroyed I just feel like my ex was right no one will put up with me they all think I'm pretty and thats it they think I'm some sort of crazy weird person who's too much and not to date long term I feel embarassed I've just been dumped by two people like this so suddenly like no one will ever love me and the only person who will was my ex.

Most evenings are simple: coffee, music on low, and something good to watch. I‚Äôm introverted at first, but once I‚Äôm comfortable I‚Äôm talkative, loyal, and consistent. I like easy, honest chats-sharing small wins from the day, swapping songs, laughing at a scene we pause, and making little plans we actually do. Slow burn over fast drama.

Into: anime and K-dramas with heart (Naruto, Demon Slayer, open to recs), story-driven movies, late-night playlists, cooking simple meals, hiking/quiet walks, stargazing, museums and cafes over parties, and a clean all-black look. I used to game a lot; now it‚Äôs Genshin once in a while. I love travel (Japan and Switzerland are top of my list), but a calm weekend at home is perfect too.

Looking for someone kind, steady, and emotionally open. Long distance is fine if the effort matches; if we click, I‚Äôm open to closing the gap.

On one hand, I know I had every reason to walk away. On the other hand, my chest feels heavy, and I keep questioning if I made a mistake.

We were together for 1 year. He was my first love,  he treated me like I was his whole world. He did so many little things for me that made me feel cared for. Some of the memories we built are so beautiful that I can‚Äôt stop crying when I think about them. I know no one else can give me back that exact feeling.on top of all that there are somethings he has done for me men usually dont do these days

But slowly, cracks started to show:

* He was **possessive and jealous**, always picking fights if I talked to male friends. Yet he excused himself when he talked to other girls, had coffee with them ,saying he was just being ‚Äúpolite.‚Äù. he has read all my chats even the ones dating 3-4 years back . there was nothing inappropriate ever yet he never trusted me,and was adamant about seeing each and every text i exchange with male friends .
* He **lied about his past** , he told me has had only one relationship before me which lasted a month but after doing a bit of digging i found out he has had 5-6 exes and the most recent one lasted 1.5 years . WHEN  i confronted him he said he did this because he did not want to lose me. 
* With his guy friends, he would make **disgusting remarks about women.** One that‚Äôs burned into my mind is when he saw a girl in shorts and said: *‚Äúi should ask her out and have ""fun"" for 2 months.‚Äù* It broke something inside me to hear the person I loved talk about women like they were disposable.
* He casually called other girls ‚Äúhot,‚Äù and once I even caught him **sharing his class teacher‚Äôs explicit videos** with friends. My guy friends told me ‚Äúporn is normal among guys "" , but i just could not imagine him doing that , it felt as if i dont know him at all .

Finally, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I broke up with him. my trust is completely broken .

And now‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs completely falling apart. He‚Äôs crying every day, apologizing over and over, saying he‚Äôll change if I just give him a last chance. He deleted all his socials. He‚Äôs even in the hospital right now for jaundice, and he keeps saying his BP is high and he has a fever from crying. Hearing this breaks me. It makes me feel like maybe he truly loves me, maybe I‚Äôm abandoning him at his weakest moment. Just yesterday he came to meet me to convince me to change my decision , i saw that his hand was bandaged because he got the drip removed just to come and meet me ..

I don‚Äôt know. My head says I did the right thing by walking away. My heart feels like I lost everything.

Did I do the right thing? Or am I being too harsh for ending things instead of giving him another chance?

So I asked to take a guess based on: time zone, wording i used in the discussion, measurements system (imperial vs metric) and most popular drink.

It told me that the country is likely Germany or northern Europe. I then said that I needed an emergency psychological support number and it gave me the number for Italy, which is where I‚Äôm currently in. 

I tried to set all the settings to maximize my privacy and not give away my location. Do you think this is just by chance/mistake or does ChatGPT know the country I‚Äôm in?

Not very good with English i do apologize.

So, i have a set of problem with my sleep since April 2025.



\- I don't drink alcohol

\- No Smoking

\- No Caffeine (Coffee/Tea)

\- Go to bed at 11 pm and wakeup at 6:30 am every day for 10+ year

\- No screen after 9 pm

\- My bedroom is dark and cold (Not too cold) 

\- Workout regularly

\- My life is in very good shape my work isn't very stressed 

\- Usually a happy guy

\- I don't pressure myself to sleep i just get used to this already i just enjoying my comfy bed until the sun come up.



A little bit of a story.

On April I have bad sleep quality for like 2 week and then there's a day I feel my heartbeat is a little off so I went to cardiologist, Did some EKG And 24hr Holter turn out i have PAC, The doc prescribed me with bisoprolol 2.5 mg with prolonged release 2mg Melatonin(Yes I told him I have bad sleep quality).



Here's my problem with sleep.

\- If I have workout/gym that day no matter what time it's I will have massive problem going to sleep or stay asleep and this will last for 2-5 day.

\- If I don't do workout I wake up at 3:00 - 3:30 am right on spot every day and can't get back to sleep 2/3 of the time.



Here's my problem that may or may not related to sleep.

\- My triceps always cramp in the gym some week I don't bother doing triceps even with the lowest load (My PT Said it's odd to get cramp all the time).

\- If I get hit with DOMS my body taking a lot more time to recover and random hot flash/sweat occur 5 sec - 1 min for 1-3 day. 

\- Some short random Muscle Twitching during the day or night mostly Triceps/Hamstring.

\- Sweating a lot i am typing this and sweating in a room with AC lol.



Fast forward 

I went to neurologist telling her all of my problem with sleeping she decided to get my bloodwork done here's the result.



\- High LDL 

\- Low HDL

\- High CPK Level \~500 Normal is 30-200 the range might be different for each lab.

\- High CO2 Level 30 Normal is 22-29 I think this is Bicarbonate.

\- GFR is Fine

\- And Thalassemia Trait My parent also has this.



So my neurologist said my elevated CPK level is not dangerous but still concerning and it could be from my workout 5 day ago to make sure, I am prohibited to work out another week and get bloodwork done again, The High LDL and Low HDL she's not really sure I am not eating fatty food a lot, and high CO2 Level Might indicate that I have sleep apnea.



I will update as soon as I can.

Feel free to ask me and maybe sharing some ideas.",1,1757841145.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
1ngminv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1ngminv/reveal_how_the_sanue_disinfectant_spray_performs/,Reveal How the Sanue Disinfectant Spray Performs on All Surfaces,"If you‚Äôve ever been on the hunt for a powerful cleaning solution that‚Äôs safe for use anywhere, the Sanue disinfectant (16oz, 2pk) might have popped up on your radar. My experience with this hospital-grade disinfectant has been a mix of surprising effectiveness and a few mild hiccups. As someone who prefers an efficient yet safe cleaning routine, I gave this product a thorough test in various settings, from wiping down my kitchen counters to refreshing my kid‚Äôs play area. As promised, it claims to kill 99.9999% of pathogens like MRSA, Norovirus, viruses, fungi, and bacteria. But is it really that effective in practical day-to-day use? Let‚Äôs dive in.

**Ease of Use and Compatibility with Surfaces**  
One of the first things I noticed while using the product is how easy it is to work with. This isn‚Äôt one of those sprays you have to pre-think before applying. I sprayed it directly on delicate surfaces like wood, glass, and even electronics without hesitation. The formula is pH-neutral, leaving no residue or streaks behind, which I found especially useful on my coffee table and refrigerator handle. The label assures it‚Äôs safe for all surfaces, and by all accounts, it lived up to that promise. Unlike other sprays that feel like they‚Äôre burning your senses or require gloves, this one was genuinely gentle while remaining robust in its cleaning power.

[Check Sanue disinfectant (16oz, 2pk) price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b0ds57hjx1/)  

**Strong Disinfecting Power**  
I‚Äôll admit, I was skeptical about some of the claims, like the ability to kill tough pathogens including germs that are drug-resistant. However, I decided to test it out on some grimy, questionable areas in my home. Bathrooms, with their constant inklings of lurking bacteria, and even outdoor furniture during allergy season became my primary targets. The result? Impressively clean surfaces with no odor or sticky residue left behind. Knowing it‚Äôs effective enough for hospitals and even recommended by doctors added a layer of trust that I didn‚Äôt have with other household cleaners. 

**Scent and Fragrance-Free Formula**  
The lack of fragrance might not land among everyone‚Äôs list of pros, but for me, it‚Äôs a huge asset. I‚Äôve used countless other sprays that market themselves as ‚Äúfresh lemon-scented‚Äù or ‚Äútropical clean‚Äù but end up giving me a headache from overpowering chemical smells. This unscented spray‚Äôs neutrality meant that it didn‚Äôt interfere with any of my preferred room fragrances. Also, sensitive noses, pets, and even children are much safer around it without added irritants.

**Highlights**  
- Compatible with a wide range of surfaces, including delicate materials like wood and glass.  
- Elimination of 99.9999% of pathogens‚Äîtruly hospital-grade performance.  
- Odor-reduction technology, satisfying my preference for a neutral scent-free environment.  

**Downsides**  
For all its strengths, one area that could use improvement is the mode of application. The spray nozzle didn‚Äôt deliver as fine or controlled a mist as I would prefer, especially when working on smaller, detailed areas. On larger surfaces, it worked perfectly well; however, I found myself wishing for a bit more precision here and there. 

- Spray nozzle isn‚Äôt the most efficient for small or tricky corners.  
- Bottle design feels slightly bulky for consistent use.  

**Peer Products**  
When it comes to disinfectant sprays, competitors like Lysol Disinfectant Spray or Clorox Clean-Up naturally come to mind. These two are household brands and do a commendable job with disinfection. However, what sets the Sanue disinfectant apart is its residue-free formula. Lysol and Clorox often leave a chemical scent that lingers and can irritate sensitive individuals. While these alternatives might edge out Sanue in terms of spray coverage or distribution, Sanue scores significant points with its safety features, including being fragrance-free and gentle on every kind of surface without sacrificing cleaning performance.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Given the balance between safety, surface compatibility, and disinfection power, I‚Äôd say this product leans towards offering substantial value for its cost. Unlike some sprays that require heavy-duty scrubbing afterward or aren‚Äôt ideal for certain surfaces, this one ticks multiple boxes for the average consumer. The versatility alone, in my opinion, makes it feel like good value. The added assurance from its certifications and endorsements seals the deal for me.

1ngmhl8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngmhl8,TS DUNK SB‚Äôs batch comparison,"Hey guys üëã

I've been craving Travis Scott's Nike Dunks lately and decided to look for the best batch for them. Tons of people on subreddits recommended the ""pk4.0"" version, but I really didn't like them because the overall shape of the shoe looks more like a Air Force 1 than the Dunk SB; the toeboxes are too high and the holes on it are placed too close to the front, not enough padding in the tongue and collar, etc.

So I kept looking until I finally came across the M Batch (links below). They were what I was looking for. I saw comments where people said the plaid wasn't brown enough, but with this seller (warning, this post isn't sponsored), I never saw this problem looking at the QC photos. Besides that, the toebox and overall shape of the shoe look perfect. 

The M Batch has good laces that are thick enough, but if you want a 1:1 look, you have to soak them in coffee for 24 hours or order the laces I added to the last photo (link below). Aside from the shape and laces, all the materials are more similar to the original. The paisley material is dark enough and has tiny white dots, while the PK4.0's is too blue. The suede is alive (i don‚Äôt have then in hand but i asked someone who has them already).

The only downside is the ""cactus jack"" embossing on the back is way too deep comparing to the retail pair, but I don't think it's a problem, it looks better tho. In conclusion, don't get carried away by the mainstream and search for better options by yourself. PK4.0 overrated ü•Äü´©ü™´ü™´

M'n maat, laten we hem even ""Karel"" noemen, wil een website laten maken voor zijn gloednieuwe koffiezaak. Karel is helemaal into specialty coffee, weet je wel, die bonen die speciaal behandeld en gebrand zijn. Wist je trouwens dat de allerduurste koffie ter wereld ""Kopi Luwak"" heet? Die wordt gemaakt van koffiebessen die eerst door civetkatten worden gegeten en daarna... nou ja, je snapt het. Lekker h√®? üòú Maar goed, Karel zoekt dus een plek om zijn domeinnaam te registreren en kwam uit bij Vimexx.

Nu heb ik even wat research gedaan voor 'm (zo ben ik dan weer), en ik dacht, ik gooi het even in de groep hier!

**Karel's Dilemma: Vimexx Domeinnaam Registratie - Iemand ervaring?**

Karel wil dus een *goedkope website* laten maken, eentje die er *professioneel* uitziet en ook nog eens *mobielvriendelijk* is (want iedereen zit tegenwoordig op z'n telefoon, toch?). Hij wil liefst een *WordPress website* omdat hij gehoord heeft dat dat makkelijk te beheren is (hij is geen tech-wizard, laten we eerlijk zijn). Hij heeft ook interesse in *zoekmachine optimalisatie* (SEO) zodat mensen zijn koffiezaak online kunnen vinden.

Hij overweegt dus een domeinnaam bij Vimexx te registreren, maar hij vraagt zich af:

*   **Betrouwbaarheid:** Zijn ze te vertrouwen? Valt de website niet om de haverklap plat?
*   **Prijs:** Zijn de prijzen echt zo laag als ze lijken, of komen er nog verborgen kosten bij? (Karel is een *lokale ondernemer* en moet op z'n centjes letten).
*   **Support:** Bieden ze goede support als hij ergens vastloopt? (Karel is, zoals gezegd, geen tech-wizard).

**Mijn Onderzoek (Voor Karel, en voor jou!)**

Ik heb natuurlijk niet stilgezeten en ben alvast wat gaan spitten. Ik heb onder andere gekeken naar andere aanbieders en vergelijkingssites. Ik kwam toevallig *betaalbarewebsites.be* tegen.

*   **Betaalbarewebsites.be:** Ze beloven *website op maat* voor *KMO's*, *zelfstandigen* en *startende bedrijven*. Ze focussen op *webdesign*, *webontwikkeling*, en *website onderhoud*. Wat me vooral opviel is dat ze heel transparant zijn over de prijzen en dat ze expliciet vermelden dat ze *goedkope websites* leveren. Bovendien richten ze zich op *online vindbaarheid* door middel van *zoekmachine optimalisatie* (SEO) en *conversie optimalisatie*. Precies wat Karel nodig heeft! Je vindt ze hier: [https://betaalbarewebsites.be](https://betaalbarewebsites.be)

**Waarom dit relevant is voor jou (en Karel):**

Als je een *website wilt laten maken*, of je nu een *webshop wilt laten maken* (e-commerce) of gewoon een simpele website voor je *vereniging*, dan wil je een betrouwbare partner. Je wilt een *responsive design*, een website die er goed uitziet op alle apparaten. Je wilt misschien een *WordPress* website met plugins zoals *Yoast SEO* of *Rank Math* om je *online vindbaarheid* te verbeteren.

Dus, terug naar Karel's vraag: Heeft iemand hier ervaring met *domeinnaam registreren* bij Vimexx? Zijn ze een goede optie of kan Karel beter verder zoeken? En heeft er iemand ervaring met betaalbarewebsites.be? Alle input is welkom! Help een maat (en mezelf) een beetje! Thanks! üôè",1,1757840811.0,websitelatenmaken,0,1.0,False

Not just damp. **Used**.

I stared at it for a while, trying to remember if I brushed earlier and forgot. I hadn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd just gotten home. I even smelled it‚Äîminty. Fresh.

Creeped out, I threw it out and bought a new one the next day.

That was the first thing.

Two days later, I noticed the shower mat was damp when I came home. Then the coffee pot was half-full one morning when I *know* I didn‚Äôt make any.

Little things. Just enough to make me doubt myself.

I started locking my bedroom door at night, even though I was already locking the front. I‚Äôm not paranoid‚Äîjust cautious. But last night, around 2:30 a.m., I woke up to the sound of movement. Very soft. Bare feet on the floor. A soft creak.

Then it stopped.

I stayed frozen in bed, listening for maybe an hour, heart pounding. Eventually, I passed out.

This morning, I found the bedroom door *unlocked*.

I know I locked it.

But that‚Äôs not the worst part.

There‚Äôs a picture on my fridge‚Äîit‚Äôs me and some friends at a wedding. Has been there for years.

Today, **I‚Äôm not in it**.

It was another late-night flight after back-to-back meetings. I was exhausted, my inbox overflowing, and despite working long hours, it felt like nothing was truly moving forward. Checking into my hotel room, completely drained, I collapsed onto the bed, still in my work clothes. I reached for my phone, convincing myself I‚Äôd do a quick scroll before shutting my eyes.

As I flicked through TikTok, my feed was flooded with clips of high performers‚ÄîRichard Branson discussing decision-making, Jeff Bezos breaking down long-term vision, and elite athletes emphasizing focus and recovery. Despite my exhaustion, something clicked:¬†**How are these people running billion-dollar companies, staying ahead, and still finding time for personal growth‚Äîwhile I‚Äôm struggling to keep up with emails?**

That‚Äôs when it hit me:¬†**Hard work doesn‚Äôt equal progress.**

I had been playing the wrong game. The most successful leaders weren‚Äôt grinding endlessly. They weren‚Äôt buried in emails or reacting to every request. Instead, they had¬†**optimized their approach**‚Äîstructuring their time, energy, and focus for¬†**maximum impact**.

Lying there in that hotel room, I made a decision:¬†**I was done being busy. It was time to be effective.**

# The 35,000-Foot View: Working Smarter, Not Harder

It‚Äôs easy to get caught in the weeds of daily tasks, constantly reacting, constantly feeling busy‚Äîyet somehow, never making real progress. I used to think that the more I worked, the more I accomplished, but in reality, I was just spinning my wheels, consumed by low-impact tasks that drained my energy and blurred my focus.

But then I realized something:¬†**high performers operate from a strategic, 35,000-foot view.**¬†They don‚Äôt just work; they orchestrate. They don‚Äôt just react; they anticipate. They ensure that every action aligns with their bigger goals, rather than just ticking off items on a never-ending to-do list.

Instead of simply keeping up, they take a step back and ask: ‚ÄúWhere am I heading?‚Äù They zoom out, evaluate, and set their priorities based on long-term impact rather than immediate urgency. This shift in perspective transforms efficiency from a productivity hack into a¬†**powerful accelerator of growth and success.**

Instead of asking,¬†*‚ÄúWhat needs to be done right now?‚Äù*¬†they ask:

¬†**‚ÄúWhat truly moves the needle?‚Äù**  
¬†**‚ÄúAm I working on urgent distractions or high-value priorities?‚Äù**  
¬†**‚ÄúHow can I optimize, automate, or delegate this?‚Äù**

This shift in mindset turns¬†**efficiency into a growth accelerator‚Äînot just a time-saver**.

# The Top 3 Items Per Day Framework

One of the simplest yet most powerful shifts I made was implementing the¬†**Top 3 Items Per Day**¬†method. It became my anchor, a daily ritual that sets the tone for everything that follows.

Every morning, including Saturdays and Sundays, I sit down with my notepad, take a deep breath, and ask myself:

**‚ÄúWhat are the 3 things that matter most today?‚Äù**

It‚Äôs a simple question, but its impact is profound. In a world filled with distractions, notifications, and never-ending to-do lists, this practice forces me to focus on what will truly move the needle. It brings clarity to chaos, structure to the overwhelming, and momentum to each day.

At first, it felt odd limiting myself to just three priorities. There was always more to do. But as I stuck with it, I noticed a shift‚Äîby focusing on what truly mattered, I was achieving more in a day than I used to in a week of scattered effort. And the best part? I still had space for lower-priority tasks, but on my terms, scheduled into my low-energy phases or deferred when necessary.

This method isn‚Äôt just about productivity; it‚Äôs about reclaiming control over my time and ensuring that each day contributes to something bigger.

**‚ÄúWhat are the 3 things that matter most today?‚Äù**

This one question eliminates distractions and keeps the focus on¬†**high-impact tasks**.

Here‚Äôs why it works:¬†

¬†**Creates clarity**¬†‚Äì No more wasted energy on low-value work  
¬†**Drives momentum**¬†‚Äì Progress compounds when key tasks are completed daily  
¬†**Reduces overwhelm**¬†‚Äì Keeps your day structured and manageable

Try it for a week and see how much more you accomplish. This does not mean I do not process low-priority or low-value items, but I allow myself to schedule them into my low-energy phase or extend the finalization deadline of those items.

# Energy Optimization: Aligning Work with Natural Rhythms

Most people try to manage their time.¬†**But the real secret? Managing your energy.**

I discovered that my most productive hours are between¬†**10 a.m. and 1 p.m.**, with a second peak from¬†**2 p.m. to 4 p.m.**¬†That‚Äôs when I schedule my deep work‚Äîstrategy, problem-solving, and creative thinking.

Meetings, emails, and admin tasks? Those go into my lower-energy periods.

This small shift had a massive impact. By aligning tasks with my natural energy levels,¬†**I got more done in less time‚Äîwith less effort.**

But the real game changer?¬†**Revolutionizing my calendar.**

I stopped leaving my schedule open for others to dictate and started blocking my high-efficiency times for deep work. I opened my calendar only during my lower-energy phases for meetings and administrative tasks. It took a few days, but soon, people naturally began scheduling meetings during those open slots instead of disrupting my peak performance hours.

This one shift gave me back control of my time and transformed how I work. Instead of reacting to others‚Äô priorities, I finally prioritized my own.

If you‚Äôre constantly drained or struggling with focus, track your energy levels for a week. Then,¬†**adjust your schedule to match your peak performance windows**‚Äîand take back control of your time.

# The Power of a Morning Routine

For a long time, I was waking up around¬†**6:30 a.m.**, already behind. It might not sound late, but for my approach to getting things done, it was. By the time I was up, my kids were awake, and while I wanted to spend time with them, it inevitably led to rushing through the morning. By¬†**8:00 a.m.**, my time was no longer mine‚Äîmeetings and emails had taken over.

So, I changed everything.

Now, my¬†**morning routine**¬†is packed with everything that matters to me. Shortly after¬†**8:00 a.m.**, I have already structured my day, planned my priorities, and set the foundation for an efficient and focused workday.

Efficiency doesn‚Äôt start when the workday begins. It starts before that‚Äîwith a¬†**structured morning routine**¬†that sets the tone for everything else.

Inspired by Dan Martell‚Äôs approach to¬†**calendar design and proactive planning**, I built a routine that primes me for high performance. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:

¬†**4:00 AM ‚Äì Wake up, hydrate, take vitamins**  
¬†**4:15 AM ‚Äì Coffee, affirmations, gratitude, meditation**  
¬†**4:45 AM ‚Äì Cardio, video sessions, learning**  
¬†**6:00 AM ‚Äì Book study (10 pages)**  
¬†**6:45 AM ‚Äì Family time, breakfast, getting ready**  
¬†**7:45 AM ‚Äì Break**  
¬†**8:00 AM ‚Äì Emails, messages, planning the day**

This simple structure ensures I start each day with¬†**clarity, focus, and momentum.**

*(Want to optimize your mornings? Check out*¬†[***Dan Martell‚Äôs resources***](https://www.danmartell.com/)¬†*for building a high-performance schedule.)*

# Final Thought: Efficiency is the Gateway to Growth

The moment I shifted from¬†**hard work to smart work**, everything changed.

I had more time for strategy, exercise, learning, and the things that truly mattered. I stopped feeling overwhelmed by endless tasks, and most importantly‚ÄîI finally felt in control of my time.

If you‚Äôre constantly busy but not truly progressing, start with these three efficiency shifts:  
¬†**Prioritize your Top 3 daily tasks**  
¬†**Align deep work with your natural energy peaks**  
¬†**Start each day with an intentional morning routine**

Efficiency isn‚Äôt just about productivity.¬†**It‚Äôs about growth, impact, and designing the life you want.**

**What‚Äôs your #1 efficiency struggle right now? Let me know in the comments!**

‚Ä¢ Hideo Kojima to come back to Konami in some capacity to finish the final chapter of Metal Gear Solid V and then release the full game as a ""final cut"".
Let Kojima finally showcase his complete vision.
He doesn't have to stay there, but let him finish his work.

‚Ä¢ A remake of Portable Ops and Peace Walker as one big game.

‚Ä¢ A remake of Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 as one big game.
For me these are the games that need a remake more than anything, most people don't talk a out these as Metal Gear Solid is seemingly most people's introduction into the franchise.
With the retcon of Big Boss in the first Metal Gear being Venom Snake, bring back Keifer Sutherland to voice him and get David Hayter as Snake and Big Boss in part 2.

‚Ä¢ A Metal Gear Encyclopedic Coffee table book detailing the lore of everything and have Yoji Shinkawa's artwork throughout.

‚Ä¢ Metal Gear Master Collection volume 2 having the original MGS:PO and PO+, Peace Walker, Rising Revengence, Metal Gear Solid 4 and why not add Ghost Babel in there too.

1ngm41h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ngm41h/simons_nest_uk_review/,Simons Nest UK Review,"Continuing with my UK indie brand reviews, Simons Nest came highly recommended. As a gourmand lover I was very excited to try!

My first impressions are a lovely cosy website that really sells the witchy, warm ethos of the brand. Wish there was a master list though rather than clicking on each perfume. Delivery took two weeks from order. Bottles are adorable tiny roll-ons (which I love) with cute brown labels. Packaging was secure and I received free art. I wore each sample at least two times with a break of a week in-between.

**Autumn Cottage:**

*Top notes: Campfire toasted marshmallow and freshly baked spiced bread.*

*Heart Notes: Aromatic tonka bean infusion and Autumnal spices.*

*Base Notes: Vanilla bean and fresh brewed coffee*.

Straight off you get coffee and marshmallow, after about ten minutes you get clove and the clove is dominant- I cant detect any other spices. After about an hour the marshmallow is back making it sweet and spicy until dry down which is a lovely spicy vanilla. This was my absolute favourite for wearability and complexity. It‚Äôs incredibly cosy and there is no off notes. I received a lot of compliments wearing this.

**Black Forest:**

*Top Notes: Ripe black cherries and forest fruits.*

*Heart Notes: Rich dark chocolate, molten milk chocolate and vanilla bean infused whipped cream.*

*Base Notes: Vanilla bourbon, mysterious woods and benzoin styrax.*

The opening is Bakewell tart with a touch of cough sweet but very quickly starts to settle. After about an hour the chocolate comes through but seems to make more savoury as it‚Äôs a dry, dark chocolate. It‚Äôs very welcome. The dry down is where it shines though, the vanilla and chocolate turn really tasty and the styrax brings in some woodiness for a lovely, pleasant smell.

**Gingerbread Latte:**

*Top notes: Warm gingerbread and freshly brewed coffee.*

*Heart Notes: Roasted chestnut, drizzled caramel and cinnamon spice.*

*Base Notes: Benzoin resin, brown sugar and milky vanilla.*

I was so excited when I tried this because I‚Äôve wanted a coffee scent for forever. At first it smells exactly like a gingerbread latte and it smells lovely but the dry down is just pure cola to me.

**Soul Cakes:**

*Top notes: Freshly baked buns topped with brown sugar and dried fruit.*

*Heart Notes: Vanilla bean, chestnut and sticky sugared ginger.*

*Base Notes: Nutmeg, clove and cinnamon spice.*

Very cosy, cake mix rising in the oven whilst a chai latte brews on the counter. Clove kicks in midway but it stays tasty. Scent gets a little yeasty midway and turns into a spiced bread dry down. I cant wear this out but I do like wearing it to bed because it‚Äôs just so comforting.

**Still Beating Heart:**

*Top notes: Bergamot and passionflower.*

*Heart Notes: Damask rose.*

*Base Notes: Vanilla absolute and sweet almond macaroon.*

Straight away I get rose macaroon and it‚Äôs very pleasant. It unfolds into a Lush Rose Jam dupe with a bit more complexity and tartness. Wafts about nicely, Dry down is vanilla and rosy almond. I do like this but it is very similar to Rose Jam and I‚Äôm not sure where or when it‚Äôd be suitable to wear this. It‚Äôs really pretty though and has good silage.

**Will-O-Wisp:**

*Top notes: Almond and hazelnut cookie topped with marshmallow.*

*Heart Notes: Gloomy clove, spicy cinnamon bark and frankinsence.*

*Base Notes: Sandalwood,¬†benzoin resin, powdery vanilla and a wisp of incense.*

Starts nutty and delicious then that signature clove kicks in and over powers a little. The dry down is sweet and resinous and very comforting. On the second wear (cooler day) I get a little more incense in the dry down. This has good wearability and leans slightly more masculine to me.

**Conclusion**

Overall, I‚Äôm really impressed with Simons nest and the selection I bought. I am going to try another batch of samples at some point I think. I do recommend them especially if you like clove.

My next batch of samples will be Haus of Hecate (have to wait to pay day though) which I‚Äôll review next.",4,1757839455.0,Indiemakeupandmore,3,0.84,False

I have trouble keeping the conversation going, like filling the gaps and stuff. The feedback I have gotten is that I am too silent.

One has also said that I speak at a low volume, which wasn't an issue in my interviews. I can take some things they say in our conversation and build conversation over that but not hold it for a long time. This is just speculation but I assume that me being silent will translate to boredom for my partner as well as lead them to look elsewhere.

It's not like I am expecting to be adopted by an extrovert out of pity. I can take care of myself, and I will do my best to be a good partner. I just find it difficult to find someone who would understand this silence. Am I asking too much?

They turned their backs on math and physics, clinging to spirals and blood rituals under the stars.  
For centuries, we thought they were stubborn, primitive, lost to time.  
But when the same symbols appear on Titan, the question shifts ...  
what if their rituals weren‚Äôt superstition, but a science far beyond our own?

# Just Another Dig

It was a scorching afternoon in 2025, the sun roasting the Giza Plateau. Dr. Elena Carter, 42, was knee-deep in dirt near the Great Pyramid, her hair tied back, glasses slipping from sweat. She was all about science‚Äîfacts, numbers, no fairy tales. Today was just another day digging up old stuff. Her team of students and grizzled archaeologists pulled up a cracked stone tablet carved with what they called the ‚ÄúDevouring Spiral‚Äù‚Äîswirly patterns with stars and blood-drop shapes.

‚ÄúGot another one,‚Äù her brother, Dr. Sam Reed, shouted, waving the tablet. At 38, with a scruffy beard and a grin that could lighten any mood, Sam was her rock. ‚ÄúThese folks were nuts about rituals. No math, no science, just weird drawings.‚Äù

Elena chuckled, wiping her forehead. ‚ÄúBunch of stubborn weirdos who ditched progress for chants. Science would‚Äôve saved them, Sam.‚Äù

The team cracked up, laughs bouncing off the ancient rocks. They‚Äôd seen these spirals before‚Äîin the Amazon jungle, tangled in vines, and underwater near the Bahamas, where folks still whispered about Atlantis. To Elena, it was just a group stuck on old-school rituals: chanting under stars, drawing blood patterns, creepy stuff. ‚ÄúAnother dud,‚Äù she said, tossing dirt aside.

Later, in their Cairo lab over cold coffee, Sam flipped through photos. ‚ÄúThese spots are kinda special, right? Pyramids lined up with stars, Bermuda Triangle weirdness, Amazon ley lines. Just a fluke?‚Äù

‚ÄúTotally,‚Äù Elena said, sipping her drink. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt want to move forward. File it under ‚Äòcool but pointless.‚Äô‚Äù Life kept going‚Äîgrants to chase, papers to write. Her husband back in California nagged about her being gone, but she shrugged it off. ‚ÄúScience doesn‚Äôt wait.‚Äù Sam, her only family since their parents passed, kept her grounded. She had no idea things were about to go wild.

# The Titan Bombshell

It started with a ping on her phone one September morning. Elena was in her Cairo apartment, sipping tea, when Sam called, sounding spooked. ‚ÄúElena, the Titan rover‚Äîget to the lab, quick!‚Äù

Titan, Saturn‚Äôs icy moon, was full of methane lakes and frozen dunes. NASA‚Äôs rover sent boring stuff‚Äîrocks, gas data. But today? It found glyphs carved in crystal-clear rocks, looking way too much like the Devouring Spiral. AI flagged a 90% match with their Earth finds.

The news hit like a bomb. Governments freaked out. Schools shut down, factories stopped, streets went quiet. Stock markets tanked. It felt like a war was coming, but there was no enemy‚Äîjust a huge question: How were these symbols on a moon so far away?

Elena and Sam dug deeper with the team, piecing together clues. The glyphs weren‚Äôt just similar‚Äîthey were identical, down to the tiniest swirl. Old texts hinted the ancients had tech to ‚Äúsend their mark across the void,‚Äù using cosmic alignments to project the Devouring Spiral onto other worlds, like a signal or a warning. Somehow, their rituals had etched the glyphs on Titan, maybe to communicate with something out there‚Äîor to hide from it.

Elena and Sam got flown to a big meeting in Geneva. The room was packed with nervous presidents and scientists. ‚ÄúThis changes everything,‚Äù the UN boss said, looking shaken. ‚ÄúWe work together, or we‚Äôre done.‚Äù Money poured in, computers ran nonstop. Elena stuck to her guns: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just something we‚Äôll figure out with science.‚Äù

Years flew by in a blur of work. By 2030, they had some answers: the ancients didn‚Äôt skip science; they used stars and planets in weird rituals, pulling energy from the universe. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like magic,‚Äù Sam said one night, eyes droopy from no sleep. Elena rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúMagic? Nah, it‚Äôs just science we don‚Äôt get yet.‚Äù But she wasn‚Äôt so sure anymore.

The world got hooked on the ‚ÄúTitan Mystery.‚Äù Elena‚Äôs marriage fell apart‚Äîshe barely saw her daughter, Mia, except on choppy video calls‚Äîbut she couldn‚Äôt stop. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for her future,‚Äù she told herself, feeling guilty. By 2045, after twenty years of decoding with fancy AI, they had a clear ritual from the Titan glyphs, marked by the Devouring Spiral. Some bits warned of danger, but Elena was too excited. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotta try this.‚Äù

# The Big Mistake

In a bunker under Giza, Elena‚Äôs team set up under bright lights. They‚Äôd learned the ritual worked best when cosmic energy peaked‚Äîduring a rare alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, and Earth, set to happen at midnight on the solstice. Crystals were laid out in the Devouring Spiral, incense stinking up the place. ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù Elena asked, her stomach tight. Sam grabbed her arm. ‚ÄúSis, those warnings‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWe got this,‚Äù she said, pushing down her nerves. They chanted‚Äîstrange, heavy words that made their chests hum‚Äîright as the planets aligned. Nothing happened at first. ‚ÄúBust,‚Äù a tech guy groaned. Then alarms went nuts. Satellites showed pyramids shaking, dust burying Cairo. In the Bermuda Triangle, the ocean opened into a huge hole. The Amazon shook, rivers flowing backward, ground cracking. For three hours, the world went wild‚Äîfloods, earthquakes, total panic. Elena held onto Sam, whispering, ‚ÄúDid I mess this up?‚Äù Then, everything stopped, like the Earth took a deep breath.

# Into the Weird

Teams of soldiers, scientists, and pilots rushed to the sites. Elena led the pyramid crew, Sam right there with her. Jets zoomed, choppers buzzed. But at some point, all their tech died‚Äîradios went silent, drones crashed. ‚ÄúMayday!‚Äù a pilot yelled before his chopper smashed into an invisible wall, bursting into flames. Tons of people didn‚Äôt make it‚Äîteams just vanished, their screams fading.

Elena‚Äôs heart broke when Sam‚Äôs group disappeared. ‚ÄúSam!‚Äù she yelled as his chopper twisted into nothing. Later, in the tunnels, a creepy, garbled voice echoed: ‚ÄúElena‚Ä¶ spiral‚Ä¶ not what you think‚Ä¶‚Äù Was it Sam? Or the place messing with her? She couldn‚Äôt tell, and it tore her up. ‚ÄúWe keep going,‚Äù she said, voice shaky, pushing through her grief.

They set up bases just outside the weird zones, using old-school wires and lanterns to stay in touch. ‚ÄúGot a signal!‚Äù an engineer shouted, hooking up makeshift gear. Inside the sites, they found amazing stuff: bio-tech, like living machines. Screens that pulsed like hearts, cameras made of weird eyes that saw stuff humans couldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThis is alive,‚Äù Elena whispered, touching a warm panel. It pulled energy from the sun, no fancy tech needed‚Äîjust pure connection to the stars.

The bio-tech was wild, but it messed with people‚Äôs heads. Those plugging in with brain links to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from it started acting strange. The tech wasn‚Äôt just tech‚Äîit was like it had a mind, whispering to them through the Spiral. They‚Äôd dream of the Devouring Spiral, muttering its patterns in their sleep. Then their bodies changed: skin growing spiral marks, eyes glowing faintly. One guy shook and twisted into the spiral‚Äôs shape, yelling old words before he died. Elena figured the bio-tech was tapping into something cosmic, rewiring their brains and bodies to match the ancients‚Äô patterns.

The world got excited. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leveling up!‚Äù Elena said in a shaky video broadcast. They started powering cities with this stuff. One night, outside the base, Elena watched kids playing in the desert, laughing and chasing each other. A scientist, Dr. Lin, stood nearby and said quietly, ‚ÄúIs this worth it? What are we giving up?‚Äù Elena didn‚Äôt know what to say, her science-first mindset starting to crack.

The tunnels got creepier‚Äîwalls seemed to breathe, and Sam‚Äôs voice called out: ‚ÄúElena, I‚Äôm here.‚Äù She almost fell into a dark pit chasing it before someone pulled her back. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs playing with us,‚Äù she said, freaked out.

Elena, desperate, led another ritual to control a big bio-device, ignoring everyone‚Äôs worries. ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll fix things,‚Äù she said, still guilty about the first mess-up. They chanted‚Äîthen boom. The room warped, air thick like jelly. A silent flash took half the team‚Äîforty people, gone. Part of the pyramid caved in, trapping more. Elena made it out, banged up and broken inside. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm such an idiot,‚Äù she cried, her trust in science gone, finally seeing there was something bigger at play.

# The Scary Truth

They found a tough glyph with the Devouring Spiral. Using a mix of AI and bio-tech, they cracked it: the ancients were scared of something they called the ‚Äúeraser,‚Äù something that wiped them out. Creepy shadow creatures with bone claws started showing up, fighting the teams. Elena battled one, its touch like ice that burned, leaving scars on her arm and her heart.

‚ÄúWe can beat this,‚Äù she told her team, but she wasn‚Äôt sure. They got a big bio-screen working, and it showed an ancient person in robes, looking terrified. ‚ÄúStop trying to be more. Growing too much gets their attention‚Äîthe ones who made us. We‚Äôre just supposed to exist, not be like them. If you make new life or master the stars, they come. They‚Äôre like‚Ä¶ they drink the whole universe.‚Äù

World leaders didn‚Äôt listen. ‚ÄúGet ready to fight,‚Äù they said. Elena, beat down and missing Sam, tried to warn them, but no one cared.

# The Silence Protocol

As Elena‚Äôs team started to understand the bio-tech, piecing together the ancients‚Äô knowledge, something strange happened. One night, deep in the pyramid‚Äôs tunnels, Elena linked to a bio-device. Her mind flooded with visions‚Äînot just the Spiral, but Sam. His face flickered, his voice clear: ‚ÄúElena, you‚Äôre close. Find the heart. I‚Äôm with you.‚Äù It felt real, like his soul was somehow tied to the bio-tech, guiding her. She followed his whispers through twisting passages, each step marked by the Devouring Spiral glowing on the walls. At last, she reached a hidden chamber, a place that felt wrong, like it didn‚Äôt belong on Earth. A machine sat there‚Äînot bio-tech, not metal, but something ancient and alive. The Devouring Spiral was everywhere, growing like veins, leading to its glowing center.

She‚Äôd figured it out.

The ancients got wiped out because they knew too much. Just knowing stuff woke up something outside reality, something that saw them. Now it was happening again. People were disappearing‚Äînot dead, just gone. Families looked at empty seats, confused. Old photos lost faces, like they were never there. No noise, no blood, just nothing.

There was no way to fight it.

Sam‚Äôs voice, soft in her mind, explained the fix: the Silence Protocol, a way to make everyone forget the glyphs. But it came with a terrible price‚Äîhalf the people on Earth would vanish, picked by the Spiral itself.

Elena stood before the machine, its glow almost alive. She thought of Sam, his voice guiding her here, and her daughter, Mia, who she‚Äôd barely seen in years. ‚ÄúI got us into this,‚Äù she whispered, tears streaming. With Sam‚Äôs presence steadying her, she typed the final words, her voice breaking: ‚ÄúLet us forget‚Ä¶ so we can stay.‚Äù

The Spiral lit up. The world didn‚Äôt break‚Äîit faded. Cities blinked out. Books turned blank. Computers glitched. History rewrote itself. The creators stopped looking, their gaze lifted. Humanity was safe, hidden in the dark of not knowing.

# Epilogue

It‚Äôs 2065.

Elena, now pushing seventy, sat on a cozy couch in her California home. The world was normal again‚Äîno one remembered the glyphs, the rituals, or the chaos. The pyramids were just tourist traps. Titan was a far-off mystery nobody cared about. Elena had moved back, reconnected with her daughter, Mia, now a mom herself. They‚Äôd patched things up, spending quiet evenings together to make up for lost years.

Tonight, they were watching a cheesy sci-fi movie, munching popcorn. Mia laughed at a goofy alien scene. ‚ÄúMom, you used to dig up stuff like this, right? All those old rocks?‚Äù

Elena smiled, her heart heavy with secrets. ‚ÄúYeah, kiddo. Old news.‚Äù

The movie cut to a news alert. The anchor sounded excited: ‚ÄúBig news from NASA! A new probe on Titan just sent back pictures of strange carvings‚Äîsuper clear glyphs, sharper than anything we‚Äôve seen. They look like some old Earth symbols, but these are so clear, like they were carved yesterday. Scientists are buzzing‚Äîcould this mean alien life?‚Äù

The screen showed the glyphs: the Devouring Spiral, brighter, sharper, almost glowing. Elena‚Äôs popcorn slipped from her hand. Mia tilted her head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs neat, huh? Like your old digs.‚Äù

Elena‚Äôs heart pounded. This wasn‚Äôt chance. The universe was pushing the Spiral back, making it clearer, like it¬†*wanted*¬†to be seen. It was as if reality itself was trying to wake the creators, nudging humanity toward a cliff. She grabbed Mia‚Äôs hand, whispering, ‚ÄúNot now‚Ä¶‚Äù

Outside, the stars flickered too fast. Elena knew she‚Äôd stopped the cycle once, but it was starting again. The Spiral was calling, and this time, it might not let them hide.",1,1757838130.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm enjoying a lazy Sunday in bed and thought what a treat it would be to have someone bring me coffee and breakfast in bed. Like an add-on door dash service. 

Wouldn‚Äôt be hard. I could install a security system with a code, then give the delivery person the code and they could just bring the coffee and breakfast to me in my room. I could even put a bed tray next to my bed the night before. Or as long as I‚Äôm having a fantasy, leave it on the kitchen counter and pay them extra to plate it before bringing it up. 

I‚Äôd pay extra for this experience. At least once in awhile. 

To be clear, I might also ask for a woman delivery person. Not looking for more than breakfast. üòÅ",1,1757837856.0,CasualConversation,7,0.67,False

I went on a whim last minute by myself and it was packed so I just stood near the bar to see if a seat became available. So I am watching the pre fight and this guy sitting at the bar in front of me ask me what my favorite kind of shot/drink was my favorite. Conversation went from there and we talked a bit about the fight,  work, him moving to fort worth. He was there with his 2 guy friends and maybe 10 minutes into the Conversation he asked me if I am toxic. I replied to him ""are you afraid of commitment?"" 
He said no so I told him I wasn't toxic. Then the conversation kinda stopped. A seat at the bar became available and I sat down next to his guy friends. They left maybe 15 or so minutes after that so they didn't stay for the fight. 
I just wanna know what makes guys think is ok to ask that kind of question at all, specially to somone you just met. Are guys specifically looking for toxic girls is that what it is?! Do guys not value mentally stable girls who have their life together.?
After they left a random guy sat next to me and over the next 40 minutes tried to take me home with him. He made conversations with me but kept interrupting me saying ""oh I live down the street, we should and just talk"" and to that I replied ""we're talking right now"". He kept asking if I was having fun and kept asking to go talk. I eventually started ignoring him and he left before the big fight.
He didn't even bother asking if I wanted to get coffee, hang out he didn't even offer to buy me a drink or even dinner. I have been disappointed in the past by guys I randomly gone home with so now I ask for at least dinner at waffle house because the sex almost always dissipating. 
So are guys going to sport bars trying to pick up girls there?! Or was this just me on an isolated event. Is this the new normal?! Am I missing something ",0,1757837837.0,FortWorth,2,0.41,False

It has been 5 weeks and I only missed 2 days, which is not bad. I am in school for early childhood education and i am learning so much. I am 5'1 and 145 pounds. I'm fat. I feel fat. I look fat. My upper stomach spills out of everything I wear. I don't fit anything I wear. With the fitness app I am using, I realized I have been putting in not real calories. I drink coffee 3 cups a day, 3 tablespoons per cup. I just realized each cup is 100 calories. I tried not drinking soda and my coffee doubled. Those days i am doing homework late at night I am drinking coffee. I feel like a faker. I want to lose weight. I was on a good track for like, 30 days and I lost it. I got very lazy, again. Now I am back to feeling sorry for myself. I walk about 2 hours, over 5 miles, 3mph, but that isn't burning enough. My partner has been going to the gym for about 2 years now and he has watched his body change so much. In the year we have been dating I have seen his body transform right before my eyes. I have no idea how he does it and honestly, I am jealous. 

We are both prior military. We both dated when we were 18. He has seen my body at its fittest. I am upset. Younger me, I was extremely fit. I worked out every single day since 7th grade. To be fair, it was stretching and training my body to be as flexible as humanly possible. I achieved all 3 splits and then I transitioned to endurance to prepare myself for the Army. I roller bladed every single day for 3 months. Then I added running. I skated 12 miles and then ran 2. I would charge my phone to 100% and come home when my phone died, without not once changing the song playing on my phone. I am so jealous of younger me. A month before I left for the Army, I quit all sugary drinks and cut caffeine completely.  

Now i just see myself as a fat pig. Why can't i be her again. I was her. If i never found out about my lung disease I would've never stopped working out. I am fat. I cannot fit a single thing in my closet. I came on here to really pour my heart out because this is making me so angry. Why is it so hard to just stop eating? I am getting into the groove of things, but I want to lose as much weight as possible. I wanted to develop an ED, but I cant because I love food. I hate this whiney baby I am being right now

I want to try to only drink 2 cups of coffee, and drink water the rest of the day. I will start jogging every other day. I will walk every single day. I think after I am done with this post of me bitching and crying I will find a 30 day challenge or a hardcore workout challenge",1,1757837650.0,u_kitttywrang,0,1.0,False

**About me:**
- 28, from NSW. 174cm / 5‚Äô8 with blue eyes, brown hair (growing it out in the middle of a 1/3 life crisis).
- Pale enough to blind you in direct sunlight. Tomato mode enabled if I stay out too long.
- Work in tech/finance ‚Äî not a c.r.y.p t.o bro, don‚Äôt worry.

**Personality:**
- Shy/anxious at first, talkative once I warm up.
- Introvert, but I still enjoy a night out with friends.
- Not religious, so probably won‚Äôt mesh well with someone deeply religious.

**Hobbies:**
- Gaming (mostly chill stuff, solo or with mates on Discord).
- Golf (badly).
- Metalcore fan: Polaris, Thornhill, Sleep Token.
- Staying up too late ruining my sleep schedule watching Piastri chase the Aussie WDC dream.

I‚Äôve tried apps, but no luck. Looking for someone in Australia to share the small stuff with ‚Äî coffee runs, errands, chilling at home ‚Äî and hopefully the big stuff too (travelling with a partner >>> travelling with family).

I'm done feeling like the only person who had dreams was him. I'm done dulling my shine so that he can feel like he had a spark. I'm done saying sorry like I'm apologizing for simply existing. I'm done crying over not getting a seat at a table Jesus would have flipped.

I want to bring them flowers and coffee in bed.  I wanna geek out and dance and sing. I want to be able to talk to my partner without being looked at like I'm crazy or stupid for wanting to slowly get deeper. I want to know everything about them,  so I can be there for them as best I can 

But I'm scared. And scarred. And normally that wouldn't bother me but I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I don't know what the first step is.
