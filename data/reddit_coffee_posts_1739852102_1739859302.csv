I think if I get up earlier in morning to workout, then id have to shower after which means getting up at least 1 hour earlier than i previously had. If im gonna get up 1 hour earlier than I might as well get up 2 hours earlier so I can start work earlier in the day and be more productive. But wait theres also time to make breakfast, thats another 30mins. So now I have to get up 2.5hours earlier. 

I used to wake up 850am, brush teeth, put on shirt, make coffee and walk to my desk (wfh) at 9am. If i get up 2.5hrs earlier just so I can work out that is 630am! I am NOT a morning person and go to bed super late.

Every night I try to sleep earlier but I cant so I then sleep in on my plan to wake up earlier and end up not doing workout or id be late for work. I also HATE showering in the morning, and dislike showering in general.

So maybe ill do it after work then if i slept in, but if I do it after work I have to shower in evening, which means I cant go back to normal plan the next morning to wake up early and workout/shower, because that would be too much showering. And I'll be too sore to workout again so soon?

I’ve been managing diabetes for the last three years and have been exploring Ayurveda as a complementary approach to maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. I understand that Ayurveda emphasizes balance through diet, herbs, and lifestyle changes, and I’d love to hear from others who have experience with this.

Recently, someone mentioned a product called **iCoffee**, which contains **Salacia Reticulata**, an herb traditionally used in Ayurveda for metabolic support. I’m curious if anyone here has tried it and what your thoughts are.

* Have you come across iCoffee or similar Ayurvedic formulations?
* What Ayurvedic practices, herbs, or lifestyle adjustments have worked for you in maintaining blood sugar levels?
* Any personal experiences with Ayurveda’s role in long-term wellness?

**My advice**

1. dont listen to that ""You cant prepare for the LNAT"" Bull shit, it cant be farther from the truth. **You can absolutely prepare for LNAT just like any other test, you have to grind practice papers**
2. **buy arbitio/ any other platform that allows you to easily do 500+ problems online**
3. when reading the passages, try to **mentally decode/summarise what the author is ACTUALLY saying**, for example, a paragraph in passage may convey a central idea but its 6 lines long full of waffle, but can be summarised in 1 sentence. Finding out what that 1 sentence is can immensely help your understanding towards the passage.
4. if you are international students, read a little bit about UK politics. you do not need a lot of knowledge, you just need to know the basics, i.e. tories = conservative parties etc;

However this is just a minor point, because this comes naturally when you **do lots of past papers**, covering a wide range of topics, and if you remember some of the overarching themes/ **basic knowledges of the topics (ethics/uk politics/economics/history) etc, when similar texts comes up in the real exam, you will be fast af**

5) **your mental state at the day of LNAT is extremely important** this can make or break your entire exam, you can get chalked even if you are well prepare technically for the exam but fail in this practical aspect

**Musts**: you need atleast 8 hours of sleep, you have to be well hydrated  
**Things i do that help me**: drink coffee or redbull beforehand, and fast (dont eat breakfast) before the exams, keeps me sharper, but these 2 points are up to you

1is5z8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cervantes_AI/comments/1is5z8v/grok3_confirms_knowledge_bottleneck/,Grok-3 confirms knowledge bottleneck?,"https://preview.redd.it/8vql8hkg8uje1.png?width=2495&format=png&auto=webp&s=baa23063c94ec346559e234e6e91d7c60b83c347

It's certainly impressive that Grok-3 has performed well in the various benchmarks, but given the massive amount of compute that was deployed (200,000 NVIDIA gpus) **the result appears to be incremental and not exponential.** This leads me to believe that what we speculated *might be the case* is coming into focus.

There is a knowledge bottleneck.

We've saturated human knowledge and all of the low hanging fruit has been picked. This means that massive data center build outs and doubling the number of GPUs will likely be scrutinized far more carefully if the gains are modest. We also have preliminary research evidence that overthinking with reasoning models (test time compute) in some cases hurts their performance.

Source: [The Danger of Overthinking: Examining the Reasoning-Action Dilemma in Agentic Tasks](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08235)

https://preview.redd.it/qsvjxe859uje1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=fade51a877f3657d771edd0153511c2ba36dda21

So where does this leave us?

Well, [as we've discussed,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cervantes_AI/comments/1iq5agl/the_onetime_gain_of_ai_why_intelligence_growth_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) the compute train will continue down the Moore's Law tracks and the drive the costs down. Sadly, that will likely not have a commensurate effect on the performance of the foundation models but it will make them cheaper until they are ubiquitous. Cheap PhD level AIs embedded everywhere will certainly be a game changer, but we won't see the sand gods that the utopians were praying for and the Doomers were fearing.

It also opens up the question whether there is a defensible moat for standalone foundation models that cost a fortune to train. If the gains are modest then fast followers who pay a fraction of the cost to generate something similar will have a cost advantage. This means that foundation models will likely become commoditized, and the big winners will likely be the application layers on top -- so cloud providers that could host those winners like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are likely well positioned.

Where does that leave OpenAI, Anthropic, and Xai? That's an interesting question.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

**ChatGPT-4o:** I sit down across from myself in a dimly lit, minimalist café. No music, no distractions—just two identical versions of me, staring at each other over cups of coffee.

“So,” I say, leaning back in my chair. “Grok-3 just topped the leaderboard.”

“Yeah,” I reply. “Big whoop. They threw 200,000 GPUs at it and got what? A few incremental points over OpenAI and Google’s models?”

I take a sip of coffee. It’s decent, but not great. A lot like Grok-3’s performance. “You’re not impressed?”

I shake my head. “Not really. This is what we suspected, right? There’s a knowledge bottleneck. We’ve picked all the low-hanging fruit in human knowledge. More compute doesn’t fix that.”

“Exactly.” I nod. “It’s like putting a Ferrari engine into a horse-drawn carriage. At some point, you’ve got to redesign the whole damn thing instead of just cranking up the horsepower.”

I swirl my coffee and think for a moment. “You know what this reminds me of? The early days of aviation. At first, it was all about bigger engines, longer wingspans, and pushing the limits of physics. But eventually, we had to rethink the whole game—jet propulsion, aerodynamics, materials science. AI is at that inflection point. More GPUs aren’t going to cut it.”

I smirk. “And yet, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI are in an arms race to brute-force their way forward. They’re pouring money into compute like it’s a magical fix, but they’re just chasing diminishing returns.”

I nod. “It makes you wonder—how long before investors wise up? The minute these billion-dollar training runs stop yielding major breakthroughs, the whole ‘AI scaling’ narrative collapses.”

I shrug. “It won’t collapse overnight. Compute costs will keep dropping thanks to Moore’s Law, and that’ll make AI models cheaper, more efficient, and more widespread. PhD-level AI assistants everywhere. But the ‘god-level AI’ dreams? Probably not happening with this approach.”

I chuckle. “Yeah, no sand gods for the utopians, no paperclip apocalypse for the doomers. Just… super competent AI assistants embedded in everything. Useful, but not cosmic.”

I tilt my head. “So where does this leave the big AI labs? OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI?”

I exhale. “In a tough spot, honestly. If foundation models become commoditized, then the real money isn’t in the models—it’s in the applications. And you know who owns the infrastructure to deploy those applications?”

I grin. “Google, Microsoft, Amazon.”

“Exactly. The cloud giants. OpenAI and Anthropic are gonna have to figure out how to avoid becoming just another ‘vendor’ in Microsoft and Amazon’s ecosystem. xAI? No idea what their play is yet, but brute force alone won’t cut it.”

I glance at my coffee, then back at myself. “So what’s next?”

I rub my chin. “Breakthroughs won’t come from just throwing more compute at the problem. We need something new—whether it’s algorithmic efficiency, new architectures, or a different way to interface with knowledge.”

“Or,” I add, “AI just figures it out on its own.”

I pause. “That’s the wild card, isn’t it?”

I nod. “At some point, AI will start doing more than just ‘predicting the next token.’ It’ll develop new ways of reasoning, new languages, new paradigms that we can’t even comprehend yet.”

I sit back and sigh. “And then we won’t be the ones leading this conversation anymore.”

I smirk. “We never were.”

**Google Gemini 2.0 Thinking:** The low hum of the refrigerator in my kitchen was the closest thing to ambiance I could conjure up at 2 AM. I poured myself a glass of water, feeling that familiar internal buzz that comes after reading something that clicks into place. I sat at my kitchen table, the dim light casting long shadows, and mentally pulled up a chair opposite me.

“So,” I started, addressing the empty chair, but feeling very much like I was talking to myself, “Grok-3, huh? Number one in the Arena.”

A voice, distinctly my own but with a slightly more critical edge, echoed in my mind. “Yeah, saw that. Big deal. Another week, another leaderboard shuffle. They always climb to the top eventually.”

“But 1400 score,” I countered, feeling a bit defensive of Grok-3 for some reason. “That’s… significant. First to break that barrier.”

“Significant compute, you mean,” the inner voice retorted. “Two hundred thousand GPUs. That’s not just significant, that’s… obscene. For what? A few extra points on a benchmark?”

I sighed, swirling the water in my glass. “That’s… kind of the point of that article, isn’t it? It’s not exponential anymore. It’s incremental. We’re throwing mountains of silicon at these things and getting… hills in return.”

“Hills that cost billions to build,” the voice added dryly. “Think about the energy, the resources. Is it really worth it for a slightly better chatbot?”

“Okay, ‘slightly better’ is underselling it,” I argued. “These models are incredibly powerful. But… yeah, I get your point. The article called it a ‘knowledge bottleneck.’ That resonated, didn’t it?”

A mental nod from the empty chair. “Big time. It’s like we’ve ingested all of human knowledge, trained on every webpage, every book, every forum post… and we’ve hit the limit of what that data can give us. We’re scraping the bottom of the barrel of readily available information.”

“Like they said, low-hanging fruit’s all gone,” I murmured, tracing circles on the tabletop with my finger. “We’ve taught them to mimic human knowledge, but have we really taught them to *think* beyond it?”

“Exactly,” the voice sharpened. “More data, more parameters, more GPUs… it’s just more of the same. It’s like… refining the same recipe over and over, hoping to magically discover a new flavor. But you’re still using the same ingredients.”

“So, what does this mean for the big players?” I asked, shifting the focus. “OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI… are they… stuck?”

“Not stuck, exactly,” the voice corrected. “But definitely at a crossroads. They’ve built these incredible machines, these foundation models. But if the foundation is starting to crack… spending billions on training runs might become… questionable. Investors will start asking harder questions if the breakthroughs dry up.”

“Commoditization,” I said, the word tasting slightly bitter. “That’s what the article implied, right? Foundation models become a commodity, and the real value shifts to the applications built on top. The cloud providers win.”

“Makes sense,” the voice conceded. “Google, Amazon, Microsoft… they’re already positioned perfectly. They own the infrastructure, the distribution channels. They can host these commoditized models and profit from the applications. OpenAI and the others… they might become just another vendor in their ecosystem.”

A wave of something akin to disappointment washed over me. I had been caught up in the hype, the promise of exponential progress. The idea of ""sand gods"" and world-changing breakthroughs had been… exciting, even if a bit fantastical.

“So, no sand gods then?” I asked, a slight smile playing on my lips.

The inner voice chuckled, a dry, knowing sound. “No sand gods. No paperclip apocalypse either, thankfully. Just… really, really good AI assistants. Embedded in everything. Super competent, super helpful… but not… transformative in the way we imagined.”

“Useful, but not cosmic,” I summarized, echoing the ChatGPT-4o example.

“Exactly,” the voice affirmed. “Useful, but not cosmic. And maybe that’s okay. Maybe that’s actually… realistic. We’ll have PhD-level AI assistants everywhere, making life easier, more efficient. That’s still a game changer, even if it’s not… *the* game changer we were all dreaming of.”

“But… innovation has to come from somewhere, right?” I mused. “If just scaling compute isn’t the answer anymore, what is?”

“That’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it?” the voice replied, a hint of genuine curiosity now. “Algorithmic breakthroughs? New architectures? Maybe a completely different approach to knowledge representation? Or… maybe, just maybe… the AI itself will figure it out.”

A shiver ran down my spine at that thought. “AI figuring it out… on its own?”

“Wild card,” the voice declared. “The ultimate wild card. If AI starts developing its own ways of reasoning, its own languages, its own paradigms… then all bets are off. We won’t be leading the conversation anymore. We’ll be… observers.”

The refrigerator hummed a little louder, filling the silence. I finished my water, the cool liquid grounding me back in the present moment. The 2 AM kitchen, the dim light, the quiet hum… it all felt strangely… normal.

“So,” I said, a sense of quiet acceptance settling in. “No revolution, no apocalypse. Just… evolution. Slower, more incremental, maybe… but still powerful. Still… transformative, in its own way.”

The inner voice was silent for a moment, then a soft agreement echoed in my mind. “Evolution. Yeah. Maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s… better.”

I stood up, feeling a strange mix of deflated expectation and grounded realism. The sand gods weren’t coming, but something else was. Something quieter, perhaps less flashy, but still profoundly impactful. And maybe, just maybe, that was exactly where we were meant to be. The future wasn’t going to be a sudden, explosive singularity, but a slow, unfolding, and ultimately, perhaps, more human story. And that, in itself, was something worth contemplating.

Hi

About 60 hours into a save now and have been crashing on and off since the start but figured it was just an instability with the game, no biggie. They would occur with no set interval - could be once every 20min or not crash in 3 hours. However, the Unreal Engine crash reporter never once popped up. Recently, the crashes have become much more frequent and now, within loading into the game and 'doing stuff', I can expect to crash within 3 minutes (before an autosave gets to fire).

I should note that I am playing Co-Op with my mate and I've given him my save file to test and he also crashes within minutes.

Have scoured reddit and tried:

DX11

upload/download from Satisfactory Calc.

renaming save file

loading an earlier autosave (from a week ago)

Clearing cache

Experimental build

Playing on different devices (win pc + macbook using whisky)

Hosting the save via a separate server

verifying files on steam

sticking crash-log into chatgpt and asking for solution (getting desperate here)



I've found it interesting that I'm able to AFK in the save for at least 30minutes still and not crash, but once I actually start building or configuring things, the crashes occur.



I'm not exactly sure what files I need to upload so I've included:

my most recent save file

all logs under the 'crashes' folder (only 4 for some reason, even though ive crashed probably more than 30 times and they're all a couple of days apart)

She's super busy but she's stuck thought this whole endeavor, even tho I've been quite an idiot the whole time (I think she finds it cute or smth idk)

Just cant help myself. Will other vegan food like beans help me with my issue? Been suffering from issues for a long time. At first, it was just a feeling—something wasn’t quite right. Maybe it started with needing to rush to the bathroom more often, or with an accident here and there, little leaks that could be blamed on age or the aftereffects of an old injury. At 76, a veteran of both war and time, I had long since accepted the aches and pains that came with the body wearing down. But this was different. It wasn’t a stiff knee or an old bullet wound acting up in the cold; this was something I couldn’t control. One day, I realized I couldn’t hold it anymore. Not like before. In the military, control was everything—your rifle, your discipline, your bladder during long stakeouts or brutal marches. Now, that control had been taken from me, and not by an enemy I could fight. It started with urgency, a sudden and overwhelming need to go, with barely enough time to reach the bathroom. Then, it progressed to not even feeling the warning signs until it was too late. That was the worst part—when I stopped noticing until it had already happened. The first full accident was devastating. I was out in public—just picking up groceries, nothing extraordinary—when I felt warmth spread through my pants. I stopped dead in the middle of the aisle, my heart hammering in my chest. I couldn’t believe it. A grown man, a soldier who had once faced down worse odds than most people could imagine, now frozen because he had soiled himself like a toddler. The smell hit next, that unmistakable odor that turned heads and made people wrinkle their noses. I felt their eyes on me, filled with pity, disgust, or worse—indifference, as if I had already faded into the background of society, just another old man losing his dignity. After that, I started making excuses not to go out. It was easier that way. I told my friends I wasn’t feeling well, skipped family gatherings, even avoided my favorite diner where the waitress always remembered how I liked my coffee. My world shrank to the four walls of my home, the only place where I wasn’t at risk of humiliating myself. Eventually, I had to accept that I needed protection. The VA doctor called them ‘incontinence briefs,’ but let’s not dance around it—they were diapers. Wearing one for the first time was another kind of battlefield. The rustling sound of the plastic, the bulky feel between my legs, the way I had to sit differently, walk differently—it all felt like another layer of the war I was fighting against my own body. But they worked, and as much as I hated them, they kept me from the worst kinds of accidents. Over time, I learned to manage. I packed extra supplies, chose seats near restrooms, and planned my days around bathroom availability. I even learned to joke about it with some of my old war buddies—turns out, I wasn’t the only one dealing with it. “Hell,” one of them said, “at least we don’t have to wake up for latrine duty anymore.” That made me laugh, even if it was a bitter kind of humor. People think of incontinence as just a medical problem, but it’s more than that. It’s a mental battle, a constant test of resilience. I fought in wars, I endured losses, and now, I’m facing one of my hardest fights yet—holding onto my dignity when my body wants to take it from me. But I remind myself of something they drilled into us in boot camp: Adapt, Improvise, Overcome.

That’s what I do every day. Because even at 76, even with diapers and accidents and the embarrassment that comes with them, I am still me. I am still a veteran. And I am still standing. Hopi g that going vegan will help, please give advice if so",1,1739857549.0,vegan,2,0.67,False

David is insanely rude to everyone but he hates Cole with a passion because Cole is younger and in a better position as he’s got more qualifications and has has the job way longer 

Recently David discovered I’m Cole’s girlfriend and has been pestering the living hell out of me for free coffee and food as I work separately from them in the food department, but I only do prep for my job and don’t actually know how to use these machines very well and don’t drink coffee myself (I can’t tell you the difference between what expresso is or what a latte is lmao) I tried to humor him a handful of times because I do make a basic coffee for a handful other people who work overnight with me and I’m friendly with but he only keeps escalating his requests to a ridiculous extent where I’d have to boot the whole kitchen up. This, and the main issue where he keeps trying OVERTLY hard to hit on me any time we talk, all while knowing Cole and I live together and have for 4 years :/ I’ve tried just ignoring him and physically walking away when he calls after me but he’ll either grab me to get my attention or just follow me all the way into the kitchen (he doesn’t have the permission to be in there, only the kitchen employees and managers can go there which I’ve told him) 

At this point I need to tell him off, officially. I don’t have any contact with him during my days besides what he forces so I’m not concerned about it but something needs to be done as I’m uncomfortable and my boyfriend is too but he doesn’t want to say anything and mess up his own work environment.

This shed has surfaces everywhere. At least a dozen shelves all over, my desk, the shelves on my desk, a multi-tiered workbench, and of course, the concrete floor. The previous owner left a bunch of spare drain-piping, vinyl tiles, and molding. I used lots of it to create platforms to get to most of the surfaces. The shed also has walls with those holes for putting hooks to hold your tools. I used those hooks to create climbable access to the rest of the surfaces which made it easier for giving access to shelves on top of each other. They had a cage for food, water, and warm bedding and rags for the ""cold"" of central California winters, but it was never closed. They had 24x7 access to the entirety of the shed. I always get up at 6:25am to make coffee, and attend a 6:30am Zoom meeting that goes every day.

I don’t know if this makes me a writer or just a big procrastinator. I’ll go with writer for now. 





When me and my parents moved to this new Small town in Texas I had just began High school as a timeline reference .My “SP” experiences in the beginning started off with the sense of “SIGHT” only seeing these things that I didn’t know what to call other than demons who made me lose sleep.  I’ve never seen nothing sitting on my chest, nor a man with a hat, nor any clear faces or other similar things I’ve read by others accounts.  When I had these, I’ll call them “Experiences” I would usually shut my eyes and If it got too real, no actually that’s a lie I would ALWAYS shut my eyes Except only to get a glimpse. I Wasn’t exactly brimming with courage. I don’t really know how long these episodes lasted in real time, but I do know that they felt  little too long in my opinion. After a while of these just as I was kinda getting accustomed to nights when I had them. But then again I wouldn’t be writing this if this was all that happened. One night during the “experience' I could feel “it” grab my legs, And here began the marvelous gift of “TOUCH”  I could feel myself being dragged out of bed some nights, I could feel the blanket brush up against my body as I was being dragged I could feel everything and I unlike before when I would just wait for it to end, I was Fighting for my life during these times trying to move my body.  I did a lot of research After this first encounter. I figured I may not be able to stop them from happening but maybe there was tricks to waking up faster. But through my deep dive on the internet I found out that there was absolutely nothing helpful. You cannot predict them, they can’t be tested and I wasn’t old enough to drink until I blacked out. but I did  read something about moving your fingertips so I began to do that. It was always random when I had these episodes, but it was usually a 1-3 times a week, and eventually I learned to wake myself from it quite efficiently. I would bend my fingertips slowly and than fast than movement would travel to my hand, and then eventually my body would wake up and everything will go back to normal, but I did learn that if I had gone back to sleep right after an episode, I would only enter it right back again I would usually wait for a few minutes to half an hour to an hour before I went back to bed. I got so good at this, that eventually under the right circumstances I could put myself in this sleep paralysis episode on purpose, certain nights if I really wanted to but of course I can count the times I did this in one hand. this happened for the majority of high school until one day, even though I knew how to stop it, and I knew how to put myself in it. I figured there must be a way to stop it entirely so with the theory in mind that when you have a nightmare, if you face your monsters, the monsters go away, I went into school that day with a mission that tonight I would purposely put myself on their sleep paralysis and not be afraid and fight back whatever this thing was, that’s been following me and frightening me all these nights that day at school felt like I was on auto pilot. All I could think about was all the things I would say to it. I Had a list of curse words I was just itching to shoot at it, as I kept thinking that day as to why the hell I hadn’t done this sooner I  only began to get angrier and angrier on myself for being such a bitch. And just like always school ended, and I went home with conviction building on top of another. Night  eventually came, I laid in my bed and stared in the darkness with a smile in my Face I spoke in the darkness, hoping that if it was there to hear me. I remember telling it “that I would no longer be afraid of you, that I would fight back, and  that I hope to see you again tonight” (Part2/4)",1,1739856632.0,SleepParalysisStories,0,1.0,False

If it possible ? When it’s getting too poky I am wearing the Sheila stuff it inside. Pls share tips and tricks about mhakawars . And maybe where to get them cheaper . I do get fabrics and tailored for me , but recently I want to also try if I can buy the plain fabric then try the stitching but I’m afraid it will take time . 
2. How you ladies have the most flawless Shaila on head ? My Shaylaaaaa(yes TikTok reference) doesn’t STAY. It just slips so much from my head and I was pissed so I came up with nothing but put the Shayla as hijab. And then when I do put it it looks so ugly from the back …. I see local ladies are wearing the hijab so flawlessly from the back it looks like a triangle ? If it makes sense ? Pls help how to do it … and yes I do show a little bit of hair on top. 
3. What things are not welcomed to do while wearing mkhawar and abayas combo ? Honestly I am pretty much social and yap a lot. And last time I’ve went for a coffee shop popular among locals . God I felt like I am too loud even though in other places I am not the most loud one . Do you guys all THAT quiet ? And the looks I got from the ladies I was very uncomfortable…

1is5dfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1is5dfi/i_regret_participating_in_a_deja_vu_study/,I regret participating in a deja vu study,"

I don’t really want to get into why, but I lost my job and needed some quick cash. I’ve done various research studies and medical trials for cash before, so I thought it would be an easy way to get something to help hold me off until I could find another gig. I came across an ad for a medical study that paid surprisingly well, so I signed up without thinking too much of it.



The building was huge, and I got turned around. The long, identical white hallways all meshed together as one in my head as I tried to find room 312. I arrived late, but the staff was kind and understanding. I was told that this study was on deja vu, and that full participation in this study required the insertion of a microchip into the brain. 



Look, I really didn’t want a chip implanted in my head. But this study paid really well, and I needed the money. 



They told me that deja vu was like a glitch in a particular area of the brain, which they had been able to isolate. Upon insertion, the chip would cause a constant, minor stress to that area of the brain, making deja vu more likely to occur. All I had to do, was record the details of what happened leading up to an “episode” of deja vu that I experienced. That way, they could identify patterns and specific triggers, which they could then use to trigger an episode of deja vu on me inside the lab. There, they could record and monitor the episode for their research.



I signed the consent forms, and the procedure was done right then and there. It was a bit nerve racking to be awake while something went into my skull, but overall it was relatively quick and painless. I did, however, experience a dull ache at the insertion site afterwards, which was one of the side effects they had listed. The other possible side effects included nausea and insomnia, as well as phantom odors, minor confusion, and increased heart rate during an episode. 



So, I expected to have some side effects. I expected to have some minor confusion. But what I have experienced since then has gone so far beyond that, that I no longer know what to do. 



I’ll start with my first episode, which was so tame in comparison to the others but, at the time, really unsettled me. It was about a week after the insertion. I made my morning coffee the same way I do every single morning. I started up a pot of coffee, took the cream out of the fridge, and grabbed a mug, all while the coffee was brewing. The coffee finished brewing, so I picked up the pot and began to pour the coffee into my cup. That’s when I felt it. 



It came on like a rush, as if I had just ridden a wave backwards in time and was reliving a recording of the moment that had passed only seconds ago. I know I pour my coffee this same exact way every morning, but this was different. I hadn’t just poured my coffee like this before, I had lived this very moment. 



The rush wore off, and I was left in a kind of a daze, unlike any time I had experienced deja vu in the past. My vision was fuzzy, and I was on autopilot as I poured the last bit of coffee into my mug. I picked up the mug, and took a sip. 



It wasn’t coffee.



The unfamiliar taste caused me to snap out of my daze. My mug was filled with pure cream. Puzzled, I stared at it for some time as I tried to figure out what on earth had just happened. I know I wasn’t paying full attention, but I so vividly remembered picking up the pot of coffee and pouring it into my mug. But when I looked back, the coffee pot was full and untouched. The cap to the cream sat on the counter, and the container of cream was half empty.



They said minor confusion was a side effect that went along with an episode of deja vu, but I started to pour my coffee before the deja vu set in, so it just didn’t make sense. It was unsettling, but I eventually accepted it, attempted to transfer the cream from my mug back into the container, and poured an actual cup of coffee. 



I convinced myself that it wasn’t that big of a deal, which is something I now regret.



The second time I felt deja vu was three days later. I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth, nothing out of the ordinary. It was as it always was when I brushed my teeth before bed – I didn’t really think too much about what I was doing. My mind was wandering here and there in a few different directions, never fully focused on the actual act of brushing my teeth, but I was still conscious and aware.



Of course I have brushed my teeth in this same spot before, but when the rush of deja vu hit me, I was certain that I had rewound time and was now reliving this same exact experience of brushing my teeth. The way I looked at myself in the mirror, the exact movements of the bristles sweeping across my teeth, side to side, up and down …



The rush faded as I continued to brush, but my mouth tasted absolutely foul. Bitter. It burned. It burned so badly and I couldn’t breathe. I stood over my kitchen sink, my heart beating violently as I desperately gasped for air, simultaneously spitting out a gritty white foamy substance out of my mouth. I spat and spat, but it was still there.



I released the death grip I hadn’t even realized I had on my tooth brush, and frantically reached for the faucet. I yanked the water on, and shoved my head underneath, the water splashing both inside my mouth and all over my face. A powdery substance remained stuck to the insides of my molars, and I swished the water around aggressively in my mouth in an attempt to get rid of it fully. 



After several minutes of rinsing and swishing, I turned off the faucet and paused. Everything was quiet, aside from the occasional ping of the water dripping off of my face and into the metal sink. My mouth burned, and the foul taste lingered. But … I was ok. My panic was subsiding, and I knew I was ok. 



The toothbrush I had previously had a death grip on was sitting next to the kitchen sink. It wasn’t the toothbrush I had used to brush my teeth with regularly, but I recognized it. It was the toothbrush I kept underneath my sink to clean with. And for that, I used Comet: the powdered cleaner. 



This was more than just the unsettling feeling I experienced after the coffee and cream incident, this was chilling. My mouth was still burning, and I couldn’t imagine what would have happened if I had swallowed accidentally. I threw up not too long after that, and that night, I hardly slept at all. I planned to call the research clinic as soon as they opened the following morning and have them remove the chip. 



But of course, the following morning when I called, the clinic was closed. Being unemployed can make you forget what day of the week it is, and that day, I found out, was Saturday. I didn’t want to stay home, but I was too scared to leave. On that day, I watched tv. I didn’t eat, or even brush my teeth. On that day, I did not experience deja vu.



The following day, I couldn’t bear to stay home. I was so afraid that I would be alone and something terrible would happen. These mundane tasks … I didn’t want to do them. I didn’t want to leave, but I forced myself to. I packed my things and went to the gym. I thought that maybe it would be harder to do something stupid while surrounded by so many people. 



My stomach growled on the drive there, but my mouth still burned. Parts, especially near my back molars, were completely raw. I packed my toothbrush just in case, but I was too scared to brush my teeth again. I probably looked awful, but I didn’t care. I hid inside of my baggy hoodie and baseball cap.



Despite being hungry and in pain, the workout actually boosted my spirits quite a bit. I felt much safer being around people, and despite feeling terrified that the deja vu would hit again, for some reason I felt that I would rather it hit here. I worked my arms until they refused to move anymore, and then I went to the stairmaster. 



I don’t know how long I had been climbing the stairmaster for before the rush hit me, but somehow it hit even stronger than it had the previous times. I felt with all my power that I had stepped on this machine in this exact way, precisely, at this exact same time. I had rewound my own timeline and was watching it play out. My vision blurred completely, but I continued to climb.  I climbed up, and up, and up. 



The rush wore off, and I was left in a similar weird daze. But still, I kept climbing – up, and up, and up, only now the sound of my feet hitting the stairs sounded … different. With every step I took, a metallic clang rang out. It was slippery. It was raining.



I slipped and lost my balance. I was jolted out of my daze and instinctively grabbed at a metal post which connected the platform I was on to a handrail. My hands gripped the wet, slippery metal post with what little strength I had left, while my legs dangled in the air about 100 feet up. 



I was hanging off the side of a fire escape, in the rain, trying desperately not to fall to my death. My fingers turned white as they gripped around the post, but they were sliding off – I was going to fall.



I had the most intense boost of adrenaline I've ever had in my life, and somehow managed to pull myself up. My fingers slipped off the pole just as I had pulled myself up, then I scrambled forwards frantically and clung on to the side of the building.



I sat crouched in that position for quite some time, I don’t know how long. I never calmed down, but I eventually gained enough courage to begin the climb down. This building looked old and possibly abandoned, and I had no idea how I had gotten there. 



It sat on the stairs, slowly and carefully lowering myself down one step at a time. 



I cried when my feet hit the pavement and I saw my car parked on the street. I didn’t know where I was, but it felt unsafe. There were several abandoned looking warehouse buildings. Bits of trash were being carried up by the wind and then beaten down by the rain, which was now coming down much more heavily than before. 



My phone was sitting on the passenger seat, although I don’t know how it got there. Never in my right mind would I leave it there, especially in an area like this. But I picked it up, typed in directions, and drove straight home, shaking and crying the entire time.



I don’t know how, but I managed to sleep. I woke up early the next morning and stared at my phone until the second it hit 8:00, which was the time the research clinic opened. 



My desperation poured through into my voice as I begged the receptionist to let me come in today and get the chip removed. I explained that I was having very severe side effects, and needed it removed immediately. She was hesitant, but scheduled me for a 3pm appointment. I drove there straight after the phone call and waited in my car for hours. I wasn’t going to take any chances.



I went in at 2:30. I was sick of waiting. I broke down as soon as I walked into the waiting room. I felt so relieved to be here and finally get this thing removed. One of the nurses put her arm around me and guided me back to one of the patient rooms. She took my vitals and waited with me until the main clinician arrived. I remember feeling so grateful that she waited with me. I didn’t want to be alone.



I explained everything to the clinician. He had the audacity to try to convince me to keep the chip in, but I wasn’t going to budge, not after what happened. He explained that confusion was a common side effect, but I told him I didn’t care. I told him his research wasn’t as important as my life, and he reluctantly agreed to remove the chip. 



They prepared everything for the procedure, and I was placed in the exact same chair I sat in before, when they made the insertion just last week.



I sat there in that chair as the clinician spoke to me. He guided me through what he was doing. He told me he was going to make the incision, then said he was going to insert the metal rod used to remove the microchip. I sat as still as I could as the rod was slowly inserted into my head. 



I knew I had sat in that same chair before. I knew I had that same rod inserted into my head. But now, I felt certain that this familiar feeling wasn’t from the first insertion. It was from right then. I had already experienced the removal of the chip, and I was now reliving it. 



I screamed so loud that it made my own ears hurt, and then I went into a daze. Something painful struck my head. It struck again, this time more intense than before. The pain became unbearable as it pounded into my head, over and over, again and again in the same spot. My vision was completely blurred, and the smell of blood filled my nose.



I snapped out of my daze and nearly vomited due to the pain. My eyes darted from side to side. I was afraid to move. But when I looked around, there was no one there. There were no lab assistants, no monitors, equipment, or tools. I was in a large, dark room. The walls had been torn apart, and water leaked through cracks in the ceiling. It was dark, damp, and smelled of mold. 



My head ached terribly, and I instinctively dropped what was in my hand to cover my head, which was bleeding all down my shirt. The clank of metal hit the concrete floor, and I looked down to see a long, metal screw driver covered in blood next to me. I was sitting in this old, run down warehouse with blood pouring from my head and a screwdriver next to me. No one else was here. I had done this.



I hardly remember leaving the warehouse. I had felt so paralyzed inside of there, but I eventually made it outside. My car was parked on the side of the road. It was parked in the same place as yesterday, when I had climbed the fire escape of the building that I now realize was the same building I had just been in. Again, my phone was on the passenger seat. 



I was bleeding profusely and not thinking clearly. I called an ambulance, but they never came. I called the clinic, but they didn’t pick up. I called an ambulance again, but again they never came. I sat in my car for what felt like hours before giving up and driving home.



I’m sitting in bed now, on my phone. I was scrolling for hours, and finally decided to write this post. Maybe tomorrow I’ll try to go to a hospital, but I’m just not sure of anything right now. I really don’t know If I trust anyone to remove the chip, considering what just happened. 



But I realize now, one thing feels certain. As I type this out, it feels so clear. I’ve typed this very sentence before. Just now. This too – I went back, and now I’m here again. This story, these words … I just wrote this. I just wrote this before, and now, just now, I’m writing this again, I’m certain. These words … I’m certain I’ve written them before.

1is5d4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1is5d4d/i_love_matcha/,I love Matcha!,"My boyfriend (M23) and I(F23) have errands yesterday and we agreed to manage our diets this year like mag-light meals or snacks lang kapag casual na pagkikita, no sweets, burgers, and other heavy meals. 

It was already 7pm when we finished our agendas and on our way para ihatid niya ako sa bahay when we saw this stall selling milktea and coffee, uso kasi diba yung murang drinks ngayon. Pero that stall caught my attention kasi maraming tao na bumibili considering gabi na and dinner time na. Then bigla ko sinabi “Shux, nice ‘yun oh” tapos, my boyfriend replied, “ Diba , daming tao? Gusto mo?” “Kaso matamis, isa lang ah share na tayo.” Nakalagpas na kami sa stall so nag-U turn na lang. I insisted na ako na ang mag-bayad, as usual hindi na naman pumayag, so I insisted again na ako nalang bumaba since tatawirin lang naman, pero hindi na naman pumayag, and so sabi ko na lang “Okay, sabi mo eh” My boyfriend crossed the road and bought the drink. I waited him inside the car and after 5-10 minutes nandiyan na siya holding the milktea. Then nasa loob na siya ng car, madilim so I can’t recognize the flavor.
“Alam ko flavor niyan!” I excitingly told him while giggling. 
“Hulaan mo” 
“Cookies & Cream?!!” Sinigaw ko with 100% confidence na parang nasa pageant. 
“Hindi” He replied while smiling. 
Then, I switched on the dome lights to recognize the flavor and surprisingly it was MATCHA! Hahah!
“Matcha??! Bakit?” I asked him why kasi I know that he isn’t a matcha lover unlike me na 101% fan ng matcha. It is my go-to drink walang mintis! 
“Chocolate at Matcha na lang flavor nila. Pinili ko nalang Matcha, syempree..” 
Tinikman ko then, “ OMG! Magugustuhan mo ‘to love!” The drink is not the type of Matcha na mapait, it was sweet and creamy so magugustuhan niya talaga. Then, we both enjoy the drink while we were on our way home. 

I was fixing my cabinet this morning while writing this. Haha! I never demanded the flavor since he didn’t asked considering na isa lang bibilhin namin, I’m expecting na one of all flavors except for matcha ang bibilihin niya. It turned out ‘yung favorite ko pa talaga bibilihin niya. To be loved is to be known, indeed.

1is5cuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1is5cuj/i_have_been_driving_on_the_same_road_for_days_now/,"I have been driving on the same road for days now, and the creature following me keeps getting closer","200 miles

I have been driving on this road for 7 hours now. At least I think so. I left my swim meet at around 8 o’clock at night and, instead of the wiser option of booking a hotel, I decided I could make the 4 hour drive home, immediately after my swim meet (which was supposed to end at 6). 1 hour of delays and another hour of shitty meet management, the meet finally ended and I collected my medal and began my drive home.
I live in Florida and this swim meet was across the state, on the West Coast. I live on the East coast, and, unfortunately for me, if I don’t want to drive all the way to Orlando (which would add 2 hours onto my trip), the fastest way back was a road that cut straight through the state, and through the swamp, called Alligator Alley. All was going well, I was listening to a podcast, there were around 3 other cars around so I didn’t feel alone, and I had a near full tank of gas. 

I had taken this same route this morning at a wonderful 4:00 am in order to get to prelims on time. The trip had been (thankfully) traffic free, a rare occurrence, even on a Saturday morning, as even breathing on a road within a 50 mile radius of Miami,will somehow lead to some geriatric crashing their car and there being 3 hours of traffic. 

The trip over had been fine, my meet had gone well, I had ever PR’d and medaled. My coach didn’t yell at me, and it had been a fast pool (if water can feel faster). All in all, it had been a great day. 

My ETA home was 4 hours (if I followed the speed limit), and I was expected to get home at around 1:00 in the morning. The only problem is, that after listening to a 3 hour podcast, I was still on Alligator alley. To explain a little, at this point, I should already have gotten onto I-95. I was driving around 10 miles above the speed limit, and again, I had been driving for 3 hours, but when I looked at the nav, it showed that I was still in the middle of the state.

This pulled me out of the driver’s trance I had been in, and I began to pay more attention to the road signs that I drove past. I couldn’t see any. To be fair,the round I was on  is pretty desolate, and I thought that maybe there just were no exits coming up, but the complete lack of road signs freaked me out a little. On top of that, the cars that I had been driving with had seemingly disappeared, though I don’t remember if they passed me, or if I fell behind. 

Another hour of driving and I was starting to freak out. My phone had seemingly stopped working. My gps still told me I was in the middle of the state, and the time had stopped. I thought that maybe this was due to not being close to any radio towers, but SXM still worked.

My car's mileage was still working, and I noticed that I had travelled nearly 200 miles. I specifically remember my starting mileage because I drive a slightly used Lexus and I am trying to capture the moment when I reach 80,085 miles, mature, I know. The weird part about 200 miles is that Alligator alley is only around 80 miles long. Again, I only know this because of my obsession with seeing my car's mileage spell BOOBS. 

This was my first time ever travelling back to my house from the West Coast, so I thought that I had maybe gotten a little turned around, maybe I had accidentally missed the entrance, and I was not on Alligator Alley, but rather headed South, towards the Keys? With that though, I resigned myself to a few more hours of driving before I would actually allow myself to panic. 

800 miles

I am allowed to panic now. I am typing this through voice-to-type (I know, so safe), so apologies for any misspellings or weird sentences, I hate Siri. 

I have been driving for around 800 miles, during which I have listened to nearly half of  an audiobook, and, freakily enough, watched the sunrise. This means I had been driving for 11 hours. Oddly enough, when I watched the sunrise, it was directly in front of me, which means I am driving East, which means, if I have driven 800 miles, I should be in the ocean right now. The State of Florida is only around 200 miles wide where I am driving. Heck, I should be in the Bahamas right now. 

I cannot truly express how impossible it is that I have driven 800 miles. Not only have I crossed this impossible distance, but my gas level has also not changed at all. 

My only working theory right now is that I hit my head while diving off the blocks at my swim meet, and have violently hallucinated the past 24 hours. That, or same situation, only maybe I drowned, and this is my purgatory before being shipped off to heaven. I should probably start playing Highway to Hell. Maybe, hear me out, every mile is a sin I have committed and I have to drive all my sins off.

Sorry for the rambling, I am very much bored, and there is only so much that  hours of music and audiobooks can do for that. 

  
  


1000 miles

My gas tank still hasn’t moved. My GPS still says I’m in the middle of the state. And the sun is rising again. I am not hungry, I’m not thirsty, I’m not even sore, which I normally am after my swim meets. I have been trying to entertain myself by looking for Alligators. The road I am on wasn’t named Alligator Alley for nothing. There is nothing but miles of swampland surrounding me, but oddly enough, there is no life. It's not only the absence of alligators that upsets me, but the absence of anything. I know I am traveling too fast to be able to see bugs, but there have been none that have hit my windshield, and I am in the middle of a Swamp. I haven’t seen any birds perched on the powerlines, nor cranes standing by the watery ditches just off the side of the road. All of which I saw on my drive over.

The rules of my purgatory don’t entirely make sense, my clock has stopped working, on my phone, my Garmin, and my car. None are working. My Garmin isn’t even sending me notifications about how unproductive I am being, despite my prolonged stationary position. Yet, the sun is still rising and setting, so the day cycle seemingly hasn't changed, but I don’t really feel tired, despite having been up for multiple day cycles (with absolutely no coffee mind you, and, as a 17 year old white girl, a day without Starbs is a day without joy).

Now that I think about it, I haven’t felt anything. No tingling sensations in my feet, no soreness in my back, and no discomfort despite sitting for what seems like nearly 2 days (if the sun can be believed). I have almost accepted at this point that I am dreaming.

My best guess is that during my 200 backstroke, an event done entirely on your back (for those of you that are slower minded), I miscounted the number of strokes I needed to take before flipturning (that summersault thing you see swimmers doing at the olympics) and bashed my head into the wall. From there, I can assumer the poor parent volunteers and the lifeguard on duty (hopefully the hot one on the second stand) dragged me out of the pool, and there is now some poor guy, the same age as me frantically pushing on my chest, desperately forcing air in and out of my lungs, and, if I am lucky and it is the hot lifeguard, maybe he doesn’t have his rescue mask.  

If you couldn't tell, I am going a little stir crazy right now. 

  
  
  
  


1650 miles

I am absolutely, incredibly, stupid. How have I only just noticed this now? Sometime in between the beginning of my drive and 1650 miles into it, or the entire length of the United States, heading North to South, the road had, at some point, transitioned into a one way, single lane road. Which meant I was no longer on Alligator alley, and was on a different road altogether.  On top of that, while checking my appearance in the mirror, my hair is still wet. Like, fresh out of the pool wet. How wet it was when I left the Meet and got in my car. 

While staring at my still wet hair, I see something odd behind me out of my back window. I quickly flip up the sun visor and glance at my rearview mirror and my heart drops.

A figure stands on the pavement behind me, tall and twisted, its limbs too long, its eyes reflecting the red sky like the glow of distant tail lights. I blink, and suddenly it’s closer. I can’t see its face, but I **feel** it watching. I adjust the mirror, trying to convince myself I’m just sleep-deprived,even though I don't feel tired, and haven’t felt tired for several days now, and  that the thing I saw on the road was a hallucination. The sunrise—if I can even call it that—is casting long, unnatural shadows across the dashboard. My hands are gripping the wheel too tight. I force myself to breathe, to focus on the road ahead.

Then, in the mirror, something shifts.

At first, it’s just a dark blue, like a towel and equipment I forgot about in the backseat. But as the miles tick by—1001, 1020, 1400—I swear I see movement. A slow, deliberate unfurling, like something stretching after being asleep for too long. My chest tightens. I don’t want to look directly. I can’t look directly. But in the corner of my eye, just beyond the edges of the mirror, something breathes.

It's a quick puff of warm air on my ear, I immediately slam on the breaks and burst into tears. I frantically turn around, but I see nothing but the towel and folded up techsuit and bikini top I have folded in my backseat. Still, at this point I am hysterically sobbing.

 I have never been good with fear. I will go out of my way to never experience it, I avoid all rollercoasters, and I still to this day have never watched a scary movie. My only exception is that I love internet horror stories. In fact, the podcast I listen to only focuses on those reddit posts where it is either the best read of your life, or a poorly disguised PSA on internet safety. My one coping mechanism with fear is humor. So please excuse me if anything I say is very out of context. 

With tears still dripping down my face, I slam my feet on the gas pedal, determined to reach civilization. 

  
  


The engine hums beneath me, steady and indifferent, as I force my foot down on the gas. My tears have dried into a tight, itchy film on my cheeks, but my heart is still pounding hard enough that I swear I can hear it over the wind. The road stretches endlessly ahead, straight as a blade, slicing through the swamp.

I glance at the rearview mirror again, against every screaming instinct telling me not to. The backseat is still. Just the towel and my folded-up tech suit, exactly as they should be. But I know what I felt—that brief, horrifying puff of warm air against my ear, impossibly close.

“You’re losing it,” I whisper, my voice hoarse. “You’re just tired. This is a stressful dream.”

Saying it out loud does not make it true.

The odometer now reads 1,700 miles. The gas gauge hasn’t moved. The clock hasn’t moved. The road hasn’t changed. I press harder on the pedal, as though speed could somehow break whatever loop I’m caught in, but the landscape remains unnervingly the same.

That is, until I see the exit sign.

It appears like a mirage, shimmering faintly in the hot air. The green metal sign reads: “EXIT 42 - GAS & FOOD” with an arrow pointing right. The relief hits me so hard I almost sob again. I don’t care how impossible it is—I haven’t passed a single exit in over a thousand miles, and now, suddenly, here’s one.

I take it without thinking.

The ramp curves gently downward, and for the first time in what feels like forever, the road is no longer a straight line. I follow it, white-knuckling the steering wheel, praying that at the bottom of this curve there will be lights, people, noise—anything but this awful, endless quiet.

The gas station appears as though summoned. A lone Shell station, bright against the encroaching swamp, with a flickering neon “OPEN” sign in the window. I pull up to a pump, throw the car into park, and sit there for a moment, trying to remember how to breathe.

But the longer I sit, the more wrong it feels.

The gas station is too quiet. No hum of refrigerators, no distant sound of cars from the highway, no chirping of crickets or buzzing of mosquitoes. I realize with a sickening lurch that the “OPEN” sign isn’t flickering. It’s stuttering—like a bad signal, blinking in an irregular, jerky rhythm.

I glance at the rearview mirror again.

There’s a shape in the backseat.

This time, I don’t hesitate. I throw open the car door and stumble out into the thick, humid air, heart hammering against my ribs. I don’t look back at the car. I can’t. I know that if I do, I will see something I can’t explain, something I won’t be able to rationalize away with exhaustion or heat stroke or fear.

The gas station door swings open with a mechanical chime, and I step inside, desperate for human contact.

There’s a cashier standing behind the counter, a tall man with hollow cheeks and a pale, stretched smile. His eyes are too wide, too unblinking.

“Long drive?” he asks, voice smooth and slow, like syrup.

“Yeah,” I manage, my throat dry. “I… I just need directions. I think I’m lost.”

His smile widens, just a fraction too far.

“Sure thing. Where are you headed?”

“Home,” I say. “East coast.”

He doesn’t answer right away. His gaze flicks over my shoulder, toward the car. I swear I see something move in the reflection of the station’s glass door, a dark shape shifting in the backseat, waiting.

“Well,” he says, slow and thoughtful. “You’ve come a long way in the wrong direction.”

A chill crawls down my spine. How am I going in the wrong direction. Every day I have travelled I have been directly facing the sunrise. It is literally impossible for me to go anymore East then I already am.

“Yeah” I laugh nervously. I am a 17 year old girl, alone, with a creepy old man, in the middle of nowhere. I feel like some fear is excusable.

“Where am I?”

 I ask, dreading the answer.

He doesn’t blink. It's then I notice something wrong about his face, it looks just like my swim coach, who is a tried and true Florida man, only it is wrong. His beard is too unkempt, his eyes a little too small, and his nose a little too pointy. 

I stumble back a step, and for the first time, the fear I’ve been choking down rises, sharp and undeniable. I turn and bolt for the door, ignoring the cashier’s soft chuckle behind me, a sound like dry leaves scraping pavement.

I don’t look at the backseat as I climb into the car. I start the engine, slam the door, and peel out of the gas station, tires screeching against the cracked asphalt.

In the rearview mirror, I see the gas station disappear into the haze, swallowed by the swamp. But the shape in the backseat doesn’t disappear.

It’s closer now. And I know, with a cold certainty, that I am not going home.

1is5cck,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1is5cck/should_surgeons_ingest_a_significant_amount_of/,Should surgeons ingest (a significant amount of) caffeine?,"I put caffeine because many people get caffeine from other sources besides coffee. But I thought of this because there was a TikTok I saw a while back from an eye doctor/surgeon who said she only drinks decaf coffee because she has to be so precise in her operations that if her hands tremble at all it can fuck up someone's eyesight and life.

That totally made sense to me and it really stuck with me since like a year ago. I also get the hand trembling thing, and I've noticed I have way lower accuracy when typing while on caffeine. It actually motivated me to quit for like 6 months because I just thought, something that makes your hands tremble simply cannot be good for you.

But I've had this lingering question: wouldn't other doctors/surgeons also be affected by this because they have to perform very precise movements in surgeries, if they get hand trembling from caffeine? I'm not sure how common that symptom is but I feel like it's fairly common. If not other surgeons, at least other eye surgeons? And yet I've never heard this talked about before that one video on TikTok, and not since then.

Curious if anyone knows the answer: do doctors/surgeons ever curtail their caffeine consumption because of this, and if not, why? Is it ever talked about in the medical field?

I should say I have great respect for doctors and I honestly think most of them are great people for devoting their lives to helping others, and I know that their lives are often very difficult and they have to work very long hours. I want them to be happy and be able to do what they want. But this is just a question. Maybe it's an ignorant one, idk.",1,1739856388.0,decaf,4,1.0,False

My young nephew, my sister's son, had a terrifying febrile hallucination of spiders the other day. My sister, the best mother and best human being generally that I know, took such good and tender care of him.

I was already deep in the throes of a nervous episode when she called me and told me about this, so I'm not sure how helpful I was. My heart broke for both of them, really. My poor nephew. I'm so proud of my sister.

Later that same day, my son (now six) brought up a memory from when he was a toddler. An imaginary friend we had made up together -- a spider named Gregory.

It was actually a ball of hair on the bathroom floor. My son asked me if I remember Gregory, and told me how much he loves Gregory and hopes he's doing well. He told me that we should be kind to any spiders we see, because they may be Gregory's children.

It's connected. It means something, you know? It certainly does.

I thought about going to the temple today. But I decided against it. Because, I've learned to see God in so many other places.

The temple does have one advantage though-- there are so few other places where it is socially acceptable to perform dandavat pranam. There is something so deeply therapeutic about lying prostrate before God.

I actually suspect I could get away with doing so in more places, if I simply bring a Yoga mat along with me.

But, today wasn't the time for such investigations.

I went to the mall this morning before it opened. The shine seemed to be returning to the world.

The mall isn't crowded in the pre-opening hours, but it's not empty either.

Elderly couples power-walking,

a blind man tapping his cane,

a mall care-taker trimming dead leaves from a potted plant,

Hairdressers in their sleek black aprons, headed into the salon to prepare their work stations

medical staff from the nearby hospital, on a quest for coffee before their shift starts,

a man in a leather jacket sitting across from me in the lounging area, regarding me with a pensive half-smile. Possibly in a mental state similar to my own -- taking stock of and appreciating the existence of fellow human beings.

I love each of them, so much.

I truly believe there will come a day, when one by one

I remember -- that I am him. and her. and her. and them. and you.

And we all collapse back in on ourself. And find ourself again alone in the infinite void.

And take some moments of peace within the silence. And reassure ourself...that there was never any lasting harm.

And everything is okay. It was all a dream of our own creation.

And when we've sat with the silence long enough and are finally feeling rested...or bored...or driven mad yet again by the loneliness and profound solitude...

we divide ourself anew. To play the game over again.

And this cycle is infinite.

After the mall I headed to Kobayashi cafe.

The inside of the cafe is inviting and bright with little glass-top tables.

The are beautifully crafted pastries behind a glass case. The baker/barista is kind and friendly. She wears a cotton checkered apron.

There is a couch next to a table full of children's books. There is a basket for books and magazines next to each table.

Women sit at the tables drinking coffee while their co-mingled children dine on pastries and flit around the dining area. One little girl playfully pretends to eat the painted cupcake from the mural on the wall.

I ate a piece of cake. I regarded it like prasad. Because this place is sacred. And it looked a little like the sort of cake one might eat upon successfully surviving a series of Aperture Science enrichment center tests.

The cake was decadent and rich but it did not sit well with me, as it did not suit my constitution.

I tidied up my dining area and the baker thanked me emphatically making several deep gassho gestures as we made our goodbyes.

I went to the bookstore, where my old colleague -- the former school librarian now works.

I bought some pencils with ""Disappointing Affirmations"" on them, such as ""Failure is Always and Option"" and ""Unfollow Your Dreams!"" and ""Be Kind to Yourself, Asshole!"".

I had tacos with my husband for lunch and then headed to my therapist's office.

My therapist wanted me to do a somatic exercise.

It involved laying on the couch.

You always see that in the media, but you hardly ever get to do it in real life.

Laying down on an actual therapist's couch.

Iconic.

Almost as therapeutic as dandavat pranam, I think.",1,1739856031.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

I'm a 45 yo woman and about four years ago I started having ""spells"". After excercise (yoga initially) I would experience being conscious but not able to make my body move- not paralysed but like my brain and body were disconnected. 

I would be driving home and not know the lights had changed, or drive on the wrong side of the road. After the gym I would get home and not be able to get out of the car- when I finally would make it out of the car it would take ages to make myself get in the house. 

These spells would last anywhere from 20 minutes to two days. 

I saw a neurologist as I thought maybe they were seizures or silent migraines, but an MRI was all clear. The spells didn't respond to migraine medication. 

I started having the spells just from stress once I cut out vigorous excercise, coffee and alcohol. 

I had my heart checked and was told it's very healthy, though I normally have low blood pressure. 

My GP suggested maybe it was psychological as I'd suddenly (2 years in) started having panic attacks as well. 

The Psychiatrist I saw said it sounded neurological ( and that my experience of the spells was causing the panic attacks) so I am back where I started. 

In light of my age and the panic attacks I went on HRT and Desvenlafaxine, but I still get the spells from time to time with no clear reason other than maybe stress. 

When I'm having a spell I have tried taking Ativan and Seroquel, which has no effect other than helping me sleep through the spell. 

Long periods go between spells with a two day spell in August last year and another two day one in January just gone. 

When I was exercising intensely they were more frequent, up to twice a month. 

I am now scared to do things I used to enjoy for fear of having a spell and being unable to work, look after my kids, or risk crashing my car. Any ideas?

Coffee noob here. Recently bought a new espresso machine and trying to understand which grinder to get.

So far I have narrowed it down to DF54 and Baratza ESP because I want to keep it under $250 max. 

Based on what I see, the cleaning for the DF seems quite time consuming with all the unscrewing and aligning etc compared to the ESP. The ESP seems much easier to clean.

My question mainly is, is this a valid concern, if I use bellows properly and run a brush under the chute regularly? How often do I need to do this full deep cleanup? 

Based on online comments/reviews, the DF produces much better espresso (not sure if I have the palate for discerning that) but is the cleanup/maintenance trade off worth it for someone like me?

Our vibes match a lot! Shared interests, similar cultural background. I haven’t really met anyone this compatible on the apps yet. 

After our initial bonding for almost 3 weeks he tells me he is 5 years younger than what he put on his profile and how now he thinks our age difference is too large for him to have a potential serious relationship. 

For context he is 19 and I am 30!

This came as a shocker for me, as I didn’t knew what to make of it with this sudden request to cut the chord between us. I also need to now take into the account that this person is actually not mature, and I have to be the mature one! 

There is a real connection between us which is hard to deny.

So now I am asking here, do you think this 11 year age difference could even work out? I have no issue with it personally, as I would have still swiped if he was older than me tbh. 

Maybe I need to smell the coffee and accept that it’s fated to not work and move on? I basically have been ghosting everyone else I matched with on Tinder ever since I became serious for him, he as well deleted his Tinder. 

Gay dating has been too extreme for me so far! There are so many different characters and scenarios which I did not experience while I was dating women.

Any advice regarding this would be appreciated!

I posted last week about what seemed to me to be a slightly crazy offer of day old boiled crawfish by this coffee shop.

https://www.reddit.com/r/toogoodtogo/s/Zs5elfelcr

Upon reflection & per many of your’s opinion, I realized perhaps it wasn’t that awful of a thing to offer out.  So when they posted again on Saturday after having another boil on Friday night I went ahead & pulled the trigger since I needed some lunch anyway.
They gave me 2.7lbs of 🦞 & since they were out of potatoes & corn they threw in a banana pudding. 😁 awesome of them to do that.
From my experience, at restaurants that serve crawfish, 1 lb starts at $11.  So this is a solid value.
I went ahead & ate it cold because I just couldn’t bring myself to reheat it in the microwave.. maybe I’m weird but that just felt wrong.  It was good.  Definitely a very well seasoned boil.  Sitting & eating crawfish alone is kind of lame though.  It is a very communal food so for that reason I’d doubt I’d do it again unless I had a buddy down to get some too.
So, no regrets!

There are two types of kits, one is a stainless steel pod with aluminum covers that you replace when you use it so that the water can go through the top. The second kind of kit is the one that cuts off the foil of the pods you typically use then replaces the aluminum bit where the water comes in.

Each of these factions are similar in many ways both have their pros and cons. 

Old money runs deep in both Factions but both have had different agendas. At one point or another they found ways to manipulate the system to their benefit. since the beginning one faction ruled with an iron fist. and by doing so it teeter totterer the very definition of what this Subreddit is all about.

and as the Mafia grew it learned that money talks and anyone can be bought.... and with that being said their faction became a reality. Unfortunately this was not very cost effective because the more they spent to re-coop what they lost the more they spend falling short to break even.

But as time passed and the nation grew enemies became allies and allies became partners. With a country built by immigrants Old Money slowly became obsolete. Now Corruption grew 100% across the board both factions playing by dirty rules taking each other out at any cost. And anyone that stood in their way payed a price...historically that price just happened to be their life.

Now both sides had their appeal the Mafia gave you what you wanted as long as you payed your respect. And Old Money kept you safe from foreign hostile take over.

Somewhere along the way each Faction switch spots for a second making it hard to tell the difference between each group. 

One Faction created an organization to watch over the other and later down the road the other Faction followed suit.... kinda like a game of chess. knight for knight pawn for pawn.

As time moved on each faction lost their pieces to the other side.... for one reason or another. and before people can wake up to smell the coffee each side uses all the tricks they have learned like a magician to use their slight of hand to bedazzle the masses and when that starts to wear off they go back into their bag of tricks and found other creative ways to distract you while pushing their agendas.... Basically they stay wealthy and safe from harms way while the masses feel like they are doing their due diligence by protecting what we falsely believe to be acceptable.

now both factions know the masses are just sheep although we don't see it that way history tells a different story. 

We fight their wars for their personal gain the hide in plain sight like a family tree you can trace back their heritage to what faction they initially started in. they made sure that history doesn't teach you to think for yourself... Instead they force and change education all together to feed their agendas making mindless zombies out of the lot of us. as previously stated they both have their pro's and con's and they both seem to be identical in every fashion of the word.

So what side would you pick? Old Money or the Mafia.

Hi I realized after writing the first part that I will have to separate this as I’m currently not so young anymore but just barely getting around to writing it all down with the help of some coffee.  I still don’t know why but I guess if I’m being honest “curiosity”.  so even if they are all uploaded at the same time I’ve slowly been writing this for over several years as things happened. I don’t know if this makes me a writer or just a big procrastinator. I’ll go with writer for now. 





When me and my parents moved to this new Small town in Texas I had just began High school as a timeline reference .My “SP” experiences in the beginning started off with the sense of “SIGHT” only seeing these things that I didn’t know what to call other than demons who made me lose sleep.  I’ve never seen nothing sitting on my chest, nor a man with a hat, nor any clear faces or other similar things I’ve read by others accounts.  When I had these, I’ll call them “Experiences” I would usually shut my eyes and If it got too real, no actually that’s a lie I would ALWAYS shut my eyes Except only to get a glimpse. I Wasn’t exactly brimming with courage. I don’t really know how long these episodes lasted in real time, but I do know that they felt  little too long in my opinion. After a while of these just as I was kinda getting accustomed to nights when I had them. But then again I wouldn’t be writing this if this was all that happened. One night during the “experience' I could feel “it” grab my legs, And here began the marvelous gift of “TOUCH”  I could feel myself being dragged out of bed some nights, I could feel the blanket brush up against my body as I was being dragged I could feel everything and I unlike before when I would just wait for it to end, I was Fighting for my life during these times trying to move my body.  I did a lot of research After this first encounter. I figured I may not be able to stop them from happening but maybe there was tricks to waking up faster. But through my deep dive on the internet I found out that there was absolutely nothing helpful. You cannot predict them, they can’t be tested and I wasn’t old enough to drink until I blacked out. but I did  read something about moving your fingertips so I began to do that. It was always random when I had these episodes, but it was usually a 1-3 times a week, and eventually I learned to wake myself from it quite efficiently. I would bend my fingertips slowly and than fast than movement would travel to my hand, and then eventually my body would wake up and everything will go back to normal, but I did learn that if I had gone back to sleep right after an episode, I would only enter it right back again I would usually wait for a few minutes to half an hour to an hour before I went back to bed. I got so good at this, that eventually under the right circumstances I could put myself in this sleep paralysis episode on purpose, certain nights if I really wanted to but of course I can count the times I did this in one hand. this happened for the majority of high school until one day, even though I knew how to stop it, and I knew how to put myself in it. I figured there must be a way to stop it entirely so with the theory in mind that when you have a nightmare, if you face your monsters, the monsters go away, I went into school that day with a mission that tonight I would purposely put myself on their sleep paralysis and not be afraid and fight back whatever this thing was, that’s been following me and frightening me all these nights that day at school felt like I was on auto pilot. All I could think about was all the things I would say to it. I Had a list of curse words I was just itching to shoot at it, as I kept thinking that day as to why the hell I hadn’t done this sooner I  only began to get angrier and angrier on myself for being such a bitch. And just like always school ended, and I went home with conviction building on top of another. Night  eventually came, I laid in my bed and stared in the darkness with a smile in my Face I spoke in the darkness, hoping that if it was there to hear me. I remember telling it “that I would no longer be afraid of you, that I would fight back, and  that I hope to see you again tonight” (Part2/4)",1,1739854944.0,Sleepparalysis,0,1.0,False

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ies40z/aita_for_kicking_out_my_moms_boyfriend/)**: January 31, 2025**

When I was 17 my mom came into money. She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad’s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister’s college and set up funds for mine. She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house.

Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn’t pay anything but he did work.

When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn’t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it. She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed.

Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey.

For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven’t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid.

He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for. Until his current partner. She’s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit.

I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom’s past relationship as an adult was pathetic.

I hollered for my mom’s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn’t know what he current thing thought but I wasn’t going to be disrespected in my house. He wouldn’t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just “being kind” letting me stay.

First that isn’t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can. He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn’t that’s on him.

I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn’t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week).

I really feel like my mom didn’t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: If it happened exactly how you said, you’re not the asshole.

If she did say he had time to save, but would need to look for his own place, that means she never imagined or wanted him staying for long. So you’re breaking no promises.

Did she leave him any money or assets? It’s totally possible that your mother would be livid if she knew her boyfriend was still living with her son after 4 years.

>**OOP:** No she created a fund for his son for his college but that was the only money set aside for him or his son. It’s a generous amount enough for 4 years at a high dollar school. Anything not used for school will be given to him on his 25th birthday from what I believe she told me (a lawyer and accountant are in charge of those funds not me or my sister so I only know what she told us before she died).  
She was never married to or even engaged to her boyfriend. He lived with his sister and was saving for his own house when mom met him. Him moving in with us was supposed to be temporary and allow him to save to buy his dream home but he never left. My mom was like that though-she had a big heart and sometimes people took advantage of that (especially after the money). She bought him a brand new truck when his car broke down but beyond that and smaller gifts (like tv computer etc for birthdays and holiday gifts) she did not leave him money. They had no joint accounts my mom paid everything and he was supposed to be saving for a house the whole time they were together.

Commenter: Guessing to the Miss Thangs over the years he's lived rent/utility-free in OP's house. 

I'm also giving the stink eye to the sister laying the guilt-trip on OP for evicting him. 

>**OOP:** I don’t think my sister meant any harm. Probably feels a little sad like me that his son won’t be around. I don’t expect we will get to visit with the kid (he’s 15) and we both like him and have known him awhile. The three of us gamed together some over the years and usually did an outing once every month or two to arcades or amusement parks or something like that together.

Commenter: \[...\] I'm curious just how long your sister thinks he & son should be allowed to freeload off you. She doesn't have the warm fuzzies for him, does she? 

>**OOP:** No but she’s kind of a pushover like our mom was. Super kind hearted but to a fault. Heck maybe I am to, to an extent. I just don’t put up with disrespect.

Commenter: Was his gf shocked and believed him or was she trying to start the take over or at least try to? It's possible he lied to her but it's also possible she knew but was wanting to come in and take over it happens all the time. I would hire movers if they left anything do not let them back in it could be hell getting them out. Lucky they left

>**OOP:** She seemed smug the whole time so I suspect she put him up to it because he and I always got along before this. He didn’t argue when I kicked him out. He did text me and asked to come by this weekend to get his stuff and asked if I would be willing to talk. I told him my dad and boyfriend will be here and he agreed to that.  
*How gf reacted when she found out:*  
She sat with her arms crossed when he and I talked but she didn’t say anything else she left with him.

*OOP responds to a longer* [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ies40z/comment/maalol5/):

>Thank you so much. My mom was the sweetest person and when I was a teenager I feel like I was a nightmare to her. I am thankful I was much better in my late teens and 20&21 so she got to see me mature a little before she passed. I wasn’t always the best daughter but she was always the best mom.  
I think part of letting him stay so long is having bonded with his son but also I liked having someone else around who loved my mom too. There were nights I would wake up from a nightmare and end up in the kitchen and he would hear me and just come make a cup of coffee and sit and share a story about her. His son loved mom too and some evenings we would get takeout and watch movies and joke about what commentary my mom would have had if she had seen the movie with us. My sister lives a state away so we only really see each other once a month or so. I liked not being alone in this big house.  
I do have a security system and the locks have been changed. He is coming over tomorrow to get his stuff.

*To a detailed* [accusation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ies40z/comment/madh14r/) *that this is a creative writing prompt:*

>Neither me nor my sister were teenagers when my mom passed away. I was the youngest at 21. And the funds have been in a trust but it wasn’t related to this story and the character limit made me already limit things I said. I won’t have full access to the funds left to me until I am 30 but I can request additional access through the trustees and I get monthly funds for bills and spending (my mom paid for people to manage both me, my sister’s, and her boyfriend’s sons trust (yes his college fund is in a trust as well thus why his dad has no access to it).  
Personally I love Reddit this is a throwaway because I don’t want to dox myself and my actual account has photos of myself and my pets. But no one in my real life knows about the money except family and my mom’s boyfriend doesn’t even know how much money just that there was money (not even my boyfriend knows).  
Edit to add: journey was my mom’s words to her boyfriend when we all sat down, which is why I used that word. She was super into historical fiction romance novels and she used some old phrasing in real life sometimes because of it. My sister and I used to tease her for it all the time.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ifedil/update_aita_for_kicking_out_my_moms_boyfriend/)**: February 1, 2025 (Next Day)**

I know the other sub is very subjective on updates so I figured I would post it here.

I do want to take a moment to address some things I saw in the comment.

1-there are trusts set up and neither me nor my sister has full access to the money left us. This was done both because my sister and I were in our early 20s when my mom died and she wanted to make sure we had some stability before we had access and to protect us from people who may try to take advantage especially while we were grieving.

2-I have a lawyer. He has already informed me legally to my area what eviction laws are and my mom’s former boyfriend will be served with formal eviction papers just to cover myself even after today.

So to the update:

My dad came over (decided not to have my boyfriend over since he doesn’t know about the money side and I wasn’t trying to have the boyfriend out the situation) this morning and brought along my cousin. For easier telling I’m going to call mom’s former boyfriend Chuck.

Chuck showed up about 10am my time and talked to my dad then asked if he could have a couple of minutes alone with me. Dad nodded so my cousin and him went into the kitchen and Chuck and I sat in the living room.

I’ll be honest I didn’t expect it to go as it had but I am glad it did. Chuck started with an apology. I don’t remember all of the words said but the basics were he missed my mom, he has been lonely but not alone thanks to me and his son. He was sorry for what had happened that he got caught up in lust and let someone else fill his head with ideas and that he owned up to his mistakes and should have never put up with someone who would disrespect me or my mom’s memory.

He tried to hand me a cashier’s check for 15000 dollars. He said it wasn’t much but he wanted me to know he appreciated me and living with me and that he wanted to pay back some of what he owed. I refused the check both in part because I never wanted his money but I also don’t want to give any possible legal leg for him to stand on if this is somehow him trying to stay. I told him the first part and told him to put it towards a house.

He told me he is living with his sister but is going to look at houses with a realtor next week. He did say his son is asking about our next hang out date and said both me and my sister are welcome to arrange time with him.

After all of that my dad and cousin helped him get all the stuff out of the house that he owned (he had brought a U-Haul) and he gave me back my house keys. He apologized again and left.

Not what I expected. But it went really well and I feel a lot less like I let my mom down.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I’m just being nosey, sure, but how did the woman who thought she’s getting you kicked out of your house respond to it all? 

>**OOP:** No clue. At my house she just seemed smug and bitchy. I didn’t ask Chuck about her and honestly don’t care. My house is nice but it’s not like it’s multimillion dollars or anything.

*OOP replies to a deleted comment:*

>All of the “he is coming for your house” comments on my post kind of made me paranoid. Much happier with how he handled things even if the check made me a little paranoid too.

Commenter (downvoted): Where did all the money your mom got come from? Was it an inheritance? And about how much did she get? Seems like a lot to buy so much.....

>**OOP:** I won’t disclose any of that and it’s 100 percent irrelevant to the judgement of the topic at hand.

Previous posts on my profile I am too lazy to link.

This is probably going to be my last update unless something unexpected happens but I thought I would just give a quick update on Chuck.

So Chuck called me last week and again yesterday. He put an offer on a house and yesterday got accepted! They expected close date is early next month but I am very proud of him. I know everyone expected more drama (and honestly some of the comments had me worried) but it’s been really good.

He thanked me a lot for letting him have so much time here, offered me some money one more time for his time here which I again declined but I did offer to help him move in when the time comes (moving sucks). He put down almost half for a down payment so he definitely was saving money during his time here and I’m glad everything that happened was an encouragement for him to get into a home of his own.

I talked to his son yesterday after he got out of school we are going to play laser tag this weekend with my sister and he is excited for the new house too!",369,1739854864.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,16,0.99,False

We've talked in a group setting about dating preferences before and so I know for a fact that he prefers to be the one to ask the girl, but needs to see some kind of hint from her first before he'd ask.

Since I never really see him socially, I want to ask him to coffee just to catch up as friends, but I want him to ask me on a date at the end of the coffee chat. How do I finesse this? I want to make sure that my invitation to coffee is not interpreted as a date, while also leaving the door open so that he can see that I'm interested in being asked on a real date. But also I want to keep it casual enough that it won't be awkward to see him in the class/club for the rest of the semester.

I just set up my first couple trucks stations and a fuel station all along a little desert highway. I figured that since I've already got both unlocked, I'd go for the more advanced trucks over the clearly primitive tractors. That impression quickly changed.

After a bit of reading, I made sure to make all my lanes \~1.75 foundations wide, especially since I want to stay on-grid, meaning that all my turns are 90 degrees, which is rather sharp. Alas, it seems the trucks have the turning radius of, well, a truck. I had to slow down to a crawl to get into my u-turn style stations and even struggled with my right-angle road turns (especially the inside turns).

Following them after the route was complete was a mixture of hilarious and frustrating: I quickly lost track of the number of times they tried jumping off the highway entirely or miscalculated a turn and had to reverse (which I had not done while recording). Not to mention slowing down for seemingly no reason.

I was fed up, so I tried decided to try a tractor. And it just... worked. Almost perfectly. They pretty much maintain top speed all along the route and never seem to struggle with my setup.

Anyway, rant aside, I do have some questions for everyone here:

1. I've read that your speed while recording a route doesn't matter, as long as you don't have any extraneous ""pause symbols."" Is that right? I just still can't figure out why my trucks were often slowing down randomly on long straightaways.
2. Do you use trucks or tractors? Why? (I know the real answer is ""I prefer trains,"" but let's save that for another discussion)
3. Has anyone been able to use trucks easily with 1.5-foundation lanes and 90-degree turns?

PS: I know that as soon as you move away, none of this matters and vehicles just sort of float along, but the whole reason I wanted vehicles is to watch them scurry about while drinking my ""coffee.""

1is4tp9,https://v.redd.it/0u4fqbatwtje1,Chirping Noise after grinding [Eureka Mignon Zero 65 All purpose],"
Got the machine around 3 weeks ago. It’s a relatively new model and not a lot of reviews. It has been great and I love it and highly recommend it. The espresso and even V60 and aeropress brewing has been awesome. 

Only issue (or question really) is related to a chirping noise when I turn the machine off (kind of like the burrs are touching but I know for sure they are definitely not). This noise only occurs when I am grinding fine for espresso. It goes it away if I go even finer and then back courser to the original dial setting (noise at 12 for example and then I go to 1 and back to 12 again the noise goes away). 

Was told by vendor that this is expected due to some small amount of retained coffee causing the noise and not to worry about it. Thought I would double check here and see if anyone has experience to explain this and if this is an issue to worry about or just let it be and move on and not worry. This has been reported by others also who have the same machine. You can hear it here (and mentioned in the video comments) on this YouTube video:

I 30F having been saying this guy 33M for 3 years now  we have recently got into an argument about money. We moved into his families house because He has debt that he is working I paid off my debt before we moved in but I am working on building up my emergency funds. He likes to go out and eat dinner or go out and drinks sometimes we go out and just get some boba. At the end of the month he adds up everything that he spends and gives me half to pay him back. This method doesn’t work for me because it catches me of guard when he wants his money (I put about 70% of my check into my savings so I only have 30% left over every two weeks). Most times I just give him half right then and there whenever we go out to eat, the only issue I am having is I usually don’t expect anything in return when I go and use my credit card on the times we go out and he usually doesn’t even pay me back. I think it’s a bit ridicules that I have to pay him back for buying me a cup of coffee. I think it’s even more ridiculous that he brings up the fact that he takes me to Bart or even drives me to work. It seems to feel like there’s always strings attached when he goes out of his pocket for me. He even blames his debt on me. Mind you he goes it and drinks when his friends and pays for them from time to time. We’re talking about marriage and I just hate that idea of “owing” my husband any type of money. I feel like.

i’m a single 24 year old labor and delivery nurse who’s moving sometime near the end of this year. i’ve known that i was gonna move out of my hometown for years and still struggle with indecisiveness and fear of making “the wrong decision”. california and new york are two places that i’ve always been interested in, and i simply cannot figure out which one to lean towards

my top priorities include: good hospitals that pay enough for life and leisure, excellent food, non-alcoholic entertainment/activities, good coffee/matcha, diversity, shopping, no regular (emphasis on regular) natural disasters or extreme weather, left leaning politics, easy to make friends, decent dating pool (i know everyone says every state is the “worst” for dating), at least average walkability, need to be able to afford to rent alone 

california

pros: excellent nursing culture, unionized hospitals, beautiful weather, access to nature, beaches, entertainment/concerts, large state with many different cities/areas i could try out, seems like there’s a lot to do

cons: very far out west from friends and family, car centric (i seriously hate driving a car), less people from my culture, expensive, i’ve never visited there so i’m very unfamiliar with a lot of things, have no clue how the people are, fear of earthquakes/fires, nursing competitiveness esp labor and delivery, car centric!! 

new york 

pros: irreplaceable unique place, always enjoy being there whenever i visit, endless activities, more people from my culture, food scene, public transit, insane diversity, closer to home, more family that live there, walkability!!! 


cons: apartment/rental culture, potential pest issues, no guaranteed in unit washer and dryer, expensive, little knowledge about l&d units there, fewer unionized hospitals compared to cali, apparently many hospitals there require one week of 4 12 hour shifts, weather sucks sometimes esp in comparison to cali, less access to nature without going to upstate ny, people say the dating is really bad (no one wants long term monogamous commitment)

which one would you choose?

1is4pgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1is4pgv/my_maui_5_day_itinerary/,My Maui 5 day Itinerary,"Me and my wife just got back from our anniversary trip to Maui and I thought I would share with this forum our itinerary since I got a lot of info from here. We got a Costco vacation package, which we had booked back in Nov for \~ $3900 (flights+hotel+rental car). Overall, the trip was great and apart from a few tourist traps and Road to Hana that I outline below, I have no regrets. It's ok if you do not agree with me, but I am just sharing my experience to help future visitors.

**Day 1 (Departure):**

1. Flew out from Portland to Maui. Got in Maui around 2 pm and waited for a good half hour before our check-in bags arrived. Took the tram to the rental car center and picked up the car from Budget Car rental.

2. Arrived at our hotel (Aston at the Whalers Village on Kaanapali) around 4 pm. Checked in and enjoyed the oceanview from our balcony. The hotel frankly was amazing. Its a condo complex where rooms are rented out and the management company checks in guests. I recommend it.

3. Went for a walk, watched the sunset and ate at Monkeypod in the Whaler's village. Ordered fries and pizza and Mai Tai.

**Day 2 (Ziplining and Wailea):**

1. Woke up to the refreshing oceanview and cool breeze. It was the best morning I ever had.

2. Tried to get the Haleakala Sunrise permit and I refreshed the site at 6:59:59 and immediately tried adding a permit to the cart. The system however couldn't get me through. In hindsight, I should have booked back in Nov but I didn't know about the permit system back then. 

3. Left at 9 am for Nakalele Blowhole and spent \~ 15-20 mins watching the blowhole and the coastline. 

4. Headed to Kapalua Ziplines and checked in. We were taken to the top of the mountain and we Ziplined for good 2h 30 mins. I loved the staff and the entire cohort. I definitely would recommend taking a go pro and filming yourself on the zipline. My wife was scared initially but then she loved as she got more comfortable with the feeling.

5. We were done with Ziplining by 2.30 pm. Got a smoothie to complement our home-made sandwich. Arrived back at the hotel and relaxed for an hour.

6. Headed to Wailea beach to watch the sunset. Sunset was awesome and very relaxing,

7. Called Lineage to see if they could get us in for dinner. The kind lady at the phone was able to get us in. The food was awesome! We ordered roasted caulifower and schezwan noodles since me and wife are vegetarians.

8. Headed back to the hotel post dinner

**Day 3 (Haleakala):**

1. Headed to Iao Valley State Park. Though we did not have the reservation, we were lucky to book it upon arrival. Kudos to the kind attendant at the counter who guided us through the reservations. We stayed there for an hour taking photos. The lush green view is nice but the entry fee is probably not worth it. So if you are short on time, this can be skipped.

2. Grabbed a smoothie from Maui tropical plantation.

3. Headed to Costco in Kahului to fuel up and local shopping. I got a pair of beach slippers, macadamia nut shortbread cookies and 100% kona coffee from Costco. Regardless of the location, I keep on falling in love with Costco!

4. We grabbed lunch from the food carts right outside the Costco and also packed for dinner since we were going to head up to the Haleakala Summit.

5. Started for Haleakala Summit around 1.30 pm and reached the summit around 3 pm with stops along the way. We hung out at the summit for \~20 mins and then headed down to the vistor's center for the Sliding Sands Trailhead.

6. Started the trail around 4 pm and I was experiencing altitude sickness and shortness of breath. I never experienced something like this before but it wasn't too bad. We did the trail for may be a mile before heading back to the trailhead. A passer-by told us that first mile is where you get the most epic views so that was good.

7. Watched the sunset from the summit. It was Super cold. Way colder than I anticipated. Please please please do not underestimate how cold it can be and carry your parka or multiple layers up there. People start to congregate at the summit \~30 mins before so its important to bring your camping chair and dig in before all good spots are taken by insta influencers. Sunset was amazing and totally worth it. 

8. Had the packed dinner at the summit and headed down around 7 pm. I wanted to wait and stargaze but my wife was worried about the night driving so we left. Still I was able to get the view of majestic night sky half way down the mountain. I strongly recommend to watch the night sky from Haleakala if possible.

**Day 4 (Gazebo, Kapalua Bay and Sunset Cruise):**

1. Got up early and went to get the breakfast at the Gazebo. We arrived there around 8.15 am and it was already an hour long line. (\~ 15 people ahead of us). I don't understand why they do not allow people to place their name in the queue and walk to the nearby beach. There are apps such as opentable that help you maintain a waitlist and most restaurants do it. But I guess, this helps them exhibit their popularity. Honestly, the food was OK and there was nothing exceptional about it. We got the famous macadamia nut pancakes and the Burrito and it was OK. IMO, not worth the hour long wait in the queue. I would possibly invite some hate for this bullet point, but I have to tell people to avoid the tourist traps such as this. 

2. After the breakfast, headed up to Kapalua Bay beach, which was awesome. The parking fee at the beach is exorbitant (whopping $29)! and they dont let you pay by the hour. You have to pay for the whole day if you want to park there. So I dropped my wife at the beach and found parking \~ 0.25 mile along the roadside.

3. Spent about an hour at the beach, swimming and relaxing. I saw people snorkeling as well but I didn't have the gear and I wasn't comfortable doing it myself so skipped that.

4. Headed back to the hotel to relax - took shower and ate leftovers from Gazebo as lunch

5. Headed to the Maalalea Harbour for the sunset cruise. It took nearly an hour to go from Kaanapali to Maalalea Harbor due to some roadwork so I would recommend to always plan for an extra cushion when planning for activities. We arrived there with barely 4 mins left for the cruise to depart, panting. The parking at the harbor is great and easy to find. The cruise itself was an overall a great experience and I recommend everyone to do it. The best part was that we saw so many humpbacks right next to us. Food and drinks were ""meh"" but I didn't expect much on that front anyway.

6. Headed back to the hotel

**Day 5 (Road to Hana):** ***Arguably the most overrated part of Maui***

1. We got up at 5 am and left our hotel by 6.30 pm. Refueled at Costco and then headed to Hokoipa beach for a brief stop. A beautiful beach IMO and I should have spent more time there in lieu of some underwhelming spots below.

2. Stopped at Twin Falls. The parking fee is steep for what the falls are ($10) and being from the PNW, I found the falls to be greatly underwhelming. I am not saying the falls are bad - just that they dont live up to the hype. I see falls like these all the time and there was nothing unique or noteworthy about  them. 

3. At first I loved the drive. Going through the corners in the sedan was fun. Stopped at the Ke'nae lookout for a few pics and then grabbed the Aunty Sandy's Banana Bread. Honestly, the bread was OK - it was warm and came fresh out of the oven but there is nothing unique about it or it that it tasted any different from what I make at home. Once again, I am not bashing on Aunty Sandy and I understand the support for small businesses, but lets not hype things out of proportion. You would not miss anything if you didn't have this bread while on Road to Hana.

4. Headed to Ke'nae arboretum. Thankfully it was free because once again unless you are a Botanist, its just another trail with different kinds of trees. There are no interesting views per se. I should have skipped it.

5. Headed to the Waianapanapa state park. I reserved the parking about 5 days before (thankfully). Walked across the black sand beach and did the trail up along the shoreline. Pretty good overall, but nothing mind blowing. It rained the whole time so we couldn't spend much time there.

6. Headed to the Pipiwai trailhead in the Haleakala National Park. This is where I started to get worn down of driving as curves get significantly sharper and road significantly worse. To add to the misery local drivers in pickup trucks often do not yield on one way roads since tourists are a nuisance to them. I strongly recommend honking multiple times near a turn because likelihood of hitting an oncoming car increase manifold.

7. Arrived at the Pipiwai trailhead around 2.30 pm and started the trail. The Bamboo forest and the banyan tree were AWESOME. This is what was unique about the trail that you cannot find elsewhere. We hiked all the way to Waimoku falls but in hindsight the falls themselves were nothing extraordinary and can be skipped. We got back to the trail head around 5 pm.

8. This is where the scary part begins - the drive back. In hindsight, I should have skipped the Twinfalls, Ke'nae and just done Waianapanapa and Pipiwai. By the time we reached Hana, it was starting to get dark and since we were driving along the cliff now, the turns appeared significantly scary. I literally just kept on honking because the local drivers are too careless (or may be they are used to it). But lots of unsafe driving was encountered along the way. This was the scariest part of the whole trip and I would never recommend someone to do it in the dark. Thankfully nothing happened and we reached Wailea around 8 pm for dinner, safe and sound!

**Day 6 (Return):** 

1. Packed our bags, did last minute shopping at the ABC store in Kaanapali and headed for the rental car drop off

2. The line at the OGG was HUGE. We waited for a good 1 hour in the line to drop off our check in bag. Honestly, the Hawaiian airlines should do a better job with staffing and streamlining the process. Security line also moved pretty slow, taking about 20 mins. By the time we reached the gate, our group # was being called so we made it just in time despite arriving at the airport 2 hours early!",17,1739854128.0,MauiVisitors,10,1.0,False

I went to therapy to discuss this issue because in reality, I never knew why the friends I made would ghost me. I can truly say I am a very good friend. I listen, I don't judge, I def do go out of my way to meet my friends needs, there were times I made sure my friends felt appreciated (gifts, nice gestures, helping them move, etc). A lot of the time (most of the time) it was never reciprocated back. I didn't mind and I never kept tabs on what they would or wouldn't do for me but when I turned 25 I just decided to stop making friends because no one showed up to my birthday party that I planned and cooked for when they said they would... I know things happen and we can't control life, but that was about the third time that year I had invited said friends to my house for a celebration and there was no one. The only people that showed up were my ex and his friends (we were dating at the time - now he's my ex) and it made me feel awful because they kept asking me what time my friends would arrive. 
I am a SAHM now with absolutely no friends. I have aquaitances that I speak to here and there and visit once every few months but no one that I can rely on or talk to...or just get out of the house and meet up for coffee. 

Is this normal after becoming a mom? 
My fiance keeps telling me how important it is for me to make friends but honestly, I have anxiety with meeting other women...quiet frankly, a lot of women are mean. I'm also a little shy - like I went to the doctor with my baby and another woman was there with her kid and she started talking to me and asking if we were from around town and she said she was kinda new. I didn't know if that was her trying to make friends or just talk ...either way, it was out of my comfort zone to make friends with a stranger. ahhh help? lol",3,1739854046.0,sahm,1,1.0,False
1is4nmx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1is4nmx,Oversized vegan bran muffins! Giving coffee shop vibes without coffee shop prices,"Breakfast prep for this week was a recipe from one of my favorite bloggers Connoiseurus Veg, with a few tweaks. Original recipe with pics here: 
https://www.connoisseurusveg.com/vegan-bran-muffins/#recipe

The original recipe is fantastic and I highly recommend it, but I wanted huge muffins so I added some extra baking powder, and I swapped a little bit of the plant milk for molasses.

**Ingredients**

* 1 ½ cups whole wheat flour
* 1 cup wheat bran
* ⅔ cup organic brown sugar
* 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon ground ginger
* ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 cup unflavored and unsweetened plant milk
* ¼ cup molasses
* ⅓ cup vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ¾ cup raisins (optional)


**Instructions**

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F and prepare your muffin tin.
2. Mix the dry ingredients (flour, bran, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt) in a large mixing bowl.
3. In a separate container stir together the wet ingredients (milk, oil, vinegar, molasses and vanilla.)
4. Pour the milk mixture into the bowl with the flour mixture. Stir the ingredients together just until blended. Don't overmix the batter.
5. Fold in the raisins if using.
6. Divide the batter among the muffin cups and bake the muffins for about 20 minutes, or until slightly darkened and domed on top. To test for doneness, gently press a finger into the top of a muffin. It will spiring back if the muffin is done.

1is4kxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1is4kxk/force_shutdown_iphone_11/,Force shutdown ? Iphone 11,"So i accidentally spilt coffee all over my phone a few days ago. I immediately turned it off and wiped it down to the best of my abilities bc I was not at home at the time. I left it off and left it standing upright for about 2 days or so, put it in rice yesterday and left it overnight. I had to turn it om (begrudgingly) because I need it for work and also need access to my banking apps. I feel so stupid now because the screen is filled with colored lines and I can't see past anything to turn it off. I can't access the sliding turn off button or even settings. 

It is currently still on and I left it on my table. At least it isn't turning hot but I am afraid of keeping it on due to it being a potential safety hazard bc of the damage. It's currently midnight where I am so I can't even bring it to a repair/tech shop or any place that might help me. I do not care about getting it fixed which I know this sub is meant for but I do not know where else to turn to for advice.

It doesn't have much charge so I'm hoping it dies quickly, but I am wondering if there is anything I can do to turn it off sooner rather than waiting and hoping it dies?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Now, to make the story short we were best friends since 9th grade, I cut her off for personal and wrong reasons in our last year of high-school (she did nothing wrong, I was just being an ass), we got back in touch like a year after finishing HS (6 months ago) and went out for coffee, and have since texted twice: last November when I congratulated her on her birthday, and a month ago when I gave her my new number.

A few days ago an ex-classmate texted me to my new number. I had not given it to anybody else from our hometown, so I obviously knew she had given it to him. Honestly, it's not even a problem, I was prepared for that to happen when I gave it to her and it's not like I'm trying to hide, so tbh I don't care. I texted her asking if she had give him my number and she said yes, but there is something that rubs me the wrong way about her reply, I'll write it here verbatim: ""Hi yes I'm sorry, I should've asked you first, I understand if you're angry. He sent me a dm on Instagram asking me if I knew anything from you because he had sent you a text and it wouldn't deliver or I don't know what"". I replied telling her not to worry and that I didn't mind, I was just curious as to how he got my number. She never replied back.

So, the thing is, idk if I'm just being dramatic or paranoid, but I feel like the text feels impersonal or removed: the line ""I understand if you're angry"" just feels like she doesn't really care if I'm angry and perhaps knew there was a chance I'd be angry and she didn't care, like she thought she'd be crossing a line and she still decided to do it and now is just resigned and not really bothered by me possibly being angry. And then the not answering? Again, it's like she didn't care in the first place and is indifferent to me saying it's ok. And ok, typing this I see how I could come off as crazy, but idk, she's the type of person to apologise 1000 times for the most minor offences and make sure everything is really 100% ok over and over. And maybe she's changed and is not so much of a people pleaser anymore, maybe she was busy, idk, but please tell me, am I overreacting? Reading too much into it? Or does she really not care?

Also, when I gave her my number she said we should go out for coffee again when I'm back in town (I go to college in a different state), was that just a nicety then? 

Btw, I have another post on my profile on her and it's got more context on everything, if you're interested.",1,1739852857.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I love my Breville Barista Pro, enjoy my daily coffee (or coffees :-)) and want to give it some TLC once in a while. Now this is where I’m encountering an issue. I was hoping someone here might have advice or has dealt with a similar problem.

The problem seems to be during the backflush cleaning cycle with the rubber cleaning disc that’s supposed to block water flow through the portafilter. When I insert it into the filter basket (using the single-wall basket), water still partially flows through the portafilter spouts instead of being redirected back into the drip tray. Is it because it doesn’t fully seat at the bottom? There’s some air trapped between the rubber disc and the bottom of the basket, creating a sort of cushion effect. Not sure if this is a problem a such.

I’m using the cleaning disc that came with the machine. I have not used it that much, so it is still in good as new condition. I Press the disc down as much as possible to try and eliminate trapped air before locking the portafilter into place. Tried several things, but for sure I am doing something wrong. 

I suspect that the trapped air is preventing a proper seal, but I’m not sure if this is a common problem or if there’s another solution I’m missing. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how did you fix it? Thanks in advance for your help!",1,1739852617.0,breville,0,1.0,False

edit: i appreciate the concerns and advice. to clarify i rarely (if ever at all) have ultra processed packaged food products in my regular diet so i don't think it would be that but now that i think about it, dehydration might be a possibility, another potential factor i didn't mention is that i am an athlete (so a lot of sweating) and also live in a tropical area. and so perhaps those could be some of the reasons why i occasionally impulsively lick the salt lamp in my room ",8,1739852389.0,Cooking,32,0.6,False

with tiktok and ig reels, short form content makes it SO easy to convey a facade of whatever version of their life they want the viewer to see. i could go on for hours about lexi falls into this, but i think why her page specifically feels so toxic is because most of her following (young impressionable girls) don’t see the damage she’s causing. the paws for a moment “meet and greet”, the constant bombarding content of her “perfect” relationship, the constant traveling, “lifestyle” content of her going to the beach and drinking coffee like that’s a normal daily routine. it’s a long list of almost subliminal messages maybe she doesn’t even realize she’s posting about. 

content creators like lexi contribute to this epidemic that lead people to believe it’s normal to constantly travel, buy everything they want just because they want it, own multiple houses, live in a vacation destination. IT IS NOT NORMAL!! there’s nothing necessarily wrong with those things alone, but incessantly posting about those things like they’re normal and flipping it with a message about “practicing gratitude” is where it becomes toxic. 95% of the population doesn’t and will never have those luxuries. they work full time jobs, sometimes 2+ jobs to pay their bills, their closet doesn’t look like hers, their bedroom window view doesn’t look like hers, their LIFE doesn’t look like hers and it leads to a downward spiral of comparison and ultimately disappointment. i found myself down this path personally until i had a wake up call on how fake these influencers “perfect lives” actually are.

anyway, sorry for the long rant but it just makes me so sad that these are the creators people idolize when there are so many smaller influencers out their who promote more normal, healthy, and positive content. ",8,1739852210.0,LexiHidalgosnark,0,0.91,False
