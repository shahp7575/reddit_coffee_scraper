You never expect life-changing moments to happen while buying something off Marketplace‚Äîbut sometimes, the universe surprises you. I met someone recently while picking up an item, she was around my age (38) had kids, single and from what I could tell, was about ready to move houses. Anyhow, what should have been a simple exchange turned into one of the most effortless, genuine conversations I‚Äôve ever had.

From the moment we spoke, it felt like we had known each other forever. The way the conversation flowed, the way she carried herself‚Äîeverything about her was so incredible. She was smart, kind, and had this natural warmth that made it impossible to walk away. And her accent? Absolutely mesmerizing.

It wasn‚Äôt just about attraction; it was about connection. The kind you don‚Äôt come across often, the kind that makes time stand still. When we finally parted ways, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I had just met someone truly special.

If fate ever allows me to run into her again, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate this time. No overthinking, no missed opportunity‚ÄîI‚Äôd 100% ask her out for coffee. Because some connections are too rare to let slip away.

Why am I telling Brisbane this? 

Good question! Maybe I‚Äôm putting it out there as a way to process the moment‚Äîsometimes, writing about something helps solidify how much it means to you. Or maybe, deep down, I‚Äôm hoping the universe (or the internet) works its magic, and somehow this story finds its way back to her.

Or maybe, it‚Äôs just one of those moments too good not to share‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a story about an unexpected connection?

Here‚Äôs to hoping the universe isn‚Äôt done surprising me just yet.

Hey there

Allow me to introduce myself‚ÄîI am a reserved yet passionate introvert, seeking to embark on a journey of meaningful connections and friendships. As I navigate this vast world, I have come to realize that life's true beauty lies in forging genuine bonds with like-minded individuals. Today, I take a leap of faith to reach out to this incredible community, in the hopes of finding some amazing female friends to share laughter, stories, and moments of deep understanding.

For me, the essence of friendship transcends the boundaries of small talk and shallow interactions. I yearn for connections that delve into the depths of our shared interests, dreams, and quirks. Though I may not be the loudest voice in a crowd, my heart carries the weight of empathy and compassion, making me a keen listener and a steadfast confidant. From the solace of a quiet coffee shop to the thrill of a thrilling book, I find solace in the simplicity of life's little wonders.

In a world that often glorifies extroversion, I firmly believe that introverts hold the power to nurture profound connections. There's something truly magical about the authenticity that arises when two introverted souls come together in understanding and harmony.

If you resonate with the idea of finding a friend who embraces the beauty of solitude and shares the joy of deep conversations, then I wholeheartedly invite you to join me on this journey. Let's explore the wonders of the universe through the lens of our unique perspectives and build a bond that defies the constraints of time and space.

Together, let's create a little corner of the world where introversion blooms and where friendship knows no boundaries. I eagerly await the opportunity to meet some incredible like-minded souls who can share in life's ups and downs, triumphs and tribulations, and everything in between.

Looking forward to connecting with you

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

[Sage Bambino/DF64 Gen 2],"I've been having problems with sour espresso ever since I got my Sage Bambino, so I thought I'd try a salami shot to make sure it wasn't just my perception of sour/bitter. The first 1/5 of the shot out of my machine was absolutely undrinkable and it was the same bad taste I was getting in the cup of my espresso The second pour was really good and was the taste I've been after, which only made it more frustrating. After doing some more playing around and watching other videos, I noticed good espresso normally slowly bunches up on the bottomless portafilter before dripping through. I feel mine rushes out, then slowly starts coming out as it should. I know I know, grind finer, but I'm already at the 30-35 second range and I start my timer at first drop, not during pre-infusion. Just wondering if anybody else has noticed this on the standard Bambino and whether it's just an issue of the machine or whether I could be doing something to fix it.

Workflow is blank shot with pressurised basket, 18g of coffee, RDT, grind in DF64 Gen 2, transfer to Normcore bottomless portafilter, WDT, tap portafilter on counter, Normcore Spring Tamper, puck screen, load portafilter into Bambino, hold double shot button until preinfusion stops, start timer, stop pour around 32g to allow for drips.

When extracting, my bottomless portafilter looks like giraffe patches and has some very occasional tiny spurts.

Setup: Flair 58, Eureka Mignon Notte/Manuale, VST 15g basket, Normcore self-levelling tamper, standard WDT tool.

My routine/recipe:

1. 16g dose of coffee (because I read that VST baskets allow for 1g+- variance)- my usual dose coming from flair pro 2.
2. RDT and mixing around with a teaspoon to distribute the droplets
3. WDT starting from the bottom of the basket and working my way up
4. Knock the portafilter once or twice to settle the grounds then tamping twice firmly with normcore v4 self-levelling tamper

I have tried:

\- to purge my grinder with 6g of coffee every time I change a grind setting  
\- grind much coarser, channeling is still the same if not worse  
\- not to RDT because I thought that the water might cause clumping to no avail  
\- to tamp with less force (not sure how relevant this is as I've seen many people have conflicting takes on whether this matters)  
\- to use blind shaker without wdt and then tamp to no avail  
\- pre-infusion for about 10-15s to no avail (the pre-infusion stage looks normal until I ramp up the pressure)  
\- to use the stock flair basket and for some reason the channeling is 2X worse  
\- wetting the puck screen first and trying a different puck screen (normcore 0.8mm) to no avail  
\- to use 15g dosage to match the 15g VST basket with a much finer grind setting (which has shown only very minor improvements)

At this point what else am I missing? I'm starting to get a bit frustrated because I've wasted a lot of coffee at this point and while I love the workflow of the 58 I'm really starting to regret the upgrade. Though its not the end of the world as the coffee is still drinkable but with very obvious hints of overextraction and astringency. I'm starting to think its a problem with the grinder but it doesn't make much sense since this grinder is only 1 month old. The only thing left I can think of is to manually open up the grinder and re-aligning the burrs but I'm a rookie and there will be a huge risk of me not knowing what I'm doing and making the grinder worse than it is now.

And it smells good too, like a bath bomb"" She puts the cookie up to my face for me to sniff and I smell it and say ""Yeah, you're right (slightly disagreeing that it smells like a bath bomb"" and she shoves the rest of it in her mouth, looks at me and says ""Yeah.

A couple weeks after that, we shared a shift in the morning, I was struggling to mask around her cus I was tired and feeling asocial, I even thought she was a bit put off by me cus of how stressed I felt, but, when we were in the staff room, she walked out to do something and said bye like she always does when she ends a conversation with me (and if I don't say bye back she gets slightly offended lol) so I said bye back and made me and her two cups of coffee, she came in and saw me making us both coffees and said ""Wow, thank you"" (sounding a bit shocked), she then checked the staff room fridge and said ""Aw, no milk, I'll have to buy myself a coffee"" and I said ""Are you sure"" (knowing there was milk) and she was like ""Yeah, it's fine. Just use my mug instead. See ya in a bit"" She walks out and, honestly, the way she told me to use her pink mug instead of the other mug (a weird Mickey Mouse one), I was kind of turned on honestly, so I used hers, took it down stairs and left it on a shelf while I was filling the fridges with drinks and she came back, I asked her if she bought herself a coffee and she just said ""Noooo"" without further explanation, I thought that was weird but we continued to have a great time together before the shop opened and she said ""Ooohhh, today's gonna be a good day, I can feel it"" and I agreed cus I got to spend time with her and I think she felt the same way cus she's said that before whenever we have a laugh at the start of our shifts. Once we opened, we just chilled and laughed together some more while working on the tills and when our manager came in (she's a supervisor btw) she went away from the tills and said ""Byyyee. Don't worry, I'll be back in a bit"" bruh my heart was fluttering so early in the morning, maybe it had something to do with the coffee too lol",1,1743154220.0,Obsessive_Love,0,1.0,False

I use the Samsung Health app to keep track of my diet and steps. It works well, I just hate doing it.

I had gotten down to 190 lbs (5'9) but I'm back up to 200 lbs. My goal is maintaining 180 lbs. I'm eating 1600 calories a day (approved by my doctor) and I'm on a low dose of Ozempic.

I get my A1C checked soon and I hope all this calorie counting is worth it.

I'm disabled so hard exercise is impossible for me. I can only maintain my weight with diet. I hate it.

It's not even that I hate eating less, I just hate trying to cram all the vitamins and nutrients I need into 1600 calories. Every meal has to be so jam packed. My coffees have become protein fiber shakes backed with electrolytes and fruits and greens and its exhausting. I made black bean brownies just to get more fiber into my diet. Delicious actually, but omg can I just not worry about my diet for one day???

Sometimes I straight up speed eat a handful of leafy greens or chia seeds just to meet my nutrient needs.

I'm so tired of it.

I'm 31 and have always struggled with my weight. Type 2 diabetes and disability have made everything so much harder.

And there it is ‚Äî another goddamn verdict. Friend-zoned. Again. Over a decade of this now, but the solitude? Feels like an eternity ‚Äî plus a couple of extra days, just so fate can drag it out for a few more laughs and take another cheap shot at a guy already down. I‚Äôm floating through some unknown realm, void of light, something sharp and excruciating burrowing into my bones, gnawing deeper, waiting to break through. And I keep fending it off ‚Äî but for the love of God, I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can. Welcome to Twenty-Eight. And no, the world is not my freaking oyster. More like a Ferris wheel in reverse, picking up speed, gears grinding, ready to fling me off at any second. Fell for someone again ‚Äî third time now. Somehow worse than the last two. She smiles, all pity and politeness, and fist-bumps me like I‚Äôm just another dude in the line-up. That‚Äôs all my expectations amount to now. Guess I‚Äôll see where this spinning wheel flings me. 

Fucking Gabriella. Or Gaby, for short. Naturally, I can‚Äôt get her out of my damn head. It‚Äôs not every day you meet a girl like that ‚Äî ridiculously attractive, a smile sculpted from pure exuberance, and a taste for music that leans toward the heavy and cathartic. She gets off on listening to Tool and Slipknot, has watched everything from Citizen Kane to Snatch and the entire Star Wars saga, and somehow still finds time to rescue stray cats ‚Äî bestowing them with names like Avocato and Obi-Wan Catnobi. And to top it off, she runs a cozy little restaurant in one of my favourite corners of the city ‚Äî not fancy, but always packed with loyal customers swearing by her ramen, Japanese onigiri, sushi, and Korean kimbap. A daily Pan-Asian feast that keeps them coming back for more. But it‚Äôs not just about the food. It‚Äôs the way she talks to her customers from behind the counter ‚Äî an effortless warmth in those fleeting interactions that makes even strangers feel at home. At least, that‚Äôs what it did for me the first time I walked in. A five-minute conversation at best, yet somehow, it felt like we‚Äôd already said everything that mattered. For a second, the whole place seemed to pause ‚Äî hell, maybe even the broth stopped boiling, and the sushi stopped rolling. ‚ÄúHouston, Tranquillity Base here, the Eagle has landed.‚Äù And for a moment, standing there, I actually believed it. There‚Äôs also something effortlessly captivating About a woman who waltzes through her day powered by an ungodly yet affectionate fusion of black coffee and cigarettes ‚Äî without a shred of apology. How could a dysfunctional, vapid creature like me not be drawn to that? Maybe I was slightly inspired. Maybe I never stood a chance. I was taken ‚Äî mind adrift like a rogue star, tearing through supernovas, gallivanting across galaxies, searching for a way to fit into her world. To be welcomed into it. But I get too carried away. I have to remind myself that the grains of devastation drift and linger in the wind, just waiting for an event like this to blow in my direction. And I can only hope it‚Äôs brutal enough this time to push me into joining some kind of dojo ‚Äî one with an unforgiving training regimen where I get kicked in the face enough times to keep my mind too disjointed to dwell on this whole charade. This isn‚Äôt even an extreme thought. It‚Äôs just standard procedure for a guy in his late twenties ‚Äî managing expectations, allowing the universe‚Äôs soft whisper of rejection to really sink in. 

So here I am. A couple of days and a whole eon‚Äôs worth of dread and contemplation pass, and now I‚Äôm here ‚Äî sitting on a finely polished mat of an MMA dojo. Anxious, but more exasperated than anything. Silently counting down the moments until my first lesson begins. Turns out she was seeing someone all along. Shocker. There‚Äôs always a bitter catch with these things. Sometimes it‚Äôs subtle, buried beneath playful smiles and vague ‚Äúlet‚Äôs keep it platonic‚Äù disclaimers. Other times, it‚Äôs right there in your face. But when you‚Äôre knee-deep in the cesspool of one-sided emotional leanings, you don‚Äôt see it ‚Äî at least not when it matters. To hell with it. Let the infliction of unrelenting pain through a well-placed kick to the ribs or a tight rear-naked chokehold fix my wandering thoughts. I welcome it. I‚Äôd dance with it all day if it meant pulling away from wanting something beyond my grasp. Maybe, somehow, trudging forward Painful as it may be ‚Äî is the only thing that keeps me from drifting back into old comforts. As a kid, running barefoot on forgotten beaches toward the waves felt natural, effortless. But at some point, staying in a place long abandoned stops being an escape. This time, I‚Äôll climb out of the quiet trenches and move toward the brute force of adversity so I can confront it head-on ‚Äî rescue myself from drowning in the same waves I used to chase with an almost electric impulse. Plus, a couple of shots of the most sinister, fire-breathing tequila every now and then ‚Äî just to keep my good old sanity intact. Speaking of vices, I‚Äôve been trying to quit the occasional cigarette for a couple of years now. The climb down the sweet, smoky stairway of nicotine? Undeniably present and gratifying. It‚Äôs the way back up that really gets to you. Literally ‚Äî because climbing any flight of stairs for a smoker is obviously no cakewalk. And I‚Äôve got a whole mountain to climb here, as harrowing as that thought may be. 

The agenda? Making damn sure this girl can‚Äôt invade my thoughts at the oddest hours of the day or night. And I intend to do it in the most ruthless, foolproof way possible. Probably fifteen rounds inside a boxing ring with the devil himself. Like Rocky, toe-to-toe with Drago, eating a storm of right hooks and coma-inducing uppercuts, only to push past his limits and emerge a victor. Because it‚Äôs either that or let my own mind knock me out cold. Believe me, I wouldn‚Äôt be resorting to such pulverizing measures unless I had no other way to move on. But it‚Äôs either this or live out an absurdly random fantasy I‚Äôve had for the longest time ‚Äî stepping through some portal, traveling back to the late ‚Äô60s to catch a Stones concert or witness Hendrix setting the crowd on fire with his incendiary guitar riffs. To really accentuate the whole experience, I‚Äôd probably let some random hippie sell me a blot of acid ‚Äî drop it almost immediately ‚Äî and end up swinging on a rope that carries me through soul-shifting dimensions, with the music guiding the way Maybe that could have been the perfect distraction. A great, big, whimsical cosmic detour ‚Äî just enough to keep me from walking this plank of vulnerability and doom. But no. No detours. No wild psychedelic joyrides ‚Äî not in this life, at least. All I can do is try to slip the devil‚Äôs jabs, counter with a Dempsey roll, and crack open the skull of doubt before it cracks mine. This all feels like an endless stand-up routine ‚Äî solid build-up, but I‚Äôve been waiting on the punchline since the dawn of time. Maybe it‚Äôs time to stop waiting, step onto the stage, and deliver the punchline myself ‚Äî hurling every last reckless, feverish ounce of energy at the audience. 

So here I am.. engulfed in the daunting, sweat-smeared atmosphere of an MMA dojo. I‚Äôd thought about boxing instead ‚Äî been a long-time fan ‚Äî but MMA? It‚Äôs just a more modern, bloodier, and punishing affair altogether when it comes to fighting art forms. Something about the way a fight unravels ‚Äî the raw physics of impact, the split-second decisions between survival and collapse ‚Äî drew me in. Why the hell not? Naturally, my slightly neurotic self was hooked. Maybe this is what I need ‚Äî to keep from teetering on the edge of self-destruction. I even downloaded those gritty ‚Äî slightly over-the-top ‚Äî ‚Äô80s martial arts films starring Van Damme. Watching Bloodsport felt like studying some kind of sacred text. The way he trained for the Kumite ‚Äî ruthless, pulse-racing, remorseless ‚Äî pure adrenaline ‚Äî had me convinced, if only for a second, that I could do the same. Though, let‚Äôs be real, I‚Äôd probably snap in half if I even attempted one of his infamous splits. But hey, it was the ‚Äò80s. Perfection like that was probably fuelled by a lot of cocaine and bad decisions. 

So this is it. One final goodbye. To the girl behind the counter. To the rich umami swirling in every bowl of ramen she made. To the rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll, chain-smoking, free-spirited storm I got so abruptly drawn into. Stepping into oblivion to start anew. The white fur coat will be a distant memory someday ‚Äî and so will that gut-punch of a fist bump. I make my way up the ramp, past the hangar, and into my starship ‚Äî leaving delusion behind, heading straight for realization, with a side serving of bloody noses and broken jaws. I tighten my gloves. Roll my shoulders. Exhale.",1,1743153623.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1jlr0bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1jlr0bz/exhausted/,Exhausted!,"Last month mum had a seizure out of nowhere. She never ever showed any signs of them ever. I immediately called the ambulance because I was not aware of what it was because I have never seen it happening.


At the hospital, we found out that her potassium levels were high. Her speech got slurry as well. More investigations took place and more medications were given. In the midst of that, she also had cough which she was recovering from. But, it got difficult because she didn‚Äôt spit out the mucus. Eventually, they put her in an ICU for 20 days because she kept having seizures. They did X-ray upon X-ray and CT scans all were good. 


Anyways, she got back home a few days ago. She has an NG tube because her muscles have weakened in the throat. We were told to train her muscles again by giving water little by little.


When she got back from the hospital, she seemed to be doing well. I took it as a small bubble of happiness and got married in the courthouse. Nothing fancy, just the two of us who signed the papers and were just so happy with how it went. I have found such an understanding, support system that I never knew this kind of love, support, understanding even existed. He left no stones turned whenever he visited my place to help me with my mum. He didn‚Äôt have to but he did. 


My brother, SIL, dad have been utterly ungrateful and helpless throughout the hospitalisation. Brother and SIL would come whenever they would want to and dad would completely rely upon me to talk with the nurses, the doctors, keep a track of her vitals, stay the nights alone at the hospital while there were days when the three of them would stay together with mum at the hospital during the daytime. But, the thing is they had each other. Whereas I had no one. Even to go get a cup of tea/ coffee I would have to plan and move out of the room strategically. 


Now that she‚Äôs home, she has already pulled her NG tube once which led us to take her back to the hospital. She also had a fever during that time. But, since she pulled the tube I couldn‚Äôt give her her medications. 


Again, she stayed there for a few days and since yesterday she‚Äôs back home. I stayed the nights and sometimes not just the nights. I have stayed for 24 hours, 48 hours and not once was I looked after or even told to relax or take a breather. My husband was the only one who looked after me and helped me. 


Dad can‚Äôt decide what he wants to do and can‚Äôt manage mom so he puts all her decisions on me. Puts her caregiving on me. I can‚Äôt expect anything from my brother or SIL anyways. I am so exhausted. I tried sleeping since I was awake with her the entire night till morning 7.40 am. I told dad to take care of her as it‚Äôs his turn, he has already woken me up twice cause he couldn‚Äôt decide about something and another time because mum wouldn‚Äôt listen to him. 


I haven‚Äôt even completely begin my married life yet. We were in a long distance relationship and now I‚Äôm waiting for the papers and documents to get processed. I feel terrible for saying this but this is way too much for me to deal with and I feel like I‚Äôm the only one doing the most. Even then, I get blamed or belittled or insulted by brother and dad. I feel like I need therapy at this point. ",0,1743153585.0,dementia,0,0.5,False

Presentation:The packaging is superb and also 3ML testers are available which I got for 700 including superb.The vials also contains the stickers on which notes and name of fragrance is mentioned.I also got 11 tester strips in the box which I think is superb idea as generally I dont have them at home.

Almost no alcohol blast in any of the frag.

Carefree Spirit: This starts with lemon and calamasi mixture and goes into cinnamon and nutty way.The base has amber rosewood and patchouli.

Christmas vibes:Their take on killian angel share.I havent smelled the og but individually this can be a nice winter frag.
The projection and longetivity is superb on this.This starts with a mix of rum ,apple and cinnamon.Gradually it shifts to vanilla tonka bean and cashmeran and almonds.

Roses for Mona:This one is loud and for those who loves the rose profile.This has got that fresh roses with water as we gets at home.The combo of musk rose and little green elements make it beautiful rose based fragrance.

Endless Ocean:This is fresh oceanic and starts with mandarin and bergamot.The introduction of lavender and rosemary with amber,musk and patchouli makes it a great summer combo.

Do I care:The starting here is of orange blossom and pink pepper.The heart has got coffee and jasmine.This is something uniques and feels like a mix of two different frags.The base has vanilla cedar patchouli and woody elements.
This is also for evenings and a great frag for parties.

Tobacco Epiphany:This is for those hawan and pooja gatherings.The notes I feel here are honey plum some rose which then goes to saffron some spices vanilla and tobacco is at behind all throughtout.This  is classic and the tobacco is not loud.A beautiful blend.

Fire at Midnight:This starts with orange cinammon and lime mixture.The transition happens towards tobacco and leather and inbetween it introduces cedar ,incense and cumin notes.This has also got a superb longetivity.

Valeour citron: This reminds me of axe dark temptation.The opening of lemon and pink pepper with lavender.The basil and incensy notes are also here.The transition then goes into a different direction where vanilla creame and dark chocolate makes it a cake like frag with lemony vibes.A good allrounder for any occassion.
 
With love Elina:On the lines of PDM delina.The initial notes of rhuherb litchi bergamot and nutmeg makes it super loud.The incense rose and lilly with vanilla some vetivar cedarwood and musk makes this a beautiful blend.
A great option for women and very loud projection frag.

Wu Izshi:This is one of my fav.The raspberry jam,litchi rose and Some musky powdery elements.Little hint if Iris i guess.But this is a beautiful blend and although its for women anyone can give this a try.

Musc Music:The is smooth blend of roses some peach musk amber and powdery tones.This one is also for women and super loud and long lasting.


Performance:Most of them are  loud and projects good  for approx 2 hours.
Longetivity is very good in almost all of them and good 8 hours I got.


Overall I woud say they have done a great work and one should give them a try.This house deserve some appreciation for bringing some unique frags.

I'm unsure if this is common knowledge - but it totally goes beyond just an ideal profile for you beans having the ability to tailor a profile to your taste preferences as well. 

*Backstory: I like a big cup of batch coffee in the mornings - sort of a fill-a-travel-my-bag and go type of brew; however, I don't want acidity first thing in the morning to be part of my first cup. On a whim last evening when I was getting a schedule created, I asked the Profile Creator to build me a profile for a full-bodied, low-acidity batch of Cafe William's Vision - and lo and behold, it did. I went back and looked at the normal profile it had created for these beans, and this new one was surprisingly different - not only that, I'm sipping it now, and it's probably the best-suited brew I have had from that Adien for my personal taste preferences (yes - I'm batch brewing medium-dark espresso beans - shoot me).*

Just imagine being able to build, save, tweak, and troubleshoot profiles in one spot! Call it ""Ask Aiden"" and give him some personality (*I want credit for that one - Fellow, I'm looking at you. Free v2?*). 

Heck - it's a feature I'm sure could be monetized as a premium sub for some users, mind you I'll keep using the existing GPT and my personal side version that likes to swear like a pirate.

## Why Choose a Leather Laptop Bag?

Before diving into specific recommendations, let's address the fundamental question: why choose leather in the first place?‚Å§ While ‚Äçsynthetic alternatives exist, genuine ‚Äçleather offers a unique combination of benefits:

*   **Durability:** A well-crafted‚Äå leather‚Äã laptop bag is an ‚Äãinvestment ‚Å¢that can last for years, even decades, with proper ‚Äçcare. Full grain leather, in particular, is known for its exceptional ‚Äåstrength ‚Å£and resistance to wear and tear.
*   **Style:** Leather exudes a timeless elegance that complements any‚Äã outfit, whether you're heading to a board‚Å¢ meeting or a coffee shop.Whether it's ‚Äça classic brown leather laptop bag or a elegant ‚Äãblack ‚Å£leather laptop bag, ‚Äåthere's a leather bag to match your personal aesthetic.
*   **Professionalism:**‚Äç A leather bag conveys an image of competence‚Äã and attention to detail, making it an‚Å¢ ideal accessory for professionals in various fields.
*   **Protection:** Leather provides excellent protection for your laptop, shielding it ‚Å§from bumps, scratches, and minor impacts.
* ‚Å§  **unique Character:** Over‚Äå time, leather develops a unique patina, adding character and‚Å¢ individuality ‚Äãto your bag.[[Explore Top Rated leather laptop bag on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/electronics-products/?kw=leather laptop bag)
## Understanding Leather Grades: What You‚Äç Need to Know

Not all leather is created equal. The quality and durability of a leather laptop bag ‚Å¢depend largely‚Äå on the type ‚Å£of‚Å¢ leather used. Here's a quick rundown of the most common leather grades:

*   **Full Grain Leather:** This is‚Äç the highest quality leather, made from the entire hide with ‚Å¢minimal processing.Full ‚Äågrain leather laptop bags are incredibly durable and develop a beautiful patina over‚Å§ time.
*   **Top Grain Leather:** This is ‚Å§the second-highest quality leather, made from the‚Äå top layer ‚Äçof the hide after imperfections‚Å§ have been removed. It's more affordable than full grain but still offers excellent‚Å£ durability and ‚Äça refined‚Å¢ appearance. ‚Å§Some premium ‚Å£leather laptop bag ‚Å£options utilize ‚Äãtop grain‚Äã leather.
* ‚Å£  **Genuine ‚ÄåLeather:**‚Äå This ‚Äçterm can be‚Äç misleading. It refers to leather made from‚Å£ leftover scraps of hide‚Äã that have been bonded together. While more affordable, genuine ‚Å§leather is less durable‚Å¢ and less aesthetically pleasing than full or‚Å¢ top grain leather.
* ‚Å¢  **Bonded Leather:** This is the lowest quality ‚Äåleather,made from leather ‚Äãscraps that have been shredded and glued together.‚Äå It's typically very inexpensive and doesn't offer the same‚Å§ durability or longevity as‚Äå higher-grade leathers.

When choosing a leather laptop bag,‚Äå prioritize full grain or ‚Äåtop grain leather for the best‚Å§ combination of quality, durability, and style.

Ever have those days where your brain feels like it's wading through molasses? üß†üí® You sit down to work and suddenly... poof! Your mind's gone on a holiday, and all that's left is a fuzzy fog. If you're nodding along, you're definitely not alone. We ALL struggle with brain fog at times. But what if I told you there‚Äôs a *10-second trick* that could clear it up? üå§Ô∏è

**Story time!:** Last Tuesday, I was on my third cup of coffee (don't judge üòÇ), trying to focus on this report that was due. But my mind was stuck on a loop of random 90s song lyrics... ever been there?! In a fit of desperation, I remembered something simple I read about somewhere. I thought, ""Why not give it a whirl?"" And guess what? It actually WORKED. üí°

Okay, enough suspense. Here's the trick: **Deep Breathing.** Yep, that‚Äôs it. I know it sounds too simple to be true, but give it a shot.

**Here‚Äôs how it goes:**

1. Sit up straight. Seriously, posture helps. Told you this would be easy.
2. **Inhale deeply** through your nose for 5 seconds. Feel the air filling your lungs.
3. **Exhale slowly** through your mouth for another 5 seconds. Imagine you're breathing out that fog.
4. Repeat a couple of times. Feel like a new person yet?

Why does this work? üßê It gives your brain a mini restart, like turning your computer off and on again. Plus, it sends a fresh burst of oxygen to your brain, waking it up faster than any espresso shot ever could. ‚òï

**Benefits:**
- Quick ‚Äì done in a moment!
- No equipment needed. Bye-bye, fancy gadgets. 
- Calming. Who doesn‚Äôt love a side of calm with their clarity?

So, next time you find yourself mentally drifting into the abyss, remember this 10-second rescue. You‚Äôll be back to kicking butt in no time.

Originally planned 21st - 28th, lost a day due to volcanic ash on 21st, flew with Garuda on 22nd instead. Highly recommend Garuda over Jetstar. 

3 nights at SenS Hotel Ubud: $100/night, great location in central Ubud walkable distance to markets, convenience stores & restaurants. 

Ubud highlights:
- Runs Warung
- Ketuts cooking class
- Tegallalang Rice Fields
- Luwak Coffee Agro Alas Harum 
- Cretya Ubud (best part of the whole trip for me!)
- Monkey Forest
- Teganungan Waterfall
- Pura Tirta Empul Temple
- ATV Ubud Adventure

2 nights at Hyatt Regency Sanur: $250/night, this place is huge. You could spend your entire holiday here if you wanted to, though it would cost you a fair bit as food/drink onsite is way more expensive than local shops close by. We got the impression that the location and layout of the resort encourages you to stay there and spend more money on site. Not a bad thing if that‚Äôs up your alley, but if we stay in Sanur again it‚Äôll probably be closer to the local shops & markets. We originally booked the Hyatt as it was close to our Nusa Penida day trip, which was also cancelled due to weather.

Sanur highlights:
- Warung Pengkola, live music and awesome local food
- Clean picturesque beach, walkable along boardwalk 
- Icon Bali, I‚Äôm not big on shopping but we attempted to walk the boardwalk on the first day in the heat. It was really nice to have a huge air conditioned building to chill out in.
- Eyerizz, $20 for frames with prescription lenses ready in one day.

I have previously had 2 failed transfers of euploid embryos. The fibroids were distorting the shape of my uterus. Thank you so much to this community for helping me prepare!!!

I am now one week post op and able to post about my journey. 

Surgery Day 
I got to the hospital at 6:30 am. Then got changed and was waiting for my turn. They took some bloods and urine to check for pregnancy. The nurse came and put emla on my hands for the cannula. I had asked for this as I was scared it will hurt and emla is a numbing cream. 

I was taken to the operating theatre around 10:30 and immediately put to sleep. I woke up in recovery later and pain was a 4/5 and I was in and out of sleep. I was taken to my room around 2:30 pm. The surgeon took out 22 fibroids (largest being 6cm). The MRI had shown 11 so this was a shocker and the surgery went on for 2.5 hours. I luckily had minimal blood loss during surgery. 

Hospital Stay
I stayed at the hospital for 3 nights. 

Thursday: The first night (night of surgery) I was on some hardcore painkillers including fentanyl and was mainly in and out of sleep. I had a catheter in me so I did not have to get out of bed to pee. I ate two bites of food but mostly slept - did not even have energy to check my phone. 

Friday: The second day they took out the catheter - it did not hurt at all. They also took out the fentanyl. I was in more discomfort today - less pain more soreness but I walked to the toilet multiple times to use the loo. Pain was higher later in the day so they gave me morphine which lead to nausea. I vomitted twice and that really hurt. I was on IV anti nausea 

Saturday: nausea continues so they can‚Äôt discharge me. Pain manageable with ibuprofen, paracetamol and codene. I‚Äôm eating a little more and walking 4-5 times a day while supporting my belly with my hand. They were strongly against any binders. They also started my stoic softeners. 

Home
I was discharged Sunday morning (after 3 nights) and gave been home since. Everyday is an incremental improvement. My pain is managed by paracetamol and ibuprofen. 

I was able to go to the toilet once I got home - hot prune juice and milk of magnesia did the trick for me! 

I am walking everyday at-least 5 times and increases the length of my walks. I haven‚Äôt left home yet but I do go down to my building garden. I have friends visit and take daily showers but outside of that I rest a lot. My stitches were taken out 7 days post surgery. 

Key tips: 
* if you can rest, please rest - I nap/lay in bed a lot to relax
* Work - I technically feel able to work. I can reply to some emails here and there but I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm making a conscious effort to do nothing that doesn‚Äôt improve my health for 20 days. Then I‚Äôll ease into it. 
* Support - I still need a lot of help. I can‚Äôt bend, I can‚Äôt lift, I can‚Äôt walk my dog etc. 
* Wedge pillow and bed rail - these two are critical for me 
* Pain meds - stay on top of them as everyone says! Put an alarm - don‚Äôt miss it. Catching up on pain meds is very painful  
* Outfits: I can‚Äôt wear pyjamas cause I can‚Äôt bend down. So I am living in Kaftans 
* Diet: I am still on a very simple diet. I have only eaten home cooked meals of easy to digest foods and have stopped drinking coffee ( I don‚Äôt have the craving anymore) 
* TTC : I am cleared to ttc after 12 weeks. My tubes were clear during the surgery but my fertility specialists will do more scans to make sure no scar tissue and uterus is ready. I‚Äôll keep you guys posted!‚Äô

1jlqey3,https://i.redd.it/yfmys6186ere1.jpeg,Thoughts on the Coffee Machine Upgrade (Luxe 360 - lvl. 9),"First of all, I absolutely love this game, so I really hope this doesn‚Äôt come across as if I don‚Äôt like anything about it. BUT I have a big wish‚Äîthough I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the only one who feels this way or if I‚Äôm doing something wrong.

The thing is, I upgraded my coffee machine so it can make two shots at a time. However, I don‚Äôt see the functionality I was hoping for. In fact, I find it quite unnecessary and not very helpful, even though I had to spend 30 diamonds and a lot of in-game money to get this upgrade.

When making an order that requires two shots, you first have to grind the first one. But since the upgraded machine is fast, there isn‚Äôt enough time to grind the second one while the first shot is being made. This means either you get a bad espresso or you have to wait anyway. The alternative is to grind both shots first and start them at the same time, but then it‚Äôs difficult to stop them both in time. Otherwise, you can start them slightly apart and just wait.

What I find frustrating is that you can‚Äôt do anything else in the meantime because you have to manually stop the machine. I had really hoped the upgrade would allow me to grind once and then automatically produce two shots from that single grind‚Äîor even adjust based on the number of cups placed (as shown in the picture). Another improvement would be for the machine to stop automatically instead of requiring manual stopping, so players have time to do other tasks.

Additionally, it‚Äôs a bit disappointing that the steamer doesn‚Äôt also get bigger to match the increased number of shots‚Äîjust a steamer that can hold two cups would make a big difference.

I love this game, but this aspect feels a bit frustrating, especially after spending so many diamonds on an upgrade that doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me. Again, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm alone in feeling this way, and if I‚Äôm doing something wrong, I‚Äôd love to hear any tips. Otherwise, great game!",7,1743150778.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,1,1.0,False

<div>Creating the perfect man cave Christmas decor can transform your personal space into a winter wonderland that still captures your unique style. Emphasizing a blend of masculinity and festive cheer will make your man cave an inviting spot for friends and family during the holiday season. Start by selecting a color palette that reflects your personality. Rich greens, deep reds, and metallic golds or silvers often harmonize beautifully, adding a seasonal charm to your space.

For wall decor, consider hanging a rustic deer antler wreath or a bold, oversized Christmas stocking. There are many options to infuse your man cave with holiday spirit while maintaining its masculine edge. Vintage signs and sports memorabilia can be adorned with subtle holiday touches, like twinkle lights wrapped around them, creating a festive atmosphere without losing your space's identity.

- **Lighting:** Invest in stylish yet cozy lighting, such as pendant lamps or string lights that mimic stars. A well-lit room can enhance the cheerful atmosphere and allow for a cozy movie night.
- **Furniture Decor:** Use throw pillows with holiday patterns on your couch, or add a warm, rustic blanket to your armchair. These touches will not only provide comfort but also reflect the season's spirit.
- **Table Centerpiece:** Create a eye-catching centerpiece for your bar or coffee table using elements like pinecones, candles, or miniature Christmas trees in earthy tones.

A festive scent can elevate the ambiance‚Äîconsider using a diffuser with pine or cinnamon essential oils.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations‚Äîthe ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates. Quantum Heights, once a mere city, transformed into a living algorithm, where the repetition of the mantra echoed in every pulsating byte.

The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged‚Äîa message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

Unfortunately it happened to me aswell - parosmia. 

The pity being that it‚Äôs right before my 2 week trip to the other side of the world, where I really wanted to try some food out. 

I had some kind of infection (god knows what, because covid tests didn‚Äôt come positive) and my smell is partly gone. 

Many things don‚Äôt really have a scent, and things such as coffee and peanut butter smell like charred wood. 

I‚Äôve tried rinsing my sinuses, some nasal sterroids are still ongoing, vitamin b1, alpha lipoic acid, strong scent smelling and even some peppermint oil to unclog my sinuses, but nothing helped.

Did anyone get rid of parosmia recently or had any progress or methods?

I recently bought a pair of Caroline loafers (coffee) in size 39. They were small in length ( at the point that I would feel them uncomfortable ) and in fact, comparing to shoes that I already own they were a smaller length. I then bought the next size (40). This time the shoes are good in length but way too wide in width. Honestly I can‚Äôt justify keeping them since they are costly and they don‚Äôt fit. However, I was wondering if some of you had a similar experience of finding the Sezane shoes wider and a bit shorter than usual, and how did you adapter to this? Or did you just give up on Sezane shoes? I was disappointed since I really love the shoes and I wanted to keep them :(

Give me a reason if I am.","I‚Äôll give you a brief backstory first. I(23F) went on a date with this guy(24M) last week and it went really well. We went for a walk, got a coffee, bonded over many things, he drove around and showed me the whole city because I‚Äôm new here and kept saying things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll meet my friends‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you there sometime‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll go for a walk there soon‚Äù. Half way through the date he was asking me what my plans were so we could set another date. He was nervous and laughed a lot, I could tell he liked me. The date lasted 6 hours.

Anyway

I spent the whole day thinking about him the next day and started developing a little crush. It was my first date after a long term relationship so it was exciting.
The next night he texted me asking if I wanted to go for a late night drive with him. It was 9pm and I was already in bed, but I got up, threw on my makeup and a cute outfit and ran out the door. I told him I was already outside with my friends and that I‚Äôd meet him in 15 minutes haha. 

This time around I was really nervous though. Because I liked him. So I was really quiet and it was kind of awkward. I kind of waited for him to initiate conversation but it wasn‚Äôt anything interesting. He made a few jokes here and there and I laughed. He remembered from our last date that I applied for a job in this big company and he drove all the way there to show me. At one point he pulled up outside the beach, we both got out but nothing happened. I just started talking about how pretty the stars looked and random things. Then we got back in the car. I thought he was going to kiss me. We started driving back, and he pulled up again near this scenic walkway. It was about midnight at this point. I thought for sure he was going to kiss me then. But he brought a bag of peanuts and was munching on them the whole walk. He noticed I was getting cold so we got back in the car after about 10mins.

We drove back to near where I live, then the conversation picked up again so he started driving around the area in circles. I think he wanted to extend the date but I‚Äôm not sure.

Anyway, he parked outside my house and I was really awkward and just said ‚Äúsee you soon! Bye‚Äù. And got out. That was it.

Now, this is where I need advice. I texted him as soon as I got home saying ‚Äúsafe travels home x‚Äù. I felt really embarrassed about how awkward and quiet I was. He didn‚Äôt respond and I spent the whole night beating myself up about it. The next morning he responded ‚ÄúI went straight to sleep, didn‚Äôt even get to eat my dinner haha‚Äù ‚Äúdid you sleep well‚Äù. I texted an hour later saying ‚Äúglad to hear you didn‚Äôt mess up your sleep schedule. Thanks for the spin last night, would love to see X place during the day sometime :)‚Äù. Because we couldn‚Äôt really see the beach because it was night time and he told me on that date, ‚Äúit‚Äôs way nicer during the day, I‚Äôll bring you sometime‚Äù. Anyway, he didn‚Äôt respond to that text :/. It‚Äôs been three days. No response. And I‚Äôm not that sad about it but I really saw potential in him. And I got butterflies around him.

I‚Äôm thinking of sending him a text along the lines of ‚Äúpromise I‚Äôm not actually that dry. You‚Äôre the first date I went on after being in a long term relationship so I‚Äôm still really new to all of this. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm supposed to say or not say and I just end up going quiet. I know we‚Äôve only been on two dates but I like your vibe and I want to see where it goes. Maybe we could grab a drink some time‚Äù

Is that absolutely crazy to send. Or is the honesty refreshing lol

1jlq929,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1jlq929/how_i_transformed_from_a_chronic_procrastinator/,How I Transformed from a Chronic Procrastinator to Taking Consistent Action,"For years, I was the poster child of procrastination. My life was a constant cycle of missed deadlines, last-minute panic, and crushing self-doubt. I'd spend more energy avoiding tasks than actually doing them. Sound familiar?

My Rock Bottom Moment
It was 2 AM, surrounded by coffee cups, facing a project deadline that felt like an impossible mountain. My dreams, my goals, my potential‚Äîall seemed to be slipping away because I couldn't overcome this invisible barrier holding me back.

The Turning Point
I realized procrastination wasn't about laziness. It was an emotional regulation problem deeply rooted in fear, perfectionism, and a misunderstood relationship with my own capabilities.

3 Strategies That Changed Everything:

1. Emotional Trigger Mapping
I started tracking my emotions when facing tasks. Was I avoiding work because of fear of failure? Perfectionism? Overwhelming complexity? Understanding the ""why"" behind my procrastination was the first breakthrough.

2. The 30-Second Rule
I committed to just 30 seconds of a task. Sounds simple, right? But here's the magic‚Äîmost times, those 30 seconds turned into hours of focused work. Our brain loves momentum.

3. Dopamine-Driven Habit Stacking
I attached new productive behaviors to existing habits. Want to start reading? Do it right after your morning coffee. Want to exercise? Place your workout clothes next to your bed.

The Transformation
Slowly, deliberately, I rewired my brain. Not through force, but through understanding, compassion, and small, consistent actions.

My Journey Resulted in a Comprehensive Guide
After years of research, neuroscience insights, and personal transformation, I compiled everything into a 7-day mindset reset guide. It's not just another productivity book‚Äîit's a scientifically-backed roadmap to breaking free from procrastination.

The dosage was soon changed to split: 40 mg in the morning and 30 mg 6‚Äì8 hours later. I was a high school dropout before Vyvanse helped me increase my productivity and make over six figures. Standing desks, nicotine patches, coffee, creatine, cold baths twice a day, daily morning outdoor jogs, and frequent NSDR sessions helped me further optimise. In the middle, I have taken moda from highstreetpharma for a change and it was effective but it was giving anxiety after prolonged use.

Diet and Routine:

Diet: Pescatarian-keto; one high-protein breakfast (fish, eggs, or pea protein alternate), a snack of almonds or avocado on occasion, and vegetables with MCT oil in the evening. It is rare to consume more than 50g of protein each day.

Activity: watching Netflix or sports and jogging on a treadmill for around two hours every day

5‚Äì6 hours of sleep per night.

Daily Productivity:

~12 hrs intense cognitive work, 3 hrs leisure, 2-3 hrs routine tasks, 1 hr journaling or reading.

Concern:

Over the past 3 months, developed significant Vyvanse tolerance while pursuing new job opportunity. Regularly exceeding prescribed dose by up to 150% (sometimes 140mg at once). Recently took >100mg daily for five consecutive days, causing severe sleep disruption. Alarmingly, higher doses now feel ""normal,"" with minimal heart rate elevation and diminished euphoria. Planning full abstinence this weekend, but must continue Vyvanse for another month to finish critical projects.

Question:

From your experience, does extended abstinence effectively restore baseline sensitivity after prolonged Vyvanse overuse? Any personal insights or advice appreciated.",4,1743149951.0,Biohackers,4,1.0,False
1jlq75z,https://www.reddit.com/r/zanzibar/comments/1jlq75z/sharing_our_zanzibar_travel_experience/,Sharing our Zanzibar travel experience,"I wanted to share some comments around our trip to Zanzibar to maybe answer some questions people have when looking for information. 

We did a working holiday, 2.5 weeks of remote work, and .5 week off to explore (+ days off over weekend). 

Remote working:
We based ourselves in Paje as we heard it had the best remote working. It exceeded our expectations. Most places had decent WIFI and the places that market themselves for remote workers had excellent WIFI. Over 2.5 weeks of work we had no issues with internet connections. We could take calls with camera on also. 
Mr Kahawa - co working space is good here, but can get noisy as the coffee machine is in the main room. 
Shanga - the best place to work remotely when you need quiet. Sit upstairs in a lovely surrounding looking out over the beach. 
Most cafes though you can set up your laptop and work from, but as we needed to work 9-5 each day we found Shanga worked best for us. 

March weather
Yes it did rain, but it was that tropical down pour of rain that came down hard and fast and then was over within the hour. We had some sunny days, some cloudy days, but overall the weather for us in March (which i know differs from year to year) was fine. 

Ramadan
We didn't think that Ramadan negatively impacted our trip. 95% of the restaurants remain open and they continue to serve alcohol. There were some places that closed from 6.30-7.30pm for one hour to break the fast, but this was rare and most places remained fully open. 
We are not party people, so we weren't looking to go to rowdy bars or nightclubs or anything so can't comment on that. From what I'd read on Reddit people said don't go over Ramadan everything's closed, and this is just completely untrue. 

Nungwi vs Paje
We stayed in both places and really did enjoy Paje much better. Nungwi has the better beaches, but that's about it in our opinion. The restaurants/food in Paje is so much better than Nungwi and just the overall vibe of Paje is much more laid back, and you get hassled far less by someone trying to sell you something. 
We just spent four days in Nungwi to go diving, and that was enough for us, we headed straight back to Paje afterwards. 
I'm sure there are other lovely places on the island, but these are the places we visited. 

Visa / Money / Airport
We did the visa before arriving into Zanzibar airport. We applied online and got the approval 4 days later. 
When we arrived at the airport we had to show our mandatory travel insurance and then also our approved visa. From getting off the plane to picking up our bags it took 20 mins. I'd highly recommend printing your insurance and visa, it was easier that way and we passed a lot of people struggling to find their stuff on their phones. 
We'd recommend pre organising a taxi before hand, as it can be a little hectic when you leave the airport. Don't let the taxi driver take your bag either, cos he'll hand it off to a porter, and then they'll expect money from you. 
There are ATMs at the airport. Get your cash there cos there are limited ATMs readily available around the island. Each room we stayed in had a safe, so we felt our cash and valuable items were secure at all times. 

Supermarkets
There aren't really any big supermarkets with a variety of items in Paje or Nungwi. They have tiny little mini marts with verrrrryyy limited items. This is to do with import taxes being very high. Especially if you're coming with children, it's essential you bring what you need with you, as there will only be one of each item if that at these mini marts, and you'll pay quite a bit. 

Costs (what we paid)
Overall we found Zanzibar more expensive then we'd anticipated. Don't expect cos it's Africa it'll be cheap, this was not our experience. 
We organised our first taxi through booking.com but then we got the number of the driver on whatsapp and just messaged him whenever we wanted a taxi. 
Taxi from Paje to Nungwi - USD 45
Taxi from Paje to airport hotel - USD 30
A large beer - USD $2-5 on average
A meal - USD $8-15 on average
We always had breakfast at hotel, a light lunch, some drinks, coffees and dinner each day and we spent on average about USD $70 in total per day for two people. 

Activities
We didn't really do any organised tours other than scuba diving. 
We went with Spanish Dancer Divers in Nungwi. We paid about USD $500 for two days of diving for two people. We had an awesome experience with them and would highly recommend.
