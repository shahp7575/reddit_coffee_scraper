I worked with an agency to secure my housing, whose service has so far been great.  The provided website had two photos of Busan goshiwon units, both of which had windows.  The process was such that I paid for it in full, up-front, and *then* received more information on the property--and to my unpleasant surprise, my unit has no window.  :(  I'll admit, I believe the timeline was pretty tight for the class start date, so that may have contributed to a lack of options.  I may explore finding somewhere else to live once my student visa is approved, whether through the agency again or via another channel.  I'm still committed to goshiwons over dorms or shared housing, because I have a strong preference for a private bathroom.

  
So, for the sake of my mental health, I anticipate voluntarily spending a lot of time on campus and at coffee shops.  **Does anyone have any other advice for spending time in public spaces that doesn't require a lot of money?**  I'm open to both general suggestions and specific locations/activities.

  
I'm excited to learn more about your beautiful city and hope to be able to hold some conversations in Korean soon.  I'm looking for friends, so if anyone is interested in chatting with me, please DM!",1,1763885725.0,busan,0,1.0,False

what i’ve tried so far:
the gym: im pretty active and go to the gym between 4-6 times per week and try to look friendly and open to a conversation but maybe the time i go at isn’t great for meeting people? i tend to go late at night or at lunch time so that could be a problem

mutual friends: most of the men are in a relationship, engaged or married so although we get along platonically obviously nothing will be happening there 

beer leagues: good platonic friendships but nothing much has come out of it 

being a regular at a cafe: great friendship built up with baristas but most people seem to be there to do work or get in an out with coffee 

run clubs: i might have gone to the wrong ones but most people seemed to already know each other and run within their groups + made a few great friendships with women but not much potential so far 

does anyone have any advice? any help is welcome :(

1p4hcn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1p4hcn6/the_book_that_woke_me_up_it_wasnt_crisis_of/,The Book That Woke Me Up (It Wasn’t Crisis of Conscience),"I was a born in JW, PIMI for many years, PIMO for less than a year. While I was a PIMI, I read a book that pushed me in the right direction. 

The book is called “Watchmen” by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It’s technically a graphic novel, but it’s a very approachable story regardless of whether you like comics or superheroes (I certainly don’t, but the story has a lot to offer regardless of your preferences). 

Essentially, the characters are split into two camps based on their approach to a central question: which is better, remaining blissfully ignorant or acknowledging the truth to one’s own detriment? 

Unlike Crisis of Conscience or Combatting Cult Mind Control, you could have this book on your coffee table, and visiting PIMI’s probably wouldn’t think twice about it. But the central theme resonated with me since I always had my doubts. 

(Strangely, there’s a background character who is a JW preaching about the end of the world. SPOILER, the book does not end with the GB going to heaven while the great crowd rebuilds civilization.) 

However, the book made me realize something I had unconsciously noticed for a long time: most people would rather live in ignorance instead of learning the facts. 

Growing up in the “truth”, I thought I already knew all the answers, but in reality, I was just ignorant. Ironically, I routinely did “research” into Bible topics as directed by the org, but of course, these research sessions were limited to the org’s own research materials, never outside sources. When I discovered some discomforting contradictions between the Bible’s teachings and the org’s doctrines, I had to answer the same question from “Watchmen” - should I stay ignorant (by staying in the org) or look for the real truth (and risk losing my friends, family, and everyone else I had ever known). Of course, it helped that I was never really happy as a JW; I never liked the idea of being purposefully ignorant. 

Since I woke up, I’ve seen this trope (blissful ignorance v. truth at a cost) in many different stories (1984, the Matrix, Severance, etc.), so I guess it is not exclusive to us. But in the end, I prefer knowing the truth, even if it causes pain, because I can learn from the pain and start moving forward. ",3,1763885585.0,exjw,0,1.0,False

What were these objects that lay through The Ghost? He was transparent as the glass bottle of Jack Daniel's through his belly, yet he could not be touched. Matter of fact, same principle applied to when he reached for the bottle of whiskey. But why drink now? Mind's cloudy... nothing. His vision began to unblur, revealing a bedroom but with no walls to separate the bed from the living room. In front of the Ghost, onto his left side, there was a television. Screen was pitch black. There were more cans, more pails containing varying liquors; judging from the different labels. Some lay spilled, opened at the top. Some lay empty. No smell to ascertain the quantity. They were there, for whatever the reason.

Shoes. The pair were white-tipped sneakers. They looked untouched, removed from any stains. The Ghost investigated, the closet door wide open. No remaining clothes. Was anybody here before him? And if so, where were they? The Ghost stood, as though he recognised the polished wooden floors could hold his gravity. Nothing else could be distinguishable for as long as the Ghost stood in his position; all he could do was to continue walking.

A door spawned to existence; inside it, a whirling portal. The Ghost stopped. Meanwhile, the walls pixelated, returning to what appeared to be static, accompanied by the vague sounds of gurgling. Indecipherable noise. The Ghost remained still, now watching the pails, cans and that Jack Daniel's bottle swiveling around him as though they were in orbit.

A voice echoed, “Such an untimely fate you've been met with.”

Then, new objects materialised into orbit; items such as closed cardboard boxes full of clothing and picture frames of a young man, surrounded by other people in the night sky all throughout daytime. The Ghost couldn't identify who the young man in that frame was. But whoever he was, he appeared content no matter how severe the storms.

“Who was he?”, responded the Ghost.

Nothing...

As the Ghost attempted to move away from the items swirling around his waist, they followed him, resembling a large halo. Sudden desolation dawned upon the Ghost; nobody could hear his pleas for rescue, save for the Monsters that would irrevocably tarnish his soul and be condemned into the pits of Hell with them if they heard. Burdened by the alcoholic beverages and photographs circulating around the Ghost like a prompter, he crouched down, as though perched on a seat. A bench materialised from its legs, along with an unraveling pathway with pricks of green grass that trailed and winded down to a distant coffee shop, sounds of gentle waves crashing into one another like sequence. The Ghost's hands clasped, like a request for the Holy Bread and Wine; except, he was given a coffee mug, also pixelating itself into existence. The Ghost looked at the words scrawled with a black marker pen...

“William Death,” hushed that voice, “his name belonged to you.”

The Ghost watched a crowd of people, congregating by a patch of grass, separating the dirt from the sand. He observed a youthful, fair-skinned girl with dirty blonde hair, braided. That same figure was holding a soccer ball and was wearing her blue and yellow sports gear. She had been idling there, her back facing the Ghost, for as long as he could recall. That same girl collapsed to her knees, her palms burrowed against her eyes, appearing distraught as what looked like her friends were consoling her. The Ghost solemnly pointed his head back down to his lap, only to find his coffee cup disappeared from his hands, replaced with a rose.

“Give the rose to her, to your sister...” spoke that voice again. “You're gone, but she wishes to see you again.”",1,1763885208.0,writers,1,1.0,False

1p4h84d,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1p4h84d/transform_your_life_easy_optimization_hacks_for/,🔥 Transform Your Life! Easy Optimization Hacks for Max Happiness & Productivity 🚀✨,"Hey Maximizame fam,

Ever feel like ""transforming your life"" is this massive, impossible task? Like you have to climb Everest in your pajamas? I get it. But what if transformation isn't about one giant leap, but a thousand tiny, easy steps?

That's where optimization hacks come in. Not the complicated, life-overhaul kind, but the simple, almost-too-easy-to-work kind.

Let's break it down into the two big buckets: **Productivity & Happiness.**

**For a Quick Productivity Boost 🚀:**

*   **The 2-Minute Rule:** If a task pops up that takes less than two minutes (replying to an email, putting a dish away), just do it. Immediately. It's wild how much mental clutter this clears.
*   **Win the Morning:** Don't try to do everything. Just identify ONE single thing that, if you get it done, will make today a win. Do that first. Everything else is a bonus.
*   **""Brain Dump"" Your Way to Clarity:** Before you start your day or end your night, grab a piece of paper and write down every single thing on your mind. All the to-dos, worries, and random ideas. Get it out of your head and onto paper so you can actually focus.

**For a Shot of Happiness ✨:**

*   **Create a ""Joy List"":** Seriously, make a list in your phone's notes of small things that genuinely make you smile. A specific song, a hot cup of coffee, watching a funny animal video. When you're feeling blah, pick one and do it. No questions asked.
*   **5-Minute ""Do Nothing"" Break:** Set a timer for 5 minutes and just... be. Sit, stare out the window, listen to the sounds around you. No phone, no tasks. It’s like a reset button for your nervous system.
*   **Gratitude Goggles:** Before you go to sleep, think of just ONE good thing that happened today. Could be tiny. A stranger held the door open, the sun was out, you nailed a parking spot. It trains your brain to look for the good.

Of course, some days these little hacks just don't cut it. Sometimes the 'happiness' part feels like the hardest mountain to climb, especially when you're dealing with a lot of emotional weight. It's totally okay to need a more structured approach to figure that stuff out.

For anyone feeling stuck in that department, I've found that getting a clear plan for your emotional well-being can be a true game-changer. If that sounds like you, you might find **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** helpful for creating a roadmap.

Anyway, these are just a few things that have helped me. Now I'm curious...

I bought this book because my wife wouldn't stop talking about the ""Let Them"" theory, and I saw a few guys in my network nodding along to the clips on LinkedIn. I figured maybe there’s a solid management principle here about delegation or emotional detachment.

This is the entire book in one sentence: 

**You can’t control other people, so stop trying and focus on yourself.**

There. I just saved you $28 and six hours of your life.

The core concept is fine. Actually, it’s great. It’s basic Stoicism. It’s Epictetus for the Instagram generation. If you’ve never read a philosophy book in your life, this might blow your mind. But for anyone who has lived in the real world, managed a payroll, or raised teenagers, this is common sense repackaged with a trademark symbol.

My issue isn't the message; it's the packaging. This book is the definition of ""this meeting could have been an email."" Robbins takes a concept that fits perfectly on a coffee mug and stretches it into an agonizingly repetitive marathon. She hammers the same point home over and over again until you feel like you’re being lectured by a chaotic friend who had too much espresso.

The writing style is exhausting. It reads exactly like a podcast transcript with lots of breathless bold text, one-sentence paragraphs, and ""Wait, let me tell you a story about my dog/kid/husband."" I don't care about the anecdotes unless they drive the point forward. Half the time, they just felt like filler to hit a page count.

And then there's the ""Let Me"" section. It feels like she realized halfway through that ""Let Them"" sounds a lot like ""be a doormat,"" so she scrambled to tack on a section about boundaries. It’s clunky. It tries to be a catch-all solution for everything from annoying in-laws to serious trauma, and frankly, it lacks the depth for the heavy stuff.

If you’re a business owner, you’ll be checking your watch by chapter three. It’s fluff. It’s conversational cotton candy, tastes sweet for a second, but dissolves into nothing.

Do yourself a favor and Google the poem this concept was based on, print it out, stick it on your fridge, and get back to work. You likely don’t need the book.",1,1763884653.0,TheBookTribunal,0,1.0,False

1p4h2iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1p4h2iz/do_you_think_its_possible_for_me_to_change_for_my/,Do you think it's possible for me to change for my BF? (21F and 24M),"I (21F) am with my bf (24M). We met on Discord this May. He flee to my city just for me, stayed in a hotel for a week. We had a lot of fun, no arguments. On this September he got an apartment in my city while I'm studying and staying in my dorm. I often visit him, but seems like I'm a little too messy too often. and I don't have energy to clean every day, and he's also kinda messy so his apartment is a constant mess. We argue a lot, but I believe it's a part of growth. So what do you think I should do? Can I change after a decade of being a mess and being scolded about this significant issue I've been struggling with? Tips?

So we have this problem, or well, I have this problem... I pull out my hair very often to the point I just cannot stop and I'm balding and for some reason, I find comfort in seeing my hair all over the floors or the couch. Obviously, my bf doesn't like seeing hair everywhere, so I'm trying to put it into the trash and vacuum the floors, but I still pull out my hair without noticing, and sometimes I see no point in cleaning right away, like why can't I clean it just a bit later, why do I have to do this right away? I'll say that my bf isn't perfect and the most clean and organized man ever I'd say I'm somewhat more organized and cleaner sometimes. It's weird like I can barely force myself to vacuum or mop the floors sometimes or just do nothing but then one day out of the blue, I have this energy to clean and organize everything. Sometimes my bf likes that and appreciates it but sometimes he doesn't like the way I organize stuff into the cupboards and he wants to see everything on the table, but I do not like that. Anyway I did accept that I said whatever but I feel like he wants me to help him more with cooking and cleaning and shopping. I do try doing this but sometimes I feel so dead tired or perhaps I'm just lazy and that's how I was raised. I used to be obsessed with cleaning as a child, but then in my teenage years, I became a hoarder and I clean only when I have this random burst of energy in me to the point I look obsessed and it annoys people because I want everything to be spotless. Like there's no middle ground, I'm either full of dirt and mess or one of those OCD ladies. Sometimes my bf is forcibly trying to stop me when I'm cleaning, saying it's enough and let's just chill together, but I want to keep going or I'm having a crisis.

He says if I love him, I should be able to change for him and clean regularly, not just once a week or once in a while when I have random energy bursts. IDK what's wrong with me I have been scolded and beaten up throughout my teenage and young adulthood years about how messy I am but for some reason it didn't change anything and I'm still the person I am today, so is it possible for me to change and become a better cleaner person that my bf wants me to be for him? More rational as well... because I like to buy coffee outside but he thinks it's ridiculously expensive and why would you buy coffee outside when we have coffee at home and you could buy delicious food instead... I also used to fantasize about weddings and stuff but seems like he's beyond that and not into wedding dresses or costumes, smokings and so on. He said that he thought we already established that but what we actually agree on is that we don't want a big wedding or any people. But I did want to wear a wedding dress or have a pretty ring... so I thought about it and accepted it, although it did make me upset a little. He thinks it's just a waste of money, which I understand and perhaps it is.

I often shut down when we have arguments and he feels anxious when I don't reply. BTW we have arguments very often and every time I shut down, cry, try to hurt myself and then we apologize to each other. I promise this won't happen again but then something else happens... I wonder if this will ever end or it'll be just a normal part of our lives. I want to believe that this is just a process of understanding each other and growing, learning your mistakes, what's wrong and what's right and life is full of lessons just like relationships are like life-long lessons.

So what would be your thoughts on this? Can I change for a loved one at 21? What should I do? Should I just try harder? Any tips?

    **TL;DR; : I'm too low on energy too often and I wish I could be a better fit for my bf do you think I can change
    ,
     and how?

I’m looking to get my dad an espresso machine for Christmas. He really likes coffee but has never owned an espresso machine before, so I want to get him something solid and also bundle everything he needs to start using it right away.

My budget is around 300 dollars, maybe 50 dollars more if needed. I’ve seen the Breville Bambino for about 220 at Target and the Breville Bambino Plus for around 400 open box. I’m not sure if the Plus is worth the extra cost, especially since it’s open box, so any insight would help.

I also want to know what else I should buy so he’s fully set up. Do I need to get a grinder and whole beans, or is pre-ground coffee okay for beginners? (I know some people might consider that a sin, which is why I’m asking lol.) And what tools or accessories are actually necessary for someone just starting out, like a tamper, milk pitcher, scale, or anything else?

Any advice from people who’ve helped someone start their first setup would be super helpful. I just want to get him something good that’s easy to use without overwhelming him. Thanks.",1,1763884075.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1p4gvxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusinessindia/comments/1p4gvxs/a_tale_of_interior_designer_working_on_own/,A tale of interior designer working on own,"As an architectural designer, I started my career parallel to my Bachelor's of Design in university. The one-year design diploma gave me the privilege to join a firm as a part-time intern with 5K a month, working 6–7 hours. There wasn’t any role called “part-time designer” back then.

The same space acted as my studio to work on my university assignments.
So I felt it more like home than my home — where late night hip-hop music with a mug full of coffee and working on sketches was considered sinful in the older part of Hyderabad. And people thought it had no future.

So I preferred staying back at the same place most of the time. I later got promoted to Junior Designer and then left that space as a grown-up man from a teen, with a bit more energy, after working for three years.

Yes, I am grateful about this boss — but he’s not the one I’m talking about.

Later, I moved to a new job with an upgrade in my salary. This time it was in Jubilee Hills. A fancy office where I got my coffee as soon as I entered, colleagues ordering fancy food, formal invitations for weekend parties, and night stays at their place.

I was a bit hesitant — coming from the older part, with responsibilities, and with a hunger to be a great designer like my gurus one day. This dream stopped me from being part of that lifestyle. And my economic bike wasn’t looking great parked beside BMWs and Benzes.

Thank God for this opportunity though — I got exposure to conceptual design, real interior projects, not something like Livespace or Homelane (which also have good designs in their own segment).

My biggest flex was working on a 45-crore residence and a 20-crore commercial space as a lead designer.

No, I’m not talking about this boss either.

New year came with new opportunities. The desperate me, wanting to be part of good designers, ended up in firms where clients weren’t respected, projects were done only for the sake of portfolio and money. Everything was pushed on me because I was the Senior Designer. And each client had the same issue:
“Why can’t we get what we need?”
“Why isn’t your head taking or having meetings with us?”

Slowly I felt I was being used. The toxic culture and office politics were killing the designer in me. A greedy soul was waking up, thinking this is the right way.

Here comes the major step 🪜
I quit — despite getting the best salary, a senior position, and a fancy Volvo office car for site visits (which was way more comfortable and amazing than my humble economic bike).
Yet I decided to quit, leaving two months’ salary behind. I don’t regret it.

Obviously, this boss is not the one I’m talking about, and definitely not the one I am happy about.

So which boss then?

This passionate guy hired me when I had no clue where to go.
The journey started in 2022 as a freelancer with him. After a little confidence and previous experience, he decided to give me more responsibilities with one rule:

No day is off.
Each call is important.
Each client is the first client.
No project is small.
And every penny and second matters.

I was motivated. I felt the same energy as my first part-time job. I decided to take it on despite getting only 25% of the salary I used to get as a senior designer. My parents were definitely not happy — about him and about me.

I started working, and it turned out to be great.
He was there with me each day, each second, whenever I needed.

I was left with my own responsibility, freedom to take decisions, and a creative approach — something none of the firms I worked with since 2016 ever gave me.

He rewarded me with a two-month break. A solo trip to Uttarakhand after working for two years — in 2024. We had great moments, ups and downs, and we celebrated everything together.

This year started slow, yet he was still there, never leaving me alone.

Even though he paid a little less compared to the last two years, I decided not to give up. I stuck with him because he was the reason I could make my parents happy by contributing to the first home we are getting for ourselves — the elder son responsibility, done.

Now I am grateful for the step of quitting and joining him. He didn’t have an office, yet I was happy. I had to manage my lunch outdoors, yet I was comfortable. And my payment was done last, after paying all the team — still I am happy from the bottom of my heart.

Because…

I decided to be with him forever, till the end, whatever happens.

Yes, I can do that — because this boss is me.

I got hired by myself, with a strong belief in me, back in 2022.
Touch wood — happy and prosperous.

I may grow slowly,
I may see less CTC compared to others,
I may have to work on Sundays like today, as I’m writing this from the metro 🚇 going to a site.

But all this fades each night when I see myself living the life I wanted as a designer — the one I manifested back in 2016.

And the best part?
This dude is getting his own studio next year. It’s the biggest gift ever.

To each self-employed soul out there — this little story is for you, specially.
To each individual who supported me and continues to support me — just like u/Turtle_Fin and others — I don’t have words to convey my love.

To those who trust someone like me in any form of work — you’re not just supporting; you are becoming part of their dreams.

Until next time,
May the force be with you all — and with me.

1p4gv5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1p4gv5n/tipping_culture/,Tipping culture,"So I’ve been noticing this creeping “Americanized” tipping culture here, and honestly… it’s starting to irritate me.

Whenever I pay by card now, I’m suddenly presented with these preset tipping buttons, 0% 5%, 10%, 15%, whatever. If I want to tip, I can decide myself and say the amount out loud. I don’t need a touchscreen guilt-tripping me. It feels like this subtle capitalism-pressure that doesn’t fit Dutch culture at all.

Another thing: I genuinely don’t know where these pin tips go.
When I worked in a bar years ago, cash tips were just split evenly. Simple. Fair.
But the pin tips? I literally never saw a cent. My instinct is that they go straight to the already well-earning owner rather than the staff.

And tipping for small things , like just grabbing a quick coffee, also feels like a new trend. When did that become a thing? Are we seriously drifting toward US norms?

For the record: in proper restaurants with good service I always tip. No issue with that. A nice bar experience as well.  But having to decline a tip every single time I tap my card is getting pretty tiring.

Curious: how do you all feel about this? Are you as done with it as I am, or am I just being grumpy?

Tips and recommendations,"Are portable induction stoves reliable (last for many years to come, low failure rate) and are there any that can be considered BIFL self-serviceable with e.g. replaceable parts?

I don't like to reduce what I own and I'm thinking a good portable induction stove would be a good investment for things like hotpot, camping, and even replace my existing electric kettle (which would be nice because I prefer keeping dedicated appliances to a minimum and the electric kettle has a plastic washer/seal that protects the temperature sensor (I suspect all electric kettles that have temperature controls have this and I would like to avoid hot liquid on plastic). Also my $150 Stagg EKG kettle sensor reports its temperatures all over the place before supposedly hitting the target temperature so I don't really trust it or electric kettles in general anymore. A stovetop kettle with a thermometer would be more versatile alternative as it could go on gas stove and induction.

Not sure what to look for in a good portable induction stove or particular brands to pay attention to (I'm from the US if availability is a concern). I have an old one with only presets on the power control like ""frying"", ""simmer"", and ""boiling"" which is not acceptable because I need much finer control (to heat water to an accuracy of a single degree Celsius if possible for e.g. brewing tea/coffee. I suppose it's as finicky as a gas stove and you would need to just take the kettle off the burner as soon as it hits target temp?).

I assume an electric kettle is no more efficient at heating water than an induction stove or that they are very comparable cost-efficiency wise (not a big ideal since electric bills is nowhere near as high as in Europe but just curious).

From constant adverts, sponsorships, roadway billboards, use in television and films.

But with zero education or warnings.

Younger and younger people are dragging down the average of diagnosis. They are first presenting with far more advanced disease.

When countries turned on the tobacco industry it was plain olive boxes with horrific images, television commercials with people talking through a hole in the throat etc

Where is the education for young people on this silent killer? Why are there no advertisements showing decomp patients talking about what they wish they knew then what they know now.

I know there’s endless lobbyists and a tax base but so did the smoking industry.

I’m not saying prohibition or whatever I’m just saying education.

Encourage the youth to get an annual met panel free on the government. Encourage it, incentivize it. Ironically it would save the government money.

California is out nearly $8m because I didn’t get a met panel ever until I threw up coffee grounds.

Something has to give because the more and more cirrhotic livers we get the less and less transplant livers there’ll be and it will become a horrific crisis. There aren’t enough livers as is.

Luka had asked me to grab his wallet from the car while he was on a work call, and as I reached into the center console, a folded paper slipped out. I wouldn't have thought anything of it if the word 'jewelry' hadn't caught my eye.

There it was in black and white: two identical silver necklaces purchased on the same day three weeks ago. The delicate silver chain with the small crescent moon pendant—the one Luka had fastened around my neck two weeks ago with a kiss and whispered words about a ""spontaneous romantic gesture.""

Except it hadn't been spontaneous at all. And there were two of them.

My fingers trembled as I refolded the receipt and placed it in my pocket. I tried to focus on normal tasks for the rest of the afternoon—answering emails, preparing dinner, smiling when Luka emerged from his home office—but the receipt burned like a hot coal in my pocket.

""You okay?"" Luka asked, coming up behind me as I chopped vegetables with more force than necessary. ""You seem tense.""

I turned to face him, studying the face I'd loved for five years. ""Who got the second necklace, Luka?""

His expression shifted so quickly I might have missed it if I hadn't been watching so carefully—confusion, recognition, then carefully composed neutrality.

""What are you talking about?"" His voice was steady, but his eyes darted away from mine.

I pulled the receipt from my pocket and unfolded it. ""Two identical silver crescent moon necklaces. You only gave me one. So who got the other?""

""Oh, that."" He laughed, but it sounded hollow. ""I bought a backup. In case you didn't like the first one, or if something happened to it.""

He reached for the receipt, but I pulled it back. His eyes couldn't meet mine for more than a second.

""You're lying,"" I said quietly. ""You've never bought backup jewelry before.""

""Kyla, come on."" He ran his hand through his hair—his nervous tell. ""Why are you making this into something it's not?""

""Because you're lying to me right now, and we both know it.""

The conversation went in circles after that. Luka growing more defensive, his explanations becoming more elaborate yet less convincing. I went to bed that night with a knot in my stomach, the kind of dread that comes when you know something is wrong but can't quite name it yet.

The next morning, I waited until Luka was in the shower—the long, hot shower he took every day before work. I'd never checked his phone before. Five years together, and I'd respected his privacy completely. But the second necklace nagged at me, a loose thread I couldn't help but pull.

His phone was on the nightstand, face down. No password—we'd both always kept our phones open to each other, a symbol of trust I realized was about to be shattered.

I went straight to his messages. And there she was—Brielle Cooper. His young subordinate at work. The one he'd mentioned casually over the past few months. Too casually, I now realized.

The thread went back months. Daily messages that started innocently enough but had evolved into something else entirely.

""Good morning, beautiful,"" he'd written just yesterday at 7:15 AM, before he'd even gotten out of bed beside me.

""Can't stop thinking about our talk yesterday. You understand me in ways no one else does,"" she'd written last week.

""Saved you the last donut from the meeting. It's in my office drawer whenever you want to come by ;)"" he'd texted three days ago.

And then I saw it—a photo from exactly two weeks ago. Brielle wearing a silver necklace with a crescent moon pendant. Identical to mine. ""Love my spontaneous gift,"" read her caption. ""Our special connection means everything.""

I felt physically ill, scrolling through message after message. Inside jokes. Late-night texts. Plans to meet for coffee before work. Nothing explicitly sexual, but the intimacy was unmistakable. The emotional connection. The secrecy.

The shower turned off. I placed his phone exactly as I'd found it and walked to the kitchen on legs that felt like they might give way beneath me. Five years. An engagement ring on my finger. A shared home. A shared future—or so I'd thought.

And all the while, he'd been building a secret relationship with another woman. Sending her the same gifts. Giving her the same words.

I’ve recently fallen deep into the rabbit hole of coffee roasting, and I’m hoping to get some guidance from people who are actually doing this day-to-day.

Right now I’m at the very early learning stage. I’ve been reading The World Atlas of Coffee by James Hoffmann, watching a bunch of YouTube roasting breakdowns, and starting to brew more intentionally. I’m mainly using a V60 with the 4:6 method just so I can get familiar with flavor clarity… but honestly, I’m struggling to pick up the tasting notes and aromas that roasters describe on their bags.

I know this part takes practice, but I don’t really have a framework for how to train my palate.
So I’d love advice on:

1. How to understand aroma better
Any sensory kits, exercises, routines, or even day-to-day habits that helped you actually build aroma recognition? I feel like I’m not connecting the dots yet.

2. How to understand taste + identify notes
Is there a structured way to practice cupping and building a flavor vocabulary? Should I roast the same bean in multiple ways and compare? I want to be able to tell what’s happening in the cup instead of just guessing.

3. Roasting machine for practice
I’m considering a 1kg Aillio Bullet so I can learn seriously from the start. Is this too much for a beginner? Will what I learn on it translate to larger commercial machines later on?

4. What beans should a beginner roast?
Should I begin with cheaper greens purely for practice? Or start with good-quality washed coffees so I can actually taste the differences in my roast decisions? Any origins that are “friendly” for learning?

5. What to do with the beans I roast while practicing? & How to judge if a roast was good
Since I’ll be doing a lot of trial-and-error batches, what do beginners usually do with all the coffee? Do you drink everything yourself, share with friends, compost it, or keep it for reference?
Also — how do you objectively evaluate whether a roast was good or not? I’ve seen people talk about cupping scores, comparing multiple batches side-by-side, looking at roast curves, analyzing bean color, checking for even development, etc., but as a beginner I don’t know what criteria to actually focus on first. Any tips on how to analyze roasts better so I can improve with intention rather than randomly tweaking things?

My long-term goal is to eventually open a small roastery, but right now I just want to build a solid foundation — sensory skills, green bean understanding, roast theory, all of it. Books are great but I know the real learning comes from experience, so I’d really appreciate insights from people who’ve already walked this path.

Thanks in advance — excited to learn from all of you!",3,1763883492.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

(I got both),"TLDR: Is it crazy to want to keep the LatteGo over the ENA 8? What am I gaining or losing by choosing one over the other? The ENA 8 is good, but is it worth keeping when making lattes or cappuccinos feels like a chore?



I’ve had the Jura ENA 8 for a little over two years. I drink one or two lattes every day, iced in the summer and hot in the winter. The ENA 8 was my upgrade from the Breville Barista Express after using that one for many years.



The ENA 8 has been great for the most part, especially in summer. It gives me tasty espresso shots and good coffee. As you know, though, it needs a separate milk jug or cooler, and you have to clean the hose (?) with the cleaning beads every time. It got so annoying that I started going to the Starbucks across the street in the winter for my morning latte.



So now I have the Philips LatteGo 3200. I’ve tried most of the drinks on it, mainly hot lattes. It might not be as good as a café made by a careful barista, but it’s close enough to Starbucks. For the price, I really don’t have complaints, especially since I’ll be making hot lattes at least twice a day.

Nothing flashy, nothing over-produced — just real work happening in real time. I’m juggling multiple pipelines, refining prompts, weaving Warp/Yarn/Shuttle, and tightening up the scaffolding for local-first intelligence.

If you’re into:

🧠 hybrid memory  
🕸️ graph + vector integration  
🧭 interpretable planning  
🚦 Shuttle orchestration  
🛡️ agent sandboxing  
🪚 AST-safe transformations  
🪢 braid-based narrative logic  
🧩 metaprompt refinement  
⚛️ symbolic-semantic fusion

…you’ll probably feel at home.

This is part devlog, part experiment, part “let’s see what breaks if I push it.” Sometimes everything flows. Sometimes the system freezes because I’m running too many processes at once. Either way, it’s honest builder energy.

Main goals tonight:  
• tune the Shuttle  
• clean up end-of-week token output  
• tighten graph intersections  
• test new refinement loops  
• maybe rant about democratizing AI if I get philosophical at 2am

If you want to hang out in the workshop, ask questions, or just lurk while I weave threads together, you’re welcome.

Come sit by the loom — the coffee’s strong and the math gets weird in a good way.

It was 10:47 pm, raining, and my scrubs smelled like formalin and cheap coffee.
We’d just gotten our first block grades back. Everyone was huddled over their phones, comparing percentages. Mine was… bad. Not just “oh no, I’m not top of the class” bad. It was “if this keeps happening, I might actually fail out” bad.
I drove to the far end of the parking lot, turned the engine off, and just sat there. No music. No podcast. Just this loud thought in my head:
“You are not cut out for this. You made a huge mistake.”
I opened my bag and pulled out the same thick stack of color-coded notes I’d been rewriting for weeks. They looked beautiful. They had not helped me at all.
That was the first time I admitted to myself that the way I’d studied my entire life wasn’t going to work here.
The next day, instead of hiding, I went to a classmate who’d crushed the exam and asked, “What are you doing that I’m not?”
He shrugged and said, “Honestly? Less. I read once, then I live in question banks. I screw up questions, then I ask why. I keep drilling the same weak topics until I can actually explain them.”
It sounded too simple. But I went home, closed my note-taking tab, and opened questions for the first time before reading.
For a week, I felt even dumber. I missed everything. I kept a little notebook where I wrote down “things I was embarrassingly wrong about today.”
But slowly, sitting in lecture started to feel different. I could hear the question stems hidden inside the slides. The next quiz I didn’t destroy it, but I passed. The exam after that I was solidly average.
Now I’m halfway through MS2. I still park in that same spot sometimes after late labs. The difference is I no longer sit there wondering if I should quit. I sit there exhausted, sure, but also… proud.
That night in the parking lot felt like an ending. It turned out to be the point where I finally stopped trying to be the prettiest note-taker and started trying to be a real student.

I always recall the significance of the roles played by Hartnett, Bana, Sizemore, Fichtner and the nearly (dark) comic relief provided by Bremner's performance (his role as Nelson being one of my favorites of the film to this day) but like a fine wine, it would take time for the careers of the many other actors to bring attention to their parts on subsequent watchings. 

  
It started with Orlando Bloom, of course, as well as Ewan McGregors. My mom being a fan of crime dramas would also highlight Enrique Muricano's role. Im sure I recognized Jeremy Piven and and Ioan Gruffud, but it wasnt until a conversation last night that inspired a re-watching today that really highlighted the absurdity of the cast. 

I always thought Orlando Bloom's role was comically short, but Gruffud's has him absolutely beat at a single scene and he was the far more established actor of the two (*BHD* is Bloom's second credit according to wikipedia while Gruffud had several, including *Titanic*). Piven spends most of the film deceased, while inversely Ewan McGregor plays a huge role that I somehow never noticed before (even though I recall numerous iconic scenes incolving his character, my brain somehow never managed to put two and two together). This makes sense as he was already at the height of his early success but mystifies me that young-me never even realized Obi Wan Kenobi was ""the coffee guy"" and that the coffee guy proceeded to continue on in the movie until the end.. 

  
All that brings me to the latest: ""Ty Burrell is in Black Hawk Down?"" I exclaimed when I heard. ""Where?"" Well, it takes nearly forever for him to show up, and I think he has a grand total of three scenes, but yes, the dad from Modern Family is indeed in the movie.

  
Secondly is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, famous to many for his role as Jamie Lannister, he was lost in his character to me until now, portraying one of the two Delta Snipers who attempt to secure the Super Six Four until reinforcements can arrive. Did you know that? I do now!

  
Lastly theres Tom Hardy in his film debut. Before Star Trek. Hidden in plain sight as he forms the straight man of the comedic duo of the film (as much as they can be called that) alongside Ewan Bremner's, Nelson. Yes the guy who deafened Bremner's character was Hardy. 

  
Bonus points for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it Corey Johnson.

If you are a US citizen working fully remote or living abroad and still domiciled in a high tax state, the math is kind of brutal.

Say you earn 180000 a year W2 or 1099.

You sit in a state with around 8 percent income tax.

That is about 14400 every year going to the state on top of federal and everything else.

Now zoom out.

Ten years of that is 144000.

If you had invested that at around 6 percent annual return, you are looking at roughly 190,000 plus instead of zero.

Stretch that to twenty years and the same 14400 a year turns into something close to 530000.

That is half a million just from redirecting state tax into an index fund.

This is where domicile comes in. Florida has zero state income tax and is friendly to people who are nomadic or living abroad. If your life is already mostly online and you are not emotionally married to your old state, switching domicile is basically a long term yield play. Lower annual drag on your income, more compounding.

The annoying part is not the idea, it is the paperwork. Changing license, declaration of domicile, address everywhere, making sure your old state cannot claim you are still a resident. I have been digging into it and there are services like [SavvyNomad](https://savvynomad.io/) that structure the Florida move for you with address, DMV prep and so on, which is helpful if you don't want to invent the process from scratch. Still, you need a good expat CPA and you need to understand your old state rules, but it turns a vague idea into a checklist.

From a purely financial angle though, the question in my head is pretty simple

On top of that left dry with nothing a hurt ego an self esteem issues. Mean while she was living her picture perfect life with the junkie who claims he was clean an wouldn’t hit her again so she told him the kid was his. Well I texted her about 2-3 months later asking if she would be willing to sign for a divorce. She replied within minutes! “Yup” I said okay and blocked her number the next day I went to file. From that point I put that I wanted a dna test in the court order. We went to court the just for the judge to tell me they will not proceed with Marie being pregnant so they set the date a month after the due date. In the time waiting I ran into Marie an her junkie boyfriend getting her morning coffee i was once buying for her. Just drove right by smiling. We went to court for the second type, while we was there th judge asked if there was any children of the marriage after swearing under oath. My “then wife” looks me dead square in the eye looks at the judge an says no there’s no children of marriage. That was truly when I broke inside.

left running in a locked garage,  
revving, choking on its own noise  
while the rest of me stalls on the side of the road.

Thoughts blur into tail-lights,  
red and unending,  
a highway where every sign points to nowhere  
and every exit is already closed.

“There’s no more time,” they whisper,  
like a countdown only I can hear.  
“You’ll always be alone,”  
like a truth carved into bone.

And I try to remember  
what happy felt like.  
Not the small kind,  
not the two-minute kind that vanishes  
before the coffee cools,  
but the kind that stayed.  
The kind that sat beside me  
and didn’t rush out the door  
when the night got heavy.

But memory is fog now,  
and every time I reach for it  
my hands pass through.

They say it takes fewer muscles to smile  
than to frown,  
but nobody ever talks about  
how exhausted the face becomes  
when it’s been pretending for years.  
When even the smallest lift of the lips  
feels like lifting a skyline.

My frown…  
it just happens.  
Like gravity.  
Like something natural.  
Like something I don’t need  
to force.

And even when people are around me  
my loneliness walks ahead,  
introduces itself first,  
takes up the space I was meant to fill.

I think about the people  
I used to call at 2am.  
The ones who would answer,  
even when they were tired,  
even when the world was loud.  
They have new lives now.  
Bigger lives.  
Full tanks.  
Bright dashboards.

I don’t blame them.  
I just sit here  
on the shoulder of my own life  
watching their tail-lights  
become stars.

Maybe I’ve always been running  
on a quarter tank.  
Maybe I was built that way,  
a little less fuel,  
a little more distance,  
and no instructions on how to refuel.

And still, somehow,  
I keep driving.

Not because I’m strong.  
Not because I want to.  
Just because  
the engine won’t turn off.",2,1763879582.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

The date went well, great conversation, no awkward silence yadda yadda. I asked her on a second date and she said yes, sweet. (The location of the second date was already selected via text) 

She mentioned she was hanging out with friends the night of our date.

A few days later she canceled our date plans stating that she didn’t feel romantic chemistry. Which is fine, but I’m curious to know why then she said yes to a second date then cancelled on me a few days after the first date saying she didn’t have romantic feelings. Maybe she said yes to me when I asked her on a second date because rejecting people in person is hard and it’s easier to say yes than cancel later over text? 

Maybe I answered my own question? Or maybe her friends talked her out of seeing me? I’m not upset over this but I’m honestly just curious and wanted to get some thoughts from strangers on the internet instead of getting AI psychosis.

1p4flpa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4flpa,It came from Transylvania,"I opened up this wonderous package I received for Waffels. It even included a waffle. There is a US Menu 2 Pork Rib that he and I are doing something with, along with a Portuguese Army and Romanian rations that were sadly raided. I won't let that stop me from enjoying the leftover goodies in them. Since they were already opened I decided to take a peek inside and found all kinds of stuff. These are also my first (and hopefully not last) from both countries. Holy shit the Portuguese ration has an ass load of cookies and crackers and a fucking juice box. I'm super excited for it and it's chilling in the fridge. Weirdly enough only a small amount of jams for all those cookies. No worries though as I have plenty from mystery boxes. There's a nice assortment of drinks with tea, coffee, isotonics and the juice box. Also canned sardines but the canned squid was raided. Not sure if customs didn't realize it was seafood or was just hungry. Oh well. I have a really nice can of squid in its own ink to eat anyway. It also came with a high energy chocolate survival bar and I thought the packaging looked familiar. Pics 5 & 6 are the Portuguese one next to a PLA one. I'm pretty sure that one of the companies owns the other one. The menu looked fire for this one. 

The Romanian one has to be the biggest outer bag I have so far except for maybe the huge Dutch? one with all the add-ons. I pulled those out as well. This is all made by Rationtech who also make MREs for various African and Middle Eastern militaries. They're based in South Africa but appear to have expanded in Europe with an office in The Netherlands. Basically it comes in a huge outer bag with the meals bagged inside. It might be the next best packaging after Canada. The bags are rip top with a Ziploc closure. All the drinks are gussetted bags and in general it's just well packed. You also get four FRHs and they're huge. They're big enough for the main and the drink. There's two 3-in1 coffees and a hot chocolate beverage. Again this menu looked really good too.
