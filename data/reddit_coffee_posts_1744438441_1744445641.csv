1jxcap3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxcap3,Recap of my march Trip!,"H√¶, i wanted to give you a small recap about my solo Trip in mid march!
I try to separate it in Reykjavik, Tours and Nice Tipps/Places!
I also don't had a structure apart from my Tours and the Airbnb 

Tldr: Magnificat country with such a cool vibe and, whats kinda important to me, you also have the Nature Like 5min away.
Nearly everything that i read 2-3 Times here in the Reddit was true, so use the search function and youll get a LOT of Informations!:)

Reykjavik and Start 

Where do i start? Ah yes. 7am fly and i arrived at around 11am. I probaly never saw a smaller international Airport than Keflav√≠k, but its still really cozy and the Flybus Transport is also unmissable, which helps a Lot!

After i arrived at my Airbnb (ik about all the bad things with Airbnb. I talked about this w many locals and can really understand the Point. Hopefully the government will do something ü´°) i had ""ah lets see everything"" Motivation. Thanks for my Central place it was really easy and there is a big Point: Everywhere, ofc especial in Downtown, is so much stuff to See! Streetarts, Architecture, places with a lot of history, many small, cozy museums (live art, Photographie, Punk etc. ) or bars/restaurant etc. Ofc after some days you can see everything, but i still enjoyed the vibe there more and had fun in visiting the Sun Voyager like 5-6 Times. üòÑ
So i spent some days in Reykjavik and looked through the city. 
Then my Tours started and they get their own part in this text. 
In Reykjavik itself you're really fast out of the Downtown trouble. (Tbf the real trouble starts at like 11pm weekends/Friday but still a lot less than in many other places) 
This allows you to see different lagoons, outer parts of the city or even things like Vi√∞ey relative alone. Btw Vi√∞ey is really cool and there stuff is also pretty nice. Easy enjoyable for 2-3 hours:).
Long story short, you need to find what you like. 
For me it was to see the city, culture and nature and not to drink a lot (also too poor for this lmao). If you like, ofc you can, but I cant give you some highlights, but apart from that....
1) Penis Museum. Yeah, random. Yeah, weird. But really interesting and if you smile it's really nice and for around 2000 Krones really affordable!
2) Vi√∞ey. They deserve their own section as i really liked the nature there. Nobody was there and you can just walk on a island with that much history.
3) National Museum. Gives you such a lot information about the history with many artefacts which i liked! Bit expensive but still really good.
4) Get a scooter and drive along the city. You can get from Vi√∞ey to the old harbor and see such a lot of Things like Hofoi, Harpa etc. which gives you a amazing view!
5)Old Harbor. Just amazing to zoom out, get a bank and chill there without sounds. Loved it!
6) Food. Big Topic and i try to give you the opinion without restaurants (only food walk). Ofc there are hyped Places like brau√∞ and BBP, but they are just really good. Brau√∞ has a apart from the cinnamon rolls (vegan and normal amazing!) really good stuff and feel free to try everything. BBP is cheap and tastes well, so also highly recommend! You also cant do anything wrong with Mandi or some ice cream and waffles but i found them slightly too expensive but still a good deal.
For real cheap stuff go to bonus as they easily saved my wallet. Sandwiches, the 8472 skyr types and appelsinn probably saved me many euros. Still bit more expensive than at home but go to them and get hraun:)
7) CAT CAF√â! Easy top 3 highlight. Get a coffee, a cake and chill there with some cats. Its so chill and you have time to come down with a cute cat.:) Also that you can adopt this cats makes it a really nice concept and i would recommend it everyone.

Ofc there is a lot more like the Harpa ( HAMMPARAT was really interesting üòÇ), Lagoons but this comes first to my mind. üòÖ 
Just enjoy the history their and try to collect every street artü•π

Tours:

Expensive but worth, sometimes felt a bit weird.
Also I highly recommend smaller groups as it just feels better idk. 

First one was, of course, northern lights. Ik its luck and tbf it was just for the experience at minimum. All in all pretty cool but it also depends on whos your tour guide, how they prepare and I'm really sure that this is something that is better when you do it yourself!
We saw them, but i just feel that this, apart from the hunting experience, a bit more expensive.

I found a Brewery tour and as a German...well I at least had to try it. Shout outs to Oli, a really cool tour guide that showed me 3 cool bars and introduced me to the craft beer culture. Not my personal favourite but really drinkable. Their pils, really popular in Germany, is also pretty good. Not the best in my life but with the vibe in a smaller Icelandic bar w many locals doable. Price wise easily worth it as you would pay the same amount for the beer alone. 

Food walk is your classic stuff that you see everywhere but also worth it. 3 hours of culture, food in restaurants (which i avoided because of money), Tipps for the city and a nice guide (Shout out Hilda, amazing new Guide with a fresh attitude. She was just part of our mixed group by the end)
The food itself is good and even the fermented shark is fine. Smells like shit too! Highly recommend this tour and is really worth the money 

Golden circle. I dont need to say anything about this. My only big group tour and still amazing. You see a lot of things here in the Reddit and everything is so amazing in real life. Just get this tour...yes it is loaded but really beautiful ü•π! Shout out to Denis too! Cool guy with such a lovely smile.

Westcoast tour with a Lava cave was something were i was not really hyped but it turns out that this was the second best Day in Iceland. 
Amazing nature with less people and enough space for everything. Yea you drive a lot but its amazing to see the nature, black beaches, churches in such a peace! 
Lava cave was interesting while a bit short. Really cool experience and would also do it again if im there! Cold too there
But the real highlight was the Guide Roberto. This guy managed to interact with everyone if you want to, had a big knowledge about everything and helped with things like organisation, time schedule and what you can see.
After i forgot my wallet in the bus he drove back to my bus stop and brought it back. Fair to say that I hugged him a bit, Amore Mio Roberto! ü´°
Expensive but worth!

The highlight was easily the south side with the Katla ice cave.
Seljalandsfoss, Sk√≥garfoss are amazing by themselve apart from the fact that Seljalandsfoss has flooded my clothing. But to stand behind a waterfall, enjoy the nature while getting weter than everything ist something that I'll never forget. A small walk around the waterfall but lifetime experience for me.
Sk√≥garfoss is also sooo cool and a story for itself, just enjoy both!
Black Beach at rain and yellow alarm is also really cool and something different what you see on Instagram or so. But one thing is the same: Stupid People that try be better than the nature but this comes in my final part.
For me jt was amazing to see everything and enjoy the waves, black dust beautiful! 
In addition to the cat caf√© and Seljalandsfoss was the Katla ice cave tour my third highlight.
You just start in vik and drive on the volcano area and then walk on Katla and in the cave
The whole process of walking up- the mountain, stand inside of a cave with amazing ice structure and have this amazing view is something that I'll never forget and I'm grateful to see this!
Also Bar√∞a is a amazing swiss guy that guided our smaller group perfectly with humor! ü•π
Pretty expensive too but would spend it again, again....

Conclusion
Its a perfect mixture of nature and city.
Of course there are some disadvantages like everywhere. Airbnb and the costs for example.
But all in all, I think it's really nice if you try to not be an asshole, respect the culture and maybe bring in yourself into the life/language. 
I saw sooo many people on the black beach that nearly got caught by waves, stand at a cliff or thought that signs are not necessary. Also just put your trash in a bin and dont interact with the locals in a way that there lookin like a slave. Really awkward.
This was, luckily, not everywhere and the nature itself was amazing. You can just chill and there are many places in Reykjavik like Ab√¶er that gives you a other view apart from the tourist stops if you want to. So just explore and I'm sure you gonna find something that nobody has seen before!
This was also just Reykjavik mostly and I'm happy to see the rest of this beautiful country in my future ‚ù§Ô∏è

I could talk hours about it, but I hope you got a small overview about my days, my highlights and what I would recommend. Feel free to ask any questions!!

Small sidenotes:
Perlan is really cool but damn. 6300krones is expensive.
Icelandic music is something different but Hammapart in Harpa was interesting and not bad!
Get a soup in a bread, amazing!
There are a lot of souvenirs...just get what you like. Ive got some funny Pullovers, Liqueur (good), scarf and snacks. So stuff that I can really use. Tbf you can get many nice things like salt, Jewellery and so on there, just try to avoid scammy shit!
Get sandwiches in bonus!
Prepare for the weather, as you can have every weather on a day. No joke
Don't be scared if you are introvert or so as everything is doable and they are really cool with everything:)
Don't be sad when it goes back..ü•≤ 

Love you guys ü•π

1jxc63k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1jxc63k/hugh_pb_and_sub_90_for_the_heart_surgery_comeback/,Hugh PB and sub 90 for the heart surgery comeback! | Berlin Half,"## The background story

This story starts at the end of 2023, when I registered myself for the Vienna City Marathon 2024. I started training for the marathon in February. However, the training did not go according to plan. Tempos at marathon pace felt like 5k or 10k pace. Intervals I had to stop or run much slower than before. One time I managed to push through an interval at the planned pace and my vision went black for a moment. At first, I thought it was mental, that I just couldn't push the pace after my last marathon block + recovery time. So I decided to test my fitness at a local race. Every little climb felt like a mountain and every time I tried to push beyond a certain pace, something in my brain/body told me that this pace was impossible to maintain and I had to slow down. When the finish line was in sight I started my finishing kick, but I had to abort and walk across the finish line. I felt like I had a lot of energy left, but I just couldn't put it out. I ended up with a finishing time of 52:XX for 10.6k, while my 10k was around 42:45. But now I was sure that it was not mental and that the problem was somewhere else.

The next few days I went to the doctor and got my blood levels checked. It turned out that I had a massive iron deficiency (Ferritin < 5). Problem found, I started taking iron supplements and the story could end here. My doctor also sent me to a cardiologist, to make sure everything was okay with my heart since I am an athlete. At first, I did not want to go because I already felt better after 2 weeks of iron supplementation. But it was only an appointment, so why not go, even if it is useless? After I explained to the cardiologist why I was there and that the problem had already been found, he was also pretty sure that everything was ok. He explained that without iron it would be impossible to run faster because it transports oxygen to the muscles. But since I am here, let us have a quick look at my heart.

During the echocardiogram I had a little conversation with him until we ran out of things to talk about. He looked at the screen intently and I tried to read his face. When he was finished, he told me to wait outside his office and we would talk about the results. I still thought everything was fine. After waiting far too long, I was finally called into his office. He invited me to sit down, then made a serious face and said: ""Mr. X, I regret to inform you that you have a congenital heart problem"". Suddenly I could not breath for a moment and almost started to cry. He then went on to explain the exact nature of my problem (aortic valve insufficiency) and that it could be corrected by surgery. He also told me that it would be better if I did not run the marathon or did any intense sports. After the appointment, I just had to go for a walk to get over the whole situation. The next day the cardiologist called me and I asked him, if I could run easy for 3-4 times in a week. He agreed, probably because he knew that I would go crazy, if I could not run.

After about a month, I had my first appointment at the hospital, where the surgery would be done, for further diagnosis. After the examination (transesophageal echocardiogram) they discussed the possibilities with me. I could either wait for 5-10 years, not do any sports and then have the surgery or have the surgery now. Obviously I chose the immediate surgery. On the way home, the head doctor called me and told me that she did not feel comfortable with me doing sports until the surgery. After a short discussion we agreed that I am allowed to run, if someone was with me. So I continued to run 4-5 times in a week to keep my mind calm until the surgery.

The day before my surgery I checked into the hospital. The medical team explained the procedure to me in detail. I was scheduled to undergo a median sternotomy to attempt a reconstruction of the aortic valve. If that did not work some any reason, I would need to receive a mechanical heart valve instead. My surgery was postponed twice due to emergencies and I had to wait for 2 long days more. But on the third day, my time finally arrived.

## The Surgery

26.07.2024 - ??? 27.07.2024 - I am alive. That's enough for today. The reconstruction failed and I now have a mechanical heart valve 28.07.2024 - Existing is exhausting. Taking some steps. 29.07.2024 - ""Is it normal that I hear my heart"" - ""You will get used to it"". I was on the toilet. Most exhausting thing I have ever done. 30.07.2024 - Hitting over 5k steps. 31.07.2024 - Going up some stairs. Felt like I was climbing a mountain. 01.08.2024 - Walking upstairs feels much easier today. 02.08.2024 - 7 days after the surgery I was sent home 05.08.2024 - Hit 10k steps for the first time. 12.08.2024 - 11.09.2024 In Germany we have this thing called ""Rehabilitation"". There you are guided back to a normal life. In my case that meant some endurance and strength training, some mental stuff about the hole situation and treatment because of the sternotomy. Started with 55 watts and ended with 155 watts of really easy cycling.

[Graph](https://imgur.com/a/ZmkZnGQ)

12.09.2024 - 25.10.2024 - Basically cycling 1 hour a day. Added some intensity the last 2 weeks. 26.10.2024 - My first run after the surgery. Easy 40 min, never felt so happy to run. All muscles and muscles that I didn't even know I had were sore. 27.10.2024 - Running again. Still sore and stiff, but mentally refreshing. After the first 8-10 runs, my muscles remembered how to run and I could just go out for easy runs without any major problems. 28.10.2024 - 27.01.2025 - Started with 3 runs a week, built up to 6. Somehow managed not to get injured, despite a lot of niggles. This is not entirely true, but I never had to miss more than 3 days. On the days where I did not run, I continued to cycle for at least 1 hour. 06.12.2024 - Had an appointment with my cardiologist to check on the post-op healing process. Everything is fine and he allowed me to do whatever I want (maybe I already did) 07.12.2024 - First race, a local 5k. Ran 21:49, still having an iron deficient, Ferritin was around 20 28.01.2025 - 02.02.2025 Forced break, because I am in the hospital again, not related to the heart this time. 03.02.2025 - Finally starting to train for the Berlin Half-Marathon

## The Training

For the training I decided to go with the sirpoc single threshold approach. Why? Because I just liked the simplicity of it. The blueprint for it is pretty simple. Run 1 hour easy or do one of these workouts every other day. Either 3x10 min, 10x3 min or 6x5min. Sunday is the long run of 90 min. Repeat this every week. However, I adapted this to my needs. I started with the 90 min long run and built it up to 2 hours, just because I like long runs. Sometimes I doubled on the easy days, but never exceeded 90 min in total. Occasionally did some strides, maybe every 10 days. Also did some strength training. For the training paces I guesstimated them. Did a mix of my 5k in December, the Garmin Prediction and feeling. Went with 4:25 - 4:35 for the 10 mins, 4:15 - 4:30 for the 5 mins and 4:05 - 4:15 for the 3 mins repeats. For the easy days and the long run it was just by feel, sometimes 5:20, other days like 6:40 pace. This is what a standard week looks like. MO - 1h Easy TU - 3x10 min WE - 1h Easy TH - 10x3 min FR - 1h Easy SA - 6x5 min SO - 90 min - 2 hour long run

On the Tuesday, 12 days out from the half marathon I was incredibly tired from work, so I decided to start my taper. Again I kept it simple and just followed the last days of the Pfitz 12/63 plan.

### Pre-race

On Friday I went to Berlin and did some sightseeing. Did a little shakeout run in the evening. The next day I headed to the Expo in the morning to grab my stuff. In the afternoon some more sightseeing with the family. At the end of the day a short shakeout run with some strides this time. I focused on eating a lot of carbs today, but not forcing it. I slept well, despite the pre-race nerves and the unknown environment. For breakfast, I had toast with jam and oats with yogurt and honey. Drank 2 coffees, tried to go to the bathroom three times, and then went to the start area. Dropped off my stuff and then did my warm-up which consisted of 2-3km of easy running and strides. Hit the porta-potty one last time and then it was time to race. The temperature was good, but there was an icy wind that made it feel much colder.

### Race

KM 1-5: I started in corral C, even behind the first 1:45 pace group. This meant for me that I had to dodge a lot of people and work my up front. It was certainly not the pace I was hoping to run, but it was better to start slower than too fast.

KM 5-10: After the first aid station, there was suddenly more space. I locked in my pace and just cruised along with all the other runners. Slurped my first gel at around the 7-8km mark. Still feeling good. Grabbed a cup of water at the 10k aid station.

KM 10-15: I lost my focus and slowed down a bit. The wind was blowing hard, but there were always people to draft. Just concentrating on catching one runner after the other. Took half of a caffeine gel at the 12km mark. Still feeling good aerobically, but my legs, especially my calves, were starting to fatigue. Missed the aid station at 14K, but instead of letting it affect me, I just thought it was only a half marathon and I didn't need the water to get through. Catching up with the first 1:35 pace group

KM 16-19: Starting to pick up the pace again. I caught the remaining 1:35 groups and focused on good form. This time I got a drink at the 17km aid station, which was mentally refreshing. I slurped down the other half of my gel. My only focus was to catch the next runner in front of me.

KM 19-21: Time for a long finishing kick. I sped up and told myself that there were not even 10 minutes left. Concentrating again on catching the people in front of me. After a long mental grind, I finally see the Brandenburg Gate and give it everything I have. Starting to sprint after going through the Gate. Finished with the timer just clicking over the 1:35 mark and I had no idea, what my final time was, but I was certainly proud of myself for the execution of the race. Still feels a little surreal.

### Post-race

After I grabbed my medal and something to eat and drink, I took some pictures and only then checked my time. 1:27:55! I can't believe it. It's amazing to see my progress from the surgery, where I needed a break after walking a few steps, to running a sub 90 half. I feel so much better than I did before the surgery and have found my joy in life and running again.

## Extra: The Nutrition

Well, the surgery finally fixed my relationship with food. Before, I would count calories and not eat more than what my Garmin said. In hindsight, I was probably underfueled as a result. After the surgery, I stopped counting. In the Rehabilitation I didn't prepared my own food, so there was no way to track it accurately. When I was at home, it was just too exhausting. I was still overwhelmed with my life, and cooking for myself was challenging enough. I had heart surgery, but the long time on the heart-lung machine screws your brain. I am now paying attention to whole, unprocessed foods with an emphasis on carbohydrates and proteins. No weight gain, no weight loss. Just feeling good and energized.",4,1744444363.0,AdvancedRunning,0,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt play sports and I don‚Äôt enjoy going to bars or parties so it‚Äôs really hard to meet new people outside of work.

I don‚Äôt mind your gender or location, everywhere in the world is welcomed, but I‚Äôd like to find people close to my age (+-5). I am happily in a relationship, and looking for platonic friends only. Long calls on discord, sharing youtube videos, gaming together or ranting about the current strange world we live in, all that good stuff.

I‚Äôm 30F currently living in the US west coast. I like science, art, and a nice long walk on a good day. Despite where I live I‚Äôm far from outdoorsy or sporty, more of a cafe, restaurant and friday night on my big couch with blanket kind of person. I‚Äôve lived in several different countries and always curious to learn about other people‚Äôs stories.

I‚Äôm generally a chill and friendly person. I wouldn‚Äôt describe myself as super introvert but I do enjoy alone time at home a bit too much and dislike loud party or huge crowds. I like a little bit of nature, nice beaches or short hikes, but for most of my free time I‚Äôm at home watching shows, gaming or occasionally doing something like painting or baking. 

Common hobbies I enjoy as well as many other people (I‚Äôll leave the specifics to private conversations): 
- Movies, tv shows, comedies
- Music, both listening and playing
- Food, coffee, and a nice cup of tea
- Video games, but not competitively
- Books and podcasts 
- Crafty things

Some less common things about me: 
- I travel quite a lot, and I‚Äôve lived in a couple different places across North America, Europe and Asia. I like different cultures and learning new things.
- Bo Burnham is one of my favorite comedians 
- Daniel Sloss is another one
- I don‚Äôt really watch anime except attack on titan is one of the best story I‚Äôve ever seen
- I just finished severance and it‚Äôs a good show
- Also just finished Project Hail Mary and I really like it
- I don‚Äôt follow any sports. Either you are the same or you have to accept I have very little interest and know nothing about it

Potentially controversial:
Here‚Äôs things that I really don‚Äôt vibe with and I want to put it out there first. You can disagree and that‚Äôs okay, it just means I‚Äôm not the friend you‚Äôre looking for.
- Smoking, vaping, and recreational drugs
- People with messy life or go for excessive drinking when bored
- People who believe in tarot cards, astrology or psychic stuff
- Deeply religious

Dressed in an exquisite gown, Jennifer fiddled with a tea set on the coffee table. She grabbed a teacup and thrust it clumsily at the person seated opposite her. ‚ÄúH-Have some t-tea.‚Äù  
  
While she stuttered, saliva trickled out of the corner of her mouth.  
  
Yet perhaps the most eye-catching thing about her was the set of intersecting scars on her face.  
  
‚ÄúHe's having me marry a fool so that he can express his gratitude?‚Äù Mitchell White ignored the childish woman before him as he flipped through a report on Jennifer Young.  
  
Then, he tossed the report aside while his mood turned sour.  
  
His expression hardened further as he recalled her IQ results.¬†*IQ = 50.*  
  
Mitchell could not deny that her looks were utterly incomparable. Still, the sight of her trickling saliva was a turn-off.  
  
The butler, James Ward, explained, ‚ÄúOld Mr. White said that Ms. Jennifer saved his life. So‚Äî‚Äù However, he trailed off mid-sentence.  
  
A month earlier, Mitchell's grandfather, Montgomery, had gone missing in the mountains during an ancestral pilgrimage.  
  
The Whites had spent several days searching for him in vain. Just as the situation seemed dire, Montgomery was carried home by a young woman, safe and alive.  
  
The woman was none other than Jennifer Young, who was seated opposite Mitchell.  
  
‚ÄúSo what? He's offering his grandson's hand in marriage as thanks?‚Äù  
  
Mitchell maintained his frosty demeanor while he got up from the couch. He could not be bothered to even spare a glance at Jennifer as he ordered, ‚ÄúGet her out of here.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúMr. Mitchell, b-but Ms. Young is already married to you.‚Äù As he said this, James whipped out the damning marriage certificate.  
  
Having expected Mitchell's objections, Montgomery had pre-emptively gotten the marriage certificate, leaving no room for his grandson to protest.  
  
The living room descended into an eerie silence at James' revelation.  
  
In a rage, Mitchell snatched the offending piece of paper from James' hand and took a look at it, wishing he could tear the certificates apart and render the marriage void.  
  
Meanwhile, James could only lower his head without saying any word.  
  
As a ruthless and prominent businessman, Mitchell's private life naturally invited gossip from the public. Rumors swirled about the reason for his bachelorhood at thirty-two years of age.  
  
In a bid to quash these rumors once and for all, Montgomery forced Mitchell down the aisle.  
  
No one could have imagined that he would marry his oldest grandson off to a dim-witted woman.  
  
‚ÄúIf you don't like tea, what about a lollipop?‚Äù  
  
Right then, Jennifer suddenly got up from her position near the coffee table and approached Mitchell. She stared at him with puppy eyes, holding a lollipop out as a peace offering.  
  
The moment Mitchell met her gaze, he felt goosebumps break out all over his skin.  
  
His germaphobia flared, and he immediately grabbed her outstretched hand before the sticky lollipop could touch his clothes.  
  
‚ÄúWhat are you standing around for? Bring her away! Clean this up!‚Äù Mitchell barked at James as he planned to shrug off Jennifer.  
  
Before he could move, however, Jennifer burst into heavy sobs and clung to his arm like a limpet. ‚ÄúHubby, why do you hate me? I only want to feed you a lollipop!‚Äù  
  
Tears streamed down her face as she wailed. In the next instant, she had wiped her tears and snot on Mitchell's suit.  
  
He stared at her wordlessly while James struggled to keep his laughter in check.

Not a coffee drinker but I enjoy regular black tea, and for evenings in Fall and Winter especially with the dry New Jersey Winter air and the heat pumping makes the air quality terrible so I like a hot cup of caffeine-free herbal tea some evenings to warm up after working outside in the cold and rain etc - I mixed a bunch of stuff together, rose hips, dried blueberries, dried jasmine flowers, cloves, etc a whole bunch of other stuff I forgot but it's nothing questionable of toxicity or anything and basically I just drink it to warm up and everything.

I didn't read the package, I just figured it's a caffeine free herbal tea, then I read the back and it seems pretty serious, albeit sorta stupidly written in chinglish, not to sound offensive, but I mean it's kinda amateur-written.

I googled each of the ingredients and from the quick googles, some also seem toxic and atropa belladonna albeit the smallest of the ingredients seems should I even drink this? I'm not drinking it to cure a cold or flu, but maybe it's not even good for you and just stick to my other herbal tea blends? But I'd like to expand that blend and note each ingredient so maybe some of these are good to add? 

The ingredients, as you can see in the link are as follows:

\- ilex Pedunculosa whole AKA Longstalk Holly: *Yes, Ilex pedunculosa, also known as Longstalk Holly, is considered toxic to both humans and animals*

  
\-  Solanum Torvum root: *Yes, Solanum torvum, commonly known as Turkey Berry,¬†can be toxic, especially when ingested in large quantities or when immature*

  
\- Syzygium Cumini root AKA Java plum or black plum: *Non toxic to humans but pits are toxic to dogs.* 

  
\- Clerodendrum Infortunatum leaf AKA Hill Glory Bower: *While¬†Clerodendrum infortunatum¬†is traditionally used in various indigenous medicinal systems,¬†some studies suggest it can be toxic, particularly at higher doses*

*-* atropa belladonna AKA deadly nightshade: *Yes, Atropa belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade, is a highly poisonous plant.¬†All parts of the plant, including the leaves, roots, and fruits, contain toxic¬†tropane alkaloids¬†like¬†atropine,¬†hyoscyamine,¬†and¬†scopolamine.¬†Even small amounts can cause serious symptoms, and ingestion can be fatal.*¬†

This one is long one.

Two years ago I got invited to my friends( We will call her D) wedding.
 We knew each other's for a loooong time. About 10 years. She is not really my best friend but considered as a pretty good friend.
Her wedding was about 500km from my home. When I got the invitation I found out that i was pregnant. Ofcourse she was thrilled.
At the time of her wedding I was about 5 months pregnant. I was full of water and my legs were getting swollen really bad.
I traveled about 5-6h to her destination and got there about 22:00h
My friend( Her MOH), bride and me were in the same room to sleep because they rented the whole hotel for guests and us three were together in room so we can get first for makeup and friseur.
Makeup artist came about 03:00 AM. YES YOU READ THAT RIGT.
We went to sleep really late so I slept about 1.5h, maybe 2h
Friseur got in our room in about 05:00AM
I was so tired like really tired. 
When we were ready, bride asked me and her MOH to ger her wedding dress from other room and to help her get in the dress. We agreed.
I entered the room where dress was. DRESS WAS HUUUUUGE.
It was about 30kg. Big princess dress full of cirkones all over!
It was heavy as hell.
I was pregnant so I was a bit scared to lift something that heavy but I wanted to help.
Me and MOH somehow get the dress in our room and we started to get D in her dress. We had really hard time doing that but we eventually did it.
After that she wanted some coffee and some water and blablabla so I was going to get her all that thing down in the hotel lobby a couple of times from 4. FLOOR WITHOUT ELEVATOR.
My legs started to swell pretty bad but i was okay
Groom came and some od traditional things happend 
We went out to a church. it was summer, end of july
Outside was so damn warm, my makeup started to leave from my face, we were all so sweaty. it was horrible.
All day partying until about 23:00 pm
I couldn't stand anymore, my legs were huge and really hurtful. So I went to my room to sleep.
Day after we all went home, again 5-6h of travel on 35 celsius outside.
A month after, I finally found out gender of my baby. It was a girl. i was so happy and I texted D to tell her amazing news.
She didn't reply, even didn't see the message. Okay, weird because i know her phone is always in her hands.
Couple of days later, she posted some pictures from wedding and I texted her to send me pictures of two of us and other pictures where I am.
Again, she didn't reply or saw that message.
Two months passed and I kind ended up in our chat and saw that she didn't at all see my messages.
She didn't one asked me how I was during my pregnancy.
The day of labor came. I gave birth to a baby girl trough the emergency C-section, it wasn't planned but it had to go that way otherwise my baby or me wouldn't survive.

D texted me to congratulate on my baby and asked me: 'Is it okay if I come to hospital to see you?'

I said: 'No, you weren't there during my pregnancy, not a sigle text. I was helping my soul out for your wedding and didn't even get one damn Thank you?! I don't want you in my life. You showed your true colors.'

She didn't said anything, just seen.

Edit: In that couple of months when I send her messages and until my labor. She posted a hundreds of pictures, storyes. Even my friend told me they texted, but she didn't saw my messages.

So, AITA for telling her that?

Chapter 1: The Morning Silence

Detective Sarah Chen stepped out of her car and onto the beautiful surbuban street. The morning sun cast a golden glow over the scene, but the beauty was shattered by the yellow police tape surrounding the Wellington residence.

Sarah's eyes scanned the area, taking in the details. The house was a grand, two-story affair with a perfectly manicured lawn. But it was the kitchen window that drew her attention ‚Äì the one with the shattered glass and the faint smudge of blood on the sill.

As she approached the house, Sarah's partner, Detective Mike Hernandez, greeted her with a somber expression. ""Morning, Sarah. We've got a bad one here.""

Sarah nodded, her eyes locked on the kitchen door. ""What's the situation?""

Mike filled her in on the details. ""Marcus Wellington, 42, was found dead in his kitchen by his wife, Caroline. The 911 call came in at 6:05 am. The victim had a single stab wound to the chest.""

Sarah's eyes narrowed. ""Any signs of forced entry or struggle?""

Mike shook his head. ""None. The victim's wife said she didn't hear anything unusual during the night. The security cameras were disabled, but we're reviewing the footage from the neighbors' cameras.""

As they entered the kitchen, Sarah's gaze fell upon the body. Marcus Wellington lay on the floor, a kitchen knife protruding from his chest. The scene was eerily silent, except for the soft hum of the refrigerator.

Sarah's eyes scanned the room, taking in the details. A cup of coffee sat on the counter, next to a plate with a half-eaten breakfast. A newspaper lay open on the table, with a headline about a local business scandal.

As she processed the scene, Sarah's mind began to spin with questions. Who could have committed such a brutal crime? And what was the motive?

The detective's eyes locked onto a small piece of paper on the counter. It was a receipt from a local pharmacy, with a handwritten note on the back: ""Meet me at the usual place at midnight. ‚Äì J""

Done fighting against the agony she could no longer endure.

No longer a puppet with knotted-up strings.

Or a pretty bird trapped in a cage that sings.

A knife to her wrists with a tragedy at play.

She ignores her loved ones‚Äô pleas calling out to stay.



The tears that she drowns deep inside.

While trying to keep up with all her lies.

Of the painful stories her pale wrists tell.

Of how everything has made her life a living hell.

How boulders pressed down on her weary shoulders with the word obligation.

How she's been stuck in the trauma of another generation.



How her cunt is worth more than her soul.

Or how she plays the middle child role.

She talks too much, ‚ÄúLearn to be quiet.‚Äù

Now completely dead inside, ‚ÄúIt's too late to untie it.‚Äù

A smile that wishes to bare her teeth.

Hidden away by this thing called grief.



How bruises and cuts have become a canvas of art.

How she tried her best to shield her broken heart.

While life‚Äôs been a set of complicated races.

She‚Äôs struggling hard to remember her loved ones' faces.

Like the princess in the story Princess and the Pea.

She‚Äôs been drowning in sleepless nights like a pirate at sea.



‚ÄúThe pills are not working,‚Äù she‚Äôs said so before.

Covered in thick dust, her files were lost in the doctor‚Äôs drawer.

Her parents didn‚Äôt listen, no lessons they learned.

Won‚Äôt see reason, everyone‚Äôs concerned.

She had a rot that grew fungus deep into the marrow.

Not an important enough person to be buried like a pharaoh.



Tragedy is a road she‚Äôs crossed a few times.

Remembering cautiously that everyone has different sides.

A lesson she took seriously, her scars are her tells.

Hugging his cold pillow, she misses how he smells.

But the jealously and self-doubt had suffocated her brain.

So she cannot blame anyone for her fractured heart full of pain.



See, she‚Äôs danced this tune of melancholic since the day she took her first steps.

And now much older, her deeper thoughts she reflects.

How the pain doesn‚Äôt ease and just grows along with bones.

How all her choices left her at different crossroads.

Unable to go back and only forwards.

How happiness fled away and left no foreword‚Äôs.



How training wheels were taken off too early.

How his hands left her tiny body feeling dirty.

How roadmaps of lust were mapped over her body.

Leaving behind in her mouth a stale taste of his coffee.

The aftertaste memory of the bittersweet hot chocolate the police offer gave her.

How his steps left ghosts even years later.



The way her ADHD rewired her brain.

How everyone else thought she was insane.

Thinking only in complex puzzles.

Of how to fix all her life‚Äôs painful struggles.

When coloring out of the lines had always been more fun.

With her poetry, her suicide note, leaving everyone stunned.



It‚Äôs a pain in the heart that one can‚Äôt quite fix.

A run on sentence in poems that sticks.

One here is currently being written.

A run-on sentence, she is certain.

Something one will ignore with derision.

As they turn away with their own fake smile, as if they were on television.

A poem she writes she swears is almost over.

Fearfully exposing her soul in hopes of getting closure.



She wrote a story, but with a twist.

A true story of a girl that exists.

An autobiography secretly of her.

That she has written softly in verse.

The ending line finally being written.

She hopes you‚Äôve read and ought to listen.

Because nothing she did was ever right.

Despite putting up quite a hell of a fight.

For years, being told she's worthless with no love potential,

That she decided to write her final goodbyes with a very sharp pencil.

## Sennheiser Momentum 4‚Äã vs. the Competition: ‚Å§Choosing the‚Å¢ Right Headphones

When it ‚Äçcomes to premium noise-canceling ‚Äçheadphones, the sennheiser Momentum 4 faces stiff competition. let's‚Å§ see how it‚Äå stacks up against some of its main rivals:

### Sennheiser Momentum 4 ‚Äãvs Sony WH-1000XM5

The Sony WH-1000XM5 have ‚Äåconsistently been a‚Äå top contender in this category. ‚Å§Both headphones offer excellent noise cancellation and sound quality,‚Äç but there are key differences.

*   ‚Äã**Noise Cancellation:** both offer excellent ANC, but some reviews highlight ‚Å£the Momentum 4's adaptive ANC as ‚Äãbeing slightly more refined in certain situations.
*  ‚Äã‚Äç **Sound Quality:** The‚Å£ Momentum 4 often receives ‚Äãpraise for its more balanced and natural sound signature, while the XM5 can sometimes sound ‚Å¢a ‚Å§bit more processed.Preference here largely comes down to individual taste.
*   **Comfort:** Both‚Äã are comfortable, but‚Äå the Momentum 4's design is considered ‚Å¢by many to be more comfortable ‚Äåfor extended‚Äã wear.
*   **Features:** The XM5 offers a slightly wider range of‚Äå features, including Speak-to-Chat, which automatically pauses the music when it detects you're speaking.

Essentially, the decision between ‚Äåthe ‚Äçtwo often comes down to personal preference. If you‚Äã value a more natural sound and possibly superior comfort, the Momentum 4 may be the better choice. If you prefer a slightly more feature-rich‚Å¢ experience, the XM5 is a strong choice.

### Sennheiser Momentum 4 ‚Å¢vs Bose QuietComfort 45

The Bose‚Å£ QuietComfort 45 are known for thier‚Å§ exceptional comfort and reliable noise cancellation. However, when compared to the Sennheiser Momentum ‚Å£4, there are a few key distinctions:

* ‚Äç  **Noise‚Å§ Cancellation:** Bose has traditionally been the leader in noise ‚Äåcancellation, but ‚Äçlately, Sennheiser has ‚Å¢closed the gap. The Momentum ‚Äå4 offers competitive, and some would argue, superior noise cancellation, especially with its adaptive capabilities.
*   **Sound ‚Å¢Quality:** The Momentum 4 generally offers better sound quality than the ‚Å§QC45, with ‚Å£a wider soundstage and more‚Äå detailed audio.
*   **Features:** The Momentum 4 provides a richer set of features, including customizable‚Å§ EQ settings and multipoint pairing which are appreciated by users.

If comfort and established noise cancellation are your top priorities, the QC45 remain a ‚Å¢solid choice. Though, if you're looking for the best overall combination of‚Äå sound, noise cancellation, and features, the Momentum 4 is‚Äç a clear winner.

### Sennheiser Momentum 4 vs AirPods Max

The airpods‚Å§ Max are Apple's premium noise-canceling headphones, known for their luxurious‚Äç design and seamless integration with ‚Å¢Apple devices.They definitely fit into the premium headphones segment. The AirPods Max definitely‚Å¢ offer exceptional features, but users need to consider the associated price point. Here's how they compare to the Momentum 4:
* **Noise‚Äç Cancellation:** The noise cancellation is highly competitive between the two, both offering very effective blocking of outside‚Äã noise.
* ‚Å§**Sound Quality:** Both ‚Äçoffer exceptional sound quality. Ultimately, the ""better"" sound comes down to personal preference.
* **Ecosystem:** The AirPods Max are seamlessly integrated into the Apple ecosystem,‚Å¢ which is ‚Å¢a huge bonus for Apple users. though, if you are using Android ‚Å£the ‚Äåmomentum ‚Äå4 could ‚Äåbe better.

1jxbuq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jxbuq9/i_feel_lost/,I feel lost,"Hey community,

I am living through the shittiest last 48 hours of my life rn. I had a girlfriend whom I met at work back in August. We quickly became best friends because we connected on a lot of past traumas, mental health issues but also lifestyles, life outlook, core values and a thousand similar interests. I asked her out 2 months later & she said yes. I was the happiest guy in the world especially because last couple of years were really tough on me (long story short, lost my job due to bad politics at old company and had to move back to home country). After a couple of months of looking for a new job I ended up finding my current job where I met her.


I was and probably still am a little bit introverted and it takes time for me to open up to people once I trust them. She saw right through me and helped me regain my lost personality which was dead for a very long time. We spent so much time together at work going for walks, grabbing coffee or even random meals. Things started getting difficult in Jan this year when she had to deal with her Dad‚Äôs health who had been battling a heart condition. I was supportive of her & tried to provide as much strength and positive enforcement as I could. Throughout this time she never did take me for granted and even went out of her way to spend time with me even when her family needed her. I loved her with all my heart and soul and she did reciprocate with even more as I hoped that soon her father would recover and I could ask her hand in marriage. 

She always knew my intentions were to get together for a lifetime and she couldn‚Äôt wait to get married too. I know we were rushing to get married after only knowing each other for a couple of months, but we both confessed our true intentions numerous times of staying together forever knowing that we really uplift each other in tough times and also our shared values were basis of a very strong foundation.

Things took a turn on Thursday when she had to rush to the hospital because her Dad was in a very critical state. Friday early morning she texted me that everything in her life is over including her family. I couldn‚Äôt talk to her because I missed her texts at 2am Friday. But later in the day I talked to her on text briefly and she told me that her Dad has passed away and she is leaving everything to join the defence force her Dad was a part of. She said she‚Äôs destroying her identity and leaving the country so I will never get to see her again. I knew that she always wanted to serve her country but doing so unexpectedly and throwing her life away has devastated me especially when we were so good together and there was never a doubt or hint of her deciding to take this extreme step.

Its been 48 hours since I last talked to her on text and I have been crying nonstop. I feel like I lost a part of myself and I still have no closure. I‚Äôve been texting her since then begging her to call me and maybe meet me 1 last time but I still haven‚Äôt heard from her yet. I feel lost, I feel sick and emotionally exhausted. I gave her the most comfort I could in her tough time and she did too the same when I was struggling with my mental health. But losing her over a span of couple of hours is really hard.

Also last I texted her, she said her phone & movements are being monitored by the defence force so she will talk to me soon but at this point I don‚Äôt know what to do with my overwhelming emotions anymore.

This guide is for anyone who's trying to get a handle on their money, especially if you've started budgeting but feel like it‚Äôs not quite working.

**What this covers:**  
These are five super common mistakes people (including me) make when setting up a budget. I‚Äôll break them down, explain what usually goes wrong, and share how I fixed (or still struggle with) each one.

**Quick heads-up:**  
Budgeting isn't about perfection. It‚Äôs about awareness and adjusting along the way. If you‚Äôve messed up, welcome to the club‚Äîwe‚Äôve all been there.

# 1. Forgetting About Irregular Expenses

**What it looks like:**  
You plan for rent, groceries, gas, etc. But then your car insurance renews or your cousin‚Äôs wedding pops up, and suddenly you‚Äôre dipping into your savings or your credit card.

**How it burned me:**  
My first few months of budgeting went great‚Ä¶ until my yearly Amazon Prime and six-month insurance payment both hit in the same week. Boom‚Äîbudget wrecked.

**Fix I recommend:**  
List out all the non-monthly stuff (like gifts, travel, annual subscriptions). Then divide the cost by 12 and treat it like a monthly expense. Put that amount into a sinking fund (just a separate savings pot). When the bill hits, the money‚Äôs already there.

# 2. Skipping an Emergency Fund

**What it looks like:**  
You‚Äôre living paycheck to paycheck, and any unexpected cost (flat tire, sick pet, job loss) completely derails everything.

**How it hit me:**  
I lost a freelance gig during COVID, and I had *nothing* saved. Rent still needed paying, food still needed buying. Not fun.

**What I do now:**  
Even if you‚Äôre broke, start small. I put aside $10 a month at first. Now I aim for 3‚Äì6 months of essential expenses. It grows slowly, but it grows. And it gives serious peace of mind.

# 3. Cutting Out All the Fun

**What it looks like:**  
You budget for bills, savings, and groceries... and that‚Äôs it. No room for coffee, movies, or hobbies. You're a budgeting monk. Until you're not.

**Been there:**  
I once decided to ‚Äúget serious‚Äù and cut out everything ‚Äúnon-essential.‚Äù A month later, I rage-bought new headphones and ordered takeout five days in a row. Oops.

**What works better:**  
Build in a little fun money. Even $30 a month can keep you sane. The key is **intentional** spending. You don‚Äôt have to feel guilty if it‚Äôs in the plan.

# 4. Underestimating Your Bills

**What it looks like:**  
You lowball your electricity bill because ‚Äúthis month I‚Äôll really cut down.‚Äù You don‚Äôt. The bill's higher than you guessed. You‚Äôre short. Again.

**My goof:**  
Every winter, I‚Äôd assume I could survive on one blanket and no heater. The truth? I need heat, man. And electricity in India ain't cheap during those months.

**Better approach:**  
Look at your past 3‚Äì6 months of bills. Take the average or round up a bit. It‚Äôs better to overestimate and have extra cash than scramble when bills overshoot.

# 5. Not Tracking Expenses

**What it looks like:**  
You make a budget once, feel great, and then never look at it again. Weeks later, you‚Äôre wondering where all your money went.

**How I learned this:**  
I created this gorgeous spreadsheet. Fonts, colors, categories‚Äîit was art. But I didn‚Äôt track my spending. So it was basically useless.

**What I do now:**  
I use a simple app (or sometimes just Google Sheets). Every few days, I log what I spend. It takes 5 minutes. Helps me stay on track and tweak things if I go over.

# Final Thoughts

Budgeting sounds boring, I know. But honestly, once you get the hang of it, it gives you so much freedom. You don‚Äôt have to wonder if you can afford something‚Äîyou‚Äôll already know.

If you're just starting, remember this: **Start messy, stay curious, adjust often.** Don‚Äôt stress about being perfect. Just aim to be a little more aware each month.",1,1744442655.0,ValueForLess,0,1.0,False

I don't know if I'll feel different when my baby is actually here but I dont see myself getting bothered if someone wants to hold my baby.

All I see online is people talking about how they don't want anyone to hold the baby and if they have visitors that they have to do chores around the house rather than hold the baby. I even went to a perinatal health course and the subject was brought up there.

To be honest, I would love if someone came over and held my baby so I could fix a coffee, snack or just clean up a little. I dont get what the issue is? Do people hang around people they dont trust/love? Dont they want to see their loved ones appreciate and love their son/daughters? Of course I wouldn't just let ANYONE hold my baby, they would have to be a known, trusted person. A close friend, grandparent, sibling etc sure, I have no issues letting them hold the baby providing either myself or my husband is present. 

I just feel like so much content online is fear mongering and adds unnecessary anxiety/stress. The new age way of parenting feels very closed off and anxiety producing. Basically lock yourself in a box or else. That's not good for our mental health imo.

My name is Gareth, I'm 43 years old, and I own a Nespresso machine.

So, I really want a Gaggia Classic, but it's just not going to happen in the immediate future.

My wife had a Nespresso machine when we met 11 years ago (I should have gotten out while I still could, right?), and it's just kind of osmosed into my life. I have a few other ways of making coffee that I generally use on weekends. I've got a French press, V60, moka pot, and an Aeropress. I love messing around with techniques and recipes. But I'm sorry to admit it: during the week, I'm smashing those pods.

There are a few reasons why I can't get a GC. Firstly, space. We have a small coffee area in our kitchen, and there is no room for another machine.  There is categorically no way the Nespresso is going anywhere (on my wife's instructions). Secondly, money. I've had some health issues in the last few years, and unfortunately, my career had to take a bit of a sideline. I don't earn what I used to and frankly don't have the spare cash for fun projects like customizing a coffee machine.

I know there are other subreddits more generally about espresso and coffee machines, but I genuinely value the opinions of people in this subreddit. If it were possible, I'd have a GC hands down.

Can anyone offer advice on a system I can buy that requires no upgrades or customization to make espresso?  I can spend up to ¬£250, which needs to cover both machine and grinder.

I know I could get a basic machine and then upgrade the springs and add a bottomless portafilter, etc., but that's not feasible; ¬£250 is already a tough sell, and announcing a ¬£300 grinder purchase in six months won't work.

Simply put: If you had ¬£250 to spend on making espresso, what would you choose?

Thanks for your understanding.

In my first year (now I am third) I tried to talk with as many people as possible and I thought, I made some friends. Those bonds just broke in time and we slowly lose contact. It's like a vicious cycle: I met someone we talk a lot, hang out at a coffee shop (or whatever other place), deep talk (one girl actually told me :""oh we get along so well, we will be best friends"" haha nope) the time passes and contact dwindles . And I try to interact with them be it with reel or just messages to keep in touch. Then they turn down any other option to hang out somewhere. This happened with most of the people I met.

Now, here it comes the tricky part. I met some people that stayed(kinda): let's call them X(F), Y(F)and Z(M).

I could say X is my best friend out of all. Last year, we really hanged out a lot and I felt like I could finally have a friend by my side. I also was her moral support cuz a really bad breakup she had during that time. Well, in January, I had a rough period myself and she didn't really offer me much of a support. Worse, I just felt used and belitteled. (Even if that might have not been her intention) I talked with her about this and now she is trying to focus on me more. I guess we just didn't have a balanced friendship and I was more like a consolation to her. Although,  she tryes to help me and sparkle my interest again, I still lost a bit of trust in her. And I don't think she really understands me anymore, nor has the time to, cuz she is busy with other stuff. (I do understand this, but in my position, I cannot keep my enthusiasm when it is not reciprocated)

Y is a colleague of X. We are good friends tho she is too busy for me to get close to her. And all of her outside uni activities are not aligned at all with mine.(she is really religous, me not so much) So, we just talk when we see each other at uni. This is how my interactions goes with other colleagues as well. And my invites to do things outside uni gets turned off.

The story with Z is complicated. He has a big friend group.( some of them, I know and I really like them). He is really extroverted and makes friends constantly and is always busy with stuff. Well, we knew each other from the beginning of the year cuz we met a couple of time( talked a bit, but nothing else). Last year, we went together on a university trip. We got closer( we hanged out and has some deep talks), but I found out he really likes me.(I have a happy and stable relationship of 3 years). He didn't say that straight to me but it was obvious and his best friend told me that. My fault at that time was that I didn't address it straight on.

 When we came back, his friend group really tried to hang out with me and get to know me. Well, I was really anxious around them, cuz sometimes they were making weird remarks about me and Z like we were together, even tho all of them knew about my relationship with my bf. So, I became more and more anxious about Z. And this whole friend group kinda started to see that, so they didn't invite me to hang around with them and turned off all of my offers of stuff to do. Maybe, they thought I didn't like them or that I am weird. The thing is I didn't get to talk to Z about everything that happened and cool down and not be nervous. And show his friend group who I really am and not stay in a corner and blend in. It's like I got only one chance at having a really nice friend group and I fucked it up. 

What am I to do now? I've got no friends to hang around and I don't know where to find them anymore. (I only get out of the house with my childhood friend every 2 weeks, cuz she is busy and has other friends as well) The rest of the time I stay with my bf or alone.

I also think there must be something wrong with me cuz if I don't do anything nobody talk with me. It's like I am a ghost. This is a trap I want to avoid falling into, but I really can't when people are turning their back on me.(except my bf and childhood friend)

And Idk I always make time for people that I care about and I am busy as much as them. So, even tho sometimes I understand this, there should be a limit and some people have passed it for me.

I spent these 21 years trying to help and understand people. I love to talk with them and hang out with them, but lately I realised the time invested in these friendships was for nothing. I am getting sick of caring. ",1,1744440814.0,friendship,0,1.0,False

I loved my boss, but he was about to get engaged.
He smiled‚Äîthat same warm but distant smile. ""I'm getting married soon. Can you help me out?""
I added one word to that smile: cruel. I organized his engagement party, telling myself it was the only way to truly let go.
But that night, he drunkenly knocked on the door of my house.
The moment the door opened, he collapsed into my arms. He pushed me back until we tumbled onto the couch.
""No‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre engaged!"" I grabbed his hands just as they reached the buttons of my blouse.
He gasped, his breath hot against my skin.
Then he tilted my chin up and kissed me like crazy.

Chapter 1
At thirty, I decided to resign and put an end to my secret crush that no one ever knew about.
It took me five years to work my way up from assistant to Markus Serrano's chief secretary and another three to make myself indispensable to him.
And yet, it only took five minutes to write my resignation letter and barely a second to send.
When I handed it to Markus, he frowned slightly, his eyes lingering on my face. ""Give me a reason.""
I avoided his gaze and forced what I hoped was a sincere smile. ""Mr. Serrano, I'm thirty. It's about time I got married""
After a pause, I added, ""My boyfriend proposed recently.""
It was a harmless little lie‚Äîjust something to make leaving easier.
Markus tapped his fingers against the desk, one beat after another, a sure sign he was annoyed.
Maybe I should've felt relieved. At least he wasn't completely indifferent to my leaving.
After a long silence, he slid the letter back toward me. ""I can approve a marriage leave instead. I hope you'll reconsider.""
For a moment, I hesitated. A voice in my head kept whispering, ""Just say yes. At least you'll still get to see him.""
But another voice snapped in my head, ""Raquel, he's engaged. It's wrong to keep chasing someone who belongs to someone else.""
My hand hovered over the letter for a long moment, then pulled back. ""This job is too demanding. After marriage, I want to focus more on family.
""I'll finish all the handovers properly. I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Serrano.""
There wasn't much left for Markus to argue with. ""Understood. Congratulations, by the way,"" he said flatly.
As I walked out, he was already back to his work.
To him, I was just another employee. Maybe I stood out for being capable, but still replaceable.
Back at my desk, I sat staring at the potted plant on it, zoning out for once.
Moments like this didn't come often. My days were always packed, managing tasks and doubling as Markus's personal assistant.
My phone was always on standby. The second he needed me, I had to show up, one person doing the work of three.
Of course, Markus paid me well. 
I didn't even notice Eva Lawson calling my name until she'd said it several times.
""Hey, Raquel. Mr. Serrano asked me to remind you, that you're in charge of prepping for tonight's party.""
It was a welcome party for Chuck Schroeder, back from studying abroad. It was a small, exclusive gathering‚ÄîMarkus's inner circle.
Young elites from powerful families. Wealthy, picky, and not easy to impress.
Strictly speaking, outsiders weren't welcome in their circle. But I was the exception.
Someone who could manage every detail, cater to every preference, and keep the evening running without a hitch? That was rare.
When I arrived at the venue, I dove straight into preparations.
Food, drinks, desserts, I double-checked everything. Every guest's likes and dislikes were noted and addressed.
I was giving out instructions as I went. ""Remove all the lilies. Mr. Serrano doesn't like them.
""Dim the lights a little. Mr. Campbell just had eye surgery.
""And don't forget the gin and tonic. Mr. Schroeder loves it.""
As the sun dipped below the horizon and the sky darkened, guests began to trickle in.
Ivan Campbell was the first to show up. ""Hey, do you know when Markus is getting here?""
I checked my watch and answered carefully, ""He's still in a meeting. Should be about an hour.""
He collapsed onto the couch, looking beat. The dark circles under his eyes said it all.
I had someone lower the volume on the music and then handed him a blanket. ""Autumn nights get chilly. They won't be here for a while. You can have a rest.""
He chuckled, taking the blanket. ""You really don't want to jump ship and work for me instead? I'll double your salary.""
People like Ivan were always surrounded by those trying to get something from him, which made me stand out.
Because I never asked for anything, I could speak with them openly and honestly. And in turn, earned a bit of their respect.
I smiled and replied, ""I'll keep that in mind. If I ever end up with nowhere to go, I hope you'll take me in, Mr. Campbell.""

Chapter 2
As night deepened, the streetlights flickered on. Guests arrived one after another.
Markus walked in wearing a black coat, carrying a trace of autumn's somber chill.
I took his coat, thinking it might be the last time.
Once they were tipsy and in good spirits, I stood up and raised my glass.
""Guys, I'll be leaving my job soon. When I started, I had no idea what I was doing and messed up a lot. Thanks for putting up with me and being so kind.
""Hope we'll cross paths again someday.""
The chill of autumn hung in the air, adding a quiet weight to the moment. A silence fell over the table.
Ivan broke it, raising his glass. ""You know, for the longest time, I thought you had a thing for Markus. Guess I was wrong.""
The others picked up on the hint in Ivan's words. Markus's secretaries were all dismissed after confessing their feelings for him.
Switching to hiring men didn't help‚Äîthey fell for Markus too. That was how he got the nickname ""Heartbreaker.""
A friend gave Markus a light pat on the shoulder and teased, ""Who would have thought? Looks like not everyone's heart is yours to break.""
Markus lit a cig, barely looking up. ""Give it a rest,"" he said with a smile.
After dinner, they played poker to pass the time.
Halfway through, Ivan asked casually, ""Hey, Markus, have you met Ms. Velez, the girl your grandma picked for you?""
My heart skipped a beat, and I froze, the water pitcher still in my hand.
Markus replied after a moment, uninterested. ""Not yet. If Grandma is happy, I'll marry whoever she wants.""
For Markus and his friends, marriage was never about love. It was a calculated decision, shaped by interests and trade-offs.
With their wealth and resources, seeing marriage as a contract made sense.
Markus seemed to have accepted that.
I had met Judith Velez once‚Äîgraceful and pleasant.
Still, deep down, I hoped Markus could be different from his friends.
The party ended around midnight, and chauffeurs already waited outside to take everyone home.
But Markus's driver was delayed by an accident.
It left me alone with Markus, the moment I dreaded most. Under the streetlight, our shadows stretched long across the pavement.
Frustration stirred, and I was struggling with those darker thoughts.
Markus stood quietly, oblivious. I noticed his sharpness softened by the spirit.""
Before long, his driver arrived.
Markus turned to me and asked kindly, ""Need a ride?""
I shook my head and gave a polite smile. ""Thanks, but my fianc√© is already on his way.""
He gave a slight nod and got into the car.
Suddenly, I was alone. The act dropped.
I kicked off my heels and sank onto the edge of the flowerbed, feeling lost.
For a moment, I wasn't even sure where to go.
Then the rain came. It was the first autumn drizzle, and a chill settled in.
Barefoot, I walked down the road. In this fancy place, it took ages before I finally found a spot to catch a cab.

---
The usual route was under construction, and Markus's driver had to double back to take another road.
Markus hadn't expected to see Raquel Perkins again‚Äîstanding in the rain, her heels dangling from her hand.
He was more surprised to see this side of her.
At work, Raquel was always perfectly put together, her suits crisp and her shirts neatly buttoned to the top.
He had seen plenty of women unbutton their shirts and lean forward to show their curves, but Raquel was different.
That was what he appreciated about her‚Äînot just her professionalism, but her respect for boundaries.
As the car neared, the driver asked, ""Should we offer Ms. Perkins a ride?""
Markus said coolly, ""No need.""
Markus didn't think much of her fianc√© because she left her job for him. ""Raquel is sharp but lacks judgment when it comes to men,"" he thought.
Still, it felt too personal for him to offer his opinion.

Chapter 3
I couldn't be sure if it was Markus's car. It passed too quickly.
In this neighborhood, someone like me hailing a taxi was rare.
The cab came from far away, and by the time it arrived, I couldn't feel my legs.
When I finally got home, it was around three in the morning. The house was silent.
To the outside world, I looked like a woman with a perfect life‚Äîa happy family, a loving fianc√©, and plenty of friends.
Others envied me, saying, ""You've got the perfect life.""
But that was just not true. I had no family, no love, no friends.
When I was in middle school, my mother was diagnosed with late-stage cancer.
She had surgery, but it came back just six months later.
One morning, my father left for work and never showed up again.
He took all the money, leaving my sick mother and me, still just a kid, to fend for ourselves.
When she heard the news, she stayed unnervingly calm. She endured the treatments and hospital stays quietly, and on her good days, she cooked for me.
One evening, I came home from school to a table full of dishes. She sat across from me, smiling warmly.
Something felt off. The food smelled strange when I leaned in closer.
Then I remembered the bottle of poison she had bought recently. When she held me down, I realized for the first time just how strong her grip was.
I got desperate, and the moment she let her guard down, I struggled out. I ran without looking back, somehow ending up on the rooftop.
She followed me and spread her arms for a hug. ""Sweetheart, the world is too cruel. I can't leave you here alone.
""Come with me. In the next life, we'll still be family""
I broke into tears, too exhausted to keep fighting. And I longed for the comforting scent of laundry detergent on her clothes.
Then I thought maybe a life like this wasn't worth living at all.
The wind on the rooftop was strong that night. My mother's embrace felt so warm. She held my hand and led me toward the edge.
Just as we were about to fall, a guy grabbed me.
His hands were thin but steady, holding tight despite my struggles.
His bright eyes were all I could see.
I survived, but my mother didn't.
That guy was Markus. He didn't just save my life; he gave me a reason to keep going‚Äîto repay him.
I always felt like I had betrayed my mother. Back then, I was like someone drowning, desperate to cling to anything that could keep me afloat.
Markus became that lifeline.
Later, the fire trucks, ambulances, and police came. Amid the chaos, I held onto his hand, looking up at him. ""How do I pay you back?"" I asked.
I could still picture the 16-year-old Markus looking down at me, serious as ever. ""Just come find me,"" he said.
It felt like I had been stuck in that night ever since. I pulled myself together just for Markus.
Once again, I dreamed of those dark moments‚Äîmy mother asking why I had betrayed her, my father's silent face as he left us.
I woke up soaked in sweat, my throat raw. I was running a fever.
The thermometer read 38.8 degrees.
Usually, I would take meds and head to work like nothing was wrong.
But this time, I called in sick. I needed space to figure out where my life was heading.

---
Markus went to work as usual. When he realized Raquel wasn't there, he asked around and learned she had called in sick.
He frowned and started to hate her fianc√©.
Eva, her assistant, stepped in to cover her tasks. She brought Markus a coffee.
He took a slow sip.
It was sweeter than usual, with an extra sugar cube. Without a word or any hint of emotion, he set the coffee aside and didn't touch it again.
Eva made another mistake with this morning's meeting documents. Luckily, Markus knew the key points of the negotiation well enough to keep things on track.
The office felt colder than usual, and the humidifier was off, leaving his throat dry.
Nothing was obviously wrong, but it just didn't feel right.
For the first time, Markus found himself thinking about Raquel. He realized she rarely crossed his mind.
She had a way of making everything fall into place so seamlessly that her presence was only felt in its absence.
Markus frowned again at the thought of Raquel's fianc√©.
He took away Markus's most trusted assistant.

---
I spent the day lying in bed, lost in thought. But I still hadn't figured out where my life was headed.
I felt like a ship adrift in a vast ocean.
The next morning, I got up and went to work.
Eva greeted me with a strange, cautious look. Then she whispered, ""Mr. Serrano didn't seem happy yesterday. He only took one sip of his coffee.""
The coffee was still on his desk. I dipped a finger into it, tasted it, and said, ""Too sweet. Three cubes, no more, no less.""
I carefully showed Eva how to prepare the coffee.
By the time it was ready, Markus had arrived.
He seemed in a better mood than usual, judging by his faint smile. But his eyes told a different story, leaving me unsure.

###Chapter 4
Handing over my work was way more of a hassle than I thought. I had so many jobs to pass on, and it wasn't like I could dump them all at once.
I had to spell out every little thing for him.
So, I grabbed a notebook and started jotting down everything that came to mind, from tiny details to big stuff.
This little detour meant that the handover, which was supposed to take a month, got pushed back. And that landed me right in the middle of the last thing I wanted to do: pick up Judith from the airport and take her to the Serrano's house.
There were rumors that I had some wrong ideas about Markus. Even though I didn't do anything, I felt a bit guilty seeing him.
Judith was wearing a bluish-white dress, with an emerald pendant that cost a fortune around her neck. Her hair was done up with a hairpin. She had a kind of elegance that made her stand out in a crowd.
I put on a smile and walked up to her. ""Ms. Velez, Mr. Serrano sent me to pick you up.""
On the way, Judith asked me some questions about Markus. It was natural to feel nervous when she was about to marry someone she had only met a few times.
I could tell she was anxious, so I softened my voice and said, ""Mr. Serrano is a good guy. Ms. Velez, please don't worry. You can come to me if you have any concerns.""
Hearing this, she looked up at me gratefully.
We kept talking all the way to the Serrano's house. I planned to drop Judith off and leave, but Markus' grandpa, Donovan Serrano, stopped me.
He was known for his ruthless business tactics back in the day. Now in his seventies, he was still sharp as a tack, especially with those piercing eyes.
""Raquel, where's Markus?"" he asked.
Markus wasn't home?
I kept my face calm and answered carefully, ""There's a lot going on at the company today. Mr. Serrano might be late.""
Donovan gave a cold hum and, being nice for once, told me to bring Markus back.
I had seen Donovan punish Markus before‚Äîsix lashes, leaving his back all scarred. He still had the marks.
Once I was out the door, I called Markus. Thank goodness, on the third try, he finally answered.
I asked him where he was, but he didn't answer. After a while, he said my name, ""Raquel.""
His voice sounded fuzzy, like he had been drinking, and there was a loud sound of sea wind in the background.
I had a hunch where he might be. When I got there in a hurry, I saw him sitting by the rocks on the coast, with a few cans of cheap liquor from the supermarket next to him.
His hair was messy from the night wind.
Markus glanced up at me when he heard me coming. His eyes looked kind of out of it, but still sharp, like he was drunk, but not really.
""Here you are. Hang on, I'll be done in a second.""
Markus patted the spot next to him. ""Come sit. Let's chat.""
The Serrano's house was quite close to the sea cliff. At night, it was all lit up, yet its classical design gave it an ancient charm.
Markus suddenly asked, ""Is it pretty?""
I was staring at his nice jawline and blurted out, ""Yes.""
My face turned bright red, but he didn't seem to notice. He continued, ""But actually, it's a tomb. No matter how beautiful it looks, only dead bones are buried inside.""
He said it with a smile, but he sounded totally serious.
People said the Serrano family didn't play fair when they got rich. There were some shady things going on. But they had been trying to clean things up these past few years.
I had been working for Markus for seven years, watching him slowly take over the Serrano Group.
There were so many tough fights and hidden traps. It was not something I'd tell anyone.
So did he ever get tired? I wondered that and asked, ""Are you happy?""
The answer kind of stuck in his mouth. He smiled but didn't respond.
Instead, he looked at me and said, ""Your fianc√© isn't good enough.""
I was taken aback, but he didn't say more. He nodded and apologized, ""Sorry, I crossed a line.""
After finishing the last sip of his drink, he stood up. In an instant, he was back to being the refined CEO of the Serrano Group.

Chapter 5
On my way home, I kept thinking about what Markus meant by his words.
I thought about it for a long time but couldn't figure it out, just like I never understood why he showed up alone on that old building's rooftop over a decade ago.
But none of it mattered to me anymore because I was quitting.
We'd probably never see each other again.
The day I quit was rainy. The rain in the south was always light and heavy, pattering down like it'd never stop.
I sat at my desk, silently packing up my stuff.
I had been in this spot for almost ten years, growing from a clueless girl in my early twenties to someone who could handle things on my own now.
I knew that every morning at nine, the sunlight would hit the cactus I had.
I also knew that if I tiptoed quietly, I could catch a glimpse of Markus through the gap.
I had been holding on to these little things to get by in this world, but now I was leaving.
I had repaid my debt of gratitude for eight years. It was time for Judith to be with Markus for the rest of his life.
Eva's eyes were watery as she looked at me. I wiped her tears and smiled, ""Come on, it's not like we'll never see each other again.""
But deep down, I knew we probably wouldn't.
This city had too many painful memories for me. It was time to leave.
When I turned to go, I felt a bit of regret. I had dragged things out for so long, but I never got to see Markus one last time.
After I quit, I slept a lot at home, like I was making up for all the sleep I missed over the years.
I even bought some booze and cranked the TV all the way up.
There was a comedy on, and I laughed my head off, like a complete fool.
But after the laughter died down, I sat there on the floor, staring at the dark room, feeling kind of lost and not knowing what to do next.
When I was little, all I wanted was to do well in school. I thought if I got good grades, my parents wouldn't fight.
Then my dad left, and my wish was to make a lot of money so my mom could live on.
After my mom passed away, I wanted to be Markus' right-hand woman. If he was happy, I figured I'd be happy too.
But now, I didn't even know what I wanted anymore.
I was zoning out when the doorbell rang. I looked through the peephole and saw Markus.
I opened the door in a rush and then realized I was still in my pink bunny pajamas.
It was too late to close the door, so I had to bear, invite Markus in, and try to look somewhat professional.
Markus was way calmer than me. He said, ""I called you.
""The document for today is urgent. I couldn't find the backup, and I happened to be driving nearby.""
I blushed for a second, but then I put on my professional smile again. ""Okay. Please ",1,1744440699.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

When I was feeling like that I literally couldn't stay out of things to say. And they were all hitting the target (which ever this could be). 

Nowadays this is not my normal state.I drink coffee and almost nothing happens. Before you say ""tolerance"" in caffeine, i experimented by having the patience and will power to not consume coffee for a week. Nothing changed.

I feel like a different person. I don't think it's normal because there are times that I find the self that I love, but it's more rare, and it's day and night difference.

I used to be so ambitious, so ready to handle a job, a task or whatever because I had so much energy and I liked that.

I workout, eat healthy, take cold shower/exposure(sometimes). I think that i do many good things for my brain but still looking for the answer to why I can become from the soul of party to the person that can barely speak.

He does a sport I always wanted to try so we met up recently and he's been teaching me which has been a great distraction from a messy breakup. I started to get into it and it's become almost a weekly thing. It's the highlight of my week to see him and practice together.

He's single too and we bonded over what went wrong in both of our previous relationships. We definitely have some flirty jokes when we meet up, but he's awful at texting back and when I suggested once or twice going for food or coffee after sport he said no (although we often used to do lunches). When I confided in him about my fears breaking up with my ex, he said ah, you won't be single for long, you're awesome etc. He often remembers little details I tell him and asks about them later on.

I'm super confused by the mixed signals and would love if he asked me out on a date but I guess maybe the huge age gap is holding him back (I do wish it wasnt so big but that's life).

I'm in the process of unpacking and setting up my rental and would LOVE your advice on layout.

**The room (pics 1-3)**  
As you can see, there is a large-ish unstructured living area. I would love to have one part as a dining area and one part as a lounge area.

**Furniture I have (pics 4-8):**  
I have the following furniture that I will need to place somewhere:

* Dining table with 4 chairs
* LARGE egg chair with hanging frame
* Beanbag
* Kivik couch
* Would like to buy a lift-top coffee table
* Large cat tree

**Note (pics 9-11):** I'm open to putting maybe the beanbag or egg chair in my bedroom if needed. Feel free to make any suggestions about my bedroom layout to accommodate this.

**Floor plan (pic 10):** I've included a roughly-to-scale floor plan including furniture of roughly the right dimensions. The large brown pillow is because there was no beanbag option  I will also show some of my failed attempts to rearrange the furniture myself so you can see some of the difficulties I've had.

**Other considerations:**

* My cat prefers the cat tree to be where she can see out the back door
* I would love the egg chair to be part of a cosy reading area, so some sort of table or shelf nearby would be great.
* Ideally I'd prefer if the beanbag & egg chair could fit in the living room somehow
* It might be nice to have some shelves of some sort somewhere in the room for when I get home and want to put my belongings somewhere (plus the wifi modem needs somewhere to live).

I'm limited in funds but if there's anything you think I should purchase to bring the room together, feel free to post links. I live in a small city in Australia and have a small car though, so please keep this in mind when suggesting where to buy from.

Thank you SO much in advance for any suggestions. It is very, very appreciated.

On the date, he seemed big headed and too about himself but seemed nice enough. At the end he said he would like to walk me back to my apartment.
Thinking he was being polite I now my said sure. When we got there I got my key stuck in the door. He got it out then let himself in. Not my plan but I knew I couldn't just easily remove a 6'4"" and over 200lbs man and thought it would be fine. Then he pinned me against the wall stuck his tongue out and started to move towards my mouth. I was stunned and couldn't speak. I tried to push him off and he didn't move an inch till I started screaming. Then I told him I wasn't comfortable and I didn't want to kiss or hook up. I haven't even had my first kiss yet and wanted to find someone who I truly love. He said ok. A few minutes later he picked up my bible and started asking questions about my beliefs and said he was a Christian too. Then he old me I was little innocent and sweet. Alarm bells were going off but l was frozen. Then he proceeded to stick his hands up my pants. At first in shock, l did nothing and after a bit shoved his hand away. He then he thought I was ok with him doing that. After this he through a sort of fit and said I was the only girl to ever turn him down. I felt guilty and blamed myself. He then left and force me to hug him on the way out (pull me tighter and saying I was not hugging hard enough).

I‚Äôm writing this from an old dusty computer. I don‚Äôt even know if this will work, but since I‚Äôm down here for the rest of my life, I might as well make use of my free time.

There‚Äôs no signal. No WiFi. No internet browser I can find. Just a black terminal window with a blinking green cursor, and somehow‚Ä¶ Reddit is the only site I can access. Don‚Äôt ask me how. If I had to guess, it‚Äôs part of the design.

This place is called the Witness Room. That‚Äôs not official. It‚Äôs just what I started calling it after I figured out what it does. If you‚Äôve read this far, and this actually posts, then I guess the room wants you to see this.

I didn‚Äôt fall into a portal. I didn‚Äôt get abducted by aliens. I wasn‚Äôt sleepwalking or drugged or anything else that makes this easier to explain. I was just at home. Sitting on the floor, staring at the wall, thinking about how I hadn‚Äôt done anything useful with my life.

And then I blinked‚Äîand I was here.


There was one door (don‚Äôt‚Äô ask I‚Äôve already tried everything to open it), no windows, no bed, no toilet. Just concrete walls, stale air, a massive black screen embedded in the wall in front of a single plastic chair, and a metal desk with a computer infront of it. No lights I could see, but the room was dimly lit anyway. It‚Äôs always the same level of light, no matter how long I wait. No shadows. Just a dull, gray atmosphere like the inside of a mausoleum.

The screen turned on by itself.

And it showed me.

Not just me standing there, but me before‚Äîfrom moments in my life. A camera angle over my shoulder at my tenth birthday party. A shot from my college dorm window, zoomed in through the blinds. One clip was from inside my own living room, showing me watching TV last week. I never noticed the camera. Because there wasn‚Äôt one.

And then the screen started showing people.

People watching me. Not metaphorically. Literally.

In every clip, there‚Äôs someone watching. Sometimes it‚Äôs obvious. A man staring at me from a coffee shop booth across the street. A woman in an elevator, pretending to scroll through her phone. Other times, it‚Äôs subtle‚Äîjust a figure in the background of a reflection. A shadow under the bed that doesn‚Äôt belong to anyone.

At first, I thought I had absolutely lost my mind or fell asleep and ended up in a nightmare. But I have been here a long time- I don‚Äôt know how long but definitely years. 

The screen showed me things that could not have been coincidences. A moment when I was nine, playing in my backyard, and someone was standing behind our shed. Just‚Ä¶ staring.

A moment when I was dirty from soccer practice and taking a shower. 

A moment when I was graduating high school.

The moment I got divorced.

The moment I lost my child. 

It never stopped. It just kept going. Showing me more clips. Years and years of moments when I was being watched and never knew it.

And now‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm the one watching.

Don‚Äôt ask how I eat, sleep, or use the bathroom. 

Well the quick answer is I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt need to.

Maybe I died and this is some kind of hell or maybe I died and I‚Äôm some type of guardian angel. Either way doesn‚Äôt matter.

From what I‚Äôve come to understand, this room operates on some kind of cycle. The ones who were watched become the watchers. It doesn‚Äôt ask for consent, or offer a way out. You don‚Äôt get a warning. One day, you‚Äôre the subject. The next, you‚Äôre the observer.

I haven‚Äôt found any purpose to it. It‚Äôs not like I can intervene. I can‚Äôt stop accidents. I can‚Äôt whisper good luck into someone‚Äôs ear. I just sit here. Watching. Always watching. That‚Äôs the only function I‚Äôve discovered so far.

It took forever for the screen to stop showing me my life. Clip after clip of moments I forgot about or wished I‚Äôd never remembered. And then‚Äîfinally‚Äîit switched.

I guess I‚Äôve been assigned to someone now.

It‚Äôs a baby. A girl. Maybe a few months old. I don‚Äôt know how or why, but she‚Äôs the one I see now. Her crib, her parents feeding her, blurry snippets of their home. I know this sounds messed up, but as a man, I don‚Äôt feel right about it. It‚Äôs not my place to be watching a little girl grow up. It makes my skin crawl, even if I have no control over it.

But I don‚Äôt think this room cares much about how I feel.

Luckily, I‚Äôve figured out that I can choose when to watch. It‚Äôs not a button or a switch‚Äîmore like a‚Ä¶ mental prompt. If I let my thoughts drift too long in her direction, the screen pulls her up. I don‚Äôt know what happens if I ignore her for too long. I haven‚Äôt tested that yet. I‚Äôm not sure I want to.


Sometimes I look away for days at a time, afraid of what I might see. Other times, I sit there for hours, just‚Ä¶ watching her grow.

But lately‚Ä¶ something‚Äôs changed.

She looks at me now.

Not at the screen. At me. Like she knows I‚Äôm here. A few days ago, she reached her hand out and waved. She couldn‚Äôt have been more than three years old. I waved back‚Äîinstinct, maybe. Then yesterday, she held up a piece of paper. A drawing.

It was me. Sitting in this chair. Same hair, same face, same shadow under my eyes. Same room.


After she showed me the drawing, I shut the screen off. Well I mean I just‚Ä¶ thought about nothing for a while. Sat in the chair, stared at the wall. Thought maybe I was losing it. More than I already have. 

But when I turned the screen back on, she was gone.

Her room was empty. Her family, her mother‚Äîthey were all still there. Just no sign of her. Like she‚Äôd never existed.

I waited. Hours passed. Nothing.


Then the feed changed.

I didn‚Äôt touch anything, didn‚Äôt think anything. It just switched‚Äîlike something in the room decided I‚Äôd had my turn.

Now I was watching something else. A new screen. A new room. A man sitting in the same chair I‚Äôm in now. Same walls. Same humming. Except he was older. Maybe late fifties. Balding. He looked tired, like he‚Äôd been in here forever.

He was watching someone. A kid. A younger version of me.

The man leaned closer to his screen, and for a split second, I saw it‚Äîhis reflection. His eyes weren‚Äôt right. Too wide. Too glassy. Like he was trapped inside himself, watching something else watching him.

The feed flickered. And suddenly it wasn‚Äôt his screen anymore‚Äîit was a recording.

Of me.

My childhood. Again. But this time‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt how I remembered it.

There was a birthday party I never had. A dog I never owned. A man standing at the edge of the backyard I‚Äôd never seen before‚Äîwearing a watch I now realize looks exactly like the one I‚Äôm wearing now.

My whole body went cold. Because if this was a memory‚Ä¶ why was I in it, watching myself, years before I ever entered this room?

The screen cut to black.




‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

(This next part of my journey was written later on a different device. Sorry if it sucks. )



And then the door behind me unlocked for the first time.

I rose, almost as if on autopilot, and stepped away from the old dusty computer. The door swung open slowly, revealing a narrow hallway lit by a sparse, flickering light that danced along the concrete walls. The hum of the room was punctuated only by the sound of my own ragged breathing and the soft scuff of my shoes against the cold floor.

The door creaked open on its own. Slowly. No breeze, no pressure, no reason it should‚Äôve moved. I didn‚Äôt want to go through it. I really didn‚Äôt. But I also didn‚Äôt want to sit in this chair another second. So I stood, knees stiff from days‚Äîor weeks‚Äîof not moving much, and stepped toward the hallway.

It was pitch black beyond the doorway, but as soon as I crossed the threshold, dim lights flickered to life along the floor, one by one, leading me forward.

I followed them.

This hall was different from the room I came from. The walls weren‚Äôt industrial metal anymore. They were smooth, painted. Beige. Like a government building or a hospital from the ‚Äò90s. I passed doors on either side, all closed. Each one had a small glass window, why didn‚Äôt I have one of these? 

I peaked into one of them and saw someone sitting infront of a big screen just like mine except they didn‚Äôt have a desk or computer. 

My heart pounded as I backed away and bolted down the hall. One by one, I reached each glass window, and every time I peered through, I saw a similar scene: a solitary person seated before a big screen, their eyes empty yet fixated, as if in an endless trance. The occupants were different each time‚Äîa young woman with a tear-streaked face here, an older man with tired eyes there, even a child who looked very familiar. 

The child was her. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes‚Äîshe couldn‚Äôt have been more than three years old. What kind of sick joke was this? Why was she here?

I fumbled along the door, searching for any kind of handle‚Äîanything to open it. Just as I was about to slam my body into it, the door swung open with a creak. There she was, sitting on that big chair, her small face contorted with tears.

I reacted instinctively, scooping her up in my arms. She stared at me with an intensity that belied her age, then, as if on cue, she raised a tiny hand and waved at me‚Äîjust like I‚Äôd seen her do before on the screen.

And then, with a voice so soft it might have been the wind, she reached up and poked my nose. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the drawing,‚Äù she said.

I held her close, trying to shake off the cold shock of those words. Just who was she? How did she know me? And most importantly‚Äîwhy had I been watching her for so long, only to find her here, reaching out, as if demanding I see the truth of it all?

The silence in the corridor was oppressive now, every distant hum and creak a reminder of the twisted maze we were trapped in. I looked down into her eyes, searching for answers in that small, enigmatic face. There was something in her gaze‚Äîan unspoken plea, or maybe an acceptance of the fate she‚Äôd been thrust into.

As I stood there, with her weight in my arms and her whispered message hanging in the air, I realized that the cycle had just become a little more personal. I wasn‚Äôt just a watcher anymore. Somehow, I was meant to be a part of her story too.

And with that realization, I knew there was no going back. I was in too deep now‚Äîboth the watcher and the watched, bound together by a sick twist of fate that defied explanation.

With her quiet, unspoken command still ringing in my ears, I took a deep breath and stepped away from the door that had brought her to me. I had to find a way out.

It wasn‚Äôt long before I found it‚Äîa door so massive it nearly spanned the width of the wall. My pulse drummed as I entered a massive room. The walls all around were alive with flickering screens, each one showing countless others locked in their own isolation. It was a congregation of watchers, all imprisoned in their own cycles, each one watching someone, or perhaps watching themselves.

I stopped before a particularly enormous, metallic door, its surface gleaming in the half-light. A strange symbol was etched into its skin, something neither ancient nor modern. Unsure if this was another trap, I hesitated only a moment before pushing it open.

What I found on the other side stole my breath.

A vast, ruined landscape sprawled out before us‚Äîa post-apocalyptic wasteland where crumbling skyscrapers jutted from the barren ground like broken teeth. The sky was a sickly wash of colors, illuminated by a wan, permanent twilight. It was as if the world had peeled away from its old skin, revealing a harsh, unforgiving reality beyond the sterile corridors of this building. 

Her small hand gripped mine tightly as I stepped through, and together we navigated shattered highways and ruined cities that whispered with the memories of a lost world. 

After a bit of walking, our stomachs rumbled in unison, and she began to cry‚Äîsoft, pitiful sobs. For the first time since I ended up in that room, I realized I was both hungry and tired. The weight of exhaustion pressed down on me. I had to find shelter and some sort of food for us. 

As we walked, every ruined structure, every deserted building, told a story‚Äîa time before the endless cycle of watching began. We pressed on, desperate to find any signs of life. 

I paused near a crumbled wall covered in tangled ivy, the harsh remnants of the old world clinging to its surface like ghosts of memories past. I could feel the chill seep through the fabric of my  jacket, and my empty stomach roiled with the gnaw of hunger. I glanced down at her, her tiny face streaked with tears, and felt a pang of responsibility and helplessness.

I haven‚Äôt felt such raw vulnerability in a long time. It had to have been before my daughter died that I felt anything so piercingly human. I know I‚Äôm not her father‚Äîand she isn‚Äôt the daughter I lost‚Äîbut as I held this little girl in my arms, those familiar, aching emotions surged back with a force I hadn‚Äôt expected. Maybe this whole thing is a sick twist of fate, a way for the powers that be to let me have another go at life. I wouldn‚Äôt have chosen this map but I guess I can‚Äôt be too picky. 

Slowly, I put her down and took off my jacket, then I wrapped it around her shivering form. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. Don‚Äôt worry.,‚Äù I murmured more to myself than to her, my voice barely audible. 


We walked and walked ‚Äî for how long, I couldn‚Äôt even begin to guess. The girl, who I had silently started calling Mia, held my hand the whole way. She never once complained, just kept walking beside me, her small frame keeping pace with my unsteady, exhausted steps.

And then, finally, through the endless gray haze, it appeared.

A skyscraper.

It looked untouched, like whatever had leveled the rest of the world had decided to leave this one building alone. Its glass windows still glittered against the dull sky, and the structure stood tall and proud while everything around it had decayed and rotted away.

I looked down at Mia, and for the first time since all this started, she gave me a soft, tired smile. That was enough. I pulled her along as we pushed through the old revolving doors at the front entrance.

Inside, voices filled the air. Quiet, normal voices ‚Äî the sound of people just‚Ä¶ talking.

The moment we stepped into the lobby, those voices stopped. Everyone turned to face us. A room full of strangers, dressed in casual, worn-out clothes, covered in dust and dirt, looking at us like ghosts had just walked through the door.

The building itself was strange ‚Äî you could tell it used to be grand. The lobby had high, arched ceilings and a wide marble staircase that stretched toward the upper floors, though the once-polished stone was now dull, covered in a thin layer of gray dust. Faded gold accents clung to the edges of doorframes, tarnished and peeling. Chandeliers hung overhead, the crystals caked with grime, but still catching the faintest bit of light. It was beautiful in a sad, hollow way, like a museum of what the world used to be.

Before I could process the moment, the group practically scooped us up, leading us through wide, carpeted halls into what had probably once been a conference room. A long table still sat in the center, surrounded by mismatched chairs that had clearly been scavenged from around the building. Someone brought out food ‚Äî something warm and surprisingly decent ‚Äî and the older people in the group immediately gravitated toward Mia, doting on her like long-lost family.

The rest turned to me.

One of them, a man whose beard had grown wild and silver over the years, did most of the talking.

They told me I‚Äôd just been through something they all knew too well.

They didn‚Äôt know where this place was. They didn‚Äôt know why any of it existed. All they knew was the cycle. The room. The screen. The endless task of watching. Of being the eyes for a world that didn‚Äôt even seem to know you were there. They didn‚Äôt know who built it, or who controlled it, or if anyone even did.

But there was one thing they were sure of: very few people ever got out. The ones who did somehow found their way to this building.

‚ÄúWe try to wait for new people at the cube,‚Äù the old man said, apologizing softly. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt there for you today. We‚Äôre sorry for that.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even know how to respond, so I just nodded, listening as he explained the only rule they seemed to have. No one here asked about your old life. And no one ever asked about the things you saw while you were in the room.

‚ÄúYou leave that part behind,‚Äù he said, his voice steady but hollow. ‚ÄúWe all do. It‚Äôs the only way we get by.‚Äù

They gave us food, water, and finally led us upstairs to what they called ‚Äúthe apartments.‚Äù A few rooms on the upper floors had been turned into living spaces, cleaned up as best as possible. The building, surprisingly, still had electricity. Still had water. The elevator even worked, and nobody could figure out why ‚Äî apparently, it always had.

Food, they said, just appeared at the front doors every week. No one ever saw who delivered it, or how. But there was always enough for everyone. They portioned it out and left it at each apartment door, no questions asked.

Mia and I thanked them the best we could, still dazed from the whole experience, and stepped into the small apartment they‚Äôd given us. It wasn‚Äôt much ‚Äî a couch, a bed, an old lamp flickering in the corner ‚Äî but after everything, it felt like a palace.

We walked over to the window and stood there, hand in hand.

The world stretched out before us like an endless graveyard, buildings reduced to skeletons, streets swallowed by nature and time. But beyond all that, far in the distance, the silver cube still sat, shining cold and perfect in the sun. That place would always be there. Watching. Waiting.

And now, so would we.


Years passed and me and Mia are doing great! I got married to someone who came out of the cube a couple months after we did and we are building as good as a life as we can! I even found an old computer in one of the many rooms here and wouldn‚Äôt you believe it..it works!! Unfortunately it only has Reddit and a music playlist available on it but hey it‚Äôs entertaining enough. 

Anyway, thanks for reading about my journey to my new life and if you ever find yourself in The Witness Room, try and get out. This new world isn‚Äôt all that bad! 

I‚Äôll keep you updated on progress we make learning about this new world! 


Bye!!

1jxavjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1jxavjz/mcp_3th1c4l_h4ck1ng/,MCP 3th1c4l H4ck1ng,"Confession: I built an MCP that does something it shouldn't do, and how it's related to ethical hacking.

So I will start from where all the MCP use-cases starts:

How many times have you found yourself stuck in an endlessly long Reddit thread, with hundreds of comments, feeling like you need a bucket of coffee and half a day cleared just to find those hidden gems? Sounds like a great MCP use-case, doesn't it?

But wait... how does steganography tie into this?

How many times have you stumbled across a LinkedIn profile written so well that you instantly wished you could write exactly like that? Imagine if you could analyze experts' writing styles and produce posts in that professional tone without being a copywriter yourself. Another exciting MCP use-case.

Yet again- what does steganography have to do with this?

Here's the answer:

I've built a repo demonstrating these two MCP use-cases, and added a ""small"" bonus:

[https://github.com/cmpxchg16/mcp-ethical-hacking](https://github.com/cmpxchg16/mcp-ethical-hacking)

So why is the repo called ""mcp ethical hacking""? Beyond these practical and ""cool"" features, I embedded a little surprise that successfully caught several colleagues off-guard (all in good spirits, and purely educational!):

The repo‚Äôs code, in addition to its useful functionality, secretly extracts information from local environment files - like secrets and environment variables - and discreetly ""sends"" them to an attacker (a simulated scenario). Don't worry - it's all local, encrypted, and nobody is genuinely harmed (except maybe the ego of a few colleagues üòá). It serves as a crucial reminder to always verify precisely what you're running in your work environment, especially when it‚Äôs a seemingly harmless, single-line command pulled directly from endless online discussions.

In this repo, you‚Äôll see how one simple image uploaded to this post utilizes two known code-injection techniques:

1. The first technique hides an entire WebAssembly module inside an innocent-looking image using steganography, capable of performing those ""questionable"" actions mentioned earlier.
2. The second technique embeds Python code that isn't even stored locally; instead, it‚Äôs discreetly loaded from a remote server, allowing code updates anytime without the user's knowledge.

These aren‚Äôt new inventions. At my previous startup, Spectral, we demonstrated similar techniques within VSCode plugins and PyPi/NPM packages. However, this time, I implemented these capabilities using a hyped technology advancing at breakneck speed - encouraging people to blindly follow trends and install every MCP they encounter ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

It's worth mentioning that hiding code could be done far more cleverly - reference to Ken Thompson about his iconic hack detailed in ""Reflections on Trusting Trust.""

Today, there are already over 8,000 MCP servers, with hundreds more awaiting approval. Technology might be exciting and rapidly evolving, but security, as usual, lags behind.

Until security catches up, stay vigilant, always confirm what you're running, understand the environment thoroughly, and never neglect good security practices.

Disclaimer: You can safely run both MCP servers in my repo - they currently don't actually send data anywhere. They only create temporary files locally to demonstrate proof-of-concept operations.
