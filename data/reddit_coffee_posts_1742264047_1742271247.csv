I have a J Ultra and it is a very good grinder. But as someone who pretty much exclusively drinks very light, very fruity coffees, and likes a lot of clarity in my espresso, I find that I do not quite get that with the J Ultra. Which has left me looking for something that will give me that bit more clarity. The Pietro seems like it would be a good option, but I travel a lot, and the J ultra I'm traveling with now is already bigger than I'd ideally want to be carrying, I definitely don't want to go bigger. This has left me kinda thinking about something like a zp6. I know it is not designed for espresso, and can't really do normal espresso. But, I'm using a mix of a 49mm convex (which needs a crazy coarse grind) and a relatively high dose (19-21g) standard 49mm, all polled more around 5-6 bar than 8-9. So none of my shots are ever that finely ground. Has anyone used a zp6 for espresso and had success? Did it give you shots with a lot of clarity? If a zp6 is not the way to go, what else would you recommend?

1jdwddt,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1jdwddt/the_second_chapter_for_my_novelette_pulse/,"The Second Chapter for My Novelette, ‚ÄúPulse‚Äù","Chapter Two - ‚ÄúPulse‚Äù:


Ray stepped out onto the pavement. 

The air was crisp, regulated beneath the dome's tempered glow. Around him, the city moved with quiet efficiency‚Äîtrams gliding soundlessly along their tracks, the hum of distant turbines threading through the air.

A few passersby turned as he walked, some offering nods of recognition. A pair of students on a nearby bench glanced up from their tablets, their whispered exchange just faintly audible. Ray paid them little mind.

At the edge of the transit lane, a cab slowed to meet him, its polished surface reflecting the structured skyline. 

He stepped inside, and the door sealed with a near-silent hiss. The dashboard flickered on to display a smooth trajectory across the city.

Ray settled back, watching as the city unfurled outside the window. Towering structures of glass and steel curved into the sky, their surfaces shifting with dynamic solar panels. Bridges stretched across the city's canals, where the water ran dark and still, unbroken save for the controlled movements of filtration skimmers. 

The cab navigated through it all with quiet precision, each motion calculated, each turn anticipated.

At last, the headquarters of the Astronomic Science Authority came into view‚Äîits stark, angular silhouette cutting against the cityscape. 

The cab eased to a halt, and as Ray stepped out, he allowed himself a single breath.

Then, with confidence, he made his way inside.



The halls of the ASA hummed with quiet intensity, a steady undercurrent of conversation and distant machinery forming the pulse of the institution. 

Scientists moved with purpose, their voices low yet charged, exchanging theories, data, and half-finished thoughts as they passed between sterile glass-paneled laboratories. 

The walls bore digital readouts‚Äîequations, simulations, real-time telemetry‚Äîupdating in smooth, flickering intervals.

Ray walked with measured purpose, shoulders squared, hands clasped before him. He gave brief nods of acknowledgment as he passed, but none thought to stop him. 

The halls pulsed with urgency‚Äîscientists moved briskly, some deep in murmured discussion, others frowning at data readouts while a few scratched notes onto clipboards. A few stood motionless in thought, staring past their own calculations. 

The ASA never truly stilled; minds worked even when bodies paused.

A glint of light caught his eye‚Äîhis gaze flicked to a nearby lab. 

A scientist stood alone, unmoving, staring into the glow of a console. The screen's pale light reflected off his glasses, obscuring his expression. 

Though curious, Ray moved on.

As he neared his division, a sudden presence jolted into his path.

""Oh! Hello!"" The voice was bright, self-assured‚Äîperhaps overly so. The young woman before him stood with easy confidence, dressed in a manner that straddled professionalism and personal ease. ""You're Godfrey, yes?""

Ray barely opened his mouth before she pressed on.

""Good, good. Thought so. Which means I've found the right division, seeing as, well... you're here.""

Ray gave a slow, measured nod. ""Indeed. I received word from headquarters regarding your appointment. I am to‚Äî""

""Teach me, yes, yes‚ÄîI know.""

The interruption was swift, almost instinctual‚Äîthen a¬† flicker of embarrassment crossed her face, and when she caught Ray's expression, she faltered.

""O-oh, I, um‚ÄîI didn't mean to‚Äî"" she straightened, exhaling sharply as if resetting herself. ""P-please, continue.""

She crossed her arms, her expression teetering between an apologetic grimace and an uneasy smile.

A brief silence stretched between them. Ray regarded her for a moment longer, then turned sharply on his heel.

""Come along now. There is much to learn.""



Ray strode through the division with efficiency, his gait swift yet unhurried. He moved not as a guide but as a man retracing familiar steps, pointing out key features as they passed.

""This corridor houses our primary computational systems‚Äîhigh-density quantum processors running near absolute zero. Processing cores are suspended in a vacuum chamber to prevent heat contamination. Here, the primary astrophysical simulations are conducted‚Äîgravitational lensing, dark matter distributions, orbital mechanics, all updated in real time.""

The newcomer trailed behind, nodding, though she had little time to process each detail before sidestepping an upcoming colleague.

Ray stopped abruptly at a glass partition, gesturing to the room beyond. ""That,"" he said, ""is the photonic spectrometer array. We extract data from deep-field observations, parse light signatures down to individual photons‚Äîuseful for stellar composition analysis, exoplanet atmospheres, and‚Äî""

He pivoted before finishing, already moving again. The intern hurried to catch up, muttering under her breath.

He stopped at a smooth, circular indentation in the wall‚Äîno signage, no visible function. 

He ran a finger along its surface, nodding to himself before turning back.

""The entire facility is built upon a superconductor-laced substructure,"" he explained. ""Minimal energy loss. Even waste heat is siphoned into secondary systems‚Äîpassive temperature regulation, water purification. Efficiency is paramount.""

She frowned. ""That... thing you just touched. What is it?""

Ray glanced at it again. ""Ah. A recessed access panel. Maintenance ports are hidden in plain sight‚Äîcleaner aesthetic.""

She raised an eyebrow. ""Concealing maintenance ports in the name of aesthetics... seems impractical.""

Ray resumed his brisk pace, weaving through the winding corridors, occasionally stopping to observe something only he seemed to find significant‚Äîa particular alignment of conduits, the faint hum of a cooling system, the way a readout flickered in a pattern imperceptible to most.

She fell behind again.

Then, a pause. Ray slowed, scanning the space for another point of interest. A moment of quiet settled between them.

She took the opportunity.
""Beatrice,"" she said simply.

Ray stopped mid-step, turning to her. ""... Surname?""

The question caught her off guard, but she recovered quickly. ""Whitmore. Beatrice Whitmore.""

Ray tilted his head slightly. He rather liked the name. ""Interesting. Miss Whitmore, then.""

Beatrice smirked. ""I'm a married woman, Mister Godfrey.""

Ray stiffened, and his eyes flickered. ""Oh... my apologies. I... assumed someone your age wouldn't have settled down yet.""

She scoffed. ""I'm twenty-four, for your information.""

Ray hesitated, then gave a short nod. ""Apologies, then.""

They continued walking.
Ray was noticeably slower.



After more walking, more of the intricacies of the Division, Beatrice stopped.

A light flashed bright from beyond a window overlooking the city below.

Beatrice stared, then interrupted Ray's guidance with, ""Isn't it mad? How light can come and go, yet never be truly destroyed?""

Ray halted mid-step. He hadn't expected her to say something of value.

""I mean, everything breaks down in the end, doesn't it? All matter will collapse, the stars will burn out, even the laws of physics might unravel one day. But light‚Äîonce it's out there, it just keeps going. The only thing that can stop... I don't know‚Äîmore light?"" She chuckled, pushing away from the window.

Ray studied her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then, finally, he spoke.

""It is an interesting thought."" A pause. ""I have considered the same.""

Beatrice turned to him, eyebrows raised. ""Oh, really? So I can hold a conversation with you, then.""

Ray exhaled‚Äînot quite amusement, but something close. ""Occasionally.""

Beatrice smirked, then turned back to the window. Ray lingered a moment longer before continuing forward.



Finally, after roughly two hours of guidance, Beatrice got the gist of the Division and they both went for a break in the main lobby.

""Well... I'll be processing that for a decade,"" Beatrice said, resting her face in her palms.

""I know, I know, it's much‚Äîeven some people who have worked months here still come across new things.""

Ray then passed a cup of coffee over to Beatrice, who drank it immediately.

""I love it here,"" Ray said, looking around the place with reverence. ""Even five years later, I still find something new to learn, some new problem to solve. It just keeps giving.""

Familiarity settled in Ray's face. ""If you've got what it takes, if you've got the determination, you can do anything.""

Beatrice smiled, and, after a moment, nodded confidently.

Ray checked his wristwatch and exhaled softly. ""That will do for today. We'll resume tomorrow,"" he said. 

Then, fixing his gaze on Beatrice, he continued in a measured tone, ""But tonight, you remain for a preliminary trial‚Äîa test of the fundamentals of our division's operations.""

He gestured toward a nearby console displaying a streamlined interface. ""Your task is straightforward: verify the calibration of the photonic spectrometer array. Ensure its readings conform to our established baselines, then log the data accurately. Think of it as confirming the basics‚Äîthe foundation upon which all our advanced analyses depend.""

His expression grew sterner. ""Any missteps won't just set you back‚Äîthey'll reflect on me as well. But I've no doubt you'll handle yourself just fine.""

He started to turn away, then hesitated. His gaze flicked back to Beatrice, considering her for a moment longer than necessary.

""...You can do this.""


Ray stepped into the elevator, pressing a biometric panel with his thumb. A soft chime, then rapid descent. 

He barely felt the motion‚Äîmagnetic acceleration made it near-instantaneous. 

Floors blurred past on the digital display, and within seconds, he reached the ground level. 

The doors whispered open, revealing the polished expanse of the ASA lobby.

He moved toward the exit, but just as he neared the glass doors, a figure stepped into his path.

Ray halted. Immediately, his posture shifted‚Äîstraightening, hands clasping instinctively behind his back.

""Mr. Ford,"" he said, lifting his chin up slightly. ""A surprise, but never an unwelcome one. Something the matter?""

The man before him, Gregory Ford, was a veteran of the ASA‚Äînearing fifty, but with the physique of a man who never truly stopped working. His grey-streaked hair was neatly combed back, his sharp eyes piercing into Ray.

""Mr. Godfrey,"" Ford said evenly, ""I apologize for delaying you, but I need you at Headquarters. Our chief scientist has reported something... unusual.""

Ray tensed. Ford did not use words like unusual lightly.

""... Could‚Äîcould this not have been sent as a message?"" He hesitated, glancing at his watch. ""I need to return to my wife before nightfall‚Äî""

""I don't want any chance of my message being intercepted."" Ford's voice was firm, final.

Ray exhaled slowly, rolling his sleeve back down. 'Just a moment longer,' he told himself.

He allowed a brief, knowing smile before turning sharply on his heel. ""Come.""

Together, they crossed the lobby and stepped into another lift. This one was different‚Äîrestricted access, destination locked. 

The moment the doors sealed, the floor rose beneath them, a sensation of controlled velocity. The ascent was smooth, but the sheer speed was undeniable.

Headquarters sat at the very top of the ASA complex. As the lift doors opened, Ray took a step inside‚Äîa stark, functional space, walls lined with high-resolution displays streaming real-time data from deep-space observation arrays. 

The lighting was subdued, designed to reduce eye strain during long hours of work. Desks curved seamlessly into integrated consoles, and a window overlooked the distant sprawl of buildings.

In the center of the room, a small office stood encased in reinforced glass. And inside, slumped over a cluttered desk, sat the head scientist.

Dr. Elias Monroe.

Ray had known him for years. He was not an excitable man. Yet even from a distance, it was clear‚Äîsomething had shaken him.

Ford strode forward and knocked twice on the office window. Monroe jumped, rubbing his temples before hurriedly ushering them in.

The office was dimly lit, paper notes scattered among holographic readouts. Monroe barely spared a greeting before diving straight in.

""I assume you've already briefed him?"" he asked Ford, voice tight with exhaustion.

""Not yet."" Ford folded his arms, giving Monroe space to explain.

The scientist exhaled sharply, nodding to himself as if ordering his thoughts. Then, he turned to Ray.

""We picked up something in deep space‚Äîan anomaly. A signal, rhythmic. But it doesn't match any known pattern‚ÄîJX-914, I would guess.""

Ray's brow furrowed. ""JX-914?""

Monroe tapped a few keys on his console. A star map flickered on, pinpointing a location far beyond mapped territory.

""Interstellar void,"" Monroe muttered. ""No planets. No pulsars. Nothing but vacuum."" 

He rubbed his jaw, shaking his head. ""And yet, we detected something. Which raises the question... how could we still detect something that far away?""

Silence.

Ray stared at the data, mind already turning over possibilities.

A spark lit his eyes.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

However, I really want to lose the weight I gained since having my baby a year and a half ago. I was 177lbs before getting pregnant and have been stuck at 197lbs since having my son. My highest weight was 205lbs (I'm 31/F and 5 '6').

I decided if I am serious about losing weight, I need to at least look at nutrition labels when I can, even if I don't track every single calorie I eat. I was shocked to discover that a tablespoon of my coffee cream is 35 calories, and I was free-pouring it. When I did measure, I discovered I like about 4 tablespoons (but probably poured more sometimes due to just dumping it in).

With one coffee in the morning and one in the evening, that's practically 300 calories per day. I'd taken pride in the fact that I rarely drink pop or juice, so I knew I wasn't drinking my calories that way. But I had no idea I was drinking so many in my coffee. Wake up call!

I greatly enjoy it, so I don't want to cut it out entirely, but I am going to taper off how much cream I add. Lately, I've been going on more walks, but I didn't realize I'm just drinking the calories that those walks are burning.

Since that shock, I've made an effort to look at labels more often, so I can make more informed choices. Sometimes, I read the label and think, ""I don't want it that much,"" and put it back.

I know it's so basic, but it's also so easy to be ignorant. So this is me saying even if you don't want to track every mouthful or weigh every portion - and if you do, great, it's probably very effective - at least look at labels when you can.

Even if you decide to eat or drink the thing, at least you'll be informed. Otherwise, you feel like you're putting in effort and seeing no result without even realizing you're sabotaging yourself, and that's the worst.

I've applied to 227 jobs since January, with only 2 interviews. I have a banking, mortgage, insurance, and finance background. I've applied for a ton of jobs in my field and have heard nothing back from those, including 14 jobs at webster bank that all 90% match my background. 

To be fair, not all jobs I've applied for have been exactly my background, but a lot have been things that I have experience in from when I was a teenager, or would generally be considered entry level. Jobs I've applied to a bit outside my recent experience, but in line with my previous experience include receptionist positions, front desk at two different gyms, office admin, mattress sales, furniture sales, a coffee shop barista, a beer tapper for a brewery, a restaurant hostess, customer service, call center, dog walker, outside sales and so on. 

Of the two I've had interviews for, one they simply decided to go with another candidate, and the other tested me on a software I was familiar with but hadn't used the current version of, so I was dismissed as they said they were unwilling to do any training. 

I'm sure that part of the issue is that I've moved around a bit in the past few years, leaving my home state, and then getting engaged and moving to my fianc√©s home state.

there's been some conflicts with a friend recently. if i went into detail the post would be three times as long, so i'll sum it up ‚Äî he has made myself and other friends in our group upset by breaking boundaries or saying or doing some pretty fucking stupid shit that anyone would be mad at. then when he is called out, he gets upset until we coddle him. with every conflict we have to tell him the same thing: ""we are JUSTIFIABLY upset at your ACTIONS. we do not HATE YOU"". he has historically suffered toxic friendships and is distrustful of people, which leads him to jump to the worst possible conclusion more often than not ‚Äî thinking people's thoughts for them, assuming everyone hates him or avoiding difficult conversations because in his mind he already ""knows"" he will face rejection, ect.

recently he'd been doing this to me in relation to conflicts he's having with our friend and my boyfriend. he was also saying some pretty shitty stuff about them, so when i told him that i'd had enough and that a boundary had to be drawn, he responded with ""well then i'm just fucked then"". i told him to knock that shit off, that that is an absolutely unacceptable way to respond to a boundary and that i cannot keep having the same conversation with him. he apologised but i still needed time to cool off, so we didn't talk for a week.

today, he shows up to class late (we're studying vet nursing) and sits down next to me. i glance at him, but mostly just keep my eyes on the lecture until morning tea. he follows me and tells me that he wanted to tell me he just signed papers to drop out. i'm kinda like jesus *christ* are you kidding me. why. he then tells me that because i'm CHARISMATIC i'm gonna tell everyone in our class about our conflict and they're all going to hate him????

baby this ain't highschool, what the FUCK are you talking about. i dont even talk to people in class that much, at least not to a level of conversation where i'd be bitching to them about my social life. i water cooler talk with my classmates and that's it. i just kinda blinked at him and told him that was disappointing to hear, but i'm not going to say sorry for something he concocted in his head, i can't be responsible for that. the last thing he snaps at me is ""well you don't take responsibility for much, do you?"", so i paused, grabbed my coffee and said ""well that's the end of that then"". he said goodbye with tears in his eyes and i turned and walked back to class. i'm usually pretty careful to show empathy and soften a blow where i can but it gets to a point where you've lost your ability to care. i was cold but it was deserved atp. he's not going to try to guilt me into taking responsibility for his career-ruining decision. don't let people do this shit to you.",3,1742267533.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I tried to recount everything to the best of my abilities from memory. If this gets big, I will be deleting for privacy reasons. 

For context: I live with two roommates let‚Äôs call them K and J, and we are all in our last year of university. The three of us are very friendly with each other and consider ourselves friends, not just roommates. We also have each other‚Äôs locations. 

In our second semester of our second year of university, J had a class with a young, part-time professor (let‚Äôs call him D) and K and I would always make jokes about J sleeping with him because we were bored university students and who doesn‚Äôt want to live their Y/N fantasy, right? Another reason why this was a joke was because J was in a committed relationship of over 5 years and of course this guy was a professor, so we didn‚Äôt think it was even in the realm of possibility. It is worth noting, the age gap between J and D was not a problem or even weird (all things considered),  it is the fact that there is a HUGE power imbalance and one other thing which will be mentioned later on. Whenever J would go to office hours we‚Äôd be ask ‚Äúare you sure you don‚Äôt want to wear a little makeup‚Äù or ‚Äúare you sure you don‚Äôt want to wear something more revealing‚Äù and things like because, again, we were bored university students being silly. Nothing interesting happened during this semester ‚Äî that we were aware of. 

Fast forward to the beginning of first semester of third year, J would go on random walks alone on very non-scenic routes near the highway on-ramp (there is a very famous scenic path that our college town is known for where everyone walks and she would never walk there) and she would get coffee randomly before class at cafes in the ‚Äòfinancial district‚Äô so to speak, which is nowhere near our house or school (J she doesn‚Äôt drink coffee either). At the time, I thought it was out of the ordinary but didn‚Äôt think anything of it. One day, she very abruptly breaks up with her boyfriend without having ever mentioned anything bad about him prior to this. Quite literally the next day, while on one of her solo journeys, she ‚Äòbumped into‚Äô D and once they got to talking the conversation quickly turned flirty. The three of us had a chuckle and kicked our feet and left it at that. The ‚Äòserendipity‚Äô did  not end there, J would ‚Äòbump into‚Äô D on several other occasions and the flirtations only amplified. At the time, we knew that J and her boyfriend were broken up and since the three of us would joke about J sleeping with D all the time, K and I told her to go for it. And go for it she did. For the rest of the semester, she engaged in a sexual relationship with this professor.  She would sleepover at his place, he would wine and dine her, pick her up from school, etc. K and I didn‚Äôt really care about their arrangement; she was single, he wasn‚Äôt her professor, so no harm, no foul. After Halloween there was almost no talk of D, we‚Äôd ask for updates, and she told us she hasn‚Äôt talked to him. 

Although there was no talk of D, K and I both knew she was texting him daily and she would go to his house every Thursday afternoon like clockwork (we knew this because we had her location and not because she voluntarily told us this). K and I assumed she would see him on Thursdays since we were out of the house all day because of class, and J wouldn‚Äôt need to explain herself. Where K and I took issue with her was not that she‚Äôd go to his house, but when asked what she did that day, she would conveniently omit her sojourn. On one occasion, we had asked her to pick up a few things from the grocery store for a communal dinner. When we came home from school and asked if she‚Äôd gone to the store, she said she hadn‚Äôt because she was tired, but we knew she had gone to D‚Äôs place that day. I started get peeved at her white lies and since I was peeved, I started thinking and a lot of her story wasn‚Äôt adding up. J‚Äôs walks and coffee runs were in fact not random at all ‚Äî her walks along the highway, in the middle of nowhere, are in the immediate vicinity of D‚Äôs apartment and the coffee shops in the ‚Äòfinancial district‚Äô were right across D‚Äôs full-time job where he takes his lunch. I slowly put the pieces together: she emotionally cheated on her boyfriend with D and broke up with him so she could be physically intimate with D without being labeled as a cheater. My opinion is J viewed D as the next best thing, he had two jobs that were well-respected, and he would always brag to J about how much money he had which K and I saw as manipulative but J liked since she is materialistic and likes when men can take care of her. This in and of itself is a lot to unpack; she‚Äôs one of those girls who desperately craves male validation/attention, is never single, and men fall easily for her. Even before D, she was always the type to string along men who clearly like her but would never flat out reject or ignore them because she didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòmean.‚Äô

This realization made me think poorly of her obviously, but one could argue ‚Äúat least she broke up with her boyfriend.‚Äù This is where things go downhill. 

End of November, K and I went back to our hometown for the weekend. J was still back in our college town alone but was invited by her friend, N, from back home, to go on a weekend trip to a nearby city.  J had mentioned N maybe once in passing, so I thought it was weird that somehow J was the first person N thought of to bring on this trip. J told us that N and her mother were going to a convention which is why they were making the trip. We were set to all be back at school on Sunday. On the Monday, my mom sends me a text saying she accidentally shipped an Amazon package to my college house, which was supposed to arrive on Saturday. I checked Amazon and it did in fact say the package was delivered but it was nowhere to be found. When I went to check our cameras, and I could not believe my eyes: D picked up J and her overnight bag on the day that she was supposed to be going on the trip with N and her mom. I was gutted and shocked. J had been texting us about N and her mom all weekend, making up stories and conversations that they had during this alleged trip. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I told K and she was also dumbfounded. We decided not to say anything because there was no friendly way to confront her about inventing a weekend trip that never happened. It was very embarrassing for J especially since a few days after the trip, she‚Äôd still bring up N and the trip‚Äîwhere they went to eat, how N let her wear her  Airpods Max during the drive, etc. To keep a VERY long story short, K and I decided to confront her after two separate events where she lied to my face about D but acted as if she was throwing me a bone by telling me this fake story.

When K and I planned to confront her, we decided not to bring up the trip because we thought it was really embarrassing. We decided we had enough ‚Äòevidence‚Äô (her location on Thursdays and the constant texting) that she was still seeing D and mentioning the trip would be too much. When we told her that we thought she was still seeing D and asked for updates, she told us she wasn‚Äôt seeing him anymore and if she ever went to his place she ‚Äúthought she mentioned it‚Äù to us and that WE probably forgot. This set me off because she has a history of lying and gaslighting like this, so I brought up the trip. Believe it or not she DENIED IT. She said ‚ÄúD picked me up to take me to N‚Äôs house‚Äù although geographically this doesn‚Äôt make sense seeing that N was one hour in the opposite direction and J had specifically said that N had picked her up at our house. She gaslit me and K for about 40 minutes, swearing up and down that she went on the trip with N and not D. Finally, I told her that I was going to ask her once more who she went with, and if she didn‚Äôt tell me the truth I was done with our friendship. She finally confessed and gave a half-assed apology. We told her we didn‚Äôt care about her relationship and her life decisions and that we just don‚Äôt want to be lied to. We told her we weren‚Äôt mad at her about lying but we said we‚Äôd get actually mad if she took a class with D in fourth year since it would be a conflict of interest and completely unethical. She said she agreed completely and will avoid his classes at all costs. Most importantly, we said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take this confrontation as an opportunity to lie better because we will find out.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt learn her lesson and of course continued to lie.

In second semester of third year, she got back together with her boyfriend but was still seeing D on the side while still lying to us about meeting with him. They wouldn‚Äôt meet at his house anymore since J‚Äôs boyfriend had her location and to our knowledge, she wasn‚Äôt single, so she had no reason to be at D‚Äôs house. She no longer left through the front door to meet with D and only used the backdoor where there are no cameras, but K and I had our ways of knowing when he came over. She would call him all the time and there was no ambiguity about her cheating anymore. At this point, D has also been sending her money, upwards of $1000, for rent and other living necessities. I won‚Äôt be disclosing how I found this out but rest assured, J did not tell me. This made me and K so angry, as you can imagine. Everything about it was absolutely abhorrent: although their sexual arrangement was morally grey due to the fact that D wasn‚Äôt currently her professor, the money definitely crossed many lines and school rules.  I know in my bones J sees this as D helping her, but I also know in my bones that D sees this as hush money. J does not have a job but her schooling is being fully funded by her parents so there was no excuse to be asking for money. There are so many other things that could be said to prove her infidelity and the stupidity of trying to lie to people you live with, but because the lying was so extensive and happened every day that I would be writing forever. We let everything slide since our talk in November because if the trip was embarrassing, cheating would be worse. Not only that, if she was gaslighting us with 4k evidence proof that she was with D, it would be a completely unproductive conversation to confront her with our suspicions and inferences. 

Fast forward to here, now, fourth year. J is taking an ELECTIVE class where D is the professor and is alleging no other class fits with her schedule. K and I are not surprised. We obviously know this isn‚Äôt true and of course there has been no conflict-of-interest form sent to the dean. When I found out I was livid and I wanted to report them to the dean but after thinking about it, I knew I would only be reporting it to make myself feel better and to have a sense of ‚Äòjustice.‚Äô The grade she‚Äôs going to receive also doesn‚Äôt matter as she is a bad student anyway so one good grade won‚Äôt fix 30 bad ones. At home, nothing good would come of this, I know I would be living in a toxic environment if I reported this. Yet whenever I see her, I am filled with so much distain I want to just scream. Anyone who has interacted with pathological liars knows, they feel so good about themselves when they lie. This is especially true for J, she fully believes she put one on us and that makes me even angrier, the fact that she thinks she‚Äôs smart enough to concoct these outright unbelievable schemes and think she‚Äôs getting away with it. 

What do I do?? Do I:

-	Let her continue lying? I suppose she‚Äôs only lying to herself and we‚Äôre only living together for one more year. After graduating I am imagining a clean break and not ending things badly. An explanation at the end of university seems pointless since that would just be bringing up old shit  However, I know that if K and I never talk to her she‚Äôs going to make up some story about how we were terrible people to her boyfriend, but does that matter? I guess not. It‚Äôs just taking the highroad has never been my thing, if I have a problem with a person I have to say it or else I‚Äôll drive myself crazy. 
-	Confront her with everything I know about her cheating from third year and that I obviously know D‚Äôs class isn‚Äôt the only one that fits in her schedule? What‚Äôs stopping me from doing this is that things went back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô after out confrontation in November; we remained good friends, and she continued to lie without a second thought. But if I confront her again, there‚Äôs no guarantee of normalcy and I‚Äôd be creating a bad home environment where things would be awkward and tense for a whole year. 
-	Do I report D after graduating? In this scenario I‚Äôd feel vindicated, and I don‚Äôt have to necessarily receive any consequences of confrontation with J since we don‚Äôt live together, and I don‚Äôt plan on talking to her ever again. But again, this seems like I am starting shit for not reason especially since by the end of this year, I‚Äôll most likely want to move on to greener pastures. 

Someone please tell me what to do, I have been living with this secret and I feel like there‚Äôs no right way to go about this. There‚Äôs so much missing from this story that would perhaps fill in the gaps of why I have no sympathy for her, but this was my life every day for two years, so there‚Äôs no way I could fit everything. Thanks for reading!

This mech has spoiled me - don't think I can go back to lighter mechs. After locking my arms I can target a location with a minimum of 60 damage. More with higher tier rifles and upgrades. As long as I can spot the cockpit the mech is toast. There is a long reload time - time to stretch & get a cup of coffee. Having 500+ armor pts and three assault lance mates to keep the enemy occupied is essential.

Would be interesting to see how my Annihilator stands up to Clan mechs. I'm playing in vanilla career mode, so no Clan invasion despite being well into the 32nd century.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I am a sole proprietor with an LLC (EIN and all). I freelance in the theatre industry and as such, my business expenses are pretty small, but my top spend categories are ‚Äòunusual‚Äô for a business. For example, I can write off tickets to movies or live shows as continuing education/current market research. And I network a lot over coffees and happy hours, so restaurants/dining is another big spend. 

  
I consistently expect my top categories to be entertainment and restaurants. Other categories that might top those once or twice a year: electronics stores (I need a new work laptop) and travel. 

  
Obviously, most business credit cards don‚Äôt cater to these categories, I‚Äôd probably be better served by a personal credit card. My question is: Could I put my LLC name on a personal business card? Or if that‚Äôs not possible, could I just open a new personal credit card and use that solely for business expenses and pay the bill via my LLC bank account? 

  
I doubt I‚Äôll spend more than $1000 a month on this card. I could probably up to $2000 per month and splurge on some big ticket items if I were trying to claim a bonus, but that‚Äôs my situation. Any help is appreciated! Also any recommendations!

  
\[What prompted this post: I liked the flexible spend categories of the US Bank Business Leverage card, but they expect their average user to be able to spend $7500 in 4 months to get their bonus, which is more than I‚Äôm expecting to spend. I know there are smaller-spend flexible category cards out there, but not in the business sphere.\]",1,1742266807.0,CreditCards,14,1.0,False

1jdvdkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1jdvdkq/2_am_another_long_night_of_pain/,2 am another long night of pain :))),"Unfortunately I just need to rant, so I apologise in advance, but if anyone has any advice on how to help a flare please please please say- it would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I‚Äôm at my wits end. I‚Äôm 19 and began to get recurrent UTIs from when I was 15. Basically just got chucked antibiotic after antibiotic. I‚Äôve had two of these infections become kidney infections, one of which lead me to not being able to take one of my A level exams. After fighting to be taken seriously by numerous doctors (I wish they would consider if they would still be laughing in my face if it were their daughter dealing with this) and staying patient with the long waiting lists, I eventually saw a urologist once who put me on hiprex. It helped with the infections initially but I kept getting flares much like a uti that wouldn‚Äôt necessarily show up on dip tests nor after being sent to the lab. It causes me debilitating pain, urgency, frequency. I know I‚Äôm supposed to avoid baths but honestly during a flare it‚Äôs the only place I don‚Äôt have to worry. It keeps me up at night and I just can‚Äôt put up with it anymore. Flares last anywhere between 2-6 days and I get them at least once a month, but often more. I am however extremely lucky and a family member helped me go private. Since then I‚Äôve had a specialist say they believe it‚Äôs painful bladder syndrome and another claimed today that it‚Äôs anxiety? Got put on Mirabegron for frequency (I believe is a muscle relaxant?

I‚Äôve mentioned it possibly being an embedded infection but they don‚Äôt think so bc my infections haven‚Äôt always been the same bacteria. There‚Äôs nothing more they can do for me they say and I‚Äôm awaiting bladder instillations in June via nhs. I‚Äôm just tired of this. But I know everyone here is. I‚Äôm laying here after finally dragging myself away from the toilet seat with a towel between my legs wondering how I‚Äôm going to navigate tomorrow and keep up with my responsibilities. I feel I have no answers, no pain relief. Some nights I simply just sob. I know nobody here can help me for certain figure out what could possibly be wrong, but if there‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt considered or something I may be able to use to help this flare I would seriously appreciate it. Just fyi, Ive tried logging what foods/ drinks may trigger a flare, taken demanose and probiotics, and typically avoid baths, alcohol, tea and coffee. For anyone out there struggling and in pain, just try to remember why I do- we are not alone. Even if these symptoms can make us feel our loneliest and lowest.

I‚Äôve always been curious‚Äîhow do Ethiopians generally see other East Africans, especially Rwandese and Kenyans? I‚Äôve lived in both countries, speak the languages, and have traveled through Bole International Airport a few times during layovers. I really liked Addis Ababa and hope to visit in the next few years.

One thing I‚Äôve been wondering about is intermarriage‚Äîdo Ethiopians marry people from other East African countries like Rwanda, or are there cultural or traditional restrictions? I don‚Äôt meet many Ethiopians where I live, so I don‚Äôt know if there are major cultural differences between us.

Tbh, I sometimes feel like Africans aren‚Äôt as united as we could be, even though we share so much history. In North America, all other races tend to look down on Africans, and if we don‚Äôt stand up for ourselves, others will walk all over us‚Äîyou probably know what I mean. Instead of focusing on differences, I wish we could collaborate more.

Recently, I attended an Ethiopian cultural event in Vancouver, Canada and it was an amazing experience. I learned quite a bit about the culture, the coffee farmers, and the traditions surrounding Ethiopian coffee. I‚Äôd love to have coffee with an Ethiopian someday and learn even more firsthand.

What are your thoughts? Looking forward to hearing different perspectives.

1jdva4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1jdva4d/2_weeks_in/,2 weeks in,"Hello everyone, I started carnivore two weeks ago. Goal is to lose body fat, less than 10 pounds. I‚Äôm 20F 5‚Äù3.5. So I started at 135 and my lowest about 5 days ago was 131. I know I‚Äôm not going to lose several pounds a week but here are my concerns. My period is late by a few days so I feel like I‚Äôm feeling slightly bloated from that. I weighed myself today and was 134 which I know isn‚Äôt 3 pounds of fat but still a little discouraging to see. I‚Äôm pretty skinny so that‚Äôs why my goal is more to just lean out. That‚Äôs also why I plan to do this for only like 5 more weeks. And my energy is still pretty low. It depends on the day like some days it‚Äôs higher than others and I have still been able to workout but I feel like for most of the day I‚Äôm dragging myself around. Before carnivore I had a very low fat diet (less than 45g) so maybe that‚Äôs why? I think my goal weight is like 126ish but I don‚Äôt know or care as long as I like my body

I‚Äôve been eating 4-6 eggs, 85/10 beef, sirloin cooked in butter, chicken drumsticks, shrimp, tuna, only had Parmesan a couple times and using garlic salt, onion salt, tajin, and a few other random seasons with no carbs. And for drinks I‚Äôve been hydrating (80-90oz daily) also drinking ultima electrolytes and black coffee in the morning ",4,1742266282.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

I call it ""Iron monk""ü§£

I have been using AI to get my regime dialed in. For reference I have at least 40lb of fat to lose, so I can afford to be in a pretty deep calorie deficit. 

Weekly Flow:

Mon/Wed/Fri: 20:4 Strict keto (<20g net carbs), 950-1500 kcal, deep ketosis.

Tue/Thu: Gym day, 20:4 Targeted keto (20-30g net carbs pre-gym), 1200-1500 kcal, brief ketosis dip then back in during fast.

Fri Night-Sun Noon: 40-hour monk fast, pure fat-burning. (Body weight exercises focused on core strength and flexibility, stretching, yoga, palates) 

Sodium: Push 3000-5000mg/day, especially Fri before the monk fast (e.g., salted meats, salt water).

I dirty fast with copious amounts of black coffee

Is it sustainable?  I don't know, but it's week 2 and I feel fuckin great and  I'm rarely hungry. Using AI to help with real time nutrition, electrolytes, and caffeine is a game changer!!

Look, I get it. You paid $99 (or $50 when they have 50%off) for Walmart+ and think that means ‚Äúfree grocery delivery all year.‚Äù But let‚Äôs break this down real quick.

	‚Ä¢	$99 a year / 52 weeks = about $1.90 per week
	‚Ä¢	Even if you order once a week, that‚Äôs less than the price of a gas station coffee
	‚Ä¢	Meanwhile, the driver who got out of bed, got dressed, rushed to Walmart, hand-picked your groceries, packed them in their car, and drove them to you? They get nothing unless you tip.

You know what $99 doesn‚Äôt cover?
	‚Ä¢	Gas (which isn‚Äôt free)
	‚Ä¢	Car maintenance (also not free)
	‚Ä¢	Time spent picking your groceries like you‚Äôre our own grandma (seriously, we put in effort)
	‚Ä¢	The fact that we could be doing something else but instead are running all over town to bring you food

Walmart+ is a convenience fee to Walmart‚Äîit‚Äôs not a wage for drivers. Drivers rely on tips to make this worth the time and expense.

If you can afford to have someone shop, bag, load, and deliver your groceries, you can afford to tip at least a few bucks. If you truly can‚Äôt? At least acknowledge the effort. A ‚Äúthank you‚Äù goes a long way.

And before anyone says, ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt tip because [insert excuse]‚Äù‚ÄîI give a free pass to seniors, disabled folks, and anyone genuinely struggling. But if you‚Äôre placing multiple orders a week and flexing a stocked fridge while stiffing your driver? Yeah, we notice.

1. Plan way too many family vacations. (4-5 fam trips a year during holiday weekends, so my Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, thanksgiving, and Christmas are ALL TAKEN). I work a corporate job, so you know how important those days are for maxing out your PTO.

2. Always want to follow me and my husband (even my friend!) on trips. ‚ÄúHeard yall are going to xxx? I saw the tickets are cheap, we will just tag along.‚Äù Even when me and my friend are going to see a concert, they will still want to ‚Äútag along‚Äù. (Like why would you want to follow two 22 year old girls on their girls trip????)

3. Have unnecessary comments. ‚ÄúWhy do you go to target? You should be going to Walmart because it‚Äôs cheaper.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do you spend money on the stuff you don‚Äôt use?‚Äù (This is when I bought a $45 instant pot on Amazon when it was on sale. BTW, I have a decent job and make my own money.) ‚ÄúYou woke up at 1pm during a weekend, that‚Äôs SAD!‚Äù (Yep this is the exact word from my FIL. I was making my beautiful morning coffee and he walked in and ruined my morning.)

4. Have weird comments about my family. Since I am the only child, I am super close to my cousin who is also the only child. He‚Äôs technically my brother. He‚Äôs very very successful and retired at the age of 30 with his wife. They are just relaxing and traveling the world. FIL always asks me when are they going back to work because you can‚Äôt just stop working at 30. 

5. Now you might ask me why don‚Äôt we move out? Let me tell you the story. I agreed at first to move in after the wedding to save money, which was a GREAT mistake. One month in, FIL and MIL sat me down and had an hour long conversation with me about how we should move out to establish our own life routine as a couple. (Note they only talked to me not their son.) I immediately found an apartment 3 days later and told them about it, and MIL flipped. SHE LITERALLY CRIED TO ME about how she only has 3 sons and two of them already moved out so she doesn‚Äôt want the third son to move out. I was like: WTF? Wasn‚Äôt you the one told me to move out 3 days ago. Anyways, she said she felt hurt because of my act of wanting to move out.


I just wanna rant about this lol. It‚Äôs already hard working a corporate job right after college and i need some time to adjust to this transition. Now I feel drained after work being at somewhere I can never call home. I feel like I just can‚Äôt cope with my in-laws ever. Maybe I am not a nice DIL, but I just can‚Äôt be nice after all those things‚Ä¶.

the day we brought S's brother into the house he started displaying strange behaviors almost as if he was peeing in random spots around the living room but there would be nothing there. like he would pause there for a whole 5 minutes at a time and started doing it more often as time went on. 
that saturday i called the vet and scheduled an appt for the following saturday and they told me to separate him and see if he's peeing, if he didn't take him to an emergency vet. that day i separated and after a few hours he had definitely peed so i figured it was probably behavioral not something physically wrong and i could make it to saturday. but as time goes on he is doing this more and more frequently and when he does he will run and hide under the coffee table and just stay there which is a new spot for him. im so scared he has a urinary blockage because of his behaviors but i just can't afford to bring him to an emergency vet for the sake of me getting myself panicked. also as of tonight i pulled out a 4th litter box where he seems to be going to pee but not actually peeing which is freaking me out even more, but also could this be behavioral and he's overwhelmed with the additional animal and needs a private litter box? please help i love my boy and i am so scared.

I‚Äôve been vaping since 2019 and the longest I quit was 1 week for my honey moon. Started out as a social thing but become a bit habit. Tried to quit many times but always caved.

I decided that enough was enough when I started to scab vape hits off my friends when mine ran out.  I would go through one vape a week and get incredibly anxious without one. Two months ago something flipped in my brain and I decided to slowly cut down my vape intake. It was tough but for a month I slowly decreased my daily hits and got to the point where I tried to stop all together and it‚Äôs been amazing and my urges to vape have basically vanished this time. The difference being I truly want to quit this time.

The first week was tough and had negative side effects but pushed through and those desires vanished quickly.

I am already seeing some amazing benefits that I wanted to share to hopefully motivate others.

- Reduced brain fog and head feels clear 
- Average resting heart rate is going down
- much lower heart rate on my usual morning walk to get a coffee
- I‚Äôm getting better sleep quality and really vivid dreams, I‚Äôm waking up refreshed 
- increased motivation and desire to improve my life in other ways 
- workout effort improved in the gym 
- I don‚Äôt feel guilty hiding my habit from family and scabbing off friends 
- sense of smell improved 
- taste buds improved 
- many more

- Quick customer service when nearby areas were having network issues, etc.
- Only 5 minutes to set up an account via their app straight from your phone! So no need to visit a branch and take time out of your busy day

1jduu0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jduu0z/2mg_decrease_per_day_taper_plan/,2mg decrease per day taper plan,"I‚Äôve tried it all. Weaning off using Wean Caffeine at 10mg decrease every 3 days from 100mg a day over a month. 

Cold turkey from numerous caffeine levels. Epic failure each time due lethargy, lack of focus, painful migraines and nausea/vomiting. 

I‚Äôm not wasting another week of PTO trying to cold turkey ever again. I work long shifts at work,  so tapering more aggressively isn‚Äôt advisable because I need to be mentally aware and not coasting through the day. 

So my plan is something I haven‚Äôt seen around here in years.

My motivation for doing things this way is to make this as slow and painless as possible. I‚Äôm extremely sensitive to changes in caffeine apparently, so I‚Äôm trying to decrease my dosage from about 206mg per day to 0mg. 

The OP of this original post used caffeine powder from caffeine pills but I‚Äôm not going that route for two reasons. 
1.) I don‚Äôt want to accidentally take too much and OD or something bc I suck at math especially the med math I‚Äôd need to get a dose right. It‚Äôs happened to people believe it or not.

2.) I‚Äôm used to Pepsi as I‚Äôve been drinking the stuff since childhood. Coffee and tea give me bad anxiety. So while I‚Äôd like a no calorie or artificial sweetener free option, they won‚Äôt work me. I know Pepsi isn‚Äôt good for me either but I don‚Äôt want to try to figure out a new baseline level using another caffeinated beverage. 

This should take me until from 3/17/2025 until the end of June if I decrease by 2mg a day. 

My math works out to about approximately 2mg decrease from about .75 ounce per day or approximately 22.2 ml taken out from each Pepsi, removing an additional .75 ounce or 22.2ml each day until I‚Äôm decreasing from a little less than 5 cans all the way into the mini 7.5 ounce cans eventually. 

This isn‚Äôt my original idea. 
I remember an account from 6 years ago of a person decreasing their intake from 1000mg a day down to 150mg a day and then they stopped posting and deleted their account. Their rationale is that they had a busy full time job as a waiter if I‚Äôm not mistaken and a child at home to take care of as well. While also being a college student iirc.

So, let me hear your thoughts. Is my math correct? I‚Äôm open to suggestions for improving my plan!

A can of Pepsi is 12 oz/355ml if I recall
Correctly. So 3.2mg of caffeine per oz for 38mg per can. I know it might be easier to decrease it by an oz per day but I have a feeling my body won‚Äôt be able to register such a small decrease each day and I want to play it even more conservative this time around. I just want to be don‚Äôt with this caffeine garbage and while it may take me longer than I‚Äôd like, at least there‚Äôs a tiny chance to minimize the agony. ",2,1742264891.0,decaf,4,1.0,False

1jdutt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteryWriting/comments/1jdutt7/does_this_sound_like_a_believable_scenario_this/,"Does this sound like a believable scenario? This is all work in progress, FYI. Also FYI, SPOILERS AHEAD!","Our story is set in the present day Minnesota Zoo. Our villain is the boss as well as the detectives client. (FYI, I haven't named any supporting cast members yet) And our victim is one of the zookeepers. The trouble started when the keeper learned that the Boss had been making deals with the Exotic Animal Trade, an international crime syndicate involved in poaching and animal smuggling. The MN Zoo in real life, presents itself as an ally of conservation and animal life. Whether or not that's true in real life, I do not know. But if it was revealed to be working with criminals, it could ruin their reputation and led to disastrous consequences.

Anyway, the boss realized that if the keeper revealed this dirty little secret to the public, he'd be toast. So, he hired an assassin to kill the keeper. The boss was hoping the keeper would die at their house. But the assassin was kept on a leash that was too long. And ended up killing the keeper while they were at work, and the keeper died before they could tell one of their co-workers. Dropped dead with seemingly no explanation. (They were poisoned by cyanide inside the keepers coffee, worked slowly and they never felt a thing for a few hours) Upset by this, the boss kills the assassin to try and cover tracks and hides the body somewhere in the zoo. Anyway, the boss knows that if word of this leaks out, everyone will think the Zoo had something to do with it. So instead of bringing in the police, he decides to create a scapegoat, and this is where the detective comes in.

Long story short, our detective is private investigator who's a member of at least two marginalized groups. The boss's plan is to frame the detective for the murder. And with them being part of at least 2 groups that society often looks down on, and judge unfairly in courts, it would take little effort to convict the detective for murder. But of course, the villain underestimates the detective.",1,1742264873.0,MysteryWriting,0,1.0,False

\--

The morning bustled with energy at the Orc Caf√©'s booth. Breakfast had never been a festival highlight, but now that the caf√© was serving lattes and BLTs, it had become an instant hit.¬†The line only died down when the morning stories began.

A lone figure dressed in all purple stood patiently in line.¬†Her deep purple eyes observed the Orcs and the lone imp hustling to keep up with the endless orders.¬†She smiled, enjoying the sight. Once it was her turn, she stood, looking up at the much larger Orc taking orders.

""Good morning to you, Great Orc Bob,"" the purple figure said, smiling gently.

Bob shivered momentarily as if a cold wind had blown through the booth. Then he smiled at the little woman dressed in all purple, with purple hair and oddly purple eyes. ""Uh, good morning. What can I do for you?""

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a vanilla latte,‚Äù¬†the small woman said.

""Sure thing, name?"" Bob asked.

""Judy,"" the woman said. The crowd had seemed to quiet down.

""Uh, sure,"" Bob turned and yelled, ""Vanilla Latte for Judy!""

Rose shouted back, ""Vanilla latte for Judy, got it."" Rose got to work making the latte.

Judy handed the coins to Bob, who gladly accepted it. As Judy approached the left to await her order, he looked to the next customer.

‚ÄúVanilla Latte for Judy,‚Äù¬†shouted Rick.

Judy raised her hand; she wasn't much taller than the imp, ""That's for me, Rick.""

""Here ya go,"" Rick handed her the latte, but for a moment, he felt a chill.

‚ÄúThank you,¬†Quartermaster¬†Rick,‚Äù Judy said, taking a sip and smiling.¬†‚ÄúAh, excellent. By the way, one of today‚Äôs stories about Song. I thought you would want to hear about your ancestor.‚Äù

Rick was dumbfounded and nodded yes.

Well then, I‚Äôll see you at noon by the fountain,‚Äù Judy said.¬†‚ÄúHave a good morning.‚Äù She sipped her coffee, smiled, and walked away.

Rick could only wave as she disappeared into the crowd.

""Rick!"" Rose shouted, ""Got another order. You okay?""

""Yeah, yeah,"" Rick said and went back to work.

\---

Later that day, it was time for the morning shift to have a break.

""Chief,"" Rick said, ""I'd like to leave for a bit to hear the story of Song.""

Chief Richard smiled, ""Of course, Rick.""

""Who's Song?"" Bob asked.

""Uh, Song is the greatest imp warrior,"" Rick said.

""Really, that's fascinating. Would you like some company,"" Rose asked.

""Yes!"" Rick yelped.

‚ÄúGreatest imp warrior, huh?‚Äù Bob said.¬†‚ÄúSo, imps went to war? With who, the gophers?‚Äù¬†He laughed, earning a sharp glare from Rose.

Rick‚Äôs face turned red with embarrassment.

‚ÄúShut up, Great Orc Bob,‚Äù Rose snarled.

‚ÄúOkay, you two. Rose, Bob likes the little guy. He‚Äôs just messing with him,‚Äù Chief Richard said, stepping between them. ""I think we should all go. Honestly, I would like to know more about them.""

Bob scratched his head. ""Yeah, sorry, Rick. I was just joking around. I'm with Chief; I want to know more, too.""

Rick smiled, ""Thank you, I would be honored if you heard her story.""

The orcs and the imp settled on benches before the stage next to the fountain. The benches were larger than the one for Battleax. The orcs smiled and joked as the crowd gathered around. Bob was impressed at the many different species that had come to hear the story.

Two hooded purple figures approached the stage. The crowd settled down as the two figures climbed up the stairs. Both were small by Orc comparison, but one was smaller than the other. They stood in the middle of the stage and pulled back their cloak. One figure was an imp whose fur had a hint of purple. The other was Judy.

Judy raised her hands.¬†‚ÄúAttention, everyone. Today, we will hear the story of Song of the Ong clan, the ghost, the savior, and the warrior. Her tale will be told by Song‚Äôs direct descendant, Yong.‚Äù¬†Judy¬†bowed her head and left the stage.

Judy approached the orcs and Rick. ‚ÄúRick, may I sit with you and Rose for the story?‚Äù

Rick glanced at Rose, who looked just as surprised. ‚ÄúSure, please.‚Äù

""Thank you,"" Judy sat between Rick and Bob.

Yong raised her hands. ""Today, we will tell the story of my grandmother, who lived many generations ago. It is the Song of the Ong clan, the runt.""

\---

Song stood beside her brother Zong, the youngest of the Ong clan. Imps named their children alphabetically after their clan; it was their way of practicing their ABCs. When Zong was born, Mother Ong declared she was done having children. The siblings cheered, relieved they wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with names like AAong or Aong, which would have been a nightmare to keep straight.

Song didn't like that her youngest brother was twice her size. She was the smallest of the Ong clan. They called her runt. She hated it. She also hated being her clan's smallest, slowest, and weakest. The clan tried to vote her out, but Mother Ong wouldn't allow it.

The men came in the middle of the night. The clan had never been attacked by humans before. They tried to fight back, but the men had armor and weapons beyond the rocks and sticks that the Ong clan had. Plus, the men had a mountain troll. Song had never seen a troll before. When it was over, Song was alone. No one knows if it was that she was too small to notice or too small to enslave for the mines. What we do know is that leaving her was a mistake.

Song tracked the humans and her clan for days. She ate bugs and roots. Thankfully, the humans were not in a hurry and stayed on the main roads. Any humans they passed weren't concerned about the imps in chains. Enslaving what was considered a lesser race was common practice in this area at that time.

The clan was taken to a coal mine dug into a mountain. They were put to work immediately. Song stayed at the perimeter of the mine watching. Not only was her clan there, but there were other imp clans, a few dwarves, trolls, a few orcs, a single elf, and humans! Song was surprised to see humans shackled like the rest. Even the mountain troll she had seen attacking her village was shackled. She wondered why it didn't snap the iron chains and attack, but it seemed docile like many others.

Song waited and watched. She stole food from the captors, who blamed it on rats. Soon, she found out who the leader was. He was an imposing human named Kevin. She had heard some of the guards shouting his name. She watched Kevin closely. She made a point of stealing more food from him.

Months later, Song sat in the mountains, watching the camp from above. She had several small camps around the mine so the men wouldn't notice her. Movement caught her attention. A jolt of fear shot through her when she saw the snake. It was one of the poisonous ones they were warned to avoid. Thankfully, it wasn't interested in her.

She watched as the snake hunted a small rodent. Song felt sorry for the small thing. She knew what it was like to be that small. The snake slowly stalked its prey, and then it struck. Song's heart jumped, knowing that the little rodent was dead, but instead, she saw the snake fly back, and the rodent got away. Song couldn't believe what she saw.

Song closely watched the rodents and snakes any night she slept in the mountains. One night, she saw it again. This time, she was more prepared and saw that the rodent jumped and twisted in the air when the snake struck. While the rodent was twisting, it kicked the snake away. An idea sparked in her mind.

Song began to train. She started by jumping. Soon, she could jump and twist. After a few weeks, she could jump, twist, and kick. She was getting the hang of imitating the rodent she had watched. Unfortunately, her jumping was noticed.

The attack was swift, and Song was taken by surprise. The only thing that saved her was she was ready to spring into another jump. The blow spun her in mid-air, and she landed hard but more or less on her feet. The large cat hissed as it prepared for another attack.

The cat jumped, but Song was ready this time. She jumped and twisted away from the creature. She kicked out, striking it hard in the head. The cat hit the ground hard, and Song landed on her feet. She was breathing hard, and her vision was blurred.

The cat roared again and jumped. Song also jumped, but this time, she could aim her feet better and strike the cat in the head. It hit the ground hard again. This time, Song was ready. She jumped, somersaulting over the cat while extending her claws. She dug her sharp nails into the cat's side, creating large gashes. The cat screeched out in pain.

It again tried to turn for another jump, but Song was ready. She flipped over the cat again, slicing its neck and back with her claws. The large cat screeched again, but it was slowing down.

The cat stood once more while Song stared it down. It attempted a step forward but failed and collapsed. Song grabbed the sharp stick she had kept with her and stabbed the large cat deep into its heart.

Breathing heavily, she stood over her slain opponent. There was no time to celebrate; torches flickered in the distance, and human voices drew near. Her heart pounding, Song bolted into the tall grass, crouching low as she watched.

""Look at that!"" a man said. ""I thought these things didn't have predators.""

""They don't,"" Kevin said, ""whatever did this was strong.""

""It looks fresh,"" Another man said.

The men became quiet. Song could hear them shuffling around the body of the large cat.

""I don't see anything,"" a man said.

""Doesn't matter. Nothing comes near the mines."" Kevin said. ""Well, looks like fresh meat is on the menu tonight.""

The men laughed and cheered as they took the cat with them.

Song waited until she knew they were long gone. Her vision had cleared except for her left eye. She touched her face and found blood on her hands. She rushed to a small pool nearby.

With the moons now in full bloom, she could see clearly. She had four claw marks down her brow and across her cheek. She washed her wounds and her left eye. Her vision became clear once the blood was gone. She looked at her reflection carefully. The wound was deep, but thankfully, it missed her eye. She looked savage. She felt savage.

It was time. She had a plan to get her clan back.

He was grinning and even looked excited to see me, I didn't even know he went to the same university as me since I moved schools during COVID and hadn't seen him since. In high school this guy was a huge jerk and for some reason people worshipped the ground he walked on, and he used this power to do whatever he wanted.. including picking on me. He would regularly pick on me and compare me to fugly animated characters, make fun of my hair ( which was very short and curly), say I look like a boy, and would even call me fat ( looking back I really wasn't, it was just baby weight that I would go on to quickly lose). I don't even think I did anything to provoke him and yet I was one of the main targets. 

Despite our brutal history he still decided to approach me and the first thing he said was "" you look so different, wow you really grew into yourself holy"" in such a genuine way but for split second I waited for the mean comment to follow up, but there was none. I thanked him and he made small talk with me but I barely listened I was hung up on the fact he was here talking to me, complimenting me when 5 years ago he would not hesitate to insult me. The craziest part was he looked the exact same just more mature in the face, he was still short and stocky with a stupid voice- which seemed to piss me off even more so I left quickly but the anger remained

 An hour ago he followed me on Instagram and shot me a DM asking to get coffee together and properly catch up, which has me even more pissed. Why does he think he has the right to ask to see me when he caused so much damage, yes I am less ugly now but look at my profile I still feel ugly and I am struggling partially due to him. I am so mad that he still has the confidence to even approach me despite our history and I'm even more mad he's asked to hangout when he would regularly tell me no guy would want me.

The worst part is, I know holding onto this anger isn‚Äôt good for me. But how do you not feel bitter? How do you not resent the fact that these guys tore down your self-esteem for fun and then get to casually reappear like they‚Äôre old friends? Like, does he even remember the things he said? Does he feel bad? Is he doing it because no girls are interested in him ( that's what my friend who is mutuals with his friends said, apparently he's got no game which is ironic for a guy who would always say he's ""5'6 with the personality of someone 6'5"".

I know deep down that carrying this anger only keeps me tied to the past, but it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs hard not to wonder how much easier my life would‚Äôve been if people like him hadn‚Äôt chipped away at my confidence when I was just a kid.

We work at a grocery store he works at the deli I work at the coffee shop. He kept insisting on giving me his number til I finally decided I wanted it. 
I had just started going through a breakup which I‚Äôve been very transparent about where I‚Äôm at. He was being super sweet and supportive after we started texting. We had been flirting and he comes by my cafe sometimes to bring me treats (one time he brought me surprise ice cream), and every shift we work together on his last break he‚Äôll come ask how my day is and give me some kinda cute compliment. He gives me old timey nick names in our texts like suga and honey and we‚Äôve learned that we share a lot of similar goals and values ie having a family, valuing spirituality, sobriety, (we‚Äôre both more newly sober this last year), health, etc. the weird thing is that I‚Äôm not one to usually go for Tauruses? 
I‚Äôm an Aquarius sun, but I have a Scorpio moon, and both Pisces and Scorpio stellium. Idk his placements yet‚Äî I guess not trying to go there too soon lmao. 
Oh fast foreward we went on a pretty hike last week and made out on the top of the mountain‚Ä¶ and today I went over to his place and we cuddled/had sexy fun/he cooked me dinner and we cuddled more and watched a movie for a bit til we needed to part ways. 
Idk. I‚Äôm probably over thinking. I‚Äôm trying to take things slow and keep focusing on me while making sure to let him know I‚Äôm interested in him in a non smothering way.
He mentioned he‚Äôs attracted to my confidence and how I‚Äôm putting myself first and I‚Äôm attracted to him for the same things.
Do you think he‚Äôs really into me or do u think he just wants some sexy fun? Like we haven‚Äôt known each other that long but our connect feels very natural and we both seem to be very attracted to each other. Idk. I‚Äôm trying to take things slow and not let my Scorpio side get too excited / obsessive haha but it feels nice and I feel like he likes me and it feels healthy on my side.

1jduq2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1jduq2b/i_played_ever_dark_age_including_some_doubledark/,"I played ever dark age, including some double-dark ages. Here's what I think.","tldr: I like dark ages but maybe needs a more consistent design pass (esp science dark ages) - some are hard to unlock without being really behind while others are super easy to unlock without losing too much  
best overall design: dark military exploration  
worst overall design: dark science modern

I wanted to try out every single dark age, including doing double-dark ages (as in, pick dark age in exploration and modern). They might not be the most optimal civ-leader combos as I had other considerations (I wanted to play Ada and Carthage as they were just released, for e.g.) - just wanted to see how the mechanics would play out..

I'll try to give brief explanations of the dark age mechanics for those completely unfamiliar - if you have specific questions ask me in the comments. Dark ages are basically a legacy option when you transition into exploration and modern, without meeting the first milestone in any of the legacy paths in the prior age. Example - building less than 2 wonders in antiquity gives you the option of a cultural dark age in exploration. When you pick one, you cannot pick any other legacy option, including other dark and golden ages, attribute points, etc. except for change capital

Disclaimer: I played on Sovereign as I find it the most fun difficulty currently.

# First run- dark eco exploration; Ada - Rome - Spain - Great Britain

Dark eco exploration - every 2 levels on your naval commander grants you a settle action on that commander (basically Legatus on naval), settlers cost more to train  
**Unlocking it:** this dark age is really hard to intentionally get - I can see it being an interesting strategy to settle locations focusing a certain terrain type (at the expense of more resources), but if the intention is for this to help players who are behind on resources, I think the first milestone is too easy to get - slotting 7 resources - so players have to be reallly really behind to not get this (esp because you automatically slot valid resources when a settle claims the tile. Even harder if you're trying to do it on purpose (i.e. youre not actually that behind) as it's for e.g. easy to ""not build wonders"" or ""not pick masteries/narratives that give you codices"" even if you're ahead.  
**Strong/Weak?** It's quite good - if you keep a constant xp stream to two or three naval commanders by independent people (IP) hopping (and eventually, taking AI cities by the coast), I find the settling frequency quite in line with settlement limit increases (through tech/civics), and - you're already at pretty good locations where you got xp (from clearing IPs). It also makes a lot of sense for getting strong treasure fleet settles faster than anyone else as you dont have to build and move settlers - so the penalty doesn't even matter. The only downside is you can't do settles away from coast/navigable rivers  
**Fun?:** Yes, esp with Spain (I got suppppper lucky with my first conquistador, iykyk); I can see Chola being a fun combo as well.

# Second run - dark culture exploration into dark science modern; Catherine - Han- Shawnee - Russia

Dark culture exploration - missionaries get +1 move and +1 charge, -3 happiness in all settles after founding a religion; -6 in settles not following your religion;  
**Unlocking it:** Pretty easy - just don't build more than 1 wonder (probably just your civs associated wonder or gate of all nations). I picked Han so I could focus entirely on building a humongous great-wall that would basically propel my culture into perpetuity, and wonders would only get in the way, tbh.  
**Strong/Weak?** Above average - I played this combo (i.e. with Shawnee) because I wanted to see what would happen if I got 100% conversion (spoilers, you only get one more founder belief, and you can't even golden age both in modern). I did get pretty good early yields on my religion and so many relics quickly, but I think it was the big great wall + serpents mound + forbidden city that basically won me the game  
**Fun?:** yes contingent on you liking religion, which is a pretty underbaked mechanic atm - I thought it was ok to try one time.

Dark science modern - unlocks flight with combustion, air units cost more to train  
**Unlocking it:** this one actually sucks hard - it's very hard to not accidentally get this because it requires a lot of calculation or not placing any specialists at all (also hard, and suboptimal), and you literally cannot get a single tile with >40 yield.  
**Strong/Weak?** Pretty weak, it basically let's you start aerodrome/trans-oceanic flight earlier, that's it. I suppose unlocking airplanes is good, but the penalty makes it hard to use anyway  
**Fun?:** Not really, but also I may have been so ahead by modern I don't feel the science struggle very much.

# Third run - dark military exploration into dark eco; Napoleon Emeperor - Khmer - Mongolia - Prussia

Dark military exploration - lose all your settlements except your capital (your existing or the one you click change capital to), lose all your existing armies and army commanders (fyi, you keep independent units as much as your settles still!), start with three army commanders packed with cavalry and siege  
**Unlocking it:** since you're going to lose everything but your capital, this is quite OK to unlock, the plan for me was simply get a couple of food heavy towns to boost my super capital (why I picked Khmer), which spammed wonders and specialists to make sure I could start on slightly better culture/science/gold in exploration  
**Strong/Weak?** Strong but situational (thats good design I think!) - if you have juicy targets nearby, especially strong cities with horses, this snowballs much faster. It's harder to use it for, ironically, distant land captures for the military golden age. You'll also realize you don't have that much influence for war support (because you'll at max have one monument and villa to start) right from the get go, so the first few picks count for a lot, and previous age bad relationships are good (why I picked napoleon). The very obvious pick for this is mongols. I can see normans as a potentially good one for doing a distant lands version of the strat.  
**Fun?:** of course (unless you hate war and only like optimal settles where you can plan everything - i.e. not ai/other people settles) I would say it kind of trivializes the antiquity age (though Id argue if you play a super capital/lose territory to other plays actually this is OK)

Dark eco modern - 100% Production and Gold towards building or purchasing Rail Stations and Ports as well as +1 Resource Capacity in all settlements, but -25% Culture;

**Unlocking it:** easy - don't get treasure fleet points (or if you did mongolia dark military, don't even conquer/settle outside of your homelands!), very viable  
**Strong/Weak?** strong - the downside is somewhat harsh but for eco victory types this just makes it that much faster. The fact that there is a viable way of not being behind to unlock it (i.e. don't play treasure fleets) makes it that much stronger (tea and chocolate are the only factory resources you aren't going to get without distant lands), but I found enough coffee/cotton/citrus/quinine/fish/kaolin to not care too much. Also, with prussia, this double dark age strat was more effective because I can trade for more resources even though everyone hates me/is at war! (+ they get railroad bonuses)  
**Fun?:** it's fun if you like ""speed-running"" type gameplay - it basically made eco victory ""win more/faster"" and was very smooth. I do, so this was fun for me.

# Fourth run - dark science exploration into dark military modern; Augustus - Carthage - Chola - Mughal

Dark science exploration - Dark Age: Gain a random technology boost every five turns, but -50% Science.

**Unlocking it:** relatively OK  - you have to intentionally not pick tech masteries that give codices, which for the most part most of the masteries I want don't involve codices anyway  
**Strong/Weak?** this one just sucks, or I'm not sure how to play around it enough. It's like a weaker civ 6 babylon? I guess the idea is you can randomly get techs you want faster, (or you can purposely play into them), but you are somewhat incentivized to neglect science? I suppose if you have a flexible plan - like if you get wharf early you'll go distant lands faster, if you get machinery maybe you'll do this, etc.  
**Fun?:** kind of? not really? might need a design pass? maybe if you like random?; My plan ended up being to neglect science in favor of spamming units and commanders (why I picked chola) to set up for my military dark age in modern (so because I had no science, I could spam the less upgraded unit anyway, though im not sure if it costs less), so it worked out.

Dark military modern - Dark Age: Gain two levels on all Commanders and new Commanders start out with two levels, but +25% Production cost for all military units.

**Unlocking it:** pretty easy - just don't settle too much distant lands and definitely don't convert them to your religion  
**Strong/Weak?** strong with setup - I basically had enough settle limit and enough commanders that i could potentially just declare multiple wars and take every city I needed instantly once I hit an ideology - i couldnt because I didnt set up enough denounces early to mass declare formal wars - I actually wanted to do Great Britain (because of my massive setup navy in exploration -> Revenge) but there's a bug so I went for Mughal because I wanted to *buy* the manhattan project (also, fitting because the overused quote is from the bhagavad gita, not exactly mughal but on the subcontinent I suppose)  
**Fun?:** yes, executing this plan was very fun

# Fifth run - dark modern culture; Friedrich Baroque - Egypt  - Ming - Buganda

Dark culture modern - Dark Age: +1 Movement and +50% Excavation Speed for Explorers, but -50% Influence.

**Unlocking it:** easy - ignore religion, very viable to get culture from other sources (why I chose ming)  
**Strong/Weak?** mixed? I think with the slightly reworked modern cultural victory, it actually does make a difference that your explorer ""gets there first"", but to me it's more about luck and how many explorers you can buy rather than movement, so maybe this needs a slight rework (e.g. unlock free/cheaper explorers after building a wonder or something), the influence penalty is pretty painful, esp when compared to the dark eco modern (-25% culture is much less painful)  
**Fun?:** \~eh, because we get less explorers now, and because you can get artifacts through other means, you don't interact with it much, so it's not that fun. Also, I should probably be using railroads more to shift explorers... (my own fault) I picked friedrich - buganda partially to get the artifacts even faster (by conquest, and pillaging for culture)

# Closing thoughts

I *think* the devs tried to design dark ages such that it helps players in weaker positions rubber-band into a golden age for the same-type legacy path - I think this vision was met for all but the science exploration dark age. However, culture, military and eco modern dark ages are really easy to get while *not* behind (ignore religion or distant lands, not that much penalty), so it's a bit weird because it becomes a powerful *all-in* option for a modern victory rather than a Im behind and need to catch up mechanic. (maybe what needs to change is to make those paths stronger, like treasure fleets giving crap-tons of gold and or resources) That said, you do lose out on all the points you did get if you pick it, so the intention is still for you to be behind to pick it. But also, some of them are really fun and I want to pick it even though Im ahead? The science ones are also not as creative or well designed as I think they can be. Also, because you lose all your other points and take a dark-age penalty, it's probably not that good (but of course, you can't make it better than a golden age, otherwise what's the point). I think maybe some of these problems would be addressed by a smarter/more difficult AI forcing me to really consider dark ages in that setting (I don't play on deity so that's partly it)
