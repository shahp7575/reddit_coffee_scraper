""This early?"" I asked, shifting my gaze from the stars above to his face as I lay on the grass field behind the school. The cool grass tickled my bare arms, and I could hear crickets chirping somewhere in the darkness.

""Early? It's past midnight, princess. You better get some sleep, don't want you looking like a panda in Adam's birthday photos tomorrow,"" he said as he stood up, brushing grass off his jeans and smoothing his faded Guns N' Roses t-shirt, the one with the small hole near the shoulder that he refused to throw away.

""You think I look like a panda?"" I pouted, taking his outstretched hand. His hands were warm and slightly rough from his summer gig, playing drums in a band that he and his friends made in freshman year.

""Yes, you're my cute little panda. Now get your ass up,"" he said, pulling me to my feet with that familiar grin that I like.

We walked toward my house, our footsteps echoing on the pavement. The night air smelled like cut grass and Mrs. Henderson's jasmine that climbed over her fence. I glanced at him as we walked, him with his messy golden hair catching the light from each streetlamp we passed.

""Ray‚Ä¶?""

He turned to look at me, eyebrows raised in that questioning way.

""Do you ever think about‚Ä¶ what if I'm not your soulmate?"" The words came out before I could stop them, and I immediately looked down at the cracked sidewalk.

""What kind of stupid question is that?"" he chuckled. ""They say you'll know when you meet your soulmate. You can feel it in your skin, your heart, your pulse, in your very soul‚Ä¶ and with you, I feel it, Eve. When you laugh at my terrible jokes, when you steal my hoodies and pretend you don't know where they went, I know for a fact we are each other's soulmate.""

I looked up to find him watching me with those blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean on a clear day.

""What if we aren't? There are people who love each other, who end up finding out they aren't‚Ä¶ What if we won't grow old together? What if we're stuck as eighte-""

""Ahhh, my sweet overthinker,"" he said, slipping his arm around my shoulder and pulling me closer as we walked. His body was warm against the cool September air, and I could smell his cologne, that cheap drugstore brand he'd worn since sophomore year because I'd mentioned I liked it once.

""Then we'll stay young forever. Watch the seasons change and the world get old. Annoy people with our stories about the 'good old days' like Mr. Brooks does at the corner store.""

I couldn't help but laugh at that image.

""What if one of us meets our soulmate during this time?""

The question hung between us. He was quiet for a moment, and I could tell he was thinking carefully about his answer.

""Eve.""

He stopped walking, his voice softer now. We were standing under the same streetlight we'd passed countless times, the one with the small crack in the glass that made interesting shadows on the ground. This was where he'd first told me he loved me last spring.

""We may or may not be soulmates, but what I feel for you is real. I want you to know that, and no one can say otherwise. What we have isn't some cosmic accident. It's choice, Eve. Every day, I choose you. And I'll never leave you for a soulmate I barely know. You've been here with me through everything, all my ups and downs, all my highs and lows.""

He cupped my face with both hands, his thumbs gentle against my cheeks. His hands were slightly cold from the night air, but his touch made me feel warm all over.

""I'll never leave you. Even if you decide to leave me.""

Tears started to blur my vision, making his face look soft around the edges.

""It's the same thing,"" I whispered.

""What?"" He looked confused.

I wiped my eyes. ""Ups and downs, highs and lows‚Ä¶ they're the same thing.""

He threw his head back and laughed, that genuine sound that always made my heart skip.

""Oh my God, all that romantic speech, and that's what you catch?"" he said, pulling me into a tight hug that smelled like his cologne and something that was just Ray.

I buried my face against his chest, feeling his heartbeat through his t-shirt. It was beating faster than usual, and I realised this conversation had affected him too.

He knows I'm an overthinker. He knows I don't like crying in front of people. He knows I like to be hugged when I'm sad. He knows I calm down when he plays with my hair, which he was doing now, his fingers gentle as they worked through the tangles.

He knows me better than I know myself sometimes.

""But hey, it's true I'll still be here, young and eighteen forever‚Ä¶""

I tilted my head back to look at him the person who made even my worst days bearable.

""...while you grow old and lose all your teeth and be like, 'Oh my God, is that you, Raymond? My eyesight hasn't been so good lately,'"" he said in a shaky old-lady voice, hunching his shoulders dramatically.

""Stop it, Ray,"" I said, smacking his shoulder while trying not to laugh. He pulled me closer, and I could feel him shaking with laughter.

""I love you, Ray,"" I said, looking up at him and meaning every word.

He looked down at me, and for a moment, everything else seemed to fade away: the distant sound of cars, the wind in the trees, everything.

""I love you too, Eve,"" he said, brushing a piece of hair away from my face. ""More than I thought it was possible to love someone.""

Under the streetlight, his hair looked like a halo, and his eyes seemed to reflect the light.

""Can I kiss you?""

""Of course,"" I breathed.

His hands found my waist, and he kissed me softly, like he had all the time in the world. He's always been gentle with me, always seemed to know exactly what I needed without me having to say anything.

I put my hands on his chest, feeling the solid warmth of him, the steady heartbeat that proved this wasn't just a dream. 

We stood there under our streetlight, holding each other in the cool September night. I could feel the stars watching us from above, and the moon watching as with quiet jealousy, cause her son is not with her, when I have mine right here by my side.

When we finally broke apart, his hands stayed on my waist, and he looked at me with those eyes that always seemed to see right through me.

It made me want to keep kissing him forever. Made me want to stay in this moment and never leave.



We walked to my house hand in hand, talking about tomorrow's plans.

""So what should we get Adam for his birthday?"" I asked.

""I've already bought Knicks merchandise,"" he said proudly.

I rolled my eyes. ""That's what you gave him last year. And the year before that.""

""But he likes the Knicks,"" he shrugged. ""Have you seen his room? It's covered in posters.""

""We should get him something else too. Something more personal.""

""He likes poetry, maybe a book?""

""Do you happen to know his favourite poet?"" I asked, already knowing he didn't.

""You know I don't,"" he said, rolling his eyes. ""That's your thing, not mine.""

We'd reached my house. The porch light was on, casting shadows across the front yard where my mom's roses were still blooming.

""Let's go to that bookstore on five tomorrow before Adam's party? The one with the cat in the window?""

""Okay, my lady. Your wish is my command,"" he said with an exaggerated bow that made me giggle.

""Now go get some sleep, princess.""

""Yes, my king,"" I said, giving him a curtsy back.

As I turned toward the house, I remembered something and spun back around.

""What time will you pick me up tomorrow?""

""I'll be here by 4,"" he said, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. ""We'll get coffee first, then the bookstore, then Adam's.""

""Call me when you get home,"" I said, standing on my tiptoes to give him a quick kiss.

""I will,"" he promised.

""Good night, Eve.""

""Good night, Ray."" I started toward the door, then paused. ""Oh, and please don't wear that ugly green blazer tomorrow.""

""Hey! My blazer isn't ugly, it's vintage,"" he protested, putting his hand over his heart like I'd wounded him. ""But what can I say‚Äîmy girlfriend has no fashion sense.""

I rolled my eyes, trying not to smile. ""Good night, you fashion disaster.""

He stayed on the sidewalk until I got inside and went upstairs to my room. When I looked out my window, he was still there under the streetlight. I waved, and only then did he head home, probably humming some classic rock song.

I flopped onto my bed without changing clothes, staring up at the glow-in-the-dark stars we'd put on my ceiling years ago during a sleepover that turned into an astronomy lesson.

1mk7oug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1mk7oug/indian_mom_visiting_me_in_the_uk_soon_emotionally/,Indian mom visiting me in the UK soon ‚Äî emotionally exhausted & torn between guilt and protecting my peace,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a 29F Indian woman currently living in the UK. I‚Äôve been here for the past 4 years and have built a peaceful life, including a loving relationship with my partner, whom I met 3 years back, he is Russian. I recently came back to India for 10 days to help my mom (51F, single parent) pack and travel to the UK for her first-ever international trip. But these 8 days with her have left me emotionally drained and deeply confused.

My mother raised me and my younger sister alone after my father passed when I was 3. I deeply respect the struggles she went through. She worked relentlessly and gave us a decent education. But she was also highly controlling and emotionally abusive throughout my childhood ‚Äî shouting, guilt-tripping, forbidding me from having friends, obsessing over my grades so she could boast to others. I didn‚Äôt have a normal childhood ‚Äî I took on responsibilities far too early.

This trip back home has opened my eyes. Here are a few examples from just this week:

‚Ä¢	The Coffee Incident: I like to drink my morning coffee slowly. One morning I had just woken up and was sipping it when she started doing household chores. She‚Äôs been unwell (viral infection) and I calmly asked her to rest, saying I‚Äôd do the cleaning right after I finish my coffee. She snapped, saying things like ‚ÄúYou woke up late,‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I leave it to you, it won‚Äôt get done till 1pm,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou guys need one hour to finish coffee, nothing ever gets done.‚Äù I felt so bad, I poured the rest of my coffee down the sink and opened my laptop to start work early ‚Äî just to escape.

‚Ä¢	The Temple Guilt Trip: She wanted to go to a temple early morning (5 AM), even though I work from home 1 PM‚Äì11 PM with no breaks. I explained gently that I need sleep and am doing chores and caring for her while she‚Äôs unwell. She got offended, called me an atheist, and even told relatives on the phone, loud enough for me to hear, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an atheist in the house.‚Äù The next morning she missed the alarm (due to medication), woke late, and demanded we go now ‚Äî during heavy Mumbai monsoon and just before my work shift. When I said no, she lashed out again: ‚ÄúThis is what happens when you live with a white guy‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve become westernised.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	Bedroom Demands: She knows I‚Äôve lived with my partner for 2 years ‚Äî she never objected when we travelled abroad or lived together. But now, just two days before we fly to the UK together, she suddenly says she expects us to sleep in separate bedrooms while she‚Äôs visiting because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not married yet‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs against Indian culture.‚Äù My partner ‚Äî bless him ‚Äî has agreed to it just to keep the peace, but he‚Äôs also advising me not to bring her after how she‚Äôs treated me. And honestly? I agree with him.

She‚Äôs said things like: ‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI regret sending you abroad ‚Äî I thought you‚Äôd come back, not stay there forever with a boyfriend.‚Äù ‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou‚Äôve changed, you don‚Äôt believe in God anymore.‚Äù ‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never understand what I went through raising you girls alone.‚Äù

And the thing is ‚Äî I do understand. She lost her husband young, lives alone, is going through menopause, has no emotional support, and possibly has unresolved trauma. But‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt give her the right to emotionally abuse me and shame me for the life I‚Äôve created.

I‚Äôm exhausted.

I‚Äôve: ‚Ä¢	Applied for her UK visa ‚Ä¢	Paid for her international flights ‚Ä¢	Travelled to India just to help her pack ‚Ä¢	Cared for her while she‚Äôs been unwell

And yet‚Ä¶ all I get is guilt, control, emotional attacks, and disrespect for my partner and my values.

Now I‚Äôm stuck: ‚Ä¢	If I don‚Äôt take her to the UK, I‚Äôll be guilt-tripped and shamed for ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù her forever ‚Ä¢	If I do take her, I‚Äôm terrified of what she‚Äôll say or do once she‚Äôs in our home ‚Ä¢	She may behave well in front of my partner and then attack me emotionally when we‚Äôre alone ‚Äî which has been her pattern for years

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do I set boundaries with someone who sees any independence as betrayal? How do I protect my peace without drowning in guilt?

I want to believe I can break the cycle ‚Äî but right now, I feel stuck and small and so, so tired. I also considering to start therapy soon because I am scared of subconsciously inheriting such toxic behaviour and would like to protect my relationship with my partner.

Any advice or support is appreciated.

I put my hands on his chest, feeling the solid warmth of him, the steady heartbeat that proved this wasn't just a dream. 

We stood there under our streetlight, holding each other in the cool September night. I could feel the stars watching us from above, and the moon watching as with quiet jealousy, cause her son is not with her, when I have mine right here by my side.

When we finally broke apart, his hands stayed on my waist, and he looked at me with those eyes that always seemed to see right through me.

It made me want to keep kissing him forever. Made me want to stay in this moment and never leave.



We walked to my house hand in hand, talking about tomorrow's plans.

""So what should we get Adam for his birthday?"" I asked.

""I've already bought Knicks merchandise,"" he said proudly.

I rolled my eyes. ""That's what you gave him last year. And the year before that.""

""But he likes the Knicks,"" he shrugged. ""Have you seen his room? It's covered in posters.""

""We should get him something else too. Something more personal.""

""He likes poetry, maybe a book?""

""Do you happen to know his favourite poet?"" I asked, already knowing he didn't.

""You know I don't,"" he said, rolling his eyes. ""That's your thing, not mine.""

We'd reached my house. The porch light was on, casting shadows across the front yard where my mom's roses were still blooming.

""Let's go to that bookstore on five tomorrow before Adam's party? The one with the cat in the window?""

""Okay, my lady. Your wish is my command,"" he said with an exaggerated bow that made me giggle.

""Now go get some sleep, princess.""

""Yes, my king,"" I said, giving him a curtsy back.

As I turned toward the house, I remembered something and spun back around.

""What time will you pick me up tomorrow?""

""I'll be here by 4,"" he said, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. ""We'll get coffee first, then the bookstore, then Adam's.""

""Call me when you get home,"" I said, standing on my tiptoes to give him a quick kiss.

""I will,"" he promised.

""Good night, Eve.""

""Good night, Ray."" I started toward the door, then paused. ""Oh, and please don't wear that ugly green blazer tomorrow.""

""Hey! My blazer isn't ugly, it's vintage,"" he protested, putting his hand over his heart like I'd wounded him. ""But what can I say‚Äîmy girlfriend has no fashion sense.""

I rolled my eyes, trying not to smile. ""Good night, you fashion disaster.""

He stayed on the sidewalk until I got inside and went upstairs to my room. When I looked out my window, he was still there under the streetlight. I waved, and only then did he head home, probably humming some classic rock song.

I flopped onto my bed without changing clothes, staring up at the glow-in-the-dark stars we'd put on my ceiling years ago during a sleepover that turned into an astronomy lesson.

""This early?"" I asked, shifting my gaze from the stars above to his face as I lay on the grass field behind the school. The cool grass tickled my bare arms, and I could hear crickets chirping somewhere in the darkness.

""Early? It's past midnight, princess. You better get some sleep, don't want you looking like a panda in Adam's birthday photos tomorrow,"" he said as he stood up, brushing grass off his jeans and smoothing his faded Guns N' Roses t-shirt, the one with the small hole near the shoulder that he refused to throw away.

""You think I look like a panda?"" I pouted, taking his outstretched hand. His hands were warm and slightly rough from his summer gig, playing drums in a band that he and his friends made in freshman year.

""Yes, you're my cute little panda. Now get your ass up,"" he said, pulling me to my feet with that familiar grin that I like.

We walked toward my house, our footsteps echoing on the pavement. The night air smelled like cut grass and Mrs. Henderson's jasmine that climbed over her fence. I glanced at him as we walked, him with his messy golden hair catching the light from each streetlamp we passed.

""Ray‚Ä¶?""

He turned to look at me, eyebrows raised in that questioning way.

""Do you ever think about‚Ä¶ what if I'm not your soulmate?"" The words came out before I could stop them, and I immediately looked down at the cracked sidewalk.

""What kind of stupid question is that?"" he chuckled. ""They say you'll know when you meet your soulmate. You can feel it in your skin, your heart, your pulse, in your very soul‚Ä¶ and with you, I feel it, Eve. When you laugh at my terrible jokes, when you steal my hoodies and pretend you don't know where they went, I know for a fact we are each other's soulmate.""

I looked up to find him watching me with those blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean on a clear day.

""What if we aren't? There are people who love each other, who end up finding out they aren't‚Ä¶ What if we won't grow old together? What if we're stuck as eighte-""

""Ahhh, my sweet overthinker,"" he said, slipping his arm around my shoulder and pulling me closer as we walked. His body was warm against the cool September air, and I could smell his cologne, that cheap drugstore brand he'd worn since sophomore year because I'd mentioned I liked it once.

""Then we'll stay young forever. Watch the seasons change and the world get old. Annoy people with our stories about the 'good old days' like Mr. Brooks does at the corner store.""

I couldn't help but laugh at that image.

""What if one of us meets our soulmate during this time?""

The question hung between us. He was quiet for a moment, and I could tell he was thinking carefully about his answer.

""Eve.""

He stopped walking, his voice softer now. We were standing under the same streetlight we'd passed countless times, the one with the small crack in the glass that made interesting shadows on the ground. This was where he'd first told me he loved me last spring.

""We may or may not be soulmates, but what I feel for you is real. I want you to know that, and no one can say otherwise. What we have isn't some cosmic accident. It's choice, Eve. Every day, I choose you. And I'll never leave you for a soulmate I barely know. You've been here with me through everything, all my ups and downs, all my highs and lows.""

He cupped my face with both hands, his thumbs gentle against my cheeks. His hands were slightly cold from the night air, but his touch made me feel warm all over.

""I'll never leave you. Even if you decide to leave me.""

Tears started to blur my vision, making his face look soft around the edges.

""It's the same thing,"" I whispered.

""What?"" He looked confused.

I wiped my eyes. ""Ups and downs, highs and lows‚Ä¶ they're the same thing.""

He threw his head back and laughed, that genuine sound that always made my heart skip.

""Oh my God, all that romantic speech, and that's what you catch?"" he said, pulling me into a tight hug that smelled like his cologne and something that was just Ray.

I buried my face against his chest, feeling his heartbeat through his t-shirt. It was beating faster than usual, and I realised this conversation had affected him too.

He knows I'm an overthinker. He knows I don't like crying in front of people. He knows I like to be hugged when I'm sad. He knows I calm down when he plays with my hair, which he was doing now, his fingers gentle as they worked through the tangles.

He knows me better than I know myself sometimes.

""But hey, it's true I'll still be here, young and eighteen forever‚Ä¶""

I tilted my head back to look at him the person who made even my worst days bearable.

""...while you grow old and lose all your teeth and be like, 'Oh my God, is that you, Raymond? My eyesight hasn't been so good lately,'"" he said in a shaky old-lady voice, hunching his shoulders dramatically.

""Stop it, Ray,"" I said, smacking his shoulder while trying not to laugh. He pulled me closer, and I could feel him shaking with laughter.

""I love you, Ray,"" I said, looking up at him and meaning every word.

He looked down at me, and for a moment, everything else seemed to fade away: the distant sound of cars, the wind in the trees, everything.

""I love you too, Eve,"" he said, brushing a piece of hair away from my face. ""More than I thought it was possible to love someone.""

Under the streetlight, his hair looked like a halo, and his eyes seemed to reflect the light.

""Can I kiss you?""

""Of course,"" I breathed.

His hands found my waist, and he kissed me softly, like he had all the time in the world. He's always been gentle with me, always seemed to know exactly what I needed without me having to say anything.

I put my hands on his chest, feeling the solid warmth of him, the steady heartbeat that proved this wasn't just a dream.

So last fall I matched with a girl on Hinge, we talked a bit, but she ultimately fell off the face of the earth. Didn't respond further. I assumed I got ghosted and moved on. 

Fast forward to last week, I was on coffee meets bagel and started talking to a girl. She was responsive, we had a lot in common, and while she did drop off the face of the earth for a bit, she came back, apologized, and gave me her number without me having to ask. CMB conversations expire after a period of inactivity, and since she paid to restart it to give me her number, I figured the apology was legit because of that. 

We kept texting and we have a date scheduled for next week. I always try and vet potential partners by looking them up in advance if I actually get a date scheduled, so I did it with her, too. I knew her job from her talking to me about it, so it was easy to verify on LinkedIn she was a real person. 

But, the picture on LinkedIn looked oddly familiar, and after some searching I matched it to the Hinge profile cuz I never unmatched her (I generally don't unmatch people unless they just clearly aren't interested or never respond at all cuz I'm lazy). I'm terrible at remembering faces, so I'm not too surprised I never recognized her, and the two apps had completely different pictures and prompts. I'm still going on the date, but now I'm a little more wary of her disappearing again.

Hi there, I make 140k today at a startup at a Senior IC level -  I have been here for 4 years and as of recent have felt less happy and motivated at work, and burnt out from the fully remote position, leadership doubts and change exhaustion. We had large layoffs a few months ago as well which definitely caused morale to go down. 

I received an offer from what has historically been a dream company of mine, highly established large tech company with a great office in nyc. That said, the offer will be 20k lower in base salary (but offers equity) at a junior IC level, and this is the very top of their band that I already negotiated to. They have way more benefits (free coffee, breakfast & lunch, hybrid schedule, 401k match, bonus, wellness stipend, etc).

The lower base and level downgrade stings, but I think looking at the offer more holistically and the room for growth makes it more appealing. Additionally, I love my current manager and would say that would be the toughest thing to leave along with some great colleagues.

I feel so torn - do I take this new offer?? ",1,1754590362.0,interviews,0,1.0,False
1mk7izs,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mk7izs/indian_mom_visiting_me_in_the_uk_soon_emotionally/,Indian mom visiting me in the UK soon ‚Äî emotionally exhausted & torn between guilt and protecting my peace,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a 29F Indian woman currently living in the UK. I‚Äôve been here for the past 4 years and have built a peaceful life, including a loving relationship with my partner, whom I met 3 years back, he is Russian. I recently came back to India for 10 days to help my mom (51F, single parent) pack and travel to the UK for her first-ever international trip. But these 8 days with her have left me emotionally drained and deeply confused.

My mother raised me and my younger sister alone after my father passed when I was 3. I deeply respect the struggles she went through. She worked relentlessly and gave us a decent education. But she was also highly controlling and emotionally abusive throughout my childhood ‚Äî shouting, guilt-tripping, forbidding me from having friends, obsessing over my grades so she could boast to others. I didn‚Äôt have a normal childhood ‚Äî I took on responsibilities far too early.

This trip back home has opened my eyes. Here are a few examples from just this week:

‚Ä¢	The Coffee Incident: I like to drink my morning coffee slowly. One morning I had just woken up and was sipping it when she started doing household chores. She‚Äôs been unwell (viral infection) and I calmly asked her to rest, saying I‚Äôd do the cleaning right after I finish my coffee. She snapped, saying things like ‚ÄúYou woke up late,‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I leave it to you, it won‚Äôt get done till 1pm,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou guys need one hour to finish coffee, nothing ever gets done.‚Äù I felt so bad, I poured the rest of my coffee down the sink and opened my laptop to start work early ‚Äî just to escape.

‚Ä¢	The Temple Guilt Trip: She wanted to go to a temple early morning (5 AM), even though I work from home 1 PM‚Äì11 PM with no breaks. I explained gently that I need sleep and am doing chores and caring for her while she‚Äôs unwell. She got offended, called me an atheist, and even told relatives on the phone, loud enough for me to hear, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an atheist in the house.‚Äù The next morning she missed the alarm (due to medication), woke late, and demanded we go now ‚Äî during heavy Mumbai monsoon and just before my work shift. When I said no, she lashed out again: ‚ÄúThis is what happens when you live with a white guy‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve become westernised.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	Bedroom Demands: She knows I‚Äôve lived with my partner for 2 years ‚Äî she never objected when we travelled abroad or lived together. But now, just two days before we fly to the UK together, she suddenly says she expects us to sleep in separate bedrooms while she‚Äôs visiting because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not married yet‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs against Indian culture.‚Äù My partner ‚Äî bless him ‚Äî has agreed to it just to keep the peace, but he‚Äôs also advising me not to bring her after how she‚Äôs treated me. And honestly? I agree with him.

She‚Äôs said things like:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI regret sending you abroad ‚Äî I thought you‚Äôd come back, not stay there forever with a boyfriend.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou‚Äôve changed, you don‚Äôt believe in God anymore.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never understand what I went through raising you girls alone.‚Äù

And the thing is ‚Äî I do understand. She lost her husband young, lives alone, is going through menopause, has no emotional support, and possibly has unresolved trauma. But‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt give her the right to emotionally abuse me and shame me for the life I‚Äôve created.

I‚Äôm exhausted.

I‚Äôve:
	‚Ä¢	Applied for her UK visa
	‚Ä¢	Paid for her international flights
	‚Ä¢	Travelled to India just to help her pack
	‚Ä¢	Cared for her while she‚Äôs been unwell

And yet‚Ä¶ all I get is guilt, control, emotional attacks, and disrespect for my partner and my values.

Now I‚Äôm stuck:
	‚Ä¢	If I don‚Äôt take her to the UK, I‚Äôll be guilt-tripped and shamed for ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù her forever
	‚Ä¢	If I do take her, I‚Äôm terrified of what she‚Äôll say or do once she‚Äôs in our home
	‚Ä¢	She may behave well in front of my partner and then attack me emotionally when we‚Äôre alone ‚Äî which has been her pattern for years

Has anyone been in a similar situation?
How do I set boundaries with someone who sees any independence as betrayal?
How do I protect my peace without drowning in guilt?

I want to believe I can break the cycle ‚Äî but right now, I feel stuck and small and so, so tired. I also considering to start therapy soon because I am scared of subconsciously inheriting such toxic behaviour and would like to protect my relationship with my partner. 

Any advice or support is appreciated.

Thanks for reading. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Just joined this group as I'm looking for some advice as I'm currently buying new furniture for my studio flat, which is quite small so I'm limited on space.

My Tv unit and sofa are 40"" apart, which is just over 1 metre. Ideally, I would like to have a small table in that space between the TV and sofa so I've got somewhere to put down a drink, tv remote, etc..

The problem is, most coffee tables are around 45-50cm or more in width which leaves only enough leg room of about 16"" infront of the sofa but leaves no space between the table and the TV unit.

This is not ideal but given my space, is there no other option for me?

As someone who thrives on coffee (probably too much, according to my friends), testing a single-serve coffee maker like this felt like stepping into caffeine heaven. The first thing I noticed was its sleek, modern design in a matte gray finish. It fit so well on my crowded kitchen counter that I barely had to shift anything around. The compact nature of the coffee machine, combined with its lightweight yet sturdy build, really made it a standout for me space-wise.

**Versatile Brewing Options**  
One of the major features that caught my attention was the customizable brewing options. The ability to brew four different cup sizes‚Äî6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces‚Äîmeant I never needed to brew more coffee than I actually drank. Using the Strong Brew button for that extra caffeine kick on groggy mornings has been my lifesaver. And then there‚Äôs the option to brew over ice, resulting in a refreshing iced coffee perfect for scorching afternoons. The functionality here really expanded its use for my varying caffeine needs.

Here's where this coffee maker truly shines. The Multistream Technology does wonders, saturating the coffee grounds more thoroughly than older models I‚Äôve used. The flavor extraction has been consistently better than what I get from my older brewer, producing a rich, aromatic cup every single time. Honestly, my kitchen smells like a coffee shop most mornings, and I‚Äôm not mad about it. Even my non-coffee-drinking roommate commented on how good it smells.

**User-Friendly Features**  
Operating this machine was a breeze, even for someone like me who has been guilty of fumbling through instructions. The button interface is straightforward, and the auto features make my mornings almost too easy. It‚Äôs fully automatic, so you just pop in a K-Cup or reusable filter with ground coffee, press a couple of buttons, and voil√†‚Äîpiping hot (or cold!) happiness. The removable reservoir is also super convenient. I didn‚Äôt have to lug the entire machine near the sink for refills. The dual-position reservoir was a game-changer for making it fit neatly into any setup.

**Upsides**  
- Space-efficient design with a stylish matte finish.  
- Several brewing size options to cater to varying preferences.  
- Multistream Technology enhances flavor extraction significantly.  
- Choices for strong coffee or iced coffee are appreciated.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
With all this praise, there are a few things to note.  
- The dripping can get messy if you remove the cup too quickly after brewing.  
- The plastic finish, though stylish, feels a bit fragile at times.  
- Slimmer water reservoirs might not work for larger households.  

**Competing Products**  
While comparing this coffee maker to others in its class, I thought of the Nespresso Vertuo and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Nespresso Vertuo is exceptional for espresso and crema but lacks the customizable brew sizes that the 062151515291 offers. On the other hand, the FlexBrew provides more adaptability with both pod and full coffee pot brewing options, but it takes longer to brew and doesn‚Äôt reach the convenience or aesthetic appeal of the Keurig. The standout here for me is the Multistream Technology, which competitors don‚Äôt seem to include, giving this model an edge for flavor consistency.

**Value for Money**  
Cost-wise, I found it to strike a balance between affordability and premium features. It delivers consistent flavor, has easy-to-use settings, and doesn‚Äôt require specialty pods like some competitors. While it isn‚Äôt the cheapest coffee maker in the market, it offers several appealing features that justify its pricing. The customizable coffee strength alone makes it worth considering for someone like me who craves variety. This machine embodies reliable quality without breaking the bank.

It's also about sensory experiences. ‚ÄçThink about the soft, warm feeling of sunlight streaming through a window, or the earthy scent of a potted‚Å¢ plant.

1mk7gyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mk7gyj/being_treated_for_adhd/,Being treated for Adhd,"I don't really know where else to ask since I don't know anyone with adhd. My doctor as recently started treating me for adhd and I'm just not sure. I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, part of me believes I could have adhd but at the same time I don't believe it. So let me explain. 

I'm tired, exhausted all the time and yet my thoughts never stop. Everyday tasks feel like work, getting out of bed to make coffee feels like the hardest thing in the world. I find myself forcing myself to eat to shower. It shouldn't be this hard just being alive. It's been like this for so long, I don't remember a time where I didn't feel tired regardless of how much sleep I get. 

My family tells me I'm depressed because I don't get out enough but the more I tell them how difficult it is for me to find the motivation to get out of bed or do anything, the more they tell me to just do it. I can't explain what it's like and they keep asking me why I'm so depressed but I don't know. I don't have an answer as to why I am the way I am. 

On the weekend I spend hours just doom scrolling and then I feel guilty because I've wasted the weekend, I feel useless most of the time. The part of me that doesn't believe I have adhd believes that maybe I'm making it worse than what it is. Like I'm trying to justify my laziness. 

When I was diagnosed with BPD my family didn't believe it, they said I'm just going through a low phase and it'll pass and the part of me that doubts the adhd clings to that, that there's nothing wrong with me and I'm making it up. 

The other part of me knows it's not normal to have loud thoughts, to not be able to watch a movie without having something else to do. It's not normal to zone out mid conversation, or forget things that's important. My mind feels like it's constantly screaming and I can't explain it to anyone.

A man named Mark (white, bald, probably in his 40s or 50s) approached me while I was looking at bras at Saint Anthony‚Äôs Church thrift store. He asked me personal questions (where I live, whether I had the day off, etc.) and then started asking for fashion advice. I gave short but polite answers, following the conditioning of being an agreeable woman. But then he asked if I wanted to get coffee with him. That‚Äôs when I felt the red flags. 

I declined and tried to create space between us by heading into the changing room. His eyes followed me as I walked toward it. The ‚Äúchanging room‚Äù is just a curtained-off corner of the women's section. The second I stepped in, my gut told me to not undress and that he was going to come in.

A minute later, he called me by name and without skipping a beat, pulled open the curtain and poked his head inside. He was clearly hoping to catch me naked. Thankfully, I was still fully dressed. I was horrified. I told him calmly but directly, ‚Äúthis is a changing room. You can‚Äôt be in here. I could‚Äôve been naked.‚Äù And with the creepiest fucking smirk I‚Äôve ever seen, he said ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs kind of the whole point if you know what I mean.‚Äù

I started screaming at him ‚Äì calling him a creep, telling him he was making me uncomfortable, trying to get the attention of the four other women in the room. Nobody intervened and I felt so alone. With enough yelling he started backing away. Someone from around the corner heard me and comforted me. They said he‚Äôd harassed them too. They told the staff what had happened, but I don‚Äôt know what action was taken. I left as quickly as I could so he couldn‚Äôt follow me.

Let me be very clear: This was intentional. This man followed me into a gendered space, waited until I was vulnerable, and tried to violate my privacy. It was predatory.

I‚Äôm reporting this to the church and filing a police report. If you shop there, please be cautious. I‚Äôm sharing this in the hope that it helps someone else stay safe.",30,1754589842.0,burlington,5,1.0,False

Kairi Walker said as she began mixing essential oils.

She was a hypnotist, crafting a unique coffee-scented fragrance that helped people forget painful memories. Her clients ranged from heartbroken women to extreme sports enthusiasts haunted by their experiences, and pet owners mourning their lost companions. Yet, she never imagined she'd one day use hypnosis on herself. Her aim was to erase all memories of the man she had loved for seven years.

""Kairi, what exactly happened with Emilio Vasquez? After the hypnosis, you‚Äôll completely erase him from your mind,"" Josh Walker asked, puzzled by his sister's decision.

Just two weeks earlier, Kairi had excitedly told him that Emilio had finally agreed to marry her. Josh had watched her enthusiastically plan the wedding, from choosing venues to fitting dresses and rings, genuinely happy for her.

Emilio was a chess prodigy sponsored by the Walker family for seven years. He was introverted, almost monk-like, living in a world solely defined by the black and white chess pieces. He had rejected Kairi's affections 99 times. As her brother, Josh had felt her pain as she always tried to break his icy demeanor, but it seemed she'd finally succeeded.

However, a few days later, Emilio was involved in a car accident on the way to a competition and claimed to have lost all memory of Kairi. The wedding was postponed.

""Emilio didn't lose his memory. He's pretending not to know me,"" Kairi said quietly, maintaining her composure.

She had overheard a conversation outside the hospital room, catching Emilio‚Äôs female apprentice planning a risky surgery. Afraid she wouldn't survive, she wanted a dream wedding beforehand.

""Emilio, your plan is brilliant. Pretending to marry Kairi made Liv Murphy break down and beg you to be her groom... Ugh, it's so corny.""

""She'll only have me.""

""Aren't you afraid Kairi will make a scene at the wedding?""

""Forget about her. She and I are strangers now. Speaking of which, isn‚Äôt she supposed to bring some of that homemade spiced honey cake again? Just toss it out for me.""

Kairi stood frozen, staring at the container in her hand, a wave of bitter sadness washing over her. Emilio wasn't naturally cold; he just wasn‚Äôt warm to her. Since he wanted to keep things distant, she'd let him have it his way! A man who had his heart set on another woman, she couldn‚Äôt care less about such nonsense.

""Emilio Vasquez is a piece of work!"" Josh's veins bulged with anger, containing his fury. ""Forgetting him is definitely the best choice.""

""Right."" Kairi had already deleted everything relating to Emilio from her phone. She held the coffee-scented fragrance and a pocket watch, opened the door to the hypnosis room, and stepped inside.

""Kairi!"" Josh called out to her. ""That heir to the Wagner family was severely burned in a fire a few years ago, with 90% of his body covered in scars. Although they helped us before, your happiness shouldn't be the price you pay. If you don‚Äôt want to...""",1,1754589834.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I was sitting here sobbing because I don‚Äôt have the right kind of friend to call to just lose it to, you know?
I‚Äôm 44. When I was 41 I was an empty nester making really good money (yes super young mom). My girls were graduated and building lives and my partner and I moved to a warm weather state, and my youngest daughter came with. 
An issue in my relationship appeared in 2019, with my partners sexuality and an emotional affair, as well as all of the sudden developing kinks.  I thought this issue would never end us, but it got dramatically worse so at this time I wasn‚Äôt super happy. 
My partner had a vasectomy in 2016. In Feb of ‚Äò22 I was scheduled to have an ablation. Well, that didn‚Äôt happen because I was pregnant. When they told me I didn‚Äôt even flinch and said oh not my file. She showed me and it was like my whole body just‚Ä¶ went numb. I took a week off work just to try and absorb it.
Now, I‚Äôve volunteered with PP for years. I‚Äôm 100% pro-choice but ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt choose to. I just didn‚Äôt go to the appointment. I couldn‚Äôt, I just kept thinking the odds were so against this baby yet there it was. 
So, I gave birth in Oct 22. I‚Äôm going to bullet point the rest.
*  Partner refused to give even an opinion about keeping the baby. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your body‚Äù
Ok great I fucking know that do you want to raise a kid with me?
*  Not a single person in my life thought I should have it except my 20 yr old daughter. 
*  it was a very lonely and extremely physically difficult pregnancy
* his birth was an emergency C-section
I labored for‚Ä¶. 41 hours‚Ä¶to only get to push twice. The surgery was traumatic. I told them I could feel and no one believed me. The next year, through another medical treatment it was discovered I had CYP2C19, a genetic disorder that renders some anesthesia and other meds ineffective. Guess what? I had 33% of the usual dose needed for someone with my condition. I felt it and I proved it.
* my son was just so beautiful and both of my girls came and everyone loved him even if they hadn‚Äôt thought it a good idea. My partner sobbed and said how sorry he was
*  on my sons 4 week birthday I was laid off from my forever job, and I was the higher paid of the 2 of us. The state I live in caps unemployment at a max of $3000.  In total. No matter how long you struggle to find work. 
* the next few months my mental health tanked. My partner had been just bombarding me wi the sex and kink shit all the time and I felt terrible about being unemployed. We also found out our son had a heart condition. (Currently fine)
* I had extreme PPD. Only it wasn‚Äôt that I had difficulty with interest in the babe, more the opposite. He had a monitor on his diaper, the owlet sock, a video monitor‚Ä¶. But I was convinced something bad was going to happen.
* when he was four months old I knew he was autistic. Moms know. There were just small nuances and no eye contact and I personally believe my partner may be on the spectrum plus we are old parents lol.
Everyone thought I was crazy.
* by 6 months old, I was having extreme suicidal thoughts and self admitted to a women‚Äôs treatment center for mental health. It was wonderful and helped me so much. WHILE I was there it did. I went home to the same sexual coercion and inability to find work. I also found out FROM HIM that he actually took the twilight cocktail for the vasectomy but never went. Cool huh?
* I was having weird pain all the time in different places and I‚Äôd have periods of three days where I would fever off and on with so much pain. Long story eventually diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. 
* Fibro, and PPD, and eventual PPP consumed my life until my son was nearly 2. Pain and depression and sobbing all the time. All I wanted was to die.
* I attempted suicide in July of ‚Äò24
* I went back to the women‚Äôs mental health center for another 30
Days and this time I put so much hard work in and finally had hope.
* Not so fast! While I was in treatment my partner had let the month to month lease end in our 3/2 and rented a one bedroom apartment. He made our son‚Äôs room a duplicate of the house. I‚Äôd also been staying home since the job market sucked, a decision made together, but he opened a new bank account and sent his checks there.
* there‚Äôs so much more to that story but it‚Äôs bullshit 
* I left treatment homeless and jobless. I went from a life of calm and ability to pay bills and still do things I wanted‚Ä¶ to having nothing to show for it.
* Guess who is the only person with a couch I could sleep on? Yes the ex. And so I‚Äôve been here for 10 months. 

I‚Äôve applied to 309 jobs. I tailor my cover letters. Even though I have a Bachelors in HR, I paid a professional resume service. I interview well, and actually like it because for a long time I was the one interviewing candidates. I haven‚Äôt found a job. I‚Äôve applied to Dunkin Donuts, coffee shops, places and positions I‚Äôm grossly overqualified for but I would do anything.
Nothing pans out. 

Today, I had a real and true interview in a new field that I was really hopeful about. 
She came on to the interview and said she was so sorry but for some reason she thought I was in a different location, and they actually don‚Äôt have one within a 45 min drive.

I hate this life. If it were not for my son I would not choose to keep living and that‚Äôs just me being honest. I‚Äôve gained 80 lbs from all the fucking mental health meds that don‚Äôt help me mentally and so it‚Äôs just been a matter of throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. Yes I‚Äôve had the genetic testing, but my genetic disorder rules out many of them. I sleep in a dining room and my ex sleeps on a couch. He isn‚Äôt happy. He works and games. He has let his hygiene go and hasn‚Äôt seen his family in 3 years.  He‚Äôs on an antidepressant too. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt keep living like this, I refuse to. But no matter what I do I can‚Äôt get a fucking leg up. Just one win. One even smallish thing to hang on to for hope. 

That‚Äôs all. If you read this far you probably are a person waiting for a flight or trying to look busy ü§£

1mk78qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChurchOfMineta/comments/1mk78qy/tsuneta_noir_violent_sunrise_part_01/,Tsuneta noir - Violent Sunrise - Part 01,"She setting sun painted the sky in a deep orange, dissolving into shades of purple as the city below began to light up. It was that moment between day and night when the world seemed suspended, caught between two states. The evening breeze blew cool and sharp, carrying the distant scent of hot asphalt and cigarettes forgotten in sidewalk ashtrays.

Tsuyu Asui moved swiftly across the rooftops, leaping from building to building with the precision of someone who had done it for years. Her body moved with the ease of an experienced predator, her silhouette etched against the dying glow of the horizon. When the gaps between buildings were too wide, her tongue snapped out like a whip, latching onto poles and antennas to launch her forward. Every motion was deliberate. Every landing, flawless. She was a professional now. Hero, rank 34.

Time had passed. Her posture‚Äîmore upright, more assertive‚Äîreflected the maturity of someone who had seen enough to no longer be easily impressed. The delicate features of her youth had given way to a more defined expression, and her body, now fully developed, carried the strength and femininity that time had granted her. Her wide hips swayed subtly with each landing, not out of carelessness, but simply because she was a grown woman now‚Äîshaped by years of work and experience.

She didn‚Äôt need to look down to know the city‚Äôs eyes were following her. To the average person, heroes were icons‚Äîshadows dancing between flickering neon lights, promises of safety in a world that never stopped producing monsters. But for her, this life had become routine. The desperate faces of citizens, the muffled cries from dark alleys, the chases that always ended the same way‚Äînone of it gave her the same rush it once did.

Tonight‚Äôs mission was simple: apprehend a bank robber who had been terrorizing the city for the past few weeks. The agency she worked for had sent her alone, confident she could handle the case. But for some reason, they‚Äôd told her she‚Äôd have a partner. His name hadn‚Äôt been mentioned‚Äîonly that he was a lower-ranking hero, someone more flexible when it came to gathering intel and conducting investigations.

The idea annoyed her. Working with an unknown meant adjusting her rhythm, dealing with unexpected variables. But it wasn‚Äôt just that. There was something about this mission that felt‚Ä¶ different. Hard to define. As if the dusk itself, with all its weight and mystery, was trying to whisper a secret she couldn‚Äôt quite hear.

A flickering sign on a nearby building reflected in her sharp eyes. She didn‚Äôt allow herself the luxury of speculation. Whatever this feeling was, she‚Äôd have her answer soon enough.

The air turned colder as she landed softly on the edge of a rooftop. Below, the city lights spread out like an artificial ocean, while the world of crime continued to stir in the shadows.

And she was ready to dive in.

The city around her melted into a mosaic of long shadows and flickering lights. On the horizon, skyscrapers shimmered like neon-glass ghosts, while the smaller neighborhoods revealed a grittier, less theatrical Japan. Tsuyu dropped into a narrow street‚Äîa tight alley between mid-rise commercial buildings. It was a crossroads of everyday life: narrow pedestrian lanes flanked by corner shops and modest restaurants, their signs faded by time. The air smelled of oil and cigarettes, mixed with the soft buzz of neon lights hesitating between life and death.

Up ahead, a modest bank stood out from the scenery. Its doors hung open‚Äînot blasted by force, but unlocked with surgical precision. There was no debris, only a clean hole where the locks used to be, as if some invisible force had unmade the security with ease.

Inside the bank, someone was already there.

A hero.

**Chargebolt.**

Denki Kaminari turned when he saw her‚Äîhis uniform slightly wrinkled, blond hair still sticking up like always. His rank: 48. But the carefree smile remained. He raised a hand in a friendly wave, as if they were meeting for coffee instead of standing in the middle of a meticulously executed heist scene.

‚ÄúYo, Tsu! Long time, huh?‚ÄùHis tone was relaxed, but something felt off. The surroundings were¬†*too*¬†calm. No sirens. No chaos. The explosion at the front had been too clean, too precise.

Tsuyu narrowed her eyes, studying him. Kaminari looked the same as always‚Äîeasy smile, friendly face‚Äîbut there was something in the way he kept his hands in his pockets, like he was hiding the tension in his fingers.

‚ÄúDenki.‚Äù She gave a slight smile, her voice steady. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect you to be on the investigation.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so it was you they sent? Heh, what a coincidence.‚Äù He chuckled, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúBut honestly, I was just on patrol and stumbled across the scene. Got curious and checked it out. You know me‚Äîfieldwork‚Äôs never been my thing.‚Äù

Tsuyu glanced at the wreckage around them. ‚ÄúAnd what did you find?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, they made a nice mess at the entrance, but inside... it‚Äôs like someone cleaned up afterward.‚Äù He pointed toward the interior of the bank, where the floor gleamed like it had just been polished. ‚ÄúThe vault was broken into, but no explosions. Probably someone with brute strength.‚Äù

She stepped in a few paces, examining the scene. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense. Ribbit. If they had the tech to clean up, why leave the fa√ßade wrecked?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight?‚Äù Kaminari let out a short laugh, but his eyes flicked away for a moment. ‚ÄúI only gave it a surface look. You know I‚Äôm not great at this kind of thing.‚Äù

Tsuyu crossed her arms, watching him. ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre getting smarter. That might be the most intelligent thing I‚Äôve heard you say in years.‚Äù

He smiled, unfazed. ‚ÄúI try to study, but, well‚Ä¶ my brain fries easily.‚Äù

She gave a thoughtful ‚Äúhm.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo who‚Äôs helping me with the investigation?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs someone from our class, there are some great minds. Yaoyorozu, Midoriya... even Mineta.‚Äù

Kaminari laughed. ‚ÄúMineta? Still holding a grudge, huh?‚Äù

Tsuyu‚Äôs expression hardened. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust him. Ribbit.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, come on. Mineta might be a perv with no filter, but he‚Äôs harmless. I bet he spends all his money on porn, not on anything serious.‚Äù

Tsuyu rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúAt least¬†*you*¬†grew up.‚Äù

Kaminari shrugged. ‚ÄúYeah... I guess I got tired of the nonsense. Funny enough, Mineta‚Äôs pulled back too. I always tried to get him to hang around Bakugo, but he‚Äôd always mess it up.‚Äù

The heroine snorted. ‚ÄúHe was never reliable. I don‚Äôt even know how he still has a hero license.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny you say that.‚Äù Kaminari tilted his head, a glint in his eye. ‚ÄúLately, he‚Äôs been doing a lot of undercover work, going into the underworld. Maybe he‚Äôs getting a little too comfortable there‚Ä¶ starting to¬†*understand*¬†how things work down below.‚Äù

Tsuyu felt a chill down her spine. ‚ÄúMineta, going corrupt?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh, don‚Äôt worry. I bet he just wears disguises to sneak into hostess clubs without the media finding out.‚Äù

She laughed softly, but something about the conversation itched at the back of her mind. Kaminari checked his watch and sighed.

‚ÄúWell, my shift‚Äôs up. Good luck with the case.‚Äù‚ÄúThanks. Oh‚Äîsay hi to Jirou for me.‚Äù

Kaminari blushed faintly and turned a little too fast, walking away with stiff, hurried steps.

Tsuyu stayed behind, a strange taste in her mouth. Something was wrong. Very wrong.‚ÄúHe said Midoriya was slow, but he got with Ochaco. Now he won‚Äôt even ask Jirou out‚Ä¶‚Äù she muttered, thinking of her musician friend.

Civilians flowed by as if nothing had happened, each wrapped up in their own world. The explosion barely registered as more than a distant noise. Some cast curious glances at the ruined bank, but quickly moved on‚Äîused to seeing heroes tidy up chaos.

Tsuyu, however, felt a disturbance. A chill ran down her skin as her trained eyes swept the surroundings. Her instincts screamed that something‚Äîor someone‚Äîwas near.

Without hesitation, she launched upward in a clean jump, gripping a concrete ledge with perfect precision. She climbed swiftly, hands and feet sticking to the aging wall, until she reached a dark spot above street level.

There, hidden in the shadows, was a figure.

Before it could react, her tongue cracked through the air like a whip. With a wet snap, it wrapped around the intruder before he could escape. She yanked, pulling him up and holding him before her.

‚ÄúRibbit‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her voice was low, but firm as steel.

In the faint light, the silhouette took shape: small, compact, strangely familiar. As her eyes adjusted, recognition hit.

Mineta.

He squirmed slightly, surprised but far from panicked.

The heroine held him tight, tilting her head just slightly as she evaluated him.

‚ÄúYou with me, or against me?‚Äù

Her eyes shone in the dark, studying every twitch of his expression.He‚Äôd better answer fast‚Ä¶ before she decided his fate.

‚ÄúIf I said I was one of the good guys, would you believe me?‚Äù Mineta replied, voice dry, eyes half-lidded in something close to apathy. Tsuyu‚Äôs tongue tightened around him, cold and damp, pressing lightly against his skin.

She tilted her head again, eyes wide and analytical, reflecting her uncertainty. ‚ÄúOh right‚Ä¶¬†*you*¬†.‚Äù

Without warning, Tsuyu let go.

Mineta dropped from the rooftop, landing hard on his back with a painful thud.

‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶‚Äù he groaned, arching his back and rubbing his neck.",2,1754589714.0,ChurchOfMineta,1,1.0,False

1mk76k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mk76k1/how_does_the_breville_precision_brewer_compare_to/,How Does the Breville Precision Brewer Compare to Other Coffee Machines?,"I‚Äôve had the chance to test the Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1 for a few weeks now, and let me just say, it has its moments of brilliance and occasional head-scratchers. A consistent morning cup of coffee is practically a necessity for me, so when I heard about a coffee maker claiming ‚Äúprecision,‚Äù I was more than willing to give it a shot. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs quite good, but not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The brushed stainless steel finish immediately caught my attention. This coffee maker stands tall and narrow, making it space-efficient while still looking sleek on my counter. Its dimensions, 12.72 inches in depth, 6.69 inches in width, and 15.75 inches in height, make it manageable even in tighter kitchens. The buttons and interface are straightforward, although the design might feel a tad industrial to those who prefer a modern or minimalist aesthetic. On the flipside, the quality feels durable, and the carafe‚Äîthermal and with a good, sturdy grip‚Äîkeeps coffee hotter for longer compared to most machines I‚Äôve used before.

**Performance Features**  
The Breville Precision Brewer indeed lives up to its name in many respects. It‚Äôs packed with six customizable presets: Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew, which ensure your coffee is tailored to your preferences. If you're someone like me who loves experimenting with brewing strength and temperature, this thing is an absolute playground. For the My Brew option, I could tweak parameters such as bloom time, brew temperature, and flow rate. The result? A cup of coffee that was floral and fruity or earthy and robust, depending on how I wanted to start my day.  

[Check Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b078rqvqf1/)  

**Key Benefits**  
- Six brew modes, including options for Gold Cup standard and cold brew.
- Precise temperature control using a PID system.
- Dual filter baskets (flat bottom and cone) allow for versatility depending on the coffee batch size.  
- Compatibility with pour-over adapters like Hario V60 or Kalita Wave.  
- Fully automatic operation simplifies the brewing process beautifully.

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its strong arsenal of features, a few things left me scratching my head:  
- It‚Äôs not the quietest brewer around. During operation, there‚Äôs a noticeable hum that my early-morning brain could have done without.  
- The initial setup seems a bit too complicated for those not thrilled about reading user manuals, especially with features like water hardness testing.  
- While the thermal carafe keeps coffee warm for hours, it‚Äôs tricky to pour without spilling unless you‚Äôre very patient.  

**Competing Products**  
When lined up against similar high-end coffee makers, the Breville Precision Brewer usually takes the edge for its insane level of brewing customization. Machines like the Technivorm Moccamaster are often touted as industry favorites thanks to their simplicity and reliability, but the Breville wins points for versatility with its cold brew and iced settings. Compared to the Bonavita Connoisseur, which offers great temperature control, the Breville feels a step ahead in allowing settings personalization. However, it is pricier than competitors, which may influence you if you‚Äôre comparing on value alone.

**Value for Money**  
Is it worth it? That‚Äôs subjective. For someone who‚Äôs brewing several cups daily and likes to switch between basic drip coffee and cold brew, investing in this coffee maker makes sense. The control over temperature, flow rate, and brewing time delivers rich results. On the other hand, casual coffee drinkers might balk at both the initial costs and the occasional learning curve. However, its durability, precision, and multifunctionality justify the expense for enthusiasts.

I‚Äôm 24 , he‚Äôs a few years older. I just need some advice really.

Gosh it was amazing. We met on a dating app, and he asked me to go out the following day. I wouldn‚Äôt usually go out so quickly with a guy but I had a really good feeling about him, so I did it. On the date he told me he asked me out so early as he is too busy to go out for the next 2 weeks, so wanted to meet before this period of time. We had so many things in common. We‚Äôre both Christians, have similar views on politics, life, so many things. I found him handsome, he‚Äôs sporty like me. He was so polite. He was really so masculine , we were even talking about another city that‚Äôs got a lot of crime and he told me ‚Äò don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôd be safe with me there I‚Äôd be sure to protect you‚Äô.

He gave me alot of eye contact , even if there were silences he would continue to stare at me. He told me thing such as ‚Äò that‚Äôs a long story, next time I will tell you‚Äô. He asked me if I had particular views about a particular topic which he knew about, and I told him I didn‚Äôt , he said ‚Äò you will later‚Äô. He mentioned aswel going out to eat next time( we just had a coffee this time) but no concrete plans were made. My mom sent me a message saying where are you, he saw it and said ‚Äò you should answer that, I don‚Äôt want her to get a bad impression of me already‚Äô. I also noticed at the end when he waited with me for my transport home, he seemed to get closer to me. When I got home after the date he asked if I enjoyed it and I asked him if he did , he said ‚ÄòI certainly did‚Äô.

The thing that bothers me is that he is very busy with his work. He has only been sending me one text per day since the date. Like I said before, he told me for the next 2 weeks he‚Äôs very busy and can‚Äôt go out. However one of his messages asked me which is a restaurant I like here, but he didn‚Äôt ask me out yet, maybe he will later after the 2 week period? On the date he told me he had been single for a very long time, as he told me women don‚Äôt always want to come along for the ride, but that although he is still busy he has more structure than he previously did. I mean, is the one message a day a sign he‚Äôs not interested ?

I know it‚Äôs early days, but does he seem interested? At first I thought maybe it‚Äôs bad he‚Äôs not been texting more etc, but idk maybe it‚Äôs not a bad thing that things are going slower? But I‚Äôm concerned if this continues and I‚Äôm often feeling like he‚Äôs too busy for me? He also mentioned work trips abroad he‚Äôs got to go on too relatively soon and ( although I don‚Äôt think they are that lengthy - maybe a week or two).

1mk73s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brad_taste_in_music/comments/1mk73s0/parting_lots_of_thoughts/,parting + lots of thoughts,"hello everyone, amber please here; i believe some of y'all might recognize my name

not like this is an airport and gotta announce my department but thought about leaving my 2 cents here, since i used to be a regular viewer of brad's work and i care about some of the other names that popped up in chat. if anything, i wanna talk about everything surrounding brad instead of focusing on him

i guess we tend to parasocially attach to creators because they kinda mirror some stuff within ourselves. even at this point i won't uhhh disown? my enjoyment of brad's content but i gotta recognize i come from a place of being an ancient 30yo person that had to endure some serious self-reflection at ages 20-24. i do believe we all tend to undergo some troubling times during our early 20's and i'm not completely proud of how i handled things out, so i guess it was interesting to be a witness of someone's development in that regard; even more when there's mental health issues in the mix for everyone involved

with that being said, i do think brad's community mirrors itself on him because his content does have value. i guess this is the point where i have to kiss brad's ass a bit because i genuinely think he's a good curator, he's able to make connections across bands, genres or eras, which is not an easy task tbh. granted, he did wayyyyy more reactions than topic-related videos but even at that, i'm not sure i can see xqc or kai cenat articulating themselves regarding music and its environment

but hindsight is 20/20 and now i realize his input wasn't that big to begin with, because his community was the one that gave insight in all sense. small detail i guess but i do remember one time he received a tricky song, the one with the portishead beat, and brad berated tricky a bit as a newer artist ruining things up, then chat corrected him and brad conceded; i guess that stuck with me because idk, perhaps don't rely on chat for info? make a small research while you're listening? brandon bowling (i believe that was his name, apologies if that's not the case) gave the greatest mini reviews fr, and you would see brad agreeing with plenty of what he said, sometimes using them as base for his insight. all of this to say: perhaps brad didn't have much music insight, but he certainly attracted people that did

same with all the bands that would send him stuff through his streams, and gained popularity because of it, or gained insight on how to improve. brad has decently open ears to weirder stuff and it's hard to find people that 1.-like such stuff and 2.-give good feedback about it. his insight, as limited as it might've been, did offer recommendations for both artists and listeners, and i don't think that value should be undermined giving all that happened. it's natural for a community to grow from that environment, it's natural to have a sense of positive feedback in it

i fear kendrick is totally right when he says ""once a lame, always a lame"", because we all followed a loser in here and that definitely says something about us lmao again, hindsight, the signs were there but we gave brad the benefit of the doubt because well, he's awkward and i'm willing to bet we're pretty much the same in here, and we know now how maintaining an online platform is hard and WILL crush a mf. sadly, i don't think brad's actions can be somewhat ""justified"" in this regard

nothing could've prepared me for those audios, man. i heard the arrest one first and i physically recoiled at brad's legit demon impersonation. the liar one wasn't that easy to listen either. i really hope i don't have to eat my words up, but it's hard for me to think tina was so abusive that granted an ""equal"" response coming from brad like, i'm not sure brad can come out with something even worse that can equate to this. i apologize for talking about someone else's personal life but again, mirroring, it was super nice when tina appeared on chat, or when she would literally appear on stream to tell brad to go to sleep, i even remember one video where she brought brad some coffee and he said (pharaphrasing) ""it's all frothy and it has cinnamon in top, she's the best"". how nice that this young couple are living together, by themselves, taking care of dogs and being engaged. so yeah, it's so chilling to think super bad things happened in the background

so yeah, i've yapped enough so to close things off: some audience members did really get inspired by brad and started their own creative endeavours or some musical knowledge journey. don't let all of this to discourage you from your path and keep going because this world is too cruel and we shouldn't let our passionate side ever die. it's likely that you saw yourself in brad but it's been in you during all this time, so keep sowing it. i will definitely do for sure

my heart aches for tina because that sole detention audio would've break things off for me, can't believe there's more. i wish her the absolute best, and to never let someone else treat her like that again. i hope this doesn't come out as victim blaming, but it's worthy to do some self-reflection and ask yourself why you endured so much in the first place. there's healing in there. also don't go the brad route and drag things off for everyone's sake, but i think that's what you get when he mentions the whole situation in the first place. a big, warm hug for u tina

same thing for this community. most of you are very cool people and I HOPE there's some form of salvation for all of us because i for sure don't wanna be a loser at 30 lmao but i actually take solace that, in my worst times, i never let things get THIS out of hand. so yeah, soul-searching so we hopefully never mirror the worst side of brad, ever

brad, if you're reading this, quit the internet and legit surrender yourself to therapy or something. i know you expressed some SI; please stop weaponizing it, i won't say i didn't do it when i was younger but that's the point, it's shitty even if the sentiment is real, so don't. i hope you decide to work on yourself instead, it's hard but rewarding job. and realize that feeling good is not the same as feeling better. i do see value in you, and i do think you can be a better person and rebuild your life up, but you do need a soul steal and literally start over again because seems to me like the apple is literally rotten to the core. do you like the person that you are right now? i certainly don't, and you should be ashamed of yourself

take care everyone, hope to see you on another creator' stream",3,1754589411.0,Brad_taste_in_music,0,0.8,False

1mk739f,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mk739f/evaluate_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Evaluate best single serve coffee maker Keurig K-Mini is it worth it,"Sleek. Compact. Simple. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôd describe the Keurig 062151516236 after spending weeks testing it out. My kitchen is a relatively small space, so I‚Äôm always on the hunt for appliances that don‚Äôt hog all the counter real estate. This little guy? Less than 5 inches wide. It slid perfectly into the narrow gap between my toaster and the wall without looking awkward or buried. It‚Äôs advertised as ‚Äúpoppy red,‚Äù and I'd say the color really pops! It‚Äôs fun but still blends well with a range of kitchen aesthetics, especially with its matte finish. Who said compact had to mean boring?  

**Ease of Use**  
If you‚Äôre like me and groggy mornings aren‚Äôt your strong suit, this coffee maker was nothing short of a lifesaver. It‚Äôs probably one of the most user-friendly coffee makers I've come across. Fill the one-cup reservoir with fresh water, toss in a K-Cup pod, press the button, and voil√†‚Äîyour coffee is brewing. It‚Äôs basically foolproof. One of the perks here is how quickly it works, and truthfully, the promise of ‚Äúcoffee in minutes‚Äù isn‚Äôt an oversell. This thing is speedy and efficient, which I appreciated every time I rushed out the door for work.  

[Check Keurig 062151516236 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b096yr1w7r/)  

**Energy Saving Features**  
I know energy efficiency sounds like something that shouldn‚Äôt make much of a difference for a coffee maker, but it does. The auto-off feature shuts the machine down just 90 seconds after finishing a brew. That extra eco-friendly touch had me feeling less guilty about my daily caffeine habit. It‚Äôs also great from a safety standpoint‚ÄîI can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve left the house wondering if I had left some appliance on.  

**Travel Mug Compatible**  
This might be one of the first coffee makers I‚Äôve owned that genuinely considers commuters. My 7"" travel mug fit snuggly without a problem, and the removable drip tray ensures that any accidental overflow won‚Äôt leave you scrubbing your counters for hours. The drip tray also held a full accidental brew during my ‚Äúoops‚Äù moment, which saved my morning. The design just feels like it was well thought out.  

**Good Points**  
- Compact design fits even the smallest countertops.  
- Simple operation requiring only three steps.  
- Recyclable K-Cup compatibility for an eco-friendlier choice.  
- Energy-saving auto-off function adds safety and convenience.  

**Drawbacks**  
Unfortunately, nothing‚Äôs perfect‚Äîthis coffee maker included. While the ‚Äúone-cup reservoir‚Äù makes the unit more compact, refilling water for every use can get a little annoying on busy mornings. Even if the water reservoir had just a slightly larger capacity, it would‚Äôve made a massive difference. The pod-only system also limits flexibility unless you grab the optional reusable filter for ground coffee, which is sold separately. Finally, as lightweight as it is, this coffee maker sometimes feels a bit too flimsy and could be sturdier.  

- Frequent water refills because of the small reservoir.  
- Requires an additional reusable filter for ground coffee lovers.  
- Lightweight design could use more durable construction.  

**Competing Products**  
Curious how it stacks up against other single-serve coffee makers? I tested it alongside the Nespresso Essenza Mini and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. Both competitors have their pros, but the Keurig holds its own. The Nespresso offers slightly better espresso quality, but it‚Äôs pricier and relies heavily on exclusive pods. Meanwhile, the FlexBrew gives more freedom by accommodating ground coffee and pods, but it felt bulkier and less elegant than this sleek machine. The Keurig really shines for its blend of aesthetics and straightforward functionality, which makes it ideal for convenience-driven users looking for a compact, no-fuss option.  

**Financial Value**  
Where this coffee maker really excels is in its affordability for the features it delivers. Larger machines with similar single-serve capabilities often cost a chunk more, and even though you‚Äôll need to invest in reusable coffee filters if you want to skip K-Cups, it‚Äôs still a budget-friendly buy compared to premium models. It‚Äôs a good blend of practicality and modern functionality that doesn‚Äôt make you feel like you paid a small fortune for morning coffee.

I found it laying around recently when I was running late, it was a rainy day so I threw it on with some jeans and put a raincoat on, little did I know the raincoat tag had harsh edges which caught hold of the lace on the side of the cami..

I‚Äôve been taking levothyroxine for a few months now and my tsh was a little over 4 last I checked. I‚Äôm at 112mcg and have some improvement to where I‚Äôm not sleeping all day but I still wake up tired and my energy crashes around 3-5pm. I have a two year old and this has all been extremely hard to deal with. 

I‚Äôve also been trying to lose weight and I‚Äôm just at a point where I feel like there‚Äôs no hope and I will never get my normal self back again. Im not new to weight loss, I‚Äôve lost 65lbs before, and gained some back through covid, then lost 30lbs again. Between pregnancy and breastfeeding I gained 100lbs at my heaviest point. I barely even knew myself at that point. I managed to lost about 20lbs until I started having symptoms and was diagnosed with hashimotos. 

I have absolutely no motivation anymore. I‚Äôm a full time student and a stay at home mom so I have my hands full as it is. I just don‚Äôt know how to do it this time (weight loss). I‚Äôve also had disordered eating in the past and was vegan for three years. I‚Äôve found that very restrictive diets cause me to binge on unhealthy foods. I barely get any time to myself as it is, I just don‚Äôt know how to fit in a diet and excersize. I do lots of activities with my son, run around outside and play, swimming, parks. I also cook balanced meals with protein( not enough though because I‚Äôm sometime picky about meat and the taste of it), carbs, and always a veggie. I drink lots of water and try to get a few fruits in everyday. I‚Äôve been relying on a cup of coffee in the morning and a Yerba mate in the afternoon to get me through the day but I hate how much caffeine I‚Äôm drinking (200mg) and about 40g of sugar.

1mk70py,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechTruthSerum/comments/1mk70py/explore_the_best_laptop_for_power_users_dell/,Explore the Best Laptop for Power Users Dell Inspiron 15 3530 Review,"Testing the Dell Inspiron 15 3530 has been an interesting journey for me, especially as someone who relies on laptops daily for work and entertainment. From its sleek design to impressive internals, it‚Äôs a laptop that delivers value in most areas but still has its quirks.

**Sleek Design with a Comfortable Build**  
This laptop isn't trying too hard to grab attention, which, frankly, I appreciate for a work setting. The carbon black finish gives it a professional and minimalist vibe that feels very ‚ÄúDell.‚Äù It's lightweight for a 15.6-inch laptop, clocking in at 3.64 pounds, making it easy to carry around from meeting rooms to coffee shops. The design is thin at just 0.75 inches, which makes sliding it into a laptop sleeve or backpack effortless. The keyboard is tactile with decent spacing for someone like me who spends hours typing each day. However, the absence of a backlit keyboard stings a little during late-night work.

**Impressive Touchscreen and Display Quality**  
Working with the 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen has been a game-changer for my presentations and creative brainstorming. The 1920 x 1080 resolution paired with anti-glare technology ensures that the screen remains clear under various lighting conditions. Scrolling and interaction on the touchscreen are smooth, though responsive calibration could improve slightly. Watching movies and editing images becomes enjoyable with the vibrant, narrow border display. Still, the color accuracy isn't on par with laptops in the Ultrabook category, so serious video editors might have to think twice.

**Check [Dell Inspiron 15 3530](https://powerfinders.com/p/b0cb6tft9k/) deals on Amazon now.**

**Powerful Performance with 13th Gen Intel Core i7**  
As far as power goes, this machine positions itself as a workhorse. The Dell Inspiron 15 3530 packs a 13th Generation Intel Core i7 processor with 10 cores and 12 threads, which might sound excessive for casual users but is phenomenal for multitasking. Opening multiple Chrome tabs while running Photoshop and streaming a video on another window never showed significant slowdowns. Its 32GB DDR4 RAM supports seamless, lag-free transitions between programs. Even intense projects, like rendering 3D models, don't faze the performance. That said, the fan noise gets noticeable during demanding tasks, which could be distracting in quiet environments.

**Spacious Storage Solutions**  
One of the standout features here is the 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD. It's incredibly fast, and booting up the system or loading large software takes seconds. This storage solution is plenty for keeping all my work documents, media files, and even large software installations all in one place without worrying about running out of space. However, users might miss out on additional hard drive expandability options found in some competing laptops.

**Benefits**  
- Lightweight and slim design makes it portable.  
- 13th Gen Intel Core ensures a smooth multitasking experience.  
- Touchscreen functionality boosts productivity.  
- Ample storage room for most users' needs.  

**Wi-Fi 6 and Excellent Connectivity Options**  
The Wi-Fi 6 capability on this laptop has honestly been a blessing. I've noticed faster browsing and file downloads compared to my older laptops. It maintains consistent and stable connections, even when several devices are hooked onto the same network. The various ports include three USB options (one USB-C and two USB-As), HDMI 1.4, and an SD card reader‚Äîeverything I typically need in my day-to-day tasks. It even features a headphone and microphone combo jack for voice calls. Sadly, Dell decided to skip the optical drive on this model, although that feels less crucial in modern setups.

**Industry Competitors**  
When comparing this laptop to something like the HP Pavilion 15 or the Lenovo IdeaPad 5, each has its unique strengths. The Pavilion 15 excels with its high battery life and better display color accuracy, while the IdeaPad 5 is lighter and cheaper. However, neither matches the Inspiron 15 3530 in raw processing power and storage capacity. For tasks like coding, heavy office applications, or graphic work, the combination of its i7 processor and ample RAM is hard to beat in this price bracket.

**Audio and Webcam Experience**  
Dell has equipped this machine with stereo speakers that deliver decent audio quality. If you're attending Zoom calls or simply streaming Netflix, you'll find the sound clear and detailed. Personally, though, I'd pair it with headphones for an enhanced experience. The integrated 1080p webcam is a definite plus for virtual meetings. It's not the sharpest webcam I've used, but it does its job well in well-lit environments. Dimly lit conditions, however, reveal grainy footage, which is common even in higher-priced laptops.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Given its features, I'd say this laptop provides value for what it offers. While competing devices may undercut this in price, the Inspiron 15 3530‚Äôs specs deliver better power, storage, and multitasking abilities than most of its peers in the same range. For professionals like me who regularly handle demanding workloads, it‚Äôs a solid investment. On the flip side, casual users or students might find its higher-end specs underutilized.

Reasonable hour expectation (1800, and this is the actual expectation not a minimum) the exact right practice areas, really enjoyed talking to the partners I interviewed with, good location, and they even brought up the idea of paying for my Tax LLM. I‚Äôm above median (top 40%) at a T30. I‚Äôm slightly out of BigLaw range GPA wise unless I can pull something off through 3L hiring, but I think I‚Äôm a good candidate for MidLaw. I‚Äôm worried about capping my growth and shortchanging my career trajectory if I take an offer from this firm, but at the same time the culture seems great, the practice area is perfect, and it‚Äôs a free Tax LLM (which I planned on pursuing anyway). This firm seems pretty sophisticated for a small firm, located near Silicon Valley and from what I can find on FirmProspects they work on some impressive deals. I‚Äôd be splitting summer between corporate and tax areas, both what I want to do. Realistically, I want to be able to pursue any of the following at some point in my career: 1) Big4 Tax. 2) BigLaw or Upper MidLaw 3) In-house at some sort of financial institution such as a bank for a fund. 

My questions essentially are:
1) assuming I got a Tax LLM through one of the big3 tax schools, would any of possible pursuits I listed above be realistic if I started at a firm that‚Äôs on the smaller size? 
2) what‚Äôs the opportunity cost of being at a firm of this size/nature? What kind of compensation do equity and nonequity partners pull in? What about Senior Associates?

1mk6scl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mk6scl/backcountry_car_wash_shortmedium/,Backcountry Car Wash (Short/Medium),"Jason and Jeff were driving to their friend James‚Äôs wedding. They knew each other from elementary school when they were lined up in alphabetical order; they became fast friends. The three had grown up together. They sat at lunch, played video games, made fun of each other's first cars, helped each other through breakups, and walked across the stage at graduation together. During college, they drifted apart, but after that was over, they rediscovered their friendship. It was as if some universal force brought them together to be inseparable. 



Jeff sat bleary-eyed in the driver's seat as they headed down a highway deeper into sticks. Although it was a sunny afternoon, the thick trees on either side of the road made sure that they would never know it. They were drafting behind a semi truck, but were otherwise alone on the road.



‚ÄúOdd place for a wedding. In the middle of nowhere and all.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúYou alright, Jeff?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm just kind of tired from driving. Can we switch places?‚Äù



Fortunately, a rest stop was ahead. They pulled into the parking lot about 20 minutes later so Jason could drive. Jeff also had to piss. Jason got a shitty cup of hot black coffee from a vending machine to keep him awake for the rest of the trek. Everything seemed as it should until they walked back to their car and saw a flock of geese flying overhead.



‚ÄúWhat the-‚Äú



Their eyes widened as their car was bombarded with an inordinate amount of goose shit. The entire roof of their car as well as a good portion of their windshield and hood were completely caked. Jeff, suddenly much more awake, started to panic.



‚ÄúFuck, dude! We can‚Äôt roll up to the wedding like this! What are we going to do?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe need to keep driving and make it there on time. If I see a car wash, we‚Äôll stop. If not, we can just park a little farther away. We can explain if we don't see a car wash; I‚Äôm sure people will understand. Just try to get some sleep.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow the fuck can I sleep after watching that?!‚Äù



Jason took the wheel. Jeff leaned back in the faux-leather car seat, trying his best to fall asleep. He was unable; his vision eventually rested outside the passenger window. Continuing for a full hour that felt like a year due to the smell, Jason saw an exit with a single gas station with a car wash attached.



""Hey man, wake up! I think I see a car wash.""



""I'm already awake.""



Despite not even closing his eyes, Jeff sat up and stretched as if he just had a full night's sleep. Attempting to rub the tiredness form his eyes, he looked at the car wash as they pulled off the exit. The gas station was closed. Its windows were boarded up and the lights that would usually display the price per gallon were shut off. No signs of life.



""Hey Jason, I don't think anyone's here. We should probably keep going.""



""Shouldn't we just check the car wash at least? The smell is killing me.""



""Fine. I guess it's not too far out of the way.""



Approaching the car wash seemed to confirm their suspicions. No signs of life. The car wash wasn't blocked in any way, but no lights were on.



""That sucks. I guess this stop was a waste.""



""It's alright, I'm sure we can find an-""



""Hey, what's that?""



Sticking out of the side of the car wash was a conspicuous plug laying next to an electrical outlet. It was practically begging to be plugged in. Jason got out and started walking towards it. Jeff didn't protest; he wanted the smell gone as soon as possible and didn't want the goose shit to eat away at his paint. Jason plugged it in and jumped a little when he heard the car wash spring to life.



It started with loud shrieking of metal. The rusted arms with the vertical brushes were moving- seemingly for the first time in years. As one of the arms bent at the hinge, rust and sparks showered onto the ground. After a quick spray of black liquid cleared the pipes, clean water began to shower down at the rinse area like it was supposed to. Jeff‚Äôs eyes lit up. It was actually working. He could hardly believe it. His regained hope overshadowed his sense of self-preservation.



""Dude, we can clean the car!""



""Yeah... but it looks a little dangerous. Didn't you see the sparks flying down?""



""Sparks shmarks, Jason! I don't have to pay for a new coat of paint anymore!""



""Okay, fine. You can go through the car wash, but I'll watch from outside. If anything goes wrong, I'm unplugging this thing IMMEDIATELY.""



Excitedly, Jeff got into the driver's seat and went towards the entrance. There he paid for a premium wash, and the speakers beckoned him forward. Like everyone else, he double checked that his windows were closed even though he was already sure of it. He drove in and then put his car into neutral. Jason stood in the entrance, watching carefully. A goose appeared from behind the building. It looked a little larger than normal.



At first, the car wash seemed to be working as intended. Sure, it sprayed Jeff's car down with stale water and old soap, but compared to goose shit, that was a great improvement. Some sparks flew down as the rusty vertical brush swayed toward the side of the car, but it was fairly gentle. Jeff generally felt pretty relaxed about this experience. As long as he didn't get out of his car, he wouldn't have to worry about the sparks. And after all, who would exit their car in a car wash?



More geese appeared from behind the building. Jason could barely notice it at first, but now it was obvious, these geese were significantly bigger than they were supposed to be. The plug was still between Jason and the geese, but they began approaching him. They were roughly the size of swans and had extra muscle to match. He could tell they looked hungry.



The horizontal brush was less forgiving than the vertical ones. It was like something was wrong with both the hydraulics and the sensors. It slammed on top of the hood with a great amount of force, setting off the car's alarm.  Jason heard this and turned toward Jeff, then looked back at the plug. The geese were between him and the plug, but Jason knew what had to be done. He rushed toward the outlet, but the geese intercepted him. One bit down on his hand with unusual force and others began to surround him.

  
The horizontal brush raised up again, emitting so many sparks that they resembled rock concert pyrotechnics. As Jeff frantically put his car into drive, it descended once more, breaking the windshield. Glass shattered, leaving surface level cuts all over his arms. The brush began to spin, getting soap into his wounds and flooding his car with water. Jason was already covered in blood. The geese took chunks from his arms and torso, ripping through his clothes and flesh. As he crawled toward the plug, he was no longer thinking about the wedding or how he presented himself; he had been reduced to a survival state where any type of social worry had completely evaporated. That may be why he took off his suit jacket and left some of the geese behind.

  
Stumbling to the plug, he pulled hard. The plug and the interior of the outlet were both rusted, so it was quite difficult to remove. The geese were approaching again, so he used his legs and yanked the cord out with all of his might. The car wash was powered down. As the hungry geese ate him alive, he had at least some relief knowing Jeff wouldn't be crushed by the car wash.



Jeff's car, however, was not in driving condition. Although the car wash was off, the front end of the car was trapped under the heavy hydraulics of the horizontal brush. The top of the car dented into the door, so he had to climb out of the window. He ran out to check on Jason, and saw the brutal scene. Dozens of large geese surrounded him and were devouring his carcass. Jeff backed away, then began to run. He couldn't use his car, so he felt like that was his only option. He didn't get far before the whole flock of geese swarmed him.



What was left of their bodies was discovered weeks later, when police looked at Jeff's bank statements and noticed a charge to the decommissioned car wash. An investigation of the scene revealed that the geese had found a hidden stash of methamphetamine and steroids, which caused them to be even more aggressive than usual. It was truly the weirdest case my detective friend had ever worked on. Since then, the car wash was demolished. Jeff's car was crushed. Although James is still in the process of grieving his friends, he seems to be doing okay. I'll provide any updates that I hear.",1,1754588691.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mk6r0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1mk6r0t/relief_and_understanding/,Relief and understanding,"Been lurking on here for a while, first time writing! I guess I wanted to share my story getting here. Hopefully this isn't too rambling!

I started getting POTS symptoms back at the start of 2021- while it was during COVID, we were entirely locked down, so I didn't have COIVD before this happened. Palpitations sent me to urgent care, who \*thought\* they saw something weird on an EKG (they did not), and they sent me to the ER. ER found nothing specific wrong with me, gave me hydration, and referred me to a cardiologist. The ER physician mentioned looking up POTS symptoms, and that was the first time I'd even heard of it. 

  
The cardiologist had me wear a 2 week monitor, which showed nothing besides tachycardic periods of time. He says 'you have anxiety and need to lose weight'. While both of these are true, I knew that wouldn't cause this. (Between all of the testing over the next few years, I had 2 normal 2 week monitors, several normal EKGs, and a normal echocardiogram)

I was fine for several months, but had my second flare later that year, and then another one in 2022. Each of those landed me in the ER. At that point, I got quite sick, and the HR increases were accompanied with severe stomach pain that seemed incredibly entwined. I also couldn't sleep for 2 weeks because shifting in my sleep kept giving me spikes as  well.  I had to go to a digestive diseases center, they did an endoscopy, nothing messed up so they diagnosed GERD without...whatever the extra stuff is. I did start having a raised HR while under anesthesia, which got them concerned. I got referred for a gastroparesis study, which I had to take the day after thanksgiving (that was fun lol). Ta da- I have gastroparesis. I can't tolerate reglan, but we do get me on off label mirtazapine usage to help with it, and reduce my omeprazole down from 80mg a day to 20mg, since we know GERD is secondary to gastroparesis. I ended up losing 20lbs during 2 months during my worst part of the flare, so then I have to get referred to a dietician to talk about diet. sigh. 

I finally got in with a good GP who listened to me. After the 3rd big flare, I finally get the cardiologist to listen a little bit as well, so I get put inn wait for a tilt table test, which took over a year to get into. While I waited, the cardiologist \*finally\* prescribed me beta blockers (2 doses of 10mg propranolol a day) to use as needed. I end up taking 2 daily every day, and it made life so much more bearable. I lost most of 2022 to being sick. But it was so tricky, because I had long spells where I was fine! But I'd get bad flares that'd last a while. Still, after we got my meds worked out, and I made sure I kept meals a bit smaller (been trying to do calorie counting for both weight loss and just helping make sure I don't overeat and flare my gastroparesis), things, were so much better.

End of 2023 rolls around, and I finally get my tilt table. Nothing. 'Grossly normal autonomic function'. I was doing really well around then and just had no flares. I waiting for a year and had to pay out of the ass for nothing, it felt like. I go into my cardiologist for my annual check up in summer 2024, tell him I'm trying to be better with exercise and hydration, and still have bad spells but was doing over all pretty well. He wouldn't say I had POTS, but he kept directing me to POTS resources for exercising after I told him I could take walks around the neighborhood I was great, but when I started jogging my HR would hit 150-160 on beta blockers immediately. It was this weird wink wink nudge nudge but I still felt like I couldn't say I had POTS or use resources regarding it because no one would diagnose me. 

January 2025 comes, and I get another bad flare- I had taken a walk, had a hot shower, had a big meal with oils, and then had ice cream, and was in a call where I got some social anxiety- and all those factors added up and BOOM, bad palpitations and HR up. Before this, I only had occasional vertigo/dizziness, but I'd thought it was allergies or something. I had a big dizzy spell right before the HR kicked up. We had to go to the ER again, 4th time since all of this started. Almost fainted in the line going in, they had to put me in a wheelchair until they could get me on a bed. I had an elevated d-dimer, but my imaging was fine, so that was inflammation (they did happen to see a cyst in my kidney, later imaging showed that's just a regular cyst so yay for that, plus all my kidney values are great). The ER doctors are like...yeahhhhh you probably have POTS or some sort of dysautonomia, but once again no one diagnoses me. 

Finally, I go back to my GP, who just says ""You have POTS, we are diagnosing you now. This is ridiculous"". She also upped my beta blockers to 3 doses a day so I can take 2 normally and have a 3rd for if I don't sleep well/eat a big meal/have an adult beverage/push myself too much exercising/just have a bad day. Before I had to ration if I needed an extra dosage, so that was a huge relief.

  
Since then, I've just had minor flares and secondary symptoms. I get a lot dizzier than I used to over the summer, and a lot of fatigue, but the HR is usually controlled. I can't tolerate the heat, so I have to do my gardening in the morning. I've gotten some compression socks, I'm looking into electrolytes (I'm still trying to lose weight so I don't want extra sugars, and sugar free stuff makes me sick). It's been a huge piece of mind finally getting a diagnosis and not feeling like I'm crazy or it is all in my head. It's easier learning how to start taking care of myself and prepare for things when I know how to do so, and what is going on/what to look out for. I still drink some alcohol (never more than 2-3 drinks, and I usually take an extra beta blocker that day), I still drink coffee (half-caf, 2 cups most days, 3 when I'm feeling good). I'd been off adhd meds since COVID started (I was on too high of a dosage then with a different dr), but my GP has me on 5mg of extended xr adderall, and honestly that balances well with beta blockers to make sure my BP is pretty level. Stuff is still difficult but...its also easier, and less hopeless. Yeah my body isn't sending signals properly, but also I don't feel like its this unknowable thing following me around. I'm working through all the trauma from the 4 years of uncertainty all the medical anxiety this whole mess has given me, that's rough sometimes. Good thing is that the propranolol and mirtazapine dosages, while less than what you'd take for anxiety or depression, basically are me microdosing them so it helps with my mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. 

  
Its still difficult some days to explain to people how POTS effects me, and how it isn't always regular-some days I can go out and get lunch in the sun with friends, and some days I will have a flare and feel sick. But I'm working on my skills with self-advocacy as well!

One issue that came up frequently is that rigid Zero-Based Budgeting makes it seem impossible to manage variable expenses (such as fluctuating rent or fluctuating utilities). You wind up needing a buffer that is ""unallocated"" or defending each coffee.

People employ various strategies, based on what I've observed in the comments:

Setting aside the maximum amount for expenses and transferring any remaining funds to savings or a sinking fund (also known as a buffer)

""Extra"" categories or rollover buffers that continue into the following month

Using savings to cover unforeseen expenses and averaging variable costs


What I'm interested in is this:

1. Do you account for the highest possible cost in your budget? What happens to the leftover money if your bill is lower?
2. Do you employ rolling categories or ""sinking funds"" to offset the swings? How are they named and used?
3. Or do you simply say ""whatever's left is free money"" after rounding up estimates?

We would all be happy to learn from your best practices, so please share what works for you without passing judgment.",3,1754588532.0,MiddleClassFinance,7,1.0,False

Designed to brew rich and flavorful coffee with an old-school charm, it offers several contemporary features for added utility. With my growing family of coffee enthusiasts, we put this coffee maker through its paces every day, experimenting with all its functions, and here's my honest take on it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stands out is the stainless steel exterior‚Äîsleek, shiny, and durable. This isn‚Äôt one of those appliances that feel flimsy or cheap. The body, lid, and even the filter basket are made from high-quality food-grade 18/8 stainless steel, which feels solid to the touch. Plus, everything about the materials screams longevity. While the borosilicate glass knob on top adds a charming retro touch, it‚Äôs also functional; I could watch the coffee bubble up as it brewed, which was oddly satisfying. The cool-touch handle and non-drip spout are excellent additions, preventing any accidental burns or unwanted mess during pouring. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit anywhere on my kitchen counter but large enough to brew up to 12 cups at a time‚Äîperfect for both my morning solo brew and family gatherings.  

**Convenience Features**  
I love the thoughtfulness behind the design. The on/off switch is simple yet effective; no touchscreens or confusing buttons. There‚Äôs also a bright indicator light that shows when the coffee‚Äôs done. The automatic keep-warm function is a lifesaver, especially during busy mornings when everyone‚Äôs on a different coffee schedule. I‚Äôve noticed there‚Äôs no significant bitterness, even after the coffee stays warm for an hour.

**Advantages**  
The appliance has genuinely delighted me in several areas:  
- **Fast Brewing:** This thing doesn‚Äôt waste time; it consistently brews anywhere from 6 to 12 cups in a jiffy without compromising flavor.  
- **No Plastic:** There‚Äôs no contact between hot coffee and plastic parts, which makes me feel much better about what I‚Äôm drinking.  
- **Effortless Cleaning:** Thanks to its stainless steel finish, cleanup is a breeze, and there‚Äôs no risk of residual odors clinging to the material.  
- **Heat-Resistant Knob and Drip-Free Spout:** Small details like these make the percolator safer and cleaner to use.

**Critiques**  
However, it‚Äôs not all sunshine and roses, as a few quirks stood out during usage:  
- **Outdated Power Plug:** I wish it had a detachable cord or an updated ergonomic plug. It feels a bit dated compared to modern appliances.  
- **Heavy Weight:** At nearly 3.73 pounds, it‚Äôs not the lightest setup, so carrying it around during gatherings can be cumbersome.  
- **Glass Knob Durability:** Although visually appealing, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that the glass knob might not survive a drop.  

**Ease of Use**  
For someone like my dad, who still hasn‚Äôt fully embraced cutting-edge tech, this machine is a dream. No app setups, no unnecessary beeps‚Äîjust place the coffee grounds, add the water, turn it on, and watch as it turns out piping hot coffee in minutes. For me, the simplicity brought back memories of my grandmother‚Äôs old percolator, but with modern upgrades like the automatic keep-warm function.  

**Other Competing Products**  
In comparing this model to others, like the Presto 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker or the Farberware Classic Yosemite Percolator, a few differences become obvious. The Presto is quicker to brew but lacks the clarity offered by the borosilicate glass knob. Meanwhile, the Farberware excels in portability but doesn‚Äôt match APOXCON‚Äôs safety credentials, such as its ETL certification. APOXCON feels like it pays more attention to the finer details, with its better spill prevention and cool-touch handle, making it friendlier for multi-generational households like mine.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Given the thoughtful engineering, durable materials, and added safety features, I‚Äôd say this coffee percolator offers significant bang for the buck. A lot of high-quality coffee makers charge far more without delivering the charm, simplicity, and effectiveness found here. Whether you need a daily caffeine boost or a crowd-pleaser during gatherings, this appliance delivers without feeling like you‚Äôve overspent.

1mk6nry,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustyconsumer/comments/1mk6nry/explore_the_maguja_rn032a_blood_pressure_monitor/,Explore the maguja RN-032A Blood Pressure Monitor Review Does It Meet Expectations?,"Testing the maguja RN-032A Arm Blood Pressure Monitor was an engaging experience, especially given its compactness and straightforward operation. As someone who tries to keep health tracking as hassle-free as possible, this monitor caught my attention right away. Automatic, user-friendly, and suited for home use, it‚Äôs marketed for everyday adults looking for accessible health monitoring at their convenience. While I was pleased with many aspects of it, a few things left me scratching my head. Let‚Äôs dive into the details.

**Design and Build Quality**

The monitor has an off-white, sleek design that doesn‚Äôt feel intrusive when placed on your table or nightstand. It‚Äôs lightweight at just over 15 ounces, and its size (3.94 x 3.94 x 3.94 inches) makes it a portable choice for those needing mobility. The 8.66‚Äì16.54-inch blood pressure cuff it comes with is incredibly versatile, fitting a range of arm sizes. The durability of the material impressed me‚Äîit feels sturdy and long-lasting. I found the included storage bag handy too. Taking it to my dad‚Äôs house, the device was easy to pack and carry, which added to its practicality.

**Functionality and Features**

Using this monitor was refreshingly simple. The single-button operation is a godsend for people who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy‚Äîor, like me, simply don‚Äôt want to deal with overly complicated setups. It automatically inflates the cuff, measures systolic and diastolic pressure, and displays pulse rate. The average value measurement is a standout feature. It calculates the last three readings automatically, which helped me get a broader view of my fluctuating pressure levels after that third cup of coffee.

[Ready to buy maguja RN-032A? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://thepressureexperts.com/link/b0bg84bv9q/)

**Memory Feature and Multi-User Capability**

Another feature that stood out while testing is the ability to store data for up to two users, with 60 records each. This memory function proved valuable for my household, where my spouse and I both track our blood pressure regularly. Recalling past readings and identifying trends made it easier to discuss our concerns with our doctor during a visit. My mom, an avid user of traditional monitors, was initially skeptical but ended up appreciating this digital feature‚Äîshe even asked me to set it up for her while visiting.

**Positives**

There are several upsides to this blood pressure monitor, making it suitable for everyday use:

- Simple one-button operation makes it user-friendly, even for beginners.
- Portability ensures you can take it on trips or when visiting family.
- Memory function caters to two users with substantial storage space (120 readings).
- Average value feature helps provide more comprehensive health insights.

**Weaknesses**

However, no product comes without its limitations, and this one is no exception:

- The display, while functional, could benefit from a larger font for elder users or those with poor eyesight.
- The cuff, though versatile, can feel a little unwieldy when used on thinner arms.
- Lacks advanced connectivity features to sync with a smartphone, a feature becoming standard in many similar devices.

**Product Rivals**

In terms of alternatives, other popular monitors in this category include Omron‚Äôs automatic blood pressure monitors and Withings devices. Omron offers a more established brand, with some models integrating smartphone syncing and app functionalities. However, they tend to be bulkier and pricier. Withings, on the other hand, features a sleek design and modern connectivity options, but its focus on high-end users makes it less accessible for casual users or beginners. Where the maguja RN-032A stands out is its simplicity and budget-friendliness, particularly for individuals or households just entering the health-monitoring space.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

The product provides a solid balance between affordability and essential features. Its straightforwardness is its strength and differentiating factor, particularly for families or older adults who value ease of use over flashy tech. Despite lacking advanced functionalities like Bluetooth integration, the built-in features already cover key user needs. It‚Äôs an ideal pick for someone looking to get accurate results without spending a fortune.

Looking for some advice. 

Myself and my Husband have been married for two years but together for 12, I love him with all my heart but since having our 6 month old we are falling out a lot more. 

He is a brilliant Dad, very hands on and our daughter and pets love him very much. Our daughter is FF and during the newborn trenches he would take a night on the weekend so I could get a break. 

He is a good guy but right now I feel like we argue over the most basic things! For context we are in the UK and he works for an American company (work from home), so does quite a few late nights and sometimes very early morning. 

I was very tired this week as baby has a cold, is teething and being very whingy and hard work. I have done the bedtime routine for the last 4 nights (we normally alternate) he offered to have her for the night shift and get up if needed (she normally sleeps through, might stir once or twice) and for the morning. 

She pretty much slept through, he got up once or twice and in the morning he changed her nappy and tried giving her a bottle but she wasn't interested (normal for her). He made me a coffee, I then made breakfast pancakes for us all and he played with her while I was cooking- after breakfast she started getting a bit whingy in her highchair as her morning nap was near and he went to have a shower so I put her down for her nap which is tricky as she is in a stage of fighting it and I usually feed to sleep right now. 

I expressed my disappointment that I don't really feel like he did a morning shift as I did the most tricky part. 

We did go out for a nice dog walk to our local pet shop so it did get all forgotten about as we had some family time. 

In the afternoon he had 2-3pm free before going into meetings until 8. At 2 I started an early dinner and asked if he could put the baby in her seat and he have his laptop downstairs to watch her while I cooked, he said he would go get his laptop but never came back down, he did come down for 30 seconds to put a code into his new game then went back up. 

When I started dishing up and doing final bits, I shouted up to him that I needed his help and he said hang on, a few minutes passed and I said it again. 

We then had a fight that I only had to wait for him for a few minutes when I shouted, but my point was that he said he would come down and occupy her... He did agree that he got caught up in work but he makes me feel like I'm in the wrong for needing him. 

We just seem be having fights like this all the time... We have agreed we are going to look at his work calender on Sunday and book at times we can have family time and when he can have our baby as I don't normally get a break until after bedtime, right now I feel like he comes down from his office on the occasional here and there to see her but never really has her at her tricky points or for a long period of time unless I actually go out to do something with friends which has happened three times and one event was a funeral.

He also isn't always working upstairs, he is obviously working the majority but he does have downtime when he plays chess watches youtube etc. 

Honest opinions - am I being unreasonable? He is the one working and I'm currently not as on mat leave so maybe I'm expecting to much? 

Is this normal when having a baby and the adjustment period? It would be great to know other experiences.

**Jinx! (8/7/25)**

You ever hear how you can put things out into the universe? Or how you can open a can of worms? Maybe even be tempted with Pandora's box? Well the universe must follow this thread. She read my post about having a drama free few months and said, 'hold my beer'. Not 24 hours after I wrote the last post did I get a ping on my phone and a text from my ex. The message was as follows, ""*Hey- I've been putting this off for too long. I really thought I would have something by now. I was laid off from the new job in June. I was ashamed and embarrassed with how it happened and lied to you. It was selfish not to tell you and I regret it. I'm working with the state to get things squared away. I really screwed all of this up and I apologize.""* This explain so much. I knew something was up with him. The crying at the airport was the icing on the cake. I walk over to my boyfriend, phone in hand. I let him read the text. He gets to the 3rd sentence, furrows his brow and shakes his head. ""This man doesn't make it easy, does he?"" No he doesn't, babe. Listen, I'm not mad he lost that job. That happens. People lose their jobs everyday and there is nothing to be ashamed of. But it's the lying. Was this an attempt to salvage his image? I mean, I already think he is a train wreck. A job isn't going to improve my opinion of him. But I think what really gets me is how he accused me for years at being terrible at communicating. He was always the one hiding things and withholding but yet I couldn't communicate. I read convos with the AP where he said I didn't know how to have a conversation and I had poor communication skills. Was all that talk just gaslighting? Yes. Was that reflecting? Also yes. I know all that now but I was so blind to it then. Oh, what a silly girl I was.

The next day I am at football practice. My little guy is blowing the dust off his helmet and is getting ready for another season of pee wee football. I chat with the football moms and enjoy watching the boys as the sun sets. My phone rings. I expect a telemarketer or someone telling me I owe the IRS boats loads of money, but even worse, it's my ex. I excuse myself an take the call. I assume this conversation is about his job. I get the jump on him and explain how losing your job isn't something to be ashamed of. He needs to be upfront with me...no more lying...communicate better..etc. He agrees to all but his tone is rushed. I'm sure he hates to admit he was wrong. No one likes to be scolded. He takes the first break in the conversation to switch topics. Now I thought I have done a pretty good job over the years to remain anonymous in my posts. But some of you are excellent armchair detectives and you have been able to sniff out what state I am in. Well, the AG in my state said enough is enough and is holding all the baby daddies financially responsible. I thought this was all just chatter on social media but to my surprise it isn't. My ex tells me that the state just cleaned out his 401K. All his retirement savings from his last job is gone. But, that wasn't enough to cover his arrears. So they seized all the money in his joint savings account with his AP/fiancee. HA! HA HA HA! HA! This is such delicious revenge. I couldn't ask for anything better. Best part is I didn't have to do anything AND he can't do anything about it.

I don't know where this conversation is going. How do you end this? ""Sucks to be you thanks for the cash. Bye!"" As he speaks I can here his voice start to crack. Oh no. Here comes the break down. For a man who was really tough during his affair and divorce he really is a big baby now. I make the mistake of asking if he has been going to therapy. He reminds me that he can't afford it. I ask why his fiancee isn't helping him pay for therapy. I know if the man I loved needed it I'd make sure he got the help. That what decent people do, right? Guess the key word here is decent. He proceeds to spill all the tea about his fiancee. He goes on to tell me about how often they have been fighting, her lack of support, and how he doesn't feel like a part of her life. He complained that he doesn't feel like himself, he just conformed to her life and has no identity anymore. He said it's more than likely over and is considering a move back here. He seems to be at pease with tossing away the relationship and heading back. I'm at a loss as to what I should say. I'm trying to stay neutral but still sip that delicious tea. I suggested he look into therapy again and talk to her about how he feels. Then he says it, ""she doesn't know how to communicate properly'. It's a gut punch. All the air has been sucked out of me. I'm instantly bought back to all the times he claimed I was the poor communicator. It's the same situation. I imagine he had this same conversations with her 5 years ago about me. Playing the victim, the good guy who can't get a break all to win sympathy. I take a second to remember who he is; a liar. I wish him luck and hurry off the phone.

That night, I had a dream that I was on a road trip in Southern California (I don't live there but have been many times) with a girl I didn't recognize.

In my dream she was digging through a bag of necklace charms and kept pulling out a gold needle, joking that it would be the perfect charm. I thought it was so funny in my dream, because a needle is so dangerous to wear on your body. There was also symbolism of a key in the dream. Context for that may be that I was debating on whether to use a key during my spell.

Then, just now, in real life, I stopped by a coffee shop I had never been in before and the owner/barista was behind the counter.

He asked if I wanted to do something spontaneous and get a piercing. A helix, to be exact. I didn't realize the coffee shop was connected to both a tattoo + piercing shop. This feels on the nose because of the needle point mentioned in my dream.

Another strange detail. I asked for a vanilla latte, and he told me to taste it to see if I liked it. I tried it and it tasted like cinnamon, an ingredient I used prominently in the spell. The barista confirmed their vanilla latte includes Mexican cinnamon‚ÄîA version I‚Äôd never had before. Interestingly enough, his name was Malice, but he was super nice and genuine.

What could this all mean?

Since I did the road opener, I honestly have felt like things are working out for me quite a bit after having a rough last couple of years. I‚Äôd love feedback on dream interpretation.

# Best Area Rug: Rust Color [2025 Top Picks]

Area rugs are essential components of interior design that add warmth, texture, and personality to any space. They serve as focal points, define areas within a room, and contribute significantly to the overall aesthetic. A rust-colored area rug, in particular, brings a touch of earthy sophistication and can complement a wide range of d√©cor styles, from bohemian to modern. Selecting the right area rug requires careful consideration of factors such as material,size,design,and durability.

**Material and Weave:**
The ideal rust-colored area rug should possess high-quality materials and weave craftsmanship. many top picks for 2025 incorporate a blend of natural and synthetic fibers to achieve the optimal balance of comfort, durability, and ease of maintenance. Wool rugs, known for their resilience and soft texture, are a popular choice for high-traffic areas.Synthetic options,such as polypropylene and polyester,offer stain resistance and affordability,making them suitable for households with children or pets.

High-quality materials ensure longevity. Area rugs are intended to withstand the rigors of daily traffic and maintain their color saturation intact. Stain-resistant piles, reinforced edges, and fade-resistant dyes are crucial. Many of these rugs feature low-pile constructions to easily clean up messes. Rugs that are easy to maintain reduce the amount of time spent on cleaning.

**Color Fastness and UV resistance:**
The best area rugs do not fade over time. Exposure to sunlight can be a significant concern, particularly in rooms with large windows. Top-performing area rugs will incorporate high-quality dyes that resist fading when exposed to UV radiation. This ensures that the rust color remains vibrant and true over time. UV resistance is particularly important for warmer climates,were sunlight exposure is more intense.

**Eco-Friendliness and Sustainability:**
Consumers frequently request rugs that are environmentally-conscious. Eco-kind practices are prioritized increasingly in the manufacturing of rugs. Manufacturers are moving towards reusable packaging and materials. The industry is also exploring lasting materials like recycled polyester and organic cotton.

This creates a welcoming interior aesthetic. Rust-colored rugs pair well with both neutral palettes, such as grays and beiges, and bolder color schemes featuring blues, greens, or yellows. For example, a rust rug in a living room with gray walls and navy accents can tie the entire space together cohesively.

**Improved Comfort and Warmth:** Area rugs create warm and cozy spaces. A soft,plush rug feels luxurious underfoot and provides insulation in colder climates. This is beneficial during winter, making the room seem warmer, cozy, and inviting. This is especially noticeable on hard floors,such as tile or hardwood. Rust offers a welcoming tone, adding to the appeal.

Noise reduction is an critically important factor in apartments, home offices, and media rooms. A rust-colored area rug in a living room can minimize noise from foot traffic and television sounds, thus enhancing the overall comfort.

**Protection of Flooring:** A good area rug also preserves flooring. They protect hard floors from scratches, dents, and general wear and tear. Rugs are a useful layer of protection for hardwood, tile, and laminate floors, therefore helping to maintain their beauty and extend their longevity. A well-placed rust-colored area rug in a high-traffic zone can prevent these damages.

**Versatile Decor Integration:** Rust works very well. Rust area rugs can enhance a diverse variety of decor styles, from conventional to transitional to contemporary. they incorporate well with bohemian, or industrial aesthetics. A rust hue can complement an elaborate and rustic piece if it is displayed near said piece.## FAQs Section

**What size rug is best for my living room?**
Selecting the correct rug sizing for your living room usually hinges upon your room layout and furniture arrangement. A prevalent strategy involves choosing a rug that positions all front legs of your seating furniture upon it, fostering a coherent and visually pleasant aesthetic. For compact spaces, a smaller rug centered beneath the coffee table can effectively delineate the area. Accurate dimensions of both the room and your furniture offer invaluable direction, and measuring or utilizing painter's tape to define prospective sizes can aid in the visualization.

**How do I clean a rust-colored rug effectively?**
Optimal cleaning techniques hinge upon the rug's constituent material. Typically, a routine vacuuming regimen is essential to eliminate rubble and dirt accumulation. For more thorough cleaning procedures, a delicate detergent specific to rugs is endorsed. Stay away from harsh chemicals, as their presence may cause discoloration.Spot cleanup should be dealt with promptly using a moist towel and mild soap combo. In cases of stubborn stains, it might prove necessary to consult a professional rug cleaner. Check the rug's care guidelines frequently for recommendations.

**Will a rust-colored rug fade in sunlight?**
This is dependent. Rugs produced using fade-resistant dyes, like those crafted from top-tier wool or synthetic fibers, exhibit a greater capacity to withstand fading. If your rug is positioned in an area with plentiful sunshine, contemplate using curtains or blinds to filter ultraviolet rays. Rotating the rug periodically can likewise encourage even exposure and mitigate the likelihood of fading in any particular segment. Continuously inspect your model's packaging for UV rating.

**Are rust-colored rugs suitable for high-traffic areas?**
Whether rust-colored rugs are right for high-traffic zones hinges in part upon the material. Rugs produced using durable fibers like wool or polypropylene possess a capacity to resist wear and tear. Opting for rugs boasting tight weaves or low heaps is usually beneficial, as these exhibit a predisposition toward less grime. furthermore,utilizing rug pads lends enhanced protection and averts slippage,which makes sure the rug remains firmly placed and lasts.

1mk6ho2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1mk6ho2/discover_if_the_best_masticating_juicer_from/,Discover if the best masticating juicer from Omega lives up to the hype,"Testing the Omega NC900HRD19 masticating juicer has been both a rewarding experience and an eye-opener to the world of healthier living. I never knew how much of a difference a top-tier juicer could make until this machine landed on my kitchen counter. This premium juicer is beautifully manufactured by Omega, and it's safe to say that it brings a new level of functionality and convenience to the juicing game. While I was impressed with many features of this product, there were also a few details to keep in mind.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This device is an absolute beauty. The sleek red finish adds a dash of modern sophistication to any kitchen, and with dimensions measuring at 19.22"" x 7.25"" x 12.96"", it feels solid without occupying an unreasonable amount of counter space. At nearly 19 pounds, it‚Äôs surprisingly heavy, but I appreciate this because it means the juicer is solidly built and won‚Äôt bounce around during use. The manual design requires handwashing, which may discourage those who rely on dishwashers, but it does promote longevity since delicate parts are less likely to be damaged over time. Its uncoated finish and durable material from stainless steel enhance both aesthetic appeal and sturdiness.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
This masticating juicer performs like an absolute beast. Operating at just 80 RPM, it minimizes heat buildup and oxidation, maintaining the freshness and nutritional value of the juice. I've tested it on everything from leafy greens, like kale and spinach, to tougher fruits and vegetables, such as apples and carrots. Every time, it extracted juice with remarkable efficiency. My favorite feature? The juice lasts much longer when stored because it doesn‚Äôt oxidize as quickly. The five adjustable pressure settings allow me to customize depending on what I‚Äôm juicing, which means my wheatgrass shots in the morning come out smooth and rich.

**Want the Omega NC900HRD19 juicer? [Check its price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b09ffxrblb/)**  

**Key Benefits**  
- Minimal heat and oxidation preserve nutrients.  
- 5 adjustable pressure settings optimize juice extraction.  
- Multi-function design for baby food, nut butter, and pasta.  

**Functionality Beyond Juicing**  
The machine is more than just a juicer; it's practically an all-in-one nutrition system. On a whim, I tested its ability to create natural nut butters and even almond milk. I also used it to grind coffee beans, mince some garlic for a recipe, and whip up vibrant, fresh pesto. It included six nozzles and two juicing screens, which made these extra functions possible. The pasta attachment was a pleasant surprise as well‚ÄîI successfully made some homemade spaghetti. Its versatility certainly sets it apart from some other juicers I‚Äôve tried in the past. 

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Getting started was straightforward because all components of the juicer are intuitive to assemble. The larger feed chute, compared to other Omega variants, means I spend less time chopping ingredients. This simplicity is ideal for busy mornings when I just want fresh juice without fuss. Cleanup, while a bit time-consuming due to the hand-wash requirement, is quite manageable if done immediately after juicing. Pro tip: Rinse it under running water right after use to make the process even quicker.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The manual cleaning process can be tedious for some users.  
- It operates quietly, but there‚Äôs still some noise during denser extractions.  
- Larger fruits usually require some pre-cutting despite the wider feed chute.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to centrifugal juicers, there‚Äôs really no contest when it comes to juice quality and shelf life. The clear rival here is the Hurom H-AA, which I‚Äôve also had the chance to use briefly. Both products are excellent when it comes to slower juicing methods and nutrient retention, but the Omega model takes the lead in versatility. That pasta and nut butter feature is a dream for multitaskers and food enthusiasts. On the downside, the Hurom is sleeker and quieter, which might appeal to those with modern kitchen setups or shared living spaces.

**Bang for the Buck**  
While it‚Äôs priced in the premium range, the Omega NC900HRD19 justifies its cost through unparalleled functionality and durability. You're not only investing in a juicer but in a complete nutrition system that handles tasks you‚Äôd usually need separate devices for. I‚Äôve saved both time and money by avoiding store-bought almond milk and baby food. Considering the 15-year warranty on parts and performance, I truly believe this machine offers excellent value for money in the long run.

It‚Äôs honestly way too long for me to ask you to read it, but I‚Äôm still going to. Any insights are very much appreciated. I have my own ideas, but I still go back and forth between the same few types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Section 1**
*1.	How do you work? Why do people go to work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not? What are they?*

I prefer working towards concrete goals. I don‚Äôt say to myself work X hours today, but rather I give myself a goal, (write this many words, finish this chapter, reply to these emails) and if I‚Äôm finished, I‚Äôm finished. Sometimes it takes 2 hours, sometimes it takes 12, but that works for me. I thrive without a routine, and even if I procrastinate a lot, I never miss a deadline.

Why do people work? Lots of reasons. Being able to pay rent, to stave off boredom, to avoid being alone with your thoughts, for recognition and applause, to fulfil some sort of social obligation, to prove something to their unloving parents, and (for the lucky few) actual personal fulfillment. Most of these reasons suck though, and reveal more about how many people live life according to outside expectations. Paying rent, fulfillment and staving off boredom are the only good reasons imo. I‚Äôve been unemployed before. That shit sucks. Even though I could pay my rent with the savings I had, the days started melting into one another in a way I absolutely hated. I have a job now, and it's fine, but in the end I want something with a bit more of a challenge.


*2.	How do you determine the quality of work? How do you determine the quality of a purchase? Do you pay any attention to it?*

I review my own work as an outsider. If I were my own boss, would I be happy with this? For purchases, it‚Äôs research and reviews at first, and experimenting after. I need to see it myself to believe it. 

For example, haircare. I tested out lots of different shampoos that were supposedly better for my hairtype, according to online forums. But in some cases it barely did anything justifying the price, or it only made things worse. A lot of things are taken as gospel truth in online communities without a slightest hint of self-evaluation. Still, once in a while you find someone who actually knows what they‚Äôre talking about and that‚Äôs incredibly valuable.



*3.	There is a professional next to you. How do you know they are a professional? How do you evaluate their skill?*

Confidence backed up by results. You know bluster when you see it, but all actual professionals are confident in their skills and insightful in how to use them. It isn‚Äôt only about applying, but in seeing more than a rookie. Actually understanding their subject in a manner that screams that they aren‚Äôt merely regurgitating what they have learned elsewhere. I see a lot of people in academia who confuse knowledge for intelligence, thinking that if they pass off someone else‚Äôs insights as their own that others will see them as smart. Some might, but that‚Äôs something that you must learn to see through. The true professionals are the ones able to make a change, not just apply the thoughts of others.


*4.	If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that? Do you know if your performance is better or worse than others?*

I either stop completely and forget about it or I repeatedly bash my head against the wall until I can do it. Just doing it and trying is the best way to learn. I think I can evaluate my own performance pretty well, and (if I care enough) I will just keep failing until I don‚Äôt fail anymore. The challenge can be fun, and I don‚Äôt mind failing.

Sometimes I think something‚Äôs just boring though, and if I don‚Äôt really care for the result as well I can‚Äôt see any reason why I would waste my time on it.


*5.	How do you measure the success of a job? What standard do you use? Do you pay attention to it? When should you deviate from this standard?*

I ask myself ‚Äúwhat is our end goal and did I bring us closer to it?‚Äù. I don‚Äôt really care about profit for its own sake, so the goals are more about the service or social good we provide. Still, I‚Äôm a strategic person and understand that the financial health of the organization can help provide more of this social good in the long-term, though I still can‚Äôt give too much of a shit about a bit of wasteful spending. Team morale is important as well, and constantly pushing for the highest efficiency can be a real downer. Following the protocol to the letter also isn‚Äôt needed at all times, and a bit of flexibility is a good thing (until it brings you into legal trouble). I also just think endless safeguards and backups can be stifling.

So yeah, that‚Äôs my standard, and I do generally try to maximize my impact. I only deviate from this standard when it starts impacting other facets of my life. For example, I will certainly voice my thoughts to my boss, but if in the end I need to do something I think is dumb and counterproductive I will just do it without much of a fuss. No use in losing my job over minor disagreements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Section 2**
*1.	What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?*

Anything is a whole if you‚Äôre brave enough. Is a keyboard ‚Äòa whole‚Äô or is it part of a desk setup? And if it's a part then what is an individual key? It could also be its own whole, with the lettering and the base as its parts. This is a language game with little to no relevance to how things actually are. To be honest, I don‚Äôt really get the point of this question. Reality doesn‚Äôt care what we call it.


*2.	What does ‚Äúlogical‚Äù mean? What is your understanding? Do you think that it correlates with the common view? How do you know you are being logical?*

Logic is just the internal self-consistency of a system. Something can be logical but wrong if it doesn‚Äôt match with reality. Logic is still important, I could never believe in a system with glaring contradictions, but you need to check your fundamental assumptions first and not get lost in anything that obscures the underlying truth. The system describes reality, it is not reality. When the two conflict, your system is wrong.

You also can‚Äôt profess to believe in logic and ignore your own emotions. People who self-identify as ‚Äòpurely rational‚Äô are the worst at this. Thinking that they only use logical reasoning for their decisions while ignoring all of the emotions that went into forming the worldview that that decision was based on. If you‚Äôve watched Death Note, Light Yagami was the fucking worst. 

I have a similar disdain for philosophers or debate bros, who mostly just trap people in inconsistencies in language rather than engaging with the idea that language is meant to communicate. Logic is only important for the latter, but most people confuse it for the former. So yeah, I like logic, I‚Äôm good at using it, but some people misuse it. The shadows on the cave wall aren‚Äôt real guys, don‚Äôt treat them like they are.


*3.	What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.*

Hierarchy is a tool, and a very useful one at that. In the nicest way possible, most people struggle making decisions for themselves, and want some sort of outside guidance. Political hierarchies, corporate hierarchies, social hierarchies, they‚Äôre unavoidable (especially that last one). If they‚Äôre unavoidable the only alternative to following is leading. You see this a lot in countercultural social groups, where people who reject the hierarchy of mainstream society recreate micro-hierarchies with their own thought leaders and followers.

In the end, things are impossible to organize without some sort of hierarchy, without the decision-makers and the ones who execute those decisions. That doesn‚Äôt mean you always need to obey though, because there are a lot of absolutely moronic middle managers out there who couldn‚Äôt make a good decision if their lives depended on it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that hierarchy itself is bad. Society couldn‚Äôt function without it. You just need to make sure that the hierarchy stays dynamic. Burn it down every once in a while so that its entrenched elite gets thrown down to the ground and has to earn their position.


*4.	What is classification? How does classification work? Why is it needed and where is it applied? Give examples.*

Sorting things into groups based on shared characteristics. Sometimes those characteristics are abstract, sometimes directly observable. It is mostly useful because of our human psyche, giving us shortcuts to quickly evaluate people and things. Socionics is one such system, and it can be very useful as long as you don‚Äôt fall in the trap of trying to force a complex reality to fit simplified categories. I think it‚Äôs sad that some people, after getting typed, start acting like a stereotypical image of that type rather than living life as their own complex selves.


*5.	Are your ideas consistent? How do you know they are consistent? How do you spot inconsistency in others‚Äô ideas?*

I try to, and I‚Äôm not afraid to change my beliefs for the sake of intellectual honesty. For example, I believe that morality is socially defined, but I also believe that we should prevent people from doing genocide. So, in a discussion with a christian friend of mine (who tried to convince me of universal morality) I just flat-out told him that I believe it‚Äôs okay to force subjective beliefs about morality on other people. It doesn‚Äôt sound very nice, but that was the best way to reconcile these two beliefs in my eyes. That‚Äôs what everybody does anyway, they‚Äôre just in denial about it.

Still, a person has so many beliefs that it‚Äôs impossible to be totally consistent. Hypocrisy is the human condition, and I‚Äôve accepted that. I won‚Äôt agonize over my own beliefs just to create the perfect system. You just have to live your life, and if you remain honest with yourself and open to being challenged by others, you will slowly get more consistent in your worldview. The easiest time to notice inconsistencies is when you have to verbalize them. Thus, also this questionnaire.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Section 3**
*1.	Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?*

Just ask? Most people say yes, and if they don‚Äôt you can probably find a compromise. Framing helps, and knowing how to bring your request in the right way can be essential. You can see that as manipulative, but who cares? If I want a raise I‚Äôll market myself with ease, and if they say no, no harm done. That‚Äôs just honesty. Just don‚Äôt be an asshole, be yourself (and thereby a bit memorable) and people will generally be well-disposed to give you what you ask for. If you treat people charitably and with respect, most will respect you too.


*2.	How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?*

I just keep going. I don‚Äôt always get what I want, but I don‚Äôt wanna wait and hope for something to just fall in my lap, so I always try something. If it fails, try again. Don‚Äôt give up quickly, but be ready to move on if it really isn‚Äôt gonna happen. To give an example (I like examples): I don‚Äôt get crushes often, but two people who I was madly in love with (who didn‚Äôt reciprocate that feeling) are still great friends years later. Just because I knew I tried, and could then move on to something more platonic.


*3.	How do you deal with opposition? What methods do you use to defend your interests?*

If it‚Äôs people opposing me, just convince them not to. They don‚Äôt have to agree with everything I do, but if after an honest conversation and attempt at persuasion they still oppose me, I will just find ways to minimize the effect of their opposition (i.e. work around them or undermine their power over me). If they can be ignored, even better. Threats can also work, such as threatening to leave a job if they don‚Äôt give you that promotion. I always do it diplomatically though. Physicality is only something I only do in very specific situations (such as getting people to stop harassing my friends when in the club or something), but since I‚Äôm very tall and relatively muscular, I‚Äôve never gotten in an actual fight in my adult life. People just back down.

If it‚Äôs material opposition, same thing, just try and find a solution. The strategy depends on the problem.


*4.	When do you think it‚Äôs ok to occupy someone‚Äôs space? Do you recognize it?*

I have my space, you have yours. It‚Äôs great if we can share it, but some places are just for me and I respect it if you feel the same. I trust in the people around me to tell me when they think I‚Äôm intruding, and otherwise I can probably pick it up through their body language. I do think most people overestimate how bad others think their intrusions are. You don‚Äôt need to be overly sensitive about it, most people are more than happy to accommodate you.

In public settings, however, all bets are off. I don‚Äôt mind it at all if I don‚Äôt totally fit in with a group of strangers. There is always some common ground to be found, or we can just respect the ways in which we are who we are. Also, I won‚Äôt stand in public transport if there‚Äôs a seat available next to another group. I‚Äôll just ask you to get your bag off of that chair so I can sit. It‚Äôs not the end of the world.


*5.	Do others think you are a strong-willed person? Do you think you have a strong will?*

I believe so. I have been called ‚Äòstable‚Äô quite often, but I feel that stability is also a form of willpower. I personally think unflappable is a better descriptor, as I‚Äôm not a homebody or bound to any routine, and often pretty impulsive. I just don‚Äôt get stressed or scared in most situations. I have a high tolerance for pain, and don‚Äôt even really avoid it in some cases for the sake of challenging my own willpower. A friend jokingly called me ‚Äòdelulu‚Äô about my optimism when I was applying to some very competitive positions. She meant it as a compliment, I think. ‚ÄòStubborn‚Äô has also been used a lot, but that is more because I won‚Äôt back down if I believe I‚Äôm right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Section 4**
*1.	How do you satisfy your physical senses? What examples can you give? What physical experiences are you drawn to?*

Yeah. I like food, drugs, smoking, casual sex, drinking and all that stuff in excess. At the same time, I don‚Äôt easily get addicted and have also done restrictive diets with relative ease. Same with drugs, drinking or smoking. I can not touch a cig for months and then smoke a pack in a weekend at a music festival, and forget about it after. I just dislike moderation. If I want something, I want all of it. I‚Äôll deal with the consequences later, most often through periods of abstaining.

Also, though I can clearly notice the difference between low and high quality goods, I am not picky. Just because I prefer a fresh stone-baked neapolitan pizza, that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt also really enjoy a greasy-ass 2 buck frozen pizza from the supermarket.


*2.	 How do you find harmony with your environment? How do you build a harmonious environment? What happens if this harmony is disturbed?*

Harmony can only be there if no one feels held back. Perfect harmony is achieved when everybody can say everything, and everybody can respond to that, and no one takes it personally. However, that is almost impossible and requires a lot of emotional intelligence from all parties involved. Sometimes people just don‚Äôt want to hear something, and it‚Äôs a moment to moment decision if you need to shut up or you need to push through. Don‚Äôt avoid conflict though. That breeds resentment. I am good at not being offended, so I welcome anybody to try and voice their problems with me. That‚Äôs the only way to move forward.


*3.	What does comfort mean to you? How do you create it?*

Comfort is great, and I don‚Äôt struggle that much with relaxing. However, I don‚Äôt always need to be comfortable. Sometimes the very fact that I‚Äôm most definitely not comfortable is enjoyable. Cycling through a storm, waking up hungover in a tent or dancing till I have blisters, those things make me feel more alive than a calm comfort. Even things that suck in the moment can be funny if you take a bit of a bird‚Äôs eye view, like having a bad psychedelic trip. Everything awful is at least a tiny bit funny.


*4.	How do you express yourself in your hobbies? How do you engage yourself with those things?*

I like fashion, but I never feel like I get things exactly as I want (mostly because I‚Äôm too broke for my tastes). I also play D&D, and when playing I like to act out archetypes that reflect a characteristic I see in myself (to an extent what all actors do I suppose). I prefer DMing though, and because of my interests and experience with academic history, I have a lot of effort put into worldbuilding. I have pages upon pages written about fake religions, fake history, fake cosmology, fake politics, fake geology and fake economies. My players also engage with that, so that helps a lot. I just like creating something that feels like a living, breathing world; not something that feels like window dressing for a mediocre play. In turn, during all that research, it also lets me understand our world better and refine my own worldview.

I‚Äôm also a big movie and music nerd, and love going to concerts or to the cinema. Analyzing great movies or shitting on awful movies with other people are both equally fun to me. I especially like things with darker themes that manage to make me feel something, and have something unique to offer.


*5.	Tell us how you‚Äôd design any room, house or an office. Do you do it yourself, or trust someone else to do it? Why?*

I‚Äôd like to do it myself. My tastes are eclectic, and giving it a personal touch just adds that much more to a place. Things designed by others can feel sterile in comparison. My tastes are relatively simplistic though, and I would prefer to show this eclectic taste through bold choices of furniture or color, with the odd trinket here and there. I especially like old stuff and bare materials. I‚Äôm one of those weirdos who thinks brutalism can look pretty sick. As long as it‚Äôs not boring.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Section 5**

*1.	Is it acceptable to express emotions in public? Give examples of inappropriate expression of emotions.*

Of course! I am not extremely expressive, but I only have respect for those who shine like a beacon of authenticity. Cry in public, shout, sing, whistle, make out with someone. Anything else is life-denial. Others will just have to deal with it.


*2.	How do you express your emotions? Can you tell how your expressions affect others in a positive or negative way?*

I mostly just laugh a lot, and about everything. I can easily express joy, love or anger, but there is always a bit of a self-awareness about it. An internal ironic detachment I can never fully remove. Sadness is something I keep more to myself, however. I‚Äôve tried opening up sometimes, but I hate it when people project their own ways of processing emotions onto me. Their advice mostly sucks, and I don‚Äôt want someone to just sit, nod and ‚Äúlisten‚Äù. It works for me though. If I‚Äôm sad I just wallow in melancholy for a few hours until I can function again. I don‚Äôt try to hide from it.

I would say I‚Äôm very aware of how my actions and expressions affect others emotionally, after the fact. I just try stuff, and most of the time it sort of works, but I would be lying if I said it was a conscious decision.

*3.	Are you able to change your demeanour in order to interact with your environment in a more or less suitable way? How do you determine what is suitable?*

I‚Äôm always myself, but I can accentuate different aspects in different situations pretty well. Job interviews, interacting with new social groups, dating apps. All of these I‚Äôm pretty decent at. I mostly do it by gut instinct though, and I don‚Äôt think about what I‚Äôm going to say a lot when face-to-face. And sometimes that blows up in my face, but I‚Äôd like to think that most people think it‚Äôs charming.


*4.	In what situations do you feel others‚Äô feelings? Can you give examples of when you wanted to improve the mood of others?*

I don‚Äôt directly feel others' feelings, but I notice them and that affects my feelings. I try to give moral support to friends and family when they‚Äôre feeling down, but sometimes I feel like a lot of moral support is just repeating clich√©s. I try to avoid those, and let them see I really understand what their problem is, to let them feel seen. That isn‚Äôt always as easy as I‚Äôd like though, and mostly just involves letting the other person talk a lot at first. Compassion and hard hitting truths come after.


*5.	How do others‚Äô emotions affect you? How does your internal emotional state correlate or contrast with what you express?*

I can get energized by a good crowd, and I always react to the emotions of others, just not always by feeling what they‚Äôre feeling. Approaching a sad or angry person like you would a happy person seems psychotic. Emotional awareness is a valuable skill. I generally express what I‚Äôm feeling, and find it difficult to deviate too far from it, though I sometimes play it up or down a bit depending on the audience. There‚Äôs a general tendency to play up anger and joy, but play down sadness and love (except to the person I‚Äôm in love with).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Section 6**
*1.	How can you tell how much emotional space there is between yourself and others? How can you affect this space?*

Like who is your friend and such? That‚Äôs just a gut feeling. I have people in my friend group that I don‚Äôt consider actual friends, just because we don‚Äôt vibe that way. So it isn‚Äôt anything to do with how often we see each other or what we call each other. I‚Äôve also told casual acquaintances about pretty personal family issues, so it also isn‚Äôt really about opening up. I think it‚Äôs more about allowing yourself to care about someone, trying to see them warts and all. People feel that. It‚Äôs a sort of extra energy you add to the relationship, and they can then respond in kind. Eventually you reach a limit though, and that depends on how well you match as people.


*2.	How do you determine how much you like or dislike someone else? How does this affect your relationships?*

Chemistry. I know from experience that there is much more to liking someone than shared interests or worldviews. I‚Äôve met political allies who I couldn‚Äôt stand and had awful dates with people who shared all my interests. If we‚Äôre not at least a bit at the same wavelength they‚Äôll never become more than casual friends. I keep them at a distance. I get along with them just fine, but there is just some undefinable quality to the people that I actually grow close to. I even have this with some members of my family, where I just can‚Äôt love them as you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù. I still rarely dislike people though. If I don‚Äôt like them, I‚Äôm not gonna waste my energy on disliking them. I get along with most people, and I feel neutral about most people, and that‚Äôs fine by me.


*3.	How do you move from a distant relationship to a close one? What are the distinguishing characteristics of a close relationship?*

Try. Just put in the effort to make them feel that you care about them, and that you respect them as individuals. If you see them and they see you, you can get closer and closer and closer until at some point you understand them better than they understand themselves. That‚Äôs the ideal, someone who cares that much about you to pierce through you like a dagger and uncover stuff you never even considered. To me, that‚Äôs duality. Someone who sees you as you are at the deepest level and is still 100% on your team. 


*4.	How do you know that you are a moral person? Where do you draw your morality from? Do you believe others should share your beliefs on what‚Äôs moral? Why?*

Oh this question. Honestly, don‚Äôt make it too difficult. If you really wanted to be as moral as possible, you‚Äôd just work 16 hours a day to pay for malaria medication or something. Any time you get a cup of coffee, you could grant someone a week to live. That is an awful way to live though, and I will not do it. Just try to find your own way to be compassionate, brave, and fight for what you believe in. Personal perfection is not necessary to do real good. I don‚Äôt know what I base my morality on. Sometimes it‚Äôs empathy, sometimes it‚Äôs a strategic utilitarianism, but it doesn‚Äôt have a single source. I don‚Äôt really care if people share my beliefs on what‚Äôs moral. They can believe what they want. I just don‚Äôt want their actions to go against what I believe is right. What they carry in their soul is not something I can or care to change.


*5.	Someone you care about is acting distant to you. How do you know when this attitude is a reflection of your relationship?* 

With most people, wouldn‚Äôt even notice. I have enough friends that I don‚Äôt see for months, and then it‚Äôs just as good when I see them again. I generally don‚Äôt miss people or places, and just enjoy what‚Äôs in front of me at that moment. If they need a break from me, that‚Äôs fine. It will only be a reflection on our relationship if neither of us makes the effort to grow closer again. If I would make the effort and they were totally done with me, then that sucks, and I probably wouldn‚Äôt immediately accept it. But there is only so much you can do, and if they don‚Äôt want to, they don‚Äôt want to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Section 7**

*1.	How can you tell someone has the potential to be a successful person? What qualities make a successful person and why?*

Success as defined by certificates, trophies, material things and all that is absolutely worthless to me. I never even picked up my physical bachelor‚Äôs degree just because I had better things to do the day of the graduation ceremony. Success to me is only two things. Overcoming yourself, and overcoming the world. Every person has their own struggles, and for some just merely surviving is a success in its own right. For others, accomplishments that seem immense to my or your are trivial for them. Just keep seeking your limits and you will reach greater and greater heights. 

The second part is changing the world, as I don‚Äôt think figuring out if you can unicycle backwards while playing the violin is really worth all the effort. It needs to have purpose. That means leaving your mark on the world, changing it in a way that only you could have done. If you‚Äôve reached the heights of the corporate ladder and you‚Äôre just a vessel for the interests of the organization, but you‚Äôre not able to steer it in a way that shows something unique to you, I wouldn‚Äôt call that success. You could have been replaced by a hundred other people and no one would have noticed. Is that really worth the effort? Why even try to reach the top if you‚Äôre not going to do anything with it? Money and titles I guess, but that‚Äôs just soulless to me. I like ambition, I like the struggle, but it needs to have purpose. Something that affects the lives of others, hopefully for the better.

*2.	Where would you start when looking for a new hobby? How do you find new opportunities and how do you choose which would be best?*

I just try everything once. If someone invites me to do something I haven‚Äôt done before, I‚Äôm always down to try it. If I like it, I‚Äôll keep doing it. I don‚Äôt actively go looking for them, I just try to live my life in a way in which they will come to me. Hobbies and opportunities are not too different in this regard. I just keep my eyes open, try to live my life in a way in which opportunities might just appear in front of me, and try them once they‚Äôre there.


*3.	How do you interpret the following statement: ‚ÄúIdeas don‚Äôt need to be feasible in order to be worthwhile.‚Äù Do you agree or disagree, and why?*

Soft disagree. I like feeling like my ideas are grounded in some sort of reality. Even in fantasy stories I like worlds that are grounded in people or worlds that feel real. Not just wild stories that sound cool but feel weightless. In humor, absurd premises are still fun, but that requires an awareness that what you‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt feasible. If you‚Äôre fully pie-in-the-sky with your ideas, with no hope of real-world success, then the best you can hope for is that someone more practical-minded takes the best parts of your idea and does something good with it. The two things it‚Äôs good for are comedy and inspiration, but both require grounding.


*4.	Describe your thought process when relating the following ideas: swimming, chicken, sciences. Do you think that others would draw the same or different connections?*

Swimming: Exercise. Water. Breath. The first thing that comes to mind is an olympic swimmer trying to catch his breath between each stroke.

Chicken: Clucking. Pecking. Feed. I just see a chicken, white feathers, clucking and eating feed off the ground in some sort of barn or something. I hear the sound it makes and I smell the stink of the farm.

Sciences: More conceptual than the other two. I immediately go to the scientific method in the abstract, and how I think it kinda rocks. It‚Äôs not perfect by far, but it is a damn good tool for understanding the physical world. As someone with a background in both the natural sciences and the humanities, I know there is much more to life than that though.


*5.	How would you summarize the qualities that are essential to who you are? What kind of potential in you has yet to be actualized and why?*

God I kinda hate this question. I don‚Äôt want to define things as essential, because then I might limit myself. I am both smart and dumb (‚Äúthe dumbest smart person I‚Äôve ever met‚Äù, according to a good friend of mine), emotional and composed, relaxed and willful, optimistic and cynical. Being able to define myself how I want is part of how I actualize. What I am is what I do, and if I learn to do new things, what I am changes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Section 8**
*1.	How do people change? Can you describe how various events change people? Can others see those changes?*

People change when their previous way of doing things reaches a breaking point. If your self-conception doesn‚Äôt match with your innermost desires, then at some point you cannot maintain this image of yourself anymore. The mask breaks and you have to reinvent yourself. Sometimes people see it, but oftentimes it‚Äôs also more difficult to fully get rid of a mask with the people who only knew you with it. Then you change more in how you interact with new people, while the people who knew you longer just see less of you.

*2.	How do you feel and experience time? Can time be wasted? How?*

I have a terrible memory for the events in my own life. All my friends remember people and things much better than I, and I don‚Äôt think about my past that much except for the big events. Even then it‚Äôs rarely with nostalgia or grief, more an acknowledgement that it happened, was good/bad while it lasted, and brought me to where I am today. I also don‚Äôt easily get excited or stressed about the future. If I plan a holiday, I don‚Äôt really think about it between the planning stage and it actually happening. I live in the moment mostly, but I can plan things pretty well when I have to. 

Time can be wasted for sure. Day to day it doesn‚Äôt matter, and I don‚Äôt think you need to be productive or busy every single hour of the day, but it‚Äôs a different thing over the longer term. You only have one life, and I want it to be memorable. I am ambitious, and want to see how far I can take my life. Every year that I‚Äôm not making progress I start worrying about stagnation.

I desperately try to avoid falling in a rut. I at least want something interesting to happen every week. A new date, a party, a city trip, something. I hated the pandemic for making multiple years of my one life on earth feel like a few months. Day to day it wasn‚Äôt even that bad, but I barely remember anything that happened, and that honestly still makes me feel like shit.

*3.	Is there anything that cannot be described with words? What is it? If so, how can we understand what it is if language does not work?* 

Most things. Language is an approximation of the abstract idea behind it, and confusing the one for the other is where my rants in previous sections came from. Don‚Äôt let yourself be tricked by words. Keep the world in front of you in mind and learn to read between the lines, then you‚Äôll be fine. Think charitably, ‚Äúwhat do they mean‚Äù not ‚Äúwhat do they say‚Äù. Thinking doesn‚Äôt only need to be verbal, it is also about perception, and a lot of people don‚Äôt fully develop that ability.

*4.	How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe such unfoldment in your environment?*

I‚Äôm not that good at long-term prediction. I‚Äôm better at analyzing the world as it is now, and what works now, but my long-term strategies are pretty barebones. My career plans can be summed up as

 1. Get a position at [organization]
 2. Make yourself known / Prove your ability 
 3. ??? 
 4. Be the boss. 

I know very well what I want to do once I get there, and have tactics in mind that will help me in step 2 and 3, but I keep it flexible on a day to day basis, keeping my eyes open to jump on any opportunity that is up for grabs.

*5.	In what situations is timing important? How do you know the time is right to act? How do you feel about waiting for the right moment?* 

I‚Äôve ‚Äúwaited for the right moment‚Äù plenty of times in my life, but that was mostly cope. I eventually just did something because inaction brought me nowhere. It never seemed to make anything better, but maybe that‚Äôs just because I suck at picking the right moment. Still, I know that timing does matter. Asking for a promotion while someone‚Äôs in a bad mood is obviously a stupid decision, but rarely is it that obvious and mostly it just feels like chance. In general, I hold that acting is almost always better than not acting if you really want something. Inaction is for when I don‚Äôt really care and it‚Äôs more of an outside obligation. That‚Äôs where my procrastination comes from, but at some point I know that I can‚Äôt get it done if I don‚Äôt start now and then I get up and finally do something. Does that count as waiting for the moment?

1mk6dsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanwellneslife/comments/1mk6dsa/i_replaced_all_refined_sugar_with_piloncillo/,I Replaced All Refined Sugar with Piloncillo,"# I Replaced All Refined Sugar with Piloncillo (Mexican Jaggery) for 30 Days - Here's What Happened

**TL;DR: Swapped white sugar for piloncillo for a month. Energy improved, cravings decreased, and I discovered an amazing traditional sweetener that's actually nutritious.**

Hey Reddit! Just finished something I'm calling the ""30-Day Piloncillo Transformation Challenge"" and wanted to share my experience since I know there are others here interested in natural alternatives and traditional foods.

# What is Piloncillo?

For those who don't know, piloncillo is basically Mexican jaggery - an unrefined cane sugar that keeps all the minerals and nutrients that get stripped away when making white sugar. It tastes like a mix of caramel and molasses, and unlike regular sugar, it actually contains iron, calcium, potassium, and antioxidants.

# Why I Started This Challenge

I was tired of the energy crashes from regular sugar and curious about traditional alternatives. Piloncillo has been used in Mexican cooking for centuries, and I figured there had to be a reason beyond just taste.

# The Rules

Simple: Replace ALL refined sugar with piloncillo for 30 days. That meant:

* Coffee/tea sweetening ‚úì
* Baking and cooking ‚úì
* Any recipes calling for sugar ‚úì
* Zero white/brown sugar, corn syrup, etc. ‚úì

# Week-by-Week Breakdown

**Week 1 - The Adjustment**

* First few days: Everything tasted different (not bad, just... richer?)
* Energy levels were all over the place initially
* Had to learn new baking ratios (spoiler: it's mostly 1:1)

**Week 2 - Getting Stable**

* Energy crashes practically disappeared
* Started noticing I wasn't craving sweets as much
* Coffee tasted amazing with piloncillo's caramel notes

**Week 3 - The Sweet Spot**

* Energy felt more sustained throughout the day
* Sleep quality improved (tracked with my fitness watch)
* White sugar started tasting weirdly artificial when I accidentally had some

**Week 4 - Transformation Mode**

* Felt genuinely better overall
* Discovered piloncillo makes incredible cookies and cakes
* Started planning to continue beyond the 30 days

# Unexpected Benefits

* **Better digestion**: Less bloating after sweet treats
* **Improved skin**: Clearer complexion (could be coincidence?)
* **Enhanced taste**: Regular sugar now tastes one-dimensional
* **Cooking creativity**: Piloncillo adds depth to so many recipes

# The Downsides

* **Availability**: Had to order online since local stores don't carry powdered piloncillo
* **Cost**: More expensive than regular sugar initially
* **Social situations**: Had to explain what I was doing a lot
* **Baking learning curve**: Some textures came out different at first

# Scientific Backing

Did some research and found that unrefined sugars like piloncillo have:

* Lower glycemic index than white sugar
* Actual nutritional content (not empty calories)
* Antioxidant properties
* Less inflammatory response in the body

# Final Thoughts

This wasn't just about sugar - it was about reconnecting with traditional foods that actually nourish instead of just providing sweetness. I feel more energetic, my cravings are way more manageable, and I've fallen in love with the complex flavor.

**Am I continuing?** Absolutely. Piloncillo is now my primary sweetener, though I'm not as strict about avoiding all refined sugar in social situations.

# For Anyone Interested in Trying This

**Start small**: Try it in your coffee/tea first **Source quality**: Get organic piloncillo if possible **Be patient**: Taste buds need time to adjust **Track changes**: Energy, sleep, cravings, etc. **Have realistic expectations**: It's not magic, but the benefits are real

**Questions I'm expecting:**

* ""Is this just placebo effect?"" - Maybe partially, but the energy improvements were pretty obvious
* ""What about diabetics?"" - Definitely consult a doctor first; it's still sugar
* ""Where do you buy it?"" - Mexican grocery stores or online (I use \[brand name\])

Anyone else tried traditional sweeteners like this? Would love to hear about your experiences!

*Edit: Wow, thanks for all the interest! A few people asked for recipes - I'll do a follow-up post with my favorite piloncillo baking discoveries if there's enough demand.*

*Edit 2: For those asking about the science - I'm not a nutritionist, just sharing my personal experience. Always do your own research and consult professionals for medical advice!*",1,1754587792.0,americanwellneslife,0,1.0,False

1mk6ccj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mk6ccj/showcase_best_singleserve_espresso_machine/,Showcase best single-serve espresso machine Nespresso Vertuo Next,"**An Honest Look at the Nespresso ENV120BM Coffee and Espresso Maker**

The Nespresso ENV120BM stirred my curiosity as a coffee enthusiast looking for compact, reliable technology that could churn out caf√©-like beverages at home. I've been using this remarkable coffee and espresso maker for months, and it has undeniably elevated my mornings. However, no product is without quirks, and this one‚Äôs strengths and limitations are worth sharing.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing anyone will notice about this device is its ultra-sleek and compact design. At just 5 inches wide, it sits snugly on my somewhat cluttered countertop, not adding unnecessary bulk. Its matte black finish exudes a clean, modern aesthetic, working in sync with my other kitchen appliances. Designed sustainably, it‚Äôs composed of 54 percent recycled materials, which gave me a feel-good moment about reducing my ecological footprint while sipping a hot brew. The build feels solid yet not overly hefty to move around if needed.

**Brewing Performance**

I‚Äôve tried plenty of coffee makers before, but this one uses Nespresso‚Äôs standout Centrifusion technology. The machine scans the capsule‚Äôs barcode, adjusting brewing parameters for that specific coffee blend. This isn‚Äôt just a gimmick‚Äîit drastically affects the consistency of flavor. Whether making a 5-ounce pour or indulging in an 18-ounce brew, the bold, smooth taste never disappoints. Plus, it supports not only coffee but also espresso with single or double-shot options. Picky about size and flavor? This ensures every cup is tailored to perfection.

**Positives**

‚Ä¢ Delivers consistently rich coffee with velvety crema courtesy of those proprietary Vertuo capsules  
‚Ä¢ Compact and smartly designed to fit any kitchen space without being intrusive  
‚Ä¢ One-touch brewing takes all guesswork out of the process  
‚Ä¢ Energy-saving automatic shut-off feature adds convenience and eco-friendliness  

[Check Nespresso ENV120BM price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b08gl2nj2y/)

**User Experience and Features**

Functionality couldn‚Äôt be simpler. I practically toss in a Vertuo capsule, close the lever, and one button does the rest. My mom isn‚Äôt tech-savvy, but even she has no trouble operating the machine. It's also fully automatic, allowing me to multitask while it preps my coffee. The included starter set introduced me to a variety of capsule options, each distinct and flavorful. Despite being notably silent during operation, this coffee maker feels fast-paced, brewing a cup in minimal time‚Äîgreat for those mornings when you're running late. One downside here is its reliance solely on the proprietary Vertuo capsules, narrowing your choices for experimentation.

**Drawbacks**

‚Ä¢ Exclusively compatible with Vertuo capsules; no room for third-party alternatives  
‚Ä¢ Capsule recycling program, while commendable, requires effort and planning  
‚Ä¢ Water tank is placed awkwardly, making frequent refills slightly annoying  
‚Ä¢ Occasionally, the barcode on capsules doesn't scan properly, which disrupts the brewing process  

**Competing Products**

I‚Äôve owned a Keurig in the past, which many coffee drinkers swear by for its compatibility with different pods, including third-party ones. While Keurig machines like the K-Elite offer convenience, they don‚Äôt quite match Nespresso‚Äôs crema quality nor the aesthetic appeal. Comparatively, manual espresso machines provide fantastic control over the brewing process but demand skill, time, and patience‚Äîthree things I don‚Äôt always have during a busy workday. On the other hand, competitors like the Breville Bambino emphasize pure espresso-making but lack the coffee versatility that makes the Nespresso ENV120BM shine.

**Cost-Efficiency**

Buying into the Nespresso ecosystem isn‚Äôt the cheapest route‚Äîthose Vertuo capsules can add up quickly. But if you value high-quality, caf√©-style beverages within seconds, the investment starts to seem reasonable. As a daily coffee drinker used to spending on takeout lattes, this machine has gradually made me realize I‚Äôm saving money in the long run.

1mk6b98,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1mk6b98/showcase_the_best_countertop_microwave_oven_by/,Showcase the Best Countertop Microwave Oven by Farberware and Why,"Farberware FM11BKBSS caught my attention because of its stainless-steel design and the promise of blending functionality with style. Picture this: I‚Äôm in my kitchen juggling a million things‚Äîburnt toast here, a smoothie disaster there‚Äîand this microwave really showed up for me over the last few weeks. But, like any gadget in my chaotic life, it does have its quirks.

**Perfect Size for Tight Spaces**

One of the first things I noticed was how compact and functional this microwave is. Its 1.1 cubic feet capacity feels just right‚Äînot too bulky to hog counter space, yet spacious enough to handle dinner plates and larger bowls. I managed to fit it comfortably on my cluttered counter, squeezed between a coffee maker and a random stack of cookbooks I never open. It‚Äôs definitely suitable for small kitchens or office break rooms without compromising on function. The stainless-steel finish adds a touch of class, too, making it more of a statement piece rather than just another appliance.

**Cooking Versatility at Its Best**

I wasn‚Äôt expecting much in terms of versatility, but this microwave surprised me with its range of options. The 10 power levels make it easy to adjust the heat, and the multi-stage cooking feature became something I didn‚Äôt know I needed. For instance, I defrosted chicken by weight one evening (flawlessly, I might add), and then set it to cook with a separate timer. And let‚Äôs not forget the one-touch cooking presets for popcorn, potato, and pizza‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt need the holy trinity of late-night snacks? I found the defrost options convenient, too, especially when I forgot to thaw veggies for dinner. It was a real time saver.

**Check [Farberware FM11BKBSS] price on Amazon.**

**User-Friendly Design**

The controls are surprisingly intuitive. I‚Äôm not a fan of complicated gadgets, and this one is a breeze to navigate. The express cooking buttons (1-6 minutes) and the 30-second add-on feature made heating leftovers simple, even for my tech-challenged roommate. Plus, the memory function? Brilliant. I saved my personalized settings for reheating coffee‚Äîbecause microwaved coffee will forever be part of adulthood. 

While the LED display is bright and easy to read, I did find myself obsessively staring at the countdown like I was watching an action movie. The interior lighting lets you keep an eye on your food without needing to open the door a hundred times. No small detail is overlooked here. Even the large, easy-grip door handle feels perfectly ergonomic.

**Winning Points**

- Sleek stainless-steel exterior adds a modern aesthetic to any kitchen counter.
- 1.1 cubic feet capacity strikes a balance between compact size and usability.
- 1000 watts of power cooks meals efficiently and evenly.
- 6 preset programs simplify cooking for common foods like pizza and popcorn.
- Child safety lock gives an added sense of security for families with little ones.

**Caveats**

No product is without its minor flaws, and this microwave has a few points worth considering:

- It‚Äôs slightly heavier than I expected for its size, coming in at over 34 pounds. Not ideal if you plan on moving it around frequently.
- I noticed the exterior gets a bit warm during extended use, which could be an issue if you have curious kids around.
- The door feels slightly stiff to open at first but loosens up with regular use‚Äîit‚Äôs not a deal-breaker, but it caught me off guard initially.

**Peer Products**

Compared to other microwaves in its category, the Farberware FM11BKBSS holds its own quite well. For instance, Panasonic‚Äôs models often boast similar wattage with more advanced inverter technology, but they come at a premium price. On the other hand, budget-friendly options like Black+Decker might lack the same stylish finish or some of the functionality Farberware offers, such as multi-stage cooking or the memory function. Where this microwave really shines is in its balance of performance, durability, and price‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre sacrificing anything significant to stay within budget. The stainless-steel exterior is certainly a visual upgrade compared to basic models from competing brands.

**Money's Worth**

If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable yet feature-rich microwave, this one is tough to beat. It strikes a nice middle ground between extravagance and bare-bones functionality. While it isn‚Äôt the most advanced microwave on the market, it delivers reliable performance and ease of use, making it worth the investment. The intuitive controls, stylish finish, and solid cooking capabilities make it ideal for families and singles alike. It‚Äôs like getting a moderately priced smartphone with premium features‚Äîuseful, practical, and sleek without draining your wallet.

His birthday trip to Nashville was all about Kylea, and his cake/celebration at home was pathetic...

By comparison, Kylea started buying herself birthday gifts months before the big day (professional hair care products and her cowboy-themed Swig tumbler).  She also bought herself a new shower head system, Gilmore Girls blanket, 4 night gowns, a shopping cart full of fall home decor, and TREATed herself to all the iced coffees during her birthday week.  ""Joe"" bought her Halloweeen/Fall nightgowns and a Bronco T-shirt.  Sweet Mama gifted her a Jonas Bros ticket for 08/30 and just today, Kylea announced she will no longer attend her birthday ""bucketlist"" Cody Johnson concert on 08/23 that she started talking about in March...#broke  #engagement bait

It's *interesting* that she received NoThINg homemade or store bought from her bio dad, siblings (hers or Joe's), or friends. ü§î  She works soooo hard, making every holiday special and always blessing them with her things or gifts...üêù

If anyone did attend her birthday party, they feasted on takeout Mexican (no toppings allowed) and an over-the-top pink bakery cake (no WW points shared).

So I am due for my first baby (girl) in December 2025. I am debating about whether or not to have a baby shower. My mom and mother in law want to throw me one.

My friend had her baby shower there last year and it turned out great! However my mom and mother in law are trying to change the venue and keep throwing out different ideas that‚Äôs gonna cost a lot of money. They also want to invite everyone they know like it‚Äôs a huge wedding. The space will only hold a set amount of people and I only want immediate family and my friends there (not cousins I haven‚Äôt seen in years and don‚Äôt even have a relationship with other than occasionally seeing them on the holidays). Nothing against any family members I don‚Äôt really see or talk to I would just rather have people I actually have consistent relationships with there especially since the space only holds a set amount of people. My mom and mother in law keep pushing me to change the venue and add a bunch of expensive things to my registry. I am the type of person who really hates asking people for things especially that‚Äôs super expensive. My husband and I have already bought most of the expensive things on our own like a crib, stroller and car seat.

1mk5zxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mk5zxt/explore_the_best_singleserve_brewer_nespresso/,Explore the Best Single-Serve Brewer Nespresso Vertuo Pop Plus,"The Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee and Espresso Machine by De'Longhi has been my go-to coffee companion for a while now, and I feel ready to share my thoughts on it. It combines practicality, sleek design, and versatility in a way that fits nicely into my daily coffee routine. As someone who drinks both coffee and espresso regularly, this machine caught my attention from the start, and it‚Äôs been an interesting ride testing its features.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, what struck me first was its compact size. The sleek design with a liquorice black finish added a modern touch to my countertop without taking up much space. With its removable 25 fl. oz. water tank placed conveniently on the side, refilling has been hassle-free. The adjustable drip tray, which accommodates different cup sizes, is another thoughtful feature. It‚Äôs easy to see how this design works well in small kitchen spaces or even a cozy office setup.

**Ease of Use**  
The one-touch system really lives up to its name. It takes just one press to brew a cup of coffee or espresso to perfection. On busy mornings, the 30-second heat-up time has been a lifesaver, letting me skip the wait and jump straight to enjoying my drink. And while I didn‚Äôt expect much from a coffee machine in terms of maintenance, the descaling alert ensures I don‚Äôt forget to take care of it, which prolongs its lifespan.  

Check [Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee and Espresso Machine by De'Longhi] price on Amazon.

**Coffee Variety and Brew Quality**  
As a coffee enthusiast, the variety of drinks this machine offers has been its biggest selling point for me. You get a choice of 5 sizes ranging from 5oz to 12oz coffees, plus single or double espressos. It‚Äôs even designed for versatility, giving you the option to brew your coffee hot or over ice. Every cup is topped with that velvety coffee foam Nespresso is known for, and it genuinely feels like a caf√© experience in my kitchen. The precision brewing technology ensures the flavor is consistently smooth and bold ‚Äî no bitter aftertaste, ever.  

**Sustainability Features**  
Another aspect I respect about this coffee maker is its commitment to sustainability. Nespresso uses fully recyclable aluminum capsules, and they‚Äôve made the recycling process straightforward with their free program. I‚Äôve been consciously collecting the used capsules and returning them as part of this initiative. For those concerned about waste and environmental impact, this is a feature you‚Äôll appreciate.

**Perks**  
- Compact size makes it ideal for smaller spaces.  
- Offers a variety of drink sizes, including iced options.  
- One-touch brewing makes operation incredibly simple.  
- Produces a smooth, consistent coffee flavor with a caf√©-like foam on top.  
- Comes with a complimentary tasting pack for first-time users.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The capsule-specific brewing system limits you to only Nespresso Vertuo capsules, which means you can‚Äôt use other brands or generic capsules.  
- It doesn‚Äôt include a milk frother, so latte and cappuccino lovers will need an additional purchase for that.  
- The water tank, while easy to refill, is small enough that frequent users will find themselves topping it up daily.  

**Product Alternates**  
The closest competitor I‚Äôve personally used is the Keurig K-Elite. It‚Äôs another single-serve coffee machine, known for its large water reservoir and compatibility with a wide range of K-Cup pods ‚Äî something I wish the Nespresso machine offered. However, the coffee quality isn‚Äôt as rich and full-bodied as the Vertuo Pop+, and the Keurig lacks that signature coffee foam. Another option could be the Breville Barista Express for those wanting to experiment as amateur baristas. It‚Äôs great for grinding fresh beans and offers more control, but its price point and added setup steps might not suit everyone, especially if you just want a quick coffee fix.

**Affordable Quality**  
Given its brewing precision, drink variety, and ease of use, this machine offers decent value for its price range. While it‚Äôs slightly more niche due to the exclusive capsule compatibility, the flavors and overall quality make it worthwhile for those who enjoy premium coffee. Compared to competitors like Keurig, which tend to focus on convenience but compromise on quality, this machine positions itself as an excellent option for those seeking simplicity without sacrificing taste.

I run about 4x a week, with one run being a long run. I am not typically hungry in the mornings and am very used to training fasted (I am pretty new to running and have only been at it for a few months, but have been lifting for years).

  
My longest run so far has been 9 miles. This weekend I'm going to go for 10. I run early morning, so before eating anything typically. Just water with electrolytes and a coffee. I want to keep running fasted because I also assume on the day of the race I won't want to eat anything beforehand either. But 10+ miles, especially in the heat and humidity, does seem like kind of a lot to do on empty.

  
Is this okay? I usually eat right after, and it's usually a healthy and balanced meal.

Also, I don't know how relevant this is, but I have reactive hypoglycemia. I had vlpodwork done a couple months ago and my glucose went down from 80 to 65 two hours after eating. So that actually makes me feel like it's probably better not to eat, because I wouldn't want my levels going down like that. I'm not a doctor or anything though so I guess I don't know.

I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, part of me believes I could have adhd but at the same time I don't believe it. So let me explain. 

I'm tired, exhausted all the time and yet my thoughts never stop. Everyday tasks feel like work, getting out of bed to make coffee feels like the hardest thing in the world. I find myself forcing myself to eat to shower. It shouldn't be this hard just being alive. It's been like this for so long, I don't remember a time where I didn't feel tired regardless of how much sleep I get. 

My family tells me I'm depressed because I don't get out enough but the more I tell them how difficult it is for me to find the motivation to get out of bed or do anything, the more they tell me to just do it. I can't explain what it's like and they keep asking me why I'm so depressed but I don't know. I don't have an answer as to why I am the way I am. 

On the weekend I spend hours just doom scrolling and then I feel guilty because I've wasted the weekend, I feel useless most of the time. The part of me that doesn't believe I have adhd believes that maybe I'm making it worse than what it is. Like I'm trying to justify my laziness. 

When I was diagnosed with BPD my family didn't believe it, they said I'm just going through a low phase and it'll pass and the part of me that doubts the adhd clings to that, that there's nothing wrong with me and I'm making it up. 

The other part of me knows it's not normal to have loud thoughts, to not be able to watch a movie without having something else to do. It's not normal to zone out mid conversation, or forget things that's important. My mind feels like it's constantly screaming and I can't explain it to anyone.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. On Sunday, after a really long time of agonizing over the decision, I finally got the guts to tell my husband that I want a separation. He was absolutely reeling, which I can understand (he likes to deny that we haven‚Äôt been happy for years, and likely never expected me to want to split), and I had to leave the house for a while because it was tearing me up. When I got home (after sobbing in my car for hours) I went right to bed.

Next morning he wakes me up asking if I was getting up soon. He wanted to go for a coffee and talk. Laid over me, giving me a hug, holding back tears, saying he knows he hasn‚Äôt treated me well and apologized for it. Then left for me to get ready. We went out and talked in the car, and he drove around a bit. We didn‚Äôt really continue the separation talk, but he was telling me all of the things that we could do to solve our money problems (he‚Äôs never been willing to talk to someone, and I‚Äôm WAY more in debt than him because if it), something he‚Äôs been refusing to talk about for months‚Ä¶even years.

Neither of us had said anything to our teen and young adult kids, so he insisted on a drive and ice cream trip later that night.

I am so disconnected from my emotions right now that I don‚Äôt know which end is up. I had already been to a lawyer and I know that ai will be absolutely hosed in the separation, but I had finally reached the point where I knew ai had to do it. But right now, I know my nervous system is calm because ‚Äúnormal‚Äù has been restored. I also know that nothing has been solved, and if I don‚Äôt press forward, I‚Äôm going to end up even worse off later. I‚Äôve always felt like I could just put up with things for the rest of my life so that I don‚Äôt blow up everyone else‚Äôs. So getting the courage to get past my overwhelm to say I wanted to separate was huge, and sickening, for me.

I'll be honest, I haven't read the manual too much aside from the handful of times I read it initially when I first got the machine, and I actually gave up because I couldn't get the machine to make me a cup of espresso (not a hot one at least, like, it was literally cold). Eventually I went back, re-read the instructions, and there was some kind of a start up process you had to do in order for the machine to understand the setup for it to finally make hot espressos. Anyways, I bring that up though because maybe there is some kind of setting or something that can make the difference. But I thought I would ask on here first before having to scour the manual to see if I can find anything, maybe there is some shared ""universal"" process (especially for lower end espresso machines like mine) for the majority of espresso machines on how they work when it comes to getting into the ""espresso range"". I make sure to finely ground my coffee beans, and my machine only has 4 buttons: ""1 cup"", ""2 cup"", ""steam/hot water"" and ""on/off and descale"". As for the latter, maybe the ""descale"" does something? I only use that button to turn on and off, I don't know what ""descaling"" is and I don't know how to activate that particular setting on that button. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Then she asked me if I had ever had surgery and I was like no and she was like ""huh...."". So that concerned me.

1mk5uiz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mk5uiz,Iceland final thoughts after our trip üáÆüá∏üáÆüá∏üáÆüá∏,"Hello everyone! Some of you might‚Äôve seen my posts around the sub asking various questions about Iceland. I am glad to say that this was the most wonderful trip ever! Me and my brother really enjoyed it and the Icelandic people were super kind and helpful! We took the shuttle bus to the volcano this past Saturday the day we landed in Iceland. 52 miles per hour winds, rain, black lava fields everywhere, and less than an hour of sleep, but seeing the Sundhn√∫kur Volcano from the top of a mountain in Iceland was totally worth it! We did the entire golden circle and Br√∫arfoss was magnificent! It‚Äôs shocking how blue the water was. There was a moment at √æ√≥rufoss where me and my brother were completely alone! I stood there for like 3 minutes in complete silence just taking deep breaths and pretending like I was a Viking explorer! Truly a stress reliever! The south coast was definitely the highlight of our trip! S√≥lheimaj√∂kull glacier, the village of V√≠k, and Fja√∞r√°rglj√∫fur Canyon were unreal, remarkable, and otherworldly! My brother was sitting on the bench by the V√≠k church whilst I decided to go up the hill to the viewpoint by the cemetery. Me and another guy with his RV smoking a cigarette were alone there. It was so peaceful and beautiful. As soon as my brother laid his eyes upon the viewpoint at Dyrh√≥laey, the first words he said were: ‚ÄúWhat a world man.‚Äù Sk√≥gafoss, Glj√∫frab√∫i, Seljalandsfoss, and Kvernufoss were amazing. Saw a wedding shoot happening at Kvernufoss as well, and I really wanna see the wedding photos! There was leaking drops of water falling from the top of the cave behind Kvernufoss and we stood under it and it refreshed us so much after a long day of site seeing. Lastly, I will definitely be back in Iceland to complete the entire ring road and to see the highlands, especially Th√≥rsm√∂rk. The only thing we were confused about was the speed limit. At some points, it definitely felt too slow for the road, especially on the golden circle and near Reykjav√≠k. We saw TikToks about how the speeding fines in Iceland were really bad so we definitely stayed below the speed limit. If anyone encountered a dark grey Hyundai i20 on the ring road on the southern coast on Monday, August 4th, going 85 km instead of 90. When safe, people did go on the opposite side of the road and passed us. We just didn‚Äôt want to get any speeding fines and wanted to follow the rules. We apologize if this caused any inconvenience for anyone. I attached pictures from our trip. As a 19 year old from the United States, getting to see these landscapes was amazing. Thank you!

So I found myself lucky enough to get an extremely cheap rate at a good hotel in Anchorage through a work connection, and despite only having about a month in advance to book things ($672 for 3.5 days with a Nissan Versa that I wasn't allowed to take on any unpaved road, though I still took the risk a few times. No damage, no regrets) I still had a wonderful time and would absolutely love to do a week+ long camping trip somewhere up there. I'm preaching to the choir but it's just so beautiful, summer in Alaska is nature at it's peak. And I ""only"" had a half week worth of time to run around.

First thing I did was fall asleep in my hotel room after landing at 1am, but I got up around 6:30am, put some coffee in my Yeti, and took a stroll through Kincaid. Mostly wanting to get myself stretched out before going to hike Flattop later in the day. This will shock probably nobody reading this, but going up a hill on Mize Loop, right after the disc golf course, I spotted my first moose, a bull with huge antlers. Just chowing down on a fallen tree, directly in the walking trail. As someone who had never seen a moose in person, I'm not ashamed to say I took way too many photos of him. I stood around the same area (was about 200 feet back, with a hill going down+up in between. Had no intention of getting closer for obvious reasons, plus he was already in plain enough view) for about 10 minutes just watching him eat those leaves. He knew I was there too, looked over at me about 5 times, it was surreal. Eventually I turned around and went on another trail, and ended up seeing 2 other moose in the brush, and a 4th one next to another walking trail on the drive out of the park. Really mesmerizing, I knew they were huge but to see them in person as someone who only grew up around whitetail deer and black bears was just different in the best way.

That rambling leads me to...

1. *Why in the absolute fuck would anyone walk around a place like Kincaid Park with their dogs not on a leash?!?!?!*

I had multiple unleashed dogs approach+jump on me during that 2-3-ish hours I was in Kincaid, which in a vacuum I'm fine with, they were all nice dogs, but if this is an area where it's not uncommon to have an unpredictable 1000 pound beast just feasting in the middle of a walking trail... is that not a major risk for everyone involved for a dog to be running free? Is that not why it's written on signs to keep all pets on a leash? One would think that APD/rangers/animal control could make a fortune by just having an officer hike around Kincaid all day looking for unleashed dogs, no?

2. What do you do when there's a bull in your yard in the middle of rut? Do you just wait inside and hope it doesn't go crazy and ruin your things? Does insurance ever have issues covering a moose damaging property?

3. Wild topic swing, but what is the hockey scene like in Anchorage/around the state? Once winter comes around, are tournaments a regular thing there? I assume it wouldn't be quite as much of a cultural thing as it is in parts of Canada, but I'd enjoy watching Alaskan Hockey

4. What are some things you would specifically tell anyone who to watch out for before they go deeper into the state, be it down the Seward Highway or Up North? This trip was more of a spontaneous/luck based thing where I was able to get away from LA and explore Chugach (Powerline Pass is probably going to stay my favorite trail I've ever hiked) and parts of the Kenai Peninsula, whereas I'll have plenty of time to plan when I come again. 

5. Is it less crowded for a tourist to come around in the spring (mid-late April) or in the fall (September)? Which time of year tends to be colder?

1mk5sw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LUCID/comments/1mk5sw6/compared_to_the_air_not_as_impressed_with_the/,Compared to the Air -Not as impressed with the Gravity GT as I hoped to be...,"I just picked up my Gravity GT (no third-row seats, smaller wheels, all upgrades except the Tech package) and have a two year lease. I know my complaints are solidly in the ‚Äúfirst-world problems‚Äù category because the Gravity really *is*¬†an incredible vehicle‚Äîand I‚Äôm lucky to drive it for the next two years. Still, I think I would‚Äôve been happier sticking with another Air (currently leasing an Air GT until Sept 1) instead of going with the SUV.

The Gravity has good upgrades, but it just doesn‚Äôt feel nearly as quick or responsive as my Air. One of the most fun parts of EV driving, IMO, is that instant surge when you hit the pedal‚Äîespecially with a full charge. In the Gravity, the 0‚Äì60 feels like it takes a coffee break on the way there.

That said, it‚Äôs got some really thoughtful improvements:  
‚Äì Normal-sized cup holders (!!)  
‚Äì A press-to-open charge port  
‚Äì No adapter needed for standard Tesla home chargers (big plus for those of us who made the switch)  
‚Äì Way more headroom and clearance‚Äîtaller drivers will be happy.

As someone on the petite side, I do wish the driver‚Äôs seat lifted a bit higher. My Air does better in that department.  Also, still no Apple Car Play.  The key fob is quirky and doesn't want connect so it keeps telling you there is no key in the car and to shake the fob - lot of shaking going on.  

Now for the looks‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in a Green Metallic with Stealth trim and Tahoe interior. The interior is beautiful‚Äîsuper luxe‚Äîbut the exterior doesn‚Äôt really turn heads, at least not for me. I get why people say it gives off station wagon or minivan vibes, especially in the lowest suspension height. Standard setting looks better.  

Overall: a fantastic car. But if you‚Äôre on the fence between sedan and SUV, and don‚Äôt¬†*really*¬†need the extra space or a third row, test drive both more than once. The Air deals right now are seriously worth considering.

i just got married and found out my husband lives like this too and it always turn into a fight. every time i tell him to do it properly he just starts to sulk. is it my fault the glass still smells like old milk since u didnt wash it properly, there's still some milk deposits in there. the audacity to say youre tired when i also work full time. u said u took youre time to drink coffee and eat cereal but suddenly no time to wash the bowl and glass cuz were rushing to work. be fucking for real. the way i have to grease u up so u dont sulk is crazyy. in the future maybe we'll have separate laundry baskets, tableware and rooms.

I get pretty anxious w/ the big city/no parking/large parking structures! I‚Äôm looking for a happy medium area in SD. Hoping to stay central (driving distance) enough to activities (coffee shops, breweries, salsa dancing!) but not in the city city if that makes sense! North park and mission valley seem great but too city like for me! Same w beach cities! Tierresanta felt too quiet! Also visited Carlsbad and Oceanside which felt more in my comfort zone but felt a little far out.

Questions-

1) what other areas would you recommend I explore? Anyone know anything about kerney mesa and Serra mesa? They seem central (especially to dancing classes!) but I haven‚Äôt checked them out yet.

2) am I being unrealistic trying to find rentals with private access garages (like townhome style)? For safety purposes this is very important to me but has been very difficult to find! Also really prefer gated. If anyone knows of any complexes that they love, def appreciate any suggestions!

1mk5ndp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mk5ndp,"A few different meals, UK NHS (public) inpatient ward","Just had the dubious pleasure of six days in my local NHS hospital here in London. For the most part the food was edible, bland and uninspiring. Very institutional and entirely lacking in any vegetables or nutritional balance. 

I tend to stick with something once I know it‚Äôs palatable, and a couple of times what I wanted wasn‚Äôt available (never could get allocated the salmon pasta) so I just reverted to the same things as second choices, so the other days were just repeats. 

Menu first, then:

- Breakfast: Weetabix with cold milk and one sugar (I chose the same every day; some other cereals were also available plus bread and jam but not toast).

- Lunches: (1) tuna mayo sandwich with tinned fruit; (2) chicken mayo sandwich; (3) jacket potato with tuna mayo and salad (the only sight of any salad), tinned peaches. 

- Dinner: (1) macaroni cheese which came with the jam sponge and custard in the next photo; (2) pasta bolognese (this was bad) with pineapple upside down cake and custard; (3) ‚Äúessential‚Äù ice cream I had on another night. 

Choice of orange or apple juice at each meal. Insipid tea provided at breakfast and infrequently thereafter. Much reliance on relatives bringing in fruit, treats and coffees, and a lot of swapping and trading of those after hours!

I didn‚Äôt hate it and it kept me alive, generally inoffensive apart from the bolognese so let‚Äôs say 5/10 overall. But my god I was craving a vegetable when I got out. ",62,1754586166.0,hospitalfood,13,1.0,False

1mk5mi0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mk5mi0,"Delta First Class - if you love bugs, this the airline for you","Since a Delta One flight from SLC to LHR a few years ago sitting in coffee stained chairs (at least I hope it was coffee) adorned with the food, dirt and debris from the prior occupants, I‚Äôve accepted that Delta One and Delta First Class was no longer what it once was.  I‚Äôve since accepted that, although they were to be a ‚Äúpremier service‚Äù or ‚Äúluxury service‚Äù offerings, Delta One and Delta First Class wasn‚Äôt going to meet my specifications for cleanliness (or even meet the specifications for cleanliness promulgated by any county health board).  Yet, knowing that cabin cleanliness even in ‚Äúpremier cabins‚Äù is now a crap shoot, I still fly Delta, steeling myself for what my come and, like so many now, bring my own supplies to clean food, dirt and stains off of arm rests and chairs.  Last night‚Äôs flight from STL to SLC taught this old flyer that I must now include in my flight bag one more thing:  a huge can of Raid to address nests of cockroaches in the cabin.
 
My wife and I boarded in STL and approached our seats, 1C and 1D.  (We actually like the front row as we want to avoid the person in front of us reclining into our lap as if we‚Äôre his dentist.)  Unfortunately, as all too common now, we noticed that our seats and surrounding floor were covered in food remnants and other grime and, without making a fuss, took out our wet wipes and cleaned off the ‚Äúwater‚Äù on our seats along with the other stuff that I‚Äôd rather not think about.  Apparently, we‚Äôre de facto Delta cleaning employees sans rubber gloves.  We took our seats, remembering how in olden days first class passengers were provided with a pre-flight beverage, and settled in for the 2 hour and 40 minute flight to Salt Lake.
 
We were served our dinner, which used to entail a main course, like braised beef with vegetables, a side salad, a dinner roll and dessert.  On this flight, we got our main course, but no side salad and, instead of a dinner roll was a plate that had nothing on it but a pad of butter.  Ah well, such is flight these days, we thought. 
 
As we started to eat dinner, our appetites were doused as we watched with disgust a cockroach scurry up the bulkhead wall immediately in front of us and inches from our feet. The vermin then retreated back down the bulkhead to an indentation where the bulkhead met the cabin floor.  Using the light on my phone, I looked at said indentation and was horrified not only to find years upon years of decaying food and filth but a horde of similar cockroaches of varying sizes.  Needless to say, we were revolted.  Soon the passengers on the other side of the aisle began having the same creepy visitors on their bulkhead and around their feet.   I explained the situation to the flight attendant who confirmed my observations, was very apologetic, and who said that he would immediately report the infestation to the captain and Delta headquarters in Atlanta.  (Later, the flight attendant stated that, in response to his report to Atlanta of the infestation, Atlanta‚Äôs only resonse was ‚Äúwhat kind of bugs are they?‚Äù ‚Äì as if it matters!  I told the flight attendant that he should make an announcement asking if there was an entomologist on board.)  We spent the next our and a half with our feet on seats, along with any of our belongings, trying to isolate ourselves as much as we could from the garbage can conditions surrounding us.  Instead of relaxing and watching a movie, we were in our own action thriller of ‚ÄúBugs on a Plane‚Äù.  For an hour and half, we battled the cockroaches, knocking them from bulkhead and swatting them away from us.  Ah, the luxurious conditions of Delta first class.
 
Upon arrival, the flight attendant suggested that we stop in the SkyClub and talk to a customer service agent there to avoid crowds and to possibly have that dinner that we were repulsed from having on the plane.  We attempted to do so, showing the SkyClub door attendant the FA‚Äôs card given to us and recounting our story.  Instead of sympathy or even an apology, the SkyClub attendant was brisk, stern and repeatedly said we‚Äôre not getting in the club unless we have the appropriate credentials. (My wife actually does have such credentials but we didn‚Äôt think it fair to have to pay $50 for my entry when we were effectively denied our meals because cockroaches were climbing all about.)  Ah, the legendary Delta first class customer service. 
 
Delta was once a great airline. Now it‚Äôs a fleet of garbage cans, petri dishes with wings with Oscar the Grouch purporting to provide ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù.
 
Remember, after going through TSA, be sure to stop by a shop and pick up all the things that you need for your next Delta first class or Delta One flight:  cleaning wipes, anti-nausea medication, rubber gloves, a shop vac, and a huge can of industrial strength insecticide.",0,1754586115.0,delta,18,0.35,False

1mk5lsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1mk5lsc/should_you_try_3d_all_purpose_cleaner_for/,Should You Try 3D All Purpose Cleaner for Interior and Exterior Review?,"The **3D 104G01 All Purpose Cleaner ‚Äì High-Performance Interior & Exterior Car Cleaner for Vinyl, Leather, Plastic, Fabric, Carpet & More** has been my go-to companion over the past few weeks, and saying it‚Äôs made my car cleaning days easier is an understatement. I‚Äôll admit, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from an ""all-purpose cleaner,"" but this product had me pleasantly surprised in several ways - though, naturally, there are some details to be mindful of. Let's dive into the pros, quirks, and my personal experience with this cleaning wizard.

**Effortless Cleaning Versatility**  
What genuinely took me by surprise was the versatility of this product. It‚Äôs marketed as being safe for a wide range of surfaces ‚Äì leather, vinyl, plastic, fabric, and even carpets ‚Äì and believe me, it delivers. I used it to zap stubborn coffee spills on my car mat, clean sticky gunk from my cup holders, and even revived the dashboard‚Äôs look after months of neglect. The fact that a single product could handle all these tasks without damaging any material had me wondering why I hadn‚Äôt tried it years ago.  

[Check 3D 104G01 All Purpose Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0007rvl7m/)  

**User-Controlled Strength & Dilution**  
One of the standout features of this cleaner is its flexibility. You can use it straight out of the bottle for heavy-duty cleaning (trust me, it‚Äôs a beast against oil and grease), or dilute it for those lighter, maintenance-level jobs. I experimented with both settings, trying it on everything from my engine bay to trunk liners, dashboards, and door panels. Whether I was gearing up for thorough detailing or just a quick refresh, this All Purpose Cleaner adapted perfectly. Even the most stubborn grease marks didn‚Äôt stand a chance when used at its full strength. 

**Eco-Friendly Yet Potent Formula**  
Another aspect that I appreciated was its formulation. It‚Äôs non-toxic, biodegradable, and developed with Green Technology, which means it's safe to use both for my car and me. No weird fumes or harsh chemical residue after cleanup. Oh, and for those like me who are sensitive to strong smells, this one comes unscented. It‚Äôs like a ninja cleaner ‚Äì silent but deadly to grime!

**Advantages**  
- Works effectively across multiple surfaces like leather, fabric, vinyl, and plastic.  
- Biodegradable and safe for the environment while being tough on stains.  
- Offers the ability to dilute based on cleaning intensity, giving you complete control.  
- Excellent for getting rid of odors ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt just mask them but neutralizes them at their source.  

**Weaknesses**  
While my experience was largely positive, a few things stood out as areas to keep in mind:  
- The packaging could use a better nozzle for heavier applications. I had to transfer it into another spray bottle for convenience.  
- It doesn‚Äôt have the luxury ‚Äúafter-clean‚Äù scent that some might enjoy (it‚Äôs unscented, which could be a pro for some people too).  
- Though it‚Äôs marketed as all-purpose, delicate items like suede or specialty finishes might need a different cleaner entirely.  

**Competing Products**  
When it comes to competition, I‚Äôve tried other well-known options like Meguiar's All Purpose Cleaner and Chemical Guys Total Interior Cleaner. While those are great for their own reasons, they fall short in a couple of ways. Meguiar‚Äôs is potent but often too harsh for delicate surfaces, whereas the latter is more forgiving but struggles with tough stains. This product sits right in the sweet spot ‚Äì potent enough for grease and grime but gentle on interior materials. It‚Äôs all about balance here, and the All Purpose Cleaner nails it.  

**Quality for Price**  
Considering its versatility and effectiveness, this cleaner offers serious value for its price. The ability to dilute stretches how far the product can go, and for someone who finds joy in maintaining their car‚Äôs pristine interior, it‚Äôs an investment. Cheaper cleaners may seem tempting, but they either fail to deliver or require multiple complementary products. This single gallon of magic replaced three different cleaners I used before!

We‚Äôre both 30. I drove 1.5 hours to meet her at a mall near her place because she has anxiety about driving. She only had to drive about 10 minutes. I also paid around $10 in tolls. I did not really mind, but it does add up.

We went to lunch and split the bill evenly at $40 each (it was just easier than asking for separate checks). She ordered two appetizers that I couldn‚Äôt eat because of my dairy allergy, which I didn‚Äôt mind . She ended up taking them home.

After lunch, she wanted to get a massage at one of those open mall spots with an actual massage therapist. It was $25 for 20 minutes. She ended her massage a little early, and by the time I was done, she had already paid for both of us and tipped about $20 total.

We went to Starbucks afterward and I bought her a drink, around $9. Before we said goodbye, I gave her a small birthday gift I had brought with me. It was not anything extravagant, maybe around $60. My birthday is three days before hers and she didn‚Äôt get me anything, which is perfectly fine.

But when I came back from my car to give her the gift, she said, ‚ÄúIf you could pay me back for the massage that would be great.‚Äù

I Venmoed her right away, but the whole interaction left me feeling a little off. She could‚Äôve asked me to pay her back right after the massage (and before the coffee). Then I bought her coffee and gave her a gift. I do not care about the money, it is more the way she handled it.

BIN or Cover Stain for Primer?,"Looking to paint a coffee table and every online video I see (all from lonely house wives lol) has them using BIN as a primer.  In a different thread here the poster stated that BIN should not be used for full surface priming, only spot priming EVEN indoors.

The logic was that wood will expand / contract and it will eventually fail.  I called Zinnser (Rustoleum now) and they said either would be fine but BIN would be just slightly better.

Any thoughts on the possibility of the primer cracking?  I have cans of both so just looking to use the best one.

For example, ‚Üí Don't check your phone before starting work.

‚Üí In the morning, make a basic to-do list and stick to it.

‚Üí Put your phone aside for one focused hour.

* **Broken Coast - London Marker #92** Reviewer: u/Ok-Assignment-7819 \[8/10\] They gave high marks for appearance and taste, liking the smooth smoke and nice head high, though the burn could improve; they recommended it for gassy berry or Permanent Marker fans at $9-10 per gram, potentially less with discounts.

# 9. Tribal üî•üí© 49

**Trending Products: 2 | Reviewers: 2 | Sentiment Summary:**¬†Tribal is getting mixed reviews with one üî• and one üí©, reflecting varied consumer experiences. With two trending products and two reviewers, feedback ranges from high praise to significant disappointment.

* **Tribal - Neon Sunshine** Reviewer: u/Neat_Cable4026 \[10/10\] They loved this product, describing it as a perfect indica-sativa blend, appreciating the aroma, flavour, effects, and amazing price point, and would highly recommend and repurchase.
* **Tribal - Triple Burger Cart** Reviewer: u/Longjumping-Ad-2931 \[2/10\] They were excited to try this cart but disappointed as it didn‚Äôt work properly, unlike their positive experience with Neon Sunshine; issues included it only functioning if barely screwed on, falling out, and the preheat stopping with an error, leading them to return it for another product after unsuccessful troubleshooting.

# 10. Green Joy üî•üî•üî•üî• 45

1mk5jir,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1mk5jir/just_joined_the_club_gaggia_accademia/,Just joined the club - Gaggia Accademia,"I've only had it a few days, but so far so good.

Initial setup was quick, and I was enjoying freshly ""brewed"" cups within about 30 minutes.

I like the separate ""hopper"" for ground coffee, as my wife doesn't drink regular coffee, so when she wants a latt√©, I can just use pre-ground decaf.

I also like the separate milk jug that I can just pop back into the fridge when not needed.

Already I have noticed that the internal water/drip tray seems to fill up quickly. I wish it drained into the main (detachable) drip tray, or that there was some way to route it. As it is, the internal tray fills up quickly, but the puck ""bin"" only has a handful of pucks in it.

The brew group is really easy to pop out and clean/lube (although I haven't needed to do that yet).

The screen is really clear & crisp, but it seems the UI is sometimes super-responsive to a finger press, and sometimes not.

So, overall, first impressions are good.",2,1754585939.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1mk5j82,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mk5j82/why_choose_the_ninja_ce251_coffee_maker_for/,Why Choose the Ninja CE251 Coffee Maker for Perfect Morning Brews?,"Testing out the Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB coffee maker has been an unexpectedly enjoyable journey. As someone who drinks coffee every single day, I‚Äôve developed a finely tuned appreciation for what makes a good coffee machine stand out. This particular brewer isn‚Äôt just your average coffee maker. It combines practicality with a polished design that caught my eye the moment I unpacked it. The clean stainless steel finish is sleek and subtle, blending into both modern and traditional kitchen aesthetics. Plus, its compact shape fit neatly onto my slightly overcrowded counter without me having to rearrange half my kitchen.

**Ease of Setup and Design**  
Setting this coffee maker up was refreshingly simple. I personally despise overly complicated appliances that leave you staring at a user manual for hours. Fortunately, this machine‚Äôs controls were straightforward and intuitive. The buttons are well-labeled, making programming effortless even before I finished my first cup of caffeine for the day. Its reusable filter means I don‚Äôt have to keep buying paper filters‚Äîa huge win for convenience and sustainability. The removable water reservoir was another thoughtful touch. I could fill it right at the sink without awkward maneuvers, and its 60-oz capacity meant I didn‚Äôt need to constantly refill it throughout the day with back-to-back brewing sessions.   

[Check Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b07ztyztj5/)  

**Two Brewing Modes for Varied Preferences**  
One of the features that immediately stood out to me is the dual brew modes. I‚Äôm one of those people who like a mild cup in the morning but prefer a thicker, richer brew when I need that 3 PM energy hit. Having the option to brew both classic or rich allowed me to switch based on my mood or the occasion. Bonus points because neither option tastes watery or over-bitter like low-end machines often produce. Brewing smaller batches (1-4 cups) didn‚Äôt compromise the flavor either, thanks to its small-batch setting that prevents dilution‚Äîideal for days when I just wanted one cup instead of enough to fuel a small office. The consistency got me tweaking my coffee routine to experiment more often, which I genuinely enjoyed.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Customizable brew strengths (classic and rich) to suit diverse tastes.  
- Small-batch mode delivers undiluted flavor even with 1-4 cups.  
- Programmable 24-hour timer for convenient, wake-up-ready caffeine.  

**Performance and Temperature Control**  
One thing I'll give Ninja credit for is making sure your coffee stays hot without burning. I tested the adjustable warming plate with a 12-cup brew, and my coffee stayed warm and pleasant-tasting for around 4 hours, give or take. The brewing technology on this machine is no joke‚Äîthe advanced boiler does indeed produce a hotter cup of coffee compared to other brewers I‚Äôve owned (and burned through) in the past. This feature especially shone during cold mornings where lukewarm coffee would‚Äôve been utterly disappointing. Even the aroma that wafts through the room during brewing felt richer, promising a great coffee experience before I‚Äôd even taken a sip.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The machine can be a little noisy, especially during the brewing cycle.  
- Cleaning the carafe spout thoroughly requires some extra effort.  
- Some users may find the size inappropriate for tighter countertops.  

**User-Friendliness and Automation**  
The programmable 24-hour timer felt like a game-changer. Imagine setting this thing up the night before, rolling out of bed half-asleep, and being greeted by fresh coffee without even pressing a button. Pure bliss. I tried this feature on multiple days, and it worked flawlessly each time. The fully automatic operation and tactile buttons make it accessible for everyone‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre a tech wizard or someone who struggles with overly digitized interfaces. And while it doesn‚Äôt come bundled with smart assistant compatibility, the programming available is more than sufficient for most daily routines.  

**Product Comparisons**  
If you‚Äôre curious about other coffee makers in the market, it‚Äôs worth comparing this with something like the Keurig K-Elite or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. While single-serve machines like the Keurig offer convenience, I‚Äôve always felt that they fall short when you want a rich, fuller-bodied coffee. The Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB‚Äôs dual modes outperformed these competitors in flavor depth and brewing precision, particularly for large batches. Hamilton Beach‚Äôs FlexBrew offers versatility with both single-serve and carafe brewing, but it feels less refined in build quality compared to Ninja‚Äôs polished stainless exterior. For advanced temperature control, the Ninja edged out others on my test bench.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Without diving into exact numbers, this coffee maker falls into the mid-range when it comes to coffee machine pricing. And honestly? It‚Äôs worth every drop of investment if you‚Äôre a regular coffee drinker. Yes, I did find a few areas for improvement, like the occasional noise. But the performance, features, and durability make this product an excellent value proposition. It‚Äôs not just about brewing coffee; it‚Äôs about making your mornings (and afternoons) smoother and more enjoyable every single day.

1mk5iw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mk5iw2/can_the_cuisinart_coffee_center_4in1_maker_truly/,Can the Cuisinart Coffee Center 4-In-1 Maker Truly Upgrade Your Mornings?,"Testing the Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS 4-in-1 Coffee Center has been quite the caffeinated journey. It‚Äôs a machine that promised to bring the coffeehouse experience right into my kitchen, and I was eager to see if it could live up to its bold claims. Thanks to its unique 4-in-1 design, it doesn‚Äôt just stop at being a drip coffee maker; it can also be your single-serve brewer, espresso machine, and milk frother. All these features, packed into one sleek device, had my curiosity piqued.

**Design and Build Quality**

Outwardly, this coffee maker boasts a modern and compact design. Its black exterior with solid finishing exudes a professional vibe that feels at home in any kitchen. At 14 pounds and with dimensions measuring 11.88""D x 12.88""W x 16.75""H, it doesn‚Äôt eat up too much counter space. The buttons are tactile, and the interface is straightforward enough for a first-time user like my cousin, who had no trouble figuring out how to brew his favorite espresso. However, I did notice that the steam wand attachment could feel slightly fragile over time, but that‚Äôs not a major deal-breaker.

**Versatility and Features**

The versatility of this machine quickly became its star feature. With its drip coffee option, I programmed it the night before to wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee‚Äîan absolute blessing for my morning routine. It can handle up to 12 cups in the carafe, and the coffee strength control lets you choose between a light, medium, or bold brew. 

The single-serve side caters to lovers of convenience, accommodating K-cup pods and offering three brewing size options‚Äî6oz, 8oz, and 10oz. Plus, it‚Äôs compatible with Nespresso Original Line-style capsules, something my espresso-obsessed friend went crazy for. The steam wand? That came in handy for whipping up frothy milk for my lattes and even heating water for my instant soup cravings. Despite its multifunctionality, some might find switching between the features a tad clunky.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**

From my experience, this coffee maker delivers solid drip coffee and single-serve options. The programmable timer worked seamlessly, making my early mornings caffeine-efficient. The Brew Pause feature also allowed me to sneak a cup mid-cycle without making a mess, which not all drip machines nail perfectly. However, the espresso could‚Äôve been punched up a notch in terms of richness; it‚Äôs decent but doesn‚Äôt wholly compete with dedicated espresso machines. 

The milk frother, while excellent for cappuccinos, sometimes leaves a bit of residue behind, so a quick rinse after every use became mandatory. It‚Äôs worth noting that the gold-tone permanent filter and charcoal water filter work well to elevate the flavor by eliminating impurities.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**

Getting this 4-in-1 coffee machine up and running was straightforward, although setting the programmable features took me a moment to figure out without consulting the manual. Cleaning was mostly hassle-free, thanks to the reusable filter and the removable drip tray. Any coffee machine, however, needs love and regular cleaning to function optimally. If you‚Äôre someone who wants zero maintenance, this machine might require slightly more effort with its multiple functions‚Äîespecially the steam wand, which benefits from proper care to perform well long-term.

**Highlights**

- Provides drip coffee, single-serve options, and milk frothing in one machine.
- Programmable brewing timer and adjustable coffee strength add convenience.
- Compact design works well for smaller kitchens.
- Compatible with K-cups and Nespresso capsules.
- Brew Pause feature allows mid-cycle interruptions.

**Critiques**

- Espresso quality isn‚Äôt as robust as specialized machines.
- Steam wand feels slightly fragile and needs consistent cleaning.
- Switching between functions might feel unintuitive for some.
- The milk frother can leave slight residue.

**Competing Brands**

In a market crowded with multifunctional coffee machines, models like Keurig K-Caf√© and Breville Barista Express come close in features. Keurig is perfect for those purely focused on single-serve options, but it lacks the espresso game this machine brings. Breville, on the other hand, outshines with its espresso quality and build but has a steeper learning curve and higher price point. This model offers a middle ground for those wanting a mix of versatility and affordability in one package.

**Value for Money**

This isn‚Äôt a basic coffee maker; it‚Äôs an all-in-one unit targeting those who need a diverse coffee experience without investing in multiple machines. Its price point sits comfortably in the midrange, reflecting its multifunctional capabilities while maintaining affordability. Compared to assembling a coffee station with separate appliances, this machine is a solid investment for coffee lovers seeking versatility. You might compromise a bit on espresso richness, but what it offers in convenience outweighs that. As someone who has tested numerous machines, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the cost for its range of features.

Wide, sturdy bases provide better support than narrow, delicate ones.Consider the weight capacity of your flooring, especially if you are placing the table on hardwood or carpeting, to prevent any potential damage.

Yes, there are different grades of marble, which vary in terms of color, veining, and purity. High-grade marble, such as Calacatta, is rarer and more expensive due to its extraordinary beauty and quality.

Lower-grade marble, such as Carrara, is more readily available and thus more affordable. The grade of marble influences the table's overall appearance, durability, and price. When choosing a marble coffee table, consider your budget and aesthetic preferences.

1mk5i0x,https://i.redd.it/g69nrq99omhf1.png,[Whiskey Review #143] Jura The Road,"Jura is a whisky brand originating from an island of the same name. Even the full name of the island and the whisky are the same: Isle of Jura. It is located in the Hebrides, west of Scotland, and has 35 inhabited islands and 44 uninhabited ones. The largest islands in this area are Skye, Mull, and Islay, and a population of just under 20,000.

The distillery was founded in 1810 and, as is often the case, fell into disuse, but I don't have an exact date for its demise. However, it was remodeled in 1884 and by 1900 had fallen into disuse again. In the 1950s, the distillery was renovated, and by 1963, the renovation was completed. In 1985, it was acquired by Invergordon Distillers, a company that was later acquired by Whyte & Mackay in 1993. Invergordon also owns Bruichladdich and Tullibardine.

Although the brand's origins and style may be quite typical, there is a scandal surrounding it that has made it less than beloved. The scandal concerns a fraudulent scheme involving the sale of whisky casks, in which investors lost significant amounts of money due to false statements and the possible nonexistence of these casks. The scam was orchestrated by individuals associated with Cask Whisky LTD. Although Jura was not the only distillery involved in the affair, it was perhaps one of the most prominent brands.

This whisky is called The Road and it pays tribute to the only road that exists in Jura. Many Jura products pay tribute to parts of the island, such as the bay, the lake, the river, the weather, etc. This is a NAS but mentions that it's aged in ex-bourbon casks and then finished in a cask that held a 20-year-old Pedro Xim√©nez. It's bottled at 43.6% ABV.

Made by: Isle of Jura Distillery  
Name of the whisky: The Road  
Brand: Jura  
Origin: Isle of Jura, Scotland  
Age: NAS  
Price: $65

**Nose:** I'm struck by how creamy and dairy it feels on the nose, with aromas that remind me of yogurt or feta cheese. Then there are also intense aromas of stone fruits, such as peach or plum, but also mango, followed by almonds and cinnamon. There's also a hint of smoke, and I think it's certainly less than in other Juras I've tried.

**Palate:** The palate is much smokier, but there are aromas of wood smoke and burnt bread. Then there's some almond and coffee beans, but very little of the fruit flavor promised on the label, unless it's just a scent. Herbal notes are also present.

**Retrohale/Finish:** In the aftertaste there are flavors of wood and nuts.

**Rating:** 6 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** Although this whisky appears straightforward on paper, repeating some of the aromas on the palate, during the tasting I was struck by how unstraightforward it was. Indeed, the aromas and flavors are quite distinct, especially in terms of intensity. I've seen quite varied prices for this whisky, and the fact that it's a Travel Exclusive could be one of the reasons, but in truth, none of them seem justified to me.

 For a while I was questioning if I was in fact demi since I actually have a really high sex drive but now I'm seeing how it really plays out in my world. 

I have a crush.

A big, came out of nowhere but is now suddenly ""consuming-all-my-thoughts-can't-wait-to-see-them-again"" crush. 

It didn't start that way. But it came on hot and suddenly.

While he is definitely a good-- great-- looking guy,  I had kind of written him off as not really my type of attractive because he's very in shape and I judgementally judged him to be someone without a lot of depth who cares more about appearance than substance.

 But then...
Then we started having conversations.

First it was just cool to have interesting conversations while I worked out to distract me. He's my trainer. 
We started geeking out together over certain topics that seemed to make us both come alive a bit in our sessions. Made me actually look forward to going to the gym!

And then he started sharing his journey about--- well, about discovering/ bettering himself. 

And that's like sexual catnip to me. (And no he wasn't doing this to try to impress/seduce. He seems just as surprised that he shared a lot of this with me as I am )

 Suddenly I was addicted. And it happened so fast. One day he was just trainer dude and the next, BAM! 

I started to fantasize about seeing him again what it would be like if i started to to subtly flirt with hin and see if he flirts back. And fantasize about the conversations we might have and how it might progress to texting and maybe coffee get togethers where we talk and get to know each other.

But it's not sexual fantasies AT ALL. No matter how much I try.  And believe me, I've tried. 

It's just fantasies about in person conversations, texting that may start to happen. Bantering. 

The slow burn.

I can't even fantasize about kissing him.

 But there is no denying the pulsing desire and aliveness in my system that only comes from a spark of sapio-demi connection.

That mix of intelligence/wisdom AND emotional + spiritual self awareness is HOT.

And it's addicting AF

And I've realized that's been most of crushes most of my life. Fantasizing about our next interactions and rarely sexual in nature at first.

I hope you guys enjoy it!!

‚Äî

Policemen. Policemen. Policemen.

I never knew I‚Äôd somehow end up in the position that I am in now. First, in the police department - merely a rookie wet behind the ears, now in a tiny shoebox that Russell - my boss - had made just for me ‚Äî a cosy little thing lined in felt, silk, and cotton - anything that could keep me warm and comfortable.

But here I am.

Tiny. Safe. Secure.

Come to think of it, I never anticipated that Russell would even pay attention to me in the first place, took a favouritism towards me in the way that he did. 

The lingering stares, the attention, humouring me, the way his eyes lingered on me, and of course, let‚Äôs not forget the countless of times the fabric of his trousers shifted as he stared at me. 

Yes. I noticed.

And of course ‚Äî the way my colleagues said that he was a massive DILF in a ‚Äúso-much-of-a-bastard-he‚Äôs-hot-sort-of-way‚Äù ‚Äî which was a whole entertaining thing in itself.

And then life came and said ‚Äúfuck that.‚Äù 

Whilst I was at a promotion meeting that he had organised towards the very end of the day of one shift, something happened to me that I would never forget. 

Mysteriously, I shrunk down to the size of a few inches, if that. The size of an insect. 

Maybe some curse. Maybe some kind of disease. Or just a turn of fate.

(Which, unfortunately, Rus hasn‚Äôt had any luck reversing the effect despite extensive research.)

And him?

When he discovered me, I remember how my heart burst out from my chest - from fear, from relief, maybe‚Ä¶ arousal. I thought that he would live up to his title that circulated the bureau - that he was, in fact, a twat like everyone said. 

But they were - well, let‚Äôs put it this way - half-right. 

Of course they were.

However, I didn‚Äôt expect Russell to react in the way that he did.

Freaked out at first.

How he bent down, teased me a little before seeing the fear in my eyes, how he picked me up between his index and pointer finger like a piece of glass. Going complete ‚Äúprotective, big chief‚Äù mode.

Like the good chief he was, instead he took me underneath his wing as his ‚Äúsecret little weapon‚Äù, his favourite rookie. Carrying me around on shifts like a little pocket snack, in all matter of places ‚Äî his shirt pocket, underneath his hat.

Oh yeah. And let‚Äôs not the dreaded belt incident.

That almost destroyed me.

Things had been different lately, especially now. Today, Russell decided to keep me home ‚Äî the work beginning to ramp up, endless recruit training, paperwork, presentations, etc. all whilst balancing the work with getting me back to some state of normalcy. 

I feel sorry for him. Poor man doesn‚Äôt deserve to be burdened with such things.

And most importantly, I miss him. Miss that cheeky trademark shit-eating grin that I‚Äôve come to know and love, that gorgeous face, that massive bod, that unique accent, all the ways he would make me flail and squirm.

Nevertheless, he should be coming through the door any minute now. This is around the same time he comes home every night. Perhaps he‚Äôs just running late.

 My heart races to a fever pitch in anticipation.

I scramble up the side of some cotton buds stacked on top of each other, peering out into the city-like landscape that is Russell‚Äôs sprawling house. Hands on the edge of my makeshift home, I look over at the front door ‚Äî which now seems miles away.

And then‚Ä¶

The sound of steps coming up to the door makes my breath pause momentarily. Strong, sturdy steps.

Russell‚Äôs steps.

Some keys jangle. 

Click.

Click.

The air weighs down momentarily, the thought of seeing Russell needling in my spine ‚Äî dull, insistent. 

Immediately, my heart begins to accelerate, and a smile begins to form on my face as the door shudders, swinging on its hinges.

Revealing Russell standing there.

Crow‚Äôs feet. Blonde, tousled hair greying in some sections, a smattering of dirty blonde dense facial hair, those glasses, the scars. The bulky, functional, barrel-chested body.

That‚Äôs him alright. Russell Monty. In the flesh.

He saunters over, absentmindedly placing his askew police cap on the table haphazardly. The giant shrugs his huge jacket to the ground before hanging it on a nearby rack. He slides his battered boots off, leaving him in only his uniform.

A navy polo shirt with his badge on, an onyx tie done messily, with the top button undone. A pair of trousers with a leather belt. 

He yawns. Sleep has crept up to his green eyes, heavy and weary - rubbing them. His shirt is untucked, stains pooling on his armpits and chest. There‚Äôs also another - maybe whiskey or coffee.

That‚Äôs how I know he‚Äôs tired.

He begins to walk towards me. My heart accelerates with each step that reverberates loudly underneath his socks - the floorboards creaking, which seems like mini-earthquakes at my size. Instinctively, I slink back into the shoebox, seeking the thrill of wanting him to find me again. 

Eventually, he reaches the shoebox. Gently, he tilts it ever so slightly with his hand. My body falls to the side that is closest to him, scrabbling for purchase as cotton buds the size of small boulders and felt begins to slip.

His breath - warm, tinged with coffee - runs over me. I look up at him, an award-winning smile playing on my lips as my gaze lingers on his features.

His eyes crinkle, trying his best to stay awake. And he speaks:

‚ÄúMmm‚Ä¶ Good evenin‚Äô, rook,‚Äù he murmurs lowly, exhaustion lowering his voice an octave in a way that makes me involuntarily squeal with excitement. 

The Australian-Scottish lilt and brogues come out in full force tonight. Strong.

‚ÄúGood evening, Rus,‚Äù I reply with a wry grin forming on my face, an enormous finger the size of a school bus coming down to affectionately boop my nose. 

I giggle.

‚ÄúWhat a fuckin‚Äô day,‚Äù he groans, yawning once again. His muscles stretch, his back cracks audibly as the worries of the day begin to fade away with me, ‚ÄúWork was an absolute bastard today, I tell ye, pipsqueak.‚Äù

With a giant hand, Russell then grabs the shoebox ‚Äî dwarfing it entirely. He tilts it upside-down delicately, emptying me onto his waiting palm. Hot, calloused, and square-shaped.

‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù

Russell sighs loudly, rubbing the bridge of his crooked nose with his other hand.

‚ÄúIt was a fuckin‚Äô nightmare, I tell ye,‚Äù he begins, his voice taking on something akin to extreme exhaustion and relief, ‚Äúthe Mayor had a whole presentation about keeping the community safe and healthy living, some shite like that. Then the recruits‚Ä¶ Oh the recruits. The new ones especially act like they need their fuckin‚Äô hands held - a huge handful, and the paperwork?‚Äù

Russell shakes his head, trembling slightly. A deep sound, akin to a brrr, one of annoyance - one of sheer pain, escapes from his lips.

He then looks at me, his gaze lighting up away from a more somber note to a reverent one.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ just glad that ‚Äòs over‚Ä¶‚Äù He admits, pulling me closer so that I‚Äôm against his chest - his pectorals bulging through the fabric of his shirt. ‚ÄúAnd now‚Ä¶ I get to enjoy the best part of me fuckin‚Äô day, and that‚Äôs you, my favourite rookie.‚Äù

My heart skips a beat, and I begin to blush furiously. Russell‚Äôs body heat is like a furnace ‚Äî solid, bulky, and mine. He nuzzles his head into me, heartbeat pounding in his chest like a sonorous war drum. He purrs.

‚ÄúYer blushing already? Miss me that much, eh?‚Äù He chuckles, his chest bouncing up and down as he cuddles me. Then, Russell tosses me one of his shit-eating grins - but this time, not out of malice.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed ya, Rus‚Ä¶ Missed ya so much.‚Äù I reply, fingers tracing along the hardened callouses ‚Äî he‚Äôs so impossibly careful with me, as if he‚Äôs worried to accidentally squish or crush me.

‚ÄúMmm, that‚Äôs what I love to hear‚Ä¶‚Äù He pulls me closer to his chest, hot breath washing over me like a blanket. Tinged with the faint smell of coffee, ‚ÄúI missed ya too, me lil‚Äô Dan. So fuckin‚Äô much. I know we haven‚Äôt got to spend that much time together‚Ä¶ This week has just been rough, y‚Äôknow? I‚Äôll promise I‚Äôll make it up to ya, ‚Äòlright pipsqueak?‚Äù

He cracks his shoulders and back again.

I nod, snuggling deeper into his embrace like a heat-seeking missile. His hand around me is more than enough to shield me from the world - a firm pressure around the lower half of my body. He smiles.

‚ÄúI know things haven‚Äôt been easy, Rus‚Ä¶ I know. I know. They haven‚Äôt been easy for either of us, especially this week. Feel sorry for you, really.‚Äù

He guffaws softly, a deep rumble in his broad, expansive chest as he looms over me, his presence as overwhelming as ever. He leans in closer, so close that I can see each golden whisker of facial hair ‚Äî now mere inches away from my tiny face, his green irises glinting with a mix of weariness and warmth behind his glasses.

‚ÄúAwww, ya feel sorry for yer ol‚Äô Chief, do ya? Well ain‚Äôt that sweet of ya.‚Äù

His voice is a low, teasing murmur, his Aussie-Scottish accent sending shivers racing down my spine. He reaches out with a finger on his free hand, gently booping my nose ‚Äî the pads large enough to cover the entirety of my face and then some more. His touch remains gentle and careful despite his immense size.

‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt worry yer pretty little head about ol‚Äô Rus, eh? I‚Äôm made of tougher stuff than that. Survived worse weeks than this, I tell ya.‚Äù

He straightens back up to his full, towering height, his shirt stretching taut over his muscular back as he stretches. He glances around the room before his gaze settles back on me, a mischievous glint in his eye. 

‚ÄúTell ya what though, since this week‚Äôs been a right pain in the arse for the both of us, what do ya say we have ourselves a proper relax tonight, eh? I reckon fixing a nice, hot shower and a cuddle might do us some good‚Ä¶‚Äù

With that, he shifts me so that I‚Äôm right in front of his devastatingly handsome face. His eyes weary behind the frame of his specs.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it gonna be, ya lil‚Äô shrimp? Fancy a night in with the big guy, yeah? I promise I‚Äôll be on me best behaviour‚Ä¶‚Äù

He winks salaciously. 

‚ÄúWell, mostly.‚Äù

A beat.

‚ÄúNo promises on the cuddles though ‚Äî I can‚Äôt help meself when ya get me goin‚Äô like that, ya cheeky lil‚Äô minx.‚Äù",1,1754585478.0,gianttiny,0,1.0,False

1mk58ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobhunting/comments/1mk58ah/taking_a_job_with_a_slightly_lower_pay/,Taking a job with a slightly lower pay,"
Hi there, I make 140k today at a startup at a Senior IC level -  I have been here for 4 years and as of recent have felt less happy and motivated at work, and burnt out from the fully remote position, leadership doubts and change exhaustion. We had large layoffs a few months ago as well which definitely caused morale to go down. 

I received an offer from what has historically been a dream company of mine, highly established large tech company with a great office in nyc. That said, the offer will be 20k lower in base salary (but offers equity) at a junior IC level, and this is the very top of their band that I already negotiated to. They have way more benefits (free coffee, breakfast & lunch, hybrid schedule, 401k match, bonus, wellness stipend, etc).

The lower base and level downgrade stings, but I think looking at the offer more holistically and the room for growth makes it more appealing. Additionally, I love my current manager and would say that would be the toughest thing to leave along with some great colleagues.

I feel so torn - do I take this new offer?? ",2,1754585222.0,jobhunting,4,1.0,False
1mk57m3,https://i.redd.it/t6wobx37mmhf1.jpeg,[Rum Review #167] Car√∫pano 21 Solera Centenaria,"A rum born in the land that gives the brand its name: Car√∫pano, in the state of Sucre, Car√∫pano is still a family-owned company that competes with the big boys of Santa Teresa, Pampero, Cacique and the like. They currently have around eight different products. This Car√∫pano 21 was launched in 1993 as a 45% ABV rum, a marked difference from most Venezuelan rums, which are usually bottled at 40%. It is a rum with a six-year base and a maximum of 21 years of age.

For many, it's known today as ""the old"" Carupano 21, since a couple of years ago (or less) it was replaced by a transparent bottle with a design more in line with the brand's other products. However, this change also saw it reformulated, and its alcohol content was reduced to 40%. 

The brand maintains that this reformulation is limited solely to adding more water to the mix, which lowers the percentage from 45% to 40%. This is something I don't believe, as both taste completely different and the new one feels very sweetened, but that's for another review. 

A couple of errors or details about this bottle are that it's made by Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano, which isn't a distillery but rather buys spirits. It's also called Solera Centenaria, but it's not made using the solera process. It's a column-distilled spirit aged between 6 and 21 years. It is bottled at 45% ABV.

Made by: Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano  
Name of the rum: 21 Solera Centenaria  
Brand: Car√∫pano  
Origin: Venezuela  
Age: 6 to 21 years  
Price: $20 (when available, since it's discontinued, around $45)

**Nose:** Orange peel, brown sugar, toasted coconut, strawberries, hazelnuts, tobacco, vanilla, and toasted caramel are present. There's also a hint that I could describe as milky, or rather creamy, like that of a cheesecake.

**Palate:** Dark chocolate, vanilla, cheesecake, Christmas cake, toasted wood, and caramel are immediate, but they linger long after the finish. 

**Retrohale/Finish:** The aftertaste is dominated by coffee, tobacco, and grapefruit peel.

**Rating:** 10 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** I have a sommelier friend who says the elimination of this rum from the Venezuelan market is one of his biggest disappointments in the national rum industry. I'm hard-pressed to disagree, but he has his reasons. I'd rather see the production of this rum continue, even if it's a limited edition, while maintaining its flavor and quality.

The Old Car√∫pano 21 is a spectacular rum for smoking, especially with medium-to-high strength cigars with good flavor intensity, as they are difficult to surpass by rum, with which it pairs very well. Several are still available, and it becomes something to share with friends, both for the few bottles available and for information on where to get them.



English is not my first language and most of my reviews have been posted originally in Spanish, and later translated into English, so I apologize if they sometimes sound *mechanical*. On reddit I'm aiming to review mostly Venezuelan rums, but I post a bit of everything. You can check out the rest of my reviews (in Spanish) on [my blog](https://humoytabaco.com/), including rum, whisk(e)y, agave, gin and cigars. I also have an Instagram account [in Spanish](https://www.instagram.com/robleytabaco/) as well and another one [in English](https://www.instagram.com/oaknsmokes/), where I'll regularly update video reviews.

So I thought: what if I could turn Reddit threads directly into clean, structured articles with zero effort?

Cue two weekends, too much coffee, and a Gemini API key later ‚Äî I hacked together **ThreadSmith**.

Here‚Äôs what it does:

* Input any Reddit thread URL üîó
* Pick from a few AI prompt styles (summary, blog, Q&A, etc)
* Hit generate ‚Üí Boom. A Markdown file with cleaned-up, structured content.
* Works offline. No browser extensions or jank.

And it‚Äôs not just a summary bot ‚Äî it **preserves tone, nuance, and depth**, especially for longform or controversial threads.

I priced it cheap ($5.99 for the first 500 users) because I wasn‚Äôt sure if anyone would care.  
But turns out‚Ä¶ people **really** wanted something like this.

It‚Äôs now a desktop app with:

* Support for Google Gemini models (custom or default)

1mk55kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALawyer/comments/1mk55kl/minnesotase_metro_employment_law_ada/,[Minnesota][SE Metro] Employment Law ‚Äî ADA Accommodations,"Just wondering if this is worth reporting and/consulting an attorney about.

TLDR: I requested a reasonable ADA accommodation and was denied because it is ‚Äúagainst office policy.‚Äù

Background: 

ADA Qualification:  I have been diagnosed with CPTSD, anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Amongst the usual struggles of being easily distracted, becoming extremely fatigued when I am bored, and struggling to focus on extremely boring tasks‚Ä¶my anxiety is what is really limiting. I get severe panic attacks which cause me to cry uncontrollably, cause me to freeze to the point that hours will pass and I won‚Äôt even notice, and cause really embarrassing stress diarrhea.

Office Environment: I work for a county agency where the head of the office is an elected official. There are basically 2 levels to my agency. It‚Äôs hard to describe without giving the whole thing away, so I‚Äôll just call them ‚Äústaff‚Äù and ‚Äúsupport staff.‚Äù Staff has regular in person meetings. Support staff is never required for those in person meetings. The public access is extremely limited, and any member of the public who attempts to visit or contact our office is very unlikely to get past the front desk unless they have a specific reason to contact an employee. The vast majority of our work is done online and via paperless means.

I work in a cubicle where there are very harsh fluorescent lights at all four corners of the cubicle. I was told that I got this cubicle because the last 3 occupants had requested to move due to the harshness of the lighting.

There are no break rooms. There is an employee kitchen with a fridge, microwave, sink, and coffee maker that support staff are expected to clean. There is no seating or even standing room in the kitchen.

There are almost no exterior windows except for the ones in staff offices. There is one conference room at the opposite end of a hallway from my area that has windows, and there is one window in the employee kitchen.

There are over 100 employees, the vast majority of which are women. There is only one women‚Äôs restroom with 2 stalls. There are other restrooms in the building, but they are outside of our office area and are either shared with other agencies or are fully public.

Policies: I was hired approximately 10 months ago. At that time, I was told I would be able to work from home 3 days per week. By the time the hiring process was complete, the policy had changed to 2 remote days per week. The county-wide policy is 3 remote days per week. 

About 2 months ago, my office announced that they were moving to a 1 day remote policy for all ‚Äúnon-staff‚Äù employees. This policy change has not been applied equally across all non-staff positions.

We are allowed to decorate our cubicles, but we are not allowed to make ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù changes to the cubicles.

Events: I was really struggling with the lighting. It was giving me headaches and really wearing me out. I was having a hard time staying awake at my desk and had a hard time staying focused on my work. 

I bought a very small shade to put over my monitors. I was very quickly stopped and told that the shade was against office policy and qualified as a substantial change. My direct supervisor is very understanding, but this policy was given above her. She asked what I was trying to do. I explained to her the lighting situation. She said she would see if she could get someone to approve the shade. The person above her said no, and issued me a set of big, horrible, sun glasses. I can‚Äôt see my monitors through them. Even if they did do what they want, I am so embarrassed to wear them. I was already feeling panicky because I am such a rule follower. When I saw the glasses and the two higher up people who had followed her to make sure I was issued the sunglasses, I went into a full panic attack. I started sobbing and shaking. She took me into an office of a staff member who was working from home and let me calm down. 

I get into trouble for a lot of really silly things. I wear noise cancelling headphones to help me stayed focused, but I get in trouble if I forget to take them off when I leave my cubicle. I got in trouble for having a personal laptop that was closed and charging. They said it looked like I would be doing personal work on company time. I got in trouble for not being at my desk 10 minutes before my shift. I got in trouble for staying 10 minutes past the end of my shift. I got in trouble for wearing a scarf when it was cold. It just goes on and on. I feel really scrutinized constantly which triggers my anxiety. 

I was doing okay with the 2 days remote. I would work from home on Tuesday and Fridays. That worked well for me because it gave me a chance to decompress and work in a stress free environment. Tuesdays gave me the midweek break. Most people are in the office on Wednesdays, so I didn‚Äôt want to be home that day. And any department meetings and/or one-on-ones are on Thursdays, so I can‚Äôt have that day be a consistent wfh day. But Friday, a lot of people take that day off and the ‚Äúmeeting house‚Äù for the staff is closed‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a great day to buckle down and plow through a ton of stuff in an environment where I can really focus and not be stressed.

Since the new policy, my symptoms have gotten worse. I have severe headaches. I had to up my adhd meds, but I am still feeling sleepy/groggy at my desk. My legs feel achy and gross because I‚Äôm so tense. However, I made the mistake of putting my feet on my file cabinet to stretch my legs out while I worked one day‚Ä¶.i got into big trouble for that. The constant fear of being in trouble and the inability to focus and feeling like I‚Äôm being watched all of the time has made my stress diarrhea so bad. I spent a half hour in the bathroom just today. It‚Äôs so embarrassing because, with only 2 stalls, people come in an out constantly and try the door. I try to hide my feet so no one can see my shoes and know it‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs just embarrassing. And on the other hand, if I go in there and both stalls are full, I have to scramble to find an out of office bathroom that isn‚Äôt occupied. 

I‚Äôve had to increase my anxiety med intake. I was taking maybe 2-3 gabapentin pills per month. Now I‚Äôm up to 1-3 per week. 

 
Request:
I put in an ADA accommodation request from my HR department. I requested 2-3 wfh days per week with a set schedule. I requested to wfh Tuesdays and Fridays and every other Thursday. I had to fill out a bunch of forms describing why I was requesting it and had to go into a bunch of detail about my symptoms. My therapist had to fill out a form and submit it. 

I stated that 2-3 days per week makes me the most effective employee I can be. I‚Äôm capable of performing all of my necessary duties, but I‚Äôm struggling being in the office this much. I‚Äôve already shown that I can effectively do my work from home. I already have the equipment necessary to work from home. It would cost the office nothing. It wouldn‚Äôt change my work at all. And the staff members that I support are also working from home 2-3 days per week.

I was denied stating that it was against the office policy. They offered to modify my cubicle lighting, allow me a shade for my monitors, and said if I have a panic attack I can use another office. The office they offered me to use is on the complete other side of the office and requires me to go to the front desk to request a key. Also, it already has a purpose for which it is regularly in use. I requested that they reconsider because it didn‚Äôt seem reasonable. I stated that the offered accommodations would strip me off my privacy. Also, why are they willing to change the policies regarding modifying the cubicle but not willing to be flexible with the wfh policy? One costs the county money and affects all of the people around me. The other costs the county zero dollars and affects no one. 

They said they would discuss it, but they came back saying this was all they could offer, that I need to try it for a few months. 

I understand that under ADA my employer is not required to give me exactly what I ask for. They are only required to offer a reasonable accommodation. But it seems really unreasonable to expect me, when in the middle of a panic attack, to run across an office, request a key to a room that is hopefully unoccupied, and not only calm down in that room but prep myself to have to come out of the room to face a bunch of people and try not to have another panic attack triggered by the embarrassment‚Ä¶when I could sit in my desk at home, not leave my computer, breathe through the attack, and continue with my work.

Anyway, is this worth even consulting an attorney about? I don‚Äôt want to be *that* employee, but I am honestly feeling my chest tighten up just thinking about this.

1mk51o4,https://i.redd.it/hi0z9voflmhf1.jpeg,Aug 1-5 Recap: Double Rainbow (and so many wonderful memories!) at the Beach Club,"We took a gamble on a great deal from David's to stay at the Beach Club for \~$400/night from August 1-5. To be honest, I felt quite anxious leading up to it because of the high heat and humidity. I'm happy to report that the trip went wonderfully, and we made beautiful memories with our almost two-year-old!

8/1: we flew in, checked into our hotel. We planned to hit stormalong bay but our flight was delayed, so by the time we actually got to BC, we ended up calling it an early night. We booked a deluxe studio in the DVC room, and it was perfect! Highly recommend ordering grocery delivery in advance: all we had to do was grab the grocery bags from Bell Services (they had refrigerated everything for us!) and bring them to our room, where we stored them in the mini-fridge. Fresh fruit for my berry-loving toddler, yogurt, cold brew coffee? Yes please!

8/2: we ate a leisurely breakfast at the BC marketplace (Mickey waffles, hooray!), went for a walk around Crescent Lake, people-watched at the Boardwalk (at 9am there were already tons of people lining up at the Cake Bake Shop, which I was surprised by! Not my type of place, but to each their own.), and watched the Skyliner. We then hit Stormalong Bay, where my toddler was DELIGHTED by the sandy-bottom pool. We had packed sand toys for her to play with; I highly recommend doing this! When we got too hot, we took an afternoon break for toddler to nap, and then explored the BC and YC lobbies hunting for Flounder and Max. Then, we took the Skyliner to Riviera, where we had reservations at Topolino's. Get the creme brulee tiramisu and an espresso martini, and thank me later!

8/3: we impulse-purchased one-day tickets to Epcot. In the morning, we rope-dropped Remy, and also hit Soaring (they now have a rider-swap in a dedicated room right next to the ride, which made things super easy!), Living with the Land, and Nemo. We had a walk-in lunch at Shiki-Sai (a light and cold sushi lunch on a hot day was very refreshing!), then headed back to BC for a nap and rest. We went back out around 6pm, when things were starting to cool off, and rode Journey into Imagination, Spaceship Earth, and 3 Caballeros. Sadly, Frozen was closed for most of the day and when it reopened, it stayed at a 45-minute plus wait and we just couldn't make ourselves do that with a toddler in tow. Next time, for sure. We also let toddler blow off some steam by playing on the outdoor playground outside Connections, and she loved it! We had an 8:15 window view reservation at La Hacienda de San Angel Inn, which meant we got to watch the fireworks while sipping margaritas and enjoying the cool A/C. Best day ever!

8/4: we hopped on the friendship boat to Hollywood studios and then took a bus to AKL to see some animals! The giraffes, antelopes, zebra, and flamingos were quite fun to behold. Toddler loved the Hakuna Matata playground, too. We then took the bus back to HS and took the Skyliner back to BC to switch things up (and give us a final ride on the Skyliner). Another afternoon siesta, followed by dinner at Ale & Compass (seafood pot pie is a must!), and a final visit to Stormalong Bay: this time, there was a double-rainbow in the sky! It felt like the perfect magical farewell from WDW.

8/5: saddest moment is always check-out time. We had a quick breakfast at the YC marketplace (I actually recommend this pretzel bun breakfast sandwich FAR above the bagel one at BC marketplace! Wish we had tried it sooner.) and then headed to MCO.

All in all, it was a great trip! Thanks everybody for the wonderful tips for staying cool in the August heat and humidity, especially: (1) taking breaks during the hottest part of the day (1-4pm), (2) bringing personal cooling fans for everybody, (3) staying EXTRA hydrated, and (4) popping into the shade/air-conditioned spaces whenever it feels like it's too much. World Showcase did feel extremely toasty at times, but the gift shops and other indoor spaces were plentiful along the way!

We'll be back in January to stay at the Boardwalk, and I can't wait!!!",10,1754584806.0,WaltDisneyWorld,0,0.92,False

‚Äç

**Why This Pick?**

Seattle has absolutely dominated this series, and today should be no exception. The Mariners have scored 8 runs in each game of this series so far, and at least 5 runs in 6 of their last 7 meetings with the White Sox. With the home advantage and their offense cooking the way that it is, I won‚Äôt be surprised if they cash today‚Äôs Over for both teams all by themselves. That said, Chicago will desperately be trying to avoid getting swept, and Seattle barely held onto the RL cover last night (steering clear of that today‚Ä¶). For these reasons, my money is on the Mariners to put at least 5 in the bag.

Unfortunately cameras do not capture the parking lot so I had no luck with getting any sort of footage. Today I came back to this location to work and noticed a red car, so I went and took a look at the front of the car and what do u know, white paint and scratches. I look into the store and see the owner of the car getting up, she walks past me and gets in the red car. I walk up to her car to confront her and she denies being here the day my car was hit and just drives off. My question is do I have enough proof that it may be her?

I recently started listening to creepcast on my drives to work and I got inspired. So I hope you all enjoy it and let me know what you thought of it*


I know many of you won't believe this, but I don't know what else to do at this point. I need help, the problem is I don‚Äôt know exactly what anyone can do. Let me just start‚Ä¶

It was a typical Thursday in the mid-July heat as I walked out to my shitbox I call a vehicle. The flyer was tucked beneath my windshield wiper blade, a glossy contrast to the grime that coated my windshield. ‚ÄúTiny living, Tiny home!‚Äù, it read in bold font with a picture underneath of the most adorable little home I‚Äôve ever seen. It was a true tiny home: about 10 feet wide, a small pitched roof, a little front porch, and even a little window flower box filled with tulips and daisies. Almost like it was straight out of a storybook about gnomes.

I almost tossed the flyer, but something about it just gripped me. Midwest suburbia isn't exactly the place that has a gem like this just sitting around. Maybe it was the novelty of it,  especially after my wife left. Leaving the big house empty and dull. The rooms now felt like empty caverns, a tiny home felt almost‚Ä¶ comforting. Not to mention a lot less to take care of, a perk in itself. 

The address was only a few blocks from my home, strangely enough I‚Äôve never heard of the street. Even more strange is, what would a tiny home be doing nestled in a suburban neighborhood? No mind, why not go check it out for myself anyways. What else did I have to do?

As I drove up the newly paved asphalt on the brand new cul-de-sac they were adding, there it was. A perfect little doll house, nestled between the lot of the typical cookie-cutter homes surrounding it. A sign staked in the neatly trimmed front yard read, ‚ÄúOpen House, Come Inside!‚Äù. Looking back I never paid attention to the fact that there was no realtor, with their typical smiling face with crossed arms plastered on the sign with it. I walk up to the house and step on the porch, hearing no sounds inside. I opened the door that was slightly short for me, making me chuckle from the ridiculousness of it all. I duck my head down a little and go to step inside. I wish I never did.

What I can only describe as the worst migraine in human existence hit me. It was like a swarm of wasps in my brain, desperately stinging to get out. I stumbled forward into the house and hit the floor with a hard thud. As the pain subsided, it left my head swimming. I looked up, no longer a home that was tiny. I thought I was hallucinating. The ceiling of the entry room soared over my head, at least twenty feet high. The entry room stretched out before me, the sunlight shining through the massive windows making the dark hardwood floor shine with an amber glow. I could damn near fit my entire house in this room. ‚ÄúThis is fucking impossible‚Äù, I muttered out, my words echoing as if I was on top of a mountain. 

My heart began to race, my earlier amusement quickly replaced by fear‚Ä¶ maybe even worse: doom. ‚ÄúHELLO‚Äù, I yelled out, the only response I received was my own echo. I got up and returned to the door. Its cutesy appearance now replaced with a massive ornate oak door, the handle far out of my reach. Even if I could reach it, the handle was massive and it had an intricate looking lock. I decided to try my luck elsewhere, turned around and start walking deeper inside the house.

The air felt different here, heavier and stagnant. The silence that cast in the house felt strange, almost as if the house itself was holding its breath. The entry room was sparsely furnished. All the pieces were oversized and antique. A fireplace with a massive leather armchair and coffee table to match sitting next to it appropriately. The pit was large enough to roast a whole cow in, assuming the cow was still my size in this place. This felt less like a home, more like a country club for giants. 

Driven by unease or need to find an escape, I began to explore the house. The hallways are long and seemingly endless, aligned with doorways on either side. Each doorway that I could peak into, the room was equally large and adorned with the same style furniture. A four-poster bed the size of a semi. The bathroom had a massive claw-foot tub. The dining room with a table that could sit twenty and the attached kitchen with an old wood style oven, yet to my dismay it was devoid of any food. Every room meticulously clean yet had absolutely no personal touch to speak of, it reminded me of an oversized bed and breakfast. 

I don‚Äôt know if it was the extreme silence that was finally getting to me, but I could swear I was hearing the walls whisper. Every step that made the wood creak would echo back as if the home was mocking me. The impending doom of my situation was begging to set in along with the panic, was I going to die here? My phone of course had no signal. The window sills, too high for me to even waste my energy to reach. As my desperation started to set in, I began to yell. Banging against the walls and screaming in a foolish attempt to get anyone, or anything, to respond. Once again, only the sound of my echo played back to me like a song stuck in your head. 

As darkness began to descend, the house took on a new, more sinister character. The shadows danced, turning familiar shapes into terrifying colossi. The air grew cold and I swear I could still hear my echoes whispering in the distance, although I may have just been going mad. Hunger gnawed at my stomach and thirst parched my throat. Sleep was impossible, everytime I would almost doze off it felt as though a million eyes were on me. My mind raced with the impossibleness of it all, and the fact that this place is sure to become my oversized tomb.

The morning didn't come soon enough, the massive rays of dawn filtering through the giant windows did little to lift my spirits. ‚ÄúFocus idiot‚Äù, I hoarsely said as I slowly stood up. My body was stiff and aching from the cold and lack of any discernable sleep. I decided to find a way out, anything that would give me hope for escape. I began systematically moving room to room, searching everything I could reach within reason. The walls were solid, the only doors were the obvious ones that only lead to more of the same. 

As the day wore on, I began to give up on any hope of finding escape. The feeling of being watched intensified, I felt as though I would catch glimpses of movement in my periphery only to turn and see the vast expanse of walls and windows. Then just as I went back to where I had started in the entryway, something caught my eye.

‚ÄúThe fireplace dumbass‚Äù, I said to myself, my echo repeating it back mockingly. I quickly moved over the fireplace and climbed up inside the pit and looked up the stack. It seemed as tall as Mount Everest, and might as well have been as weak as I was. ‚ÄúFUCK‚Äù, I screamed out, and for the first time I heard another sound other than just my echo. A light dusting of dirt hit the floor next to me. As I turned and looked, my eyes lit up as if I just had found the holy grail itself. There nestled between two cobblestone rocks, was a hole just big enough for me to crawl through. 

Without hesitation or any modicum of planning I dove in. I begin to crawl with renewed vigor. The earthy smell of damp soil was a stark contrast to the stale air of the house. Ironically in this moment it was a breath of fresh air, even though the hole was tight enough to give cave crawlers a panic attack. I clawed and scraped my way forward even when the feeling of claustrophobia threatened to overwhelm me as the tunnel seemed to go on forever. I don't exactly know how long I crawled, in the pitch black it's hard to put it together the concept of time. All I know is that I will never forget the feeling I had when I saw the smallest amount of light ahead. 

I emerged from the hole on the side of a grassy hillside. I stood blinking in the bright sunlight as my eyes adjusted, overlooking a vast and unfamiliar landscape. Rolling green hills stretched out before me, dotted with quaint villages that resembled nothing of midwest corn country although they were at least normal sized. Where the hell was I?

I pulled out my phone... roaming. ‚ÄúWell that is a step better than none‚Äù, I said to myself and for once I didn't hear that damn echo back. It gave me a weird sense of relief to not hear it. I walked, well stumbled, to a nearby road and made way to the nearest visual of civilization I could find. As I approached I read a sign that made my blood run cold ‚ÄòWelcome to Connemara, Ireland‚Äô. ‚ÄúFucking Ireland! HOW?!‚Äù, I commented as I turned around looking at where I came from. No house, tiny or otherwise. No hole that I just spent an eternity crawling through. Just the expanse of Ireland's rolling green countryside.

I still don‚Äôt understand what happened, I don't know if I ever will. I'm writing this in a small pub. I suppose the locals took pity on me, given the state I looked in, at least providing me with a bath, clean clothes, food and a beer. I don‚Äôt know how I am going to get home with no passport to my name but all I know figuring this out is far better than still be trapt‚Ä¶ there. So if you even slightly believe me, any help would be appreciated. I would rather not be homeless in Ireland and I am exhausted beyond words. Thanks.

1mk4y37,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mk4y37/explore_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_with/,Explore the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker with Hario V60 Set,"The Hario V60 Ceramic Pour Over Coffee Set, Size 02 in white, quickly earned its place as a staple in my daily coffee routine. As someone who appreciates brewing methods that prioritize control and flavor, this pour-over coffee maker has exceeded my expectations while presenting a couple of nuances worth discussing. 

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me about this coffee set was its sleek, minimalistic design. The ceramic dripper feels solid and has a clean white finish that looks fantastic on my kitchen counter. Coupled with the heatproof borosilicate glass server, it's evident that this product prioritizes durability without compromising elegance. The BPA-free handle and lid on the coffee server are a thoughtful touch, making it comfortable to handle even when filled with hot coffee. On top of being aesthetically pleasing, the materials used inspire confidence that this set was built to last. Using ceramic also means better heat retention and even coffee extraction, a key feature for delivering that perfect cup.

**Ease of Use and Brewing Experience**

Using this manual coffee maker has been an unexpectedly rewarding experience. The set includes everything needed to get started: a V60 coffee dripper, coffee server, scoop, and 100 disposable paper filters. Even as someone new to pour-over brewing, the process felt intuitive. The paper filters fit snugly into the cone-shaped dripper, and the coffee scoop provided an easy way to measure grounds, ensuring consistency with each brew. While the manual operation requires a bit more effort than automated coffee makers, I‚Äôve found the ritual to be soothing, almost meditative. Heating water and slowly pouring it over the grounds while controlling the flow rate has its own charm.

**Taste and Performance**

In terms of flavor, this pour-over set does not disappoint. The V60 size 02 is designed to make 1-4 cups of coffee, a perfect range for individual use or a small group. Because the dripper‚Äôs ceramic material evenly distributes heat, each pour-over results in a cup with enhanced clarity and bold flavors. The cone-shaped design and wide opening of the dripper offer excellent water flow, which is critical for precise extraction. It‚Äôs particularly great for medium to light roast coffee, where subtle flavor notes shine. However, mastering the perfect water temperature and pouring technique requires practice. My first few brews weren‚Äôt spectacular, but once I figured out the right technique, it became clear why this coffee maker has such a solid reputation.

**Perks**

- Sleek ceramic dripper design enhances heat retention for optimal extraction  
- Size 02 allows flexibility, making up to 4 cups in one brew  
- Complete starter kit includes dripper, server, scoop, and filters   
- Produces bold, aromatic coffee with incredible clarity  
- Easy-to-clean components for hassle-free maintenance  

[Check Hario V60 Ceramic Pour Over Coffee Set price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b01l6ocxas/)

**Areas for Improvement**

Despite its numerous strengths, there are a few quirks that might not be for everyone.  

- The manual brewing process demands time and patience, which might not suit busy mornings  
- Some users may find ceramic more fragile compared to stainless steel or plastic alternatives  
- Premium materials raise the price compared to budget-level pour-over setups  

**Market Rivals**

In the competitive world of pour-over coffee makers, this set holds its own against well-known names like the Chemex and Kalita Wave. While the Chemex offers a larger capacity and doubles as an elegant carafe, its glass build is more prone to breakage than Hario‚Äôs compact ceramic dripper. On the other hand, the Kalita Wave‚Äôs flat-bottom design simplifies brewing for newcomers but lacks the same level of manual control as the V60. If workflow flexibility and fine-tuned control are priorities, I‚Äôve found this set to be the most rewarding option among the three.

**True Value**

What makes this product worth every penny is the robust build quality, elegant design, and the superior coffee it helps produce. While the upfront investment might seem slightly higher compared to entry-level manual coffee makers, the included accessories and consistent performance justify the price point. If you want to level up your home brewing game, this set delivers a professional experience without the hefty price tag of high-end espresso machines or fully-automated brewers.

1mk4xr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGMaker/comments/1mk4xr7/whats_with_all_the_1_5_plugins_hot_take_warning/,What's with all the $1 - $5 plugins? Hot take warning...,"I wanted to make this post shorter but my *feelings* didn't let me. If you read the whole thing, I love you, we're basically best friends now. Even if you disagree with me!

So - plugins for MZ are suddenly *blowing up*. Well maybe not suddenly, but I feel like every other day, there's a new plugin post. I mean - that's great for the community! More support for everyone! But dang, they're all asking for cash??

I don't want to offend anyone, I know we all deserve to be compensated for our time and effort. People need to pay bills. I'm a grown adult with a ft job, I can pay for these, and I certainly have. I can't tell you how much money I've dropped on plugins LOL. I also hate using the word ""free"" because it's got a negative ""free handout"" connotation, maybe a better word is ""accessible."" I'm not looking for free handouts and I'm not implying *all* plugins need to be free.

But! I dunno...

I feel like the community is starting to throttle itself to death with all these paid plugins. No one wants to pay for a ton of plugins after already buying the engine. **These people aren't going to give RPG Maker a chance if they think there's all this extra stuff they need to buy.** I'm thinking of all the students who don't want to, or even can't, drop cash, to make a ""better"" RPG Maker game. There are kids who don't even have debit cards for paypal or itch yet. There are college students who'd rather buy instant ramen than a plugin. And so these people probably aren't going to be joining the community. Not when Godot exists, in particular, but that convo will make this post longer than it already is.

The $1 plugins irk me because like, it's $1, what are you going to do with that? You're getting cents after the cut. Why not make it available for the people who can't drop a buck? Wow, you made tree-fiddy this month, congratulations - I mean, you could have helped and/or inspired hundreds of people, brought some art out into the world that so desperately needs it - but that's cool, enjoy your coffee.

The $5 plugins irk me more because most of these are just *filler bloatware* plugins that can be done with variables and common events and I'm just wondering *why*.

Massive overhauls? Yes! Charge! There used to be whole engine-altering ""plugins"" (not called plugins at the time) that people happily paid for, pre-MV, pre-VX Ace days.

QoL improvement? Sure!

But shitty bloatware? Stop. Get over yourself. Newbies think they need these plugins without first trying to make it with events themselves. It feels like it's in bad faith, and that they're advantage of people.

The RPG Maker community has always been a ""niche"" community in that **it's mostly creatives and storytellers** who want to game dev without coding. These people like to play RPG Maker games specifically to see what people come up with when using such a limited-in-scope engine, among other reasons. Because of the limitations, there are developers who coded plugins that were mostly free, because these creators **too were part of the niche community**, and wanted to help bring RPG Maker games to another level.

Basically we were all rooting for each other, helping each other out with our own particular strengths (artists, coders, etc.), getting excited about each other's games, etc.

It doesn't feel like a helpful community anymore. It feels like a cash grab.

Remember Moghunter? AMAZING free plugins! Galv? Still around - and still free! SumRndmDde? Game changing stuff, 97 plugins just for MV! Viktor? Himeworks?

Remnants from the past. Excuse my rose-tinted glasses. I think I only bought 1 plugin in MV days and it was because it was a massive QoL improvement that was worth it to me, and that Yanfly didn't already cover.

I'm not mentioning Patreon because that was around during VxAce and MV too, though it was usually toted as ""support us to help keep our plugins free!"" Nowadays, most of the people who ""sell"" their plugins to Patrons only, have good deals going on. For the cost of a SINGLE Itch plugin ($5-$10), you can get ALL of their plugins, at least for that month. PhoenixKage comes to mind. And he still has free plugins, some with ""pro"" upgrades. This is fine to me. Aekashics has a great patreon, too, though not really my target here.

**For comparison of then and now:**

1 - Not calling anyone out - but (lol) there was a creator who posted their *really cool project* some time ago, lovely art, unique mechanics, people were impressed, asked how they did it, and the creator responded saying they don't code, they used ChatGPT. And that's totally fine with me, more power to you, glad you're making a cool game, can't wait to see more. But then a few months later, I see that same creator putting their plugins up for sale, and people are commenting, ""wow so talented!"" and it gave me the ick. Am I the only one who remembers this same person was using AI?

Yes I admit, if you're holding onto some cool plugins, it's awesome to share what you've made. But that's not what I'm feeling here.

For comparison, Akea was a creator who gave away their ""proprietary"" plugins too, including full battle revisions, but it was before all of this, and they are free. If those were posted today, guarantee the pack would cost $50.

And these were made with far more sweat and tears, before AI.

2 - There was a plugin posted the other day that **literally does the same exact same thing that is currently FREE(!!!) RPGMAKER DLC** but this one was in a plugin format, and it was $5. Oh but the free DLC was released 10 years ago (still works for MZ) and the plugin was released last week. I mentioned ""bad faith"" earlier but this one is more egregious.

Inflation?

Tariffs?

Nah. I blame AI's ""hustle culture."" Use AI *now* to make a buck *now* and *quickly.* (Edited note: I'm not claiming everyone is using AI. I'm saying it's the culture that has exploded after AI came out.)

And I also blame Yanfly/VS. When their plugins were free, all plugins were free. Now there's a \~ MaRkEt \~. And people are buying. I guess I shouldn't be mad. *Don't hate the player! Hate the game!*

I made 4-hour long parallax mapping tutorials back in the day on a brand new YouTube channel (not monetized!), not for myself, but for the community. I made an entire series recently about using RPG Maker WITH completely for free, on a still un-monetized youtube channel, that took me ages to record and edit. For the community!

And who even uses WITH?? That one guy! I see you. You're welcome. Make something awesome. My time and effort helped at least *someone* and I love that.

Now it's like, dang, maybe I should I be selling my videos for $5 each! Make an online course, sign up for $10/month! Ugh.

Anyway. I'm going to get yelled at for this, but I needed to get my feelings out in the open. I'm not going to argue with everyone\* in the comments, we all have our opinions, and I respect yours. Please don't ban me from the sub, I love this place lol.",19,1754584556.0,RPGMaker,28,0.75,False

1mk4wz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1mk4wz3/explore_if_the_best_laundry_whitener_oxiclean/,Explore if the Best Laundry Whitener OxiClean Actually Works,"Testing out the OxiClean B00IA9QS9K laundry whitener has been quite an experience, not only because it promises 40 percent better whitening than chlorine bleach but also because it claims to be chlorine-free and odorless. As someone who has gone through countless laundry whitening products and still ended up with vaguely gray socks and lifeless t-shirts, I was skeptical. That all changed when I started using this powder. I can‚Äôt lie‚Äîmy whites have never looked brighter, and the process is surprisingly hassle-free. Whether it‚Äôs between loads of laundry at home or helping my kids brighten their school uniforms stained with who-knows-what, this product has been my go-to laundry sidekick.

**Ease of Use and Application**  
Using this oxygen-based laundry booster is much easier than wrestling with traditional bleach. Imagine not having to worry about splashes or accidental bleach disasters. The powder‚Äôs instructions are clear‚ÄîI mix it with water to pre-soak items or just toss it into the drum with my regular detergent. My HE washing machine seemed to welcome it with open arms, as there was no clumping or residue left behind. Plus, the versatility to handle anything from linen sheets to canvas shoes makes it a true multitasker.

[See OxiClean B00IA9QS9K deals on Amazon now.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b00qkihxce/)

**Performance is Everything**  
One of the reasons I‚Äôm impressed with this product is its sheer effectiveness. It doesn‚Äôt just make promises; it actually delivers. Dingy whites become noticeably brighter‚Äîeven socks that have been through years of walking on wooden floors seem to bounce back to life. I tested it on stubborn coffee stains and kid-sized grass stains, and they were handled with ease. Unlike products that struggle with harder stains, this removes them consistently with almost no extra steps. I‚Äôve also noticed zero fabric damage, which is always a win in my laundry book.

**Winning Points**  
- Oxygen-based whitening formula is highly effective.
- Does not carry that overpowering chlorine smell.
- Safe for both whites and light-colored clothing.
- Versatile for machine-washable shoes, bedding, t-shirts, and more.

**Drawbacks**  
Despite its effectiveness, perfection isn‚Äôt always guaranteed.  
- Pre-soaking can be time-consuming for tougher stains.  
- It doesn‚Äôt work miracles on all fabrics‚Äîdelicate items like lace or silk may require extra care.  
- Might not be budget-friendly for extensive family use, as the three-pound container disappears quicker with frequent loads.

**Rival Brands**  
In terms of competition, we‚Äôve got the likes of Clorox bleach or Tide stain removers. While bleach is the typical go-to for whitening, OxiClean differentiates itself by being safer for both whites and colors, unlike bleach which can turn unintended items a shocking splotched shade. On the other hand, Tide‚Äôs stain-removal pods don‚Äôt cover the whitening brilliance that OxiClean delivers. Each product has unique strengths, but if you‚Äôre seeking an easy, less chemically aggressive option, OxiClean carves out its spot effectively. It offers high efficiency when balancing whitening and care for your fabrics.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Cost-wise, it‚Äôs essential to weigh the purpose. If you‚Äôre keeping your whites brilliantly bright and reviving forgotten pieces of laundry, the investment speaks for itself. Its multi-functionality justifies the purchase because you‚Äôre saving trips to the dry cleaner and reducing the time spent scrubbing stains manually. Admittedly, it isn‚Äôt the cheapest option available, but the results are tangible, and I‚Äôve yet to regret a single load‚Äôs outcome.

I don't know if close was bad the night before or no one's been checking but I found several truly filthy cups, lipstick, matcha, coffee rings the works. I started stacking them off to the side to be taken to the back to be scrubbed down properly,   and told my SSV/CS that dirty cups were there and we agreed at some point one of us would get to it. 


 A few minutes later a customer asked to have their drink in a mug and I went to the bar to look for a clean one while my manager grabbed a filthy one I had set to the side and started making a coffee in it. There was an obvious lipstick mark on and when she tried to serve it to the customer he said he wanted a clean cup, she then tried to get on my ass about it but I told her that it was a pile of obviously dirty cups (the iced venti cup had matcha all over it). She tried to have a connect about me serving customers dirty cups but my supervisor shut it down.

I didn‚Äôt ask her to pay me back for her $8 coffee.,"I caught up with an old girlfriend recently. We‚Äôre both 30. We went to lunch and split the bill in half ($40 per person, she ordered the appetizers and I couldn‚Äôt eat them because I have a dairy allergy - I didn‚Äôt mind and she also took them home). After lunch she wanted to get a massage at the mall. Not a chair massage, but one with an actual person in one of those open walk-up spots. I said sure. It was $25 for 20 minutes. She ended hers a little early and by the time I was done, she had already paid for both of us and tipped around $20 total.

Afterward we went to Starbucks and I offered to pay for her drink ($9 per person). 

Before we said goodbye I gave her a small birthday present I had brought with me. It wasn‚Äôt a huge deal, maybe $60 total.

We had large layoffs a few months ago as well which definitely caused morale to go down. 

I received an offer from what has historically been a dream company of mine, highly established large tech company with a great office in nyc. That said, the offer will be 20k lower in base salary (but offers equity) at a junior IC level, and this is the very top of their band that I already negotiated to. They have way more benefits (free coffee, breakfast & lunch, hybrid schedule, 401k match, bonus, wellness stipend, etc).

The lower base and level downgrade stings, but I think looking at the offer more holistically and the room for growth makes it more appealing. Additionally, I love my current manager and would say that would be the toughest thing to leave along with some great colleagues.

1mk4ryg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mk4ryg/should_you_buy_the_chulux_slim_single_serve/,Should You Buy the CHULUX Slim Single Serve Coffee Maker Review for Travelers?,"The CHULUX CL-CM24002 Slim Single Serve Coffee Maker has been part of my daily coffee routine for a little while now, and I have thoughts, let me tell you. This compact coffee machine aims to simplify the process of brewing a quick cup of coffee, and it‚Äôs packed with features that appeal to anyone who loves efficiency and convenience. I'd say it lives up to the promise in many ways, though there are a few caveats to consider.

**Compact Elegance for Tight Spaces**  
I didn‚Äôt realize how important a slim design was until I tried this coffee maker. It takes up just 4 inches of counter space, which is a lifesaver in my notoriously tiny kitchen. Its sleek and modern black exterior adds a touch of style without being overpowering. This compact design isn‚Äôt just an advantage for kitchens, though; I can easily see this fitting in RVs, dorm rooms, or offices, and it‚Äôs portable enough to take along for camping trips or vacations.

**Ease of Use and Brewing Options**  
What originally drew me to this single-serve coffee machine was its simple, no-nonsense design. I appreciate that it‚Äôs compatible with both K-cups and ground coffee, giving me the flexibility to switch between my favorite pods and my own brews. The one-touch operation is genuinely dummy-proof; you fill the water reservoir and press a single button to get started. Choosing a brewing size‚Äîbetween 6 and 12 ounces‚Äîis effortless, making this the perfect coffee maker for variable caffeine needs throughout the day.  

**[Check CHULUX CL-CM24002 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cvxq9bck/)**  

**Powerful and Efficient Performance**  
This machine heats water to an impressive 190¬∞F in under two minutes, so morning grogginess doesn‚Äôt linger long in my household. I love that it automatically shuts off after brewing your coffee, saving energy and sparing me the anxiety of wondering if I turned it off before leaving the house. Plus, the unique 4-hole needle ensures great coffee extraction with a richer flavor than I expected from such a small machine. It‚Äôs one of those details that seems small until you taste the difference. 

**Perks**  
- Compact and slim, which is perfect for small spaces.  
- Compatible with K-cups, coffee pods, and ground coffee using a reusable filter.  
- Automatic shutoff functions add convenience and energy savings.  

**Brewing in Comfort‚Äîor Not**  
I wish I had paid more attention to the note about altitude restrictions. Living just shy of 4,000 feet, I noticed steep performance drops during my recent road trip to mountainous regions. This issue might not affect most users, but for those at higher elevations, bear it in mind. Cleaning and descaling also require regular attention, as mineral buildup could otherwise clog the system. It suggests cleaning every 1-2 months, but lighter cleaning wasn‚Äôt enough to handle my hard water issues perfectly.

**Drawbacks**  
- Struggles with performance above 4,000 feet.  
- Requires regular descaling to maintain flow and quality.  

**Alternative Options**  
Comparing this little machine to competitors like the Keurig K-Mini or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single Serve, I found the CHULUX Coffee Maker to be highly competitive on size. The Keurig machine offers a similarly compact design but struggles with brew consistency when it comes to ground coffee, something I valued with this coffee maker. The FlexBrew also supports ground coffee and K-cups, but it‚Äôs bulkier and lacks the ultra-compact form factor that makes this one a better choice for limited spaces. Keurig‚Äôs slight edge is the more extensive user support system, but let‚Äôs be honest‚ÄîI rarely use that anyway. 

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its price, this single-serve coffee maker offers excellent value. You get a versatile brewing experience in a package ideal for small or multi-use spaces. While it might not be as robust as more expensive models, it performs exceptionally well for its compact and lightweight design. For those wanting a straightforward, space-efficient coffee machine, this one strikes a satisfying balance between affordability and quality.
