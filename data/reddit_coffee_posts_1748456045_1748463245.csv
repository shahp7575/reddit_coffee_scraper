Hear me out. Whenever I jot down something I'm grateful for, I try to find a way to connect it to a conversation with someone new. Like, the other day I was grateful for a surprisingly good latte, so I just casually mentioned it to the person next to me at the cafe. Turns out, they were a total coffee enthusiast, and we ended up chatting about our favorite coffee spots for ages! It's honestly such an easy way to break the ice and discover shared interests. Plus, it makes your gratitude list a little more dynamic, ya know? Might be worth a try if you're looking to make some new friends! 😊",1,1748462899.0,mindHacksToday,0,1.0,False

I am a 24f barista, I have a bit of an alternative look, many piercings, many tattoos and currently I have bright purple hair.

This older woman came in before work and thought it was ok to immediately start talking about how my appearance was ""unprofessional"" and that I looked ""like a delinquent."" She was adamant about speaking to my manager because the style of people serving customers is generally ""normal"" not some young punk. Something like that! I've been on the receiving end of comments like that before, usually I just smile it off and carry on.

Then, what does she do? Start get really loud, calling me a delinquent and she's saying that I'm probably doing drugs and shouldn't be working around food. Other customers were looking around, some seemed uncomfortable, but I was trying not to involve anyone else.
My co-worker even tried helping me because she couldn't believe what the woman was saying, but she was relentless!

Finally I said ""Ma'am, regardless of my appearance, it isn't a reflection of my ability to make your coffee. If you wish to continue to be discriminating, I will ask you to leave.""

She stormed out of the shop bad mouthing me and saying she would be leaving a few bad reviews. My manager wasn't impressed with my response even though he easily agreed the lady was wrong.

At my doctor's recommendaiton, we've started to lower the dosage. Last night I took 200mg for the first time. 

Today, I'm feeling fine. A little tired, but the most worrying thing is the changes in scents and tastes. EVERYTHING smells and tastes bad. The laundry smelled like gasoline, my milk smelled fruity, my coffee tasted fruity, the seasoning packet for my ramen smelled moldy, and the ramen itself smelled like cat piss. I also got super sick (room spinning, vertigo, extremely nauseous and having to choke down food) while trying to eat said lunch. The food tasted fine, better than usual actually. All of the scents have been pretty subtle and I can smell the real scent if I bring the source of the scent up close to my nose! 

When I had BPPV eating would trigger vertigo and nausea and my lunch episode kinda felt like that, but the changes and scents tell me it's probably not my BPPV coming back. I've been a bit nauseous since waking up, actually.

Has anyone else had experiences like this?, particularly from lowering doses? Is this considered ""withdrawal"" ? If you've experienced this, how long did it take for you to go back to normal and how did you manage in the meantime?

Long story short - my ex broke up with me 3 weeks ago out of the blue. We had been together for almost a decade. It was perfect (seemingly), I was and still am so in love. He even asked my best friend to get my ring size so he could propose. But instead broke up with me out of nowhere because he said he wasn’t IN love with me anymore. I just moved out yesterday after being there for 3 weeks and now I’m unfortunately staying with my family for a beat. 

The first two days of the breakup were as you’d expect. We cried a lot together, shared appreciation for each other and what we have/had. Talked about couples therapy instead. But then practically overnight it’s like I no longer existed. He couldn’t look at me, talk to me, touch me, care for me like we had been in a relationship for 9.5 years. I wasn’t asking him to act like my Bf, but I didn’t want to think he hated me or was repulsed by me. I couldn’t get anything out of him for weeks. He asked me to stay. He asked me stay longer. And then I feel like I was punished for staying. It felt too long but not long enough. 

Then our last full day together he softened up. We spent a really nice day. Then in the evening I had written a long letter and he cried so hard. And told me how much he meant to me, and this really was a perfect relationship and he wishes this wasn’t happening. 

The next morning (day of the goodbye) we had coffee together, showered, and spent about an hour crying and holding each other before he walked out the door for work. Before he left he told me I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to him. After that my family came to help me move out. 

He text me all day checking in, but it was short and light. Then in the evening when he got home to a half empty apartment he was telling me he was hysterical. And nothing is the same. And he misses me. 

Now, today… he’s talking to me like we are just… casual friends. He’s initiating conversation. But it’s such a 180 from the day before. 

7 years prior he had “broken up” with me for similar reasons. But stayed close. And when we finally got back together over a year later he said it’s like we never broke up. But this 180 of feelings wasn’t happening that time.

I've seen how you guys could help others and wanted to see if you could help me, too.

I'm from Germany (Stuttgart), almost 30, and have

* studied business informatics (and parellely worked as a SAP consultant),
* worked as a bartender after (because I was sick of optimizing abstract processes),
* shortly (9 months) worked as a recruitment consultant in London,
* become self-employed and worked as a freelance ghostwriter ever since 2020.

I've always felt too social to work in IT and too honest to work in sales. In fact, I hate sales.

2023, my business took a huge hit, and I never fully recovered from it. I've lived mainly off old clients and savings (sold some crypto, too) up to now. In 2023, I tried getting an IT/Scrum position in Munich but had no luck. Now, I've been applying to IT, project, consultant, and many other jobs without luck, and have reached a point where I'd like to have some type of job that wouldn't require me to write stupid content for companies or even work in front of a PC all day. 

I'm tired of selling something (including my own services), being self-employed, and interested in bikes, travel, bread, sustainability, coffee, (even got a rejection for a barista position). I don't really know what to do. Today, I got another rejection for an assistant position at my old uni, after interviewing there last week. 

Maybe you can help me with some suggestions.

But it's actually the opposite of Will Smith's movie.

The Pursuit of Happyness at its core - a motivational success story based on real events. Notice to Quit is a story of constant failure. Someone would call it drama, but it's actually not depressing. Andy is a shitty realtor, a guy who previously failed at acting, didn't pay his rent for 4 months, and at the same day he's getting evicted, his estranged 10-year-old daughter comes and says it's her last day in NYC, and tomorrow she is with her mother moving to Florida, and she wanted to go to a Zoo. Her mother also has full custody and a new boyfriend.

Looking at how hard Andy tries to keep it all together, and considering it's a debut feature from an unknown director, you'd expect that by the end of the story, Andy would somehow find the money to pay the rent, spend some quality time with his daughter at the zoo, and also to somehow get his wife back. In fact, it goes directly the opposite.

Andy doesn't find new clients. Andy doesn't find any money to pay the rent. Andy breaks his phone. He gets separated from his daughter and loses the clients that were his last chance. At last, he decides to get her daughter to the zoo and runs those 30 blocks to her. He pretends that he sneaks her out of her mom and new guy, and they run to the zoo. But due to other events in the movie the zoo closes an hour earlier, and they don't get in. Despite that, both of them are walking in a park eating ice cream, and talking about how they'll be visiting each other and keeping in touch. Then they drive to Andy's apartment, and it turns out that Andy was in fact evicted, all his stuff is on the street. That same moment his ex-wife and new guy also came there because it turns out he actually warned them earlier. Andy says that he'll be all right, and he doesn't actually need all this stuff. They're saying goodbye.

Then Andy takes the only thing that is worth anything there - an air conditioning unit. For the whole night, he goes on foot to his father's apartment, which his father shares with a roommate Marvin. They're trying to set up the air conditioner DIY there, and while they're getting distracted drinking coffee, Marvin says ""This is gonna be a good day"". And the AC falls out of the window. The end.

The guy is a complete loser, and he's been losing the whole day. But despite that, he's...at peace with that? He gets the most important thing done - spending good time with his daughter. All the rest, all the stuff, rent, jobs, money, his eviction - it doesn't matter, ""he doesn't need any of this"". He'll be okay.

Compare it to something like the iconic Falling Down, and ask, would any shit Michael Douglas's character experienced actually matter if his relationship with his wife and daughter would be at least a little better?

While Andy is going to his father with an AC through beautiful night NYC, the great song is [playing](https://youtu.be/aHZsNj4v4ms?si=yQVPRfskX_KnOM_W), Strange Behavior by Bleachers. And it's lyrics explains everything:

>Look at this, this is just a shadow

>What you thought was faith, that was hollow

>Look at you, you've been chasing shadows

>That's why you wake up in two

She told me he left when she was 10. That she hadn’t seen him since. That sometimes she watches me drink my coffee and wonders what it would’ve been like if he’d stayed.

I didn’t know what to say. I still don’t. I just told her, “He missed out. You seem like a damn good kid.”

Andy doesn't find new clients. Andy doesn't find any money to pay the rent. Andy breaks his phone. He gets separated from his daughter and loses the clients that were his last chance. At last, he decides to get her daughter to the zoo and runs those 30 blocks to her. He pretends that he sneaks her out of her mom and new guy, and they run to the zoo. But due to other events in the movie the zoo closes an hour earlier, and they don't get in. Despite that, both of them are walking in a park eating ice cream, and talking about how they'll be visiting each other and keeping in touch. Then they drive to Andy's apartment, and it turns out that Andy was in fact evicted, all his stuff is on the street. That same moment his ex-wife and new guy also came there because it turns out he actually warned them earlier. Andy says that he'll be all right, and he doesn't actually need all this stuff. They're saying goodbye.

Then Andy takes the only thing that is worth anything there - an air conditioning unit. For the whole night, he goes on foot to his father's apartment, which his father shares with a roommate Marvin. They're trying to set up the air conditioner DIY there, and while they're getting distracted drinking coffee, Marvin says ""This is gonna be a good day"". And the AC falls out of the window. The end.

The guy is a complete loser, and he's been losing the whole day. But despite that, he's...at peace with that? He gets the most important thing done - spending good time with his daughter. All the rest, all the stuff, rent, jobs, money, his eviction - it doesn't matter, ""he doesn't need any of this"". He'll be okay.

Compare it to something like the iconic Falling Down, and ask, would any shit Michael Douglas's character experienced actually matter if his relationship with his wife and daughter would be at least a little better?

While Andy is going to his father with an AC through beautiful night NYC, the great song is [playing](https://youtu.be/aHZsNj4v4ms?si=yQVPRfskX_KnOM_W), Strange Behavior by Bleachers. And it's lyrics explains everything:

>Look at this, this is just a shadow

>What you thought was faith, that was hollow

>Look at you, you've been chasing shadows

>That's why you wake up in two

What happened?","I work in a somewhat older and kind of janky office building on the second floor. In the middle of the day the hallway I was on felt like it was shaking from down below and there was a sound like when there's a lot of water draining out of a pipe for a washing machine in the shower or something but louder. 

Nobody could figure out what it was and it stopped after maybe 20 to 40 seconds. Probably 30 minutes to an hour later, I went to the bathroom and the water in the toilet was very dark brown like it was nasty and somebody had forgotten to flush, but one flushing it the water running back into the bowl was also brownish, with maybe a little bit of a red tinge. After running the water for a while, the sinks had this as well but it seemed to be lightning up. 

One of my co-workers said it may have been related to something in the fire suppression system and they were just going to run the water until it cleared up and we should be good, but I use that water to make my coffee everyday and our clients take medications mixed with it and I'm a little concerned about safety.

A few days ago, I was at a coffee shop, quietly working on my laptop and brainstorming ideas for a new business venture. It’s something I’ve been passionate about for years, and I finally saved enough to get started. As I was deep in thought, a visibly distressed person in their mid-20s approached me.

They explained they were new to the city, had lost their wallet, and were stranded with no way to get home. They showed me a few documents and seemed genuinely honest. Their situation hit me hard because I’ve been a stranger in a new city too. I know how isolating it can feel when you don’t know anyone and can’t ask for help.

Without thinking too much, I decided to help them. I gave them $50 for transportation and a meal, exchanged numbers, and wished them well. The thing is, I’m not in the best financial position myself. That $50 was part of my limited budget for launching my business, but I couldn’t ignore their need.

Now, days later, I haven’t heard back from them, and I’m starting to wonder if I made the right choice. Did I act too impulsively? Should I have prioritized my own needs?

Part of me feels like even if it was a scam, it’s a small price to pay for giving someone the benefit of the doubt. But another part of me is worried I may have jeopardized my own plans for no reason.

When you intend to foresee an event, you will know the probability of that event occurring, as well as the most likely permutations of the event. What makes events more unlikely to happen is whether decisions need to be made by other people to alter the event, and the chaos of physics. If something is guaranteed to happen due to cause and effect, the chances are 100%.

Chances you'll be hit by a car tomorrow? Almost zero. Most likely by a BMW driver.

Chances you'll stub your toe in an hour? For some reason the probability is higher than normal, in fact, it's rising. You go to sit down, hoping to avoid stubbing it, then boom, you catch it on the coffee table leg.

You want to exploit the casino? All the electronic machines have the same probability as normal. In fact, you find they're rigged in some places. Card games are more deterministic, since it's a 100% chance they'll draw a specific card, since, you know, it's already shuffled. You could probably game those until you're kicked out. Roullete would be fun, you'd have a solid edge while still losing occasionally.

Lottery tickets? For pre-determined winners, it's a toss up between a sea of 0% tickets, and a rare 100% ticket. For ones where you fill in the bubbles, it's even worse odds than roullete. Good luck with that.

TL;DR

I’m F34 married to my husband M51 for more than a year now. It’s been couple of days since I confronted him of his “cheating” when I did the forbidden thing any spouse would do (going thru his phone). 

Context: I only checked his phone I had a gut-feel that he’s doing something behind my back. Which I was right. Messaging girls on TikTok asking where they’re from, asking for coffee meet-ups, etc. Besides that, he’s been confiding with his ex-business partner about me and our marriage, where he’s so in love with her but she’s married and she doesn’t have feelings for him. 

Anyway, all of those things didn’t even shocked me. At first, I felt numbed. Maybe bec he already traumatized me before getting married when he got caught cheating with a bar girl and photos and videos were sent to me (that’s a whole different long story). But when I went scrolling some more, it suddenly dawned on me that cheaters will always be cheaters. And I know for a fact, he will gaslight me when I confront him. 

So I held on to these discoveries for a couple of days and I was miserable. I ignored him, not sleeping with him or kissing him, nothing. He noticed it but didn’t really do much. But when I commented on something about work, he knew he was in troubled waters with me. 

Skipping to the physical encounter, I was so triggered and worked up when he said he lost his “other phone” (which I was the one paying for it btw cos it’s my wedding gift). That’s when I started shouting at him (again 🙄) and called him stupid and idiot. We were talking to the car share driver who drove him home asking for help but that’s when I also shouted at him. He got so mad he hit me behind my head! First time to physically hurt me. 

I told him, I’m done with him and this toxic marriage. I want him out of the house and idc where he lives as long as he’s no longer welcome. Now I’m being gaslighted (like what I’ve foreseen) and being “threatened” with words… I’m not scared. I maybe a Bitch if a wife but it was all for him, for our life. So being an Alpha Female and a Virgo at the same time, is not my fault. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I just want to know, where do I go from here? 😞🫠",1,1748461713.0,Advice,5,0.67,False

Angles I’m considering:

Avr with hdmi arc and a tuner (Yamaha tsh5810)+ passive speakers (q150, wharfedale 12.0, or similar)+ turntable

Wiim ultra + unknown amp + similar speakers above + turntable + used tuner

Wiim ultra + powered speakers (kanto tuk on local Craigslist or something similar) + turntable + used tuner

I’d like to keep the budget close to $1000 and space is a large consideration so a sub is an unlikely addition. The room is fairly small so I don’t need massive sound, but also want it to sound as full as the budget would allow.

1kxqgsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1kxqgsn/help_im_being_harassed_by_my_neighbor_and/,"Help, I’m being harassed by my neighbor, and subsequently my landlord","Location: Monterey Park, CA

I’m being harassed by my neighbor, and subsequently my landlord. 

This all started back in February (only lived at this apartment since June ‘24) when my husband and I filled some holes with dirt and covered them with grass seed in the common area of our quadplex apartment. We did this so our toddler, who was learning to walk, wouldn’t trip in them. After the holes were filled, her and her two teenage boys called them “weird” several times in the common area where I could hear them from my porch. So, I finally said something from my porch to her on her steps (where she could clearly hear). “Hey, it’s just a little landscaping, I thought everyone would enjoy the holes being gone.” She ignores me and continues into her apartment. The next time I see her from my porch, she yells “WEIRD!” right before she goes inside and slams her door. 

A few weeks go by, and we get a complaint from our landlord from said neighbor. Everyone in the quadplex was putting their cans in front of her garage slots per the landlord. She doesn’t use the garage slots. She has one car, and always parks it on the street by our front door. So week one, she complains and we take them in. Week two, she complains again - the garbage truck put them in front of her slots and she comes by to harass our friend/house sitter (I am out of town on business). Week three, she complains specifically about our cans, but my husband specifically didn’t put them out that week. At this point, our landlord lets us know she’s a “mean lady”, “abrasive”, and ran off a tenant living below her. She then begins to clean all the junk out of her garage slots (important later).

April comes around, and our “abrasive” neighbor takes to playing music at 65-70 decibels (10-15 over Monterey Park’s city daytime decibel limit) and singing loudly along with it. It wakes up my toddler from her nap, so I let the landlord know via video. He says there’s nothing he can do about it. It happens again, and I let it slide because it doesn’t wake up my kid. Third time it happens my kid is down for a nap again and my husband is trying to work from home on the porch. During her first song (an explicit song, “Guess Who’s Back” by Eminem), she comes out to her porch to water her plants. When she’s finished and turns back to walk to her front door (i.e. facing our porch), I call up and say, “Hey, my kiddo is asleep, do you mind turning your music down?” She ignores me and slams her front door. At this, as I don’t want to deal with her attitude and I don’t know how she’ll react to me… I call the cops. They show up, and she loses control. Calling the sheriff’s department to complain about them in front of them, following them back to their patrol car, asking them if they need to see her Social Security card, and blatantly lying about me to them in front of me (said I smoke cannabis around my toddler). She also admitted to the cops that she heard me, ignored me because it wasn’t “decent” (we live super close… it’s Cali. Maybe 40-50 ft?) But the biggest snafu of hers in this situation was that she started openly filming us on our fenced patio (she lives upstairs), which is illegal in California without my consent. I let the landlord know. He informs us she is annoyed by my husband’s persistent cough that he’s had since a child (also yes sometimes we cough when we smoke cannabis on the porch) and a tapping sound made when we knocked out the glass bowl on to a resin ashtray.

A few days later she started filming us on our porch again, so I took a picture of her recording us and sent it to my landlord, asking for help. He tells us to “get a pillow or go somewhere like the park” to cough. We had also mentioned that she gets upset at the bubbles from our small toy bubble machine we use in our enclosed porch for the enjoyment of our toddler. Our landlord also said we “should” call the cops if she filmed us again, and that it was “creepy”. 

So of course, next thing we know our landlord is sending us a video she’s taken in the dark of us coughing. No, you can’t see our faces, but we are clearly the subject of this recording. I then call non-emergency again to ask what they can do about the filming/recording of us, and they send out two officers. As I did not want to escalate this situation, I stayed in my home while they spoke with her and did not record from the common area. When the cops were finished speaking with her, they came back to my front door and spoke with me. They said that she told them I deliberately blow smoke on her teenage sons. That is a lie.

She then goes to the City and has an inspector come out to cite code violations. She does this at this particular time to seek revenge on us. I think because she was previously cleaning out her garage slots that she had already planned to do this, but to me the timing is suspect, especially when our landlord told use she was going to the City after talking with him about the coughs. 

Our landlord then begins to try and police what we do on our rental property, saying we cannot smoke out there. It’s never been a problem before, because her downstairs neighbor smokes weed, and he’s lived there years before us. Neither has the noise of a cough, because Unit D informed us that the older gentlemen who lived here before us would wake up and cough, smoke cigarettes, and play loud music on the porch frequently. 

Also, the day he forbade us from smoking, he sent us screenshots from the nuisance neighbor that she was in the hospital - she has an auto- immune disorder, and the stress of our harassment i.e. us existing on our porch caused her to go to the emergency room. 
The morning after our landlord forbade us and only us from smoking cannabis on our porch and we received the hospital texts, we got two texts from him at 2AM. These texts were screenshots of the neighbor’s text to him about a “glass-on-glass tapping noise” that woke her up. When we woke up, we informed him that we were asleep - that it wasn’t us. 

This morning, I was sitting quietly on my porch drinking coffee, and a repairman came by. He needed into the laundry room, which was locked with a code. I didn’t have the code, but right as I’m saying that and texting our other neighbor for the code, out comes my nuisance of a neighbor. She came out and yelled out a code, which I guess didn’t work so she came down her stairs into the common area to let him in. She started complaining to the repairman about our code violations specifically - charging the car and the bulk trash behind the trash cans - and how someone leaves their detergent down there so the laundry room is “messy”. While she’s lamenting, I’m walking out into the common area to begin recording her. She continues her lament, and at the end of the video, she has the gall to suggest AGAIN that I smoke cannabis around my toddler. 

I also talked with another neighbor yesterday, and he told us that about four years ago her kids almost burnt the complex down. And confirmed that she ran off his roommate due to excessive noise, day and night.

We have almost all of this documented thru texts with our landlord, two police reports, and a video of her slandering me from the common area this morning. What can I do to make all this stop? We don’t want to move because the spot and location is great for us and especially the kiddo. ",3,1748461386.0,legal,1,1.0,False

1kxqemg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1kxqemg/the_strange_disappearance_of_jón_jónsson/,The strange disappearance of Jón Jónsson,"Jón Jónsson was a 41 year old Icelandic man who vanished under strange circumstances in Dublin on February 9th 2019. Despite extensive searches and appeals, no trace of him has ever been found.

Jón flew to Ireland by himself on February 8th with the intention of playing in a poker tournament over the weekend and then spending the rest of the time there with his fiancé as a holiday. Jón arrived into Dublin by himself and checked into the Bonnington hotel in the north of the city, the same venue that was hosting the tournament. He played throughout the night and everything seemed well. According to an eyewitness who was at the tournament, he seemed to be happy and in good form but they did state that he lost €4000 that night. He was also described as drinking a huge amount, enough that people were surprised that he could still stand. The following morning, Jón's fiancé arrived in Dublin, a woman by the name of Jana Gudjonsdottir. She arrived at the hotel around 10am and found Jón asleep in their hotel room. They had a brief conversation and then Jana decided to go downstairs to get some coffee. In the short period of time that she was gone, Jón very suddenly and unexpectedly left the hotel at 11:05am. It has never been determined why he decided to leave but he left behind his phone, wallet and passport, taking only his hotel key card. His family stated that they believed he had a large sum of money on him when he left the hotel but this has never been confirmed and it's uncertain why they held this belief.

At 11:07am, Jón was captured on CCTV walking past a pub and a nursing home before exiting onto Swords Road, heading towards Collins Avenue. He was last captured on CCTV walking past Highfield health centre. After this, Jón was never seen again. After he didn't return to the hotel all day, his fiancé started to grow concerned. When he hadn't returned by the following morning, Jana reported him missing to the Garda. Members of Jón's family flew over to Dublin immediately and a large scale search was launched with his family, Gardaí and civil defence all looking but no trace of him was found. In the CCTV footage of Jón before he vanished, he appeared relaxed and leisurely, smoking a cigarette and sauntering along. He wasn't followed and wasn't with anyone else. Jón's family are adamant he didn't disappear deliberately as he had just renewed his taxi licence back in Iceland and had upcoming family arrangements that he was excited for. One of his brothers had also described him as ""a nice, caring, reliable and stable guy"" and stated that he was always open about his finances and that if he needed financial help, he would have just asked his family. 

In 2020, a criminal who was incarcerated in an Icelandic prison contacted Jón's family and told them something interesting. He claimed that the €4000 that Jón lost on his first night belonged to an Icelandic criminal who was in Dublin at the time. Jón had allegedly gone to meet him to acquire more funds but things turned violent when the man got angry over his money being lost and accidentally killed Jón. His body was then allegedly buried in a nearby park. On an undisclosed date after his disappearance, both Garda and a local priest received letters that stated that he was killed after losing money and that his remains could be found buried in a park in Dublin. In 2024, an extensive search of Santry Park was conducted by Garda with the assistance of cadaver dogs but absolutely nothing was discovered. The search was subsequently called off. To date, no trace of Jón has been discovered and Garda now strongly suspect that he met foul play. However, with absolutely no sign of him or any solid information on what happened that day, this baffling case remains unsolved.

In March 2025, over 6 years since Jón vanished, it was announced that the Garda were enlisting the assistance of Europol to help them with the investigation. This development would seem to suggest that the Garda now suspect a criminal element to the case, with it being noted that they were following up on lots of new tips, including suggestions that Jón may have been killed by a hitman in a case of mistaken identity.

It’s no secret since Covid 86th street just hasn’t been the same. With so many empty storefronts for years now it has me frustrated every time I see it.

It feels like such a missed opportunity, especially with all the families, commuters, and long-time locals who live nearby. I personally really miss century 21, TJMAX, model’s, and all the small clothing stores. 

Curious, what businesses do you think would thrive here? Whether it’s a Trader Joe’s, a coffee shop that isn’t a Dunkin, better quality gyms, or something totally different — what would you actually go out of your way to support?

Also, if anyone knows how we can make a stronger case to bring good businesses here (petitions? talking to the BID? DMing companies?), would love to brainstorm together. This area deserves better than just empty signs.

I’ve been feeling down about my prediabetic condition. I’m open to pep talks and gentle mindset reminders as well as any technical tips.

How I found out I was prediabetic: 

While on vacation two years ago, I YOLOd and ate horribly during vacation. I felt so tired and sick during that vacation that I requested a blood panel when I got back. I had 20 little canker sores, small fever and was sluggish for my trip. A1c was 5.7.

I don’t even know how long I’ve been having elevated A1c’s. I only recently started getting yearly blood panels as I am nearing 40.

Age: 39

5’4” 138 lbs, athletic female

Current a1c reading: 5.8

More symptoms relating to prediabetes: thinning hair, skin tag, passing out after eating carbs, tired after waking up

My Anxiety about Prediabetes:

-My mom passed away last year due to pancreatic cancer. She lamented about her blood sugar not being in control for the last year of her life. 

-My father has stage 4 CKD, presumably from not having his blood sugar and hypertension under control for many years. He has kept his condition at bay for about 20 years now with a super strict diet that I’d really don’t want to have to experience.

-I know that I have a love for eating carbs. For most of my life, even though I ate clean with veggies and fruits, and very little refined sugar, there were months where I would irresponsibly eat food like pizza, croissants and baguettes without any kind of buffer. I assume this is why I am in this pre-diabetic condition now (in addition to my family genetics with predisposition for diabetes and high blood pressure). 

I’m feeling down because while I am sure I can bring down my A1c with discipline, I don’t think that I will be able to actually reverse my insulin resistance. I’ve been on a CGM for two weeks now and it looks like my body is very sensitive to any kind of carbs. For example, this morning I had two eggs, two egg whites, and 70 g of blueberries, unsweetened almond milk with my mushroom coffee. And my blood sugar went up to 170.


Positives about my situation:

-I can be super disciplined and can eat very clean for 95% of my time. 

-I discovered CGMs and I’m able to purchase them without a prescription right now.

-I lift heavy weights and do light steady state cardio weekly. 10 K steps a day. I am quite disciplined with fitness.

-on a positive note, ever since I’ve worked on trying to stabilize my blood sugar, I no longer feel hungry, even though I’m in a calorie deficit at the moment.

Feeling Negative about:

-I’ve been carefully tracking my food and I’m getting very frustrated at certain foods that I am eating give me no spikes one week, and it will give me a steep spike (150+) in the next week despite eating at a pretty strict timing schedule

-my favorite drink of choice, champagne, does not give me any spikes. In fact, having a glass with a meal helps lower my blood sugar, but then I will have scary hypoglycemic drops a few hours later which carries into the night <55 according to Lingo. Really hoping I won’t have to cut out a glass of champagne here and there. 

-I am prone to hypoglycemic swings during the week before my menstrual cycle. I’m wondering if my hypoglycemic swings make my A1c as low as it is since 5.7-5.8 it’s still lower on the prediabetes spectrum, but I had previously experienced a lot of different symptoms.

-Since I’m here to vent, I’m exhausted from having to come up with so many clean meals for myself as well as my toddler. It’s been really hard to take care of myself, let alone on trying to get my kid to eat healthy as well so hopefully he doesn’t end up with this issue. I hope my life does not revolve around timed eating and going for walks but it’s kind of looking that way. I’m feeling a loss of mental freedom.


Blessings:

-I’m grateful that I have access to fresh food and I have time to make it for myself

-I’m grateful that I live in a place that I can safely go for walks after meals. Trying not to feel negative or trapped that I have to go for walks after meals. Although, I don’t know how I’m going to manage these walks when I’m with friends or events.

-blessed for technology and ChatGPT to talk to when I have little questions throughout the day about this condition. ChatGPT helps me plan my meals and snack snacks when my brain is absolutely fried from work, motherhood and life

-blessed for my CGM, even though though it’s not perfect, it’s been very eye-opening

-I’m blessed and grateful to feel much better than I did a few months ago thanks to my CGM and having a better understanding of this condition


I feel better letting this out.

It was either move to a newly-discovered alien world with breathable air and ""somewhat manageable wildlife,"" or spend another winter in a studio apartment that doubled as a sauna anytime he boiled water.

The trees were purple and squealed when touched, the sky was a mood ring of colors based on planetary emotion (currently: hangry), and the sun set at noon, then came back for an encore performance at 3 PM.

Seth’s ""apartment"" was actually the hollowed shell of a mega snail—a former intergalactic beast that had once terrorized local villagers but now sported Wi-Fi and a compost toilet. It was listed as a “cozy 1-bedroom with rustic slime accents” on the planetary housing app ZlorpSpace.

He shared a neighborhood with a delightful blob creature named Gleeb, who introduced himself by gently osmosing onto Seth’s leg and whispering, “You smell like sandwich.”

They’ve been best friends ever since.


---

Every morning, Seth walked to his job at a translation kiosk inside the planet’s only mall: GalaxiCo MegaCenter. His boss, a sentient cube named Deborah, had a face on each side and a very unhealthy obsession with Earth reality TV.

“I simply adore that one human with the eyebrows,” she gushed once, all six mouths grinning. “What do you call her again? Judge Judy?”

Seth’s job mostly involved helping alien customers make sense of human slang.

“No, no,” he told a spiky creature named Tharnz, “when a human says something ‘slaps,’ they don’t mean to be physically assaulted by it. Well. Not always.”

Sometimes Seth missed Earth—coffee that didn’t hum, cereal that didn’t whisper riddles, and Wi-Fi that didn’t scream when overloaded. But for the most part, he liked his new life.

Until the rent thing happened.


---

It started when the Glorbnakian Housing Council—an assembly of ancient floating jellyfish who communicated entirely in limericks—decided to implement a “modest tax increase” on Earth residents.

The new rent for Seth’s snail-shell home? 8,000 galactic credits per moon cycle.

Seth, naturally, had the emotional reaction of a man who had once been charged $9 for oat milk and still brings it up during therapy.

“I don’t have 8,000 credits!” he told Gleeb, pacing the gooey living room. “I have, like, seven. And a coupon for half-off galactic pizza.”

“Maybe you should mate with Deborah,” Gleeb offered helpfully, turning into a chair.

“What?”

“Boss mating often reduces rent. Happens all the time on Blob Sector 14.”

Seth considered this. He did like Deborah—especially her sassy corner face—but romance wasn’t his go-to conflict resolution strategy. His plan had always been to panic internally until the universe changed its mind.

Instead, he marched back to the council and made a passionate plea, translated from English into limerick via a pocket device called The Bard-o-Matic 9000.

“There once was a man from the stars,
Who couldn’t afford Glorbnak bars.
He worked every day,
But got little pay,
So maybe don’t charge him for Mars?”

The jellyfish blinked slowly—if one can call undulating gently in the air “blinking”—then communed with the Great Bioluminescent Mind. Ten minutes later, they offered a compromise:

“Pay us in culture.”


---

That’s how Seth became Glorbnak-9’s Cultural Ambassador—a glorified title that mostly meant “Earth clown.”

Every week, he hosted Earth Culture Nights in the community square, which was really just a crater with a disco ball.

One week, he taught aliens how to line dance. Another week, he introduced them to the sacred human tradition of karaoke. (Gleeb’s rendition of “Total Eclipse of the Heart” was so moving it started a rainstorm.)

Seth even opened an interstellar food truck called Hot Pockets & Existential Dread, where he sold microwaved delicacies and gave TED-style talks on the futility of late-stage capitalism.

He became beloved. The locals made memes about him. Someone even knitted him a sweater that said “HUMAN: Tolerable and Moist.”


---

One day, while teaching a workshop titled ""Sitcoms, Sarcasm, and Why Everyone Hated Ross,"" Seth was approached by a visiting Earth tourist.

“Wait,” the guy said, blinking. “You live here? Voluntarily?”

Seth shrugged. “The rent’s cheaper. The people are nice. And where else can you get fried helium with a side of cosmic empathy?”

Back on Earth, Seth had been another faceless paycheck away from disaster. Here, he was the weird human guy who taught aliens to play Uno and convinced Deborah to star in a Glorbnakian reboot of The Bachelor.

And yeah, sometimes the toilets shrieked at night and once he got abducted by a well-meaning cloud, but life was good. Weird, squishy, and frequently glowing—but good.


---

As the triple suns dipped below the horizon in an overly dramatic celestial musical number, Seth sat outside his snail-shell home, sipping a cup of spiced Glorbnak sap.

Gleeb oozed up beside him.

“You think you’ll ever go back to Earth?”

Seth grinned. “Only if I can’t find good Wi-Fi here.”

The sky changed to a soft teal—a planetary sign of contentment.

And somewhere in the distance, Deborah’s cube-like laughter echoed across the hills.

Each of these drinks, as mentioned in the title, would grant your avatar different effects when consumed. Wish would then give your avatar a drink that she believes will help them, either by giving them something they lack/reducing some of their weaknesses or by strengthening some aspect of them. Therefore, you would have to describe **your avatar's powers, abilities, weaknesses, resistances**, etc. Anything related to that!

While you need to list that, I suppose I could also base it on their appearance; for example, checking if they have weapons, if they have armor, if they're wearing casual clothes and resemble normal humans, if they look sturdy, if they look tired or lazy, etc. **As always, feel free to share any additional info about your avatar that you think might help me make a better decision.** I'd appreciate it!",10,1748460568.0,RobloxAvatars,12,1.0,False

I am a single mom.

I was gifted with the terrible honor of spearheading a car wash fundraiser for the school, something that I absolutely didn’t want to do, but will get me out of having to run anything in the fall, and the fall events are insane to plan.

I am friendly with the other parents in PTA. Angela’s husband, Peter, volunteered to help and was my biggest helper overall. The day of the car wash, I had to get to the school super early and set up. On my way, I stopped and grabbed a couple of breakfast burritos, and some coffees. This place also has these biscotti that Peter mentioned he used to get when he still had to commute for work. I grabbed one for him. We were the only 2 who were going to be there until much later.

When he arrived, Angela was with him. I didn’t expect this or I would have gotten her something as well. I called him over and handed him the coffee and breakfast burrito. The biscotti was in my purse. I remembered it about 10 minutes later and said “Oh, Peter, wait, I got you something!” and gave him the biscotti. He was thrilled and showed it to Angela, saying something like “Wasn’t I just saying I missed getting these?”

Angela scowled at the biscotti. In the moment I figured maybe he wasn’t supposed to eat sweets or something due to health issues? But I didn’t know and didn’t think about too much.

So then the day after the event, Angela texted and asked me why I’d brought her man a gift.

I didn’t know what to say so I let it sit for a while. Then I replied “I figured he could use a bite for a longday.”

Angela said “That’s not your business, mind your own husband.” She obviously knows I’m a single mom, but I don’t really know if she meant to make it a dig. I don’t want to assume that. 

Unfortunately the situation escalated as these things tend to with groups of parents. Warring factions have taken sides, the hussies versus the cool girls. I could add a bunch of boring details but this is the core of it. Was I wrong to buy him breakfast? ",0,1748460560.0,AmItheAsshole,29,0.5,False

So my ex (29F) and I (25F) broke up about five months ago, we dated for almost three years, lived together for one and a half, it ended badly but not catastrophically, no screaming matches or cheating, just a slow build of resentment, too many unsaid things, passive aggressive little arguments that never really got resolved, just swept under the rug until the rug looked like it was hiding a body. I was the one who brought up the breakup, which she says makes me the villain, but it wasn’t like I blindsided her, I had tried to talk about how things felt off, how we were both exhausted all the time, like the relationship had become more work than joy, and she would just go cold, say things like ""I'm not in the mood for this,"" or ""Why are you always picking at scabs?"" so I gave it space, I waited, and then finally I said it, I think we should break up, and she just stared at me for a long time, said ""Wow,"" and left the apartment for two days. Since then, it's been a mess of half-communication, shared custody of the dog (her idea), occasional texting that always turns weird, like she wants to fight but also wants to keep me in her orbit, like I'm not her girlfriend anymore but she doesn't want me to be free either, I don't know, maybe that's unfair. Anyway, the reason I'm posting is because of a fight we had last week, if you can even call it a fight, it felt more like a scripted spiral.

She texted me out of nowhere: 

*""Do you even feel bad about how you treated me?""*

I said:

*""I do, I think about it a lot actually, I wish we had handled things differently, I wish I'd been better at saying things instead of letting them pile up.""*

She replied: 

*""So now it's all your fault? I'm the bad guy again? Classic.""*

And I just stared at that message because what the hell? I wasn’t blaming her, I wasn’t even saying it was all my fault, I was trying to take responsibility, or at least acknowledge my part in it, but she twisted it into this accusation, like I was gaslighting her, when all I did was answer her question honestly.

I told her:

 *""That's not what I meant. I just meant I regret how things ended, and I know I played a role in that.""*

She left me on read for two days, then sent me a meme of a possum in a trash can that said ""me thriving"" and I genuinely didn’t know if that was meant to be funny or sad or passive aggressive or all three, so I didn’t respond. Three hours later she texted:

 *""Wow. Just like when we were together. You never say anything unless it’s comfortable for you.""*

I told her I was confused, that I didn’t know what she wanted from me, that I wasn’t trying to ignore her, I just didn’t know how to react to a trash possum meme as a follow-up to a semi-fight, and she hit back with this huge wall of text about how I always made her feel like a burden, how I never made her feel safe, how I’d never be able to handle being with someone who actually had feelings, and yeah, that one stung, because I tried, I really did, I went to therapy, I read all the relationship books she left scattered around the apartment, I bit my tongue a thousand times when she came home in a mood and needed to vent, I held her when she cried about her mom, about her job, about nothing in particular, and I never asked her to be less, just maybe sometimes to let me in.

But I didn’t say any of that. I just told her:

 *""I'm sorry you felt that way.""*

To which she replied:

 *""Wow, weaponized therapy speak.""*

Like what do you even say to that? Anything I say becomes another piece of evidence for whatever case she's building against me, and silence is interpreted as proof that I never cared, but here's the part that really messes with my head. She came over two days later to pick up the dog, and she brought me a coffee, just how I like it, and said:

*""I figured you were probably having a rough week,""*

She smiled like nothing had happened, like we hadn’t been digging trenches via iMessage for the past 72 hours.

I said thanks, I tried to smile back, I didn’t know what else to do. She sat on the couch for a while, played with the dog, asked me how work was, told me she started boxing classes, and it was almost normal, almost easy, until I asked her if she wanted to talk about the texts and she just shut down completely, said:

*""Why do you always have to ruin nice things by dissecting them?""*

So yeah. I don’t know. Am I just an ass for trying to be thoughtful with her? for not fighting back when she lashes out, for giving her the benefit of the doubt when she swings between cold and caring? Some of my friends say I need to block her and move on, others say I owe her patience because she’s clearly hurting, but it feels like whatever I do, I’m wrong, either I’m cold or I’m too soft, either I’m emotionally stunted or I’m manipulating her with kindness",1,1748460483.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Again, these are very stream of conscious, jotted down in my stupid lil phone as I sat reading a book. I didn't look at the notes, as a fun little experiment. So please ignore any abject stupidity in the reviews, sometimes I suck at picking out notes. 🫡

**Black Hearted Tart:** 

**69 Roses:** A rose garden in the sun, perfumey roses + citrus-y roses + jammy roses. Bunks was super into this one lol. Roses! Like being beaten with a bouquet of roses. I like this quite a bit, _shocking no one_. It smells like I soaked myself in rosewater with rose petals floating in it, then washed with rose soap and slathered on rose lotion. Heck yea. Roses.

_Actual notes: A modern rose scent created with freshly cut long stemmed pink roses.  Light touches of peony and violet soften the scent further.  A bit of garden greenery adds an herbaceous essence._ Well. Ok. Lmao. I can ID the violet now, which I was chalking up to a soapy tea rose note. I'm guessing peony was adding to the fruity-rose vibe. I don't get any greenery though tbh. (Bunks is my dog btw.)

**Strawberry Creampuff:** Strawberry scented My Little Pony. 100%, start to finish. Pure unbridled nostalgia. That's it that's the whole review. 

*Actual notes: Juicy, ripe, summer strawberries are drizzled with simple syrup and topped with dollops of sweet cream atop a vanilla puff pastry.* So obviously, the notes were self explanatory. I ordered this because 1) I love Shonen Knife and Strawberry Creampuff goes hard. And 2) BHT said it reminded people of scented dolls and I wanted to see if it smelled like the scented MLPs I had as a kid and _it totally does._ Straight up Strawberry Surprise.

**Wild Honey:** Orange blossom creamed honey. On skin it's less creamy and more golden translucent honey. Bergamot? Floral honey and citrus. This would be amazing in a lotion. It smells like warm sunshine. This is close to my deodorant but more honey heavy. Mom would probably like this. I like it more than expected for a honey forward thing. It's not as sticky sweet as honey often reads.

*Actual notes: Rich honey and fragrant pollen combine with subtle notes of fresh hay and beeswax absolute. Delicate floral notes of mimosa and jasmine add a slight powdery freshness. Bergamot brightens the golden amber musk base.* Hey look at that, there is bergamot! I am really into bergamot haha.  This smells sunny and happy and frolicsome and other words for happy. 

**Darling Clandestine** 

**Aragon:** Well worn leather, with an herbal- floral note and.... chocolate? But like a hint. Like smelling a dark chocolate bar in the wrapper. Dry lavender. Dries to sweetened leather,  which sounds weird but works here. The sweet is...almost recognizable... toffee? Maybe? This feels like a cousin to Inked. If Inked is for sexy sea creatures, this is her desert dwelling cousin.

*Actual notes: Bright, crisp lavender deepened with sea salt and wine, a bit of leather and a touch of chocolate and caramel.* Aha! I was close. This is one of those quintessential DC type blends. So unusual but well executed. 

**Brasao y Kinolau:** Bitter greens, like a bell pepper, but warm like a hot day. Florals instantly appear on skin. Lush tropical vibes with that bitter green backing. Like pulling weeds in a garden in bloom. The green isn't bell pepper, but leaves. Azalea maybe? Something dark green and snappy. A hot weather scent that could totally work in cool weather. The florals and greens are 50/50, I would call this more atmospheric than floral. 

*Actual notes: Fresh, green, non-Christmasy holly, pink peppercorn and old-world wonders, fused with the maile vines of Hawai'i, lotus, honeysuckle, jasmine, spiced with a tiny touch of cinnamon and sweetened with coconut and honey.* Ok... well. I had the spirit I guess lol. Holly 100% makes sense. It was super familiar to me and my previous house had holly bushes everywhere because the original owners were sadists, I guess. I'm not normally one for green scents but this one works. 

**Inked:** Ughhhh, it's so good. Leather, skin warmed and salt sprayed. I can't even ramble about this. It's just really good. Like your skin but better for sirens/seahags. The wine is a dry sweetness that does not read as cloying or grape. Absolutely peak in the heat. Like a fantasy version of sweaty skin. I missed you, you weird little scent. 

*Actual notes: A sting of sea salt and leather, splashes of communion wine, the essence of raw skin.** Ok this one I did know the notes because I owned this before, gave it to a friend, regretted it, bought it again. It's good y'all. It's hot weather perfection. 

**Arcana Craves**

**Coconuts Craves Luna:** Creamy coconut and soft florals. Moonflower??? Nope. Cherry blossom for sure once on. Maybe coconut milk. The cherry blossom is front and center. Feels very clean and sheer. Coconut starts to peek back out. Smells like shredded coconut. Dry and white. This is actually really pretty. 

*Actual notes: White coconut with cherry blossoms, fine French lavender, and a trio of white musks.* Boom baby. Cherry blossom. And some really nice, non-shrieky white musks! 

**Coconuts Crave Softness:** Tropical coconut and sweet skin musk. Ohhh whoa. Not skin musk. Vanilla! Buttery coconut and rich vanilla. This smells like you went to a spa in a tropical resort hotel and you came out smelling like a beach goddess. The vanilla note in this is really pretty. I keep thinking I get a hint of spice but I can't pinpoint it. Like the mere concept of cinnamon. 

_Actual notes: Gentle coconut with Mexican vanilla, Tahitian vanilla, and delicious crème anglaise._ .... I'm honestly shocked I bought something with a cream note. They usually go disgusting on me. This was nice in a very unobjectionable way. 

**Coconuts Crave Temples:** Warm coconut + husk and dry incense. Slightly tropical. Dry and not particularly smoky. The incense is more woody than resinous. Sandalwood incense. Coconut is losing the battle against the incense but I'm not mad about it. Shinto shrine but make it beach. Vaguely reminiscent of Black Sands but like... turned way down and softened up. 

*Actual notes: Green coconut, coconut milk, sheer sandalwood, a hint of smoky guiacwood, and a bit of white iris.* Well I definitely know why I bought this. Frisk was nice and I love iris and incense. I would've bet it was coconut husk though. I wore this to meet my mom for coffee and I was not thrilled with the throw at first but the heat really cranks it up.

**Honey Craves Sunshowers:** A light clear honey, cardamom???, and a salty-mineral note. Cardamom blast on the skin! Now I remember why I got this lol. There's something almost tart in the background but it's drowning in cardamom. This is really nice. Cardamom summer. I don't get any petrichor or aquatic/rain notes. It's lightly sweet but the honey isn't in your face honey. 

*Actual notes: A big dose of warm cardamom is pierced with bright sunshine and scattered raindrops, then softened with Tahitian vanilla, sheer georgette, salty Ambroxan, and wildflower honey.* Strangely the salty note vanished on skin, but reappeared after I washed it off. This was for my mom, who adores both honey and cardamom.

**Peaches Crave Mermaidcore:** Salty tart peaches. More peachy but still salty on. There's something else in here but I can't put my finger on it. Cashmere maybe, or something like a wool accord? It reminds me of bpal Peach Sweater & London Fog.  So I'm guessing bergamot is in there. Salty peachy fog sweater. I kinda fuck with it tbh. 

*Actual notes: Rich woods and ambergris with yellow peaches, Sicilian bergamot, cashmere, sparkling sea salt, amber resin, silk organza, and a single magnolia petal.* I would've guessed white peaches, but yellow makes sense. The woods are well hidden though. And look! Bergamot is back! Yay! This is BPAL Peach Sweater at the beach. 


And there you have it. A lovely bunch of Coconuts ^(deedlydee) and some other stuff. All vaguely summery, since it's already been hitting the 90s here. 🫠 I didn't immediately run to FS any of these Arcana, but Temples, Luna, and Mermaidcore are tempting. Am I supposed to be decluttering? Yes. Am I still determined to try as many things as possible before we move? Also yes. And thus, I'm stuck in a infinite loop of being dumb, but oh well. There's worse fates. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

My coffee’s gone cold while I stare into the abyss of adulthood, trying to shape my thoughts into something that makes sense.

Summer’s coming, and the world’s still shouting about “hot girl summers” and “main character energy.” Meanwhile, I’m here, reheating leftovers and wondering when “adulting” starts feeling less like a simulation.

If you’re also:  
- Secretly proud of your “adulting” wins (e.g., remembering to water a plant *twice*) 
- Secretly wondering if *anyone* actually has their life together    
- Stuck in the post-Covid “time warp” (*Is it 2020? 2023? Who knows*)  
- Tired of performative hustle culture but still want to *grow*, not just survive  
- Secretly proud of tiny wins (*“I remembered to hydrate today!”*) 

Maybe we'd get along

**Why this isn’t a sadboy manifesto:**  
If you…  
- Believe “connection” can start with shared confusion and moments like ""is this normal?""  
- Want to rebuild *something* habits, hobbies, or maybe (hopefully) a slow-burn connection
- Think “wholesome” means laughing at burnt cookies together, not performative Pinterest vibes  

Let’s exchange ideas:  
- Strategies for reading books again  
- Ways to adult without selling your soul to hustle culture  
- Secretly hopeful ideas for dating in a world obsessed with swiping

**The quiet ask:**  
Maybe we’ll start a two-person book club that becomes a “why is this pizza so good?” diary. Maybe we’ll trauma-bond over the absurdity of LinkedIn influencers and 5 years working experience required to land your first job **Or if the stars align we’ll find something warm and real**, like that scene in *Before Sunrise* where they just… talk. 

*Bonus points if:*
- Your love language is “sending a song that explains your soul at 2am”  
- You still believe in slow, sincere connection (but also won’t judge my *Trash Reality TV* shame-watch)",1,1748459865.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1kxpsy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kxpsy2/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_its_unfair_for_me/,AITA for telling my friend that it’s unfair for me to be on stand-by just because she has kids?,"This happened a few weeks ago but I’m still thinking about it. 

My (36F) friend (39F) has two kids (2&6 yo) with her husband. We’ve known in each for 10 years and in all those years, not once has she showed up on time. Doesn’t matter if it’s a casual coffee date, a play, my birthday dinner - she’s always late and usually no less than 20 minutes. One time she even managed to be 45 minutes late to a dinner she invited me to because “she just needed to grab a few things on the way”. 

I have tried to talk to her about it many times in different ways and make her understand how I feel. I hate being late and don’t appreciate others being late more than the customary 5-10 minutes either, especially if they don’t give me a heads up because it feels dismissive and like my time is not as important as theirs. She’s always brushed it off, so I’ve just started to add about 20 minutes to any time we’re supposed to meet. I don’t like it, but it sort of works since we don’t see each other as much as we used to. 

A few weeks ago we decided to go for a walk, just the two of us. She pushed the time about an hour because the youngest needed to be put down for a nap which was fine. As always, I went out right around the time we were supposed to meet and actually ended up being a few minutes late myself because I took a wrong turn and got lost. 

When I showed up, she commented on it, I apologized and we got to talking. She started going on about how she couldn’t set a time if we wanted to meet because it didn’t always work out with the kids and lots of unpredictable stuff could happen. Her take was that it would be better if we could meet between for example 1 and 2pm and she could just text me whenever she’s ready. We don’t live that far apart and usually meet somewhere in the middle, but it would still mean that I’d have to sit on stand-by for whenever she feels ready (and I am sure an hour would not be enough with her time management abilities) and couldn’t really plan my day very efficiently. 

So I told her that I get how kids are unpredictable and I don’t mind a bit of lateness because of that, but I also don’t think it’s fair to me to just sit and wait on her for however long just because she has children. Her husband is super involved and has had no issues with taking both kids for an evening, so I know it’s doable - and all my other friends are completely able to be on time despite having small children as well. 

She sort of got quietly annoyed and said “well, that’s just how it is”, which I guess is code for “live with it” which is why I think I might be the asshole in her mind. But on the other hand, I don’t think it’s fair to me at all because it’s not a question of her having responsibilities, but more an excuse to finally just not give a crap about other people’s time and plans. 

So, AITA?

Eyes open → scroll Reddit → check email → lose 30 minutes.   
  
Then I'd sprint to the shower and do all the other crap.

A few months ago, when my baby was born, I knew something had to give. I didn’t want my kid’s earliest memories of me to be the top of my head glued to a screen.

So I started doing **phone-free mornings**.

Try it, seriously. This is what I do:

* My phone stays in grayscale until 9AM
* Social media and email apps are totally blocked until then (no override possible... even for Reddit)
* I make coffee, read a real book or magazine (I like a self-help book or Kiplinger) and just chill

At first it felt like a detox, now it's just part of my routine.   
I think clearer. I have more energy. And I’m actually present when my baby wakes up -- not rushing to catch up from wasting the morning.

If you're a new dad, I'd highly recommend trying it. Start here:

1. Use iOS Shortcuts to switch your phone to grayscale until 9AM automatically
2. Start reading a bit
3. Get a serious app blocker
4. Stop drinking coffee. Just kidding.

Recommend trying it. What do you guys do to make mornings more bearable?",135,1748459801.0,daddit,46,0.92,False

He’s watching me… again.  
It would be one thing if he was doing it with interest or even just an acknowledgement, but it’s not like that. It’s like he has a permanent scowl on his face, and it’s directed at me the whole time.  
After the morning I’ve had, I’m over it, and I’m barely able to contain myself.  
I am representing Glaze Bakery. I can’t tell off customers. I chant the little reminder to myself, but the little devil on my shoulder reminds me that this guy is not a customer. He’s always here when we set up the food truck, but he’s never bought anything.  
He always just sits there, peeking at me over his computer, scowling.  
“You okay?” Teresa nudges me in the ribs.  
I grunt in response. How else should I respond? I had to deal with my ex at the Co-op location this morning, and now I have to deal with the scowling asshole at the Heroes Rehab Center. I can’t seem to catch a break.  
Teresa puts a hand on my shoulder. “Look, forget about Adam. He’s an asshole, and everyone knows it.”  
I put a hand on my hip. “I’m not mad at Adam. I’m mad at myself. I broke up with him because he treated me like shit, and I hate that even now, I’m letting him keep doing it. I should have said something. I should have….”  
Teresa holds her hand up. “Look, don’t beat yourself up about it. That’s the last thing you should be doing.”  
I suck in a deep breath. “I know, but the food truck is new for Glaze, and I don’t want to cause any drama around it. Emery is counting on me and?—”  
Teresa stomps her foot. “Emery would not want you to let any man disrespect you.”  
I suck in a breath and let it out slowly. “You’re right. I know you’re right.” I nod my head toward the back of the picnic tables. “See that guy?”  
She looks around the tables, and the sassy Teresa that I’ve come to love is back in full force. “There’s like fifteen men sitting out there, and yeah, I’ve looked at them all. This is my favorite location by far.”  
She’s wiggling her eyebrows, and even in the bad mood I’m in, I can’t stop the laugh from coming out. “You’re crazy.”  
She nods her head in agreement. “Yeah, I am. Now tell me which guy. You hookin’ up? Because you know that’s what you need to do, right? You need to get laid.”  
As soon as she says the words, there’s a giggle at the window. I push Teresa to the side. “I’m so sorry that you had to hear that. What can I get you?”  
The curvy brown-haired woman looks up at me with amused brown eyes. “I’ll take a chocolate croissant and an iced coffee, please.”  
Almost awkwardly, I start the coffee while Teresa disappears. Of course, she’s going to go hide right now. When I have the order ready, I hand it through the window. “That will be seven-fifty.”  
She taps her card to pay and doesn’t immediately walk away. “I’m Brooklyn,” she says, introducing herself.  
My face flames. Everyone in Whiskey Run knows Walker. He owns half the damn town, including the Heroes Rehab Center. Brooklyn is his wife. I knew who she was as soon as I saw her, and if there’s anyone that I’d want to make a good impression on, it’s her. “I know. I’m Poppy. It’s nice to meet you.”She opens her mouth, and I can’t stop myself from rambling. “Anyway, I want to apologize. I promise that we’ll keep things professional here, and I don’t want you or your husband to worry. All professional from here on out.”  


She sets her coffee down and pinches off a bite of the croissant. After chewing and swallowing, she nods. “I’m not worried. Everyone loves when Glaze stops by.” She waves her hand behind her at the group of men and women behind her. “And Walker is happy you’re here because then I don’t have to go into town to get my daily dose of caffeine. I told Emery if you can add more stops here to your calendar we would love it, and I’ll make sure the center is aware.”  


I let out a breath of relief. “Okay, thank you. I’ll double-check with her and let you know.”  


She grabs up her coffee, and I’m sure she’s about to walk away, but she surprises me. “And your friend is right, you know. You should never let a man make you feel less than.”  


I grimace. “You heard that?”  


She nods. “Yeah and the part where she said you needed to get laid.”  


By this point, I’m wishing a big hole would open up and swallow me. “Uhhhh,” I stutter, not sure what I can say to make this sound good. I just gave a speech to this woman about how we’re professional, and now I’m talking to her about getting laid.

Yeah, I’m sorry you had to hear that.”  


She waves me off. “Don’t apologize. Your friend reminds me of my sister, Cassie. And just so you know, my sister is usually right.” She smiles and gives me a wave. “Let me know if your schedule opens up any.”  


I wave with a big dumb smile on my face because I’m not sure what to say. I’m pretty sure Brooklyn just told me I needed to go get laid.  


“So who is it?”  


As soon as Brooklyn walks away, Teresa is back in the truck by my side. “Really, you just left? Drop a bombshell about me”—I lower my voice to a whisper—“‘getting laid,’ and then walk off so I can deal with the aftermath.”  


Teresa snorts. “It’s fine. She was laughing when she walked away, it’s all good. Now which guy? Is he still here?”  


She gestures wildly with her head toward the picnic tables. I’m surprised to see some people have left, but the one man still remains, staring at me.  


“Forget it,” I tell her.  


She shakes her head. “Oh no, you can’t do that. You can’t bring it up that you’re interested in a guy and then drop it.”  


I pick up a dish towel and throw it to her. “Start cleaning up. I’m going to let people know we’re closing up in thirty minutes if they want anything before we go.”  


Teresa rolls her eyes at me, but I just laugh and walk out of the truck. I stop at the first table. “Hey guys, I just wanted to let you know we’re closing up in thirty minutes in case you want to get anything to go.”  
They nod their thanks, and I move to the next table of women and repeat my speech.  
One woman bolts up. “Ooooh, thank you. I wanted to get some cupcakes to take home for my family.”  
I tell her the selection we have left, and as she walks up to the truck, I go to the next table. I’m getting closer to the man in the back, and I can feel my blood pressure rising. He’s openly glaring at me, and in my head, I’m imagining everything he’s thinking.  
“A fat girl working at a dessert truck.”  
Do you make any money or eat all the profits?”  
“You really shouldn’t be surrounded by all that food because you don’t have the willpower not to eat it.”  
Everything Adam said to me when he found out I was going to start working at the Glaze Bakery Food Truck crosses my mind. I was so excited to get the job, and he ruined it for me. I almost turned down the job offer until I came to my senses. I grew up making pastries with my grandma, and it’s something I love to do. Plus, instead of being cooped up inside all day, I get to travel around and meet new people. And let’s face it, almost all our customers are happy to see us. So I got rid of the boyfriend instead of the job.  
But seeing the strange man glowering at me reminds me of everything that my ex said. I clench my hands into fists and mentally prepare myself for when I get to his table because I’m over men treating me like shit and getting away with it. Like Brooklyn said, I’m done letting men treat me as if I’m less than.",1,1748459734.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

On Tuesday it started ok, did a lot of work, but at the half of the day I got anxiety, and got really exhausted at the end of the day. Today I had anxiety from the first hour, with palpitations and anxiety the whole day. At the end of the day I had really bad mood.

- sleep was ok every day, only took a bit more time to fall asleep
- appetite is horrible (usually I’m not eating breakfast, so I take the medication at empty stomach). Today I forced myself to eat during the day and drink but it was hard
-I drink coffee every day
- I started to smoke a lot! Before the medication 1-2 cigarettes/day. Now almost 10! 

About the anxiety: it gets ok when i focus on something or talk to people. It is horrible when I’m alone and have time to think about how I feel.. 

Tomorrow I will have an exam so I’m not sure if stay at 50 mg and eat breakfast before, avoid caffeine and drink a lot OR try to take ~ half of the capsule. 

My doctor said 50 mg will be the dose for me

1kxpdqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeingScaredStories/comments/1kxpdqk/what_is_this_a_mimic/,What is this? A mimic?,"I used to work at a local restaurant in an old building with some, shall we say, peculiarities. Apparently, it had quite the local reputation for being a paranormal hotspot, but this was something the owners were big on hushing up whenever they heard any sort of talk about it. The local Haunted Walk group, that takes tourists on night tours of the old town core, even approached them at one point and asked if they could use them as a stop on their tour and the owners refused. They said it was 'bad publicity' but in an old historic city with heavy tourism numbers, it makes it seem a bit more like they are afraid of acknowledging paranormal activity in their building, which is perfectly valid, I suppose...

There are a few 'entities' and some backstories to all of them. One is a young woman, apparently from when the building was a dance hall, one is a grumpy fat old man, and one is a man in overalls we collectively call 'The Porter'.

People didn't like the old man as he had a negative energy associated with him but he wasn't really around much. Unless you were a woman, he didn't bother you and you probably didn't even ever encounter him.

The Porter is benign enough, he has a blue light and a melancholy energy associated with him, but he isn't a malevolent spirit and can usually just be seen leaning up against walls or hauling what appear to be barrels down the main hallway.

The young woman is the one that makes people feel the most unsettled. She doesn't really come with an energy that is off-putting, and she isn't scary or malevolent outright, but it's the fact that she seems to be able to shapeshift into people we all know. At first it's really hard to spot for people, but eventually they see right through the disguise and realize it's not actually who they think it is walking across the dining room, or through the door, down the line or up the stairs.

Workers will catch a glimpse of them, thinking they are seeing one of their work friends and will call to them only to go unanswered and be ignored. This entity is assumed to be a young woman because they only ever shapeshift into the female staff of the restaurant. They also would not make a sound as they sped to wherever they were heading unless they were still and silently standing slightly out of sight. They would always eventually wander away or otherwise not be seen for the rest of the morning, but no matter what you did, if you verbalized to them or tried to get their attention, they would not answer.  
They didn't seem to have their own specific look but rather had preferred staff members they liked to mimic. We weren't sure this had to do with a preference that the spirit might have had, or if they appear to somebody who is likely to get an interaction out of an observer.

When this happened to me I saw a girl named Courtney who frequently would work the opening shifts up front whenever I would.

I was quietly working away opening up for that day's service, and while I was busy chopping away I looked up and saw her walk by, over to where the lockers are.

""Hey,"" I said.

No answer… she must not have heard me.

I figured she was coming in early to get ready here or something and just went back to work figuring I would catch her on her way out, only after ten more minutes Courtney had come bustling through the door, coffee in hand calling out hello and hurrying over to the locker room. I'm not sure what I witnessed but it was bizarre. I felt as though I hallucinated her and that I must have been seeing things, but I'm not the only one who has had this experience working here. This only happened to me one other time, where I swore a girl named Caitlyn had come in to work her shift and that I had seen her getting ready behind the bar under similar circumstances only for her to not be in that day. Two other people and a manager have both had experiences like mine, and in all three scenarios they didn't respond to a thing anybody said or interact with anybody in any way. What makes this even more strange is it seems to mimic people we expect to be showing up shortly, or people who haven't been in for a while. Whatever this is, it seems to know who to turn into depending on who's working and that's what makes it unsettling. If it's our eyes playing tricks on us—it doesn't account for half your colleagues seeing the same unexplainable phenomenon on a regular basis.

Is this some sort of ghost? A demon? Residual energy?

How does it know who to mimic? And how? Why is it that it won't speak? Can it not mimic voices?

Or is it just some sort of residual recording of energy flow… like a needle skipping over a record.

Some of the staff who would see it were extremely unsettled by the idea that it can read your thoughts and change shape. It led a lot of people to assume that it was a negative entity and if they see it they warn not to engage. I'm not sure what happens, or if anything actually would happen being that I had called out to it once before, but they see it as bad luck and not a good thing to do by any means.

I'm not sure how I feel about the whole thing personally. Years later I still really have no explanation for it, but the more I think about it, the less the idea that it would be residual energy makes sense. Why would it change? I never saw any of the other entities while I was working there but I did see her; if it is indeed a her.

It’s awkward, it’s slow, and honestly, it’s easy to ignore.

Here’s a better way: **run ads directly to realtors using Facebook Custom Audiences.**

If you’ve got a loan program that can help them sell more houses (like 203K, down payment assistance, DSCR, or HELOCs for investors), then put that in front of them — *strategically* 

Here’s how:

**1. Build a list of local realtors**  
Scrape emails from local MLS sites, real estate Facebook groups, or Realtor.com. You don’t need thousands — a few hundred good contacts is enough.

**2. Upload your list into Facebook Ads Manager**  
Create a Custom Audience using that email list. Facebook will match as many of those as possible to real profiles (even better if you have names and phone numbers too).

**3. Create a targeted ad with value**  
Example:

>

Make it short, visual, and clear who it’s for. Don’t pitch yourself. Just explain the tool and how it helps them sell. Add a picture of you on the ad creative so they start to recognize you and your name.

**4. Run your ad to that audience only**  
You’re not wasting money trying to reach everyone. You’re speaking directly to the people who need to know you exist.

**5. Use a lead form or calendar link**  
Let them opt in for more info, or book a time to talk if they want. No pressure. Just give them the option.

This flips the script. Now agents are seeing *you* as the resource — not the other way around.",1,1748458779.0,LoanOfficerLeads,0,1.0,False

I finally got off all the meds I thought were causing the weight gain and still no weight loss.  Due my personal history with eating disorders I was always advised not to track calories. The nutritionist i worked with while running a long time ago always said to eat more calories and to choose whole milk, and always get things like cheese with full fat, ect. I wasnt trying to gain weight but she said it was better for you.  I also was advised to never get the fake sugar and lots of other tips for health that im not sure are still accurate. But anyways the last time I calorie counted was over a decade ago. So today after calorie counting i was so surprised. I always considered my breakfeast light and within 2 hours im starving but like 650 calories is over a 3rd of my caloroes for the day. Is this really the amount i should be eating to loose weight??

One day, she pulled me aside and said “You’ve been taking more than your allotted 60 minutes for lunch. It’s not setting the right tone.” Mind you, I usually ate at my desk and just took a walk afterward.

Fine. From that day forward, I clocked out and back in to the exact second. If I logged out at 12:04:37, I logged back in at 1:04:37. I even added a note each time: “60 min per Diane’s policy.”

Then I started tracking everything: coffee breaks, late meetings, random chit-chat down to the minute. It looked ridiculous on the log, but I was just “being accurate.”

After two weeks, Diane told me I was “being a bit much.” I told her I was just following the policy she wanted.

Think about how a specific brand of coffee, a particular architectural style in your city, or even just a recurring dream can hint at a much richer, more complex backstory than you initially realise.

It's not about conspiracy theories,necessarily,but more about appreciating the depth and potential meaning woven into our everyday lives. Someone described it as urban fantasy meets historical fiction, but rather of mythical creatures, you're dealing with unacknowledged histories and forgotten connections. It encourages you to look beyond the surface and ask, ""What's the story *behind* the story?""

Has anyone else encountered this idea? I'm curious to hear if you've found any examples of LayerLore in your own experiences or if you have any thoughts on where this kind of thinking might lead. I'm also interested if anyone uses this as a writing/worldbuilding prompt.

Need tips on weight gaining diet!,"**NOT VEGAN ANYMORE:** After 3 years being a vegan (almost fruitarian last year and a half), this year I started eating 2 eggs a day, and as from today I started eating organs too (liver, heart, kidney).   
  
**CONTEXT:** The last couple of weeks I have been having horrible abdominal pain after a few days of over eating. Anything I ate crushed my stomach, so I have been eating very little. After searching lots of information I concluded I have SIBO caused by overeating and diet changes (I started eating oats every day for the last 2 months). I am starting to feel much better after eating many light meals a day, instead of 3 very big ones with no snacks in between as I accustomed to. Apple Cider Vinegar has been tremendously helpful too (now drinking a teaspoon 3 times a day). Also eating lots of garlic, cloves, ginger and oregano for their antibacterial properties.  
I live in a place with very poor access to health, plus I have had way too many bad experiences with doctors in the past.  
Eating such high quantities of fruit, rice, potatoes and pumpkin gave me high blood sugar symptoms, so that is one of the reasons to change my diet too.  
  
**+++ WEIGHT +++**  
Today I weighed myself after a very long time, and I am 47.2kg at 175cm height. According to BMI, I should be 56.8kg.   
30 year-old male.

**LIFESTYLE:** I do light calisthenics at home every day, and play tennis twice a week and beach tennis twice a week too. I am a 20 year recovering sedentary person, trying to do excercises throughout the whole day in small reps. Due to my recent stomach problems I am unable to do much home excercise as movement upsets my stomach, plus the weight lost and bad diet made me feel exhausted all the time.

**WHAT I NEED**  
I just need tips on how to gain weight. I have been looking at posts from other people and they recommend cheese, cream, milk, butter, grease and stuff like that.   
I would like to eat only eggs and organs as animal based foods, but I am open to reasonable suggestions. I just do not wish to eat meat/fish or dairy. I could consider bivalve mollusks.  
I will avoid processed foods, oils and anything that would need a fridge since I do not own one. I also do not consume sugar, gluten, alcohol, coffee or smoke anything at all.  
I can't do legumes yet because of my upset stomach, and I would like to avoid them in general.

What is this religion?,"I enjoy researching more fringe groups, and I randomly stumbled across this American religious group called the Seth Center. Their website is Sethcenter.com . It was started by a woman named Jane Roberts in the 1960s, who believed she channeled the spirit of a deity named Seth through an ouija board. Now this has grown into a whole organization dedicated to the teachings of ‘Seth’ and Roberts’ books. People still study her books and meet up in person and online to study Seth weekly.

I understand many new age religions are harmless forms of experimentation with spirituality, but a couple of things have raised an eyebrow for me. First, I cannot find any negative reviews or criticism of this group, absolutely anywhere. No matter how beautiful or pro-social a religious practice, there are always going to be people who share some disgruntlement or negative experience, even if it’s that the coffee served in their church’s lobby was too cold. Every YouTube video, every book review, every comment on forums I read about the Seth Center is not only positive, but overwhelmingly so. I guess I just find this at odds with basic human behavior on the internet. 

Second, I find it interesting that Seth material is generally not free to access. Some people have uploaded audiobooks of Jane Roberts’ for free on YouTube, but the Seth Center website seems to require paid membership or a book purchase for access to any of their information. I also don’t believe they operate as a 501(c). Most religions I am familiar with consider it a public service to provide free access to the information about their beliefs. 

Have any of y’all had experience with this group? Any good or bad experiences? I just find it so strange and curious. Maybe I just don’t understand what I’m looking at. ",4,1748457702.0,religion,2,1.0,False

My dream city: minimum 250k population, great location 1B1B 700+ sq ft apartment walking distance to best part of town - food, bars, coffee shops, etc. w/ rent under $2000.

Should have major airport with international flights, ideally Midwest or eastern US, tolerant of conservative/liberal cities, just needs to be fairly low crime since I have a lot of outdoor gear that’s not easily insured.

CA and NY are out based on taxes and having a large dog. DC is out, but was under serious consideration.

I lived in Charlotte, NC in the past and it was pretty nice but really missing the outdoor lifestyle aspect I’m looking for. I’d like something with comparable or better job environment in Tech.

Current list:

1. Dallas, TX - affordable, tax advantages, great airport, close to east coast but still totally new experience for me, good dating scene, decent job prospects, worst part is probably heat for my large dog
2. Denver, CO - gives me all of the outdoors stuff nearby, good tech scene, but a bit less convenient to east coast and would be more expensive when I go to buy a house
3. Austin, TX - probably the best all around fit, but pricy and the airport is not as good as DFW, same issue with heat for dog
4. Boulder, CO - seems similar to Austin:Dallas, but in comparison to Denver

I stepped back, rarely posting, responding, and moved back to mostly playing games.

Facebook is jammed with ads, with fake stories and videos, and if you complain, you are punished.

You can't play a game without ads disrupting every other move.

I know Zuck has sold his soul, or what was left of it, to Trump, and perhaps he'll sell FB to a human being who will make it pleasant.

But I suspect it's spiraling down to disfunction

1kxoqqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kxoqqc/one_mike_to_read_them_all_advance_review_of_the/,One Mike to Read Them All: Advance review of “The Potency of Ungovernable Impulses” by Malka Ann Older,"It’s been rainy and unseasonably cold here, so this was the perfect time to return to Giant (better known as Jupiter) and the latest investigation of Mossa & Pleiti. Cozy as always, heartwarming as always, but it was a journey to get there.

The story opens with Mossa’s perspective, debating going to see Pleiti and ultimately deciding not to. Cut to Pleiti; she’s fretting over their relationship, and concerned at the growing distance she perceives between them. Her ruminations are interrupted when an old friend from their university days - Petanj - knocks on her door. Another mutual friend - Villette, Petanj’s cousin - is also in academia, at a university on the far side of Giant, and up for a donship despite her youth. Yet someone is running a smear campaign, accusing Villette of that ultimate academic sin, plagiarism. Villette has heard of Pleiti’s work with Mossa and asks her to come and see who is working against Villette. Pleiti agrees, but makes no promises for Mossa. Which is just as well; Mossa is sunk into a deep depression, and tells Pleiti to leave her alone. So Pleiti goes off to do the investigation on her own.

Malka Older’s academic background shows through clearly. Pleiti finds herself at a distant university with an enormous chip on its collective shoulder about not being Pleiti’s older, prestigious university. She also finds herself, a Classicist, interacting mostly with Modernist scholars, so there’s academic contempt and snobbery and chips on shoulders there as well. But she does her best to find the source of the smear campaign, all the while missing Mossa and feeling like Mossa should be there.

On this, Pleiti and I are of one mind.

Mossa does show up eventually, of course, and emotions between them are fraught. But immediately the book felt more balanced. I’m quite certain this was a deliberate choice on the author’s part; the series needs the dynamic between the two of them.

The actual *mystery* of this cozy mystery was probably the least satisfying of the three Mossa & Pleiti books published thus far; it felt like mostly noise in the background while Mossa & Pleiti worked things out. The reveal was fine, but didn’t really have much emotional weight for me. Luckily the interpersonal stuff did, which makes this an easy 4 stars.

Comes out on 10 June. Have a cup of coffee/tea/cocoa on standby.

The apartment was still.

B sat alone on the couch, the weight of silence pressing into her shoulders like a second spine. Her tea had gone cold, untouched. Beside her, folded neatly but too close, was the napkin.

The number was written in A’s handwriting.

No—Mr. A.

She didn’t remember when the name changed. She only knew that’s what he had become, and somehow, what he had always been. That name fit him now. It didn’t feel new. It felt inevitable.

She picked up the napkin.

“Be honest,” she whispered, though no one was listening. “Be real.”

Then, quieter: “But… be what?”

She didn’t call. She didn’t throw it away either.

Just sat, still in yesterday’s clothes, while the room reeked of unfinished sentences and half-spoken needs.

⸻

The door opened.

“Coffee, cream, cereal, cookies. Classic comforts. Coming through.”

C’s voice was too cheerful, his arms full of plastic bags. He tossed keys into the bowl like they didn’t deserve better.

B didn’t move.

“Cold shoulders. Classic,” he muttered, setting groceries down.

“You left,” she said.

“Collected essentials. Created space. Calmed down.”

He moved around the kitchen like a performance. Everything he touched crinkled. Too loud. Too rehearsed.

“Commitment, B. Clarity. Couplehood,” he said, turning to face her.

“Control,” she replied without looking up.

He stiffened.

“Correction. Communication,” he snapped. Then, gentler, “Can’t keep colliding with chaos. Can’t keep chasing shadows.”

He stepped closer.

“Choose. Cut the cord or come close again. Clean slate.”

B looked up. Her eyes didn’t blink.

“You talk like there’s only one page to turn.”

“Clarity is clean. Complicated is corrupt.”

She closed her eyes. The groceries sat still.

“I need…” Her voice cracked. She changed course. “Break.”

C didn’t respond. Just stood there, jaw tight. Then he walked past her, into the bedroom. The door clicked closed behind him. Not slammed. Just… definite.

⸻

She sat there longer than she meant to.

The silence came back, heavier than before. It didn’t care what groceries had been bought. It only knew how to settle in the places words didn’t touch.

She reached for her notebook. Not to write him a letter. Not even to think about Mr. A. Just… to see if she could still find herself in pages.

She flipped past cluttered notes, receipts pressed between half-formed thoughts.

Then she wrote:

Broken.
Blamed.
Bruised.
Bare.
But… breathing.

She underlined the last one. The line wavered slightly.

Then she added one more.

Brave?

The question mark sat there, aching in its honesty.

She stared at the word. The pen trembled. For once, she didn’t try to fix the shape of the letters. She just let them be what they were—raw, imperfect, present.

And for the first time that day, she didn’t feel like disappearing.

⸻

There was a knock.

Not rushed. Not dramatic. Just… steady.

She opened the door.

Mr. A stood there. Taller. Different. A jacket she didn’t recognize hugged his shoulders—black, with a hint of red inside the lining. His posture was clean. Calm.

He held a notebook under his arm.

“Afternoon,” he said.

“You came back,” she replied, surprised at how natural it felt to say back, as if he’d belonged here all along.

“I said I was available,” he smiled. “Always aiming for authenticity.”

She didn’t smile. But she didn’t close the door either.

“I’ve been working,” he said, lifting the notebook. “On a company. Kind of. Still early. But I think it’s real.”

“You’re not… joking?”

“Not this time.”

He handed her the notebook.

“I want to build something,” he said. “Something solid. Something strange, maybe, but real. And I want you in it. You don’t have to say yes. I just want you to think about it.”

She took the notebook. Their fingers touched—too brief to be called a moment, too heavy to forget.

“I’ll think,” she said.

“That’s all I ask.”

He paused at the stairs.

“I left something downstairs,” he said, not looking back. “Just ideas. Scribbles. Maybe a beginning.”

Then he was gone.

⸻

She didn’t go back inside. Not yet.

She walked to the stairwell, still holding the notebook to her chest. The weight of it wasn’t heavy, but it was deep.

The mailroom light flickered.

Box 203.

Inside was a manila folder addressed in clean handwriting:

To: B
From: Mr. A

She opened it there in the hallway, her breath slowing as she read.

Inside: mock-ups, budget ideas, slogans crossed out and rewritten. A rough logo. Notes in the margins. Doodles. Scribbled reminders about meetings that hadn’t been scheduled yet.

And at the top:

B is for Balance: A Foundation Built Together

On the last page, in curling script:

If you want more, meet me at Aroma Alley. No pressure. Just purpose.

She stared at the letter.

She didn’t smile.

But she didn’t close the folder either.

I like the amount of body I get from this grinder and I’m concerned that the Atom might provide less of this, and more bright notes.

1kxoh8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kxoh8r/boyfriend_uses_my_bed_as_his_desk_for_work_and/,Boyfriend uses my bed as his desk for work and gaming,"

I have been living with my boyfriend for nearly 2 years. I am frustrated over how our bed is used as a shared space. I am looking for ways to communicate my side to him without making him feel overly defensive and shut down.

At first, we lived in a very small apartment that just had a very small bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, so there was no room in the apartment for a couch or desk. The bed served as our ""couch"" to watch tv and relax together and my boyfriend used it as a desk to work from home. I didn't like all of the traffic on the bed but we didn't have much of a choice due to the lack of space.

Recently, we moved out into a larger apartment with a living room, 2 bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, and dining room. It's not completely furnished but we have the basics (dining table with chairs, couch, coffee table, tv, entertainment system). My plan was to use the second bedroom as an office/game room but it isn't furnished yet. I'm in the process of searching for desks and other office furniture. 

Since we've moved, my boyfriend still spends alot of his time in bed. He works from home full-time and is usually laying in bed with his 2 laptops. He has a work laptop and will play music on his personal laptop during work hours. When he's off from work, he lays in bed playing video games or watching shows/movies on his personal laptop. He gets up to go to the bathroom, go to the kitchen to cook, take out the trash, or sweep the floors but spends most of his time in bed. 

I asked him if he would ever sit at the dining table with his laptop and he said he doesn't see the point in that and it doesn't matter where he works. He will occasionally move his setup out to the couch if I need to nap after my physical therapy appointments but otherwise he lays sprawled out in bed with the laptops. 

When I look at desk listings for the office on FB marketplace, I ask him if he would ever be open to sitting at a desk with his laptops. He says that he will only work/game laying in bed and there is no point in buying a desk because he won't use it. 

My issue with this is that I don't think this is a healthy habit to be forming for multiple reasons. He frequently takes naps during the day and I asked him why. He said he struggles to sleep at night and feels tired during the day. I told him that when he spends most of his waking hours in bed, that will negatively affect his sleep. He still is not receptive to changing this habit and doesn't believe it is contributing to his poor sleep quality. 

Also, I notice that our comforter and sheets get dirty faster when they are constantly being used. The dust from his laptops also keeps getting on the comforter and blanket, which makes feel uncomfortable. I don't believe it is fair that I don't feel comfortable laying down after long stressful days at work - especially considering the fact that I have chronic pain. I also feel like our bedroom looks messy and chaotic when his laptops are strewn across the bed and there is a jungle of cords on the floor and computer accessories (cooling platforms, mousepads) stacked on the windowsill.  I have an idea in my head of how I want our bedroom to look but feel upset that it will never live up to my expectation due to how he manages his space.

I've asked him a few times if he could at least keep his laptops on his side of the bed and leave my side of the bed alone. He will usually say ok begrudgingly and then later forget and move his laptop back to my side of the bed when I leave the room. When I go to move his laptop back to his side he will say that I have OCD and it's not normal for me to be so upset by something so small.

Also when his friend visits the apartment, they will lay on our bed. I wish the living room would be used as a common area when friends come over and not the bed.

We also have a cat who frequently chews his cords. He's had to buy about 6 mouses in the past few months because our cat keeps biting them. If his cords were stored away in a desk drawer when they're not in use as opposed to laying out in the open they wouldn't be getting chewed. 

Overall, in my ideal scenario the bed would only be reserved for sleeping and relaxing and we would have a separate space relegated for work/recreation. I would prefer if we could at least reach a compromise where he uses his laptops either in the living or the dining room, since he refuses to sit at a desk. When I try to communicate this to him, he usually says I'm being rude and unfair then shuts down and doesn't want to speak to me for a while. I've considered the possibility that he is depressed, so I asked him if he would be open to seeing a therapist. He said yes but to my knowledge has not made an effort into searching for a therapist. I'm not sure how to proceed in communicating my needs effectively and would appreciate any suggestions. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that we are both autistic. When my boyfriend verbally shuts down during discussions, I suspect it's because he feels overwhelmed and not a manipulation tactic. I wanted to note this to distinguish his behavior from allistic stonewalling. ",2,1748456650.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I'll spare you the long post and get straight to the facts:

* 30 years old, male, UK born and raised 🇬🇧
* Full time electronics product tester (it's a rad job) 🧑‍💻
* PC / Steam Deck / Switch gamer🎮
* Travelled to a few countries (USA, Japan, Czech Republic) ✈️
* Has 2 tattoos 😎
* Met 3 people from Reddit IRL 😁
* Laid back and easy to talk to - uses emojis a lot (can you tell?)

**WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR**

I'm very social and love to text (or better yet, voice call!) - ideally I'd like to make some new friends who I can talk with on the daily, if you also want to play games that'll be neat too! 

I love to screen share, so watching me play games or watching shows / movies / YouTube together is also on the cards, even if that means just sitting in a call together 😁

If you're based in the UK, big bonus points - you should deffo message, otherwise I'm happy to talk to anyone from anywhere. I'd like to have a little back and forth on Reddit first before possibly moving to another platform (i.e Discord) 

Direct messages are **preferred**, but instant chat requests are OK too! How about a little intro, or tell me something funny to get the conversation started! 

I'll also include this little [vocaroo recording](https://voca.ro/1lvSMfWLU7Or) for the folk who like that? 😅",1,1748456579.0,R4R30Plus,1,1.0,False
