I’m not looking for anything rushed just someone to talk to regularly, someone who gets that some days are sunshine and some days are low-battery mode. I have my mood swings, but I try to handle them with coffee, music, and the occasional deep dive into random topics (space, deep sea, psychology, or why we all text “haha” when nothing’s funny).

If you’re someone who enjoys easy, thoughtful chats the kind that can drift from memes to meaning without trying too hard we’ll probably get along.

[friendship],"***Hi lovely to meet you internet stranger !*** I'm a 20 year old from South Africa hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am, mainly a buddy to text about everything and nothing and the glorious nonsense in between , If that sounds like you then keep reading :)

**Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click :**  
I’m a 20 year old, I have ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading: *Het gouden ei* by Tim Krabbé), journaling, baking, crafting. I love making a million playlists for every mood or vibe and end up never listening to them again (and then hoarding them on my iPod). I don’t enjoy watching movies but am into series (currently: *Lang Leve de Liefde*, *KOTH*). I love going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I like playing online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes, reading Wikipedia articles and just chilling in the sun doing whatever. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. I am up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click!

**Things to expect if we become friends**  
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)  
• Random song recommendations  
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day  
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

**Disclaimer**  
DON’T JUST SEND ME HI / HELLO / HEY / HOW ARE YOU? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a little intro about yourself! (pretty please) <3",1,1760458298.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False
1o6jssn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o6jssn/went_on_a_first_date_and_the_guy_was_being_too/,Went on a first date and the guy was being too touchy.,"I (19F) met this guy (22M) from my university, we talked once, and then he asked if we could grab coffee and chat since we’re both internationals from the same country. I said yes, but it ended up feeling more like a date; we went to a fancy restaurant and everything.

While we were walking, he’d randomly pull me aside “away from the cars,” even when the street was empty or the cars were on the other side. I also noticed he was being kind of touchy, and when we said goodbye, he went straight in for a hug.

Normally, I wouldn’t mind that, I’m a pretty touchy person myself and I hug my friends all the time. But since we’re both from a country with strong religious conservatism, it felt weird. The fact that we both know this kind of interaction would be considered unacceptable back home made it feel even more awkward.

I don’t know if he’s just not used to interacting with girls and maybe got a bit excited, or if it actually meant something more. I’m just confused, how should I act around him now?

TL;DR:
Went out with a guy from my uni from my home country. It felt like a date and he was a bit touchy, which felt weird because back home that would be considered “haram”. Not sure if it meant something or if he was just being friendly.

I have done so much to change up my lifestyle, quit coffee, changed my diet, started doing walks every single day, sleeping on a wedge pillow now. The only bad habit I kept going with was smoking marijuana, I have smoked it since I was 15 every single day. Yesterday though I noticed I was actually feeling good until the moment I sat down and smoked, then it was an insta attack that wouldn't go away until late evening maybe even middle of the night. In that moment I realized the smoke is doing it to me, I got fed up and decided I don't actually need to smoke anymore; almost 24 hours now and I feel a lot better again. Do yourself a huge favor and stop trying to hold on to your vices, there are alternatives out there for some of this stuff like plant based non caffeine coffee for example. Find some kind of content and excitement in your new life and stop holding on to the past, if quitting these things will make us feel better then it's 100% just in our heads and we don't need it. Try to distract yourself for a couple days and you'll find those withdrawal feelings go away.

1o6jqyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1o6jqyk/my_heart_just_cant_leave_her_but_my_brain_cant/,My heart just can't leave her but my brain can't take it anymore,"My(25m) gf(28f) has BPD. We were together for about a year and a half, broke up earlier this year and and then got back together several months later. We've been together again for several months now, and at first it seemed like such a good idea, it felt so good to be back with her and I felt like I saved myself from an awful mistake of missing out on her for the rest of my life. However, we very quickly fell into our old habits from right before we broke up, and we easily spend more time fighting and being mad at each other.

She tells me that she loves me and I'm the only person she could see herself spending her life with, but always has so many things to complain about me and things she thinks ""I need to work on"". We can never just enjoy our time together. 

  
It started going really down hill a few weeks ago. I stayed the night at her house which I don't do often for reasons, mostly because I have issues sleeping there. We had sex which we didn't do for awhile, and it was really nice, but when we were finished she just said ""I have to go to sleep now"" and turns off the lights and tv and rolls over and goes to sleep (in a sleeping position, not a cuddling position). I said I'm not tired can I keep watching TV? She says no. Okay then, I just go on my phone and get up occasionally to smoke or go to the bathroom tip toeing around to not disturb her. Every little tiny noise I make she is shushing me and telling me to be quiet (not nicely), and grunting/moaning if I even adjust slightly or move my arms around. Whatever, sometimes we're a little grouchy or something, I get it. I just brush it off and go to sleep. Next day I'm half awake driving her to work, not too bothered by the events of last night but felt like it should be discussed in a healthy relationship. She asks me ""Whats wrong?"" and I tell her, I say ""Why were you mean to me last night?"" and instead of just saying ""I'm sorry I wasn't trying to be mean"" she says everything but that. ""You were so loud last night! I have to sleep! You can't keep me up when I have to work!"" etc. etc. 

  
We got into a big fight that night because I felt I was just asking for the bare minimum in a relationship, ya know, not being mean to the other person. I told her how it felt like I was getting reprimanded all night by my parents, not like I was talking to someone who's in love with me. She doesn't say much and then comes back with ""Maybe we aren't the best for eachother"" and I had a moment of weakness where I break down because I'm just asking her to talk nicely to me and shes saying ""I can't do that, sorry, I'd rather breakup that talk to yo nicely"". After that, she flips like a switch and apologizes and acts nice and sweet and everything is fine. It felt like she didn't actually want to break up, but was playing with my emotions or testing me to see if I wanted to break up with her.

  
Ever since then, it's like she is trying to get the jump on being the victim before I can (even though I'm not trying to). For example, we were at an event together that was about 1hr30min away from our house. When we get ready to leave, she says ""Hey want to go to \[place that is additional 30 minutes out of the way\]"" and I said ""Not really to be honest It's getting late and I'm pretty tired and it will be a lot of driving"" and she immediately breaks down ""You don't ever want to do anything I want to do! You don't love me! If you did you would be excited to take me there!"" Now I wasn't even completely against going to the place, I would have preferred to go home, but was also open to go to the place. I was just trying to communicate how I was feeling about it, and have a mature adult conversation about the plans for the rest of the night, but her reaction made that impossible.

Now the next day we got into an argument again. I will be honest, sometimes when we are fighting I get a little emotional. It's not uncommon for us to both get emotional, and when she is ripping into me sometimes I cry a lot, and don't handle my emotions as I should. I would never ever hurt her, or hurt anybody. I'm not violent. I have never gotten into a physical altercation in my entire life. I have never in my life struck somebody with intent to cause harm. I would never ever think about hurting someone I care about as much as this person, and I don't think my subconscious mind is capable of doing it for me either. I have done two things that she considers aggressive though in the heat of argument, one time I took a coffee cup in my hand and threw it on the ground (not directed at her and it did not break) and one time I was driving in the car as she was saying ""Fuck you, you don't care about me, you don't love me, fuck you"", I slammed on the gas pedal. Are these appropriate ways to handle my emotions? Not at all, and I'm not proud of my actions. But it does feel like she is weaponizing my emotions against me, and now she is saying that she is scared of me, scared to be around me, that I'm going to hurt her. I told her maybe we should just break up then, because if you are scared of me, I don't see how this is going to work out and you should not feel like you are forced to be with someone who you are scared of. She says that we need couples counseling, I tell her that I do not want to do that. I ask her if there is anything else we can do to save this, and she gives me the ultimatum either couples counseling or we break up. I tell her I do not want to do couples counseling and she says okay guess we're broken up. After that I asked very nicely and kindly to leave my house, she refused and just laid in the bed ignoring me not saying. I took a walk outside, come back in and just try to clear my mind and let her lay in bed while I play some video games. She manipulates me into letting her stay and coming back into bed and cuddling with her. It felt like we were still done, but I love her so much and I couldn't hold her in my arms without crying thinking about how I'm not going to be able to do that again.

The next morning I ask her if we can talk again in a few days. She says yes and leaves. I focus on my schoolwork and processing my feelings. A couples days later I was about to reach out to her, but she beats me to it. Sending me paragraph after paragraph, blowing my phone up with calls (that I ignore because she is clearly in a very emotional state), talking about how I'm an awful person because I am ghosting her and triggering her trauma. I nicely said ""I'm sorry I wasn't ghosting you I was planning to reach out, I have just been focusing on my schoolwork and processing things"". She was still very emotional and intense with her responses, but scheduled a time to meet in a couple more days.

Before I thought the best course of action was to break up, but when I go over to talk to her, I just can't do it. Just the thought of not being able to see her face anymore and not being able to give her a hug and tell her I love breaks my heart. She tells me if I loved her, I would go to therapy with her. And that she agrees we aren't in a good spot but she loves me enough to try anything. Whenever I tell her I don't want to do couples therapy, she asks me ""Why don't you love me enough to go to therapy?"" I don't know how to respond to that.

  
I don't want to go to therapy because I feel like it's embarrassing. Or at least that was my original feeling about it. I felt like I am 25 years old, not married and don't have children. I love this woman and want to spend the rest of my life with her, but I don't feel like couples counseling is the place for me to be. Seeing her face and hearing her voice say she loves me enough to go to therapy with her makes me forget about that, and I agreed to try therapy. I agreed to use my insurance, and find a therapist and get back to her with that information. I feel like an idiot, because I don't feel like therapy is going to work. I feel like she will either claim the therapist doesn't respect her point of view, or she will weaponize the therapist against me.

I'm supposed to reach out to her today with some information about therapists, but feel like I should just say ""I'm sorry, but I have decided I can't do couples counseling"". ",1,1760458174.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1o6jqj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6jqj8/trying_to_hold_boundaries_with_parents_as_my/,Trying to hold boundaries with parents as my grandma is dying,"Longtime lurker, first time poster here. I (28F) am an only child. My dad is the N and my mom the E. I ran away from home as a teenager and have been pretty distant with my family since then, putting up with bare minimum holiday visits and not rocking the boat. Sometimes I’ll get coffee or lunch with my mother, who I still care for and wish I could have a better relationship with. Her mother, my grandmother, is a fantastic human being. I spent a lot of time with her as a child, and we were best friends. She had a stroke a few months ago and has been saying that she’s going to die this year.

When she had her stroke, my mom had my NDad inform me over text. Never missing a chance to guilt trip, he texted me that my grandma was not doing well, I should see her soon, he gives her a week to live, and my mom could use a shoulder to cry on. He added “Btw... do NOT  mention that I said anything to you. Let's just leave it to your thoughtfulness 🙄” (he actually used this emoji three times while informing me of my grandma’s impending death). When I called him out on his tone, he said “sorry, but FUCK YOU and your lame lifestyle. I am DONE with you” and the classic “no child had a better life than you” line. I get a text from my grieving mother about my dad and I arguing, saying that she couldn’t bear to tell me and asked my dad to. It was in that moment I realized the depths of this man’s narcissism. That he wanted me to play this game where he hadn’t told me, even though she literally asked him to. That he took this opportunity to swing at me, and then turned around to cry to his wife who was processing the fact that her mother was dying, and make it about him. I ended up blocking his number for causing such ridiculous drama in a crisis.

I got lunch with my mother about a month ago to talk to her about this, because my birthday was coming up. I showed her all the things he said, and thought we were on the same page. I said I would consider unblocking him but he is not to text me about family emergencies. I did not actually unblock his number. Which was great, because yesterday as I’m in the car on my way home from a trip out of town, I get a text from my mother asking if I had unblocked him. She says she had him text me because my grandma was in the hospital. I said I thought we went over this boundary. She said that she understood where I was coming from but did not necessarily agree. I told her that boundaries are not something you get to disagree about, they are something you can choose to respect or not respect. I told her that it is their loss if they can’t respect my boundaries. This struck a nerve and the entire conversation began to revolve around the “your loss” thing. She said she won’t tell me anything about my grandma anymore so that “we aren’t crossing any boundaries”. The whole text sounded like my father speaking through her. I told her that she was willfully misunderstanding me because she did not like what I said, and that her updating me about my grandma was not a problem. She left me on read.

This whole experience just feels like a nightmare. Losing my favorite relative while having to navigate old trauma that I felt I had put behind me. Now I feel iced out of any updates because my own damn boundaries have backfired. There is no winning with these fucking people, and it feels so awful to be grieving every family relationship at once in its own way. I don’t know if this is a vent post or an advice post, I just needed to put it out there in a place where maybe someone would understand.",1,1760458147.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1o6jpg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProStudying/comments/1o6jpg1/20_top_tips_for_writing_an_essay_in_a_hurry/,20 Top Tips for Writing an Essay in a Hurry,"# 1. Adopt the right mindset

Before you start writing, it’s crucial to get yourself into the right mindset. You may be experiencing feelings of panic, feeling as though you don’t have enough time and you can’t do it. You may feel defeated before you’ve even begun. To be successful, however, you will need to banish these negative feelings. It’s vital to be positive, to try to relish the challenge, and to adopt a ‘can-do’ attitude. If it helps, imagine it’s a battle that you’re going to win. Give yourself a pep talk, and keep the end goal in mind: you’re going to do a great job and impress your teacher. You’re going to prove to yourself that you can take on this challenge, enjoy it, and write an essay in record time. Take a deep breath, remain calm, and start to attack the work systematically and logically.

# 2. Switch off your phone and social networks

The last thing you need when you only have a couple of hours to write an essay is to get distracted by your phone or social networks, which have a habit of eating away at your time without you even realising. Procrastination isn’t an option at this late stage, so it’s time to ban yourself from your phone, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, iPlayer, YouTube, and anything else you think might distract you. Sit somewhere quiet and put a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. If it helps, install a full-screen text editor onto your computer, such as Darkroom, to force yourself to look at your essay and only your essay. You can also get browser apps that keep you off social networks for a time period of your choosing.

# 3. Type your essay rather than handwriting it

Most young people these days type faster than they write by hand, so unless you’ve been told that you must handwrite your essay, type it. This will make it much easier to edit what you’ve written and change things around, and you’ll be able to get more words in through typing quickly. It’s probably also going to be easier for your teacher to read a typed document than your handwriting, and you won’t suffer an achy arm that could slow you down, so that’s an added bonus.

# 4. Read the question carefully

When you’re in a rush, it can be easy to skim over the question and think you’ve understood it – only for you to realise, after writing most of the essay, that you got the wrong end of the stick and it’s too late to change it. This is particularly hazardous when you’re under pressure, because your brain has a tendency to see what it wants to see; it may tell you that the title is asking a question that you want to answer, while the reality might be subtly but crucially different. So, start by reading the question very carefully and ensuring you’ve completely understood what it’s asking you to do. If it helps, underline key instructional words in the title, such as “compare” or “analyse”. This forces your mind to focus on the right kind of task, so you write the essay with this in mind.

# 5. Get your books ready

Prepare your workspace by opening the books you’ll need to use on relevant pages, or putting Post-It notes in them to mark where relevant information is. This means you won’t have to keep wasting precious time hunting through books to find the information each time you need to refer to it.

# 6. Sum up your argument in a sentence

To get yourself thinking clearly about what you’re going to be writing, see if you can sum up what your argument is going to be in a single sentence – a bit like an ‘elevator pitch’. If you can’t do this, the chances are that you don’t quite know what you want to say, with the result that you may end up waffling in your essay, thereby wasting valuable time. It’s important to set out with a clear idea of what your argument is, because then everything you write subsequently will be working towards the goal of getting this particular argument across. Of course, don’t spend too long on this and end up with not enough time to write the actual essay!

# 7. Write your notes directly into the document

When you’re in a hurry, your notes can double up as an essay plan, killing two birds with one stone. Start by typing your essay notes directly into the document you’ve created for your essay. This could be bullet points or one-sentence summaries of what you want to write in each paragraph. For each point, also include a line or two on what evidence you’re going to use in support. Once you’ve done this, organise the notes into a sensible structure by dragging and dropping paragraphs into an order you think works. This becomes your detailed essay plan.

# 8. Then rewrite your notes into an essay with an argument

You now have the outline of your essay in note form. You can now turn your notes into an essay by rewriting them into academic prose, complete with ‘filler’ sentences that glue it all together and help build your argument.

# 9. Save the introduction and conclusion for last

Perhaps surprisingly, the introduction and conclusion of an essay are often the hardest bits to write. So, save these for last. By the time you’ve written the body of the essay, the task of writing the introduction and a summarising conclusion should be much easier, as you’ll already have spent plenty of time on your argument and you’ll be very familiar with it.

# 10. Do the references as you go along

If you’re required to add references and a bibliography to your essay, do these as you go along to save time. Each time you quote someone, add in a footnote saying where the quote is from, and at the same time, copy and paste the details of the book into a bibliography at the end of your document.

# 11. Proofread as you go along

Save time on proofreading by checking over each sentence or paragraph for spelling, grammar and typos as you write it. When you’ve finished writing, it’s still worth having a quick final read through your essay for a sense check and to ensure that it flows well – but this should take less time now that you’ve already checked for errors.

# 12. Don’t be tempted to copy and paste

The internet is full of resources that probably exactly match what you’re going to be writing about, and when you’re in a hurry, there can be a strong temptation to copy and paste useful paragraphs into your essay. Don’t ever do this! Plagiarism is not only immoral, but it also means that you won’t learn the topic in as much depth – and the whole point of writing an essay is to consolidate what you’ve learned and prepare you adequately for future exams. Teachers can use Google too, and if they suspect that you’ve stolen someone else’s work by copying and pasting something off the internet, all they need to do is type one of ‘your’ sentences in Google and they’ll instantly find where you’ve got it from. It’s normally easy to spot copied work, because the style will be different from the rest of the essay. It’s just not worth the risk, as you’ll lose your teacher’s trust and this will probably be reflected in the quality of the reference they give you for university.

# 13. Try not to over-quote

A common tactic by students pushed for time is to use too many quotes – or very long passages – from other people (scholars, sources and so on) to bolster the word count and reduce the amount of writing they actually have to do themselves. Try to avoid doing this if you can; it’s a transparent tactic and shows that you haven’t fully mastered the subject yourself, so you have to resort to hiding behind the words of others. The vast majority of the writing in the essay should be your own. Short quotes here and there, accompanied by your commentary on them, are a good thing; lots of long quotes that take up much of the essay, with little explanation from you, are not.

# 14. Keep your style concise

You’re not going to have time for long-winded sentences, so keep your written style as concise as possible. There’s nothing wrong with being short and to the point in your sentences, providing it adequately conveys what you want the essay to convey. Being economical with words will ensure that you express yourself clearly as well as saving you time, so it’s a good idea all round.

# 15. Try a change of scene

If you’re struggling to concentrate on writing your essay in your normal work space, a change of scene might be just what you need to focus your mind. If you normally work at home, try heading to the library or a local coffee shop to see if you can work any better there. If you’re distracted by noise at home, try some noise-cancelling headphones or simply put some music on.

# 16. Take a break (but only if you feel you need one)

It sounds counterintuitive when you’re pushed for time, but taking short breaks from time to time will stop you running out of energy and keep you focused. If you have two hours to write the essay, for instance, take a break for five minutes after you’ve worked for an hour. That said, if you’re really ‘in the zone’ and working efficiently, and you don’t feel you need a break, just work straight through and take advantage of your spate of productivity for as long as it lasts.

# 17. Don’t bother with the usual tricks

Many students try to trick their teacher into thinking that their essay is longer than it really is by widening the margins, selecting a bigger font and using wider line spacing. Your teacher will see straight through this, and it might irritate them – so don’t bother!

# 18. It’s OK to use Google for quick research

While Google is no substitute for reading what you’ve been told to read, it can be useful for quick definitions or getting to grips with something you’re struggling with at the last minute. Don’t rely on it, by any means, but if you’re writing your essay and haven’t quite understood something in class, a quick Google search should enable you to acquire the level of understanding you need.

# 19. Keep hydrated and fed

Make sure you drink plenty of water while you’re writing, as this will help you stay alert. You may also want to equip yourself with some snacks to keep you going, as this can make the process of writing an essay more bearable as well as maintaining your energy levels.

# 20. Reward yourself

Give yourself something to look forward to once you’ve finished the essay, as this will help to motivate you to complete it. It could be a chocolate bar, the promise of watching an episode of your favourite television show, or an evening out with friends – anything that will provide sufficient incentive to get your essay finished. You’ve worked intensively and have a great essay to show for it, so you deserve a reward!",1,1760458078.0,ProStudying,0,1.0,False

1o6jmzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1o6jmzw/femobook_a2_99_rechargeable_electric_grinder_with/,Femobook A2 - $99 Rechargeable Electric Grinder with Heptagonal Burrs.,"This seems, to me, to be a very good deal for the money, especially when you consider that this has a 38mm heptagonal, conical burr set that is very similar to that of the 1Zpresso Q-Manual and Q-Air, which are known to make good filter coffee as well as espresso. 

And this is $99, compared to $109 for Q-Manual (Q-Air is $69 with same burrs, lighter and has a plastic body). 

From what I’ve read/heard, Femobook is a Taiwanese operation that was started by some folks who originally worked for 1Zpresso, but then left to start Femobook. (The details are a bit nebulous, and I think it’s still up in the air as to whether the two companies are actually linked/associated.) And they have several other grinders that seem to have been very well received by enthusiasts. For example, the A68, a big conical burr plug-in countertop grinder, and the A4Z, which is similar to this A2, but more premium, with a 48mm high-clarity burr set which is very similar to that of the ZP6, which raises further questions as to whether the two operations are connected, but, I digress…

There aren’t a lot of reviews out on it, but I did come across a video made by a gentleman who does a disassembly and goes through the components with pretty good detail, which is appreciated (Coffee Gear Lab YouTube channel):

https://youtu.be/-GTWlgaDy9s?si=cIDXKViD4GVMmxTY

I know one of the most common, recurring posts we see on coffee forums is from folks who have discovered they like coffee, want to dive deeper into it, have realized that grinding fresh before brewing is hugely beneficial to the taste of Tthe coffee, and want to get a “good” grinder, but aren’t quite sure what to get. 

The most common recommendation these days is the Kingrinder K6. I haven’t tried one but Lance Hedrick said in a grinder comparison video a few years ago that it uses essentially the same burr set as the 1Zpresso K-Ultra, which we know is great. 

However, the idea of an electrified hand grinder that can sit on the countertop, taking up very little space, with no power cord to worry about, and operate, potentially, for weeks without needing to be recharged, is very compelling (Femobook claims this can grind for 80 standard pourovers or 20 espresso shots before needing recharged)! And, it uses standard 18650 size LiOn batteries, which are easily user-replaceable, widely available, and very cheap (like, 5 bucks a piece). 

It would be great to see a review between the Femobook A2, 1Zpresso Q/Q-Air, Kingrinder K6, and maybe one or two other grinders in that price range that are recommended here on a daily basis. And maybe a blind taste test as well. 

I guess the only downsides I can think of about this grinder is that the body is plastic, and some people may prefer the premium feel of a metal hand grinder. Furthermore, a lot of enthusiasts enjoy the ritual of grinding by hand for their coffee. And then, if you also do batch brew with something like a MoccaMaster, you’d need to grind 2-3x to get the approximately 70-75g needed for a full 1.2L pot. But that is also the case with the hand grinders this competes with, and I don’t think many people who are shopping grinders for batch brew are considering hand grinders. 

However, there’s also something to be said for the convenience and ease of use, of electric grinding. 

Anyway, I did see one or 2 of y’all who bought one of these, and I’d love to hear your opinions on it, and, especially, comparisons with other grinders you own, or have used. 

Heck, I’m very tempted to buy one just out of pure curiosity, and to test against my other grinders (X-Pro, Ode 1 with Gen 2 burrs, J-Ultra). 

We might need to start including this in our grinder recommendations, especially when someone’s wanting something in that magic $100 range, for pourover, espresso, or both.

A proposal to spread kindness worldwide,"Hey everyone! I’ve been thinking a lot about the world lately, especially in a time when so much of the news seems heavy and divisive. Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could come together globally to simply focus on kindness and empathy?

Here’s my proposal: A Global Compassion Day, a day where people around the world intentionally perform acts of kindness and show empathy towards one another. This could involve small, everyday gestures like paying for someone’s coffee, or larger-scale efforts like organizing community outreach events, donating to those in need, or even just checking in on a friend who might be going through a tough time.

# Why?

* To combat loneliness: Mental health is an increasingly important issue, and even small acts of kindness can significantly boost someone's well-being.
* To unite across differences: Compassion transcends borders, cultures, and backgrounds. This day could be a unifying force that brings people together.
* To foster a ripple effect: Kindness is contagious. When we see others do something good, we’re more likely to do the same.

# How?

* Maybe we can start by establishing a global date (perhaps a symbolic time, like the first Saturday of every month).
* Social media could play a big role in spreading the word, using hashtags like #GlobalCompassionDay or #SpreadKindness.
* Local communities could organize events, from charity drives to simple neighborhood cleanups, just to create opportunities for people to connect.

I’m just putting this out there as a thought, what do you all think? Is it something that could catch on? What would be the biggest hurdles to overcome to make it happen?

this is my attempt at community engagement, and my hope to combat the NIMBYs that are destroying our city.

over the last several years the city has been trying to amend a by law which will allow for more shops and retail in community neighborhoods. This is a pretty universally wanted change, which almost every other major city in the world already has. this could allow for bakeries and coffee shops, as well as convenience stores, mom and pop shops, tailoring shops, etc. 

these changes could drastically improve the cities walkability, community building, less reliance on cars and especially detach us from our reliance on major chains for our day to day. (imagine being able to walk to a bakery for fresh bread every Sunday)

however, this change has been met with heavy resistance from certain very vocal NIMBY groups pearl clutching at the thought that some people may walk past their houses to grab a coffee or linger on a patio reading the newspaper :O (they are already trying to whittle down the allowances to not allow food prepared on site or seating)

they may raise a point in not wanting weed shops or vape shops in their neighborhood but that should not stop those other changes from happening.

in addition, you can join in on a virtual meeting oct 30th at 10 am if you email the same address.

It turned into a good friendship where we used to talk quite often. I'd like to mention that back then I was really sick and on bed rest, so I didn't really have much going on. However, now that I finally have my life back and a job that keeps me busy my friend has been acting strangely demanding.

Although I check in every other day and am there for her when she needs me, she expects me to keep the conversation going continuously. For instance, if I miss even one of her text (nothing important) she would get upset about it. Recently, I told her I was going out with my colleagues and upon coming back told her that we went to XYZ coffee place you know normal friend stuff and then went to bed. She had sent me a VoiceNote asking how it went. I couldn't respond as next day I woke up and got buys with work stuff. This led to a huge issue as she sent me a text stating that I am not a good friend and I told her that I am there when she needs me, but people get busy at times, and I don't want to receive such msgs every time I fail to reply to a text within 12 hours. She told me she was really pissed at me and that if I had the time to tell her that I was going out with my colleagues then I certainly can have the time to text her back. I told her that I am there when she needs me but I can't chat all the time

One major detail is that my friend is unemployed, never held a job in her life and never plans to. So, could be that she doesn't understand how busy corporate life gets and it's not possible to have full conversations every other day. This friendship has started to feel like a task where if I miss one deadline hell comes crashing loose. don't have the bandwidth for dealing with such stuff when I have so much on my plate already. I have explained multiple times but as she can't relate, she never understands.

I now find myself in a situation to rethink this friendship. AITA for that?",1,1760457631.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

the night before she unexpectedly broke up with me, i dreamt i was an old man whose lover died. i rose up to heaven and desperately tried to cling to her, but she disappeared into smoke despite my best efforts to keep what i knew i couldn’t. i fell from the sky like icarus burned by the sun. i forgot i had had this dream until, several nights after my breakup, i checked my journal and found it.

i’ve had many dreams about her since then. mostly, they’ve just been making me feel terrible in the morning. recently, i found out that she’s already moved on to another man (despite her reasoning for our breakup being that she needed to work on her approach to romance, so she wouldn’t date anyone for a long time. i also happen to have been friends with the guy in question at one point), which has exacerbated my emotional injury quite a bit.

i dreamt about her again last night, but this time was different. it wasn’t just sadness for the sake of sadness. in this dream, i was able to speak to her again. we happened to be in the same place at the same time in this dream. it was terrifying and awkward, but we broke down the barrier and began to go back and forth like we used to.

i woke up and fell back asleep, which allowed some time skip in the dream. we were talking. i don’t know where we were. we might have been getting coffee several months down the line.

she told me that we cannot rekindle our romance because she cannot love me the way i love her. i love her a lot. i would have done literally anything for her—changing my career path to make more money to support her, straining my familial relationships because they disapproved of her, etc. she loves me a little bit—not even enough to go to therapy with me to work on things. for this reason, she said that i need to move on and find someone else.

i was about to argue. i love her so much that i can work with only being loved a little bit. it’s okay if she can’t love me the way i love her. i don’t care.

but she read my mind and said, “you cannot hang your whole life on a little bit of love, op.”

i thought of how i had wanted a family and kids with her. she once told me she wanted the same, but she had since changed her mind, and that’s that. if we rekindled our romance, i would still be hoping for a future that she would never be able to give me.

and with that realization, i woke up.

i’ve been hoping to rekindle our romance for seven weeks since she left me. even now that she’s dating someone new, there’s still been this part of me that hasn’t been able to shut the door.

but hearing those words from her mouth, even just in a dream, gave me so much clarity. for the first time in weeks, i woke up feeling at peace.

He told me, “Most soldiers don’t actually fight for freedom. They fight because it’s a job, or because they were drafted, or because they needed a way out.”

His point wasn’t to insult anyone in uniform. He respects soldiers deeply. What he was questioning was the narrative we keep repeating, that every war is about “defending our rights.”

He said the last time a war truly had anything to do with our rights was the Civil War. After that, it’s mostly been about geopolitics, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan, all conflicts where our “rights” weren’t really being threatened at home.

He made an interesting argument about World War II too. He said, “It wasn’t about defending American rights. The U.S. joined only after being attacked and having its global position threatened. Most people who enlisted did so out of duty, not because they thought Germany was coming for their freedoms.”

And honestly, he might have a point.  
 He even added, “If our military is supposed to be protecting our rights, then why have our freedoms been slowly eroding from within, more surveillance, censorship, police overreach, while our military power keeps growing?”

It’s not that he’s anti-military. He just believes patriotism and propaganda often get mixed up, and that real courage sometimes lies in questioning the stories we’ve been told to believe.

So, here’s his take, and now I’m curious:

The one that gets the collective eye-roll in every code review? Yeah, it's not some ivory tower nonsense. It's literally about code *survival*.

I’ve got a story that should make you panic-refactor your entire codebase tonight.

# Meet CreateWindow: The God Function That Sank a Ship

Back in the Windows 90s era, there was a function called `CreateWindow`. This thing decided it was going to be the *entire* operating system's overworked intern. We're talking:

* **HR:** Memory allocation
* **Legal:** Parameter parsing
* **Design:** Style management
* **Comms:** Message handling
* **Construction:** Building every UI element

It ballooned into a **5,000-line monolithic monster**. A true **god function** that was so bloated, so complex, the entire Windows dev team had to **HALT ALL FEATURE DEVELOPMENT for over a year** just to perform emergency surgery on it.

Let that sink in: Microsoft, the dominant OS, stopped because one function forgot how to say: **That's not my job.**

# You Don't Need a God Object. You Need a Vacation. 🏖️

The punchline? Your little helper class that also logs, parses, caches, *and* makes the coffee? **That's a future** `CreateWindow`.

We’re not being pedantic when we talk about SRP. We’re talking about escaping a crippling **Legacy Tax**. You’re paying it now, one confusing commit at a time.

# The Only Refactor Plan You Need:

1. **Fire the ""Office Hero"" Class:** Get rid of the class that has 80% of the methods. Seriously, give it the boot.
2. **Hire a Specialized Team:** Break that beast up into small, single-purpose classes (a `Logger`, a `Parser`, a `CacheService`).
3. **Pay the Design Debt Now:** A few hours of focused refactoring today is infinitely cheaper than a massive, team-slowing feature freeze later.

Because you either write code that **can be changed**, or you eventually just stop rewriting code that **can't.**

**P.S. Spill it:** What's the most offensively over-engineered, CreateWindow-esque class you've ever had the misfortune of maintaining?",1,1760457314.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

I’ve been doing dirty fasting for a while now, and I honestly love how flexible it is. I’m not strictly black coffee and water, I’ll throw in some heavy cream, maybe a little sugar, and sometimes even a zero-calorie energy drink when I’m really dragging. It’s been working for me, but I’m curious, how do you all approach it?

I’ve seen some mixed opinions online about dirty fasting, especially with the whole insulin spike thing. I’m not doing it for extreme weight loss but more for the mental clarity and energy boost, and so far, it seems to be working.

Anyone else here use some non-traditional fasting fuels (like bone broth, sugar-free gum, etc.) and still see progress? What’s your go-to dirty hack? Also, has anyone hit a wall with this method, or have you been able to keep seeing results long-term?

And today I thought that Jacobs would make an interesting choice since it's right into that sweet price spot. So I went with the Jacobs Lungo Classico that has an intensity of 6. 
The pods looks nice, but unfortunately, it seems they put all their effort into the pod design instead of what's inside of it. 
I'm not a Lungo fan because of the watery taste but when I do buy a Lungo, I usually use it to prepare a short and a half that I mix with milk foam that ends up in a nice Cappuccino like thingy. 
But the test I'm treating it right, just as it meant to be and in this case, a Lungo. It started promising but after about 3 seconds, only slightly colored water started coming out. As you can imagine, there was barely any foam and the color of the coffee was very light. And the taste was as worse as it can be. No flavor, no smell, no nothing.
Compared to this, the Lungo from Lidl is top class. At first I though it was a faulty pod, but nope, it was the same each time I tried it. Even though, while opening the pod, I found they were using a paper filter on the bottom, a cheaper version of the way Nespresso does it, but they at least tried! 
So that pretty much sums up my experience with Jacobs Lungo Classico.

My father and mother divorced in the late 60s. I don't place blame on either, they were never compatible. Although I will say you would have to be a special type of woman to put up with his shit... But more timeline: In 1987 I gave up on dad, He was the type of guy who was emotionally abusive. He had remarried, but his wife died of a totally treatable cancer in '86, and he lost his mind. He had two kids with her, about 5 and 10 years old. He won the malpractice case, and each kid got over $100K for the loss of their mother. I was 23 at the time, and offered to move back with the three of them to help with the household. This did not go well. And resulted in me leaving, for good. So fast forward, my grandmother died in 1995, father's mother. She had virtually no estate, a car that I got and sold to pay for college, and a few thousand bucks, under $4K.

So last week I mentioned I would be in the city my 1/2 siblings live in, and offered to meet for coffee. My sister meet with me, and I learned she thought grandmother hated her, her brother, father, and new step mother. Now, I know this was not true. Not even a little bit true. Gran didn't have a lot of respect for my father, but trust me, her lack of respect for her son was well deserved. Sis has an image of our father being a great man, a man of integrity, who was wronged by his mother and son (me).

Like I said, she and I haven't been in touch for 15 years (I just found out she has a couple of pre-teens) but I am concerned she is going to go through life thinking that grandmother hated her. I know this came from my father, like I said, emotionally abusive and controlling, but would it be best to just let sleeping dogs alone? Or is honesty required here? I just don't know what to do. What would YOU want if you were my sister? I'm afraid I might crack how she feels about my father, who obviously manipulated her.

It was a very cold  day and the night looked like it would be even better. I had never seen snow my whole life. And I wondered if the snow would be as cold as this fog embracing everything in its arms until the end of time. But I wasn't out for this fog, I would rather be in my room drinking my coffee. I had run out of coffee. But the marts near me didn't sell the one that I liked.


I could have taken the bus but I liked walking on the cold street. I couldn't make out other people's faces. I couldn't see what the vendor was selling at the opposite side of the road. 
All I could see was the lights of vehicles driving past me. ""Moonlight by the River"" was playing on my earphones. It was a very pleasant moment.


After a forty minutes walk, I finally reached the mart where I used to buy the coffee. "" We're out of that one "" said the lady at the counter. She recommended me some other but I didn't care much. I thought about walking a bit further to see if I could find it in any other marts but it was already quite dark. As much as I liked the night, I had to go. 

On my way back I took a different way. I seldomly saw anyone walk that path. Maybe because it was very near to the woods. But it didn't bother me. The night had gotten darker and the dog thicker. I could no longer make out what' was in front  of me. I turned on my  phone's flashlight.

""zzzZzzZzz"" 

""ZZZZzzzzzZZZ""

I heard a sound. Even if I was near the woods, it was winter. So not many insects that make that kind of sound are heard during winter. I remember hearing Cicadas making that sound during summer days. But it was neither summer  nor  day. The sound stopped for a while and continued again.


It wasn't like no insects made sound during winter. But I could only think of the cicadas. I could only remember the hot summer days. I could hear the steady flow of cold water. I could feel how cold my legs were when I put then in the water. The soft silhouette made by the trees. The  red dragon flies flying. I never liked summer but I liked the things that came with summer. 

The sound stopped with I reached the main road. Now it was silence. It was quite an eerie moment not hearing anything while standing under the streetlights looking at the white for engulf each and every bit. How dearly I wished to drink a sip of coffee.

Here’s the simple breakdown from what’s been tested, studied, and shared by real people who track their performance.

# 🥦 1. Eat Light, Not Empty

A heavy meal pushes blood to digestion, not your pelvis.  
Going in stuffed = sluggish erections.  
Going in starving = jittery nerves.

**Best zone:**

* A light protein + carb combo (chicken and rice, oatmeal with banana, or Greek yogurt with honey).
* Small portions 1½–2 hours before.
* Avoid fried, creamy, or greasy food — they slow circulation.

# 💧 2. Hydrate, But Don’t Overdo It

Dehydration thickens your blood and raises heart rate, which can lead to faster release.  
Too much water, though, makes you bloated or anxious about peeing.

**Ideal:** one full glass of water 30 – 60 minutes before.  
Skip sodas or energy drinks — the sugar and caffeine spike sensitivity.

# 🚫 3. Cut the Usual Killers

**Caffeine, nicotine, alcohol** — the “big three” you read about earlier.  
Quick recap:

* Coffee = overstimulated nerves → quick release.
* Cigarettes = weak circulation → inconsistent control.
* Alcohol = dulled response → delayed or failed erection.

If you drink, stop after one small glass of wine or beer and give it an hour to clear.

# 🧘 4. Warm Up the Mind, Not Just the Body

PE isn’t only about physical reflex; it’s about your nervous system balance.  
Do a quick grounding routine:

* 10 slow breaths (4-second inhale, 6-second exhale).
* Gentle pelvic or hip stretches — butterfly pose or deep squat for 30 sec.
* Quick cold rinse or shower to calm adrenaline.

This drops stress hormones fast and puts you in the control zone.

# 🌿 5. Optional Edge Support

If you’re using a natural control aid like *EjaGuard*, apply it during this 2-hour window.  
It takes roughly 15–20 minutes to absorb fully and gives a smoother, more aware sensation — no numbness, no rush.  
Think of it as syncing your body chemistry before go-time, not a last-minute rescue.

# 🕒 Your Two-Hour Game Plan

|Time|What to Do|Why It Helps|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**T-120 min**|Light meal|Stable energy, steady blood flow|
|**T-90 min**|Hydrate moderately|Keeps circulation smooth|
|**T-60 min**|Stretch + breathe|Calms nerves, boosts oxygen|
|**T-30 min**|Optional herbal spray|Balances sensitivity|
|**T-15 min**|Set mood, low light, slow pace|Lowers pressure, raises arousal control|

# TL;DR:

Skip caffeine and booze, eat light but enough, hydrate once, stretch, breathe, and stay present.

1o6izrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o6izrk/losing_it_advice_please/,Losing it. Advice Please.,"My role is a mix of accounting and administration. So this ranges from processing invoices to organising work events, ordering stationary, etc. I have two degrees:

- Bachelors in Business
- Masters in Accounting

I’ve been at this job, a little while now (over a year, under 2 years) and I’m feeling like I made the worse decision of my life. I relocated back home to take this job, because my partner and I wanted to be closer to our family and to also start our own family here.

In my initial interview, I was mainly asked accounting questions. Let’s say 80% accounting and 20% admin. To give you a bit on context on my experience, I’ve managed accounting teams, ran accounting departments by myself and I’m a pretty independent worker. But this new role, the breakdown of workload is below:

25% is accounting.
45% is administration. 
20% is support work to my boss. (I.e. secretarial work)
10% is adhoc** (to explain later) 

So I feel a bit bamboozled on the role because there was a heavy focus on accounting in my interview. But the role is everything but accounting. The administration work is not hard/challenging so I don’t mind it. But the support to my boss and adhoc are driving me nuts. 

Disclaimer, my boss has a disability relating to mobility. But still can move around throughout most of the office without issue. I won’t go into detail was I don’t want to make this identifiable in any way but I feel like this information is important as to why I mention it ahead of me going into detail. 

Every morning, I am asked to make them breakfast. This could range from tea, coffee, toast or warming up something. (Our office kitchen is not accessible). While it doesn’t seem like much, it feels a bit excessive given I make and eat my breakfast before I come to work. (Boss is married/has live-in young-adult kids). 

I’ve spoken to my family and friends and they’ve asked why the work kitchen isn’t accessible. Which I’ve never thought of because the rest of the building is. I feel too afraid to ask, because the person that was in this role previous to me made the breakfast everyday with no complaints so I don’t want to seem like an a**hole. 

On top of the whole breakfast thing, I’m asked to do the most random things which feel like a waste of time my time. And I’m not 100% sure, if this is normal admin work because my experience is just in accounting. My boss will email me, asking me to save an email down to a specific folder (folder to be provided in email) rather than just save it down themselves. And I mean, they will go to the file location copy it and then email me to save it down. This may seem small but everything is adding up. In my eyes, being efficient you’d save it down yourself since you deem it important to save. It’s almost as though whatever thought they have i’m asked to develop it, which is fine but nothing ever comes from it. 

With my accounting work, I’m proficient in Excel so I move pretty quickly with my work. Each month I prepare the same report and each month we have to go through it line by line, including when it’s budget season which is 1 excel sheet with 60 lines. It took us 3 days last year to complete this task because they don’t retain the information or are unsure of the budget. I asked if I could prepare the report, then they review and then we meet to discuss questions. They said that doesn’t work for them. I also tried to come up with a work around for the random requests asking to put them in a document so I can review once a day so I can stay focused on other tasks. I was told no, that doesn’t work for me again.

I’m messaged all throughout the day to do the most random things. Call a book store, to source a book but it wasn’t purchased (I found the book online for free and even that wasn’t used), speak to the landlord of the building to ask when a broken chair which was removed to be repaired would be returned in a shared reception area (We have our own reception area btw, we pass through the shared reception to get to our board room). And this shared reception area has other seating available. 

The boss wanted a desk to be removed from their our office, I contacted a company to come, ahead of their arrival they saw/spoke to someone removing furniture from our building. And instead of asking them directly when they were speaking to them, they messaged me to speak to them to remove the desk. 

Another issue, (admin-related) an employee in our office takes well above the designated time for their break. I’ve documented and communicated that to boss. They did nothing about it, so I stopped documenting it. And coworkers advised this has occurred over 10 years. Recently, I’ve been told to start documenting again. And I asked what for, as nothing changes. (Another ethical issue) but they are technically stealing from the company in my opinion. 

We have a strategist that comes in once a week to discuss external engagement/communications with my boss. Whenever they are in, I’m instructed to call different companies to source different items and they are never purchased. So it feels like a waste of my time. I could also be instructed to schedule different engagements and then the week of told to cancel them. And I mention this because we are paying this person £6-8k a month, which doesn’t seem to be a good use of our funds. And to add this is my bosses good friend so it doesn’t feel ethical as an accountant that we use this person. But again too afraid to say something or I don’t know if all of these things are credible reasons to take it further. 

Other examples, include packing bosses bag for them to go home. Picking up lunch for them from a nearby restaurant. Like the list goes on. If they’ve forget something in their office while in the boardroom I’ll be asked to get it, phone, pen, book. (Boss office and boardroom near each other and my desk is further away) when they could get it themselves. 

My boss is travelling for a work event, and ordered business cards from a company, they have to be collected. Instead of asking the employee they wanted to collect them directly, my boss messaged me to ask the person. And I said I don’t have details on the collection, could they ask them directly and they said I’ve emailed you details… I feel like that my last straw. Additionally, boss is travelling with young-adult child. I was asked to book tickets for adult-child and this doesn’t seem work related or in my job description. And the tickets required dietary and accessibility requirements. None of which I know. I expressed my discomfort in booking and was told to book anyways. I booked the child’s and then asked boss to book their own because it had a form requesting accessibility needs and they were annoyed that I wasn’t comfortable booking it. 

**I say all this to say, a specific line in my job description that’s under adhoc says “perform any other duties direct by my boss” and I fear this covers breakfast, and all the other tasks. 

My team is small, under 10 people. And everyone here has worked here for more than 8 years ranging up to 15 years. 

My partner has suggested I report this but one I’m unsure of who my boss reports to and I don’t want to come across as unhelpful/rude because this person has a disability. I’m looking for other work, but nothings out there at the moment. I’m also happy to move jobs as I’m the newest employee and it’s not working for me. And if it works for them, that’s fine with me. But can anyone give me advice? Life, career, something. I’m in my early 30s and I feel miserable.",1,1760456516.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1o6izdw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6izdw,Charlottesville VA- Boar’s Head Resort candid review- AVOID AT ALL COSTS (oh and this stay was not booked nor recommended by a travel agent),"As it regards Charlottesville Virginia Resorts- STAY AWAY from Boar’s Head Resort owned by the UVA Foundation unless you absolutely have to come here for UVA/conference purposes (note: this was not a stay booked by any travel agent! I have seen some people recommend this resort in the recent past on this community and I just want everyone to know- please save yourself some money and headache- don’t book this one. STAY AWAY from Boar’s Head Resort at all costs. Stay at Keswick Hall, Albemarle Estate, or even Farmhouse at Veritas (if you want a B&B feel). We recently stayed at Boar’s Head and it was a huge nightmare. The tennis facilities are not at all worth the price of a stay here. The exterior grounds are kept well but that’s where it ends- the inside of the hotel is a disaster.  

*****Heads up- I did not book through a luxury travel agent, and furthermore most that I know are not affiliated with this property, and there’s a clear reason why there are literally no luxury travel agents affiliated with this property, but I did use my iPrefer membership to book. I could not cancel this stay and book another resort anyway after booking this one, since Boar’s Head does NOT have a cancellation policy with any sort of refund, they will charge you for the full stay regardless of how far in advance you cancel. For the weekend I stayed, there was NO refundable rate available. ***** 


I am merely posting this in the community so that people who are considering this resort for any sort of chubby travel think twice and instead please ask a luxury travel agent to book Keswick Hall since it’s the only 5 star resort in Charlottesville and totally worth it compared to the nightmare I sustained at Boar’s Head. I have seen a few people recommend Boar’s Head in this sub before and I assure you, the recent reviews are evidence of the poor management at this resort and it has gone downhill compared to whatever it may have been in years past. Relevant pictures included from stay.  

One fun fact I learned during my stay: the new GM of this hotel was let go of by Four Seasons Resorts (FS San Francisco Embarcadero), which explains why they are working at this establishment and not something better. Also, the director of operations here at Boar’s Head also hails from another Four Seasons property and they tried telling me at first that they were a “general manager” at the particular Four Seasons property in question, but joke is on them because I know the GM at the FS property they lied about their former job position at, and I also found out that they were just a night time front desk concierge during their time there. When Four Seasons lets go of employees *most* of the time it’s due to poor performance. I know there are some exceptions to the rule, such as FS Santa Barbara which is under fire due to unfair employment practices, but neither of these former FS employees worked at FS Santa Barbara. 

Again, wish I had consulted with a travel agent prior to booking this stay, as I would have never ever considered Boar’s Head and I had no way of pulling out of my reservation by the time I had second doubts, because Boar’s Head does NOT have a cancellation clause that allows for any refund for the weekend I stayed (no refundable rate was offered), not even if you try to cancel weeks in advance. They don’t allow cancellations once the stay is booked for the weekend I stayed. 

Lesson learned: book with whoever your luxury travel agent is. 

1. Prior to check in they called me the day before and told me (even though I never asked about this) that my complementary room upgrade would not be honored because they’re fully booked that weekend with 4 weddings…. This is not okay and very wrong, as an upgrade should be offered at time of check-in per the iPrefer program, so there was really no point in them calling me a day prior, as the whole upgrade process happens *at check in*

2. On our first night: Mold lining the trim on the wall behind the bathroom in our first room which caused us a night of congestion, hard mattress causing back pain, terribly low pressure in the shower due to hard water mineral deposits, leaky shower with no properly seal causing water to leak constantly out of the shower no matter how hard you try to close the door shut, and causing a slippery safety hazard, dry rot wood lining the balcony - a lakeside room which was REALLY SMALL and not even the room I booked. Guest services moved us after the first night since I emailed iPrefer member services as well as the hotel management team. Can you imagine paying $700-800 a night for this sort of thing? I can’t. 

3. Second room was a parlor junior suite which was much more spacious and the bed was way more comfortable but had issues of its own- dead bugs everywhere covered in dust which means they were missed by housekeeping for many weeks if not months, the rungs on the lone shower caddy shelf were falling apart, towel hook in the bathroom needs tightening with an allen key wrench so it was virtually not usable since it kept falling off and had to be twisted sideways to just stay on the wall, noisy next door neighbors with screaming kids and screaming parents who kept us up throughout the night with their screaming and constant repeat replay of King Harvest’s hit song “Dancing in the Moonlight” until 2AM in the morning

3. Mill Room breakfast was a disaster- terrible service, half an hour wait for a server to come over to offer coffee or beverages, “fresh squeezed” grapefruit or orange juice comes out of Tropicana cartons in the bar fridge and they charge extra for grapefruit or orange juice- but don’t worry, the buffet has apple/cranberry/tomato juices for free, just no citrus juices, oh no you have to pay for those even though the citrus juices are the more common breakfast juices….they were always out of items in the menu, the only saving grace was the restaurant’s updated look. When I come to a restaurant on site though, I don’t care about looks, I care about service which was less than stellar.
One of the waiters even told us “oh nobody wants to work anymore I’m the only one working this weekend” and that was just sad to hear. I can see why nobody wants to work here…. For the price of the menu items at a resort that claims “4 diamond status of their resort restaurant” it shouldn’t be like this. The drinks were ok. Espresso martini was mid, their “signature” Virginia bourbon peach basil smash cocktail claimed it had “fresh” peaches but then I saw them take the peaches straight from a can, found wilted basil in my drink, and the bourbon was way too much and too strong, so I didn’t even taste the canned peaches or wilted basil. 

Pros about the resort, if there are any: 
-beautiful exterior grounds, lots of tennis courts and pools, but the hot tub was closed during the weekend we stayed, and I did not book any spa treatments but I did hear many patrons at the Mill
Room bar and restaurant complain about their spa appointments more than once during my stay. 

***********************************************
RESOLUTIONS:
As a result of all of these faux pas I personally experienced, I emailed both the Boar’s Head resort management/reservations team and iPrefer membership services and here were their resolutions to my experiences: comped the entire stay at checkout due to the noise complaint the last night, which was icing on the cake for everyone in earshot of that one room
with the screaming kids and music from what the front desk told us at checkout, and they did send a free bottle of Nicolas Feuillate champagne out after the first night’s issues, which we took home since we never found the right opportunity to open it considering all the issues with our stay. 

TLDR:
I do not recommend anyone book or consider this resort based on my experiences, and there is a reason why many many luxury travel agents are not affiliated with this resort. It is going downhill fast. I am shocked that anyone has even recommended it in the past recent years considering how downhill it has gone. The exterior grounds and tennis courts are beautiful but for $700-$800 a night I am not paying to sleep on the tennis courts. Inside of the hotel is poorly managed and a disaster. There are better accommodations than this in Charlottesville- like Keswick Hall. Consult with a luxury travel agent prior to booking anything. I know some people like the tennis at Boar’s Head but you can get nice courts anywhere and not pay to stay at a hotel such as this nightmare. Lesson learned for me. Usually I stay at FS/Rosewood/Ritz Reserve properties anyway so I guess I’m just used to better accommodations. Just putting my experience here so people don’t make the mistake of even considering or blinking twice at this property. ",11,1760456493.0,chubbytravel,2,1.0,False

1o6iwmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1o6iwmh/losing_it_advice_please/,Losing it. Advice please.,"My role is a mix of accounting and administration. So this ranges from processing invoices to organising work events, ordering stationary, etc. I have two degrees:

- Bachelors in Business
- Masters in Accounting

I’ve been at this job, a little while now (over a year, under 2 years) and I’m feeling like I made the worse decision of my life. I relocated back home to take this job, because my partner and I wanted to be closer to our family and to also start our own family here.

In my initial interview, I was mainly asked accounting questions. Let’s say 80% accounting and 20% admin. To give you a bit on context on my experience, I’ve managed accounting teams, ran accounting departments by myself and I’m a pretty independent worker. But this new role, the breakdown of workload is below:

25% is accounting.
45% is administration. 
20% is support work to my boss. (I.e. secretarial work)
10% is adhoc** (to explain later) 

So I feel a bit bamboozled on the role because there was a heavy focus on accounting in my interview. But the role is everything but accounting. The administration work is not hard/challenging so I don’t mind it. But the support to my boss and adhoc are driving me nuts. 

Disclaimer, my boss has a disability relating to mobility. But still can move around throughout most of the office without issue. I won’t go into detail was I don’t want to make this identifiable in any way but I feel like this information is important as to why I mention it ahead of me going into detail. 

Every morning, I am asked to make them breakfast. This could range from tea, coffee, toast or warming up something. (Our office kitchen is not accessible). While it doesn’t seem like much, it feels a bit excessive given I make and eat my breakfast before I come to work. (Boss is married/has live-in young-adult kids). 

I’ve spoken to my family and friends and they’ve asked why the work kitchen isn’t accessible. Which I’ve never thought of because the rest of the building is. I feel too afraid to ask, because the person that was in this role previous to me made the breakfast everyday with no complaints so I don’t want to seem like an a**hole. 

On top of the whole breakfast thing, I’m asked to do the most random things which feel like a waste of time my time. And I’m not 100% sure, if this is normal admin work because my experience is just in accounting. My boss will email me, asking me to save an email down to a specific folder (folder to be provided in email) rather than just save it down themselves. And I mean, they will go to the file location copy it and then email me to save it down. This may seem small but everything is adding up. In my eyes, being efficient you’d save it down yourself since you deem it important to save. It’s almost as though whatever thought they have i’m asked to develop it, which is fine but nothing ever comes from it. 

With my accounting work, I’m proficient in Excel so I move pretty quickly with my work. Each month I prepare the same report and each month we have to go through it line by line, including when it’s budget season which is 1 excel sheet with 60 lines. It took us 3 days last year to complete this task because they don’t retain the information or are unsure of the budget. I asked if I could prepare the report, then they review and then we meet to discuss questions. They said that doesn’t work for them. I also tried to come up with a work around for the random requests asking to put them in a document so I can review once a day so I can stay focused on other tasks. I was told no, that doesn’t work for me again.

I’m messaged all throughout the day to do the most random things. Call a book store, to source a book but it wasn’t purchased (I found the book online for free and even that wasn’t used), speak to the landlord of the building to ask when a broken chair which was removed to be repaired would be returned in a shared reception area (We have our own reception area btw, we pass through the shared reception to get to our board room). And this shared reception area has other seating available. 

The boss wanted a desk to be removed from their our office, I contacted a company to come, ahead of their arrival they saw/spoke to someone removing furniture from our building. And instead of asking them directly when they were speaking to them, they messaged me to speak to them to remove the desk. 

Another issue, (admin-related) an employee in our office takes well above the designated time for their break. I’ve documented and communicated that to boss. They did nothing about it, so I stopped documenting it. And coworkers advised this has occurred over 10 years. Recently, I’ve been told to start documenting again. And I asked what for, as nothing changes. (Another ethical issue) but they are technically stealing from the company in my opinion. 

We have a strategist that comes in once a week to discuss external engagement/communications with my boss. Whenever they are in, I’m instructed to call different companies to source different items and they are never purchased. So it feels like a waste of my time. I could also be instructed to schedule different engagements and then the week of told to cancel them. And I mention this because we are paying this person £6-8k a month, which doesn’t seem to be a good use of our funds. And to add this is my bosses good friend so it doesn’t feel ethical as an accountant that we use this person. But again too afraid to say something or I don’t know if all of these things are credible reasons to take it further. 

Other examples, include packing bosses bag for them to go home. Picking up lunch for them from a nearby restaurant. Like the list goes on. If they’ve forget something in their office while in the boardroom I’ll be asked to get it, phone, pen, book. (Boss office and boardroom near each other and my desk is further away) when they could get it themselves. 

My boss is travelling for a work event, and ordered business cards from a company, they have to be collected. Instead of asking the employee they wanted to collect them directly, my boss messaged me to ask the person. And I said I don’t have details on the collection, could they ask them directly and they said I’ve emailed you details… I feel like that my last straw. Additionally, boss is travelling with young-adult child. I was asked to book tickets for adult-child and this doesn’t seem work related or in my job description. And the tickets required dietary and accessibility requirements. None of which I know. I expressed my discomfort in booking and was told to book anyways. I booked the child’s and then asked boss to book their own because it had a form requesting accessibility needs and they were annoyed that I wasn’t comfortable booking it. 

**I say all this to say, a specific line in my job description that’s under adhoc says “perform any other duties direct by my boss” and I fear this covers breakfast, and all the other tasks. 

My team is small, under 10 people. And everyone here has worked here for more than 8 years ranging up to 15 years. 

My partner has suggested I report this but one I’m unsure of who my boss reports to and I don’t want to come across as unhelpful/rude because this person has a disability. I’m looking for other work, but nothings out there at the moment. I’m also happy to move jobs as I’m the newest employee and it’s not working for me. And if it works for them, that’s fine with me. But can anyone give me advice? Life, career, something. I’m in my early 30s and I feel miserable.",1,1760456320.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

I'm an upper management boss while she is just rank&file sales rep. We have a few years age gap but she is very matured (27 sya). She is a single mom. Di ko sya masyadong napapansin noon pero for some reason bigla akong naattract sakanya. Napansin ko lang yung attraction ko sakanya siguro about 6 months ago. Before this, wala lang talaga. Di ko naman sya always nakakausap or nakakainteract (ibang department ako). Bigyan nyo naman ako ng advise.

How do I express my interest in her subtly? Ayaw ko sya ligawan, as it seems from our short talks na hindi naman sya ready or naghahanap (or baka mali basa ko). It would also be inappropriate if ligawan ko sya outright kasi nga magka-office kami. Dami rin kasi umaaligid sakanya sa office.

So far, I noticed myself (as in unplanned) that I have been giving her special treatment in terms of acts of service, gift and time. Out of nowhere talaga, unplanned naiisip ko like bilhan sya ng coffee kapag bumibili ako. One time nagshop ako ng snacks, bumili rin ako for her kid (uwian narin kasi). She asked for help sa isang meeting and kahit 3 hours away from me (di kami magkasabay), I had to wake up at 5am just to be there by 9am. I normally don't join meetings like that na malayo sakin and just attend online as my time is precious.

Mga ganyang bagay na na-catch ko nalang yung sarili ko one day na ""potek ano ba tong ginagawa ko"" and napa-introspect ako kung anong meron. Then one time during lunch sumabay ako sa kanila, and there i noticed myself that i keep looking at her whenever theres a joke....

What do I want to do? I want to subtly express my interest in her - without any expectation of her reciprocating what I'm feeling. I am simply interested in her and in her success.

Hay nako. ang hirap ng ganitong feeling. Ano bang gagawin. Minumulto nako ng damdamin ko!

My dog decided that my cup of coffee was clearly poison and launched himself at me like a caffeine fighting superhero. The coffee went flying. The cat, who had been sitting peacefully on the counter definitely not allowed, took one look at the incoming splash and bolted straight through the curtains. Now I have what looks like a “custom air vent” in my living room.



While I was cleaning the mess, my parrot started yelling, “WHAT DID YOU DO?!” which, by the way, is something I apparently say too often. So now I’m being mocked by a bird with a better memory than mine.



By the time everything calmed down, the dog was wagging his tail proudly like he’d saved my life, the cat was pretending she had never even heard of me, and the parrot was still chanting, “COFFEE DOWN! COFFEE DOWN!” like a news reporter.

first i generated about a dozen stills in midjourney cozy morning coffee, walking through the city, sunsets, that kind of aesthetic. i uploaded them all to domoai, selected its smooth handheld camera style, and gave a few prompts like “soft bokeh light,” “slow zoom,” and “natural sway.” domoai immediately turned those stills into moving scenes that looked like they came from a real camera.  
the best part was pacing. i didn’t have to cut anything manually. i imported everything into opusclip, set it to auto-trim for tiktok, and it automatically found the best 10-second segments that matched the beat.

Detailed Review,"Testing out the Samsung DA29-20B HAF-CIN/EXP Refrigerator Water Filter has been quite the experience. Living in a family with two hydration-obsessed kids and a coffee-loving partner, it's safe to say that we put this filter through its paces. Before diving in, let me mention the official claim: this filter removes over 99% of potentially harmful contaminants, thanks to its high-grade carbon block, and lasts up to six months or 300 gallons. That sounded promising, but experiencing it firsthand added some valuable insights.

**Design and Compatibility**  
The design of this refrigerator water filter is straightforward, with a compact form that fits neatly into my Samsung fridge. I was pleased to find that installation required almost no effort—just a twist-and-lock mechanism; my 12-year-old managed it without assistance! It's compatible with various Samsung fridge models, and thankfully, our RF28HFEDBSR was on the list. If you've got a compatible refrigerator, you’ll avoid the headache of rechecking dimensions or model numbers repeatedly. 

[Check Samsung DA29-20B HAF-CIN/EXP price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07hnt8sql/)

**Filtration Performance**  
After installing the filter, I tested the taste and clarity of our water. The most noticeable change was the complete reduction of any chlorine aftertaste, which was an annoyance with our previous filter. My partner, who’s sensitive to even the faintest odors, confirmed the water smelled and tasted better. The clear improvement in taste also made it perfect for brewing our morning coffee or filling up reusable water bottles for our kids' soccer practice. Additionally, the water looked crystal-clear, which gave us peace of mind about what we're consuming daily.  

**Advantages**  
- Provides cleaner and better-tasting drinking water.  
- Tested and certified to remove over 99% of potential contaminants.  
- Long-lasting, with up to six months or 300 gallons of functionality.  

**Build Quality and Certification**  
During its time in our fridge, the filter didn’t cause leaks or any noticeable pressure drop. NSF certification, a trust marker for safety and quality, is stamped on this product, which reassured us. The high-grade carbon material inside deserves a nod here—it seems to do all the magic when filtering out impurities. However, I wish Samsung would package it with clearer usage instructions for those who aren't super tech-savvy. 

**Maintenance and Lifespan**  
The six-month lifespan for this fridge filter is spot on. We've used it consistently for nearly four months now, and there seems to be no dip in quality. A small LED indicator on our fridge reminds us when it’s nearing replacement, simplifying the process. The feature is practical, especially for busy families or forgetful individuals. While advertised to last 300 gallons, I bet this figure varies depending on water usage—the busy mornings in our home made us conscious of how often we were refilling cups and bottles.

**Negatives**  
- Could use clearer installation instructions for non-tech users.  
- Somewhat pricey compared to generic alternatives.  

**Competing Products**  
Before settling on this Samsung filter, I briefly considered third-party brands that claimed compatibility with Samsung fridges. While they were cheaper, a bit of research revealed these alternatives often fell short in certification and contaminant removal. A prominent competitor, the EveryDrop by Whirlpool, is similarly efficient but fails to match the seamless compatibility with Samsung appliances. Although other filters boasted durability beyond six months, I prioritized the assurance of tested performance over longevity concerns. Even the lesser-known filters tended to diminish water taste over time—a critical criterion in my home.

**Bang for the Buck**  
While this refrigerator filter does cost more than some generic counterparts, I consider it a worthwhile investment for my family’s health. It’s rare to find a filter that delivers reliable performance without compromising the taste and safety of the water. By eliminating the expense of bottled water and offering dependable filtration, the filter essentially pays for itself within a couple of months. If you're on the fence about cost, weigh the safety promises and NSF assurance against the savings you could gain with cheaper brands—it made my decision clear.

1o6ip18,https://www.reddit.com/r/DominicanSpanish/comments/1o6ip18/your_ultimate_guide_to_learning_spanish_and/,🌎 Your Ultimate Guide to Learning Spanish (And Actually Sticking With It This Time),"Hey there. If the thought of learning Spanish is swirling in your head with all those verb tenses, grammatical genders, and tricky conjugations take a deep breath. You're not alone. The truth is, you don't need to be a genius to speak Spanish fluently. What you do need is a solid system, a dash of consistency, and, above all, the right kind of support.

This guide is to help you take the leap, once and for all.

---

🧠 1. Understand How Your Brain Really Learns

Forget about just ""memorizing endless lists."" The secret isn't studying harder, but combining exposure + repetition + gentle correction.

You learn best when you:

· Hear real Spanish used in natural contexts.
· Repeat and practice out loud (yes, talk to yourself!).
· Get corrected kindly so your brain internalizes the patterns.

This is exactly how children learn their first language—and it works the same for adults. It's about acquiring the language, not just memorizing it.

💡 Learn More: The linguist Stephen Krashen's theory of ""Comprehensible Input"" is key here. The idea is that we acquire language when we understand messages that are just slightly above our current level. Read a simple explanation here.

---

🔤 2. Build a Strong Foundation (The Smart Way)

Before you dive into advanced grammar, focus on the pillars that will support everything else:
✅High-Frequency Vocabulary: The most common 1,000 words make up about 80% of everyday conversations. Start here!
✅Basic Sentence Patterns: Learn how sentences are built, not every single grammar rule from day one.
✅Pronunciation from the Start: It's much easier to build good habits than to fix entrenched bad ones later.

Pro Tip: Apps are fantastic for building vocabulary, but they often can't explain why something sounds ""off."" This is where a real teacher or tutor becomes invaluable for bridging that gap.

🛠️ Helpful Tools:

· For Vocabulary: Anki (a powerful, free spaced-repetition flashcard app).
· For Foundation: Language Transfer (a brilliant free audio course that teaches you how to think about the language).

---

🗣️ 3. Immerse Yourself—Without Leaving Your Home

You don't need to move to Madrid or Mexico City to live in Spanish. Try this instead:

· 🎧 Listen: Spanish podcasts, music, or audiobooks (even if you only understand 30% at first, your brain is tuning in).
· 📺 Watch: Spanish shows on Netflix with subtitles (start with English subtitles, then switch to Spanish).
· 📱 Change Your Phone's Language: These small, constant exposures add up significantly.
· 💬 Talk: Speak with real people. Even 10-15 minutes of conversation a few times a week can transform your skills and confidence.

If you're shy or don't know where to start, guided conversation with a tutor provides a safe space to practice, make mistakes, and build confidence quickly.

🛠️ Helpful Tools:

· For Listening: Dreaming Spanish (a fantastic platform built entirely around comprehensible input).
· For Watching: Easy Spanish (YouTube series with street interviews and dual subtitles).
· For Speaking: iTalki or Preply (platforms to find affordable community tutors and professional teachers).

---

📚 4. Use the 70/30 Approach

Balance your time wisely:

· 70% of your time using the language (speaking, listening, writing a journal, consuming media).
· 30% of your time on structured study (grammar drills, vocabulary flashcards, taking notes).

This balance keeps the language alive and helps your brain connect words to real meaning and context, moving beyond abstract rules.

---

🕒 5. Create a Realistic (And Kind) Routine

Consistency will always beat cramming.
💡Even 20 minutes a day is far better than 2 hours once a week.

Try this sample weekly plan:

· Mon-Wed: Short grammar or vocab session (15–30 min).
· Thu-Fri: Speaking practice with a tutor or a language exchange partner.
· Weekend: Watch an episode of a Spanish show, listen to a podcast on a walk, or write a few sentences in a journal.

Small steps + daily contact = long-term fluency.

---

🔍 6. Track Your Progress & Celebrate

Keep a simple learning journal. Write down new words you love, phrases you finally understood, and small wins like, ""I ordered coffee in Spanish without stumbling!"" or ""I caught the gist of a meme!"" Acknowledging your progress is crucial for staying motivated when you hit a plateau.

---

🤝 7. Don't Walk the Path Alone

Let's be honest learning a language by yourself can sometimes feel like wandering in the dark. A good tutor does more than just teach; they:

· Keep you accountable and on track.
· Help you fix mistakes before they become bad habits.
· Gently push you out of your comfort zone.
· Personalize lessons around your interests and goals.

If you're serious about speaking fluently, consider adding weekly tutoring sessions. It's the fastest way to build confidence for real-world conversation.

---

🌟 Final Words of Encouragement

Spanish is not just a language—it's a doorway to millions of people, rich cultures, and new opportunities.
You don't need to be perfect.You just need to show up and keep practicing.

Remember: fluency isn't magic. It's the direct result of consistent, guided immersion.
So start today,stay curious, and if you ever feel stuck, remember that asking for help is a sign of strength. You can do this.

1o6ilx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1o6ilx2/trip_report_104_to_108/,Trip Report 10/4 to 10/8,"Hi everyone! My wife daughter (8) and I had a fantastic trip to Disney last week and I thought I’d share some (many) likes and (a few) dislikes from our recent trip. We packed an absolute ton into a short trip, as Disney is a once every few years treat for us.

Our home base resort was Allstar Sports. We arrived mid afternoon on Saturday. We had a room over in the baseball section and loved it.

Here is what we liked;

The cast members were all fantastic and kind.
Everything was very clean. The layout was pretty compact and simple. Both the main and small pool were a fantastic place to cool off and have some fun. Overall I would say if Sports is the only way you are staying on property, it’s well worth it.

Here is what we didn’t like;

The food was just okay. (More neutral than a didn’t like) Not note worthy at all in either a bad or good way. (Except one pretty abominable chicken parm). Also our body wash dispenser wasn’t working. We brought that up to a cast member. They said it would be fixed right away. It didn’t happen. Not at all a big deal. Sometimes little things slip through the cracks, and thankfully we had our own. 

We did stop by Disney Springs the first night for a couple hours. We were hoping to have dinner at Polite Pig. I didn’t yet have a handle on mobile ordering and it was an absolute zoo, so we pivoted to Dluxe Burger. I’m really glad that we did! The burgers and shakes were fantastic. Fries were hit it or miss amongst my party. (They are kind of a more rustic skin on kind of deal). I loved them, my wife and daughter were kind of meh. We had a nice covered spot over looking the little creek to sit and enjoy.

We spent an evening in Epcot

Here is what we liked;

Guardians is absolutely stunning. An incredible piece of work. I could not recommend it highly enough. Visually stunning, thrilling, fun 10/10. Soarin was wonderful as always. We got in really quickly to see Mickey and Minnie and Goofy. That was really spectacular for my daughter especially. A kind stranger took a really nice picture of us sitting on the Walt Disney bench. Remy was good. (I also think there is a high level of ingenuity to kind of book end World Showcase with rides that are popular for the kids) Las Halles was also spectacular. My wife got a baguette. My daughter and I each got these macarons that were filled (think like a whoopie pie) with raspberry jam, fresh raspberries, and lemon cream. Absolutely a world class dessert. 

Here is what we didn’t like;

Frozen was our last lightning lane of the day. It broke down. That was a small bummer, but things happen sometimes. Mission Space being closed for refurb was a bit sad for me, but I’m glad that it’s getting a little bit of tlc.

We spent a morning early afternoon is Animal Kingdom. 

Here is what we liked;

Pandora is absolutely world class. It’s beautiful, stunning and immersive. River journey is a pleasant ride. (Probably not really worth it without a lightning lane, but still pleasant). Flight of passage is incredible. I can see how the seats would pose a challenge to anyone whom is any combination of heavyset, busty, or very tall. (I am very tall). But the ride was amazing. It is now referred colloquially as “Super Soarin” in our household. The safari is absolutely world class as always. (The lions were out for us!) As is the gorilla trail.  Flametree BBQ was really good. Joffrey’s Coffee on the way out was amazing and gave us the revive that we needed.

Here is what we didn’t like;

I wish they gave a better bbq sauce than Ken’s at Flametree. But that’s all I’ve got.

We spent an afternoon/evening at Hollywood Studios

Here is what we liked; 

Mickey and Minnie’s was cute.  My wife loved Tower of Terror. (My daughter and I narrowly escaped soiling ourselves, so that’s a win) Star Wars was fantastic. Just completely immersive and fun. Rise was great. It felt like being in a movie. Exceptionally well done. Smuggler’s run was also pretty good. Kiddo got a little upset about not being a pilot, so an exceptionally kind cast member had us wait an extra couple minutes so just the three of us could go together. That was really really kind. Docking Bay 7 was really freaking cool and the food was solid. Toy Story land was also great. We skipped Slinky, but the kid enjoyed the kind of slower low stakes Alien ride, and we did Midway Mania twice. Fantasmic was also cool. 

Here is what we didn’t like;

The crowd flowing out of Fantasmic was pretty chaotic, and congested. Only having one exit kind of led to a little bit of a pileup and it’s an awfully long walk back to the buses. I would think that it would be helpful to have more than one exit.

We did a morning at Magic Kingdom, and also the Halloween Party.

Here is what we liked;

Going to Magic Kingdom on a party morning is great! Very low crowds, and we got to do an awful lot. My daughter was very excited to meet Rapunzel, who was great. She also got to meet Tiana who was absolutely fantastic. All the classics are great. Peter Pan is cool. Little Mermaid is solid. 7 Dwarves is really fun. Pirates is awesome. PhillarMagic is an underrated 15 minutes out of the sun. People Mover is a really pleasant handful of minutes and a was pretty much a walk on. The Halloween overlay on Haunted Mansion was stunning. The Jack Skellington fireworks were really cool. We had a special Halloween Whoopie Pie that was aesthetically a 10/10 and tasted pretty good.

Here is what we didn’t like;

Surprisingly MK ended up being the consensus least favorite park. I don’t personally think the Halloween party is worth it. We certainly had a nice time, but I don’t think we would choose to do it again. We got in around 3:30 and we were really packed in like Sardines. (I would actually Zig Zag if we did it again and show up at 4:30). The crowd over lap between 4 and 6 was a lot. It definitely felt busier than people have made it out to be during the party itself. I also think MK is the worst food park by a country mile. I hear wonderful things about Harbor House but my wife is allergic to shellfish, so it’s a skip for us. We had kind of a desperation meal at Village Haus, and it was honestly appallingly bad. Those 
Flatbreads tasted like cold cold sadness. (And I ordered on the app and picked up right away so I don’t know how they were cold). Even Main St confectionary just kind of felt like 8 million Mickey Rice Krispie treats and Marshmallows. It’s still good, but it just kind of seems like it’s fallen behind the other parks in a sense of food quality, immersion, and rides.

Overall I’d say consensus ratings from our family would be something like;

Resort; 8/10.
Hollywood Studios; 9/10
Epcot;  9/10
Animal Kingdom; 9/10
MK on a party morning; 7.5/10

Grinder: Eureka Mignon Zero Single Dose
Machine: Lelit Elizabth

I am having trouble. I believe it is my grinder that I haven’t dialed in correctly. 

Background:  aeropress user. I’ve been looking to add a full espresso machine to the home. Decided to buy the eureka Mignon Zero Single Dose. I also purchased a Lelit Elizbethe machine. 

I am able to dial in the setup so that I can get 18g/36g ~28 seconds. It takes me 4-6 shots to get it right. Once I do, I can pull multiple shots. 
I am brewing at 93°c. 6 second low pressure preinfusion. Elizabeth consistent hitting 9-10bars of pressure. 

I am using some “assistive” tamping devices. MDT Tool, Mad Bomber leveler. Mad Bomber calibrated tamp. (I am trying to remove the tamping variable and get consistent puck prep for now. Goal is to eventually hand tamp without a calibrated system.)

I use freshly roasted beans from a local roasters. Medium roast. 

Workflow: (once Lelit is up to temp and remained at temp 25-30 additional minutes.)

I purge my head with empty portafilter attached. I fill my final cup with hot water to warm it.  I purge my steam wand. 

I run my Mignon Zero on empty for about a minute. I run a flush grind of about 2-3grams. 

Then I weigh out 18g of coffee. (I use a sur la table branded standard coffee scale in 0.1g increments.). I grind the coffee and work the bellows throughout. Nothing crazy, just some pushing on the bellow. I weigh out the grind and I am usually within 0.1g of pre measure. Often it is right on the money. 18g into grinder / 18g out of grinder. 

I transfer the grounds from my dosing cup to my Mad Bomber 58mm (e61 compatible) naked portafilter. I attach dosing ring and use my handheld WDT tool to work the grounds and remove any clumps. I remove the WDT tool and dosing ring. I use a MadBomber leveler to level out the coffee. Then I use the MadBomber precalibrated tamp. 

I attach my portafilter to my group head. I place a small glass onto my scale and zero out. I use the Elizabeth set to 6seconds of low pressure preinfusion. I start the machine and stop it when I am at 36g on the scale. 

After about 4-6 shots, I can get it consistent at 18g/36g ~ 25-30 seconds. Tastes great. Love it. Beautiful. 

Then the next morning I do the exact same thing. First puck is usually completely choked. Then I have to start the dial in process again. 4-6 shots and it’s back on track. I usually end up with my grinder in almost the same position that it was the day before. 

*I ordered a more accurate grind ring tool, but the hopper on the SD is not removable (glued in place to help the bellow / tight air seal.) So I couldn’t install the more accurate dial. 

What am I doing wrong?
What suggestions do you have for me?
Anyone with the same Grinder experiencing this?

Thanks so much in advance. 

TL/DR: Trouble dialing in Mignon Zero SD Grinder with Lelit Elizabeth. Grind consistency a problem.

We both grew up outside of Philly so we’re familiar with most areas but haven’t spent much time in that part of the city. We know it’s a bit of a departure in terms of activity/“coolness” but that’s sort of part of the appeal. We’re ready for a more suburban/family lifestyle without totally leaving the city.  

Basically we’re looking for:
-coffee shops/dive bar/restaurant we can walk to (under a mile away)
-quieter than our current busy street with nonstop traffic
-safer, in terms of things like ability to have packages delivered
-more space, particularly a yard

We have a car and drive most places so the distance from center city isn’t an issue. Traffic and 76 seem annoying but we also work from home so don’t have to be involved in that.  

Would love to hear opinions or suggestions for other areas!

1o6igdz,https://i.redd.it/mewdlp2ng3vf1.jpeg,"Sherlock vs Hannibal (both composite versions), who is better written?","composite here means all the movies, tv series and books considered into one's character writing together, who is better written?

I personally think hannibal mid diffs composite Sherlock Holmes, I'll explain my opinion

**INTRODUCTION (SHERLOCK 1: HANNIBAL 0)**

Sherlock Holmes’s introduction in A Study in Scarlet is a masterclass in character establishment through action and deduction. Watson’s list of conclusions about Holmes (“From a drop of water… a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara”) builds immense anticipation before we even see him work. Their first meeting, where Holmes instantly deduces Watson’s military service and injury, is an iconic, genre-defining moment that immediately sets the template for the genius detective. the bbc's execution of this scene is so good that got me actually hyped so much for this show and got really invested into the character of sherlock. Hannibal’s introductions are strong, like the creepy staring when starling first walked in, or the talk with one of his patients in nbc series, good but nothing outstanding. Holmes takes it.

**CONCLUSION (SHERLOCK 1: HANNIBAL 1)**

Give this to NBC’s Hannibal. While Sherlock has many conclusions (Reichenbach, the Fall, the confrontation with Moriarty at the falls), they are often followed by a return. The finale of Hannibal’s third season is a perfect, operatic, and conclusive endpoint. Will and Hannibal embracing and consummating their dark partnership by killing the Dragon together, then plunging off the cliff in a literal and metaphorical fall, along with the love crime shit is a shocking, poetic, and definitive end. It completes their destructive, symbiotic relationship with unparalleled grandeur. Sherlock’s stories are a cycle; Hannibal’s finale feels like a true, devastating conclusion. Point to Lecter prob. the fall is the best conclusion of sherlock but he resurrected so meh

**BACKSTORY (SHERLOCK 1: HANNIBAL 2)**

Easily Hannibal’s. Hannibal Rising, both the novel and film, provides a detailed, tragic, and brutal origin for the monster. The trauma of witnessing his sister Mischa’s cannibalization during WWII directly forges the vengeful, aristocratic cannibal he becomes. This backstory doesn’t excuse his actions but provides a powerful, mythic engine for his pathology. Sherlock’s backstory is deliberately vague; we know little of his family beyond Mycroft. It adds to his mystery, but it doesn’t actively fuel the narrative with the same visceral, tragic power as Hannibal’s. This is a clean sweep for the Doctor.

**DEPTH (SHERLOCK 1: HANNIBAL 3)**

Hannibal Lecter is a bottomless pit of psychological depth. He represents the ultimate paradox: a hyper-civilized man who is also a primal monster. He is a manipulator, a god-complex artist, a connoisseur of cruelty, and a curious observer of the human soul. His conversations with Will Graham about the fragility of morality and the design of God are profound explorations of darkness. Sherlock’s depth is intellectual and, in modern adaptations, social (his alienation, his boredom). But Hannibal’s depth is a philosophical and psychological abyss. He takes this category with ease.

**COMPLEXITY (SHERLOCK 1: HANNIBAL 4)**

Again, Hannibal easily. Sherlock is complex in his methods, but his motivations are often straightforward: the chase, the puzzle, the pursuit of justice. Hannibal Lecter’s complexity is labyrinthine. His motivations are a tangled web of aesthetic pursuit, personal vengeance, intellectual gamesmanship, and a twisted desire for companionship. He is therapist, killer, mentor, and nemesis to Will Graham, all at once. He builds intricate tableaus with his victims, each a piece of complex symbolism. He operates on so many simultaneous levels that he becomes a force of nature. No contest.

**DIALOGUE (SHERLOCK 1: HANNIBAL 5)**

Hannibal’s dialogue is a weapon, a seduction, and a work of art. It’s full of literary allusion, psychological insight, and chilling double-entendres, all delivered with impeccable, polite menace. “A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.” Or his entire speech about the Buddhist pig. Sherlock has brilliant, rapid-fire deductions and witty retorts (“You see, but you do not observe.”). But Hannibal’s dialogue is a sustained performance of high-class villainy that is unmatched. Remember the episode ""Mizumono""? Exactly. Point to Lecter.

**MONOLOGUES (SHERLOCK 2: HANNIBAL 5)**

Sherlock’s deductions are his monologues. The BBC version, in particular, turned these into visual and verbal set pieces that are breathtaking in their speed and cleverness. His explanation of how he knew the soldier in ""A Study in Pink"" was faking his injury, or his deconstruction of a crime scene in ""The Great Game,"" are iconic displays of intellectual superiority. They are active, plot-driving monologues. Hannibal’s monologues are more philosophical and hypnotic, but Sherlock’s deduction monologues are a fundamental, defining element of his character. He surpasses here.

**PHILOSOPHY (SHERLOCK 2: HANNIBAL 6)**

Hannibal’s worldview is a dark philosophy. He sees himself as an agent of natural selection, culling the ""rude"" and elevating those he deems worthy. His conversations probe the nature of God, morality, and transformation. He believes he can remake people into their truer, darker selves. Sherlock’s philosophy is one of cold, hard logic. He believes the world is built on facts and patterns, and emotion is a distorting lens. It’s a powerful ideology, but it’s not explored with the same explicit philosophical weight as Hannibal’s. Hannibal’s philosophy is the subject of the story. Point to Lecter.

**IDEOLOGY (SHERLOCK 2: HANNIBAL 7)**

Hannibal’s entire existence is an ideology. It is an aesthetic and moral code built on the principle that he is above the rules of society, which he views as a herd of boring cattle. His ""killing the rude"" is a consistent, warped ideology that drives his actions. Sherlock’s ideology is justice, but it’s a cooler, more detached one. He is fascinated by the puzzle, with justice often being the satisfying byproduct. Hannibal’s personal creed is more coherent, active, and central to his character. He takes this.

**SELF-VIEW (SHERLOCK 3: HANNIBAL 7)**

Sherlock, especially in the BBC series, is acutely aware of being a ""high-functioning sociopath"" and a terrible person. He uses it as a shield, but he knows the damage he causes. Hannibal Lecter has no such guilt. His self-view is one of godlike superiority. He doesn’t see himself as a monster, but as an evolved being. Sherlock’s self-awareness, his acknowledgement of his own flaws, gives him a more complex and relatable self-view. Sherlock knows how terrible he is; Hannibal thinks he’s perfect. Point to Holmes.

**WORLDVIEW (SHERLOCK 3: HANNIBAL 8)**

Hannibal’s worldview is simply more developed and central. He is a predator looking at a world of sheep. He is endlessly curious about humanity, but from a position of supreme otherness. In NBC TV hannibal, he did every shitty stuffs because he is curious. He sees the world as his pantry and his canvas. Sherlock sees the world as a chaotic system that can be understood through logic. It’s a brilliant worldview, but Hannibal’s is more unique, more extreme, and more integral to every action he takes. Hannibal is just curious about humanity and does shits, and that is his worldview. He takes it.

**BEST EPISODE (SHERLOCK 4: HANNIBAL 9)**

This is a actually peakism combat. Sherlock’s ""The Reichenbach Fall"" is a masterpiece of tension, tragedy, and mystery, in fact this might be one of my favorite episodes ever in tv. the moriarty arc is so peak, the talk in Baker Street when they were both siping hot milk coffee while showing off their iq just bring the insane hype, and the combat of wits though maybe less logical than Hannibal's , but takes enjoyability way more.  Hannibal’s ""Mizumono"" is arguably the most perfectly crafted, emotionally devastating episode of television in the 21st century. It is a Shakespearean tragedy in 42 minutes. The final 15 minutes—the betrayal, the blood-soaked kitchen fight, the heartbreaking final line (""I let you know me. See me."")—is an unparalleled peak. ""Mizumono"" is a rare gift. i think it is a tie to be real honest.

**BEST SEASON (SHERLOCK 4: HANNIBAL 10)**

Hannibal’s second season, season 2 is the best season 2 in tv history.

**BEST BOOK (SHERLOCK 4: HANNIBAL 11)**

The Silence of the Lambs is better than every single book in the Holmes canon. While the Holmes stories are foundational and brilliant, Silence is a perfect novel—a tight, terrifying, and psychologically profound thriller that transcends its genre. The character of Hannibal Lecter, even in limited pages, is arguably the most iconic villain in literary history. Clean sweep. though I may be biased because I like the movies, I dislike red dragon and hannibal rising tv for some reason, but that doesn't affect his writing.

**STORY (SHERLOCK 5: HANNIBAL 11)**

Sherlock takes this with his many epic arcs. The slow build of Professor Moriarty as a nemesis across multiple stories is legendary. The modern series gave us the epic Irene Adler scandal, the fall, the return, and the Eurus saga. The sheer volume and variety of classic mysteries—from Hound of the Baskervilles to the Speckled Band—creates a richer, more expansive story world. Hannibal’s story is a focused, intense descent into a relationship. For epic scope and narrative legacy, Sherlock wins.

**CONFLICTS (SHERLOCK 5: HANNIBAL 12)**

Sherlock dominates external conflicts (vs. Moriarty, vs. the criminal underworld). Hannibal dominates internal and interpersonal conflicts (his psychological war with Will Graham, his internal struggle between his civilized mask and his monstrous nature). Since both are awarded a point, the score reflects both strengths. Hannibal’s conflicts are just more psychologically layered.

**SPEECHES/QUOTES (SHERLOCK 5: HANNIBAL 13)**

Hannibal Lecter is a quote machine. ""A census taker once tried to test me..."" ""We are God's terrible angels."" ""When life becomes maddeningly polite, think of me."" His dialogue is endlessly quotable. Sherlock has brilliant lines (""You see, but you do not observe,"" ""The game is afoot!""), but they are more functional. Hannibal’s speeches are poetic, terrifying, and memorable. This category belongs to the cannibal.

**HIGHEST PEAK & OVERALL PEAKS (SHERLOCK 6: HANNIBAL 14)**

Highest Peak: ""Mizumono"" is a rarer, more devastating emotional and narrative peak than even Sherlock's fall from the roof.

Overall Peaks: Sherlock has more frequent, puzzle-box peaks of intellectual satisfaction. But Hannibal’s peaks—the mushroom garden reveal, the courtroom ""This is my design"" scene, the Florence arc, the Dragon finale—are operatic, philosophical, and visceral. could be a tie, but sherlock wins here due to the quantity

**EMOTION (SHERLOCK 6: HANNIBAL 15)**

A Tie? No. Hannibal’s story is fundamentally more emotional. It is a dark, twisted, but deeply passionate story about obsession, love, and the intimacy of being truly seen by another person. The relationship between Will and Hannibal is one of the most emotionally charged dynamics ever put on screen. Sherlock’s stories are thrilling and clever, but they are not primarily driven by raw emotion. Point to Hannibal.

**RELATABILITY (SHERLOCK 7: HANNIBAL 15)**

Obviously, neither is relatable. But Sherlock’s struggle with social connection, his boredom with mundane life, and his desire to be seen as brilliant are more human flaws. Hannibal is an alien predator. Sherlock, for all his genius, is more recognizably human. Point to Holmes.

**SYMBOLISM (SHERLOCK 7: HANNIBAL 16)**

Hannibal in NBC is the best symbolism on television. Every murder tableau is a Renaissance painting with deep meaning. The stag represents Will’s obsession. The pendulum swings. The entire show is a sustained piece of visual and thematic art. Sherlock uses symbolism (the hound as a myth, the fall as redemption), but it is not the primary language of the narrative. Hannibal’s world is built on it. Easy point.

**DEVELOPMENT & JOURNEY (SHERLOCK 8: HANNIBAL 17)**

Development (Hannibal): Does he change? He allows himself to love Will, to be vulnerable. His journey is towards connection, however monstrous.

Journey (Sherlock): His journey is from a detached machine to a man who understands and values the ""golden thread"" of his friends.

Hannibal’s development is more shocking and profound—a monster learning to feel something akin to love. Sherlock’s journey is more conventional hero development. Hannibal takes both.

**MAIN DYNAMIC & OVERALL DYNAMICS (SHERLOCK 9: HANNIBAL 18)**

Main Dynamic: Hannibal & Will Graham is the most complex, intimate, and destructive relationship in this genre. It is the core of the story. Sherlock & Watson is iconic and wonderful, but it is a partnership. Hannibal & Will is a fusion. Hannibal & Will > Sherlock & John.

Overall Dynamics: Sherlock’s dynamics with Mycroft, Moriarty, and Irene Adler are fantastic, but Hannibal’s are more psychologically intense. Point to Lecter.

**PSYCHOLOGY (SHERLOCK 9: HANNIBAL 19)**

Hannibal Lecter is a psychiatrist. The entire narrative is a deep dive into forensic psychology and the psyche of a monster. He is the category. Sherlock is a master of observation and deduction, which is a cognitive science, but it’s not the deep, clinical psychology of Hannibal. This was never a contest.

**ENJOYABILITY (SHERLOCK 9: HANNIBAL 20)**

This is very debatable. Sherlock is a more traditionally enjoyable romp—a brilliant detective solving clever puzzles. It’s fun, witty, and thrilling. Hannibal is a dense, violent, psychologically taxing horror show. It is a masterpiece, but it is not for everyone. For sheer, accessible enjoyability, Sherlock takes it.

I**MPACT (SHERLOCK 11: HANNIBAL 20)**

world impact? sherlock low diffs prob.

personal impact? Sherlock's more likable to me, so sherlock prob.

so 2 pts for Sherlock

An elderly woman (I'd say at the least late 70s, could be mid 80s) comes in with her walker every day and sits at her preferred seat. She is often on the phone to family abroad but I think she lives here in my city alone.

Here's the issue: I think she needs help with her laundry and possibly bathing. There is a pretty bad stench coming from her that I don't want to blame her for, but it makes being near her hard. I think she might also have some cognitive decline setting in as she often re-asks the cashier questions after he's answered them already, or forgets if she paid or not, etc. She usually stays for a couple hours and then goes home.

I don't know how to broach such a delicate subject. It seems obvious that with her physical limits she probably can't be schlepping laundry, and perhaps can't hire help either. Even if she knows it's an issue I don't know how much she can do about it. I've also seen her be kind of snappy and abrasive in conversations with others so I feel like it would be a landmine. (I'm a woman in her 40s so she might see it as intrusion from a younger person as well).

Thoughts? Just suck it up since she's so old? Since it's also a sustained thing she'd need help with, I'm not sure how to offer help that would actually benefit her over the long term.",1,1760455246.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

The fire crackled weakly, its warmth barely touching the numbing cold creeping into Tyler’s limbs. He sat hunched on a stool inside the tent, his fingers trembling—not from the cold, but from excitement.

He pulled open his system window and stared at it. For a long while, his finger hovered over the \[Attribute Points\] tab.

\[Remaining Attribute Points: 18\]

“Alright,” he whispered to himself. “Time to stop hoarding and start investing.”

He took a deep breath and began allocating points. He didn’t want to be a one-trick pony who dumped everything into either \[Attack\] or \[Defence\] anymore. After careful calculations, he made his choices.

\[Power Regen: +9\]

\[Defence: +5\]

\[Speed: +2\]

\[Agility: +2\]

\[Player: Tyler\] \[Level 44\]

\[HP: 250/250\] \[PE: 25/25\]

Stats:

\> Attack: 15 (+10)

\> Defence: 10 (+20)

\> Agility: 4

\> Speed: 4

\> Power Regen: 15

\> Accuracy: 1

\> Dodge: 1

\> Health Regen: 1

Remaining Attribute Points: 0

“Not bad,” he muttered, his breath fogging in the cold. “This should balance me out better.”

Tyler thought about his fighting style and the enemies he had faced so far. He’d defeated two sub-bosses now, each with their own battlefield advantages and high HP, but neither had felt as terrifying as that absurd Rhino Momma. She hadn’t even been a sub-boss, and yet she left him helpless the first time they met. He shuddered, recalling the sheer physical power she had.

“Why the hell was she so strong?” he whispered, clenching his fist.

That encounter had taught him a brutal lesson. It wasn’t just levels or skills that made an enemy dangerous. The very nature of the creature mattered. Defensive-type beings like Milo or that rhino naturally came with high HP, strong resistances, and abilities built for endurance and overwhelming counterattacks.

And Tyler? He was a human. No animal traits. No inherent strengths or weaknesses. It made him versatile, sure, but also average. If he wanted to stand toe-to-toe with beasts like that, he had to grow smarter, stronger, more adaptable.

He had leaned into the role of a damage-dealer ever since learning \[Rage\], but he was already imagining how future skills might change his role again. The road to becoming the strongest wasn’t a straight path. He would have to reshape himself again and again.

The tent flap rustled open.

Milo stepped in, face red from the cold, arms full of foraged goods. He set them down and shook the snow off his cloak. “Phew! That blizzard’s not letting up. But look what I found!”

He held up a bundle of berries.

“Cloudberries from the upper ridge and some moonberries I picked earlier. These cloudberries taste really sweet, and moonberries can be brewed into Vision Enhancement potions!”

“Vision enhancement?” Tyler asked, raising an eyebrow.

Milo nodded eagerly. “Yeah! You drink it, and your range of sight doubles. It’s like having a 360-degree drone camera hovering around you.”

Tyler snorted. “Pfft. I don’t need that.”

\[Acquired Runestone — Eagle Eye\]

\[Skill: Eagle Eye\]

\[Description: Increases range of vision to twice as far. Increases Accuracy by twice for 5 seconds. PE Cost: 7\]

Tyler grinned as the system message flashed. “See? The world provides.”

Milo pouted. “Man, you’re really starting to collect a whole set of skills. I’m stuck with two. Not fair.”

“That’s the difference between a player and a companion,” Tyler said with a wink. “Let’s rest up. We still have a long way to climb.”

They sat quietly for a while, the blizzard outside intensifying. Visibility had dropped to mere meters. Milo sipped some warm coffee, made from the coffee beans they had bought beforehand, offering Tyler some, who declined.

“You know,” Milo said, staring at the tent wall, “we could just skirt around the mountain and take the longer route. Might be safer.”

Tyler shook his head. “That’s not who I am.”

Milo sighed. “Yeah. Figured.”

They stepped out of the tent the next morning. The wind hadn’t died down, and the snowfall had only grown heavier. Still, they climbed.

Days passed. They encountered goat-bear mobs along the way — tough, but manageable. Milo handled most of them with practiced ease, his skillset perfect for stalling and controlling enemies in this harsh terrain. By the time they reached the upper ridges, Milo had climbed to Level 27.

\[Level Up! Milo Level 24 → Level 27\]

Finally, after enduring the harshest leg of their climb, they broke through the final wall of howling winds.

The world changed.

Above the clouds now, the sky shone a brilliant azure. Sunlight bathed everything in golden warmth, and at the summit stood a palace-like structure — an ethereal vision made of white marble, its domes gleaming.

\[Entering Sanctuary: Skyreach Monastery\]

They approached the structure, each step echoing against the polished stone beneath their feet. Carvings and wind-blown patterns adorned the pillars, murals of winged beings and swirling gales painted the high arched ceilings.

At the end of the long corridor, they entered what appeared to be the innermost sanctum. And there, sitting gracefully atop a throne carved from crystal and stone, was an entity that radiated peace.

The air felt different here — calmer, sacred.

The being opened its eyes.

“Greetings, \[Player\],” it said in a serene voice. “Congratulations on being the first to reach this sanctuary since the day it was created. I am Zephryn, the Warden of Whispering Winds, one of the Five Primordial Beasts, blessed by the Creator God — Aether Dragon.”

Tyler’s breath caught. Whatever he had expected — it wasn’t this.

1o6i2na,https://www.reddit.com/r/CopywritingAdvices/comments/1o6i2na/client_acquisition_that_actually_works/,Client Acquisition That Actually Works,"# Positioning & Profile Architecture (LinkedIn + Instagram)

When someone lands on your profile, they’ve got about three seconds before their brain decides whether you’re worth their time or just another noise-maker in an already crowded feed.

Visual chaos translates directly to professional chaos in their mind. Four different fonts and six competing colors? That’s not creativity — that’s confusion.

* Your profile photo needs to be clean.
* First-person perspective, proper lighting, and a background that doesn’t scream “I took this in my closet.”
* Everything should appear perfectly harmonious.

The bio formula is straightforward: make it immediately clear who you help, what transformation you deliver, and how you do it.

**The Formula: I** ***Help \[TARGET\] to \[RESULT\] with \[SERVICE/METHOD\]*****.**

You don’t need to follow this robotically, but these three elements must emerge within the first two lines.

You've already lost if I’m scrolling and can’t figure out whether you’re relevant to me.

Always include a link—Calendly, a custom booking page, or even a Tally form if you’re testing qualification approaches. The point is to give people a frictionless next step when they’re ready.

Here’s something most people get wrong about niching: you don’t need to box yourself into one vertical unless you have a damn good reason.

Real case studies, an existing network in that space, and direct experience are the reasons.

“I heard I should pick a niche” is not.

I run a strategic positioning on LinkedIn that’s deliberately horizontal while keeping Instagram focused exclusively on coaches and course creators. It’s the same core expertise expressed through different apertures.

**Don’t artificially limit yourself based on someone else’s playbook.**

# The Outreach Rhythm That Compounds

If you’re serious about building a client pipeline, you need to treat prospecting like the non-negotiable it is.

Before you send a single message, you need to observe.

Follow your potential clients/leads for seven to ten days.

Watch their stories, read their posts, see where they’re getting traction and where they’re struggling.

* The point isn’t to stalk them — it’s to find a legitimate hook that makes your outreach feel less like a cold pitch and more like a natural extension of an existing conversation.

Twenty-five new prospects (people you will contact) per week is the baseline. That breaks down to five per day if you’re working a standard Job, but honestly, once you’ve got your system down, you can knock out five quality touches in under an hour.

Your response rate is your truth meter. If you’re not getting at least 20–30% of people to reply, something’s broken. Either your targeting is off, your messaging is generic, or you’re leading with your offer instead of with value.

# Messages That Open Real Conversations

The interactions that actually convert aren’t built on flattery. They’re built on specific knowledge — something you noticed, something you can help with, something that positions you as a peer rather than a fan.

The three-beat structure is as follows:

* Start with a specific hook tied to something real they posted or said.
* Follow immediately with tangible value — a technical observation, a quick fix, or a strategic insight they can use right now.
* Close with a soft question or invitation that keeps the door open without forcing them through it.

Let me show you what doesn’t work.

I recently watched someone reach out to a nutritionist with this gem: “Really interesting content, congrats! Quick question — do you focus more on taste or nutritional value in your recipes?”

The nutritionist replied with “Both 🙂” and that was the end of it.

The message was polite, inoffensive, and completely forgettable. It didn’t give the nutritionist any reason to keep talking.

Now here’s what actually works.

I was following a SaaS founder who posted about switching their tech stack to Notion. I’d been in their position six months earlier.

I sent them a message: “Saw you’re moving everything into Notion — been there. The database relations are where most people get stuck. I built a client CRM template that handles the messy parts automatically. Two-minute setup. Want me to send it over?”

They replied in four minutes. We ended up on a call three days later. Why?

Because I led with something useful, positioned myself as someone who’d solved the same problem, and made the ask so low-friction they’d be stupid to say no.

Here’s another angle.

I’m watching a venture capital partner on LinkedIn who just published a breakdown of their investment thesis around AI tooling. I use three of the tools she mentioned daily.

I drop a comment on the post: “Sharp framework — especially the distribution velocity metric. We’ve been tracking similar patterns with our portfolio’s go-to-market execution.”

Then I slide into DMs: “Just commented on your AI thesis post. The distribution velocity angle is something we’re obsessing over right now. Curious — have you seen anyone successfully compress that 6–12 month adoption curve? We’ve got one client doing it in 90 days and I’m still trying to reverse-engineer how.”

Zero sales pressure. Professional to professional. They either engage because they’re genuinely curious, or they don’t — but either way, I’ve positioned myself as someone operating at their level.

**Critical point:** outreach isn’t about following a script. It’s about finding the most natural entry point into someone’s world.

If I’m based in Austin and I see a story from a fintech founder who’s also in Austin and just posted about the new coffee shop on South Congress, sometimes the best opener is just: “Just saw your story — is that the new place next to HomeSlice? Been meaning to check it out.”

Conversation unlocked. From there, it can evolve a thousand different ways, but the chat’s open and it happened naturally.

What kills these conversations are fake questions.

“How long have you been doing this?”

“Do you work more with individuals or businesses?”

These aren’t real questions — they’re interview fillers, and everyone can smell them from a mile away.

# You’re talking to a peer, not pitching to a prospect. The frame should always be: we’re two professionals discussing something we both care about. Not fan to creator. Not vendor to buyer. Peer to peer.

This means you should drop the deferential language immediately.

“If it would be convenient for you” and “whenever you have a moment” position you below them.

**You’re not below them.**

**You’re bringing value to the table. Speak like it.**

Pick topics where you actually have depth.

If you open with a strategic observation, make sure you can back it up with three more layers if they engage. Surface-level compliments followed by nothing substantial? That’s worse than not reaching out at all.

# Prospect Research & Competitive Intelligence

Every good message starts with good research. Before you reach out, you need to understand what they’ve already tried, what’s working, and where the friction points are.

* Study their bio.
* Look at their pinned stories.
* Map their funnel from awareness to conversion.
* Where does it break? Where does the prospect get confused or lose momentum?

These friction points are your entry opportunities.

When analysing competitors or reference accounts, don’t just steal their tactics. Understand why they work. What psychological lever are they pulling? What objection are they preemptively handling? What context makes this format effective for this audience? That understanding lets you adapt and improve, rather than copy and hope.

If you’re not tracking, you’re just hoping. And hope is not a client acquisition strategy.",1,1760454463.0,CopywritingAdvices,1,1.0,False

But then I like to play video games at night, I’m someone that sleeps late, I can’t really sleep early and she wants me to sleep early, but then I end up in bed scrolling for two hours before I can fall asleep.

1o6i0i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotelDupes/comments/1o6i0i0/spa_vibes_at_home_the_best_hotel_dupe_robes_you/,Spa vibes at home: the best hotel dupe robes you can buy anywhere,"I recently realized that I’m in my robe era. It started with one hotel stay where I “accidentally” wore the robe to breakfast (because it was so freaking comfortable and it didn’t occur to me to, you know, put on actual clothes). 

And now here we are where I have to confess that I own more robes than jeans, and I have opinions about what the best hotel dupe robes are.

If you want that cozy, spa-like feeling without paying resort prices or calling down for housekeeping, these are the robes that actually nail the hotel vibe.

**1. Miracle Brand Antimicrobial Gauze Robe** 

This one surprised me. Out of the box, it felt almost too light, but after the first wash, it softened up and, suddenly, it was my go-to. 

The gauze breathes and I can wear it in summer without overheating. It still feels cozy enough in winter with slippers. Bonus: it’s silver treated to be antimicrobial, so it doesn’t get that weird damp smell if you wear it too many mornings in a row.

**2. Brooklinen Super-Plush Robe**

This is like stepping into the hotel towel closet and not leaving. It’s so thick it practically stands up on its own, which is heavenly after a hot shower but a little much if your bathroom already runs warm. 

I love the oversized cuffs and pockets since it feels intentional instead of bulky. It’s a great “weekend morning, make coffee, and journal for too long” robe.

**3. Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe**

I didn’t want to believe the hype on this one (Oprah’s favorite, yada yada), but it is ridiculously soft. The fabric feels more like a blanket you wear, which means it’s cozy but not very absorbent. 

This one’s perfect for Netflix marathons or when you want to feel like you’re being hugged. Not for post-shower drying, but unmatched for “living room luxury.”

**4. Quince Mongolian Cashmere Robe**

This one feels like wearing a cashmere sweater dress in robe form. It’s not oversized and slouchy; it’s more drapey and elegant. 

The texture is buttery soft, but cashmere means you need to baby it a little more than fleece. It’s great for when you want to feel put-together even if you’re half-asleep. 

**5. L.L. Bean Winter Fleece Wrap-Front Robe**

This robe is basically a fleece blanket with sleeves, but cut so it actually stays on your body. It hits long, just above the ankle, and traps heat like nothing else. On mornings when I can see my breath in the kitchen, this is the only one I’ll put on. The fleece is surprisingly breathable, so you’re warm without sweating. Practical, cozy, no-frills.

**6. PeachyMink x PeachSkinSheets Luxury Faux Mink Robe**

This robe is dramatic in the best way. It’s heavy, plush, and has an oversized hood that makes you feel like you’re in a movie. 

I wouldn’t wear it right after a shower (it’s too weighty), but for lounging or even throwing on over leggings to answer the door, it feels luxurious. It’s less “robe” and more “statement piece disguised as loungewear.”

**7. NY Threads Shawl Collar Fleece Bathrobe**

I expected this one to feel cheap because of the price (under $30), but it’s shockingly comfortable. The fleece is soft right away, and there’s no stiff break-in period. 

It’s warm but not suffocating, and the shawl collar gives it a slightly more polished look than the average budget robe. It's a great one to keep on hand for guests. 

**8. Parachute Classic Turkish Cotton Robe**

This is the robe blueprint. Thick terry cotton that soaks up water, a simple shawl collar, and that satisfying heft when you put it on. 

It’s the one to grab when you want the exact hotel bathroom vibe: white tiles, fluffy towels, room service fantasy. It’s not flashy, but it nails the feeling that started this whole robe obsession for me.

**How to pick your “checked-in, chilling” robe (without overthinking it)**

Robes are like relationships. The wrong one looks great online but makes you sweaty and annoyed in real life. 

But the right one fits without fuss and makes you feel comfortable in your own skin. That’s the kind of commitment we’re talking about here. 

* Figure out your vibe. Terry is that classic spa moment. Gauze is the “I have plants and a pour-over” vibe. Faux mink is full cocoon mode. Cashmere is, well, cashmere.
* Think about your climate. If you live somewhere warm, don’t let the siren song of fleece fool you; you’ll regret it. Cold apartment folks, fleece is your only friend.
* Length matters. Mid-calf is robe heaven. Any longer and you’re tripping down the hallway. Any shorter and you’re flashing the UPS driver.
* Freshness factor. Daily robe-wearers: antimicrobial fabrics save you from that questionable “when’s the last time I washed this?” moment.
* Sizing isn’t just numbers. Gauze shrinks. Plush runs huge. If you want blanket-energy, size up. If you don’t want to look like a kid playing dress-up, maybe don’t.

**So what’s the best hotel dupe robe you can buy anywhere?**

If you want that hotel-fresh feeling every day, start with the Miracle Brand Antimicrobial Gauze Robe, which is light, breathable, and stays fresher between washes. 

For plush comfort, go Brooklinen Super-Plush; for true warmth, L.L. Bean Winter Fleece. 

Gifting? Quince Cashmere or Barefoot Dreams nail the luxe vibe. And if you want the spa classic blueprint, Parachute Turkish Terry wins.

So, what’s your hotel-robe dupe? Drop your pick (and how you sized it) below. Future robe gremlins will be so grateful.

I have a Breville Impress Express or whatever that's called. It has tamp included in the unit. I'm trying to get more precise with how much I grind and extract. I understand that I need a different setup for more control but that's currently not possible. 

So the issue here is that I want to use 18g of ground coffee. When the machine grinds and dispenses that it spills almost 4g if I try to remove the portafilter without using the tamp lever so that I can muck around with a distribution tool and wdt tool before tamping. I suppose a simple solution is to grind into a container, transfer to portafilter, do the wdt stuff and manually tamp.

1o6hxnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1o6hxnx/can_incredible_ayestar_stain_remover_handle_tough/,Can Incredible Ayestar Stain Remover Handle Tough Spots? Honest Review on Carpet Cleaning,"Testing products like the INCREDIBLE! Ayestar Stain Remover daily has truly transformed how I handle accidental spills and stubborn stains. With a household that includes an energetic dog, a coffee-loving spouse, and, occasionally, my clumsy self spilling red wine, finding a cleaner that can tackle all these challenges effectively has been a game-changer.

**Design and Usability**  
The sleek bottle design is user-friendly and ergonomic, making it easy to handle, even when you're in a rush to clean a freshly spilled mess. The nozzle spray mechanism dispenses just the right amount, ensuring you don't over-soak the affected area. Its application process genuinely takes minimal effort—there’s no complicated washing or intense scrubbing involved. You simply spray, blot, and watch the stain begin to vanish. As someone who has spent what feels like hours scrubbing pet accidents out of carpets in the past, this product really feels like an upgrade I didn’t know I needed.

**Highlights**  
- Effortless one-step process for stain removal—no rinsing required.  
- Safe, non-irritating water-based formula suitable for kids and pets.  
- Versatility across various surfaces, including upholstery, mattresses, and clothes.

**Performance on Stains**  
This stain remover promises to tackle new and old stains alike, and it completely delivers on its claims. I tested it on fresh stains like coffee and wine spills—gone within minutes with just some light blotting. I even experimented with older stains on a couch cushion (because, yes, not all pet accidents are spotted instantly). With a slightly longer soaking time as per the bottle’s instructions, even those faded into oblivion. Knowing it can tackle sweat stains on clothing just as effectively is a massive bonus for me when laundering garments.

**Pros**  
- Works on a wide range of stains, from greasy food splatters to pet-related mishaps.  
- Odor-neutralizing properties—no lingering chemical smells or unpleasant scents.  
- Suitable for both old and new stains, making it genuinely versatile.  

**Potential Critiques**  
- While the spray nozzle is mostly practical, it doesn’t allow for super narrow precision. Cleaner application on smaller areas can be tricky.  
- Not ideal for larger floor spills as the spray quantity may require frequent refills for extensive use.  
- Instructions could elaborate a bit more for trickier, set-in stains to avoid trial-and-error.

**Safety for Families and Households**  
One of the most reassuring aspects of using this product has to be its non-toxic formula. I don’t have to worry about harsh fumes affecting my dog or anyone else in the house. Its water-based, non-flammable composition has been gentle enough that even with daily use, it hasn't faded or damaged any fabric or surface. For a parent or pet owner, this peace of mind goes a long way.

**Product Comparisons**  
In the past, I’ve used popular alternatives like Nature’s Miracle and Resolve Carpet Cleaner. While those worked decently on pet stains or carpets solely, they didn't offer the versatility this product brings. INCREDIBLE! Ayestar Stain Remover works equally well on upholstery, clothes, and even mattresses—meaning it has reduced my reliance on multiple cleaning products. However, where competitors like Nature’s Miracle slightly outshine is in their odor specific treatments (e.g., enzyme-based sprays for urine), but they lack the spotless finish this product leaves behind.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given the wide range of uses this cleaner offers, it’s undoubtedly a smart buy. Instead of purchasing separate products for carpets, upholstery, laundry, and mattresses, this stain remover consolidates everything into one affordable solution. Compared to most specialized cleaners that focus on specific stains or surfaces, this one saves both time and money. For its ease of use combined with effectiveness, I truly believe it’s worth every penny invested.

Entrambe le categorie commettono numerose infrazioni, con la differenza che chi guida un suv da 2,5 tonnellate ma anche un'utilitaria da una tonnellata è molto più pericoloso della stessa identica persona quando va in bicicletta. [Un’auto che a 50 km/h investe un pedone ha un impatto pari a circa cento ciclisti che vanno a 20 km/h](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/essere-investiti-da-unauto-a-50-km-h-e-come-essere-investiti-da-tutto-il-plotone-del-giro-ditalia/).

Il punto importante è che ci sono molte categorie di ciclisti, illustrate nell’immagine sopra, e cioè:

1. **Ciclista quotidiano.** È il ciclista, uomo o donna, che usa tutti i giorni la bici per andare al lavoro, a scuola e per fare commissioni familiari. Si va dall’impiegato che lavora dalle 9 alle 18 [all’agente di commercio](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/09/18/lagente-di-commercio-che-fa-50-km-ogni-giorno-in-bicicletta-elettrica/) che visita numerosi clienti tutti i giorni, dallo studente all’insegnante.
2. **Ciclista sportivo.** È il ciclista che usa la bicicletta per allenamento sportivo, professionale, semiprofessionale o amatoriale, ma anche per esplorare i dintorni della sua città, facendo spesso centinaia di km alla settimana. Di questa categoria fanno parte anche i paraciclisti che si allenano con biciclette speciali. Il codice della strada italiano è particolarmente impietoso nei suoi confronti, con una normativa particolarmente confusa sia a proposito dei [gruppi](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/codice-della-strada-lart-182-comma-1-e-contraddittorio-pericoloso-scritto-male/), sia a proposito delle [piste ciclabli](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/quiz-i-ciclisti-sono-sempre-obbligati-ad-usare-le-piste-ciclabili-e-ciclopedonali/).
3. **Ciclista del tempo libero.** Chi usa la bici per fare un giro, per andare al caffè, uscire la sera o passare un pomeriggio festivo, tanto nella propria città quanto in vacanza
4. **Ciclista attento.** È il ciclista che vuole circolare in sicurezza, desidera seguire le regole del codice (che però in italia sono spesso [confuse](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/codice-della-strada-lart-182-comma-1-e-contraddittorio-pericoloso-scritto-male/), contraddittorie e [controproducenti](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/12/20/perche-la-norma-dei-gilet-riflettenti-per-ciclisti-e-assurda-e-vessatoria/)) e ha bisogno di segnaletica chiara e intersezioni sicure. È il ciclista che più facilmente rinuncia alla bicicletta se pensa di essere in una situazione di pericolo. Spesso [le donne preferiscono non usare la bicicletta](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/12/30/come-sarebbe-una-citta-progettata-dalle-donne-bbc-video/) se pensano che gli automobilisti siano troppo pericolosi e aggressivi. Molti italiani vorrebbero usare la bicicletta per lavoro o per commissioni, ma non lo fa perché ha paura del traffico.
5. **Ciclista vulnerabile.** Si tratta principalmente di bambini, [disabili](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/ma-e-gli-anziani-e-i-disabili-come-fanno-ad-andare-in-bicicletta/) con bici a due o tre ruote, e [anziani](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/perche-tutti-tutelano-gli-anziani-costretti-a-usare-lauto-per-andare-in-farmacia-o-in-parrocchia-ma-nessuno-tutela-gli-anziani-in-bicicletta/), sempre con bici a due o tre ruote. Hanno bisogno di percorsi particolarmente sicuri, e particolare rispetto da parte degli utenti motorizzati.
6. **Corrieri in bici.** Sono persone che lavorano in bici per fare consegne o per trasportare la propria attrezzatura: corrieri, fattorini, postini, [artigiani](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/06/19/si-puo-fare-lidraulico-in-bicicletta-e-senza-furgone-a-roma-si/), [tuttofare](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/alessandria-il-caso-dellartigiano-aggiustatutto-con-la-cargo-bike-che-lavora-e-vive-meglio-senza-furgone/) in bicicletta. Da notare che, mentre i corrieri con furgone quando parcheggiano sui marciapiedi, in doppia fila o sulle piste ciclabili sono sempre giustificati con ‘solo cinque minuti, sto lavorando’, i corrieri in bici vengono spesso etichettati come delinquenti che non rispettano il codice della strada. Come mai questo doppio standard?
7. **I** **cicloturisti**. Categoria non prevista nell’illustrazione sopra, sta diventando sempre più importante in Europa anche per [il giro d’affari che comincia a muovere](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/miliardi-di-euro-per-il-cicloturismo-in-europa-e-in-italia/). I cicloturisti viaggiano spesso in gruppo, hanno spesso bisogno di usare anche il treno, e hanno bisogno di servizi e assistenza lungo la strada. Fortunatamente molti alberghi si stanno attrezzando per servire al meglio questo tipo di clientela che, in proporzione, spende di più e pesa di meno sul territorio rispetto agli ingombranti turisti in automobile. [I cicloturisti si suddividono a loro volta in almeno tre categorie](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2021/04/11/ci-sono-3-tipi-di-cicloturisti-e-molti-albergatori-non-lo-sanno-perdendo-clienti/).

È evidente che queste sette categorie di ciclisti hanno caratteristiche particolari e hanno bisogno di una attenzione specifica da parte delle amministrazioni pubbliche, delle aziende, delle scuole e anche un’attenzione particolare da parte di chi guida mezzi motore. [I ciclisti, per il codice della strada, sono utenti vulnerabili, come pedoni e disabili](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/la-bici-e-un-veicolo-ma-il-ciclista-e-un-utente-debole-come-pedoni-e-disabili/).

È altrettanto evidente che è del tutto inutile e anche stupido dipingere sempre i ciclisti come anarchici che non rispettano il codice della strada. Nessuna delle categorie di utenti della strada rispetta tutte le norme: gli automobilisti fanno le loro infrazioni, i motociclisti le loro infrazioni, i pedoni le loro infrazioni e i ciclisti le loro infrazioni. Non è con l’invito astratto a rispettare il codice della strada che si riducono gli incidenti, ma riprogettando le strade, realizzando più piste ciclabili e potenziando i mezzi pubblici.

È invece utile progettare strade sicure anche per queste categorie di ciclisti, che pesano meno su ambiente e territorio ma portano più benessere e una mobilità migliore.

Quando una città è progettata per bambini, pedoni, ciclisti è meglio per tutti, compresi gli automobilisti. Quando una città è progettata prioritariamente per l’automobile, con autostrade urbane e parcheggi dappertutto, è peggio per tutti, compresi gli automobilisti.

I'm just transitioning into Stage 8 and I have started taking medication whose side effects include lowering blood pressure. I've always had low blood pressure, so I thought it must be that my body is pumping me full of adrenaline to raise my blood pressure, but tracking my blood pressure shows that it is not actually too low but in the optimal range. 

I've also noticed that it is especially bad after coffee. I usually start the day with an espresso, then another one half an hour later. One at lunch. One at supper. 

I've always found this to be energizing, but now I'm wondering whether this might simply be my improved **interoception** back firing.

I've become much more chill and relaxed during the day since I started meditating in earnest and I've made much faster progress than I thought possible, so I've got no real benchmarks to go on any more.

1o6hi01,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdminAssistant/comments/1o6hi01/my_admin_assistant_job_turned_into_being_the/,"My Admin Assistant job turned into being the receptionist, and I feel stuck","I am three months into my first job after college as an Administrative Assistant. The job description I applied to listed typical admin duties like scheduling, records, and project support. After I signed my offer, they told me I would also be at the front desk. I thought it would just be a small part of my job, but it has completely taken over, and now I feel like I was hired to be a receptionist without being told.

Today really drove it home for me. We had a company breakfast, and I stayed for maybe 5 to 10 minutes to grab food and finally socialize with people. My manager came over and politely asked me to head back and watch the door. It stung, because I already miss so many meetings and events since someone has to be at the front, and that person is always me. The one time I tried to stay, I was reminded I cannot.

People sometimes say they will cover for me, but the second they get busy they leave, and I end up being responsible again. Even when I just need to use the bathroom, no one actually stays to cover. It feels like I cannot say anything about it, so I just quietly deal with being stuck while everyone else builds connections, chats at the coffee cooler, and works on projects. Meanwhile, I am expected to answer every call immediately, greet everyone who walks in, handle deliveries, and keep the door monitored at all times.

My job is Administrative Assistant, but in reality I am expected to do both that role and the receptionist role. It is hard when I am the only one at the front and people do not take me seriously. I know that is the reality of being at the front desk, and I am working on growing a thicker skin and letting things roll off my back. In a way, I am grateful because it is making me a stronger person. But the truth is I have almost no support.

Part of the reason I am always tied to the front is because our office door does not fully close, meaning anyone can walk in when it is supposed to be locked. We are not in a safe area and have had homeless people try to barge in. I have talked to my office manager three or four times about how unsafe I feel, and she always says it will be fixed, but nothing ever happens. They do not want to upgrade the door or hire security. So instead, the solution has been that my young self, as a woman, has to sit there and make sure it is secure. They told me that as long as I am up there, we are safe. That does not feel fair, especially since I cannot count on anyone to watch the door when I step away, and yet I am still expected to do my other admin duties on top of it.

I know everyone says your first job after college is supposed to be bad, and I do not want to be the stereotypical Gen Z worker who complains about wanting more than I deserve. But I honestly do not know how people do this long term. I feel invisible and incredibly lonely, and I do not see any growth here. I know one person who broke out of this role into an Office Administrator position, but that only happens every five to ten years, and I cannot wait around that long.

I know the future is unpredictable and sometimes opportunities open up unexpectedly, but right now it feels like a dead end. I want to make connections and grow my career, but here I feel like I will always be viewed as the receptionist. I really do want to stick it out, but it is so hard. I do not want to give up since this is my first job, and I am doing everything I can to be good at it. I put on a smile, stay friendly, answer calls as quickly as possible, and make sure the door is always covered. But because of that, I can never fully participate in meetings, company parties, or events. I cannot stay longer than five minutes at anything before I am asked to go back, and no one else wants to cover for me because they also want to participate, and it is not their job like it is mine.

So I need advice. Should I stay? How do I make this situation better? The last time I spoke up, they said they would be accommodating, but nothing ever changes. At what point do I take the lack of action on the safety issue as proof that they do not care about me?",8,1760453186.0,AdminAssistant,11,1.0,False

1o6hh0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6hh0k/ex_talked_to_ex_and_lied_about_it_when_confronted/,Ex talked to ex and lied about it when confronted.,"Hi everyone, first of all this is the first time i've ever made a post on Reddit or put personal feelings out there, however a friend recommended this to me.

Some quick context: i have been together with my girlfriend for a year now. Before me she dated someone who she said was abusive, manipulative and overall just a bad guy who after 5 months dumped her. In the early stages of dating and throughout the relationship she would - from time to time - talk about her ex. Eg I'd compliment her shoes and she would say 'my ex really hated those' or somehow make links to her ex. I wasn't comfortable about it after the Xth amount of time because i thought maybe she still misses him but i never made an issue. After all we're human and past trauma shapes us, makes us.

Now before we were officially together, i had set the boundary that contact with him would be a dealbreaker for me, given how badly they ended and how bad she spoke of him. She agreed and we were together. During that 1 year, we never have had any fights, even small arguments. 

Now a lot of people are going to call me out for this -and rightfully so- but after a while I began to get suspicious. I snooped through her phone. Huge mistake i made because i invaded her privacy. 

The ex-boyfriend had sent her a birthday message and asked to catch up for a coffee. She said she never replied to it but after going through her phone, i found out she in fact replied and agreed to catch up. When i confronted her about this she said 'i just wanted to have the upper hand, i wasn't going through with it'. So already lies. She burst down in tears claiming she did not go see him, even saying how can you think this of me.

A few days later she admitted she did see him, another lie. I cooled off and we spoke again a few days later, she admitted to seeing him a second time. More than that, i found out she compared us in a way.

About her ex she had written (in a note): Why is her serious with his current girlfriend? Why does he want to marry her? Am i not good enough?

About me: I love him and he's a great guy but he's just not it. 

When you see those 2 topics in 1 note it makes you question everything. Ultimately she said she went to see the ex for closure, and i have to admit if she had communicated it properly i would have said, ofcourse you can go. But now it's just a bunch of lies and it makes you wonder if they did do more.

How would you guys handle this? Thank you in any case for taking the time to read this and replying.",1,1760453125.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It was a 15 day travel starting and ending at Belgrade. The below places were my base for stay during the period.

Day 1-3: Belgrade, Serbia

Day 4-5: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina

Day 6-7: Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina

Day 8-13: Kotor, Montenegro

Day 14-15: Travel back to Belgrade and return

  
**Total Budget**

140,000 INR or 1400 EUR.

Out of this around 500 euros is flights. Rest is accommodation and food plus the travels.

Avg accommodation cost in Euros per night:

Belgrade: 15

Sarajevo: 16

Mostar: 16

Kotor: 26 (this was one the downside of staying longer here)



**Accommodation**

I stayed in hostels and can recommend all of them:

Nomad Hostel, Belgrade

Balkan Han, Sarajevo (too good)

Majdas, Mostar (too good)

Centrum, Kotor



**Intercity Travels:**

Belgrade - Sarajevo: Took a BlaBlaCar, booked through website once in Belgrade. Paid in cash only.

Sarajevo - Mostar: Train, purchased tickets at station. Cards were accepted.

Mostar - Kotor: Bus. I purchased tickets directly at bus station but you can purchase online. However, you need to pay the 1 BAM at station to get a printout and entry to platform.

Kotor - Belgrade: Bus. Same as above.

0 problems at any border crossing. Only at Bosnia entry the lady was a bit confused when she could not find my VISA, I just opened the VISA page and she was happy enough.



**Destinations:**

I am not a party person. More of a walk around, have a coffee, watch the sunset person.

Belgrade: Bus 72 will get you from airport to center. And Google Maps will guide you anywhere in the city through public transport. No tickets so easy stuff. Belgrade was a very nice city but for me, since I don't party, perhaps the least WOW of the destinations. Cards were accepted in most places including small fast food places. I still used cash.

Sarajevo: The BlaBlaCar dropped me right at city center. Much closer than bus or train station. Very walkable city and a little more cash heavy than Belgrade but I did find cards were accepted in many places and Euros were also accepted in some places.

Mostar: I stayed in Mostar as I didn't feel the day trip wouldn't do any justice. If you want to do a day trip also, I would suggest DIY may be better than a paid day trip. Just take the morning train to Mostar and the train back to Sarajevo in the evening. It is really easy but depends what kind of traveler you are also. The evening sky was really a good one which you will miss on day trip.

Kotor: I did not plan on staying at Kotor this long. Zabljak was on my list for at least 2 days but the weather got too bad so I had to skip Zabljak. So was Kotor too long? Depends. Old Town I would recommend exploring before 10 am when the cruise ship crowds start flowing. A night walk and a day walk both are recommended. I did the hike up to the fortress from outside the town - don't pay the 15 euros, the hike is lovely. I went to Biogradska Park and Skadar Lake, because I had to do something with the days I had planned for Zabljak.

Went to Perast and Cetinje one separate days - took the Blue Line Bus to Perast and to Cetinje took the regular ones from bus station.

Even then I didn't do the bay boat tour because I thought it was expensive, some may like it. I didn't go to Budva, which again some may want to do. I didn't hike Lovcen. And I could have taken a day trip to Black Lake, Tara Canyon etc. So yes, it was kind of long but not as terrible. I could have gone to Albania or Ohrid if my passport privilege allowed but alas.



**My must visit suggestions**

Skadar Lake - most visited NP in Montenegro according to the guide.

Durmitor - if weather allows, best NP in Montenegro as per the guide at Skadar.

Others like Mostar Old Bride and Sarajevo Yellow Fortress, I am not suggesting because you will see those places if you end up in these small cities.



**Final Comments**

I do not know what more I can write which will be helpful to others. So I am leaving it at this. Please feel free to reach my DMs if you feel I can help with anything or here below in comments.

Definitely it could have gone better with weather. Sarajevo, Mostar and Montenegro were experience cold winds and gloomy days, starting snowing in Zabljak and raining. But weather can't be planned for. Adapt and still travel. Everything is an experience.

I am still at the process of trying to understand my faith and the catholic church as such and I mostly do that through reading and listening to podcasts. However, I would love to talk to other catholics about their faith journeys, whether you have been born into a catholic family or you discovered your faith later on.

I wake up at 6:45 to leave at 7:16-7:20. The previous night I had gone to bed at 11:30 because my boyfriend and I stayed up hugging and kissing and watching Instagram reels. This morning I woke up and kissed my boyfriend on his face. He woke up as well a bit and pushed my head to kiss his chest. He tightly grips my head when he wants me to do something, and he was pushing my head farther down but all I did and would do is kiss him. When it got to the point where he wanted MORE, I refused. He pleaded with me so I entertained him by only going a LITTLE farther (skipping out on excessive details.) but it went from kisses to a slightly ajar mouth. I stopped again though when he insisted on going farther, because I wanted to get ready for work and I wasn’t fully awake yet. Once I refused he asked me why and I said “I just don’t want to right now, I’m sorry.” His body went limp and he looked away from me. I tried to kiss his face and say sorry while hugging me. But he wouldn’t even look at me or kiss me back at all. I got up and made him coffee. He pretended to sleep and has refused to say I love you to me all morning.

1o6hbx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dry-Stretch5917/comments/1o6hbx8/fugitive_stars/,Fugitive stars,"You can feel when things are shifting, when it goes from fun to possibly dangerous. I can feel the heat hit my arms as I sit outside with my grandparents. The routine was always the same, she would wake up at 5 to make coffee, wake grandpa up, and wait for me to wake up to make breakfast, after that we would sit on the patio all day on our rocking chairs looking at every car that went by. Our aunt, who lived right across the street, would come every day just to sit with us. 

The air is thick hard to breath it in. No wind. Just hot sun, and a beautiful view. I go inside to get breakfast that grandma had prepared early on in the day. Eggs, salami, tomatoes, lettuce, and fried plantain is what she prepared. I like to put most of it into a sub sandwich. I grab a plate and start to open up the sub bread, adding mayonnaise for more flavor and less dryness. I hear a car pull up. My grandma says something about the bathroom light that had gone out the night before. Or should I say exploded. I know who it is. But the game began the moment I heard his car pull up. I know the rules, but the one that mattered the most here,  in this house, was rule #4. 

I nervously finish preparing my sandwich, grab some passionfruit juice grandma had bought early that week, and headed to the living room. His role here? To fix the bathroom light bulb that had exploded. He was studying to be an electrician, so if anything was wrong I'd hope he'd know. I can hear him and my grandparents talk. We've known each other since we were in diapers. We're only a year apart. Grandma tells him what happened, gets up and leads him to the bathroom. To get therevyou have to pass through the living room. I knew he was coming, yet i also knew my body wasnt gonna let me look up. As they got nearer i reached for my phone and started to watch one of those whacky free youtube movies. 

""Hey"" was all in heard.
""Hey"" is all I gave back. It's all we could ever do. The sandwich was good, I should've had it with coffee though I could tell the passiontfruit was concentrated. I walk to the kitchen putting my plate and my cup in the sink. Right next to the kitchen is the bathroom. I peak my head inside, but grandma saw me.

""Genesis, go get the latter for him,"" She giggles. ""I'm too old to carry that, can you help him? I'm gonna go check on grandpa"". 

Could I help him? Yes. Did I want to? No. Putting us together in any room is dangerous. 

""Yeah, I'll go get it"" but I knew i had to play the game. So I smiled, and went to help. 

I went to grab the latter that was outside leaning against the wall next to the washer. Yes, our washers outside. The latter's heavy, but not heavy enough for me to ask for help. I picked up, and headed inside towards the bathroom. I go in and immediately broke one of the rules. I made eye contact. Outside it was bright, daylight, sunny and hot. But inside this windowless bathroom, it was dark. I give him the latter trying to break the ice I had just created. He took it, but not before yanking by my waist getting me closer to him. I'm 5'4, short. He's 6'0 even. My mind had lost it right there, but my body needed to be kept cool. His right hand was holding onto the latter, his left grabbing onto my waist. When I say grabbing, I mean tightly. 

I had two options give in or walk away. I chose to give in. I slid my right hand to the back of his neck. I knew I shouldn't but I did. I purposely wanted to lock eyes with him. I wanted to see if he'd look away, if he'd change his movements. But just like me, he froze. In my mind it lasted forever, but it couldn't have been for more than a 20 seconds. He leaned in never breaking eye contact. I stayed connected to every eye movement he made. Every breath he took, and every finger he moved. Our lips locked. I hated tongue kissing, I hated every bit of the idea of it. That is until I reunited with him. Every part of my body wanted to devour him. He let go of the latter that leaned against the wall. His right hand now caressing the left side of my cheek, his left hand still on my waist. My left hand now holding onto the back of his neck. I interlock my fingers. He's now mine. But just briefly under this dark light. 

I hear my grandma walking towards the kitchen, I back away and he immediately sets up the latter. I grab the lightbulb that was placed on the storage cabinet. By the time grandma made it to the bathroom he was already climbing the latter, and I was placed at the bottom holding it, and holding the new bulb. 

The game failed. There was a malfunction. We aren't playing the rules. This isn't going to end well. 

we've managed to escape once again.

The thing is though, we seem to have fallen into taking each other for granted, feeling too comfortable, lack of effort has now pushed way to feeling a little invisible, plus we have older kids who will probably fly the nest within a few years, and so im unsure how we'll navigate just being a couple.  
*I'm not here to moan, or vent, promise!*

I go to work, i go through all the formalities talking with work colleagues who i have no real intention of becoming friends with, i have lunch on my own because i really cant stand how some people moan about the same thing day after day. I go home then normally i will prep and cook dinner, i cook 90% of the time, and i enjoy it, i find it therapeutic, i might then sort the washing out if there's a load in the machine, tidy up a little, shower then relax in front of the TV. 
*Wow, how boring does that sound?!*

Some things that i like..  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, horror/psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

A few things i dont like..  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

I see myself as a gentleman, im polite and courteous, i say strange words like ""please"" and ""thank you"",but please don't let that put you off!

Sooo here I am, giving it another shot - hoping luck’s on my side this time! I just want to date seriously for long term 🥺

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- 5’2” 
-No tattoos
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes 

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A SINGLE guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, 27-35 years old, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:,
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 

If this sounds like you…
Send me a message and tell me more about yourself such as what do you look like, important aspects in your background, current work, and/or your long-term goals, AND your go-to coffee order too!

Last month I tracked every single euro using my banking app and a spreadsheet. Here’s how it actually looked:

* **Groceries:** €430
* **Restaurants, snacks, coffee:** €495
* **Rent & utilities:** €1,240

Total expenses: **€3,573**  
  
I honestly didn’t expect that food and coffee would be my second biggest category after rent. I grab coffee on the go way too often, and eating out became my default when I’m busy.

The biggest surprise wasn’t how much I spend but how unaware I was. Those €6 lunches and €3 cappuccinos really add up fast.

1o6h6ez,https://i.redd.it/8gk13qju83vf1.png,"Beach House Espresso, Pocket-Sized. No Psychopathy Required.","We saw a post that really hit home-someone asking if it's ""psychotic"" to consider packing their full espresso setup like Breville Dual Boiler and Specialita Grinder for a beach vacation. That moment when you're weighing your 20kg home machine against your coffee standards? We've been there.

That's exactly why we created the OutIn Mino. Let's talk about how it solves your beach trip coffee dilemma.

Picture this: You're at your beach rental with three couples. Morning comes, and instead of settling for mediocre coffee, you pull out the Mino from your backpack. At just 67mm wide and 195mm tall, it takes up less space than your sunscreen and towel. No bulky machines, no separate grinders cluttering the counter.

Here's the best part for beach life: The Mino is fully sealed with IP67 protection, meaning beach sand and splashes won't stop your coffee ritual. If it gets sandy, just give it a quick rinse and keep brewing. The anti-slip grip ensures it stays put even on damp outdoor tables.

While everyone's getting ready, you can make six rich, crema-topped shots from one charge - no hunting for outlets in your rental. It heats water to perfect brewing temperature in under three minutes, using either your favorite ground coffee or convenient pods you picked up for the trip.

No more choosing between luggage space and coffee quality. With Mino, you get proper espresso that fits in your beach bag - not your entire trunk.

1o6h5wb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6h5wb,Mocha ice cream with fudge ripple,"While not particularly adventurous, this is a real crowd pleaser. Made for my wife who loves coffee and chocolate.

The ice cream base is strongly coffee flavored and pairs well with the rich, chewy chunks of fudge (which were supposed to be ribbons, but I've learned that I'm not so good at getting that right). This recipe is on the softer side and is nearly ready to scoop direct from the freezer.

A note on ingredients: Instant coffee makes the process much simpler and reproducible, but I wouldn't use Nescafe or something similarly terrible. If you can find a high quality instant coffee, that's probably a better bet. I'm also using decaf to avoid sleep issues. I added kahlua as well because I had it on hand and wanted a softer texture, but you could sub vodka or omit entirely.

# Ingredients

**Base**

[https://scoopulator.app/recipes/mocha-ice-cream-base-1bcf3f](https://scoopulator.app/recipes/mocha-ice-cream-base-1bcf3f)

* 410g Milk, whole
* 365g Cream, heavy
* 65g Skim milk powder
* 110g Granulated sugar
* 36g Dextrose
* 10g Cocoa powder
* 10g Instant coffee (Verve, decaf)
* 4g Vanilla extract
* 1g Guar gum Stabilizer
* 0.8g Salt, table, iodized Other
* 12g Kahlua

**Fudge ripple**

[https://scoopulator.app/recipes/fudge-ripple-dafeb0](https://scoopulator.app/recipes/fudge-ripple-dafeb0)

This uses a modified version of Dana Cree's. Replaced the glucose with dextrose and reduced the salt content from 5g to 3.5g because I didn't want the salt flavor to dominate.

* 200g Cream
* 75g Cocoa powder
* 60g Granulated sugar
* 40g Dextrose
* 3.5g Salt

# Instructions

**Make the fudge ripple**

1. Place the cream in a medium saucepan and cook over medium-high heat. When the cream comes to a full rolling boil, remove the pot from heat.
2. Mix the dry and wet ingredients. Add one-third of the hot cream to the cocoa powder, and whisk to a thick paste. Add the cream in two more additions, whisking between each until smooth.
3. Cook the fudge. Transfer the fudge back to the pot, scraping the sides of the bowl clean with a rubber spatula. This is important for the final texture; if you leave any fudge behind, your ripple will be too thin. Place the pot over medium-low heat and cook, stirring with a rubber spatula to prevent scorching, until the fudge starts to bubble and is very smooth.  Transfer to another container and store in the fridge.

**Make the ice cream**

1. Combine dry ingredients (sugars, stabilizer, milk powder, cocoa powder, coffee, salt)
2. Combine wet ingredients (milk, cream)
3. Thoroughly mix dry and wet ingredients (use a stick blender if you have one)
4. Move base into a sealed container and let age in fridge for at least 8 hours
5. Churn according to machine instructions
6. In layers, add churned ice cream and ribbons of fudge to the final container. Place in freezer until fully hardened.",18,1760452402.0,icecreamery,0,1.0,False

She works in Seattle and I live in San Francisco. It has not been easy, especially with both of us being busy all the time. Last week she finally got a short break, so she flew in for the weekend. I wanted to make every minute count. I used Wanderboat to plan a two-day date that would balance food, views, and quiet time. (tbh, nothing too touristy, just little things that felt real).

Day 1   
We started the morning at Tartine for pastries and coffee, then walked through Mission Dolores Park with a blanket and some fruit. The weather was perfect and we just sat there for hours talking about everything we had missed in each other’s lives. In the afternoon, we went to Lands End for sunset. Watching the light hit the cliffs while she leaned on my shoulder felt like something outside of a movie.

For dinner I booked a small Italian place in North Beach. We shared a bottle of wine, laughed about how she still gets lost in the city’s one-way streets, and ended the night walking along the pier with the skyline behind us.

Day 2   
The next morning we went for brunch in Hayes Valley, then wandered into a vintage bookstore nearby. She loves photography, so we spent an hour flipping through old photo collections. Later we headed to the Palace of Fine Arts. The reflection on the lake, the columns, the stillness, it was quiet enough that we barely spoke. Sometimes silence says everything.

We wrapped up the weekend with takeout sushi back at my apartment, sitting by the window and watching the fog roll in. It was simple but perfect.

Long distance can really wear you down, but weekends like this remind me why we keep going. You do not need something fancy or expensive, just time that feels intentional.

1o6h2dw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6h2dw,"Trip Report: Serbia, Bosnia, and Montenegro","I have received a lot of help from the travel community when planning my trips and I feel (or hope) this can be of some help to people who want to plan this same trip. 

  
It was a 15 day travel starting and ending at Belgrade. The below places were my base for stay during the period.

Day 1-3: Belgrade, Serbia 

Day 4-5: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina

Day 6-7: Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina

Day 8-13: Kotor, Montenegro

Day 14-15: Travel back to Belgrade and return



**Accommodation**

I stayed in hostels and can recommend all of them:

Nomad Hostel, Belgrade

Balkan Han, Sarajevo (too good)

Majdas, Mostar (too good)

Centrum, Kotor

  
**Intercity Travels:**

Belgrade - Sarajevo: Took a BlaBlaCar, booked through website once in Belgrade. Paid in cash only.

Sarajevo - Mostar: Train, purchased tickets at station. Cards were accepted.

Mostar - Kotor: Bus. I purchased tickets directly at bus station but you can purchase online. However, you need to pay the 1 BAM at station to get a printout and entry to platform.

Kotor - Belgrade: Bus. Same as above. 



0 problems at any border crossing. Only at Bosnia entry the lady was a bit confused when she could not find my VISA, I just opened the VISA page and she was happy enough.

**Destinations:**

I am not a party person. More of a walk around, have a coffee, watch the sunset person.

Belgrade: Bus 72 will get you from airport to center. And Google Maps will guide you anywhere in the city through public transport. No tickets so easy stuff. Belgrade was a very nice city but for me, since I don't party, perhaps the least WOW of the destinations. Cards were accepted in most places including small fast food places. I still used cash.



Sarajevo: The BlaBlaCar dropped me right at city center. Much closer than bus or train station. Very walkable city and a little more cash heavy than Belgrade but I did find cards were accepted in many places and Euros were also accepted in some places.

  
Mostar: I stayed in Mostar as I didn't feel the day trip wouldn't do any justice. If you want to do a day trip also, I would suggest DIY may be better than a paid day trip. Just take the morning train to Mostar and the train back to Sarajevo in the evening. It is really easy but depends what kind of traveler you are also. The evening sky was really a good one which you will miss on day trip.

  
Kotor: I did not plan on staying at Kotor this long. Zabljak was on my list for at least 2 days but the weather got too bad so I had to skip Zabljak. So was Kotor too long? Depends. Old Town I would recommend exploring before 10 am when the cruise ship crowds start flowing. A night walk and a day walk both are recommended. I did the hike up to the fortress from outside the town - don't pay the 15 euros, the hike is lovely. I went to Biogradska Park and Skadar Lake, because I had to do something with the days I had planned for Zabljak. 



Went to Perast and Cetinje one separate days - took the Blue Line Bus to Perast and to Cetinje took the regular ones from bus station.

  
Even then I didn't do the bay boat tour because I thought it was expensive, some may like it. I didn't go to Budva, which again some may want to do.  I didn't hike Lovcen. And I could have taken a day trip to Black Lake, Tara Canyon etc. So yes, it was kind of long but not as terrible. I could have gone to Albania or Ohrid if my passport privilege allowed but alas.

  
**My must visit suggestions**

Skadar Lake - most visited NP in Montenegro according to the guide.

Durmitor - if weather allows, best NP in Montenegro as per the guide at Skadar.

Others like Mostar Old Bride and Sarajevo Yellow Fortress, I am not suggesting because you will see those places if you end up in these small cities.



**Final Comments**

I do not know what more I can write which will be helpful to others. So I am leaving it at this. Please feel free to reach my DMs if you feel I can help with anything or here below in comments. I took like 900 photos, these 19 don't do justice to the places.

I live in a small isolated house in the middle of the surrounding woods, about half a mile outside of town proper with my friend Sam. I say vanished because to the rest of the world, I’m sure that’s precisely what happened. From what I’ve been told by those arriving after the fact, that’s the day that McDougal completely vanished from the map, or at least its people did. Supposedly, all of the buildings, cars, even food that was being eaten that day all remained.

For us, it was more of the rest of the world simply vanishing. Granted, we could only go as far as our cars could take us, but every town we came across, every city, every state was abandoned. Even massive metropolises known for housing millions of people were void of human life. To us, it wasn’t McDougal that had disappeared, it was the rest of the population, leaving only our small town of 2,000 people as the last bastion of humanity in an empty world.

Before anyone asks, no, I’m not here to tell you what happened. I’m not going to tell you what we discovered on our expeditions outside of town, I’m not here to tell you why this happened to our isolated community (not that I even could), and I’m not here to offer an explanation as to why you had the misfortune to wind up here. Honestly, I try not to think about that stuff. Maybe if there’s enough interest, Sam can talk to you about that in a follow up post, or in the comments. My purpose today with this post is simpler, more fundamental.

Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of new faces in town, the few times I’ve actually bothered to head down there. There was a time that wasn’t always the case, and it was only ever those that were initially pulled in after the entire town I call home seemed to become isolated. But over the past few months, we’ve been getting a slew of amateur podcasters, self labeled urban explorers, so called “paranormal investigators”, even the odd military man suddenly arriving overnight in town. They always say the same thing, that they fell asleep within the walls that used to house the residents of McDougal, and then they wake up here, with us. Most of them don’t last a week, some don’t even last their first day.

So at Sam’s behest, I’m offering this post as a basic guideline. I’ll run you through what the average night looks like for him and I so you can model that routine and not wind up as another victim. Personally I don’t care if you heed my warnings or not, but Sam is adamant that we have some sort of duty to keep newcomers safe. So if for no other reason, just pay attention for Sam’s sake. The following took place last night, and is a good, all encompassing example of what you can expect now that you’re stuck here with us.

At four hours until midnight, darkness begins to loom over the trees surrounding our small home in the woods. Before night fully falls, Sam and I work together to inspect the house’s entrances. Front door, side porch, windows, everything. We ensure that the wooden boards we use to block them off are secured, that it’s impossible for anyone or anything to get in. Some days we discover that the boards are shattered, or forcefully pulled away from the house, and we replace them. Once we’re just about done, I leave him to finish up and perform one last check on our surroundings, make sure I don’t see anything moving in the veil of brown and green surrounding us.

During the daylight hours, the woods serve a number of purposes, such as isolation from people I don’t wish to deal with, natural cover from any new threats, and as a source of small game in the form of squirrels and rabbits, even the odd deer if I’m lucky. At night, however, they serve as a place for panicking people to get lost, and as cover for the Repeaters.

If you don’t know what those are, look at the name and think for a second. You know those people around town who have the same conversations with clearly different peopke, knock on doors to abandoned buildings and go inside, or those who walk the exact same way for the exact same amount of time? Notice how they do those things day after day, with no alteration? Yeah, those are Repeaters, and they’re more dangerous than you think. We don’t get many out this way, but there are more than a few who are trapped in the cycle of hopelessly wandering the woods. So, we keep an eye out.

At three hours to midnight, we get inside the house and lock the front door, light some lanterns and candles for light, and make sure anything that we could step on or stumble over is out of the way. Next we check to make sure there’s nothing causing any noticeably audible noise that can be heard from outside. Sometimes that means one of us going back out and listening while the other checks an appliance, especially if it’s something new. We have to be thorough, after all. If our dishwasher or laundry is running, we stop it.

One thing you need to learn quick is that anything is better than breaking a Repeater’s pattern. Soggy clothes, missing shoes, a bruised elbow, anything. I don’t care how much you hate leaving something unfinished or how much you need the air conditioning going to be able to sleep. If using an object or completing a task would interrupt a Repeater, LEAVE IT. It’s not worth your life.

At two hours to midnight, we do a weapons check. Dissemble our guns, make sure they’re clean and in working order. We check how much ammo we have, make sure we have the right ammo. For us, that’s 30.06 for our Winchester 70, and .45 ACP for our 1911. Technically you don’t need bullets with that much stopping power, anything that can drop a human target reliably will suit you just fine. But be warned, the Repeaters can take a lot of damage, way more than you would think or expect. So stopping power helps a lot, buys you time.

We also keep at least one close quarters weapon on us, usually something that stabs or bashes. For me, that equates to a ten inch hunting knife my father gave me for my eighteenth birthday. If you’re like Sam, that means a baseball bat, something powerful enough to stop something coming at you, but not lethal enough to kill it in one hit. Usually. You don’t need those exact items, anything that works against closing in threats is perfectly adequate. Ideally, you don’t want anything getting that close to you, that’s what the guns are for. But it’s better to have and not need than to need and not have, as the saying goes.

At one hour to midnight, we figure out who’s staying up on watch. We get our plan together, make sure we’re both on the same page. Last night’s conversation went something like this;

“I can keep watch tonight. You’ve been staying up the past three nights now, it’s not good for you, man.” Sam said as he sat opposite to me at the small circular kitchen table. He fidgeted with this fingers, a kind expression written across his face as he leaned forward.

“I’m fine. I don’t mind sleeping during the day.” I rebutted, ignoring his silent pressuring.

“We could always switch to shifts, like I recommended.” I knew his offer was sincere, but I didn’t like the idea of trying to set that up in just one hour.

“No. Too risky.” Sam sighed and rubbed his forehead, clearly exasperated with me.

“It’s not like we’d be screaming at each other, Damien. Just shaking the other awake, making sure they’re good and-“

“I said no.”

“Damien.” Sam’s voice sounded noticeably worried, despite his efforts to hide it.

“Sam, I’m fine. What we’re doing works, and we don’t have time to change it. We can talk about in the morning if it bothers you.”

“Which it does.” He said somewhat sternly.

“Then think of a good argument for it, maybe you’ll change my mind. Good night Sam.” I think he realized that I wasn’t budging on this one, not tonight. Without a word he pulled the 1911 from behind his pants and set it on the table in front of me.

“At least hold onto this,then.” I stared at the wooden handle of the pistol for a moment, the recently cleaned iron shimmering in the candlelight.

“What if you need it? I already have the rifle.” I argued, pulling it up from under the table and setting it in front of me. Sam shook his head.

“If we’re not doing shifts, there’s no point in me having it. The people out there are getting worse and I’m worried…” I noticed his voice catch in his throat, and he seemed to fight something back. He always worried too much, poor Sam. A pang of sadness ran through me as he cleared his throat before continuing.

“I’m worried there’s gonna be more than you can take with a bolt action. You need to be able to handle them fast if worse comes to worse. So please, take it. I’ll hear you if you fire anyway.” I wanted to argue more, point out that if rifle fire did wake him up, he would easily be able to rush to my defense and use the gun if he still had it on him. Besides, for all his talk of wanting me safe, I wanted him safe too. There was, after all, a window in the bedroom. Boarded up, secured, maybe, but there was a good chance it wouldn’t stay that way.

Still, this was clearly important to him, and more pressingly, we were short on time. So I relented, sighing as I took the strap on the rifle and slung it over my shoulder.

“Safety’s on.” Sam reminded me as I took hold of the pistol and slipped it neatly into the back of my trousers. I nodded at him, and saw a faint smile of relief cross his face as he sat back, the candlelight only just barely revealing his short blonde hair and green eyes. There was a silent thank you in his expression, one that I’m sure was supposed to make me feel better.

All it did was make me seriously consider shifts after all.

Midnight. Sam was asleep, or at least he better have been. I’d given him my room for the night, as I sat on the couch that normally served as his sleeping spot. The room was bathed in the soft candlelight from the center of the old coffee table. In the light I could see the outlines of our old television, some old photos depicting either Sam’s family or mine, the old recliner I’d sit in when we we’d watch TV in the odd case we had a lazy day, and of course, the front door, locked and secure.

Anything beyond that was only vague shapes. The candlelight was just bright enough to reveal their presence, but did not extend deep enough into the darkness to expose their details. A large circular disc denoted the kitchen table, and a few rectangular blocks were the only indication I had of our refrigerator, cupboards, dishwasher, and sink. That is to say nothing of the small gap behind me, leading to a small hallway that, though I knew led to the bathroom, laundry room, and bedroom, appeared to be nothing more than a deep wall of blackness. The thick dark caused my chest to feel heavier as I observed it, and I felt my grip on the rifle tighten.

I did my best to keep my mind from wandering or succumbing to fear, instead keeping close attention to any noise I heard around the house, and outside. Every so often I would look at the watch given to me by my mother before I left home, noting the time so I’d be ready for each event.

12:52 AM was when things truly started. While we had mostly boarded up the window overlooking our front yard, there were still small slits between the boards of wood that we could use to peek out if necessary. Unfortunately, this also meant things from outside could look in once they got close enough.

We kept our windows ever so slightly open at night. If you don’t have any major activity by your home, you obviously don’t need to do this, as it is a risky, oftentimes unnecessary gamble in the event you, or something in your shelter makes noise. For Sam and I, however, it was the only way we could hear the approaching footsteps and of our first visitor.

Upon hearing the telltale signs of crackling twigs and old leaves, I moved away from the couch, stepping slowly to the side of the window as I clutched my rifle close to my chest.

One thud, two thuds, three thuds. My heart began racing, and I forced myself to hold my breath. For a moment there was nothing, as whatever made the sounds outside my home silently peered inside. A deep groan filled the air as I took another cautious step away from the window. Out of the blackness, in flickering light, I saw burly looking fingers curl around one of the planks of wood, as the first Repeater lifted a long dead flashlight to my window.

“Hello? Is anyone in there, I need a little help.” The man’s voice wasn’t threatening in the slightest, if anything it was slightly pitiable. There was a shakiness to it, a tiredness, like he was trying to catch his breath. I said nothing, no one had been here the night he arrived looking for help, and so no one could be tonight either.

Knock. Knock. Knock as the man gave three soft pounds against the wood. The man peered closer to the window. I could just see his shape leering close to the window, using the free hand to hold over his eyes, lifting the dead flashlight higher through one of the cracks. No doubt he saw the candle, which of course hadn’t been there the first night either. Thankfully, that deviation was so small it meant next to nothing.

“Hello?” Asked the man again. I kept still, my finger twitching as I fought to keep it off the trigger. One minute, two minutes, three minutes passed as the lifeless flashlight passed over and over across the window.

“Please, I’m lost, I just need some help.” The man’s voice was soft, pleading. I did not respond, I could not respond. It may seem heartless, but he was too far gone. After a minute more, the Repeater gave up with a defeated sigh, and loudly began to stomp away from the window. I didn’t immediately return to my spot on the couch, instead waiting a few more minutes until I could no longer hear his stomping, or his defeated gasps of breath as he left. After I was satisfied, I let out the breath I was holding and sat back down, trying to force my chest to stop pounding through deep, calculated breaths.

The next few hours were calm, save for the odd scratching and whispers asking if anyone was inside from the few people who’d found us from time to time. These Repeaters, thankfully, had not peered through the window as the first had. So, I needed only to keep my rifle at the ready, just in case something set them off. Another valuable lesson, if a Repeater has no reason to see you, don’t give it one. Stay out of its sight, don’t make a sound, don’t interrupt its routine. They’ll leave you alone. Usually.

3:52 AM, the night was almost over, and I had only one visitor left. This last Repeater was technically our first, one we had encountered in the first few days our town became isolated. A lot of people broke down in those initial days, and most of us were too frightened and, frankly, too busy panicking  to focus on the Repeater problem. That led to a lot more of them, including the one I now had to face, the one I had to turn away.

Taking a deep breath, I sat up from the couch and made my way to the door, checking the bolt of my rifle one last time. I was only slightly relieved to see the brass casing reflecting a soft bit of candlelight back at me. With any luck, no ammo would be spent tonight.

If you must deal with a Repeater, try to learn exactly what their routine is, and mimic it to the best of your ability. Think of it as an acting exercise, try not to mess up, and be ready.

Carefully stepping by the front door, I checked by the nightstand beside it for the flashlight I kept there. Sure enough, there was a bright red, chunky plastic flashlight I used specially for events like tonight. Steeling myself, I slung the rifle behind my shoulder, just out of sight, and took the small twisting metal on the door knob in my hand. After a soft twist, I heard the barely discernible clicking of metal as the door unlocked.

“Stay calm. You know what to say, what to do.” I said aloud to myself. Swinging the door open, I gently stepped outside into the cool night air, chirping crickets and cicadas quickly filling my ears as I took in the near pitch blackness of the treeline underneath the starless, cloudy night sky. I counted the seconds as I gripped the strap on my rifle tightly.

One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six seconds. The first signs, deep breathing, panting, the cracking of leaves and snapping branches.

“Hello! Anyone!” Came a distraught voice from the woods. Even all these years later, the pain in his voice was unmistakable.

“Can anybody hear me?! Please, it’s my daughter!” He begged, I could see the tears on his face even before he came visible. My turn.

“Hello? Who’s out there?” I asked, pitching my voice ever so slightly higher. The truth is, it was Sam who had been out here all those nights ago. Unable to sleep, trying desperately to reach his mom on his phone. In the distance, I saw a man stumble out of the woods and fall onto his hands and knees, huffing as he laid on the rocky road leading to the house. He was still too far away to see any features, but I could hear him panting, his breaths raspy as he desperately sucked in air.

“Sir? Sir are you okay?” I asked with false concern. The frame of the man turned, still huffing as he stumbled up. The shuffling of rocks signified him getting closer, and I fought the urge to ready my rifle as my focus deepened, ready for anything.

“Please, please you have to help me, it’s my daughter! One of those things got her!” He exclaimed as he stepped closer. I had no idea what the man looked like as he stopped a few feet from the steps leading up to our porch. There was only enough light from the clouded sky to reveal his shape, huffing, puffing, wheezing.

“Those things? You mean the Repeaters?” I asked in Sam’s voice. The figure nodded frantically.

“Yes, she got in their way and they took her into the woods! I need help, please I need to find her!” He begged. I pretended to acquiesce.

“I-I’ll go get some help, just stay there!” Without another word, I walked back to the door while keeping an eye on the figure, calmly opened it, and stepped inside. Technically, this was a deviation. Sam had been somewhat frantic that night, nearly throwing open the door as he rushed inside. His clattering had been what woke me up that night, sounds I most certainly hadn’t been making. These types of deviation are fine, so long as they don’t interrupt the Repeater, or drastically alter the events they’re trapped in. So, I grabbed the flashlight by the door, then proceeded to wait several minutes.

I kept a close eye on the Repeater through a small peep hole as time crawled ever so slowly. Even though I was playing my part, there was no guarantee that everything around me would play out exactly the same. We were in the middle of the woods, surrounded on all sides by wild life, wild life that by its very nature was unpredictable. It’s best to keep an eye out when you have such a massive variable, one you can never fully account for. The Repeater, for his part, never deviated, following the same pattern I’d seen for years now. Exhausted huffing, placing his hands on his head and pacing as he waited outside, holding his arm periodically.

4:01 AM, I could feel my stomach drop. Forcing myself to take a deep breath, I slung the rifle so I held it in one hand, tucked the flashlight under my arm with the other, then opened the door. I quickly shifted the flaslight to my open hand and flicked it on as I stepped outside, focusing on the Repeater.

The Repeater, just like always, winced at the sudden light and turned to face me, holding out a dirt covered, scarred hand as he backed away slightly. His thin autumn coat was torn, ripped in several places and revealing hints of a long sleeved t-shirt. His grass stained jeans fared no better, small holes revealing scabbed skin in some places, and fresh cuts in others. Even all this time later, I pitied the man. When I’d first encountered him, his clothing had looked almost brand new, but years of reliving the worst day of his life had left them just as broken as he was.

“Just focus… You’re almost done.” I told myself.

“You, what did you say to my friend? Why are you even here?” I asked harshly, using my own voice this time. Like everyone else, I’d been confused and scared at the time, and on that particular night, had just experienced a sudden and unwanted awakening. If I could take back what I said, what I did, believe me, I would. Instead, I watched for the thousandth time as the man blinked rapidly, squinting as he fought against the light. His voice shook when he tried to respond.

“I-I was just asking for help, I swear! My daughter, she was taken, I’m trying to-“

“At this time of night? What’s wrong with you?! You’re gonna get yourself and probably us killed!” I yelled, interrupting the man. I hated the venom in my voice, I hated the startled yelp the man let out as he raised his hands in a non-threatening gesture, pieces of fabric dangling from his arms. Most of all I hated what I’d missed all those nights ago, the sight of the man crying, barely holding it together.

“Please, I just want-“ He tried to say, his voice trembling. Again I interrupted him.

“I don’t care what you want, you need to leave, now.” The Repeater’s expression dropped, shaking his head in sheer disbelief and despair as he opened his mouth to speak again.

CRASH. My heart leapt up into my throat.

“No, no no no no…” I thought. In an instant I turned to my left, shining the beam of light towards the small gravel driveway that housed my car and our trashcans. In the light I could see both trash cans, both of which should have been standing. Instead, I could see one of them tipped over, trash spilling on the ground as a raccoon obliviously picked away at the escaping pile. My grip around the rifle tightened, and I could feel my flashlight hand begin to shiver.

“Crap…” I thought. A deviation, and a big one. Turning back to the Repeater, I could see his expression and demeanor change in an instant. His fear, his despair, his pitiable stance were all gone. In their place I saw a hardened, almost animalistic rage in his eyes, fists clenching so tightly that I could see fresh blood dripping from where his long dirtied nails dug into his skin. His attention was divided between myself and the offending raccoon, his huffing breath turning into a heaving growl as the white in his eyes turned red.

“Crap…” I said aloud. My mind went a mile a minute as I tried forcing myself to calm down, taking deep breaths and steadying my hands.

“I said you need to leave, NOW.” I said in a shaking voice, trying desperately to get the Repeater to recognize his routine. The Repeater only growled louder, veins beginning to become visible in his hands and in his face.

Without thinking I dropped the flashlight and heard it clattering to the ground as I raised my rifle, aiming at the Repeater as it became half bathed in light, half shrouded by darkness.

“Don’t make me shoot you!” I shouted, my voice trembling as I trained my scope on the Repeater’s chest. I regretted the words as soon as I said them. This was another massive deviation. As poorly as I handled the situation years ago, I’d never threatened to shoot the man. Any chance I had now of keeping this from escalating was gone. The Repeater grit his teeth as he hissed in reply, his eyes becoming almost completely red as blood freely poured from his hands.

Suddenly, the man roared, pouncing from a dead stop as he lept forward, screaming as he charged me at full sprint.

“CRAP!” I yelled in a panic.

CRACK, followed immediately by an ear shattering BANG. The shot had been both a reflex, and intentional all at once as it echoed across the formerly silent woods. Quick, easy, without thought. That’s the only way to deal with one attacking you, no mercy, no thought as to who they are or were, just rapid and decisive force.

The shot hit the charging Repeater in the chest, the force of the round twisting his body as he stumbled and slammed into the ground. I quickly cycled the bolt, the sound of the empty brass casing hitting the wooden porch almost completely drowned out as the Repeater screamed in fury, fumbling with its hands to push itself back up. The monster rose his gaze to meet mine, its eyes practically dripping with fury as it roared, spit and blood flying from its lips as it tried to push towards me.

A second CRACK and BANG left my ears ringing, and my head felt like it was almost splitting open from a sudden headache, a painful reminder that I’d forgotten to wear any form of ear protection. In the moment I hardly cared about that, however. My attention was focused on the man I’d just killed. His head was a mere fraction of what it was, now shattered and split partly open. Shards of his bloody skull were visible in the beam of the flashlight, and I found myself feeling sick to my stomach.

Even knowing what he was, I felt a twinge of guilt welling up in my stomach as a wave of exhaustion swept over me. This was twice now I had killed him, I realized. Thoughts of him somehow getting better and returning to himself flooded my mind for an instant before falling away, replaced by the sight of his lifeless body.

“I… I’m sorry…” Was all I could say as I lowered the rifle, my hearing slowly retutning to me as I took a step back.

“Damien?! Damien what happened, are you alright?!” I heard the panicked voice of my friend shout.

“I’m fine, Sam. I’m fine.” I lied as I cycled the bolt a second time, letting the expended round fall to the ground outside before stepping back inside, my eyes never leaving the body in front of me. Even as I closed the door, I could hear the distant sound of two more screams somewhere in the woods, more Repeaters, more people who’d gotten lost in the woods. More people who’d lost hope.

Sam and I didn’t sleep the rest of that night. Occasionally, we’d hear a rabid Repeater slamming against our windows or our door as they screamed, held our breath as they tried bashing their way in. Morning came before they could make progress, and, for whatever reason, they fell back into their routines.

I’ll let that be the last lesson, before signing off and leaving you with this post. If you have the ability to, hunker down and hide from the Repeaters if you suspect they’ll come after you. You won’t be able to outrun them. If there’s enough of them, and believe me, make enough noise and there will be, you won’t be able to out fight them. Just hide. Hide, and pray they don’t find you. Try to fix whatever damage they do when it’s safe, then get ready to deal with them again.

If you have any other questions, leave them here, I guess. I’m sure Sam or myself with get to them at some point.

Above all, stay safe, try not to give up. We don’t need more of them around here.

EDIT - Sam just informed me that he’ll be posting his follow up in minute. I’ll link to it here once he’s actually got it up.

1o6guim,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o6guim/till_eternity_short_story/,Till Eternity (short story),"""Amid the cold and rigid nights, I met your soft welcoming hands. They held my face ever so gently, feeling every crevasse and hair on my face, as if to study me like a topographical map. When your hands would let go and our lips met, I would feel fire in my soul again, my body giving itself to you, as you accepted me for what I was. And when our eyes locked and you began to discover my soul that I had lost, I worried you would recoil with what you would discover. So when your father found me holding your body, I couldn't help to but mourn for him, as he readied his handgun, and fired.""



His handgun went off and the rounds hit me, my body coursed with pain and I began to fall, yet my grip on you help tight. Your father began to cry and so did I. He lowered his handgun, wiping the tears from his face, shortly after dropping his weapon, then to his knees. He wept, and wept and wept and wept, his cries sounding of that of a newborn child, lost and scared. The wind carried the sound of the trees towards us and I looked off to the forest behind me.



""My daughter...is she...she dead?"" he asked, his vocals shaking so much you would believe he had a guitar string loose in his throat.

""I am afraid so, sir"" I hesitated to respond. I wished he would have left when I told him to, that this battle was not his, that he should've taken you. He stood on his feet, wiping his face of the mucus that had accumulated, and he stared at me.

""I give...I give you permission."" These words spoken, broke a seal that only my kind cant break, a seal that can only be broken with the blessing of a creators, as we can not create ourselves. These words also invoke emotions into us. I shouted,

""What im about to do, can not be undone, she will be eternal, all powerful, till death due her, till death due me! Tell me Mr. Jenson, are you okay with condemning your daughter to eternal life? She will outlive you and bare no offspring."" My voice loud as a steam engines whistle, and fangs barred. My nails grew longer and my hair followed. I was not a good person, and my form showed it, yet...

""I do! I, Thomas Clive Jenson, Give you, Magnus Wayne, my blessing to create...death."" His voice lowered at the end, less shaky than before.

""Then I shall create the most beautiful death you have ever seen, Mr. Jenson.""

Holding her in my arms, her body softly lit by the crescent moon, pale as piece of paper and her hair darker than ground coffee, she was beautiful even in rest.

""Time to return to me, my love."" I softly spoke to her, pushing her hair off her neck and feeling for her vain. I know where they are, I just wish to keep this damage as minimal as can be. locating the vein, I lowered my face to hers, instinctually falling towards her lips as I've done before. Redirecting myself towards her neck, I dug my fangs in, injecting one fourth of my own blood into hers, while cycling hers into mine. She tasted sweet, and oh how I miss her.



After a minute passed, the forest began to shake, as the Treemen have finally caught up to me. I finally finished, and now I had to wait. Retracting my fangs from her neck, I pulled away slowly. But something is wrong. She should have turned by now. I've done the process before, why is this taking so long. Was I too late? No I had time to spare.

I looked towards her father who was waiting just as eagerly as me. Why isn't she-

""My love, is that you?"" her voice silenced the wind and the trees shaking. I smiled, staring at her eye to eye.

""In the cold flesh My dear."" slowly putting her down, she stood on her two feet, looking around, finally seeing her father. She knew she had turned, its easy to tell the difference in how you feel.



Her father rushed to her side, grabbing her with the utmost care. he grabbed her face and arms, as if to check for any wounds, but by now they would have healed. Hugging her, he turned his gaze to me and mouthed ""Thank you.""

I nodded back, and turned my attention towards the forest. I had a high bounty on my head, and now I must pay for it. Turning back towards her, I say

""Ill see you soon my dear, just wait for me."" She laughed and replied

""Till eternity if I have too.""",2,1760451671.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Zero momentum.,"This founder was doing everything right and it destroyed them. LinkedIn, Reddit, blogs, cold email, paid ads. The brutal truth? Doing everything means doing nothing well.

I see this constantly. Founders stretched across five channels posting inconsistently while getting buried by algorithm changes and declining organic reach. Then they blame the platform or their product when really theyre just scattered.

Heres what actually fixed it:

PHASE 1: FOCUS (Week 1) Pick one channel (LinkedIn for B2B). Stop everything else. This isnt a suggestion its mandatory.

PHASE 2: COMMITMENT (90 Days Minimum) Post 3-5 times weekly not daily. Reply to every comment in the first hour. Comment on 10-15 posts from your ideal customer profile every single day. Most founders quit after 30 days right when momentum builds.

PHASE 3: SYSTEMIZE Batch your content on Sunday. Write five posts at once. Never schedule them. Post manually at your peak hours when your audience is actually online. Document one real result per week whether thats a coffee call or a customer interview.

PHASE 4: MEASURE WHAT MATTERS Track only three metrics: new connections from your ICP, engagement rates on your posts, and direct messages. Forget vanity metrics. Forget follower count.

I watched founders crush it on LinkedIn while others chased SEO rankings taking 6+ months. The difference wasnt talent or budget. They played one game deeply instead of five games poorly.

Extended sales cycles scare everyone. But theyre easier to navigate when youre actually building relationships consistently in one place instead of ghosting five channels. LinkedIn lets you nurture buyers through their entire decision process if youre actually there.

And id been up front that I was moving to far away for an unknown time before hand but was just enjoying his company and sex before the move. We had also discussed dating preferences and he knows I'm not a huge fan of monogamy but want a relationship. (Hard-core monogamists, pls peace out here) and the day i left i made the mistake of saying I thought of him as a bf. 

I moved and we kept in infrequent touch. I returned for a week vacation mid year and suddenly no sex. He won't put out at all like he wanted to and couldn't bring himself to. He said it was thyroid issues? Later I learned from him no he's healthy but no explanation still. I return to far away. And like I was working in far north and completely alone and isolated. 

Now a year later I moved back and am going to school but he still has no libido and I get the feeling thinking back on prior sexual encounters he was just putting out when he didn't want to just cause he likes me that much. 

I can't do this. Im going down the ""slow fade away"" but generally people think guys who do this are assholes and I do care about him and wanna do right by him. We've also never used the love word. How do I break up? I can't very well be like ""hey let's grab a coffee i wanna chat with you"" cause hell know and call it out and then it'll just become a txt breakup",2,1760451575.0,gay,2,0.75,False
1o6gszc,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1o6gszc/the_day_i_accidentally_joined_a_zoom_meeting_that/,The Day I Accidentally Joined a Zoom Meeting That Wasn’t Mine,"Last year, I was working from home, half awake, coffee in hand, trying to join our weekly Monday meeting. I clicked the link from my calendar, turned my camera on, and greeted everyone with my usual “Morning, everyone!”

Except… no one responded.

I looked around, and quickly realized I didn’t recognize a *single* face. It wasn’t my team. It wasn’t even my company.

Before I could leave, someone said, “Oh, you must be the new intern from the Chicago branch!” I panicked. My brain short-circuited. And instead of saying, “Sorry, wrong meeting,” I just… went with it.

For the next ten minutes, I sat there nodding along like a professional imposter. They were discussing quarterly sales for a product I’d never heard of. At one point, they asked if I had anything to add, and I said, “I’ll have to double-check the numbers on my end.” (What numbers? I have no idea.)

Finally, someone dropped a company name in the chat, and it hit me: I’d somehow joined a *completely different corporation’s meeting.*

I mumbled something like, “Oh no, my Wi-Fi’s cutting” and vanished mid-sentence like a ghost.

**TL;DR:** Tried to join my company’s Zoom call, accidentally joined a stranger’s meeting, pretended to be their intern for ten minutes, and barely escaped with my dignity intact.",7,1760451571.0,story,11,0.65,False

1o6gs6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1o6gs6r/turkeys/,Turkeys,"We just hosted Canadian Thanksgiving at our new house and my in-laws came to stay.
I’m not from Canada but my partner is so I don’t care a huge amount about the holiday.

My partner told his mum to bring the full turkey dinner with all the trimmings for the lunch as “it’s her favourite meal to cook”. So the entire thing was made by her. He even got his dad to carve the turkey.

Some people would be grateful they didn’t have to cook and maybe I should be too but it just felt weird to me.

We don’t particularly get on - they’re not very empathic and I find they’re kind of bullies. They’re always having family feuds and stuff. I’m polite with them but we’ve definitely had our moments.

The MIL also FAWNS over our daughter. They had a severely disabled daughter and had to care for her for years until she passed so having a granddaughter is very special to them. She treats her like a doll or a toy to play with. She’s always in her face and loves to dress her up in clothes she’s bought for her and spoon feed her (she’s 3 and perfectly capable of feeding herself). It can be a bit much and we’ve clashed in the past because she wouldn’t hand her back to me when she was upset etc. 

This weekend my partner also (and I know this is SO minor but) he gave his mum my new coffee mug. My friend bought me and my daughter matching “big boo” and “little boo” mugs for Halloween/a house warming gift. I’d given my daughter some milk in her little boo mug and went upstairs. When I came downstairs he was handing his mum the “big boo” mug and saying look they match awww. I know it’s just a silly mug but it felt like I was erased and he was people pleasing his mum. Like, that’s my cute mug and she’s my daughter, come on…

Anyway so they leave and me and my partner were chatting about the next few months and he says he’d like them to stay for Christmas too - and his mum can cook and bring the turkey dinner again. Because she’s “so good at it” and loves doing it.

Am I insane for feeling upset by this? I’m not a big fan of cooking but I’ve cooked a roast turkey dinner before. And it’s my house. Can’t I at least be given the chance to host Christmas?

Note I have no family over here so holidays are always hard for me. So it would just be them and us. In our brand new house. Thinking about it makes me want to cry honestly.

My partner says I’m being over sensitive and it’s just a meal… but why can’t we just have our own traditions? He doesn’t even get on with his dad and they’re always getting into drunken arguments when they’re together… 

What would you do? I’m this close to just booking flights back to my own country for the holidays and saying f-it! ",37,1760451519.0,JUSTNOMIL,35,0.97,False

To discover he has ia online girlfriend.,"Ok some context: I (30f) have been with my bf (34m) for 4yrs, we've been long distance until we both relocated and finally moved in together. 
Previously (Feb 2024) my bf had been caught going for coffee with another woman claiming it was"" just friendly"", but it turns out it was a date. 
We separated for a short while before giving it another go. 
We've recently moved in together, this were going amazingly...or so I thought ..

Flash forward the other evening, he left his phone unlocked on our coffee table and I noticed he was getting calls and Whatsapp messages from someone with just initials (Ts) and wondered if it was important, so I went to take the phone into him in our bedroom and realised this person was addressing him as ""baby"" and ""my love"". And if he was able to escape to speak..
What made it worse the chat was set to disappearing messages (sus...) 
Scrolling up I found messages from 2023 advising he had to hide the chat and he was so glad to have finally virtually seen this person.
I've not confronted him on it as I feel like I am the AH for reading the messages to begin with, but he is the AH for cheating.
Unsure what to do.
