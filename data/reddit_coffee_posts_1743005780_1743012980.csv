1jkiifh,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1jkiifh/home_brewing_stain/,Home brewing stain,"Hi! I'm primarily a visual artist & used to work in a frame shop, have been making my own frames for the past two years or so. So far I've primarily used the minwax dark walnut danish oil to finish them, and have been happy enough with the results. I'm going to start looking for a better/homemade solution though, and I'd love yall's thoughts. Here are my goals/reasons for making my own:

* I don't have a ventilated indoor space to work in, so I right now I am only finishing frames when it's nice enough out to let them dry all day (I live in Michigan so this is a pretty limiting constraint). I'd like something with 0 fumes, and drying time is not a concern as I can start frames many weeks before they're needed.
* The color of the danish oil is a little bit more neutral/gray that what I would ideally want. This is of course informed by the wood as much as the stain but I'd like to push it just a little bit warmer.
* Commercial stains are expensive, and I'm tired of reading dire prop 65 warnings. I know they're on everything under the sun but it's just a nice feeling to know what all is in something and not be concerned about any of it.
* Making things is fun! Experimenting is fun!

Here is what I am trying so far: A stain made of coffee (for warmth/red-brown) and steeped black walnuts (for darkness/gray-brown), applied in a couple of coats, with a single coat of tung oil over for a tiny bit of protection & glow. Considering also adding some dark iron oxide. I don't want any gloss, I just want to darken the wood a little, make the grain pop, and make it slightly easier to dust. I'm pretty happy with the results so far, particularly on cedar! My questions:

* Have you made your own stain before? What ingredients worked best for you?
* Am I missing something major here? It seems surprisingly straightforward, but since I'm not looking to protect from wear & tear it seems like if it looks good, it is good.
* This one seems to require a number of layers of intersecting knowledge, but just in case there are any combo woodworker/conservator/chemists out there: To what extent does acidity migrate through wood over time? Would I need to neutralize the stain before applying in order to make the frames archival?

(Long post about a year of symptoms),"26F. I've always had acid reflux on and off since middle school, seemingly unrelated to food (I took notes and couldn't find a correlation), it would just appear randomly and last a few days or weeks. I sporadically used antacids and slept on my left side. All my life I alternated periods of shit eating (severe stress)  and clean/semi clean eating, so I couldn't find a link to food.

At some point I started getting this gut wretching stomach pain out of nowhere every few days (April '24). I thought it was because I was stupid and sporadically took nsaids on an empty stomach, but I stopped immediately. No blood or anything. No one would give me anything for it so I literally cried to my doctor and she put me on emoprazole ""for a month, then call me and we'll see"". That turned into me calling at the end of the month and her just being annoyed at my pain not going away, and just leaving me with a ""let's just do another month"". 

That went on for 4 entire months, until late July. Pain was still happening. I was testing various different psychotropic medication during that time. End of june I was pissed at my doctor as a friend that studies medicine told me about H. Pylori. Doc was annoyed at my test request, and she was surprised I hadn't gotten that done before. ...why would I have, you're literally my doctor? I was just pissed off. Came back negative though.

I'm wondering about antipsychotics now because that's when i first got the new extreme GI symptoms out of nowhere, in July '24. Took Abilify/aripiprazole for the first time on July 10th,  only 4 days, as it gave me extreme muscle pain, HIGH fever symptoms without an actual fever, and whatever felt like an acute gastroenteritis, I was constantly in the toilet for 2 weeks despite the fact I couldn't eat anything. I ate maybe a single bite of toast and crackers a couple of those days. Fever went away immediately as I stopped Abilify but not the GI issues. 

The day I stopped abilify, I got really sharp pain late at night, after eating a couple spoonfuls of ice cream (never caused me issues, couldn't stomach anything else those days, my boyfriend was desperate to get anything edible in my stomach). 
The day after, no food, I got the worst pain of my life. I was forced to lay in a weird as fuck position, basically on all fours on the bed holding my stomach. Anything else would hurt more. I genuinely thought like, my stomach ruptured or something, and I was 99% sure that I was going to die. Lasted at least 2/3 consecutive hours. Er doc gave me antacids. Didn't do shit. (I was still on PPIs this entire time. I was doing what I was instructed to do.) Couldn't touch ice cream for a good while.

Doc gave me what I now know was Rifaximin for 6 days, followed by alternating antacids after every meal and esomeprazole for a week. Rifaximin made me irritable and pissed for that week but it did clear the gi issues up. I was completely fine until December 25th (yep) '24. (I barely ate that day because of it so it wasn't the cause). I was actually surprised that I was ""bowel healthy"" for maybe the first time ever? At this point I was tracking my symptoms and medication/supplements like a maniac on g calendar since April, more and more detailed, even journaling. 

Anyway I had a less painful version of July's pseudo gastroenteritis, but it lasted 46 consecutive days. (Feb 8th) I could not find a correlation of any kind for neither the reappearance nor the sudden disappearance of the issue. 

Then around Feb 20 things started getting out of control for seemingly no reason literally overnight. Started with exhaustion and fatigue unrelated to sleep. Mental symptoms deteriorated. Vision issues (lasted around a week). I was forcing myself to work because the exhaustion was not going away no matter what. I was suddenly not sleeping anymore. Alternating severe to mild insomnia out of nowhere. 

March 1-3 I was so weak and dizzy I thought I was genuinely dying. Ears ringing, all symptoms of high pressure (wasn't high.), very high bpm. I was on and off magnesium and electrolytes because I thought they made my gi issues worse. My hunger also plummeted since. I remember eating a little popcorn on the 4th late at night and having almost immediate cramps so I made myself throw up from how much pain and bloat I was in. Couldn't digest things. It wasn't as bad the following days but still bad. 

Had to insist to get referred to a gastroenterologist (I probably took too long but I have trauma involving hospitals so it's hard). Gave me random blood work to do (no vitamin/minerals) and sent me off.

March 10th, I was looking at my notes yet again trying to understand why my body is collapsing, any kind of triggers, and went a little further hack. I remembered my pos doctor and the long term PPIs. Found out about Sibo as a strong possibility. For some reason I convinced myself that maybe the ppis were what started this. Or abilify, or both. Or rifaximin not being enough. I don't know. But I was extremely frustrated and desperate. Got some blood tests, 200 calprotectin. Insisted for a full vitamin/mineral and some more for suspected malabsorption, thyroid, didn't get all of it. 

I have low B12 and mid/low folate/B9. 50 iron and 18 ferritin. And it's high for me. Asked her for a prescription for some iron supplements again and she said ""no"". She just said ""I don't have any deficiencies"" and I should drop Vitamin D supplements as I could reach toxicity ( Vit D 58). I was put on them by my rheumatologist for fibro, as I was close to literally zero D. At this point I just thought she didn't give a shit. I think I'll just have to do this myself and get supplements online. She didn't check thyroid function or anything either.

I tried low fodmap, gluten free, no fodmap, fasting, antihistamines, removed all my medication and supplements aside from the 2 necessary ones. I slowly added some minor supplements back. I can't figure this out and I'm being treated like a crazy hypochondria. I just want my life back. I have so many things to do and I'm here constantly in pain, constantly wasting time on the toilet until my feet go numb and cold. I have chills and I can't regulate my temperature, I sweat a lot, I am extremely dizzy as soon as I stand up and feel like I might pass out. I drink enough water. No soda, no coffee. I basically force feed myself. Acid reflux is slowly reappearing. Adhd symptoms absolutely out of control, brain fog, no concentration, extreme mood swings and dissociation. I lost touch with reality and nothing feels real. My nails are brittle and my hair is breaking. I have random rashes and doctors just don't care at all. I keep asking for help but just get dismissed. Adhd medication is barely working at all now, as if it doesn't get absorbed. Sleep deprived. Strange cravings but still don't really like food. Losing weight because I'm eating a lot less. Don't smoke. Negative to parasites. Skin and hair got worse. I feel like I'm slowly dying. Sensitive to noise and light. I think about suicide regularly just because of my health. 

I'm extremely frustrated and I don't know what to do. And I just want to know whether I'm crazy or not. I can't even function or think properly so I probably forgot something important. There's so much conflicting information online and I tried what I could aside from more supplements. Can't find breath tests in my area for some reason and a bit further away they seem very expensive, but I don't even know what I'do after that. I feel stupid and unlucky and I can't get help. I wonder if I'm missing something.

Super long post and the TLDR might need a TLDR lol

TLDR

-Set up an account and register your vehicle in Plug Share and.ABRP (A better route planner) apps.  
-Under charge ports, choose ""NACS Adapter"" if your vehicle has one for Tesla chargers, but not ""NACS"" which would be Tesla only

-Set up an account and register your vehicle in any of the charging apps you identified are local to you and add a credit card before you need it.

-For long trips do the same drill again and add any charging companies you don't actually have locally but would have on the road

-Set up an account and register your vehicle in the Tesla app and add a credit card so that the app only shows you compatible charging stations

-Test charging with these apps at the different charging brands stations when you don't really need it

-After successfully charging using the apps set up Ford Pass plug and charge and test that

-Ford Pass plug and charge does not carry through any discounts.  The basic low pricing you have from simply registering in a charging app, memberships, or time of day discounts some chargers offer when you use plug and charge

Caveats:
-It's very possible that all my seamless experiences are because charging systems in Central Florida and the Ford Mach-e charging and Ford Pass app bugs have been worked out in previous years

-Central Florida near Tampa has a lot of different brands of level 3 chargers available which may not be the case near you

-I'm in the south where it's warm weather and range does not get affected often

- Recently I also started plugging the mobile charger into 120V outlet at night for an extra 30 mi range at 12 cents/kwh

-If you commute large distances there and back daily for work and never have time before work or after work to charge.  Or there are no chargers near you with restaurants near the chargers so you can't go to lunch at Chipotle and charge for 30 minutes while you eat a burrito.  Those are situations where this doesn't work

-Rent an EV possibly a non Tesla-MME, Polestar, etc and see how charging is by you.  Most EV rentals will not let you use the Tesla adapter in the first place so it'll give you an honest assessment of your area.  You could then estimate more chargers if you get a vehicle compatible with the Tesla adapter

= =

Do we have an MME charging FAQ? maybe it's the other EV subreddits like EV charging.  But charging FAQ specifically for charging our Ford 
Mach-E (MME)?

This is a long post of my experience with DC fast charging only.  In case you have a situation where you won't be able to charge at home and are deciding if an electric car would work for you.

I've had my MME four months, have not set up the L2 home charger yet since I'm moving in a couple months. 

Before purchasing my MME, I had read a lot about charging issues on the road with Level 3 chargers like Electrify America not working.

Actually rented a model 3 for a few weeks just to see the charging experience and see where other chargers were located. I recommend you do the same.

= =

I'm in Central Florida and none of what follows is a brag but just my experience of things working good at level 3 DC fast chargers and what I did to make sure they worked as best I could.  Maybe this will help someone new.

Even though my work commute is not that far I just enjoy driving my Mach-e whenever I can. My mom lives in the next county it's a 60 mi round trip half hour each way not a bad trip but gives me opportunities to charge on the road.  I will stop at any charger haven't used before to see if they work for me even if I'm close to 65%

Apps I've used, recommended by everyone in other threads of course: 

PlugShare 
A Better Route Planner (ABRP)
supercharge dot info (website)

Any of the charging apps of course:
Electrify America
Tesla
EVgo 
EVconnect 
Blink (found these at the Ford dealers)
Other ones near you?
These are all level 3 DC fast chargers of course.

I don't quite mess with L2 out in the world except my supermarket has one free L2 charger if open, I get 2 mi of range added for the half hour I shop.  A pretty fair trade-off lol

I only had one first time charge not work, at an Electrify America station.  But it was a charger issue, the fuel pump had not closed off the previous charge session.  I called their service number and gave charger number, they reset the pump and my app worked.

The Ford Pass app [plug and charge] caused some confusion since it didn't work right away.  It seems like you're supposed to charge at the specific brand charger one way or the other (swipe card, use their app) the first time and then the second time Ford plug and charge should work.

One of the simplest solutions is to set up these apps with credit cards a few days before you even go out there.  Make sure your vehicle brand and model is definitely added to the app as well.

Because my car was new I was diving into the different apps the first week for the learning experience.

Then go to these chargers when you don't need to so you're not in a rush, and see if their app works.  Then the next time at that brand,  try to see if FordPass plug and charge works.

I think most of the apps, Electrify America and others don't work right away if you try to set them up while you're pulling up to the charger.  

Of course all of these chargers also have their own weird problems where you pull up and they're not working anyway. Or working but won't start charging.

Ford Pass, Plug Share and other apps should show you if a charger is operational before you drive that way.

Tesla is it's own confusion point as well, since you can't charge the MME at V2 Tesla spots.  So even though you see a Tesla spot near you it may not be the correct one. 

I have a Tesla charging station so close that I could walk to it from my house.  Obviously that doesn't make sense why would I leave my car behind to go to the charging spot lol. 

But point being I passed it a dozen times before and thought it would be great with an NACS Adapter.  Turns out that the station was V2 and only works with Tesla vehicles.

Once I created an account and added my vehicle to the Tesla app that location didn't show up as useable anymore.  Again it did show up on some of the apps like Plug Share until I put my vehicle type in and correctly chose ""NACS adapter""

The Tesla V3 & V4 are the charging stations we can use.  V3 typically has short cables and only a few spots you can use without taking up two.  
V4 spots have the longer cables but I noticed I still had to pull close to the charger right up to that protection pole sticking out of the ground. 

The website supercharge (dot) info is an independent website that attempts to have all the Tesla sites show on a map.  It also shows all the upcoming V3/V4 builds.  When you click on a charging location it will show if it's V2 V3 or V4.

Plugshare app is one of the best to show you all the different charging stations near you.  It worked better once I created an account on it choosing my car vehicle, type of charging port, plus that I had the NACS adapter. You can filter for high speed only to clean up the map of the L2 slow chargers.

Make sure Plugshare and any routing apps have an option to choose ""NACS adapter"" not the regular NACS choice.  NACS will show you every Tesla charging station, as if you had a Tesla.  But ""NACS Adapter"" will show only the newer Tesla charging spots that work with your vehicle if it can charge with the NACS adapter.

I downloaded every charging app that was in my area electrify America, EVconnect, EVgo, Blink, Tesla and a couple others. 

I created an account with an email on each app, choosing my vehicle, and adding the credit card.  I have one credit card I don't use for anything but EV charging to make it simple.

One or two of the apps wanted to take 20 bucks from my credit card and have like a credit in advance so I did not put my card on those I forget which brands.

Before turning on plug and charge in the Ford pass I went to all these chargers and tried them with their own app. 

For whatever reason they all have worked seamlessly first try.  Maybe because the credit card had a day or two be verified? 

And there's still the option on some of the charger's to use a credit card from the screen if you didn't set up any accounts or apps.  

That's a challenge here in Florida since most touch screens you aren't able to see from the bright sun.  And this was still true even when you try to shade it with a book lol.  And I was only trying to see charging speed those times.

I set up an account on the Tesla app with my email, added my vehicle and that I had the adapter.  This is different from just downloading the Tesla app because when you put your vehicle in it'll only show you the chargers that are compatible with the adapter. 

Again, added my credit card and tried the Tesla stations. 

Only then did I set up plug and charge and try that process with Ford pass.  I had previously of course set up a credit card in Ford Pass lol. 

But once I was doing plug and charge, I found that FordPass charges you the highest rate that the charger has locally?

Even without paying a monthly fee to any of these apps for their discount programs, I found they were about a nickel cheaper per kwh using their app than the Ford Pass app was charging me.

Especially since some of the Tesla stations near me have time of day pricing. I can get 18 to 25 cents/kwh if I go there before 8 am.  Ford charged me 46 cents/kwh at 7:00 in the morning at a Tesla station and that was one that had morning discount rates.

When set up and tested previously, ""App and Charge"" only takes a minute more than Ford pass plug and charge

To get past range anxiety a bunch of times I've run it down to 15% and pulled in at home uncharged. The next morning went before 8am to one of these Tesla stations to charge from 15% to 85%.

As far as charging etiquette at a busy station, I usually unplug at 80% unless the station has a few spots open.  If not busy I let it charge to 85% unless I'm pressed for time.

Recently I saw in the PlugShare app that there were Level 3 chargers from a brand called EV Connect in a hospital parking lot near my mom's house.  It was 38 cents/kwh even at peak time which isn't the greatest.

But this still meets my ""is it close to my Honda CRV fill up"" -$3 a gallon of gas x 12 gallons tank was 36 bucks a fill up.  A full 91kw charge at this station would be around 35 dollars. But Electrify America is 56 cents/kwh and would be about $51 to charge so I avoid them whenever possible.

When I saw that location I downloaded and set up the EVConnect app, added my vehicle and credit card.  I forgot about it until I passed that fuel station a week later.  I was at 60% and didn't need it but wanted to test it out anyway.  Again, the car is still new to me and charging is still fun. 

As I pulled up there was an MME in the other spot trying to charge.  He was on the phone with support having trouble charging.  We talked for a second he said I don't think the charger you pulled up to is working I said okay I'll give it a try and call support if not.  

He also said he was from Davenport which is close to Orlando Florida (we were 30 mins from Tampa proper).  He said he was paying $0.60/kwh at the chargers over there.  It must be because it's tourist area so 38 cents/kwh was great for him.

EVconnect had a QR code on the charger that I scanned from their app and it was good to go.  I plugged in and charged no problem.  

I think he had support reset the pump I pulled up to before he moved his MME to the other pump, so maybe that was helpful for my experience.  But support reset the other pump he had moved to and it finally worked for him.

At this point I consistently plug in the Ford mobile charger to the 120 volt outlet at night to get 30-40 miles of range added at 12 cents/kwh from the electric company

And I mostly charge early in the morning before 8am to get that $0.18/kwh from Tesla.  I also found another Tesla location that's $0.33/kwh even during peak.  

The only problem is most of the compatible Tesla chargers in Central Florida are at Wawa gas stations.  So any savings are offset by breakfast sandwiches and coffee or lunch meatball subs with a coke lol.

If you lived in an apartment here you could definitely run just DC fast chargers and try to charge cheap by getting up early. Or still consistently charge close to the cost of a gas fill up.

Any attempt at charging when you're at 5% and late for work just doesn't work with EVs obviously but that seems to be the only situation people think about who have gas cars.

I have a long distance trip planned about 5 hours each way next month so hopefully everything I have experienced locally will work on the road.

I'm going to specifically map that out with A Better Route Planner to see if there's any chargers along the way that I'm not registered with.

I'll pull off and charge every 30 minutes just to report to you guys. lol jk

I took in two kittens, one boy one girl. Gotten from a friend of a friend. I’m unsure on exact ages but we are thinking around 8 weeks going off the fact they do have all their teeth(what I read, I hope I’m right) They are, I would say med hair, white and grey, unsure on exact breed. 

I got them Nutro wholesome essentials kitten food and they started eating it right away no issue. I give them 1/4 cup each 2-3 times a day. (depending on if they didn’t finish all of the first or second serving)

I would say pretty much since we’ve had them, which is one and a half weeks now, Cid (the boy kitten) has only had two poops that were solid. The rest have been more pudding or straight liquid. I don’t see any blood, coffee ground look, or worms. He goes about 2-3 times a day and does always makes it to the litter box to go.

Additional details would be-
1. when we first got them I did them some temptations kitten treats. I think milk flavored ones. But after a few days of him having diarrhea, we stopped. His sister didn’t like them, so only he was eating them and since only he was having diarrhea we thought that could be it. But it’s been about a week now and it hasn’t stopped.
2. He still does everything else the same as his sister. Eats, drinks, runs, plays, and doesn’t sleep more than her.
3. He does have a little crud around his nose. They both have some dark eye boogies but only he has some on his nose I try to gently wipe away.

We do already have a vet appointment for the 31st for first check up and shots. Unfortunately we are not able to get in there sooner. I just want to double check is there anything else I can be doing or feeding him. I’ve have cats before but never kitten kittens. So any advice would be appreciated.

Pics of kitten, I can include bathroom pics I just didn’t want to add them if they were not requested

I sent it over last Thursday (6 days ago), the afternoon after meeting them in the morning. Polite thank you, expressed interest in working there, and attached resume.

I am a bit frustrated because they didn’t even respond with a “thank you, nice to meet you as well. Will reach out if we decide to add headcount”

I am wondering if it is appropriate to follow up tomorrow, I just want some sort of acknowledgment or to pass me off to someone else to meet with. Is it annoying to follow up or bad? This is a weird scenario because there isn’t an actual job available currently , I am just continuing to climb the chain of command and meet with more and more people who have all said I would be a great fit and they are likely to add headcount this year 

Please let me know as the anxiety is driving me crazy ",1,1743011561.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False
1jkhz88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1jkhz88/why_we_cant_let_glengarry_glen_ross_go/,Why We Can't Let Glengarry Glen Ross Go,"When I read that there was a Broadway revival of [David Mamet](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12636883/david-mamet)'s *Glengarry Glen Ross* starring [Kieran Culkin](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12638425/kieran-culkin), [Bill Burr](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12645679/bill-burr) and [Bob Odenkirk](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12124772/bob-odenkirk) opening this month, I was ready to book a seat on the next flight to New York. Then I saw that tickets to the sold-out show were reselling for over $1,000 each. That's when I closed my 32 Chrome tabs and decided that it was more economical to rewatch [the 1992 movie](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/movie/pp12666426/glengarry-glen-ross), which is currently free to watch on Plex.

It's a dialogue-heavy machismo movie about slimy salesmen. It includes derogatory language, toxic masculinity, and more than one cancelled celebrity. Rewatching this box-office bomb, I wondered why we, as a society, feel such a strong connection to this Pulitzer-Prize-winning play turned movie turned play again. How, of all the movies of the 1990s, is *Glengarry Glen Ross* the one that not only still has staying power but is also deserving of a 2025 revival? Why can't we let *Glengarry Glen Ross* go?

https://preview.redd.it/ysrr2errn2re1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=274562242ef89623a7eec4ba80c907c7069591dc

I think the answer is our continued romanticization of capitalist culture; the derogatory perspective of people in power; that fear continues to motivate us; our desire to assert our autonomy as workers; the camaraderie we feel as labourers; and the crushing reality of our capitalist system. Grab your brass balls, because I'm here to unpack all of this in about 1,200 words.

By romanticization of capitalist culture, I mean our shared belief that this system, although tough, will work in our favour one day. If I work hard enough to reach the top, I will get a reward. This hope is symbolized twofold in *Glengarry*. First, there is the new Cadillac, a prize for the top salesman in the office. Secondly, there is the character of Blake ([Alec Baldwin](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12637113/alec-baldwin)) who is sent from the downtown office to motivate these schleps into making more sales. To these downtrodden working men (and they are all men), Blake represents what they could be if they work hard. Baldwin was in his early 30s. He looked handsome, masculine, and in control—the physical representation of what capitalism could do to you. Despite all of the other salesmen being older than him, he still represented everything the men wanted to be: stellar at their job, ruggedly handsome, and driving an expensive car.

https://preview.redd.it/xuosummun2re1.jpg?width=1296&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05c9377cd9a72064ae6ea7421552267f2805b4bf

Blake does not think as highly of the workers he's sent to motivate. Quite the opposite. He's downright disrespectful. This is another key indicator of *Glengarry'*s staying power. I often notice, these days, how those in the upper echelons of society look down on the working class. Whether that be Elon Musk's crusade against working from home, Trump's assertion that illegal immigrants are all criminals, or the well-documented mistreatment of Amazon employees at the hands of their king Jeff Bezos. Blake shares this same derogatory perspective against the workers who can't close sales like him. In his now-infamous speech, he calls them terms I dare not repeat here, as well as ""weak"" and ""shit."" He won't even let them drink coffee because ""coffee's for closers."" Although on the surface he looks like he's demoralizing the workers, I think, in this instance, Mamet is trying to establish hate as a motivator for the salesmen. By making Blake so despicable, so hated by the workers in the office, while also so superficially appealing, he's creating a motivator for them. If someone calls you weak and shit, you'll want to prove him wrong. Kind of similar to what Musk is doing with DOGE. If he called your position redundant or a waste, you'll want to prove that your job is not a waste—and you'll prove that by working harder than you've ever done before. It's a system that preys on our desire to impress others and assert our own self-worth.

https://preview.redd.it/f64kopuvn2re1.jpg?width=590&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=659dafab72439ff424c6b83f03fc6e93bb0c6f2b

When we're not motivated by hate, we're motivated by fear. Within that same speech, Blake reminds the salesmen of what they're working for: The Cadillac. But, ""Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired."" Considering there are only four salesmen in the office, the implication is clear. These days, fear is still a very strong motivator. With inflation making everything more expensive and real estate prices at an all-time high, the motivation to work a decent job for decent pay is fuelled by the fear of not being able to afford the cost of living. If I don't work, what will happen to me? Move back in with my parents, and live like a loser for the rest of my life? The fear of what my life could become without the 9-to-5 grind is greater than the prospective rewards it may bring. If I were to get fired, I don't see myself becoming a self-motivated entrepreneur. No, that's not where my mind goes. I only see a million negative possibilities. And I'm a young guy—the guys in *Glengarry* are much older, with [Jack Lemmon](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12637353/jack-lemmon) being in his late 60s when it was released. Imagine where these guys' minds go when they think of being fired.

Hate as a motivator is a double-edged sword. If workers are meant to use their hatred of you as motivation, it may work in the inverse and cause them to work against you. You say ""fuck you"" and I say ""fuck you"" back because I want to assert my autonomy. I want to prove that I'm an individual and can't be bullied into doing my job. This is what happens in *Glengarry* when Moss ([Ed Harris](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12637284/ed-harris)) proposes to steal the new leads and sell them to their top competitor. Not only would this be a good payday for Moss, it would also be like giving the middle finger to Blake. It's a wonky interpretation of this modern phrase that I hear at every job: ""Work smarter, not harder."" This adage works well until you start thinking that you're the smartest guy in the room, like Moss does.

https://preview.redd.it/9uo8fglxn2re1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=702453c0558a98fdf733a9aaeb921bf980124c1d

It's not all bad. The silver lining is the friendships you build along the way. Sounds corny; let me explain. Although a guy like Blake might have better hair than me, a nicer car and a fatter pay check, he is also a lone wolf, while the workers like Moss, Roma, Shelley, and George are a band of brothers. They get shit on by the boss and the higher-ups, but they get shit on *together*. They form a bond that the bosses can never be part of. This is most clear in the scene where Roma ([Al Pacino](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12637587/al-pacino)) must convince James Lingk ([Jonathan Pryce](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12636930/jonathan-pryce)) not to back out of a sale. Lingk arrives at the office distressed, and Roma devises a fool-proof plan that hinges on a performance by Shelley (Lemmon). Together, they convince Lingk, the person lower on the food chain, that he can't back out of the agreement. Shelley, as Roma's partner, goes along without any questions asked. This camaraderie is not shared with their regional boss Williamson ([Kevin Spacey](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12637618/kevin-spacey)). While Shelley requires very little briefing and immediately falls into character upon Roma's hasty request, the whole charade is lost on Williamson, who ruins the sale with his big mouth. I think that this sort of worker solidarity can be found today on social media, where memes and discussions connect us through our shared misery of the working experience. Often, these jokes come at our boss's expense, but what do we care? Those who get it, get it.

https://preview.redd.it/tiefc1bzn2re1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe306d5e8302361000cf9b97c0dd076f241477f1

At the end of the day, a job's a job. Everyone has one. Everyone serves somebody. As such, work becomes a great connector for humans, like shaving, shopping or sleeping. I think that's one aspect of *Glengarry* that cannot be overstated. This universal connection of work, often marked by dissatisfaction, is what makes this story still so relevant. [Alan Arkin](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/celeb/pc12637125/alan-arkin)'s character, George, sums it up best at the end of the movie when he laments, ""Oh God, I hate this job,"" before picking up the phone and making another sales call. The director cuts to a closeup of a moving subway train before the credits roll, implying the continuing motion of the capitalist cycle. Despite our reservations about our work, we really have no choice in the matter. Whether we like it or not, everyone's gotta work.

Hopefully, this clears up why a story like *Glengarry Glen Ross* remains as relevant today as it was in 1985 and 1992. This is also probably why tickets for the new Broadway revival are going for over a grand each. It's the same reason why shows like [*The Office*](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/tv/pp12384034/the-office) and [*Severance*](https://www.peliplat.com/en/library/tv/pp31492274/severance) are so popular—we're all connected by our work. I'm still trying to understand why we work all day, complain about our work, and then go home to watch a show about work. You'd think we'd want to watch anything but a reminder of the worst part of our day, but I do it just like everyone else. After a long day, I sit back and watch six angry men call each other names over a job that means little to nothing. That's the beauty of *Glengarry* and the harsh complexities of our capitalist society.",0,1743011516.0,Broadway,6,0.5,False

We went on a lovely date last week, and I asked if she’d be interested in a second one she agreed. However, I’m currently traveling and told her I’d message her when I return. She’s amazing, but her dating app label says she’s only looking for “fun dates.”

Before my trip, I also swiped on another woman, and we matched after I had already left. We hit it off really well, and she even asked if I wanted to grab coffee, to which I agreed. Now, here’s where things get interesting… turns out, they’re friends. Small world, right? What’s even crazier is that the first woman actually mentioned the second one during our date.

I don’t want to create any drama between them, and I’m fully aware that I’m not their only option. That said, I do like both, but I recognize part of me might just be thinking with my dick.

1jkhwdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkleUncensored/comments/1jkhwdy/gwyneth_goop_and_other_garbage/,"Gwyneth, Goop and Other Garbage","Yesterday, another tired clap back from the trained seal. I thought to myself: why did the consciously uncoupled but very deliberate nepo princess decide to do an Instagram with Markle? And so the digging and following the money began. 

First, I found out Gwyneth Goop really put their foot in it during her own Netflix special. 


""Goop, and by extension Paltrow, have faced backlash for showcasing expensive products and promoting medically and scientifically impossible treatments, many of which have harmful consequences. The controversies have included vaginal steaming,the use of jade eggs,a dangerous coffee enema device, and ""Body Vibes"", wearable stickers that were claimed to ""rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies"" and which Goop falsely claimed were made of a NASA-developed material. Goop settled a lawsuit regarding the health claims it made over the jade eggs.""

""On January 24, 2020, Netflix released The Goop Lab, a documentary series. The 6-part show promotes Goop, and covers pseudoscientific topics in energy healing, the use of psychedelic drugs, cold therapy, anti-aging, mediumship, and female sexuality. Critics argued that granting Goop access to Netflix's platform was a ""win for pseudoscience"". Upon release of the first trailer, and again after the full six-episode series was available, the series sparked controversy concerning the medical and scientific misinformation it presented.""

""Gwyneth Paltrow has been urged to stop spreading misinformation by the medical director of NHS England after she suggested long Covid could be treated with “intuitive fasting”, herbal cocktails and regular visits to an “infrared sauna”.

The Hollywood star, who markets unproven new age potions on her Goop website, wrote on her latest blogpost that she caught Covid-19 early and had since suffered “long-tail fatigue and brain fog”."" (And we all know how Markle feels about people with brain fog."")

Then I dug in further due to Paltrow's former time in the UK. Ahhhhhhh....... Paltrow is either really stupid (a true possibility) or has moronically tried to put herself in a position of emissary to the RF. Why? Here is what I found:

Save The Children : Patron Princess Anne. Gwyneth Paltrow is an ""Artist Ambassador"". There is 0% chance here and Gwyneth must be prepared to lose this charity. 

Thirteen Lune:  thirteen lune is an e-commerce destination designed to inspire the discovery of beauty brands created by Black and Brown founders that resonate with people of all colors. It reframes how Black and Brown beauty brands are perceived not only from an industry perspective, but also for the consumer giving each brand a platform to educate and engage a wider audience.

""Nyakio Grieco, the co-founder and CEO of beauty retailer Thirteen Lune, has been accused of fraud and embezzlement, according to a civil lawsuit filed in a California superior court.""

In the lawsuit, venture capital firm Relevance Ventures—which invested about $3 million in Thirteen Lune last May—outlines 17 complaints against the retailer, including misappropriating company funds, aiding and abetting securities fraud, and breaching fiduciary duty.

The plaintiffs allege that Grieco embezzled at least $165,535.25 in company funds for personal and family expenses, spending more than $7,500 on Taylor Swift concert tickets, $20,000 on flights, $15,600 on a family vacation to Mexico, $13,000 on cellulite removal treatments, $8,700 on Amazon purchases, and $6,000 on a trip to Providence, Rhode Island, to “celebrate her daughter’s acceptance to Brown University.”

So essentially, this company is under investigation and April 2025 is an important date regarding the lawsuit.

Gwyneth's meditation app:

The ""Moments of Space"" controversy revolves around Gwyneth Paltrow's meditation app, which has faced criticism for its perceived focus on wellness and mindfulness, as well as concerns about data privacy and the app's marketing tactics. 
Here's a breakdown of the key points:
1. Gwyneth Paltrow's Involvement and the App's Focus:
Gwyneth Paltrow's Role:
Gwyneth Paltrow is a prominent figure associated with the ""Moments of Space"" app, known for promoting her wellness brand Goop. 
Wellness and Mindfulness:
The app emphasizes mindfulness and meditation, with a focus on ""eyes-open"" meditation. 
Data Collection and Tracking:
The app's privacy policy states that it collects personal data, including location, physical activity, and usage data. 
Marketing Tactics:
Some critics have questioned the app's marketing strategies, suggesting they are designed to attract attention and encourage downloads. 
2. Criticisms and Concerns:
Data Privacy:
The app's data collection practices have raised concerns about privacy, as it tracks users' location and activity. 
Perceived Focus on Wealth and Privilege:
The association with Gwyneth Paltrow and her wellness brand has led to criticisms that the app caters to a privileged audience. 
Marketing and Nudging:
The app's use of ""nudges"" to encourage meditation has been criticized as manipulative. 
Lack of Transparency:
Some critics have questioned the lack of transparency regarding the app's development and the voices used in the guided meditations. 
Effectiveness of Meditation:
Some critics have questioned the effectiveness of meditation, suggesting that it may not be a panacea for all problems. 
Comparison to Other Meditation Apps:
Some critics have compared ""Moments of Space"" unfavorably to other meditation apps, such as Headspace and Calm. 

""However, some specialist media outlets have begun to predict the end of Goop’s golden age. While the company continues to make headlines for its provocative products, it has recently been embroiled in legal issues. In March, it was revealed that Goop had been sued by the sexual wellness brand Good Clean Love for trademark infringement. The lawsuit stemmed from Goop’s launch of a line of sexual wellness products called good.clean.goop, which Good Clean Love argued could confuse consumers due to the similarity in their names.

Six months after the lawsuit, which is still ongoing, Goop faced another setback in September. “Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop slashing 18% of workforce to focus on beauty products,” reported several American outlets, including Women’s Wear Daily, a leading fashion industry magazine. “Goop has been trying for a while to be known as a wellness company, selling all types of products and advice that some may think is odd or non-mainstream. It was faddy. Fads don’t last,” said the executive director of the New York public relations agency HeraldPR in an interview with The New York Post.

A Goop spokesperson declined to provide specific revenue figures, but said revenue grew year over year in 2023 and was on track to grow again in 2024. Goop Beauty revenue is up 21% over last year, and G. Label revenue is up 45%, she said. The spokesperson declined to say if the company is profitable,” the media reported."" Hmmmmmm.

Bottom line? Gwyneth is winding up a dying swan and Markle thinks she'll be stepping in. Both ignore the people they rip off. Both are Marie Antoinetting in a society burning down. ",1,1743011328.0,MarkleUncensored,0,1.0,False

My name is Kai/Mocha, I’m currently on the hunt for some roleplay partners for a MxF pairing. Specifically, I am looking for someone capable of writing a well-written male character against my female character. Though, I am also open to doubling but please do not get upset if I decline as sometimes I’m in the mood to only focus on one pairing rather than two. Don’t be afraid to ask, but don’t give me an attitude about my answer either.

Currently, I am searching for modern romances that has tropes such as Grumpy x Sunshine, Golden Retriever x Black Cat, Opposites Attract, Slow Burn, Forced Proximity, Cowboys/Ranches, Coffee/Bakery Shops, Dislike to Lovers, Childhood Friends to Strangers to Lovers, Small Towns, Touch Her And Die, etc. I have some ideas for plot and would love to get into that privately, however don’t be afraid to bring your own ideas if you feel they fit my interest.

A little about me;

* 25F, married and uninterested in anything other than writing and maybe a friendship. (We don’t have to be friends if that’s not your style!)
* Ghost friendly and patient, don’t be afraid to let me know if you’re not interested anymore or want to start something new.
* 13 years of roleplay experience. Consider myself ‘advanced literate,’ replies ranging from 350 to 1.5k words depending on scene and partner comfortability. I tend to mirror as well. Third POV, past/present tense. (First POV is ok!)
* Loves playing characters that are adults living their lives outside of school with real-world problems. My characters are typically 25+, and I would like to stray away from college-themed plots.
* Eastern Standard Time, generally not available in the PM.
* Able to reply Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Never Saturdays and Mondays, usually not Thursdays. Depending on your reply pace, I’m able to get 2-3 replies out per day.
* I am open to rapid-fire sessions on Sundays ONLY, and need to be scheduled in advance. (Typically a week in advance, lasting anywhere between 2-4 hours.)
* Can write via Reddit Messages (chats for plotting please!,) Google Docs, Discord, and Emailing. Whatever floats your boat!

What I’m searching for in a partner;

* The ability to write 350 or more words per response, no less please. Third POV preferred, but first is okay!
* Patience and understanding, but don’t be afraid to end our roleplay if you find my schedule to be too slow or not meeting your standards.
* Capable of writing a well-written male character that is 25+ in age, though I do love writing against older males if that interests you!

I used the fancy technique of jostling the branch they’re on with a five gallon bucket attached to a telescoping pole. 

I collected as many bees as I could last night before I lost the light. 

Collected quite as few more as soon as there was enough sunlight, and while I was inside sipping coffee, the remaining bees left the tree and after a bit of swarmy chaos, settled into the hive with their sisters. 

I wasn’t planning on chasing swarms this season, so my empty boxes are not as clean as they could be. 

I’m in Oakland California in a little neighborhood of modest 1920s craftsman cottages. Everyone has backyard fruit trees, and flowers bloom all year ‘round.

1jkhmeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1jkhmeu/did_i_fuck_it_up/,Did I fuck it up?,"
Backstory: (32F) I just started working at a new job this past January. This is a male dominated field, so I’m surrounded by a lot of guys all the time. Most of them are younger than me and I don’t really pay them any mind… but there is this one guy. He’s super cute, nice teeth, fit, basically my type to a t. I would also say he’s probably like 26/27, so younger than me. 

Strawgate: This past Monday I got to work, parked my car, and went to the elevators. There was another dude who held the door open for me to where the elevators go from the parking garage to offices. I knew there was another guy in there, but I couldn’t really see him. Once the elevator arrived we all got on the one. I look up and it’s my office crush staring straight at me. He said something along the lines of “hey, what’s up.” I panicked and just said “Hi” back, broke eye contact, and took a sip of my coffee. Well I forgot that I grabbed one of those twirly straws that is heart shaped. You know, the ones you give to 8 year olds and they make that weird sound when you drink….. 

So there I was drinking from a twirly straw in front of my crush. Once the doors open I rush off and he goes one way and I go there (we’re on opposite sides of the office). After I sit down and start to work, I convince myself that it’s a great idea to message him on teams… 

Me: Please ignore the heart twirly straw. I grabbed it confidently this morning and now I regret it  [🙃] 

Him: I thought it was cool, normal straws are boring!

Me: Well thank you! I will continue on with my straw confidence then lol
*WHY THE FUCK DID I SAY THIS- couldn’t tell you* 

He doesn’t respond 

NEXT DAY - I’m talking to the girls in the office and *we* decide that I send him another message 

Me: Didn't have the confidence to even grab a straw today let alone a twirly one

Couple hours later (he was in a lot of meetings) 

Him: Boring! Maybe I'll get a twisty straw so you don't have to go solo

Me: What color are we thinking? Gotta coordinate the vibe.

Him: Feels like blue would go over well, I'll let you drive on that though

Me: I take my straw game very seriously. I can pick the color but you have to pick the design. Can I trust you with that? It's the arguably the most important part.

Him: sounds like a plan 

I didn’t reply from there. 

So I know this is so cringe and painful to read, but I have to know… did I fuck this up? Do you think he’s into me or nah? 

If he doesn’t send me a message, should I just hide from him until the end of time or eventually say something else?

We also don’t know if he’s in a relationship or not. You know the office girlies stalked him but all of his socials were private besides LinkedIn.

It was hard to give up the bread, cereals, grains, but.. not that bad.  I can avoid them pretty easily.

After almost a year with ups and downs on carnivore, with some things getting better, somethings...not.  I had brought my diet down to only meat, eggs, cheese, cream, butter, etc.  Meat and dairy.

I still kept having stomach issues.  

While talking with my wife, my son asked, ""dad, are you that thing where people can't drink milk?""

Nah, not me.  I've never had trouble with cheese... right?  Or butter?  No nausea.  No stomach cramps from a glass of sweet cold milk.  No problems with heavy cream in my scrambled cheesy eggs.

And then I decided to stop all dairy.  Holy. Moly.  That has been difficult.  Dairy was a MAJOR part of my life.  My whole life has been a lie.

It wasn't spicy foods that gave me an upset stomach, gas, cramps, poop issues.  It was the cheese.

I stopped eating dairy almost 3 weeks ago.  My stomach issues have gone completely away. Gone. Nada.  No issues.

I ate a non-carnivore bowl of hot peppers 2 nights in a row just to see if they caused a 'problem.'.  Nope.  Nothing at all.  My body can't do dairy.  

Without dairy though, this diet gets a lot tougher. A. Lot.

This process helps them burn calories and prevent them from developing health problems such as obesity. There are a variety of food options that can help people lose weight, but here are seven to start with.

1. Chile peppers

A compound known as capsaicin can be found in dried or fresh chili peppers, which can help boost metabolism and decrease appetite.

2. Ginger

Studies have shown that this spice can help lower one's body weight, boost good cholesterol, and lower fasting glucose levels.

3. Eggs

Eggs are full of protein, which can help boost one's metabolism due to how it requires more energy to digest it than carbs or fats.

4. Lentils

Peas, lentils, and eggs all contain protein, and they're also good sources of fiber, which can help feed beneficial bacteria in the gut.

5. Caffeinated coffee

Studies have shown that drinking coffee can help boost one's metabolism and energy expenditure. However, it's important to avoid overdosing on it, as adding a large amount of sugar and cream can negate its benefits.

6. Green tea

A 2013 study revealed that drinking four cups of green tea a day can help reduce one's body mass index, waist circumference, and blood pressure. In addition, this drink can contain various other health benefits, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.

7. Brazil nuts

Although Brazil nuts are full of protein, healthy fats, and minerals such as selenium, they're not ideal for everyone. The daily recommended intake of selenium is around 55 micrograms. However, anything over 400 micrograms can cause toxicity.",1,1743010242.0,EDrugstore,0,1.0,False

i’m back in school this week and fasting and ramadan has been the hardest ever. especially today, i have a exam tomorrow, im hungry and so tired it’s only 1pm and i left my lecture on the verge of tears. idk what it is. i’m really tired of fasting. i really just want a coffee at the least and to be able to study for my exam tomorrow. im so disappointed in myself also for speaking like this. i feel ungrateful.  others don’t even have food to break their fast let alone eat during the day. while others are in their grave wishing they fasted. i’m really close with my deen and I love Allah i love Islam. i’ve always been devoted. i just can’t believe i have this anger today. 

yesterday i was so physically unwell. i’m not sure why, it was hard to even stand on my feet. i was mentally exhausted as well. it was so hard to go through the day with my classes. i come home feeling so faint to find my parents are going to the emergency room because of something with my brother. i offered to cook. i usually cook and everyone loves it. i cooked, it felt like i was on my last life. i was so dizzy, felt heavy on my feet like the blood was rushing to my feet. i cooked literally food that i know everyone likes. something for us kids and then for my parents. i prayed sitting which i don’t even think is permissible but i really felt like death. you don’t understand i’ve never felt like that before and i truly believe i was gonna pass out. 

i layed down and don’t even know i fell asleep and woke up like two minutes past iftar. my siblings didn’t eat and said my food didn’t taste like it usually does. okay? like i thought it was good but maybe since i was sick i didn’t cook well idk. but they ate other things. we don’t even have dates anymore because we ran out and my dad said ramadan is over in two days we’ll be fine. so i broke my fast and still was feeling so horrible. i was thinking that id get the usual relief. i didn’t. my parents came home and my mom was complaining about my food, that it wasnt saucy enough, it wasnt spicy enough. just ridiculous things as if it wasnt cooked like a hour ago from a extremely tired person. i told her that. i went to sleep so sad. that i gave myself while i was feeling like that expecting everyone to be happy and no one was. 

woke up this morning hungry. which it’s never this bad. i had suhoor so idk what is going on. so today im irritable. i’m fighting back tears on campus. i feel like a immature child. i shouldn’t feel like this. i’m stressed. i feel like i couldn’t focus in school this month. i feel like a failure. and honestly i was having these horrible thoughts of breaking my fast today. may Allah forgive me. 

please if anyone who’s kind and won’t judge me and make me feel worse to message me and just help me understand my feelings or get through today? i would really appreciate it as your sister in islam.

There was an episode of silence from her that made no sense that had me thinking - she is going senile and it wasn't the first spell of silence from her.  

Then I started to oeioce together other stuff. 

She was easily angered and went on rants that made no sense.  This was the biggest one. 

Her nephew died and she just lacked empathy towards her sister and became anti social about his funeral service.  

She had comprehension that was waning. She understood the virus but she never understood all the measures we had to take to minimise spreading germs.  She is someone who happily sneezes and coughs into an open room, my face, meals with no comprehension to cover potential germs. 

I was piecing all of these together three and half years ago and only more and more things has appeared. 

She eavesdropps, snoops and takes and even takes my intimate items of underwear.  This is a big one because it's so wrong.  To go and steal underwear that wouldn't even fit her.  There were many pieces of my underwear. 

Her cognitive functioning is poor.  Like planning and organising is poor.  Spacial awareness is poor.  She's easily bored.  She has some obsessions.  She was never OCD when I was younger. 

There is a lot of things that reminds me of autistism too. 

She doesn't talk to me properly any more. She will never ask me how I am and what my schedule is like and how my day is, how I slept.  Just general chat. She will only ever ask me did I hear from any of my brothers. If it's not this it's orders that don't make any sense and often with a bad tone to it.  One of her obsessions is filling the dishwasher every day but then never ever starting it.   So loads of dirty dishes gets put into the dishwasher and then most days she will pick out her favourite items to handwash them.  So if I load the dishwasher she gets angry at me and orders me not to start it til it's full.  This stuff could be there for days and days and the machine is often full and as full as it's going to be and there's that.   I often have to agree with her and then I usually manage this behaviour but doing this chore myself at night time after she's gone to bed.  

There's so many things that just dont make sense. 

I don't have a diagnosis because the last GP cited ' any memory loss?' to me.  

Her memory seems to be very well althought there has been some things over the past few weeks that are now questionable.  

Every morning after breakfast she does the same thing where she gets apced out attacking chores around the house.  But this is every day of the week.  It's not a very bad house by the way in terms of mess.  I just think she's bored and idle and OCD.  It can be scary because she's utterly spaced out in her own world.  

Once a week she may go into town on the bus but sometimes not and then that behaviour is 2/3 weeks running every day.  

I don't critisise my mother and the work she's doing around the home by the way but there are a lot of 'what the F--K' moments. 



I live at home due to a housing crisis. I was always happy to help at home and keep her company too.  

But lately, I am not happy. My mother scares me in that there are days she won't even speak to me and she's spaced out in her own world being somewhat OCD-ish attacking chores that again don't really make any sense. Like really being OCD with cleaning the toilet several times a day, likely being paranoid.  Cleaning the windows outside several times a week when really there's no need to that so often.    

 Where am I supposed to go in a housing crisis. It's very bad where I am by the way. 

I work usually Monday to Friday. With Saturdays and Sundays usually off.   Sometimes there's a change to that but that's typical for me. 

Three and half weeks ago on a Saturday morning, we were both up and the first thing she asked me - 'did you hear from any of your brothers'.    I told her no but in that moment I went to my room, packed a backpack and left for the whole day until nighttime.  It just hurt me so so so so much and I couldn't face another day being at home with that coming out from her mouth followed by likely a day of silence or anger from her.   So I left for the whole day. 

Then in Sunday, I did the same thing again. 

Then the following weekend and last weekend I did the same thing again.  I just got up and left. I packed supplies with me for the day like my water bottle, my medicines, my knitting and I just sat in establishments with some tea/coffee/food/drinks with my knitting for hours on end until it was time to go home to bed. 

This is likely unsustainable will likely hit me in my pockets and fiance's eventually. 

Just this morning I got an invitation in the mail for a mid week function and my heart just sank.   It's a function where I will likely have to budget approx 150 for drinks/alcohol for the day and provide about 100 for a cash gift.  

I hate the idea of this function so much because it's mid week and it's going to take a chunk of my finances away.  But most importantly, I would love to keep this money for my weekends.  I should be happy with an invitation but I am dreading it.  

Unless would I be able to budget by buying small bottles of vodka in my grocery shop and carrying a bottle in my handbag so that I wouldn't have to spend as much at a bar at the function and also during my weekends around the city.  

I love finding bars to sit in with my knitting and just ording a drink or two.   

TL:DR 

I don't have a diagnosis for my mother but I strongly suspect dementia and FTD likely and I am finding things very difficult and I keep trying to nearly run away at weekends.

1jkhcau,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jkhcau/am_i_stuck_on_my_calorie_deficit/,Am I stuck on my calorie deficit?,"Hi guys,

I am not novice to gym, diet and everything but from 6 months I started to take care of myself for the first time without a coach/personal trainer/nutrition expert.

I am a male, 70 kg (154 lbs) x 162cm (5.3' ft).

I am probably a skinny fat since my body fat is 25% ish.

I am following a calorie deficit of 500 calories ish.

I eat 1460 kcal on rest days and 2140 kcal on gym days.

I give myself an off diet day once a week where I can eat max 2100kcal of whatever I want, always trying to reach my protein intake (150gr of protein).

On my rest days my macros are 115 carbs / 160 prot / 40 fat /// Gym days 195 / 210 / 58

I do take isolate whey protein and creatine everyday, both mostly after workout also, coffee and one banana pre-work out.

I work out every other day (so one week 3 times, other week 4 times).

My split is the following:

1st day - Chest / Triceps / Abs / 200kcal calories cardio at 150/160 bpm

2ndst day - Back / Biceps / Abs / 200kcal calories cardio at 150/160 bpm

3rd day - Legs / Shoulders and biceps\* / Abs / 200kcal calories cardio at 150/160 bpm

\*I train biceps more because it is my favorite muscle.

During this split I train each big muscle with 14 sets ish, “secondary” muscles (such as biceps/triceps/shoulders) with 8-9 sets.

I train mostly to failure (RPE 8) with rest time between 60 and 90 seconds.

My expenditure per workout is on an average of 450kcal (1h30m of workout) + 200kcal of cardio.

The next months I will try to take my weekly trainings from 3 to 4.

Am I doing everything okay? Am I on a good path?

At the beginning I was 73kg ish, for sure I lost fat but now it seems I am stuck on 70kg, I see more muscle though and weights are increasing every 2 weeks.

I would like to lose more fat. Should I continue this diet? Should I track my body measurements too?

Any thought or advice? Thanks to everyone :)",1,1743009983.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

1. Does the coffee bean even matter for Filter coffee? If yes, which one? 

2. Is chicory the secret ingredient for a perfect cup? Becoz, cothas have chicory (15%) however, mokkafarms doesn't (80% arabica, 20% robusta).

3. Do you guys prefer buying filter coffee powder? or grinding coffee beans?

4. Can I still make a great cup of coffee using other brewing methods? All I have to add is the milk and sugar to make a similar coffee like filter coffee, right?

1jkh8mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1jkh8mt/career_and_life_help/,Career and life help???,"Just looking for some advice- 

I am 24, I graduated about a year ago from college. During my schooling, I understood that I needed a niche to guarantee a job right after graduation. I was able to get a fellowship hosted by SHOWTIME, leading to a mentorship under the creative directors of the trailer making department. I secured an internship in LA at a trailer house after graduation of which I am currently employed at. I moved out to LA to ensure I would get hired. 

During school, I was okay with moving forward with editing as my career, since I would be okay with hating it, as well as I enjoy it enough to feel rewarded by what I make. I enjoy moving scenes around and using cool music to see what I could create, and I don’t mind receiving feedback when working on my projects. 

However, when I got into the company, they hired me at the bottom level with the promise that I would be able to move up in the company. They initially promised 6 months to a year before I was moved up from the starting position. I would be getting lunches, dinners, doing dishes, delivering equipment, opening doors for people, getting coffees, shipping mail and moving drives between companies. I was totally fine with that, as it made sense to me; prove yourself to get what you want.

So I worked! I did what they asked for the first 6 months and then I noticed a bunch of promotions happening within the company. I was repeatedly told that when one person moves up, people below do as well, and that’s what I was seeing.

I went to ask my future boss if there was any chance I would be included in this moving up, as this was happening around the time frame they gave me to expect, and I had received all good things concerning my performance in this role thus far. 

He told me that they were looking to hire somebody else for the next position rather than me, because they “didn’t want for me to get swamped by the work”, since I would be the only person in the role, whereas there are usually at least 2 people. I asked why I couldn’t be moved up along with them hiring someone else and they said because they didn’t know if the person in that current position was even going to get moved up in general. They then told me that they think I could have been doing more to prepare for this role, listing tasks that I do not have access to. I had been shadowing, and completing what I could concerning the next role, yet the criteria he listed was stuff I just objectively did not have access to.

It hurt, and it made me realize that I can’t put all of my eggs into one basket, and should always keep an eye out for other jobs and continue learning just in case. I started pursuing my music career more seriously and began developing my photography portfolio. I started looking deep within myself and asked if this was really the future I wanted, even post getting the promotion, would I be happy? I see these people in office at all levels of their career and see them at their best and worst, when they dump crazy OT into a project and when they spend nights sleeping in the office.
I don’t know if this is what I want for myself and my future.
This is a comfortable job, I get benefits and I have potential to move up, but it would require big amounts of OT to prove that I want that future for myself. I have never had a problem buckling down and dealing with tougher tasks in order to secure a stable future for myself, but I honestly don’t know if I would feel fulfilled or genuinely happy as an editor. They spend most of their days at work, and have very little social lives outside of work. I’ve found that I enjoy traveling around and interacting with people, hence the photography aspirations. I feel like if it were photography, I would be feeling different. 
I talked to HR and ultimately got told to be grateful and that a bunch of people apply when they open up a position along with alluding that they didn’t have to hire me. They also made statements that suggested that I was not doing enough to learn for the role despite me staying after/showing up early for shadowing, and completing what tasks I had access to for the next role. This rubbed me the wrong way, as it was continuing a narrative that I did not do enough, when it is more of a case that these people who assume that come into office 2-3 times a week and aren’t present when I’m putting in my extra work. They don’t stay after and they don’t consider that I am doing what I need and more, but instead it feels like they are assuming and running with that assumption. I don’t know though. 

I know I’m young, and I feel like there could be things to this that I’m not seeing, and because of that I’m not running off recklessly, but instead trying to carefully diagnose everything to accurately progress forward. I don’t care about being a famous editor, I don’t care about the money it would bring, I just want to be able to work somewhere without having risk of an aneurism. (My mom is a nurse and she warned me that my frequent headaches were abnormal and possibly stress related, and that this could be a possible outcome should nothing change.) 

I was told recently that I would move up on the 31st, and then I received a message from my future boss saying that they wanted to “reiterate” that I would be moving up April 7th or the 14th instead. 
Just to be clear; I DONT have an issue with dates moving around, or promotions getting delayed or denied. It shook me up at first, but that’s not what really bothers me. 

It’s the way people have been ACTING. I don’t appreciate being told that I am not doing enough when I don’t have access to complete the tasks they are suggesting. I don’t like being told to be grateful when I am doing what I can to show that I am grateful, working later, continuing to complete these tasks, and I REALLY don’t like how people in the company began to dismiss me as the time went on. People who used to be friendly would walk right by and not say anything, some would avoid my line of sight, but few kept being friendly. I appreciate those people.

So in conclusion; I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be reckless and burn a bridge here, but I also don’t want to condemn myself in a field that I may not find fulfilling, or even worse, a field I hate.  Photography or just switching jobs in general is a gamble, especially in such uncertain times, but my bones feel like despite possible struggle, I would be okay with it because at that point I took an active choice for happiness, rather than for survival.

As you can see from the previous post I mainly ate meat, then I added a lot of butter to it to reach the 2:1 fat/protein ratio and for the last week I mixed it up without seeing any results. Now, after 7 months of very few improvements (which could be attributed to stopping eating processed food and quitting coffee) I am getting very desperate as this is not the low-energy state I want to be in for the rest of my life.

As I still have diarrhea even on a 1:1 fat/protein ratio (with our without dairy) I was looking up that it might be my gallbladder not releasing enough bile to emulsify the fat.

* Would you recommended supplementing with bile sale for a while (if so how much per day)?
* Do you have any other recommendation on how to proceed with this (as I to want to have a lot of energy, lose weight and feel overall healthy and enjoy life)?",1,1743009590.0,carnivorediet,19,1.0,False

The few times I've left early or been on vacation, I return to a sink overflowing with dishes because—shockingly—no one else thought to run it. I swear, if I dropped dead tomorrow, they’d just start stacking plates on my desk like a shrine. I even have to clean the coffee machine every morning because my boss, who leaves last every day, doesn't have the common decency to empty out the old coffee and clean the filter.  Not to mention, everyone leaves coffee grinds everywhere, loose-leaf teas in the sink, and never wipes down the counter or the microwave after their smelly food explodes all over it. I walked into the office after lunch and it reeked of fish! Seriously?! 

And mentioning food, don’t even get me started. My coworkers love bringing in pastries and baked goods for the office (our office is right above a bakery) which would be great… except I have celiac disease. And despite me mentioning this SEVERAL times, it’s still a surprise to them every single time. My boss will literally walk in like, “Hey everyone, I brought treats! Oh… sorry, you can’t have any.” Every. Single. Time. Like bro, why even say that? Just to rub it in? Just let me suffer in peace!

So we have two kids, a three-year-old and an 8-month-old. My husband works in a different timezone, so he starts work at 6 am. That means that I am solely responsible for both kids in the mornings. My three-year-old goes to preschool, so I have to get him fed, dressed and out the door by myself, while also watching the baby.

And...I'm losing my mind. Luckily my husband works from home so I don't have to pile the baby in the car to take her with me, but my patience is just so thin in the mornings. I wake up to the baby crying for a breastfeed, or my toddler shouting, ""Mom!"" and then it's nonstop them needing stuff and me being the only person who can help. I know that's parenthood, but on the weekends, it doesn't bother me, it's the time crunch of getting to school that kills me. I just feel so overwhelmed by it.

It's compounded by the fact that I'm a morning person and mornings used to be my time. I would wake up early before anyone was up, have my coffee, read the news. I know I'd have to give it up when we had kids but it's been so hard to lose. I'll definitely try to wake up early again, but the moment, the baby still wakes up once a night to breastfeed and I'm just too exhausted to do that yet.

Any advice, words of wisdom, things that might help? I'm getting cranky with my toddler, who's just doing normal toddler things (dilly dallying, wanting to play, etc) and it's not his fault.

1jkgqwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jkgqwc/while_all_this_should_work_on_paper_i_just_dont/,"“While all this should work on paper, I just don’t have feelings for you”","A few months ago, I (24F) started taking Taekwondo lessons. Through that, I started making friends and became friendly with a guy there, (31M). We chatted before class, during the little break we have in between, and when I was out for a while he walked over to me as he was leaving (I was waiting for the next lesson to start) and enthusiastically asked me where I had been. 

After a while, my friends encouraged me to ask him to lunch as we frequently left class at the same time and I was heading to lunch by myself anyways so I wouldn’t mind the company. After that, we went on a few more after class lunch outings and he asked me to go see a movie with him. This movie ended up being on Valentine’s Day. He’s very sweet, smart, we have a similar background, and similar political affiliations so he was checking a lot of boxes for me. I was excited to be dating as I don’t date often, I’m focused on my graduate school program and work, but I was hoping it would lead to something special. 

Fast forward, we’re hanging out more often, we talk everyday. When he went on his business trip, he kept sending me pictures and brought me back a little gift. I visited my family in Puerto Rico during this thing and brought him back some coffee as he loves coffee. We went on two more dates, both lasting around or over 24 hours as we would go back to each other’s places to play games, watch TV, and would eventually end up falling asleep together after talking for hours. Although the physical attraction was there, due to personal reasons on both our ends, we never had any sexual relations. Only heavy make outs. 

Well, as one does, I noticed a shift in our texting and I felt the flirting was coming heavily from my side. I chalked it up to him being busy, but yesterday he mentioned we should talk about us. He came to my apartment, we chit chatted for a bit and then the conversation started. 

The part of the conversation that stuck out to me the most was him saying “And while all this should work on paper… I just don’t have feelings for you and I don’t think I will”. I’m caught in this loop of feeling grateful for the fun we had and the maturity he showed me by coming to my apartment to have this conversation in person rather than text. But the other part of me feels kind of blindsided as I thought we had mutual feelings for each other as he had previously said he liked me a lot? He went on about my positive qualities, how I have nothing to be insecure about, how I didn’t do anything wrong, it’s just… chemistry and molecules… we’re always making bad jokes towards each other and mine was “Well, you might have a career in acting because you had me fooled”

He didn’t really understand what I meant, but made a comment on how he’s a bad actor. I was able to talk over the phone with my friend and he made me feel a lot better. While I know I will get over this and it’ll be just another dating story, I feel really sad as I thought this was going somewhere else. He recently embarked on this new religious journey and is still figuring himself out with that so I going to chalk it up to that he just needs to be by himself and I respect that. He even told me if he needed to train on other days as me to make things easier on me that he would, and I appreciate that. 

But it doesn’t make this hurt any less. I’m very reserved when it comes to dating as I’ve had a string of bad experiences. I think I also need to take this as a lesson for myself to stop getting attached so quickly or stop moving so quickly. This is the second time a potential relationship has ended with the guy telling me “I think you’re awesome, really cool, blah blah blah” and it’s just so annoying to hear the same shit over and over again. But… I know it’s part of the process. 

Sabrina Carpenter’s music is going to help me through this… I know I’ll be alright and who knows what can happen in the future (I’m not expecting anything). But, it’s going to be weird (at least for me) as I’m going to pull back a lot and things will return to how they used to be where we chatted before class, during the little break, and then go our separate ways. He still expressed wanting to stay friends with me and as much as I would like to be friends, I don’t think I can at the moment. At least nothing past friendly pleasantries when we see each other in class. Maybe in the future we’ll go back to chatting and being friends outside of class, but I need to distance myself right now so I can process and get over him. Dating is tough and I can’t let myself slack as I’ve got a lot to do for my program but now I feel drained and unfocused. 

As Sabrina says, “I’m so mature, collected, and sensible. Except when I get hit with rejection. To turn me down… well that’s just unethical”. So… I’ll stay a busy woman and do what I need to do. I know the right person will come along eventually, but the process to get there is tough. Just looking for some kind words and support.

Coffee takeaway is also asking for TIP AMOUNT on the machine , I mean seriously ! And then every robot is off and these guys managing the traffic but how can I possibly tip 5 Rand every second robot from Fourways to Sandton everyday ! 

I do tip a lot and make change for everyone and  do my bit everywhere I can for humanity but honestly I feel this is getting out of hand ! Tip is a bonus of good acts / performance or generosity not a requirement. ",27,1743008309.0,askSouthAfrica,38,0.91,False

1jkgjus,https://www.reddit.com/r/exvegans/comments/1jkgjus/i_said_i_would_go_back_to_being_vegan_but_i_never/,I said I would go back to being vegan but I never will,"I was homeless and vegan and the meals they served me were simply not okay to live on and be healthy. So I decided to go vegetarian during this time, then there were moments they had no options, so I just slowly reintroduced meat. 

I always said once I lived on my own I would go back but I haven’t and I won’t. 

I enjoy not obsessing over labels (!!!!) I enjoy being able to take the food that is offered to me. I enjoy being able to go to grocery store without it being heavily restrictive. I eat a lot of veggies and try not to over consume meat products in general. 

I used to work at a coffee shop and freak out over all the milk we used. I used to be judgemental and feel isolated that not everyone shared my vegan views and “didn’t care about the animals”. I felt like it was negatively affecting my mental health. 

I just don’t feel guilty anymore after dealing with so many humane issues. I don’t agree with animal welfare but I’ve decided that battle is not mine to have and to do what I can. I don’t feel like a bad person because I consume animal products. Fruit, beans, etc. are often picked//laboured by low income or immigrant workers. 

I respect people being vegan but I do feel the community is toxic, doesn’t acknowledge the privilege around being able to go plant based, and can be condescending. 

Lastly, when I was receiving treatment for an eating disorder, the nutritionist told me that going vegan (at the time I was vegetarian) would not be a good idea and harmful to recovery. I understand what she meant now. I feel more freedom. * I am also not saying vegans who have eating disorders cannot be successful, this is just my experience * ",10,1743008081.0,exvegans,2,0.92,False

I prefer a black Gaggia as I don't love the thought of having a fingerprint magnet - but both seem to be nice looking machines to me from what I've seen online.

It appears the Gaggia has an extremely long and proven track record which I like (minus boiler gate), how is the build quality on Lelit?  The Lelit has a larger boiler, not sure if that will matter much for my use though Which would be 1-2 drinks daily? I would have no warranty with the Gaggia due to modding and the mods would cost around £130 from what I've figured out. The Lelit has is 57mm opposed to the standard 58mm which could be a little annoying from what I've read. Does one of them have a much better steam wand capability than the other?

  I’ve been working for the county as long as I can remember. I was once a deputy and rose through the ranks until I decided to hop into politics and run for sheriff. Everything felt the same for a while, even with people being just a bit nicer to me. It wasn’t until rather recently that things started changing. 

  The station had started getting more reports of murders. The county had never had a homicide problem, so it naturally sent people into a panic. I remember the first report. I was in my office, going through the budgets for the year. I looked up, hearing one of my sergeants running up the stairs.

  “Sheriff, we have a problem,” he said. I looked up at him, standing from the desk.

  “What is it?”

  “A body has been found,” he said. My eyes widened. I motioned for him to show me, grabbing my hat.

  We got in one of the cruisers and drove down to the scene. The drive was quiet, odd with him. Chase was always chatty, but even he was shaken up by this. Once we had gotten to the scene, we got out of the car and started walking to the scene. 

  It was out in the woods, away from anything else. Rural Tennessee really is a great place to drop a body. Surrounded by nothing but woods. What makes it worse is that the body was found in a cave. Chase showed me where everyone else was, letting me go.

  “I’m claustrophobic,” he says. “Sorry, sir.”

  I shrugged it off and went in. The cave itself wasn’t too close in, at least to me. There were other of my men down at the scene, investigators already down too.

  “Sir, the victim, was found by a spelunker named Tedd Thedore around 10 this morning. Multiple stab wounds and… burns?” the head investigator said, reading over the report. “At least from visual reports, still waiting on the report from the morgue.”

  I listened to every word he said. We walked over to where the body was found, the chalk outline on the ground. Yellow evidence markers dotted the ground, still close to the outline. I squatted down and looked at the markers.

  “What have we found?” I asked, looking at Kara, one of the forensic girls. She flips through some report papers.

  “Mostly caving equipment, personal effects, stuff like that. We’re still swabbing and dusting for prints or DNA, hopefully, the folks in the Dead Den can find more out,” she said. 

  “That’s better than nothin’, I said. I looked at the equipment. It was scattered, but everything seemed practically untouched. A light pack with mainly rope and rigs to repel down or up or… whatever. I don’t know spelunking stuff. I looked to the side, sighing softly.

  “Was he alone?” I asked. I hear papers rustling as Kara flips the pages.

  “No… Mr Thedore was posting online about the cave, and he said he was going in with a friend, and a caving dog. But we’ve seen nothing from or about either the other man or the animal,” she said. She came over to me and put her hand on my shoulder. “Sir…?”

  I looked up to her. Her eyes were soft, sympathetic. “We’ll find them, even if it’s just bodies,” I said. I didn’t like the idea of just finding bodies, but from the caves to apparently a murderer, we had to keep the options open. I would prefer live beings.

  I stood, making Kara back up. She handed me the papers, and I read through everything we had so far. She watched me as I read it over. I opened my mouth to say something before we heard a sound farther down the cave. It was faint at first, and I couldn’t be sure what type of sound it was at all. But as it got louder and closer, what it was started to click. A dog.

  A little dog, probably some Terrier mix, came running up to us, screaming its head off. You would have thought it had its tail on fire or something after it the way it was barking, but it looked fine and nothing was behind it. At least, it looked fine, and I’m no animal expert. It ran between me and Kara, using us as its shield. I got this weird feeling and a cold chill up my spine. 

  Kara picks up the little dog, shushing it and getting it to calm down. I looked at the dog, seeing if it had a collar or something on its vest. I found the collar and gently slid it around to look at the tag.

  “Damn…” I said softly. “No name.” Kara tilted her head. She looked at the tag too.

  “Huh… Not even a phone number or address,” she said. “It looks old, I think it may have rubbed the press out.”

  “Yeah…” I said. The thin metal of the tag had once been stamped with a name or address, but now it was worn smooth and dented in too-perfect spots. The dog shook in her arms, a carabiner clinking against the metal rings on its vest. I looked over the vest too, still nothing of use for an ID.

  “Maybe someone has reached out for a lost dog?” Kara said, her voice interrupting my thoughts. 

  “Perhaps,” I said. I looked down the way the dog had come running from, squinting into the darkness. From what I could see, there was nothing. At least, that’s more of what I was hoping for. I nodded to the other investigators and forensics team members before leading Kara and the dog outside. Chase was still out here, looking around the area outside and leading up to the mouth of the cave. He looked over and raised a brow at the dog.

  “Little thing came running to us like a bat out of hell,” Kara said, petting the dog. “No idea who he belongs to.”

  Chase came over and looked at the dog. It looked at him, sniffing at him a bit, but nothing else. “He still looks pretty good. Maybe he just ran in and got lost within the past day or two,” he suggested. Kara shrugged. I led them back to the car.

  Kara found a blanket in the back of the cruiser and wrapped the dog up as Chase and I stayed looking around the mouth of the cave. He asked me all sorts of questions as to what the scene looked like, and I answered what I could. I looked over the horizon, the sun starting to set. 

  “Come on, folks. Let's get out of here. No use running around a cave in the pitch of night,” I called into the cave. Everyone started filing out of the cave, eager to get out of there before nightfall. We’re in Appalachia, after all. We know what goes on out here in the woods in the dark of night.

  Everyone got back to their cars and most were off pretty quickly. Chase still wanted to look around more. Midwestern boy, so he doesn’t know what all goes on out here. I called out to him and eventually got him to pick up the pace and come back to the car. He got in, looking out to the setting sun one more time.

  “C’mon, Chase,” I said as I got in the driver's seat and shut the door. He got in.

  “What’s the big deal, Sheriff? Are you hillbillies afraid of the dark?” he asked.

  “No. But we are afraid of what’s in the dark,” I said. The look on his face was a mix of skeptic and almost horror. I’m sure hearing it from me wasn’t comforting either. Kara was in the back with the dog. She found some water bottles and managed to get the dog to drink. 

  I drive back to the station, making sure everyone got back. Chase got out, waiting for a second before turning back.

  “What do you think is happening here?” he asked.

  “Without much to go on? Who knows,” I admitted. “Get home. I’ll take Kara to get the dog to the shelter.” 

  He nodded and went to his own cruiser to get home. I drove Kara to the county-run animal shelter. She dropped the dog off and got back to my car. I was off in my own world, thinking about all of it when she came back, and she scared me when she got in.

  I sighed deeply, rubbing my forehead. She grinned a bit. I looked over at her. She gently punched my arm.

  “You know, you’re pretty jumpy for a sheriff,” she said.

  “They didn’t have anything in the job description about not being jumpy,” I countered. She laughed lightly as she buckled up.

  “Let’s get back. Can’t have anything getting our fearless sheriff,” she said, grinning a bit. I chuckled and shook my head. I drove her back to the station and dropped her off. She waved bye to me before she got to her own car. I waved back before driving home.

  I sighed as I walked into my house. I walked to my bedroom, took a shower, and changed clothes. I went and got a drink as I started thinking. First murder in the county. I actually wasn’t sure if it was the first one or just the first in a while. Either way, it was bad. And it needed to be solved, fast.

  I went and found something for dinner, something like one of those Factor things or whatever. I waited for it, still thinking, or at least trying to think. It was all too much and without knowing everything, it was going to be a while before we could get it figured out. But I knew once word of all this came out, people would be up in arms to get information.

  I had dinner and got things cleaned up. I finished my drink, getting more after. I went and sat down, deciding I needed to get my mind off of it for a while. I turned on “The Twilight Zone”. It’s probably not helpful at the moment and I probably don’t need any scary stuff, but it's a good show. I eventually fell asleep on the couch with the show still playing.

  I woke up to a sound outside, looking out the window to the rising sun. I sighed as I got up to go look and try to see what the commotion was. I could have sworn I saw a figure dart out of view as I got closer, just seeing the outline the closer I got to the window. I looked out the window and tried to see if I could find that figure again. A chill ran down my spine as I looked over the backyard. Nothing was out there. Granted, I’m sure I didn’t get good sleep, so my brain was tricking me with this or something stupid like that.

  I yawned as I turned back and turned off the TV, and grabbed my glass. I walked to the kitchen and put the cup in the sink, leaning against the counter for a second as I let myself wake up. I looked at my watch and realized I was going to be late. I ran back to my room to get dressed as quickly as I could. I got everything and ran out to the car.

  I hopped in and drove to the station. I got in and slipped up to my office without anyone noticing. I hoped and prayed no one noticed I had been late as I sat down. I sighed softly, checking the clock. Good, I wasn’t too late. I rubbed my face before I heard someone walking up to my door. I looked up to see Kara coming in with a thick file. She smiled softly.

  “Good morning, Sheriff,” she said as she handed it to me. I flipped it open.

  “Morning…” I said softly. I looked through the file. “That was quick…”

  “It was, but I’m afraid there might be mistakes since it was so rushed,” she said as she sat down in front of my desk. “But I can’t be totally sure about that.”

  I sighed softly. “Great…” I said. I looked over the file, looking at the graphs of the body and where the injuries were. I looked at the paragraph that detailed everything, time of death, wounds, and so forth. I hated to say it, but it wasn’t very helpful. I sighed as I closed the file folder.

  “I know… I looked over it earlier and there wasn’t much to really go on,” Kara said. I nodded. She leaned forward a bit, taking the file again. “I would say to go down and actually talk to the guy down there. You know he never leaves.”

  “Yeah… might as well,” I said. I looked up at her. “What do you think?”

  “I’m still trying to figure it out. The victim was burned and had 28 stab wounds, but in a cave by himself. And that doesn’t even get into what happened to the caving partner he should have had with him,” she said. “Unless the partner did it, but we have no reason to think that yet other than the fact he’s just gone.” 

  “Let’s not get into theories just yet. I do love a good theory, but those aren’t helpful at the second,” I said, a bit of a smile tugging at my lips.

  She smiled softly. She gently puts her hand on mine. “We’ll figure it out, Sheriff, and we do, I’ll keep you updated on everything.” 

  She took her hand back and stood, taking the file and heading out. She stopped at my door and looked back at me. “Don’t worry about it too much, Sheriff.”

  I nodded a bit before she left. How could I not worry about it? I stood and went to the window. I looked out, but I wasn’t seeing it as it started raining. Just then, I heard a call come through on the radio.

  “10-33, at the Hornets Station on Marble. Got a 10-54d.” came over the radio.

  “Again? There’s another dead body..?” I said softly. I grabbed my coat and ran downstairs.

  “Sheriff?” Chase said, getting ready to go on the call.

  “I’m going with you,” I said. “I thought the caver was the first, so a second this soon is something to be concerned with.” 

  “Are we sure it's a dead body…?” he asked.

  “It’s a 10-54d. There’s a body that got found, obviously. You did learn the codes, right?” I said. “If they’re not already dead, they’ll be dead by the time we get there if you keep yapping.”

  I pushed him out the door and to the cruisers so we could get there. We got into one of the cars and started down to the gas station. We got down, too much of a crowd in the parking lot, and only one other of my officers was there.

  Chase and I got out and ran over to the officer. He turned to greet us.

  “Sheriff. We got the report 20 minutes ago that a body was found as they were opening the station. They said the body was found out back after the opener guy noticed a smell of burning flesh and went to figure out what was causing it. He said he went out front first before making the walk to the backside of the building,” he said. I nodded as I listened to his tale from the gas station clerk. I sighed softly.

  “Lead us back to it,” I said. He nodded and took us back. I paused as I saw our morgue guy standing back there. 

  He looked up. “Hello, Sheriff. Must be bad for you to be showing up to calls now,” he said. “I was out for my morning coffee run when the fellow said there was a body. I figured I should come back to get a peek.”

  The way he spoke freaked me out. He freaked everyone out. The slow way he spoke wasn’t like the usual Southern drawl around here. It was… slower, more abrupt rather than melodic. I guess it made sense since he was the Dead Den guy. It still doesn’t make him any less creepy.

  “A-and what have you been finding out?” I asked, pushing aside my own feeling that he was weird. He smiled a bit. It was one of those twisted kind of smiles.

  “Without properly playing with the insides, primarily burns and stab wounds. Like the last victim,” he said. He looked back down at the body. “Almost the same pattern of it too.”

  A shiver ran down my spine. I nodded a bit. Was it really going to be a serial problem? The county has never had anything like this or even the first murder. And why are there burns and stab wounds?

  “Sheriff?” Chase said, having come around back. I looked at him, sighing softly.

  “Chase?” I responded. He motioned for me to follow him up front. We went inside the store, getting away from everyone else.

  “We’re pulling the security tapes, but it’ll be about a week before we get the tapes from the owners. They’ve always been pretty tight up on stuff like that. If you ask me, I think they’re part of some cult,” he said. I groaned.

  “Don’t start with any cult shit. We don’t even need the idea of it floating around,” I said, rubbing my eyes.

  “Sorry, sir,” Chase said, chuckling softly. “I’ll make sure the boys don’t get to saying it anymore either.”

  “Folks have already started with that mess?” I asked. He nodded. I turned and paced along the fridge doors. Now there are cult talks? How did we jump to that already, so quickly? Sure, the specifics of the number of stabs and even the burning do feel pretty ritualistic, but if it really was, would the bodies just be left out of anyone to find so easily? Of course we have so many questions and no answers. Chase puts his hand on my shoulder. I jumped a bit and looked at him.

  “They’re getting the body loaded up and everyone else is coming out the secure the place. What are you thinking?” he said. I exhaled, thinking. 

  “I’m not sure… I don’t want to jump to any one thing until we have a reason to think it’s connected or part of something bigger,” I said. “It could be something crazy or just coincidence.”

  “You don’t believe in coincidence,” Chase said.
  Well, there goes trying to make him feel better about it. I sighed and started to the door. “Let’s go back to the station. I have something to check out.” We got back to the cruiser and got in.

  “When we get back, go and check on the evidence lockers with the stuff we got off the caver. I’m going to see about anything in the morgue,” I said. Chase nodded. After that, we drove in silence back to the station. When we got back, we separated to get our tasks done. I walked down to the morgue, almost hoping Hannibal wasn’t back in yet. 

  “Sheriff,” his cold voice said out of his office. Shivers ran down my spine at his voice. I looked over to him. A twisted grin rested on his thin lips. “What can we do for you?”

  I hate the way he says “We” or any other plurals. It’s just him and the corpses down here. At least, I hope. I stammered a bit, trying to figure out my next words. Who knows, he might try to get into my head too.

  “I wanted to look at the bodies that have come in from the murder scenes. I want to cross-reference what you had put into the reports,” I said. He nodded slowly. His grin got wider.

  “Of course, this way, Sheriff. We are so glad to have you in today. We had wanted to speak with you anyway. We have noticed That the wounds on both bodies are the same,” he said as he led me back to the coolers. “The new boy and the caver. It seems you might have a serial killer, Sheriff.”

  “Lord, I hope not,” I said, quietly praying that it wouldn’t be true. I almost wanted to ask why anyone would be targeted here, but I know I would just have gotten a creepy answer from him.

  “It seems that was to us, Sheriff. But we have always wanted to work on a serial killer case, and hopefully find what makes them tick,” he said. I frowned a bit. He should have worked somewhere else, bringing them that bad luck. 

  “Well, you better stop hoping that happens here,” I said. He sighed a short “Fine.”, as he led me back to the coolers. As we went back, he was muttering to himself about some cult rumblings in the department and wider community. I didn’t want to hear any of it. I refused to believe there was anything as crazy as a cult wandering around this county. 

  Hannibal opened the freezers that held the bodies of Ted and Jack. I almost gagged as I finally saw the devastation of the wounds. Eyes were plucked out and lips ripped off.

  “You never mentioned this in the reports!” I said, turning to Hannibal. “Kara said the first report was rushed, but this feels like something that really should have been mentioned.”

  “Ah, yes. We were going to, but the lovely Kara kept pushing us to finish. We prefer a bottom-up approach to recording damage,” he said. The way he talked about her freaked me out.

  “Keep her name out of your mouth…” I said lowly. He seemed to ignore me.

  “She comes down here a lot, we think she might like us, at least a little,” he said. I glared at him. “But, no one likes us, so maybe we’re going crazy.”

  “You don’t say?” I said, rolling my eyes. I sighed deeply as I looked back at the corpses. I couldn’t be squeamish with this case. There was too much hanging on it, on me. I looked at Ted’s body first, looking over everything from the cuts and burns to anything that may have been there before the murder. I noted the ways each cut looked, deep cuts in his skin in almost a pattern, but of what, I couldn’t place it so easily. The burns also seemed very deep. I couldn’t tell exactly how deep, but it may have been so deep it was to the bone, maybe even in the bone itself. The way skin around the burns was charred and areas were peeling back and blistering. Now that I was looking at it, I remembered smelling that burnt skin and hair sort of smell in the cave, but it wasn’t as pronounced. 

  My eyes trailed up to his face, having been ignoring it because I didn’t want to see the horrors I just knew were there. I gasped as I looked at his face; most of his flesh was gone or at least charred. I couldn’t believe none of this was mentioned in the reports. I was starting to get madder and madder at Hannibal. It felt like he was trying to mess up the investigation. I pushed that out of my brain, praying that it wouldn’t be true. I looked over at Hannibal, who was looking away from me and muttering softly to himself. I wanted to hate him, wanted to just get away from him. I went on to look at Jack’s body next, everything being the same as on Ted. I couldn’t believe that someone would do this, nonetheless two times. I sighed as I turned around and closed my eyes, the image of the bodies and wounds forever seared into my brain. I would never be able to get those images out of my head. I never wanted to see deaths like those ever again, even ignoring the implications of a serial killer running around my county. Even with the theories of cults or whatever running around, I just never wanted to see any of it ever again. I could easily go forever without it again, but I’m sure anyone would rather never see a dead body. 

  Hannibal came over to me, smiling a bit. He broke me out of my thoughts as he cleared his throat.
  “Anything rattling around in the brain, Sheriff?” he asked. I jumped a bit as he spoke. I turned to him, shaking my head.

  “Well, yes… and no,” I said. I glanced back at the bodies, sighing. “I just don’t know what to think about everything. It’s all so much at once.” He nodded along like he understood. I swear he doesn’t.

  “Perhaps it was some freak instance,” he said. His trying to be comforting was anything but, and it freaked me out more. “Sure, it’s weird that it happened twice, but we really don’t have much of a reason to think it's anything else at the moment, do we?”

  I shook my head, figuring that’s what he would have wanted. “I should be getting back to my office if anything is coming up or something…” I said, just wanting to be away from him and everything about down here.

  “Of course, Sheriff,” Hannibal said. “Oh, if there’s anything you would like to put on the record about the bodies, we’ll write up new reports. Also, if it could mean anything, no one has claimed the bodies yet.”

  That last part bothered me as I quickly left and went back to my office, trying to wrap my head around all of it. I just couldn’t, so many things not making sense or lining up the way I thought they should have. 

  I sat down and put my head in my hands. I had a horrible sinking feeling that this wasn’t as small and as close in as it seemed. I closed my eyes, and that sinking feeling started to feel even more real. It felt like I was falling. I picked my head back up, panic setting in as I was surrounded in darkness. I looked around, and there was nothing but small pinpricks of light surrounding me. It felt so empty and cold, like I had just been dumped in outer space. I looked around, hoping and praying that something would bring me back to reality. But… nothing. Until…
  
  I heard a soft voice, a woman’s voice. She spoke in something I didn’t understand, but it sounded old, older than any human language. Yet, I understood. Even thinking about it to this day still sends shivers down my spine and terrifies me. I couldn’t even be able to translate it into English or any modern way of speaking. But… it was a dark promise, a promise that more would die under my watch, that I could not stop it. I heard the voice chanting my name, the pinpricks getting bigger and brighter, the voice getting louder and louder. I covered my ears and slammed my eyes closed. As it got louder, I started screaming.

Here are a bunch of items with very little theme or connecting thread. Enjoy.

# Cash Injection Popover

This is one of my favorite pieces and weirdly one of the longest running in my wardrobe from OUTLIER. Just wonderful luxury and also incredible utility. I would say without a doubt that this is the best shirt I have for hot and humid days. Air just pours through this and moisture wicks off of it. I never felt that this looked sloppy like linen or sticky like synthetic meshes. I would compare this to that chainmail feeling that Ramielust has, albeit in a much softer and denser feeling. There's still some opacity to it, but I think it's fine enough to not be off-putting. You absolutely can see my tattoos though it, but whatever.

[Cash Injection Popover, Futureslimworks](https://preview.redd.it/e8as7mv9c2re1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7dbfafc714a3fbcc19f61dd12469740412c4ca83)

What does become an issue is the price, which ironically feels somewhat normal by today's standards with the brand's experimentation. at $400 for a shirt, I was shitting bricks to wear this and potentially ruin it. Somehow no matter what I did to it, (coffee, food, etc.) the stains came out with no issue. I've basically earned whatever price per wear I wanted out of this and feel no more fear about possibly dirtying it. At this point, that's pretty much how most of my wardrobe is handled (clothes are meant to be worn,) but I think this one was a big stepping stone in getting over my babying of expensive clothing.

# Bombtwill Jobjacket

This jacket has vexed me a bit lately. It was incredibly useful to me last year as someone who did not have a big outer-layer type of jacket. This is truly a shell and offers very little other than wind resistance. It's quite roomy, so I would often layer three or four things underneath to actually develop warmth and then leave the Jobjacket on over top just for that final bit of weather protection. It wasn't much... I admittedly was not ready for the winter seasons when I moved out of Florida.

[Bombtwill Jobjacket, Injex Raglan, Bombtwill Tumblepig Dungarees](https://preview.redd.it/lcwpfr9ta2re1.jpg?width=1836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=021afc3bf47709be8941189f15ef044705f9d886)

Now I've had time to figure out how to best keep myself warm and I find myself rarely reaching for this. I wore it recently with just a shirt underneath and felt pretty meh about Bombtwill in this scenario. I really think it offers so little in this scenario and that maybe I was using it in the best way possible before. I think most of this mindset change has to do with my recent move toward natural fibers and how unpleasant it feels to return to the synthetics, especially for tops. Bombtwill still has a ton of character and is easily my favorite pant material, but it really lacks as a layer.

All of my doubts being expressed, I still cannot say enough amazing praise for the form itself. While it does resemble most traditional chore coats, I think the excess focus on massive pockets and interesting stitching (and in my jacket's case, color-blocking) keep me from wanting to ditch this completely. We shall see how I manage to pivot with this one.

# Warmform Henley

Maybe my most worn Outlier garment? How many times have I said that in these reviews? I love this material so much. It's thick, but light, and stretchy, but substantial, but warm, but breathable. Damn it's good. Again, I am still relatively new to needing this shirt at all climate-wise, but this past Fall/Winter, I wore it probably three or so days a week as my second layer. It never overheats, nor does it add much bulk to your layering. Really essential utility-wear for me.

[Acottontwill Two-Pocket, Stronghard Hooded Wamrshirt Warmform Henley, Bombtwill Tumblepig Dungarees](https://preview.redd.it/bw8qvvmza2re1.jpg?width=1836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0ba3424731c05911677e3d28bd048d2a1d365d0)

The henley itself is nicely cut to be just a tiny bit cropped but not too much that you would lose a tuck in your daily wear (the stretch is also very helpful in that regard.) The buttons at the top are nice to make it easy for taking on and off or leaving a couple buttons undone for visual intrigue when you get to shed your outer layer. I'm over here explaining a henley at this point, but the fabric is a no-brainer for the form is what I'm saying. I like the shirt.

# Acottonflannel Bigs

Super chill and cozy shorts. These won't really make sense for a lot of people since they operate on the level of being warm but not actually covering your legs. In reality, I'm reaching for these in the in-between seasons around the house. Acottonflannel honestly isn't even that warm either. I think the plush softness just gives the impression of cozy and the rest just works. They offer a bit more range of motion for sprawling out on the couch, but you don't feel so cold that the heater needs to be on in the house either.

[Uniqlo U Airism Shirt, Acottonflannel Bigs](https://preview.redd.it/0r05x9v3b2re1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3d769821af370b61be725fdeb13e6b2efadf2e4)

There isn't really much to say otherwise. I'm just rocking these on my lazy days. I do wish they'd run these back as I want to have more backups.

# Cottomerino Sweats

Super luxurious sweatpants. These are way too expensive for what I'd ever care to use them for. I'm already addicted to the Ramiefall Yes pants and didn't see the need to grab a pair, but curiosity got the better of me when a WTF trade worked out in my favor for these. I don't necessarily think these are life-changing, but they really do feel incredibly soft and dense.

[Manresa Chamois Shirt, Cottomerino Sweats](https://preview.redd.it/htrmx6wab2re1.jpg?width=1836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70ba956a4fbc45ef2c08b30812676f6dd3cdf05f)

The often made claims of feeling luxurious are pretty accurate as well. It's great to get them for a little deal as well because I feel no pressure to baby them and so far I haven't had any issues with durability either. I can see why OUTLIER moved on from the fabric, but it is nice to get a taste of luxury from the brand here and there.

# Slim Dungarees

The ultimate workhorse. This is probably my longest running garment from the brand in my wardrobe. Funnily enough, while I wore them a bit to start, they got shelved and forgotten until I picked them up again just to wear for work. They ended up being perfect for daily wear and aside from a few snags, have lasted me for 3 years of pretty consistent and stressed wear and tear. Now I'm finding myself wearing them on my days off as well.

[Yellow Label Co Chunky Knit, Slim Dungarees](https://preview.redd.it/87ma135gb2re1.jpg?width=1836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665b0d478a80766ca63d269cbae98b5a7049076a)

I don't know what changed in my perspective, but even at TTS, my Slim Dunagrees have bagged out enough to almost look like a straight, tapered fit rather than the original skinny thigh pants. It's a flaw with the fabric that no matter what, they will eventually stretch in high tension points (knees) and washing and drying won't bring them back to shape anymore. It looks unsightly on a few different forms, but in the wake of most pants being wider in trendy fashion, the Slim Dungarees are looking even better after so much wear. It makes me curious for the New Dungarees and if the fabric really is doomed, I might have to pick up a pair.

# Ultra Ultra Easy Shorts/Splitlines

Yet another product that costs so damn much for something you'd never think to pay so damn much for. So a few of these reviews have been about items where I felt there was a 'high-value/fear of ruination' factor going on and the Splitlines fit right in line with that. Luckily these were another WTF score for me so I just go crazy with em. To be honest, I don't really work out enough to justify them even at WTF cost, but I was immediately drawn to their utility. Always loved gym shorts with the liners built in and these are amazing with mesh pockets on each thigh and the material is satisfying. Also love the phone pocket on the back which has been secure throughout my runs. The Ultra Ultra fabric is nice too. Stays pretty dry, stretches and snaps easily, and is relatively light for how durable they are.

[Vintage Realtree Shirt, Ultra Ultra Splitlines](https://preview.redd.it/hq12y4tlb2re1.jpg?width=2605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a03d5cb2b1143f17dc0850958015c9fafcf3d5be)

I actually grabbed a pair of the standard Ultra Ultra Easy Shorts after trying the Splitlines, and while they don't have nearly the amount of flair and features that the Splitlines have, I still think they're pretty reliable and will stick around in my workout clothing rotation for a while.

# Grid Linen Towel/Hoodie/Beach Thing

This was one that I had to try after seeing so much hype and I am definitely a convert. This towel fabric does wonders for any activities where you:

1. need to pack the towel and move with it
2. would like it to dry quickly
3. do not aspire for plush comfort
4. potentially need to shed debris (mostly beach sand) off of it without hassle

All of those pretty much describe the benefits of Grid Linen and why I own like four multiple formats of it. The Beach Thing might be the wackiest of the bunch, but I get decent use out of it regardless.

[Grid Linen Hoodie, New Way 10-5s](https://preview.redd.it/g0mhql4sb2re1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a79931ec19aaa8f3a9731da448e2f798047e0a5)

I tried using them as house towels, but the lack of comfort is not ideal. Luckily, the newer Deepgrid stuff kind of occupies this space while making compromises on the traveling bit. Traveling with Grid Linen to the beach or backpacking has been pretty much the perfect niche where I feel like I didn't do an obnoxious purchase for minimal benefits. This actually rocks.

# Anyways...

I realize now that I've gotten to the end that the only products in my wardrobe left to review are tees and I don't know if I care to speak on them. Maybe I'll write more thoughts on OUTLIER products that have also exited my wardrobe over time, but likely that is going to be a long, long wait. We shall see. I suspect the next time I do a review it will be a recap at the end of the year. I'm already accumulating stuff from OUTLIER even as I explore more and more into other brands.

Thanks for reading. It's been somewhat tedious, but also meditative writing some brief thoughts on shit that I spend too much money on. As always, let me know if you have any questions or thoughts or anything whatever.

Until next time...

What struck me most was how many Redditors shared horror stories about ""skinny teas"" that were basically glorified laxatives—one user memorably described how a Chinese slimming tea made them ""crap out their soul,"" while others warned about bathroom emergencies and stomach cramping

Instead of these questionable quick fixes, I found that long-term tea users usually gravitate toward gentler options like green tea, white tea, and oolong for sustainable weight loss & healthy metabolism results

Drawing from both my personal testing and these candid Reddit discussions, I've compiled this no-nonsense guide to weight loss teas that actually deliver results without the digestive distress or empty promises that plague this industry

# What Are Weight Loss Teas?

Let’s keep it real: weight loss teas aren’t some magical brew that’ll make you slim overnight. Instead, they’re blends of natural ingredients designed to support your body’s metabolism, detox process, cravings and appetite control

# Think of them as a sidekick to your healthy habits, not the superhero itself

* These teas usually contain ingredients like **green tea**, oolong tea etc. which is packed with antioxidants called catechins. Catechins help speed up your metabolism, meaning your body burns calories more efficiently.
* Then there’s **matcha**, a concentrated form of green tea that’s great for giving you an energy boost and keeping hunger at bay.
* Some **slimming teas** also include herbs like **senna or dandelion,** which act as natural detox agents to flush out toxins and reduce bloating.

If you’re wondering why they’re so trendy, it’s because they’re simple to incorporate into daily life. You just brew a cup and sip it—no complicated routines or expensive equipment.

* **Caffeine Sensitivity:** If the tea contains caffeine (like green tea or yerba mate), it can lead to **restlessness**, **anxiousness**, or even **insomnia** for those who are sensitive.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Some herbal ingredients might trigger allergies, so always check the label carefully.

# How to Choose the Best Weight Loss Slimming Tea for Your Needs

After years of experimenting with various teas and reading countless Reddit threads on the topic, I've learned that selecting the right weight loss tea is far more nuanced than simply grabbing whatever has ""slim"" or ""detox"" on the label. Based on both my personal testing and the collective wisdom from real users, here's a comprehensive guide to finding a tea that actually works for your specific situation:

# What Reddit Users Actually Report Working

* **Combination Approaches**: Many successful users pair morning metabolism teas with evening anti-bloating formulas.
* **Realistic Expectations**: The most satisfied users report modest but sustainable results (1-2 pounds weekly when combined with diet changes)
* **Hydration Balance**: Some report better results when alternating tea with plain water throughout the day
* **Adjustment Period**: Many note initial bathroom frequency normalizes after 5-7 days as body adapts

# Ingredients Matter - Look Beyond the Marketing

* **Green Tea Catechins**: Specifically EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) - studies show it can increase fat oxidation by up to 17% when combined with moderate exercise
* **Oolong Tea**: Contains both catechins and caffeine in balanced amounts - many Reddit users report it helps with snacking urges between meals
* **White Tea**: Has the highest antioxidant content among teas with minimal processing - excellent for those who find green tea too bitter
* **Yerba Mate**: Higher caffeine content (85mg vs 25mg in green tea) for stronger metabolism boost - multiple users report sustained energy without coffee jitters
* **Dandelion Root**: Natural diuretic that reduces water retention without the harsh effects of laxative teas
* **Ginger**: Thermogenic properties increase body temperature slightly to boost metabolism while improving digestion
* **Fennel**: Helps reduce bloating and gas while providing a natural licorice-like sweetness
* **Peppermint**: Natural appetite suppressant that also soothes digestive discomfort
* **Cinnamon**: Helps regulate blood sugar to prevent hunger spikes - particularly effective for afternoon cravings

# Avoid These Red Flags

* **Senna Leaf as Primary Ingredient**: Creates temporary weight loss through water elimination - many Reddit horror stories about ""bathroom emergencies""
* **Proprietary Blends Without Amounts**: If you can't see how much of each ingredient is included, the effective ingredients may be present in minimal amounts
* **Extreme Claims**: Any tea promising ""10 pounds in 7 days"" is likely relying on dangerous laxative effects
* **Artificial Sweeteners**: Can trigger hunger hormones and cravings in some people

# Finding Your Personal Match

* **For Morning Energy & Metabolism**: Look for green tea, oolong, or yerba mate bases with ginger or cinnamon
* **For Afternoon Cravings**: Peppermint or rooibos with chromium or gymnema sylvestre
* **For Evening Bloating**: Fennel, ginger, or chamomile without stimulants that might affect sleep
* **For Water Retention**: Dandelion root, nettle leaf, or hibiscus without harsh diuretics
* **For Stress-Related Eating**: L-theanine-rich teas like high-quality green tea or specific formulations with added adaptogenic herbs

# Beyond the Tea Itself

* **Brewing Temperature Matters**: Green and white teas lose effectiveness when brewed with boiling water - aim for 175°F/80°C for optimal catechin extraction
* **Steeping Time**: 3-5 minutes maximum for green tea to prevent bitterness that leads to sweetener addition
* **Consistency Over Intensity**: Daily consumption of moderate-strength tea outperforms occasional strong brews
* **Timing Strategy**: Drinking 20-30 minutes before meals maximizes appetite-suppressing effects

I hope these tips and evidence-backed elements help you get the best tea for your situation, and you're much more likely to find a tea that supports your weight management goals without the disappointment (or bathroom emergencies) that come with the heavily-marketed ""detox"" options.",2,1743007445.0,HealthTrendz,0,1.0,False

All the coffee goes through before I have time to stir it,"Hey all, I just received an aeropress go due to a bunch of suggestions on r/camping and I'm trying it out for the first time today. I watched the video, read up on the manual. When I pour the water into the coffee, I hardly have time to stir it before it all passes through the filter into the cup. Anything I need to consider? 

The one improvement I made on brew #2 was to put the plunger in at an angle, to stop the coffee from dripping via vacuum. The very first time I did it, I pushed the plunger straight in, and  most of the remaining coffee shot through to the cup.. 

But it still remains, the coffee is seeping through pretty quickly as I stir. This feels like a design flaw, but I'm not sure what I don't know, so I'm asking here. ",4,1743007415.0,AeroPress,21,0.75,False

-a reel of a walk-through of our building

-progress photos of the renovation we did/the history of the building (it was built in the 1800s and used to be many things, including a grocery store. Also, it has this weird cellar thing that we were told was part of the underground railroad)

-a reel of that ""things in my place that ✨️make sense✨️"" trend. I know this trend is kind of outdated, but we have a lot of random quirky things that I think would go well with it

I’m on day 53 of my weight loss. I eat well nutritionally and everything and eat within calories BUT I do use up calories of bad food sometimes. I’ve never fully removed that from my diet. Like I’ll eat a lot of whole foods, home-cooked meals, snack on fruits, and only drink water and coffee. Alcohol is fine, like I have it very occasionally on some nights out but no issue there.

However, I’m not getting enough protein in and I haven’t started the gym or real exercise yet, and every other day I seem to add some sort of crisps/cookies/extra thing into my diet. Today was really bad! I’ve gone over my normal calories by quite a bit. That’s okay, I’ll get back tomorrow I and keep going BUT I am wondering if the issue is that I keep these foods in my rotation. I’m having a difficult and stressful time right now, and think these foods may be detrimental to my efforts. I’m trying to be conscious of the long-term impact it may have.

Has anyone just straight up cut out these things? Like just processed and unhealthy snacks. And like where’s the line?? I had pancakes with fruit from a cafe a while back that was nice and fit into my diet BUT then I’ll have some crisps and cookies and I don’t feel great having them. Should I cut them out, and by what measure? Like when do I have something. Do I leave it till it’s a sit-down meal and been a while and play it by ear or do I just keep going with what I’m doing. I don’t want to JUST lose weight, but really do a body recomp where I can look good and attractive and really give it my best shot into feeling good and hitting exercise goals.

Any help is really appreciated! I’d like a good framework or model to follow maybe, something that’s practical and where I can rely on certain regulations on myself? Like I’m only allowed to eat baked goods someone else made or in a cafe once a month or something or crisps only at some function? I don’t really know. I’m confused. 🙏 ",3,1743007162.0,loseit,19,0.67,False

I grew up as a quiet, responsible kid and always did well in school. my family never had to check in on me because I was always the ""good"" one. but when I started college, things changed. I realized I wasn’t as smart or capable as I thought, and my grades and confidence dropped. I’ve struggled with self-esteem and body image issues since my teens, which made me avoid relationships and socializing. now, at 25, I regret not living those years more fully. my friends would say i’m a pretty social person without all these problems, but now i realize i always pretend in every situation. 

I’ve always kept a lot to myself, even with my closest friends and family. I don’t feel like anyone really knows me, and sometimes I feel like I’m pretending to be someone I’m not. I’m not as social as I seem on the surface. I’ve isolated myself in recent months and feel like I’ve lost all social connections. i’m so lonely right now that not even my closest friends and family knows about my problems. and i feel it will always be like this, i will never be able to tell or be truly myself with anyone.

after college, I moved to europe for my master’s. i supported myself with my savings for few months & was hoping to get a part time office job like I did in my bachelor’s. but I couldn’t find one, so I ended up waitressing. I’m not ashamed of my job, i always respected everyone’s jobs as long as they are making honest money. but I’ve hidden it from my family and close friends because I’m afraid of being judged. It’s hard to feel like I’m failing when everyone else seems to be succeeding in their careers.

once i was speaking with some friends this topic came around, and they told how desperate immigrants are to take these jobs they are overqualified for instead of just staying in their home country. i felt so uncomfortable, not because i’m ashamed of my job but because i don’t want to be perceived in any way by these people. maybe because i’m an insecure person. as i said not even my closest friends don’t know about this, so i kind of live a double life. i told some classmates (locals) i met abroad in master’s class about my part time job, they didn’t say anything but i kind of felt judged. because all of them are working in companies while doing their masters while i’m just serving coffees. 

I’ve met some wonderful people working in service, but the societal pressure and feeling like a failure in my family’s and friends’ eyes weigh on me. It’s hard to keep up appearances when I feel like I’m not doing what I “should” be doing. what would my family, friend or even old bosses back in my bachelor internship days would think about my situation now? 

now, with my studies almost over, I need to find a job in my field to stay in Europe. but I feel like I’m not good enough, and the job market here is incredibly competitive. the thought of going back to my home country feels like a failure, as economically and socially, it’s not the best place to build a life.
I feel like I have no ambition, no skills, and no future. I keep comparing myself to others and think I’ve accomplished nothing by this age. most of my peers have secure jobs and partners, some even kids & house already. I’m anxious about what’s coming next and feel hopeless most days.

I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for years now, but I can’t afford therapy, so I’ve been bottling everything up. some days, I can barely get out of bed or handle the simplest tasks. sometimes i avoid texts and emails because they give me anxiety. I feel lazy and irresponsible, and I beat myself up for it. The isolation has been getting worse, and I don’t know how to change it. i’m facing difficulties both mentally and financially and i ghosted everyone to deal with them alone, like i always do. 

I’ve always dreamed of finding someone to love and who would love me in return, but now I can’t imagine anyone ever loving me because I don’t even love myself. i like nothing about myself, not my personality, not my looks or anything. the idea of someone loving me in this form feels impossible. and at times, I question if it’s worth it anymore. sometimes i do not even see point for living anymore. i have no hopes or passion for anything. 

although i do feel suicidal sometimes the idea of offing myself is far away. i think about my family and friends, how shocked they would be if that happened. because they think nothing is wrong. i think about how devastated they would be and i don’t want them to feel that way. so instead sometimes i fantasize if an accident or something would just take me away so i wouldn’t do it myself. not a painful one though, i just want to be in peace.

I just feel so lost and tired of trying to survive each day. at 25, I feel like I’m way behind everyone else, and I don’t know what to do from now on. i feel like i have exhausted all my hopes and don’t have any left anymore. if you read this post until here, thank you! i just wanted to get everything off my chest because as i said not a single person in my life knows all this.  

and if you have a urge to comment, please be nice i’m already not in healthy mind state. for some i may sound like a ungrateful brat, i know many people would do anything to have opportunities like me to get education or be a physically healthy individual, for that i’m always grateful. as i said i feel so lonely, hopeless about life and disconnected from everything. i feel guilty for feeling this way and angry at myself for not trying hard in this life.

# Best Stores for Shopping Cart Racing

* **Costco** – These carts are big, sturdy, and built for epic sprints. Plus, they’ve got that heavy-duty vibe. You could probably race down a hill and still have room to toss in a few 40-pound packs of toilet paper.
* **Walmart** – Walmart carts are known for their questionable steering. This could work to your advantage in a race. Why? The wobbly, unpredictable motion makes for an extremely thrilling ride, and you can bet you’ll have people *definitely* staring as you race through the aisles like a lunatic.
* **Target** – Known for sleek design and ease of handling, Target carts will make you feel like you’re in a professional cart-racing league. The perfect balance of stability and speed, these babies are built for *style*.
* **Whole Foods** – If you want to race in a *high-end* cart, Whole Foods is the way to go. These carts are smooth, quiet, and glide like a dream. However, they're also full of Whole Foods customers who will be judging you harshly, so prepare for some side-eyes as you do 360s in the parking lot.

# Begging 101: How to Level Up Your Skills:

* **Step 1: Perfect Your Begging Face** You know that sad, lost look? The one that makes people want to throw change at you as if you're a *tragic hero* from a film? Practice in the mirror. Raise one eyebrow slightly, tilt your head a little to the side, and let that *soul-crushing sadness* pour through your eyes.
* **Step 2: “Begging Accents”** You’ve got to work on your “brand.” Are you the down-on-your-luck artist? The war veteran in need of change? The ever-hungry soul just looking for a bite? Find your persona and stick to it. A hobo with a story is a hobo who’s going to collect some serious cash.
* **Step 3: Scouting Locations** Find the high-traffic areas where kind-hearted strangers are most likely to part with their change: street corners, outside grocery stores, near ATM machines, or even those *fancy* coffee shops where people like to feel good about themselves for donating. **Pro Tip**: Make sure your “spot” is prime real estate: people watching, easy exit routes, and the potential for *sympathy*.
* **Step 4: Leverage Your “Props”** Need extra persuasion? Bring in props. That mangy dog you found (or your roommate’s cat in a cardboard box), a scruffy old jacket, a poorly drawn sign that says ""Hungry and Homeless"" with a smiley face. All these tools will help maximize your begging effectiveness.
* **Step 5: The Power of Positive Reinforcement** Always *thank* people for their generosity. Then *reassure* them: “You have no idea how much this means. You’re going to change my life… or at least get me a Big Mac.” People love to feel good about their small act of charity.

# How to Choose Your Rat for Fights:

* **The Bold**: Pick the ones who aren’t afraid to come up to you for food. These rats have confidence and will likely not back down in a fight.
* **The Hungry**: Rats that are particularly eager for food will have the stamina and drive to power through battles. They will fight for that prize—whether it’s a chunk of cheese or the ultimate victory.
* **The Resilient**: These are the rats who can withstand stress. Find the ones who can dodge obstacles and have quick reflexes. They’ll be the ones to survive in a brawl.

# Different Moves to Teach:

* **The Ambush**: Rats are natural stealth experts. Start training them by hiding food or treats in places that require them to sneak around to get to it. They’ll learn to stay low to the ground and move quietly.
* **Pro Tip**: Use small tunnels or makeshift barriers to teach them to surprise their opponent. The more they use their environment, the better their combat tactics will become.
* **Bite and Release**: The most basic attack in rat combat. When a rat gets close enough to its opponent, it needs to know how to launch a quick bite and then retreat. Think of it like a *hit-and-run* strategy.
* **How to Train**: Use a toy rat or a piece of string tied to a stick. Gently hold the string or the toy and allow your rat to nip at it. Reward them when they execute the “bite and release” correctly.
* **The Rat Charge**: Teach your rats to charge into battle when necessary. This is the *Gladiator* moment—the part where your rat throws caution to the wind and rushes in. Practice this by holding a treat on the other side of the arena and watching them race toward it like there’s no tomorrow.
* **Pro Tip**: Encourage them with loud battle cries (“FOR THE CHEESE!”) as they charge. The enthusiasm will amp them up.
* **The Dodge**: Rats are fast and agile. Teaching them to dodge attacks is crucial. Create “attacks” with a stick or your hand, and reward the rat when it successfully dodges your motions.
* **Pro Tip**: Go for rapid movements to make sure they’re quick on their feet. If they can dodge you, they can dodge other rats in the arena.

1jkg3wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1jkg3wa/master_list_of_top_recommended_appetite/,Master List of Top Recommended appetite suppressant & hunger control teas,"Alright, y’all,, if you’re out here battling those random snack attacks or just trying to get through the day without raiding the fridge, hunger control teas might be your new BFF.

I’ve rounded up some of the best appetite-suppressing teas that actually work (and taste good too). So if you’re trying to cut back or just want something to keep the cravings in check, this list has got you.

## Green Tea

If you're looking for a **classic, effective appetite suppressant**, green tea might be your go-to.

- It’s packed with **caffeine to reduce hunger** and **antioxidants for overall health benefits**. It often works better than coffee for suppressing appetite without that jittery crash.
- Variants like **jasmine green tea or green mint tea** add a flavorful twist. For those seeking something unique, try **Dragonwell (nutty flavor)** or **Matcha (grassy flavor)**, both excellent options with distinct tastes.

**1\. Best green tea brand for all-day appetite control & weight loss – my #1 pick (4.8/5)**

[**This brand**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) is currently my #1 pick for green tea + oolong tea combo. What sets this apart in my experience is its comprehensive approach to hunger management throughout the entire day. The Morning Energy blend features a potent combination of green tea (which numerous Reddit users consistently praise for natural appetite suppression) alongside metabolism-boosting oolong tea, orange peel, Lemongrass, Ginger, Dandelion etc..

Green tea is the star ingredient here, offering that perfect balance of gentle caffeine and L-theanine that I've found keeps hunger at bay without making me jittery like coffee does.

The addition of ginger and garcinia cambogia complements the green tea's appetite-suppressing properties, while dandelion leaf provides a mild diuretic effect that helps reduce bloating.

What really impressed me was how the Evening Detox formula takes over when the morning blend wears off, using fennel, cinnamon, and peppermint to continue controlling hunger through the dangerous evening snacking hours.

Unlike other appetite suppressant teas I've tried that rely solely on caffeine or harsh laxatives, this two-phase system works with your body's natural rhythms to provide consistent hunger control without the uncomfortable side effects that many reviewers report from ""skinny teas"" or ""detox"" products..

**Pros:**

- Two-phase system targets hunger throughout entire day and evening
- Green tea + oolong combination provides effective appetite suppression
- Pleasant taste from natural mint and monk fruit (no sweeteners needed)
- Addresses both daytime cravings and nighttime snacking urges
- Contains multiple natural appetite suppressants (green tea, ginseng, garcinia)

**Cons:**

- More expensive than single-formula teas
- Requires brewing two different teas daily
- Morning blend contains caffeine (not ideal for sensitive individuals)
- Some users report mild digestive adjustment period

**2\. Tea Burn - Best Powder Supplement for Boosting Your Tea's Appetite Control (4.6/5)**

Unlike traditional tea bags, [**Tea Burn**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/teaburn.php) has a different approach to appetite management with its unique powder format designed to enhance any tea you're already drinking.

The standout ingredients are Chlorogenic Acid derived from yerba mate and Camellia Sinensis (the same plant that gives us green tea), which work synergistically to elevate your ordinary tea into a powerful hunger-controlling beverage.

I've found that adding this to my morning cup significantly extends the appetite-suppressing effects that many of us report from plain green tea alone. What impressed me most was how the L-Theanine and L-Carnitine components specifically target hunger reduction while supporting metabolism, making this particularly effective during those mid-afternoon slumps when cravings typically hit hardest.

The chromium inclusion is especially beneficial for maintaining stable blood sugar levels, which several tea drinkers in forums note is crucial for avoiding the hunger spikes that lead to impulsive snacking.

While it lacks the pleasant taste profile of whole-leaf teas, the convenience of being able to transform any beverage into an appetite suppressant makes Tea Burn an exceptional option for those who enjoy variety in their daily tea routine but still want consistent hunger control benefits.

### Pros

- Versatile powder format enhances any tea or beverage
- Combines multiple appetite-suppressing compounds in one supplement
- Chromium helps stabilize blood sugar to prevent hunger spikes
- Convenient for travel and on-the-go use
- Contains L-Theanine specifically for hunger reduction

### Cons

- More expensive than traditional tea options
- Slightly medicinal taste can alter your favorite tea's flavor
- Requires consistent daily use for best results
- Less satisfying ritual than brewing whole tea leaves

**3\. The Republic of Tea Jasmine Pearls**

[This is a bougie **green tea**](https://amzn.to/4kWjao4) **experience with hand-rolled leaves** that bloom in your cup, releasing a heavenly **jasmine aroma**. It’s all about that slow, mindful steep—perfect for anyone who wants a tea ritual that feels as luxurious as it tastes. Their dedication to premium quality and sustainability, plus the tea's delicate floral notes will have you hooked after one sip!

**4\. DAVIDsTEA Buddha's Blend**

It is a one-of-a-kind **fusion of white and green tea**, elevated with jasmine pearls and the fruity aroma of white hibiscus blossoms—making it a total zen-in-a-cup vibe. This blend is perfect for anyone who loves a delicate, floral-fruity tea with medium caffeine kick for appetite suppression in between meal times, ideal for meditation sessions or just unwinding. What sets it apart? Its ethical sourcing and vegan-friendly ingredients, plus it’s smooth enough to sip all day without overpowering your taste buds!

**5\. Vital Tea's Moroccan Mint Blend**

This is the ultimate go-to for a refreshing and vibrant **minty kick paired with smooth green tea.** The unique combo of green tea and peppermint creates a cooling sip that’s perfect for unwinding or pairing with meals. It has an authentic flavor profile. They've captured the essence of Moroccan tea culture in a simple, affordable package!

## Peppermint Tea

Craving something refreshing? **Peppermint tea is your digestive superhero**.

- It helps calm your stomach and also **curb hunger pangs effectively**.
- To make it even more satisfying; some swear by adding a bit of **chocolate flavoring** for a treat-like experience. It’s perfect for staying on track while indulging your senses!

**1.All day hunger control**

In my experience with appetite-suppressing teas, [**this tea stands out & is my no.1 pick**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) for its clever incorporation of peppermint leaves in the Evening Detox formula, which provides that same satisfying mint effect many users praise plain peppermint tea for, but with added benefits.

The brilliance is in how they've enhanced peppermint's natural appetite-suppressing properties by pairing it with complementary ingredients like fennel fruit and cinnamon bark that work synergistically to control nighttime cravings - precisely when most diets fail.

**2\. Clipper Organic Peppermint Tea**

It offers a [**clean and refreshing peppermint tea**](https://amzn.to/3XVMwJj). Made with **100% organically grown peppermint**, it delivers a pure, crisp flavor that’s soothing and perfect for digestion. Plus, it comes in **unbleached and eco-friendly tea bags**, so you can sip guilt-free while helping the planet.

Clipper Organic Peppermint Tea offers a refreshing, clean taste with a cool, crisp finish that’s perfect for any time of day. It’s also an eco-friendly choice for peppermint tea lovers. This Fairtrade-certified tea is naturally caffeine-free and crafted with pure, organic peppermint for a vibrant and guilt-free cuppa.

**3\. Vital Tea's Moroccan Mint Blend**

If you’re looking for a **blend of green tea and peppermint,** this tea offers a cooling, authentic Moroccan flavor—to soothe your senses. It can be paired with meals too. Its flavour is unique.

**4\. Pampa Direct Yerba Mate Hierbas Silvestres**

Pampa Direct’s **Yerba Mate Hierbas Silvestres** offers a certified organic **blend of yerba mate with chamomile, mint**, and boldo for a refreshingly smooth and herbal flavor. The traditional firewood drying process gives it an authentic earthy taste without the bitterness or smoky notes common in some yerba mate blends. This blend is perfect for those looking to enjoy a calming yet invigorating cup with the added benefits of soothing herbs

## C.Yerba Mate Tea

Need energy without the caffeine jitters? **Mate tea is a lifesaver**, delivering a steady boost while **helping to suppress hunger**. Sweeten it with a **natural, zero-calorie sweetener like stevia** to keep cravings at bay—just 1/4 teaspoon can sweeten a quart. It’s ideal for those long workdays when hunger strikes, but energy is what you truly need.

**1.TeaBurn**

Among all the yerba mate products tested for appetite control, [**Tea Burn**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/teaburn.php) earns my top recommendation for its concentrated delivery of chlorogenic acid derived from premium yerba mate, precisely formulated to stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent hunger spikes throughout the day.

My 9 months old boy has never been a good sleeper. We transitioned him from bassinet to crib at 5 months old and it has been torture for me. He is Exclusively bf and wakes up every two hours to nurse. I usually nurse to sleep but I have to wait at least 17 min after he falls asleep for him to stay in the crib(sometimes this doesn't work). When it's bed time I have to hold him for an hour for him to stay. I am exhausted and very concerned for his safety because lately have been falling asleep on the rocking chair while holding him. So, I am seriously considering a floor bed in hopes that I can just nurse him to sleep and sneak out. Has this worked for anyone? 
Also, at night when he wakes up he pulls up to stand on the crib facing his bedroom door and I am concerned he tries to do this with the floor bed and falls.
Please advise, I have not slept in a while living of of coffee and it's affecting me deeply. Sorry for the rant.TA

1jkg1jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1jkg1jl/what_do_you_think_about_zenmas_frozen_espresso/,What do you think about Zenma’s frozen espresso shot idea? Am I missing something?,"Hey folks,

So I recently came across this company called Zenma, which is selling frozen espresso shots and as someone who genuinely enjoys coffee, I’m struggling to understand who this product is really for.

From what I read, the founders are passionate about coffee, even holding specialisations in coffee-making, which makes it even more confusing to me how they missed the basic consumer experience of espresso.

If I’m someone who loves going to cafés and has even a basic understanding of coffee, why would I want a frozen espresso shot that lacks both freshness and crema? Isn’t that kind of the whole point of an espresso?

And if I really want that café-style experience at home, I’d just get a manual coffee brewer. You can grab one for under ₹2,000 and use any specialty coffee to brew a fresh shot on the spot with crema and all.

Now if Zenma isn’t targeting coffee enthusiasts, then maybe they’re going after casual café-goers? But even that seems off. Many of my friends enjoy café visits order their americanos or cappuccinos, hang out for an hour or two but they don’t crave coffee later or feel the need to store shots at home.

Even if we look at it by income group:

* Upper middle class likely already owns machines or buys premium instant coffee.
* Middle class (in India, at least) often confuses espresso with ""black coffee"" and only knows cappuccino as ""coffee with milk.""
* Lower middle class prefers instant coffee altogether.

So, who is this really for?  
Is it for people who lack any real understanding of coffee but are okay paying a premium for something marketed as espresso?

Not trying to offend anyone or dismiss the brand this isn’t personal. But even as someone with an espresso machine at home, I’ve never thought of freezing my shots, and if I’m in a hurry, I’d honestly just grab some Davidoff instant and move on.

Maybe I’m overthinking it based on my own lens and I’m open to hearing other views.  
Would love to know what others here think does this make sense to you, or do you see a market for it that I’m missing?

Entrees were bad, appetizers were good. Maybe it's just a drink and appetizer place? 

Appetizers:  
Lamb in buffalo sauce - perfectly cooked, but doused in too much buffalo sauce. I asked for it on the side and they forgot.  
Wedge Salad - fantastic, perfect wedge, nice balsamic with a great blue cheese, but completely burnt, old bacon - maybe leftover from lunch service?  
Fried mushrooms with chipotle sauce - Great. Fried at the right temp to get them crispy and not soggy, sauce was good.   
Table bread - super fresh, great, served with a proper whipped butter. 

Entrees:   
10oz filet mignon ordered medium rare - burnt on the outside, completely raw on the inside. Middle entire third of the steak was uncooked and cold. I showed the waiter and he said, 'Yeah, that's just how we do it here, it's a little raw for some people.' Sent it back.   
Rib Eye: also ordered medium rare, came out medium well but was tender.  
Lobster tail - cooked unevenly, one side was cooked perfectly, other was cooked to death.   
  
Sides:  
Asparagus - raw on one side, burnt on the other, looked old  
Fried Dijon Brussel sprouts - perfect. Right balance of dijon and sweetness.  
Flight of steak sauces - Avoid. all were horrible. Bearnaise was broken, most were just butter. Chimichurri tasted like nothing. Gorgonzola butter just tasted like butter. 

Desserts:  
Strawberry cake - this is an excellent cinnamon vanilla coffee cake cut in half with strawberry frosting in the middle. Without the frosting it'd have been amazing. With? Ruins it.  
Creme brule - solid. Get this.

Drinks: Ordered a Negroni, got a Mezcal Negroni. Didn't complain, since that was listed on their menu. It was fine.

I've been in Texas 22 years and only had one good steak, and it was from Perry's in the domain. Ruth Chris was bad, Hoffbrau was cooked perfectly, but with so much butter I couldn't eat it.

I've lived a long life at my ripe old age of 32 and want to get this story out there to get a few things off my chest. But I will only do that if the moderators and the readers allow me to. I will keep it as pg as the story allows and replace certain letters with characters when needed.
I grew up in an abusive home, mother and father beat me on a regular basis and if I messed up anything would take my bed away and make me sleep on a fold out beach chair, the ones with like the weird laced rubber tubing, anyway, they also beat each other and my sister, I was the only kid in the neighborhood so I couldn't play with anyone. I did well in school and was even in quite a few sports, I stayed in shape and due to the physical abuse, got pretty good at fighting. At 10 my parents divorced and my mother told me on my birthday, I was to live with her, we moved to cheap section 8 housing and that's when my life really started to take a downward spiral. She started dating all kinds of people and it started out with them just treating me like garbage, but it escalated overtime, turning into SA, then down right R. The issue was is she was present for most of this and would threaten me with a knife or bat if I talked to anyone, I did tell my dad but to him it just ended up being a ""cry for help"" because I had voiced my concerns for living with her. So I became the weird kid, I was reclusive, distant, a loner. But if you had crossed me, you would know it. I had a rage in me that could never be satisfied, my mother ran through men like they were a secret menu of a coffee shop, I ended up getting into some pretty serious fights in the apartment complex we lived in and it forced us to have to move. She had found a cheap house in the same town and we moved, she then had met Mike, I liked Mike, he didn't treat me like crap and he had kids! A son (Devon) and a daughter (Allison), Devon wanted to be the ""bully"" step bro, but that didn't last to long. But Allison was different, she was tough and abrasive but her and I got along. We became fast friends and she ended up introducing me to her friend group! I had hit it off with them fast! We all had rough home lives and fit that ""goth, scene, punk"" crowd. Out of all of our (now combined) friends, Mykayla or Miki for short, was my best friend, we connected in a way I've never been connected to someone before, or since. I fell in love with her and I haven't ever stopped. 

I will fast forward to todays problem, if you would like to know the in between please let me know!

I was in the military after high school and had seen combat, I had sought what little help the military offered and it had made their decision for them to medboard me easy, I became homeless due to not having anything set up for myself, I drove my truck from Georgia back home and lived in it for about a year, I met my current wife through a mutual friend I had stayed in mild contact with since high school and we hit it off alright, for a homeless guy lol, we dated and I met her parents the whole 9, fast forward again to about 3 years ago, we had a falling out with her parents and in that I learned exactly what I was to them, I was a trophy, ""homeless vet"" that they took care of, helped get back on his feet, I paid rent to stay in their drive way, I paid my way, they just gave me a place I wouldn't get towed from. My wife has inherited a few of the bad habits from her parents, either learned or otherwise, but she has been very narcissistic and emotionally unavailable to me for years now. I have started seeing therapists and started a self healing journey to try and rebuild my relationship with her but I have come to the realization that I do not want to anymore...

1jkfvlu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jkfvlu,Elevate 1000pc Jigsaw Puzzle: Mandala Rocks - Hinkler," I finally completed my first jigsaw puzzle and not just any puzzle, but a challenging 1,000-piece one!

I picked this up on a whim at a local shop over two years ago, not really knowing what a 1,000-piece puzzle would be like. I was drawn to the image and decided to give it a shot. I started in early March, and it took me about 3 to 4 weeks to finish. My mum joined in, and eventually, she got so into it that she started working on it herself! At times, I would take pieces into my room to work on separately.

The process was a rollercoaster—poor lighting made it tricky, and frustration sometimes led to arguments with my mum. It was truly bittersweet—enjoyable yet frustrating, fun yet tense. While I loved working together, there were moments when it became overwhelming. Doing it on a coffee table made things even harder since we had to sit on the floor or a footstool. I even resorted pieces about 5 to 8 times!

The puzzle itself wasn’t the best quality, some pieces bent easily, and the image was blurry, but for £8-10, I can’t complain too much. Definitely not the easiest choice for a first puzzle! At least there wasn't any missing pieces. Hooray.

Thanks to this community and my newfound appreciation for adult jigsaw puzzles, I’m thinking about making this a regular hobby, Let’s see where this journey takes me!

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/B2GtJEP0Vz
 
Lost access to my previous account, so posting it from here 

I didn’t expect my post to gain the kind of traction it did. I genuinely appreciate the advice many of you offered. Some responses were a bit… nuclear (understandably, Reddit), but I did take in a lot of perspectives that helped me reflect.

I want to share some context that I didn’t include in the original post, which I now realize was important. A few years ago, I went through a rough depressive episode. My husband and I were doing long-distance at the time—he was working abroad—and while he supported me as best he could, it was hard. His mom was the one who showed up in person. She dropped by often, made sure I was eating, even came with me to therapy a couple of times. It wasn’t some grand gesture, but it mattered. That kind of consistency stays with you.

So when she reached out a few days ago, anxious and saying she didn’t know who else to ask, I just reacted. I helped her with a bit of money—from my personal account, nothing major—and I agreed to meet her for coffee. I didn’t tell my husband before doing it, and that was where things really unraveled.

He was blindsided. We’ve always been the kind of couple who talks through the hard stuff, and I acted completely on my own. I see now how that felt like betrayal to him.

After a bit of space and some heavy conversations, we talked properly. He told me he’d spoken to his younger brother and finally got the full story about their last attempt to reach out to their mom. It wasn’t just an argument—it was bad. She said things that were apparently cruel and deeply personal, the kind of stuff that cuts years deep. I hadn’t known any of that. Neither of us had.

Hearing it changed something for me. The woman I saw at coffee was warm, vulnerable, even a little lost. But that’s not the woman his brother dealt with. And maybe both are real. Maybe she’s unraveling. Maybe she’s always been complicated. I honestly don’t know.

What I do know is that my husband’s boundaries are valid. He told me clearly that he’s not ready to reconnect with her, and that he’s not comfortable with me being in touch with her either. And after hearing what I’ve heard, I understand that. I’ve told him I’m stepping back. If she does reach out again, I’ll tell her that I can’t be the person in the middle—not unless something genuinely shifts between them first.

We both apologized. He for shutting down so quickly, me for making a decision without him when I shouldn’t have. We’re okay now.

I still think there’s something more going on with her—emotionally, maybe even mentally. She’s been a stay-at-home mom most of her life, her siblings live abroad, and from what I’ve heard, she’s already asked her friends for help before coming to me. That doesn’t excuse anything, but it does make me think about how lost she might be right now.

Still, that’s not something I can fix. Right now, my focus is on us. I can care about what his mom did for me in the past and still recognize that she’s hurt people I love.

This whole situation has been messy and a bit surreal. We didn’t walk away from it with everything fixed, but we’ve come out of it with a better understanding of where we each stand. We handled it the best we could, and at the end of the day, we’re still solid.

Still, I can’t lie—there’s a part of me that feels pulled toward who she was for me during that rough time. Letting go emotionally feels messier than I expected. How do you emotionally let go of someone who was once there for you, when the situation clearly calls for distance?

1jkfs6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1jkfs6p/any_tips_on_how_i_can_improve_my_sleep/,Any tips on how I can improve my sleep?,"I hardly ever get good sleep. I train middle distance triathlon and recovery is very important to my training, however sleep is a real let down for me. 

I use a garmin forerunner to track my activities, including sleep. I know activity trackers may not be the most specific, however I do feel my watch does give me a relatively accurate report of my sleep. I have no problem falling asleep, however it’s waking up during the night numerous times and tossing and turning to try get back to sleep is the problem. I am pretty sure I may have insomnia to some degree.

My sleep schedule does have vary daily due to working hours. Sometimes going from a late, into and early work shift, which only allows about 6 hours sleep, however sometimes I get better sleep scores on a 6 hour sleep than a longer uninterrupted sleep.

I would consider my anxiety and stress levels relatively normal. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke, and I don’t drink coffee or caffeine drinks. I have toyed with the idea of maybe trying prescribed sleeping medication, however I want that to be last resort.

Any tips or advice on how I may improve on my sleep?",1,1743006171.0,sleep,4,1.0,False

My budget is $1300 - 1800 per person. Move in by end of April - beginning of May ideally but flexible on this.

I work hybrid, usually in the office 2-3 days a week. I generally clean as I go, usually don't leave dishes in the sink or clothes laying around etc., and if so they don't stick around for too long. I don't have pets.

I like cooking, I read a lot, been getting into DJing more recently. I go to the gym regularly, I love my bicycle and also just got a motorcycle. My way of destressing is going out dancing in the weekends maybe every other week.

Looking for someone 25-35, male preferred, LGBT friendly. Ideally you also have a weekday working schedule and want the peace and quiet that it requires during the weekdays, but you also want socialization/the occasional party during the weekends.

My priority right now is finding someone that I would enjoy living with, finding an apartment will be the easy part. DM me if any of this is striking a chord with you, would love to get coffee and see if we're a good match.",2,1743006162.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False

1jkfpok,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOT/comments/1jkfpok/trying_to_make_a_lora_messaging_pen/,Trying To Make A LoRa Messaging Pen,"Hey, guys! John here. I really like to click the button on my spring pen. Imagine how cool it would be if one were actually able to slide in a little chip and a small battery and connect to WiFi, maybe long pressing the pen's button (or atleast, what I like to call it) for some 20 seconds to toggle the WiFi connectivity. Now here is where I have some problems:  
1. I do not want to buy another sim card just for internet connectivity on this pen which I will probably program to spam A's in my best friends chat when I'm bored at college (because it is more fun and lengthier than using my phone).

2. I have no idea how I can detect the button being pressed down and possibly its two states of press. 

So, I came across this term called LoRaWAN which is basically when you use a little bit of hardware to ""share"" your wifi far away. So what I have fantasized in my head is,

I can use a minimalistic microcontroller to connect to the LoRa hardware and to the sensor for the button.

I can then have the same bit of LoRa hardware at my house 2 kilometers away, from where I am able to ""share"" my network, and actually use it from my microcontroller all the way at some coffee shop.

The only problem is, I have absolutely no idea on how to do it! Neither do I know if my approach is right. I have done some research and come across the [RAK3172-SiP STM32WL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI6YgQmISjM).

Could you experts out there guide me on how to do this, and what would be my ideal cost-effective components for fitting inside the pen (and not having it slide all the way to the nib) and detecting this ""press"" especially. I have no idea on how to connect to WiFi.

I have read some documentations on some microcontrollers that are ""the size of black peppers"" and have 6 I/O ports, but I do not know which microcontroller I should ACTUALLY be using.",1,1743006002.0,IOT,0,1.0,False

🕯️Tell us a bit about yourself:

Welll yk my name and shit like that. I’m currently a student about to graduate like rlllllly soon. I have my own small business. I’m hugeeee on growth, healing, and wellness yk so my business is like that. I absolutely loooove to help people. It’s just my passion and calling. My business is called The Healing Coven (THC😏) and it’s like a blend of witchcraft, mental health coaching, apothecary goods, and stonerrrr shit. I’m very creative and make some resin goods toooo. Honestly, my energy shifts a lot and some days I’m more of a hyper-productive tornado and others I just want to be left alone bc I need to recharge lol. So some days I may be texting u back after seconds whereas other days, I won’t answer bc it’s my self care, no screen day lol. I am very deep and I value honesty, loyalty, dark humor lol, and someone who actuallly cares. Checking in and making sure you’re good is my love language fr. I wanna make sure ur good ts. Anyways, I am a vibe lol. I have a ton of ideas, I like to do a lot, and rarely anything holds me back. I have IC and endo too btw. So I do have some hard times yk but it’s just a small little piece of the cake that makes me lol. Alsoooo I looooove iced coffee and cranberry juice. I love steak, pasta, pho, potstickers, ouuuu and weed. I love weed. Huge stoner right here. I also love some other stuff too. I like spiritual awakenings and trips so yk 😏. My favorite 2 animals are polar bears and crows. Fav colors are black most definitely, a beige type of brown so like sepia, and then a dark forest green and a sage green. I have like 42-43 tattoos and I do some tats myself. I also have 2 tongue piercings, a septum, and my ears have gauges. I used to pierce and tattoo. I still do but moving onto more yk. 



🕯️What do you enjoy doing in your free time?

I loveeee to cook, read, write, paint, draw, tattoo, organize shit, drive, listen to music or watch my comfort shows/movies. 



🕯️How would you describe your personality?

I am a very deep, introspective person. I have a fun and chaotic side but can also be nonchalant and calm ash. I can be very quiet or pretty crackhead depending on the scenario and day. I can be very blunt but also very caring. I am independent ash but love deep connections. And when I say deep, I mean D E E P. I feel like I’m the blond and brunette friend duo in one. I’m the sun and the moon together lol. Yin and yang ts. I love structure but also value flexibility. I am a big problem solver. I have a pretty sharp mind. Resilient. Creative asf. I’m always looking to improve myself and my life for the better. I ask way too many questions sometimes but I just always want to learn and know more. I don’t tolerate bs at all tbh. I am also reallyyyy smart. Alsoooo, I love being there for people and all. I love the deep connection but I also do need my own space yk. Sometimes I need to recharge or just be by myself for a lil. 



🕯️What’s a fun fact about you or something people might not know at first glance?

I’ve been hit by a car then he tried to kidnap me lol. 
Also I graduated high school at 16, am now graduating uni at 20 :) 



🕯️What are you looking for in a friend?

I want somebody with similar interests as me. Someone who is loyal, funny and down to talk about anything, someone who is empathetic and can feel for me like I can for them. I also want somebody who lifts me up, as I will them. I don’t like when females put other females down like cmon now. I wanna lift each other up. Raise one another’s vibrations. Maybe someone who is spiritual like I am? I want someone who wants the same kind of friendship as well. We don’t have to be connected at the hip lol but it would be nice to talk all the time and be there when one of us needs to vent or laugh or wtv. 



🕯️What’s your preferred way of communicating?

Texting is my favorite way of communicating. I am not one to call, I tend to get rlly busy sometimes but I would be willing to meet in person if possible too yk. 



🕯️How often do you like to hang out or stay in touch with friends?

I love deep frequent conversations. Let’s chat it up everyday. We don’t need to give each other 10 hours of our time a day just talking deep. I want it to be yk different. One day we talk deep, the next we talking goofy with each other. It doesn’t need to be that serious. I want a long term connection. A bestie. But it’s rlly not like we have to talk everyday just yk… want someone who is present. 



🕯️What’s most important to you in a friendship?

I would probably say support and trust. 



🕯️What do you value in conversations or interactions with friends?

Deep talks, jokes, being able to vent, and shared silence where there’s no expectations. 



🕯️Do you have any pet peeves or things that might turn you off in a friendship?

Being disrespectful or being lowkey disrespectful in jokes and shit. Lack of communication. Constant negativity. Talking down on everybodyyyy. Not being able to take a joke… 



🕯️How do you feel about traveling or meeting up in person?

I looooove traveling and would eventually be down yk. I do have social anxiety and it can be hard for me to meetup or do calls and things like that. Im working on it yk but be patient, we dont know what the future holds. I would eventually want to yk. 



🕯️Are you interested in exploring new activities with a friend?

Most definitely. I love learning new skills and just learning or growing in general. 




🕯️How would you handle conflict or disagreements in a friendship?

Honestly maybe take a second then come back later. Maybe just calm down the situation and then sit down and figure it out, as adults. No fighting or yelling. Tell me what’s going on and I’ll do the same. We will sit there and handle it till it’s resolved. If u can’t do that, then we can’t be friends. Being petty, rude, and disrespectful is not for me. Just bc we have an argument, doesn’t mean u throw respect out the window lol. Handle this shit w me like adults. 



🕯️What’s something you’re working on personally (growth, goals, etc.) that a friend might support you in?

Honestly my own growth and personal development. I have so many goals. I have some problems yk, health wise mainly and so my routine has been so out of wack. I am trying to get on track, make a plan and goals, then start on my journey of getting myself up and going yk. I wanna be healthier (in all aspects so spiritually, mentally, physically, etc) and reach my cool. If you could support me in that, I would always do the same and that would be awesome. 



🕯️Is there anything specific you’d like to share to help us understand you better?

I am a witch so I am very spiritual. I was born into it and grew up in it as well. My whole life my families were always split and half was Christian whereas the other half was catholic. My mom and immediate family were witches and so were some of my other ancestors. I have been around religion my whole life and have some minimal trauma yk. I have always been hated on for being a witch and into witchcraft. This is why I want a friend who is into the same things as I am. I don’t hate on religion at all, it’s just not my cup of tea. But when you come to me saying I’m going to hell, of course ima bash on u cause what?? No I do not worship the devil. No i do not sacrifice babies. No I am not evil. I have been bashed on for so much that’s not even true lol. I believe in the universe and spirit. I do not believe in god or the devil. I manifest, I don’t pray. I do spells and rituals but honestly a lot of them are to better myself and help me with my journey. I’m not sitting there casting love spells on your dad, chill! 



🕯️Why should someone want to be friends with you?

Honestly I am reallyyyy fucking dope man. I am loyal as fuck, funny ash, smart as shit, and just a good ass friend. If u need me im there. I mean if u call me I probably won’t answer but if u text me im right there for you dawg. I’m like a whole ass mental health coach like actuallyyy so I got you with whatever mannn. Need some advice? I’m a pro. Need a shoulder to cry on? I’m all in. Need to let some shit out ? Shit I gotchu man I’ll let some shit out with you. Just need anything in general? I am ready and already by yo side! Butttttt the second I see you’re not there for me in the same way?? I’m gone. I have always been the giver and never the receiver and I am no longer taking that yk. So cmon if u want that, at least be willing to give out too yk. 



🕯️Anything else you’d like to add?

Honestly not really. Just text me and get to know me. Don’t be dry or be basic ash. I hate that shit and it will die out quick trust. I’m too deep for shallow talks. Text me and tell me why your dad left your mom. Tell me why you’re missing a finger. I wanna know everything yk. Be unique, that’s what I’m looking for. Need my soul sister, my bestie boo yfm. 



P.S. a lot of shit that I say I’m just joking yk. I’m sarcastic as fuck. U might think I’m like a lover girl or some shit and whole time I’m just joshin. I am a lover girl but I’m not gonna sit here and be all cringe sorry. If u think I am, I’m most definitely laughing at myself. 

If you’re a Scorpio, that’s a plus and u should definitely text me like rnnnn. 

Also if u read alllll of this, props to u. 😏🥰🖤

Sorry if this isn't allowed, I'd just like some advice.
So, I started seeing this guy 3 months ago, dating for 2. Everything seems amazing, he's an amazing, hardworking guy and seems to have his shit together. His last relationship ended in the middle of 2023 when she (don't know her age) broke it off with him after he essentially gave up. Apparently, she was just awful to him. He didn't talk about her a lot, but any time I did something normal like pay for my own coffee or food, or buy my own groceries he acted like I was the best girl he ever met. 
I met his mom and she added me on Facebook. A couple weeks later, shit hits the fan. He tells me he got a phone call about needing to go to court on charges his ex brought forward. 2 years later. She got a NCO as well. I really don't believe he is capable of any of this, but it's so early, I don't want to say for sure. My mom and my friends think I should be weary as this all seems suspicious, and worry for me. I don't think I'd be able to be a victim, as I feel like I could spot easy signs. I went to school for counselling and feel like I am properly trained for this. We're in Canada so the legal system is kind of ass to begin with, and he's been honest with me for everything I've asked, like how she managed to get an NCO without any proof. I've deep dived her Facebook throughout their entire relationship from 2017-2023 and found nothing that set off any red flags about him lying or her being truthful. He's paying top dollar for a lawyer, as he's a POC and grew up in the system so the odds are stacked against him, if the case turns into a he said she said thing. I just don't know what to do or feel about this. My mom suggested taking a step back, but I really feel like he'll notice and I don't want to be unsupportive in this situation.
