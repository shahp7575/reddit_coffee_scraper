I thought of decently trying to talk to girls just a simple Hi asking them which team and basic things. I talked to a girl near coffee machine, she was smiling while talking and then went away after coffee was poured into cup from machine no cya nothing kinda abruptly. I'm wondering what even happened.

So if I see a random girl and maybe ask her to be friends what is the way, I mean how to ask someone to be friends? I never even had female friends so that's why I'm asking.",1,1758139861.0,AskIndianWoman,0,1.0,False
1njnvxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1njnvxn/its_been_a_while/,It’s Been a While,"Summer is ending, which always makes me think of you. I wonder how you’re doing. I heard you found a new girlfriend; I hope she’s perfect and gives you all of the things we both know I couldn’t.

It wouldn’t have worked between us, and I know that. I felt stifled. You didn’t want to compromise and I don’t blame you. But sometimes I wish you would have. I love you. I always will. And I miss that sense of safety, that deep understanding we had for each other, and I wish that our emotional connection could have been enough. The inside jokes and the easy routine we had. The late night talks and the mornings with coffee in matching mugs. Making dinner for us both at night. The pandemic when we both were stuck at home and never got sick of each other, not even once. The way we grew and changed as we made the effort to understand each other. All of that feels so far away now, like another lifetime completely, and I guess in a way it was another lifetime. I’ve changed so much, been forced to confront things I never would have if we’d remained in our little bubble. Have you changed too? I wonder.  

But I said I didn’t want to be “possessed” by anybody, and I wondered why you didn’t understand that, but in our time apart I came to understand your perspective. Still, like I said, we wouldn’t have lasted. One key thing missing, one thing nobody was willing to compromise on. One thing. Love goes so much deeper than that thing, but. I guess another life was calling my name. So. Off I went. 

I’m sorry for how overzealous I was for new horizons back then. I know I hurt you. The guilt from that continues to eat at me. But the pain has been suppressed since then. Has it been three years? Four? Have we now been apart for almost as long as we were together? Time is flying. 

I numbed my emotions around this for a while. First with alcohol, then with depression meds, but now I’m not on anything, and I’m finally hurting. But maybe not as much as you were hurting. It’s a good hurt, I guess. A complicated and futile hurt. I know our separation was necessary. 

Why couldn’t we find a way to stay together? Why did you want to own me so badly? Why couldn’t you have been born a girl? Why couldn’t we have a loving, emotionally fulfilling, understanding, peaceful relationship without the physical part? Do you cherish our memories the way I do? Do you listen to Never Meant every autumn and can’t help but tear up while you’re going for a walk or driving down the road? 

I guess this letter is just to say that I still think of you and I hope you’re doing well. I hope you found someone who ticks all the boxes. Our love was unconventional in the end, but I think it was more pure for that. I hope you have found all that and more, I know it’s what you wanted. 

I don’t think I’ll ever get into a relationship again. I’ve had more than my fair share. The memories I have with you are still my favorite. ",1,1758139856.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1njnu4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1njnu4m/the_iron_road_terror/,The Iron Road Terror,"Somewhere in the Utah Territory, 1868

The Utah Territory stretched vast and untamed, a country of red rock and dust, of jagged buttes that rose like broken teeth against a burning sky. In the mornings the light came hard and golden, scorching the mesas, and by night the desert turned cold and sharp as iron. Sagebrush and brittle grass clung to the soil in patches, stubborn survivors in a land that gave nothing for free.

It was a place that tested anyone who crossed it. Wagons splintered on hidden rocks, oxen collapsed from thirst, and men sometimes followed not long after. Heatstroke, starvation, sudden storms, flash floods, rattlesnakes coiled in the shade — all of it conspired to break the will of the traveler. Those who lived here knew better than most: this land was a master of patience, and it swallowed the careless whole.

And yet, for all its treachery, it was a land of majesty. The silence was deep, almost holy, broken only by the cry of a hawk wheeling above. The canyons sang when the wind cut through them. The horizons stretched endless, promising both danger and freedom in equal measure.

But even the wilderness was changing.

Deep in its heart, where no cattle trail or stagecoach dared to go, a scatter of white canvas tents dotted the landscape like pale blisters. They gathered along a raw black line carved across the earth — the wound of progress. This was the line of the Union Pacific, stretching its way westward.

Inside the tents slept the men tasked with the greatest work of their lives: laying iron across the spine of the continent. They were rough men — Irish, Chinese, freedmen, wanderers — driven by hunger, debt, or sheer stubborn pride. Their campfires marked the slow, relentless march of industry through the last wilderness.

The transcontinental railroad was more than rails and timber. It was promise. It would bind the Atlantic to the Pacific, link the teeming cities of the East with the gold and ports of the West. Goods, mail, and men would travel in days what once took months by wagon or ship. It meant unity after war, wealth after ruin, and a leash on a frontier long thought ungovernable.

Every mile driven forward tightened that leash. Every spike hammered rang with the death knell of the old Wild West.

The camp slept uneasily beneath a bruised sky. Dawn was little more than a pale smudge along the far horizon, the stars still stubbornly clinging overhead, the moon hanging thin and sharp. A soft breeze cut across the rows of canvas, tugging at guy ropes and making lanterns sway where they dangled from lines strung between rough-hewn posts. The tents shivered faintly with every gust, their fabric rippling in rhythm with the deep, guttural snores inside.

The fire pits had burned low through the night, their last embers glowing faintly orange beneath the ash. Smoke drifted up in lazy threads, carrying with it the scent of scorched coffee and pork fat left from the men’s supper.

At the center of camp, larger than the rest, sat the foreman’s tent. Inside, Tobias Boone slept stretched across his cot, his face drawn hard even in rest. Once a decorated general in the Union Army, Boone had worn command like a second skin — but since the war’s end, he had been a man adrift. The offer to lead this section of the Union Pacific had come at the right time. His old discipline, his iron steadiness, his sharp decision-making — all of it had made him the natural choice. If there was a man who could wrangle a camp of roughnecks, keep them driving rail through hell itself, it was Tobias Boone.

But Boone was not the one this story would follow.

No, the true witness slept at the foot of his cot, sprawled across the dirt floor with her legs splayed, her chest rising and falling in quick, even breaths. Every so often a soft yip or throaty growl slipped from her jaws as she dreamed — of hares darting across the sage, of birds taking wing just out of reach. Her nub of a tail thumped against the earth, a twitching rhythm of some imagined chase.

This was Spur.

Seven years old, hide toughened by sun and dust, her coat still carried the vibrant red of her breed. A patch of white around her muzzle betrayed the years creeping up on her, but her eyes still burned sharp, her spirit still quick. Her ears, folded down since birth in a soft defect, flicked at every sound around the camp. A canvas flap stirring, the shuffle of a restless boot, the whistle of the breeze as it cut between the tents — she heard it all.

Spur stirred, rising slowly onto stiff legs. She stretched long, forepaws planted forward as her back arched, then released a long, sighing yawn that showed her teeth. With a shake of her coat, dust puffed around her in the dim half-light. 

Spur padded across the tent, claws clicking faintly against the wood planks beneath the cot. She rose on her hind legs, forepaws planted on the side of the bed. Her nose twitched as she studied Boone, his chest rising and falling in the slow rhythm of deep sleep. She stared at him with patient expectancy, her ears tilting forward, tail nub quivering.

A soft whimper slipped from her throat. She sniffed his arm, then leaned up and dragged her tongue across his cheek, wet and insistent. Boone only grunted, rolling his head to the side as his snoring returned, stubborn and heavy.

Spur blinked once, then made her choice. With a firm nudge she drove her head into his ribs.

Boone lurched upright, eyes wide, his hand darting for the revolver on the crate by his cot — but stopped when he found only Spur staring back at him. Her gaze was blank, unbothered, as if to say: You’re late.

The old soldier huffed, rubbing his face with a calloused hand. A yawn split his jaw, but a smirk tugged at his mouth all the same. “Alright, girl. You win. Mornin’ to you.” He reached down and patted her head, fingers working gently between her ears.

Beside the cot sat a little ball, bound in leather and scuffed with years of play. Boone picked it up, holding it up to the dim light. Spur’s ears pricked instantly, her whole body sharpening to a point. Her eyes went wide, tail stump wagging with violent impatience.

Boone chuckled low in his throat, lifting his arm and feinting a throw. Spur flinched forward, muscles coiled, eyes locked to the ball’s imagined path. When no ball came, she snapped her gaze back to Boone, betrayed.

Then Boone gave a real toss. The ball sailed out through the tent’s open flap, and Spur shot after it like an arrow loosed from a bow.

With a grunt, Boone swung his legs off the cot and pulled himself upright, joints popping as he stood. He staggered to the corner of the tent where an iron contraption stood — a tall pipe rigged through the canvas, rope and lever hanging down. Wrapping his hand around the cord, he gave a firm yank.

Outside, Spur had already pounced on the ball, shaking it violently between her teeth as though killing a rabbit. But her ears twitched at once, head snapping back toward the tent.

The sharp blast of a whistle cut across camp, slicing the quiet morning in two.

All around, the tents came alive with groans and curses as the men stirred, dragging themselves into another long day.

The noise of the camp swelled with each passing minute. Canvas flaps slapped open, boots scraped across dirt, and voices rose in a chorus of yawns, curses, and banter. Men called to one another as they stretched and stumbled out, some already shouldering tools, others dragging themselves awake with all the speed of molasses.

At the mouth of Boone’s tent, Spur lay gnawing happily at her ball, her jaws working it over until it glistened with slobber. She only looked up when Boone stepped out, uniform coat buttoned, boots laced, his hat shadowing the tired lines of his face.

Spur’s eyes followed him, head tilted, ball still wedged in her teeth. Boone let out a low chuckle and shook his head.
“You ready for breakfast?” he asked softly, voice rough with sleep. He clapped his hands together once. “Come on, girl.”

The ball dropped to the dirt with a wet plop as Spur scrambled to her feet, ears perked, tail nub wagging furiously. She bounded after him, leaving the toy forgotten behind her.

The two of them moved toward the camp’s heart, where a wide, canvas-roofed mess tent stood pitched. Smoke drifted from cookfires behind it, the air thick with the mingled scents of salt pork, beans, scorched coffee, and dried biscuit. Already a line of workers had formed, men shuffling forward with tin plates in hand as they received their morning portions.

Boone fell in with the rest, Spur pressed close to his leg. A few of the men spotted her and bent down, rough hands scratching behind her ears or patting her broad back as she passed. Spur leaned into the attention, tail beating in short, frantic thumps, her mouth opening in a panting grin as she loosed a few happy, grumbling sounds deep in her chest.

“Morning, Spur,” one of the Irishmen said, flicking a crumb of biscuit down to her. She snatched it up, licking the dirt from her muzzle with no shame.

By the time Boone reached the front, his tin plate was slapped full with the standard fare — beans thick with pork fat, a strip of salt bacon, a square of cornbread hard enough to outlast a storm, and a tin cup of black coffee that smelled like burnt tar.

Spur’s eyes, however, weren’t on the plate. They lifted higher as a head appeared above the counter, peering down at her.

It belonged to a dark-skinned woman, her hair pulled back and threaded with gray, spectacles perched low on her nose. She looked to be somewhere in her sixties, her hands worn and strong from decades of work. A slow smile spread across her face when she spotted the heeler waiting below.

“Well now,” she said warmly, voice rasped with age. “If it isn’t the little bear come to stuff herself up.”

Spur’s ears folded, her rump plopping to the ground as her tail stump wiggled with delight. She panted happily, tongue lolling, gazing up with wide, expectant eyes.

To some in the camp she was Spur, to others simply Little Bear. Her folded ears gave her a round, ears that were cub-like in appearance, her thickset frame adding to the impression. And while she was gentle enough with the men, they knew she could turn fierce if pressed. A bear in spirit as much as in shape.

The woman bent down and slipped a small sack across the counter toward Boone. “I scrounged up some things special for you,” she said with a wink.

Boone accepted it with a nod, his mouth quirking faintly. “Much obliged.” He balanced his plate in one hand, the sack in the other, and began to turn away when her voice called him back.

“Tobias—” She leaned in a little, her expression tightening behind the spectacles. “We’re runnin’ a touch low on meat for this evening. Salt pork won’t stretch far with all these mouths.”

Boone paused, then gave a thoughtful grunt. “I’ll send Isaiah out later. He and Spur’ll scare up something out by the canyon.” He tipped his hat; the matter settled in his tone.

She nodded, though worry lingered on her face as she turned back to the next man in line.

Boone and Spur found themselves a patch of dirt near the fire pit where the smoke curled low and lazily. Boone crouched down, setting the small sack in front of Spur. Her ears pricked instantly, tail stump twitching with violent impatience.

He raised a finger. “Wait.”

Spur froze in place, haunches pressed to the ground, but her eyes flicked rapidly between Boone and the sack, her tongue running along her lips as she whimpered softly.

Slowly Boone loosened the knot and peeled back the cloth. Inside lay the “treasures” she had put aside — strips of burnt bacon, a handful of dried blueberries, and a few chunks of raw potato. Hardly a feast for a man, but for Spur it might as well have been heaven.

“Wait,” Boone repeated, voice firm but calm, as he set the sack open in front of her. Only then did he lower himself, settling his plate across his knees. He spooned up a mouthful of beans, sopping them with cornbread.

When he was ready, he finally muttered, “Alright.”

Spur launched forward, muzzle burying into the sack. She crunched bacon with loud satisfaction, blueberries staining her teeth, potato chunks snapped down between eager jaws. Boone chuckled under his breath, shaking his head at her complete lack of grace.

“You’re a damn sight happier with your breakfast than I am with mine,” he said, jabbing a fork into his beans as she devoured hers with reckless joy.

For a moment, the two of them ate together, side by side in the growing light of dawn, the camp around them alive with voices and clatter. As Boone and Spur ate, the morning crowd at the cook tents thinned. First the foremen left, plates scraped clean, then the crews drifted off in twos and threes, their laughter and curses trailing behind. Soon the benches were empty save for a few stragglers choking down cold beans. Boone wiped his hands on his trouser leg, set aside his plate, and stood. Spur licked the last grease from her muzzle and trotted after him without hesitation.

They crossed out of camp and onto the line — the great black scar that ran across the red earth. The iron road, still young, not yet christened by the thunder of locomotives, stretched away until it vanished into the pale horizon.

Here the air thrummed with sound.

Men moved in rhythm along the track, their shirts already dark with sweat. The heavy fall of hammers struck down iron spikes in unison, the clang ringing sharp against the canyon walls. Monkey wrenches groaned as rails were twisted into place. The snap of cutters shearing bolts cracked like musket fire. All together it was a strange sort of music: a melody made of iron and toil, of aching hands and steady arms.

Between the strikes and groans, voices rose in song. Shanties carried by a dozen throats rolled across the plains, songs of backbreaking work and endless days, songs to bind tired men together in a rhythm that matched the swing of their tools. Some sang loud, defiant against the labor, while others hummed low, the words lost but the cadence steady as the road itself.

Boone walked slow along the rail, hands hooked in his belt, head tilting slightly as he whistled the tune under his breath. He knew the song — every man did who’d spent months on the line. His whistle was low, steady, and it blended with the metallic chorus around him.

Spur padded close at his side, her paws silent against the dirt. Her head swayed gently as she walked, nose twitching, ears flicking at every noise beyond the clamor of the tools. Men kept their eyes on their work; Spur kept hers on everything else. The shift of brush. The whisper of wind. The faintest tang of something sour on the air. She moved like a shadow among them, watchful in ways no man could ever be.

The early morning crept towards noon, the sun climbing higher and washing the camp in blinding light. What had been cool shadows now gave way to a shimmer of heat across the rail line. To the sides and back stretched nothing but open desert, hard and pale under the sky. Ahead, the land rose in broken hills and mountains, and tucked between them lay a canyon oasis. On the right days it tempted the men to work faster—set camp in its shadows, drink from the cool water that bubbled up from the earth. But until Boone gave the word, no one went there. The only one who ever came and went freely was Spur, trotting at Boone’s heels on nearly every hunting trip.

Boone stopped mid-stride, flipping open the silver lid of his pocket watch. He grunted, the sound deep and short, then snapped his fingers at Spur. The dog’s ears perked.

“Alright, girl,” Boone muttered, “let’s find Isaiah.”

Together they walked through camp, past the clank of hammers and the groan of rails being set. Boone made his way to the cluster of tents and crates where their equipment was kept, but Isaiah was nowhere to be found. He turned to a nearby worker.

“You seen him?” Boone asked.

The man shrugged. “Said he was looking for someone that wasn’t on the line. Maybe slacking off somewhere.”

Boone sighed through his nose and crouched low, tapping his knee to draw Spur in. Her tail wagged as she padded closer. He scratched her head once, firm and quick.

“Go on, girl,” he said. “Find Isaiah.”

And like that, Spur was gone. She bolted between the tents, sniffing at the dirt and crates, circling until the right trail caught her nose. Then she shot forward, weaving through camp and out toward the open desert. Her paws drummed a steady rhythm, ears bouncing as she ran. The hot earth rose up around her, and the air carried Isaiah’s familiar scent—iron, sweat, and the faint leather of his boots. The trail pulled her onward, toward the direction of the canyon.

Spur’s paws kicked up dust as she charged through the hot stretch of sand and brush. Her tongue lolled out, ears flopping as her nose stayed low to the earth. Every so often she’d stop to test the air, turning her head this way and that before bounding on again. The desert was alive with scents—sage and greasewood, the faint tang of iron from the rail, the sweat of men—but beneath all that Spur caught the one she was after.

Up ahead, a tall figure broke from the haze and shimmer of the rising heat. Broad shouldered, standing easy despite the rifle on his back, Isaiah was already watching her approach. His thick beard pulled into a smile as Spur yipped and barked, skidding to a stop at his boots.

“Well now,” he rumbled, bending at the knee and giving her a solid rub between the ears, “Boone finally get tired of you and send you my way aye?”

Spur’s tail wagged furiously, her body twisting with each swipe, but she barked once more—sharp, insistent—before spinning a little circle in the sand.

Isaiah chuckled low in his chest. “Ah, I know that dance. Boone’s looking for me, ain’t he?” He straightened, tugging the canteen from his belt for a sip before tightening it back down. With a glance over the dry stretch behind him, he muttered, “I take it Boone’s too busy to go on a hunting run,” 

Spur just stared up at him, tongue lolling, eyes bright and unblinking.

Isaiah chuckled, straightening and slipping the rifle from his back into his hands. “Well, guess we can kill two birds with one stone. I think one of our slackers snuck off toward the canyon. We find him, and we scare up some hares while we’re at it. Sound good to you?”

Spur barked once, sharp and eager, as if the matter were settled.

“That’s what I figured,” Isaiah said, jerking his chin toward the horizon.

Spur wasted no time. She bolted ahead, weaving through scrub and stone, her paws kicking up little puffs of dust that glimmered in the sun. Isaiah followed at an easy lope, rifle balanced against his shoulder, his long shadow trailing behind.

The canyon rose up to meet them, carved like a great scar in the earth. Its walls loomed high, jagged teeth of sandstone biting into the sky. Long shelves of overhanging rock cast dark, cool shadows that promised relief from the punishing heat above. The only way in was a single winding trail that sloped downward into the gorge. Spur reached it first, paws skittering on the incline, before slipping into a steady trot. Isaiah followed close behind, boots crunching on the grit as the desert sun gave way to the canyon’s shade.

At the bottom of the trail the world shifted. The sun’s bite faded, replaced by a cool dampness that clung to Spur’s fur. Patches of green broke through the canyon floor, ferns and grasses sprouting in little islands where shadows and soil had gathered. High above, the jagged stone still blazed with sunlight, but down here it was hushed and still, save for the roar in the distance — a river, hidden until now, bursting from the earth itself to snake along the canyon floor before vanishing back beneath stone.

Isaiah breathed deep, boots sinking into the softer ground. “Alright, girl,” he said, nodding ahead. “Go get ’em.”

Spur gave a quick wag of her tail and trotted off, ears pricked and nose twitching. The world was alive down here, rich with scents stacked on scents, each one its own story. Rabbit trails, bird droppings, damp stone, water spray, dust. She sniffed greedily, sorting through the invisible layers, tail swishing as she padded farther away from Isaiah’s view.

Then it hit her — a sharp stink to wrinkle any human’s face. Some animals had marked the ground here, rank and strong. Spur lowered her head to it, nostrils flaring, the musk filling her chest like something rare and wonderful. To her it was irresistible.

She froze for a heartbeat, then toppled sideways, rolling full into the spot. Her paws kicked at the air, twisting and jerking as she ground her back into the scent, tail thumping, soft happy grunts slipping out of her throat. It was pure bliss, a little secret delight.

After a good roll she scrambled upright, shook herself until dust and bits of green flew from her coat, and gave a snort. Then her nose went back to work, pressing low to the ground as she nosed deeper into the canyon’s patchwork of smells, eager for whatever lay ahead.

First let me tell you a bit about me. I am an energy person I believe people have an energy to them. Bad energy will take over and ruin things around them plants animals and people. My MIL(49)
moved in with my husband (33) and I (33)about a year ago. When we talked about her moving in I had told my husband as a reset get your shit together kind of move. I told her not to worry about working because again this was not suppose to be permanent. Just help out around the house and with the kids. From the start she made comments about being around (living with us) when my son turned 13. He was 9 at the time. Now it’s almost been a year and she doesn’t help clean. Every time I buy the kids snacks or drink she will eat them and when my son ask to get a snack there will be none left. I don’t like smells so if I cook I open windows to avoid trapping smells and I’ve asked her to do the same especially when cooking bacon (she won’t unless I’m there). We drink coffee everyday and if i take my son to school and he leaves his bowel of cereal in the sink and she finishes her coffee she won’t wash his bowel just her cup. I’m not ocd but I keep my house clean even with a toddler running around I keep up with his mess. so all in all I am a very particular person to say the least. My mom would keep my son and she never took money from me but when she moved in I’d give her $20 every day she kept him just so she had something. I stopped working so I wasn’t giving her money anymore. I’d give her $100 for her phone and Hulu account and vapes. We paid for everything else. Now when it comes to my kids I have a preteen who I am trying to make independent ( do laundry, small snack, use microwave) he knows he is suppose to do these things on his own. And I’ve told her stop doing these things for him or he won’t ever learn to do them. My toddler is think Donny from the wild Thornberries. He is a messy, wild child  and he will throw a fit like no other. If he is ever doing that I won’t let anyone take him away I will sit him down until he calms down on his own ( he sits in a chair and we try to count to 10 until he can do it without losing it). She has tried to take him when he does this and I’ve told her know no I got it. Apparently I am stopping her from spoiling my children. This is just the tip of the iceberg.   Now I decided to talk to my husband about my issues ( I did not name them all here). I told him how I am no longer comfortable and I was never on board with her permanently moving in. Well she has told him I don’t let her do anything ( by this it’s the things she chooses to do not things I need help with) and she feels uncomfortable around me too. His answer was I don’t know what to tell you!! Like wtf man I never talk about my issues and this was your freaking answer.

1njnls8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1njnls8/cant_figure_out_whats_wrong_with_my_head_and_eyes/,Can't figure out what's wrong with my head and eyes,"27M, 5’77” (16 cm), 165 lbs (75 kg), Caucasian, located in EU. No smoking, light alcohol and coffee. Duration of complaint: \~5 years (worsened in last 2 years). Various chronic conditions, worsened quality of life due to eye and head pressure/pain flare ups.

I'll try to be as concise as possible. Please, if you can, help me find a direction and solve this nasty condition.

Primary Symptoms are chronic fatigue/brain fog, daily eye strain with visual disturbances such as depth perception problems and dizziness from motion. I wake up exhausted with a heavy head. I get pressure headaches behind my eyes (especially right side) and temple, and my eyes are sensitive to light and motion. I have some visual snow and slight ghosting around objects from time to time. It’s hard for my eyes to focus or track moving objects - busy environments or computer use make me disoriented. This is worse in the morning and towards end of the day. I also have off-balance feeling (dizziness without true spinning vertigo). These symptoms flare especially after long visual tasks or being in bright, stimulating places.

Sooo history. I have mild myopia (-1.5) and wearing my glasses sometimes makes the eye strain/dizziness worse, so I constantly juggle between putting glasses, shades and waring nothing. I have dry eyes (diagnosed by ophthalmologist) and did a course of steroid eye drops with minimal improvement. I have a history of nighttime bruxism and TMJ jaw clicking, so (muscle tension, jaw bone is fine according to surgeon) mornings often start with a sore jaw and headache. I also have tinnitus and my right ear is often clogged. I also get neurological tingling in the right part of my jaw and neck. That also comes and goes from day to day or even in the same day. I think this got triggered by an EBV infection, but Im not a 100%.  
Medical tests so far: Brain MRI without contrast (normal except small cyst on pineal gland, which doc said is fine), EEG (normal), neck artery ultrasound (normal). Some lab tests were normal (thyroid normal, inflammatory markers normal) except very low vit D and double MTFHR mutation, which I both tried to normalize and felt a slight mood/energy boost. I also have chrnoic high ASO titer (500) indicating a past strep infection, but it never goes down (weird, but don't think its connected to main symptoms).  I had mononucleosis (EBV) about 7 years ago. No known autoimmune disorders. Sleep apnea is also excluded.

Doctors. My neurologist didn’t find obvious signs on exam and suggested stress/anxiety might be a factor (I am addressing this, but these symptoms occur even when I’m not feeling anxious). My eye doctor attributes a lot to dry eye, but honestly the severity of my vision issues seems beyond just dry eyes. No one has given a unifying diagnosis yet.

**Question:** What possible conditions could cause this combination of chronic **visual hurdles + motion/light sensitivity + head pressure** with mostly normal test results? I’ve read about things like vestibular migraine, VSS (though it seems a bit exotic at this point)?

**What kind of specialist should I see next, or what tests might be worthwhile** given the normal MRI/EEG?  I am planning a visit to a neuro-ophthalmologist, but it's taking forever.  I’m looking for directions to pursue because this is greatly affecting my life. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks.

L-methylfolate – 400 mcg  
Methylcobalamin (B12) – 500 mcg

My gut says yes, but I'm having doubts.","I’m 23M, single, working remotely, and still living with my parents in Pittsburgh. I have a relatively good home life, but I feel claustrophobic and uninspired here. I want to start my own life, and I’ve set a goal of moving out by the end of this year.

This summer, I had this gut feeling that I needed to visit Kansas and see the great plains. I’ve lived in the desert of Arizona, the forests of Massachusetts, and now the cloudy hills of Pittsburgh, so I wanted something different. I took a week-long solo trip, starting in Manhattan and ending in Kansas City, and KC surprised me. I LOVED it. It felt so familiar to me... almost comfortable?

I didn’t expect to like it as much as I did. The tree-lined roads, the greenery, the food scene, the many parks, the more spread-out feel compared to East Coast cities… it all just clicked. My gut tells me KC could be the right place.

At the same time, this would be my first time living on my own. I’d be far away from family, and everyone I’ve told about KC gives pushback like, ""Why Kansas City? There’s nothing there."" That makes me second-guess myself. I’ve also visited Philly (my second choice), NYC (too expensive), and Raleigh (not for me), but none of them felt right. KC is the only place that did. On top of that, KC is also much more affordable.

I know this sub sees a lot of posts from people debating moves like this, so thanks for bearing with me. I guess what I’m really asking is:

* How do you know when it’s the right time and place to move out on your own?
* Has anyone else taken a leap like this, moving somewhere that just felt right even if others didn’t get it? How did it turn out?
* How do you deal with the fear that you’ll screw it up, that you’ll move, feel miserable, and regret it?

Some context about me:

* Budget: around $1,200 for a 1-bed or studio
* For people familiar with KC, I stayed in Valentine on my trip and liked it a lot. Plaza area is also on my radar
* I want something comfortable, green, relatively safe, with groceries, coffee, and parks nearby.

I know logically I could try KC for a year and pivot if it doesn’t work out, but emotionally it feels like such a huge, scary first step.

Would love to hear from people who’ve been in a similar situation, whether you moved to KC or anywhere else that just clicked. How did you handle the leap?",2,1758138967.0,SameGrassButGreener,1,0.75,False

Now going through HDDT. Scroll to end to see how I'm feeling (pretty good, considering) and what I've done adjunct to the antibiotics/acid reducer to help minimize the side effects & collateral damage to my gut. It's honestly going quite well, so far, especially compared to the terrible side effects folks report during triple & quadruple therapy.

About 8 weeks ago my left ear was suddenly full feeling and not “poppable” by yawning, blowing out with nose plugged, etc. Neti pot, saline decongestant, nothing worked. It was annoying and progressed to some tinnitus & minor hearing loss (high frequencies), as well as some lightheadedness/dizzyness, so I went to my general practitioner, who gave me an ENT referral, which was booking out months. Shortly after the GP visit, I began to notice a feeling of a lump in my throat, and could also feel everything I swallowed as it went down. Then the symptoms really started to pile up. Gas & bloating was pretty significant, so I adjusted my diet to be more fiber rich, whole foods only, and gut friendly (really to no avail). My chest started feeling tight, and laying down at night, I started getting what felt like spasms in my esophagus. A couple days later, my chest was feeling very tight, it felt difficult to get breaths in (but not out), and I felt quite lightheaded and faint. I went to urgent care, where they said my vitals were good and that I should go to a GI specialist or an ER because they couldn’t do anything for me. 

In this meantime of escalating & multiplying symptoms, the things I tried were as follows: I gradually reduced then eliminated coffee, stopped all alcohol intake (I had a really bad night following one drink at dinner so that was it for alcohol), and tried omeprazole for two days. The latter made my symptoms much worse so I stopped that and started taking famotidine instead, which seemed to help. I also took an alginate (Reflux Raft) after every meal, which also seemed to help. I scheduled a follow up with my GP but it was a week out. The ENT she referred me to doesn’t take my insurance (a HMO), and neither do any other ENT’s or GI’s in my area (I’ve since changed my insurance to a PPO, which is a frickin racket, b/c the PPO has a lot more costs for the patient). A few days after the urgent care visit, the tightness in my chest, shortness of breath, and pretty severe lightheadedness had me scared enough to brave the ER in my town. There they basically operate on the premise of “we can tell you what it’s not.” I guess the good news was that the CT scan of my head was clear (no brain tumor - don’t we all think we have a brain tumor?), the x-ray of my lungs was clear, the EKG was good, my blood work was good (a little elevated in areas that indicate anemia-ish). They gave me an ENT & GI referral & sent me on my way (5.5 hours later, lol). At my GP appt a few days after the ER visit, I’m telling her all of the above, and also adding that I have never had GI issues over my 50 years. I’ve always been able to eat indiscriminately, fatty, fried, raw, you name it, whatever - with no GI concerns. My bowel movements have always been great & like clockwork. I should also add that I’m a 5’5” & 125 lbs female (normally, losing some weight now), very athletic (high level athlete until retiring from soccer in my 40’s & still work out 6 days/week, very active), and I eat almost all organic, local and minimally or non-processed foods. I eat omnivorously, and have eaten paleo-ish on and off in the past. My GP hears all of this and orders a h pylori breath test, an upper GI series (barium swallow), and an endoscopy. The breath test is quick - I scheduled it for the next day. The GI series is scheduled for late October (their first available). I got the breath test results back and you guessed it, h pylori DETECTED. My first response was YES!! Something that can now be treated, I now have some direction! Then I started reading about h pylori infection and treatment. Ugh. 

I did a ton of reading and decided to do high dose dual therapy (HDDT) of amoxicillin 3000mg + vonoprazan (Voquezna) 40mg daily for a few reasons. I am antibiotic sensitive (azithromycin was a nightmare for me in the past so clarithromycin is out) so I would anticipate pretty intense side effects from a triple or quadruple course; I don’t have an amoxicillin allergy. I reacted pretty poorly to omeprazole, as well, so the idea of another option than a PPI, vonoprazan being a PCAB, sounds like a good thing. I’ve also been stockpiling all of the supports for my system, BioFilm Defense biofilm disruptor, and Biomatrix S Boulardii & Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium Strains. My GP attempted to prescribe Voquezna dual pak (brand name for amox & Voquezna packaged together) & the pharmacy rejected the prescription. I called a local pharmacy and the pharmacist there checked the manufacturer’s supply & said the Voquezna dual paks are out of stock/unavailable. My amazing GP then decided to put in a script just for amox & to give me samples of Voquezna, which they apparently have enough of for the course (30 pills). How rad of a move is that?! The vonoprazan/Voquezna is pretty novel, only having received FDA approval in 2024, so it’s apparently more difficult to obtain and, as the pharmacist I spoke to said, “fancy.” That’s a shame because the HDDT has been proven already to be as or more effective than the traditional quad or triple therapies & there are a pretty decent number of folks who can’t tolerate PPI’s (all of the -azole meds). 

Today (9/17/25) I’m on day 7 of the 14 day HDDT course. I felt kinda rough days 1-3, achy, lightheaded, headachy, generally meh, but not terrible & continued to work (I WFH) and work out, albeit less vigorously than usual. I am still having the tight chest & espophagus, lump while swallowing symptoms but I feel like my gas & bloating are a bit less. Otherwise, now on day 7, I feel pretty good for what’s happening to my system - headaches are gone, still slightly lightheaded, a little brain foggy. My bowels are fine & normalish, my appetite is normal, no gastric upset (just gassy/bloaty, still), I’m sleeping fine. I’d say I’m around 75%, which seems far better than what folks on triple or quad therapy report. 

Here’s what I’m doing - YMMV, as always:

First thing in am/7am:

* Voquezna 20mg
* Amoxicillin 1000mg
* Biofilm Defense x1 (enzymes supplement)

Mid-morning:

* Support Biotic x2 (probiotics supplement)
* Sublingual B12 x5000mcg

3pmish:

* Amox x1000mg

After dinner:

* Support Biotic x2

30-60 min before bed:

* Biofilm Defense
* Stomach Soothe tea from Soothe Naturals

Last thing/11pmish:

* Voquezna 20 mg
* Amox x1000mg

I’m also doing these things daily:

* Taking prebiotic fiber supplement with triphala (ayurvedic prokinetic for gut motility)
* Taking Soothe Naturals Stomach Soothe prebiotics + amino acids
* Drinking Kefir 
* Adding cultured yogurt to smoothie
* Avoiding GI inflammatory foods & liquids, eating whole grains, fibers, fruits, lean meats, fish or no meats, etc

She said yes we can, I explained to her that my behavior was totally friendly and that I have feelings for her and that I don't expect anything in return cuz I know she likes that guy. She said feelings are normal and they got in the way, I told her I need rejection she said fine I reject you.
I was chilling the whole time and happy. Then she said maybe she likes that guy and I shouldn't tell him. But then she proceeded to say she was glad she met me and was nonstop around me after that and was really red and almost started crying.
But the problem lies that the guy she is interested in is interested in another girl he told me that and I couldn't tell her that cuz it would be seen I was sabotaging her.
But I wish her luck and that she can have something with him.
But I don't understand why she is nonstop smiling and around me after I confessed and was red all the time.
I am happy that I kept our friendship and maybe love isn't for me, I have been rejected my whole life I don't think I will find someone who will like me like I like them (I am 17 btw).
Thank you for reading I appreciate it.

Edit: I asked her on coffee before and she agreed and had great one on one time and it was very flirty.

*   Only 2.4 GHz during setup. No drama pairing a couple Zigbee bulbs and a door sensor.
    
*   I mapped three tiles to **Coffee / Leave / Movie**, and the **dial** dims the hallway cans.
    

**Two surprises**

1.  Guests actually use it. The three tiles are clearer than a tablet dashboard.
    
2.  The dial beats touch sliders. Didn’t expect to like it this much.

1njncc0,https://i.redd.it/izzxb43p4spf1.jpeg,"Happy Rejection, My Alpha","Searching for a free link please.  From Facebook. 

I was the ghost in the packhouse.
I never wanted jewels or roses. Just one promise, one promise.
A cruise.
Alpha Shawn Ravenshade had sworn it once. “One day, when we’re free,” he whispered, “I’ll take you across the borders. Just us.”
That was before power. Before the throne. Before I became Luna in name, servant in truth.
On my forty-eighth birthday, there were no greetings. No howl.
After dinner, I asked, “Do you remember what you told me… on my eighteenth birthday?”
He didn’t look up. “Which part?”
“That we’d travel. That we’d run the world together. You said when the pack was strong and our boy grown, we’d go. Just us.”
He chuckled, sharp. “You think you deserve that? Look at you, skin and bone. The world isn’t kind to old wolves. You’re not like Marga.”
Her name cut deep. Marga… His brother’s widow. Golden. The pack’s jewel.
The twins, my grandsons, snickered, calling me a corpse. Even my son, Mark, sneered, “Wash my clothes, Ma. That’s what you’re good for.”
And Shawn, Alpha of this pack, let them.
That night, I opened my red suitcase. My scarred hands were steady.
I used to be someone. A Vale. Daughter of the strongest Alpha. A she-wolf born of fire and dominance, a Luna by birthright.
Now? I was just the ghost in the packhouse. But not for long. My wolf stirred in the dark, whispering a promise an Alpha like Shawn would soon regret. She was awake, and she was done bowing.
Because maybe… just maybe, walking away from this pack of ingrates would be the best birthday gift I could give myself.
--
Stella’s POV
I was never meant to be Luna.
I was meant to be the ghost of the pack house, the forgotten shadow trailing behind the Alpha whose voice commanded all, but whose mate was nothing more than a servant in her own home.
I never asked for jewels. Never asked for roses. All I ever wanted was one promise. One promise.
A cruise.
Shawn, Alpha of the Ravenshade Pack, had sworn it back when he still had a soul left in him. When his arms felt like home instead of chains, when the scent of his wolf was strong and true and not drowned in the metallic tang of blood and firearm powder.
“One day, when we’re rich,” he had once whispered into my hair, his Alpha aura warm and protective, “I’ll take you around the world, baby. Just us. The moon and the sea, no one else.”
But that was before the empire. Before money and power corrupted his wolf. Before his heart turned to steel. Before, I became his Luna only in name and his servant in practice.
And today, today was my forty-eighth birthday. No one greeted me. No candles, no howl to honor my years, not even the smallest offering at the hearth. The pack celebrated everyone else. Just never me.
Maybe, just maybe… I thought it could be mine tonight.
I brought it up after dinner. He was in his leather chair, running that old, oil-stained cloth over a wolf-bone blade, polishing it like a relic passed down from blood to blood. The flatscreen muttered some forgotten Western, but no one was watching. My wolf whimpered inside me, small, weary, still clinging to a shred of hope.
“Do you remember what you told me… on my eighteenth birthday?” I asked, my voice quiet but steady.
He didn’t look up. “Which part?”
“That we’d travel. See the world together. You said once the business settled and our boy was grown… we’d go. On a cruise. Just us.”
Alpha Shawn chuckled, low and cruel, the sound rolling out of him like a growl from a wolf who had long since forgotten compassion. “Are you out of your mind? Do you think you deserve a cruise? Look at you, Stella. You look like a bamboo stick about to snap. You think any captain would roll out a red carpet for you? No, they’d mistake you for some stray mutt dragging fleas on board.”
My chest tightened. “But today is—”
“Today’s what?” His gaze finally rose, and I saw it, those amber wolf eyes, dulled, heavy, older now. “You’re not young anymore. The world isn’t kind to women like you. You’re not like Marga.”
The name hit like claws against my throat. Marga. My sister-in-law. His brother’s widow. Slim, golden-haired, all sharp perfume and silk dresses, a she-wolf who always carried herself like she belonged on the cover of a magazine. She judged me with her eyes every time we shared a room, and Alpha Shawn never once defended me.
“She’s younger,” he continued, “travels for business, makes appearances for the pack, represents the family. She’s part of the image. But you… You’ve always been the one behind the scenes. That’s where you belong. The house. The family. You keep things running.”
Behind me, the twins snorted. My grandsons. Wolves with fangs are already sharper than their manners.
“Yeah, Ma, you look like a skeleton in a funeral dress,” Ken sneered, his young wolf aura buzzing with arrogance.
“Smells like old mop water and dead cats,” Kurt added, pinching his nose.
They burst into cruel laughter. No one stopped them. No one ever did.
Mark, my son, both my pride and my shame, leaned against the fridge, his scent sour with beer and frustration. “Hey, Ma. Wash my clothes, yeah? My wife’s busy. And bleach the white ones this time. Unless you wanna ruin another set.”
“I’m not your maid,” I murmured.
His head snapped up, wolf energy crackling in the air. “What was that?”
“I said I’m not—”
A half-empty soda can slammed at my feet. “Then what the heck are you? Because you sure as heck ain’t doing anything else in this house! You don’t bring money. You don’t bring status.”
My blood boiled, my wolf stirring weakly inside me, though too suppressed to rise.
“I raised you,” I hissed. “Fed you. Keep you alive when your fever nearly took you. I’ve been working since before you were born.”
“Well, maybe you should’ve worked on smelling better,” one of the twins piped up.
“Yeah,” Kurt sneered, “our classmates say you look like some rogue wandering in from the wilds. Ugly enough to scare a whole pack.”
They laughed, voices ringing like knives in the hollow of my chest.
Alpha Shawn only reached for his wolf-bone blade,inspecting it as if it were worth more than me. “We’ve got money, Stella. Plenty of it. But I’m not wasting it on useless help. You’re here. You’ve got two hands. Why would I hire a maid when you’re already chained to this house? Besides, I never liked more omega wolves running around the pack house.”
The woman of the house. That’s what he called me. But I owned nothing. Not a car. Not a card. Every cent I needed, I had to beg for. And if I dared to ask for more, he demanded receipts, penny by penny, like I was some rogue to be monitored.
That night, when the noise died down and the wolves retreated to their rooms, I pulled out the old red suitcase from the closet. The one Alpha Shawn had bought me in Australia before our wedding, back when he had sworn to be my Alpha, my mate, my world.
I stared down at my hands. They no longer looked like mine. Lined. Broken. Calloused from work that was never acknowledged.
I used to be someone. A Vale. Daughter of the strongest Alpha. A she-wolf born of fire and dominance, a Luna by birthright. I gave it all up for love, turned my back on my bloodline, thinking an Alpha like Shawn Ravenshade’s bond was enough.
And now?
Now I was nothing. A ghost in a house of wolves.
No kingdom. No crown. No mate is worthy of the bond we once swore under the full moon.
Maybe… Just maybe, leaving this family, leaving this pack of ingrates, was the best gift I could give myself on my birthday.
Because I was done being a ghost.
And somewhere deep inside, my wolf stirred, whispering that the night was still mine.


Chapter 2
The next morning, the news came to me the way most truths did, sloppily, thoughtlessly, thrown like scraps.
Ken, crumbs clinging to his shirt, spoke with his mouth full of crisps. “Marga rented the whole top floor of the Starview Hotel! Big feast. Dad says it’s for us. A pack celebration.”
I paused mid-mop, the wooden handle slick in my palms. “Us?”
Kurt’s smirk was sharp enough to cut. “Not you, Ma. Grandpa said you’re… not up for it. I mean, look at you.”
Not up for it. As though I were sick. As though I were fading. As though I were a wolf too weak to even matter.
By sunset, the house had shed its noise. Alpha Shawn had shaved, combed back his silver-streaked hair, and doused himself in that rare cologne he reserved only for funerals or blood-oath gatherings. He looked every inch the Alpha he once was, broad-shouldered, commanding, untouchable. He adjusted the twins’ collars with the care of a proud elder while Mark smoothed the lapels of his best suit.
“Remember,” Alpha Shawn told them, his voice threaded with authority, “Marga does this because she loves us. She is family.”
The boys grinned, their voices cruel in unison. “That’s why we love Marga more than Grandma Stella.”
No goodbye. No promise to bring me back a plate or even a whisper of acknowledgment. Only the door shut with the finality of a coffin lid.
Silence settled in the pack house. Not the peace of quiet, but the hollow echo of being forgotten. It rang louder than any slap.
I stood in the hallway in my worn slippers, clutching a basket of unfolded clothes. My stomach growled, but I hadn’t cooked. Why feed a ghost?
Out of defiance, I switched on the television.
There they were, projected larger than life on the evening broadcast. The Starview Hotel sparkled with crystal chandeliers, golden candelabras, and the low hum of violin strings. Marga glowed in her white fur shawl, Alpha Shawn beside her, my son and his mate smiling with the polish of politicians. The twins, Ken and Kurt, raised soda glasses in tuxedos tailored too fine for their spoiled shoulders.
The reporter announced it with reverence: “A private Ravenshade Pack gathering- Marga Hartclaw’s homecoming. The family behind one of the most powerful shipping empires in the country.”
But I was not in the shot. Not in the story. Not in whispers.
They toasted with champagne. I sipped stale coffee.
They laughed under gilded chandeliers while I wiped a smudge from the glass door.
Then came the cut deeper than any blade, Marga leaning toward Alpha Shawn, whispering something that sent both of them into laughter. My son joined in. I didn’t hear her words, but my wolf bristled. I felt them. And I knew they were about me. The bond between wolf and insult does not need translation; it burns through the bones.
**
Hours later, well after midnight, the front door open. My heart leapt, foolishly, thinking perhaps my son, Mark, had returned to me. But no. It was them.
Marga entered like she owned the ground she walked on, her heels striking the marble with the confidence of a queen. Alpha Shawn leaned heavily against her, drunk and pliant, his tie undone, his lips still stained with wine.
“Oh, Luna Stella,” she cooed, smirking when she found me rooted at the staircase like a phantom. “Didn’t think you’d still be awake.”
She steered him forward, arm entwined with his as if she were his Luna instead of me. “Mark and the boys are staying at my penthouse. Too tired to come back. But Alpha Shawn…” She patted his chest possessively. “Well, he can’t rest in strange beds. Poor Alpha.”
I recognized the lie immediately. She was not helping him home; she was parading my replacement in front of me.
From her bag, she pulled a container and tossed it carelessly at my feet. “Leftovers,” she said, her tone mocking sweet. “Go eat, Luna. You look like you weigh thirty kilos at best. A wolf that frail wouldn’t last a hunt.”
I didn’t move. My fists clenched, nails biting into my palms. My wolf snarled low inside me, desperate to lash out.
“I’ll put Alpha to bed,” Marga added, a sly curl on her lips. “I know you two don’t share a room anymore. He told me your side of the bed reeks of…”
“She looked me over from head to toe, as if weighing my every flaw and strength, measuring what I was truly capable of, then she continued.
“...disappointment.”
I stepped forward once. Just once. My hand twitched with the urge to claw her across the face. It would have felt good, almost holy. But I didn’t. Because the true knife came from him.
Drunk, his eyes glazed, Shawn smiled at her like she was the only star in the sky. “Marga’s so pretty,” he slurred. “Smells like peaches. My luna, Stella, just smells like dishwater and old arguments.”
They ascended the stairs together, his weight resting against her, her laughter echoing down the hall like a song of conquest.
And in that moment, I realized: they did not kill me.
They simply replaced me.
**
I waited. Not because I still cared, but because I needed to know.
One o’clock. Two o’clock. Still no sign of her leaving. The lights above remained lit, the silence heavy but alive.
Then came the sound. A thump. Then another. Steady. Rhythmic. Intimate.
My blood turned to ice. My wolf growled inside me, dragging me forward like prey tethered to a predator.
I climbed the stairs, each step heavy as stone, each breath sharp as broken glass. The hallway stretched like a grave path, leading me to the bedroom, the Alpha’s room that once had been ours. The door was ajar. I saw.
Marga, bare and shameless, straddling Shawn. Her red painted nails raked his chest like talons. Her head tossed back, curls wild, as she rode him with the hunger of a she-wolf in heat.
And Shawn, my mate, my Alpha of three decades, grunted beneath her, his hands gripping her like she was his salvation.
My knees threatened to give. My throat burned dry.
Her voice cut through me, a howl of mockery. “Alpha Shawn, ruin me. Fill me the way she never could.”
And Shawn, panting like a beast, exclaimed, “You’re perfect, Marga. You’ve always been the one.”
I fled, my wolf clawing inside me, screaming to tear them apart, but my body faltered. I stumbled into the downstairs bathroom, retching until my ribs cramped, the sound of their betrayal still pounding in my ears.
It was not about intimacy. It was about erasure. About being bared of my place in the pack, my mate bond rotting while another woman wore my crown.
They didn’t just want to humiliate me. They wanted to watch me wither.
But a she-wolf who survives this doesn’t stay curled on the floor. She waits. She remembers. And she learns to haunt quietly,
until the night she finally lets her wolf break free.

Chapter 3
I woke before the birds, not because of habit or alarm, but because the moon, waning but still strong, dragged me from sleep as it always did. No tears. No ache. Just the ragged pull of breath, shallow and sharp, as though the wolf inside me had grown weary of caging herself in flesh too fragile, too human. My skin prickled, veins humming with the restless thrum of something ancient. I washed my face with a damp cloth, tied my hair back, and marked my mouth with balm, not for beauty, but as a mask, a camouflage. Alive enough to play the part of the weak, docile Luna, they believed me to be. But beneath the surface, my wolf prowled, teeth bared in silence. And then I reached under the bed, where my true life waited inside a battered red suitcase, its scent carrying the promise of blood, freedom, and the moon’s call.
I slid it out and unzipped it an inch. Cash, collected from quiet sales, but never just empanadas or breads, as they thought. Men paid extra because their instincts, however dulled, whispered that something in me was different. A passport, bearing my maiden name, Stella Vale… An identity untainted by Alpha Shawn. And a photograph of me at eighteen, smiling with teeth too sharp for innocence, a wildness burning in my eyes before marriage dulled it into obedience. I shut it again before my pulse betrayed me.
The kitchen was dark, the air heavy with lemon cleaner and silence. I boiled water, cracked eggs, and sliced bread. My hands moved on their own, the motions so ingrained they felt more like ritual than routine. Stir. Season. Flip. Feed. That was when I heard them, bare feet padding across the hardwood floor. Her laugh first, honey-sweet and venomous. Then his voice, low and indulgent, as if he had forgotten entirely that this was still my house.
Marga drifted into the kitchen in one of Shawn’s shirts, unbuttoned halfway, her hair messy from the kind of sleep that smells of skin. Shawn followed, freshly showered, reeking of soap and betrayal. Together they looked like honeymooners, radiant with appetite.
“Coffee, Stella,” she said casually, like I was the maid. “Make his strong, mine with cream. You know how he likes it.”
I placed the mugs in front of them without a word. Shawn sipped and smirked, not even sparing me a glance. “Bacon and omelet, Stella. Marga loves it the way I do. None of that salty mess you used to make. She’s watching her figure, not that it shows, huh?”
Marga leaned against my counter as though it were hers already, eyes bright with victory. “Not everyone wants to look like a stick wrapped in sadness, darling.”
I smiled then, not in surrender, but because baring one’s teeth was the oldest language of all. They didn’t notice. They had never truly seen me.
I cracked more eggs, let the oil sizzle, and pretended not to hear them recall the gala, the penthouse, the sheets that smelled of champagne. They spoke of me as though I were an afterthought, a shadow that clung too long. They did not know that shadows can bite.
The front door burst open then, laughter filling the house. My son Mark and his mate, Lydia, swept in with the twins. Lydia flaunted her new purse, her earrings, all “gifts” from Marga, while Mark poured wine before the clock had struck nine. The boys dragged in a massive framed photograph, the family portrait from the Starview Hotel gala. Marga at the center, with Alpha Shawn’s hand on her body, my children orbiting her like planets around a brighter sun.
I was not in the picture.
“Look, Grandma,” Kurt said, smirking like a wolf pup that thought itself grown. “Don’t we look like a real family here?”
“Too bad you weren’t there,” Ken added, grinning with all his teeth. “Oh, right! You were left behind. Guess you looked too much like the maid.”
The room howled with laughter, my blood with it, though for different reasons. Alpha Shawn laughed. My son laughed. Even Lydia wiped tears from her eyes. Marga sipped her coffee and said lightly, “Don’t worry, Stella. I’ll leave some of my old dresses in your closet. Maybe some perfume too. They’re a little snug on me now, but you might squeeze in.”
Shawn chuckled without looking at me. “You can dress a corpse in Versace, it’s still a corpse. And she smells like disappointment.”
Their laughter was deafening. But I only gathered their plates, washed them one by one, and stared out the window at the lemon tree blooming in the neighbor’s yard. They thought they had finished me. They thought this was the end. But they had never seen what I looked like when I stopped begging to belong.
**
That night, when the wine was drained and the house fell silent, I stood alone in the living room before the portrait. Hung high like a false idol, it glared down at me, Marga in the center where I should have been, Alpha Shawn beaming at her like she was the crown of his life.
I didn’t hear him approach until his voice cut through the dark. “What, jealous again?” His tone was jagged with contempt. “You stare at that thing like it’s gonna cry for you.”
I said nothing. Words were wasted on men who had already chosen blindness.
He sneered.“Come on, Stella. If I could turn back time, I would’ve left your sorry wolf to rot in the countryside where I dragged you from. Should’ve claimed Marga instead, at least she knows how to run a pack, how to keep her muzzle shut, how to stand beside an Alpha without stumbling.”
Still, I stayed quiet. Silence is patience. Silence is hunting.
His anger flared at my stillness. He kicked me hard in the knee, the pain exploding like fire under my skin, but instead of crumpling, I felt something uncoiled. He turned away, dismissing me as broken. “Enough drama. You’re too old for this matter.”
Then his phone rang, and with it, the transformation in his voice. “Hey, baby,” he said, warm and young again, as if I were already rotting in the ground. “Yeah, I’m packing. Can’t wait to see you in that bikini. Just you and me. Open sea.”
I stayed on the floor, not out of weakness but because the tremor running through me was no wound, it was awakening. A surge older than flesh, sharper than bone, a pulse buried beneath years of forced obedience. My nails carved crescents into my palms, my breath quickened, ragged, as though my lungs were too small for the beast pushing inside me. My teeth throbbed with an ache that was not human, begging to lengthen, to tear.
They thought they had broken me, erased me. But the moon was rising, and the blood in my veins had never forgotten the wolf.
They're wrong.

Chapter 4
 
I didn’t follow Alpha Shawn Raveshade.
He walked away still laughing, his voice pitched high and stupid, whispering about bikinis and champagne into Marga Hartclaw’s ear as though I were already gone, as though I were nothing more than the rug he wiped his shoes on.
He carried himself like a man renewed, shoulders squared and steps steady, while I remained on the floor, knees aching, pride cracked, and soul halfway gone, as if the very earth had claimed me while he walked away untouched.
I rose, slow and deliberate, my joints creaking like old doors. My palm smeared across the tile, gathering dirt, dust, and what little dignity still clung to me. I moved toward the bathroom and shut the door softly, careful not to wake the house. The mirror caught me in its unforgiving light: red eyes, swollen cheeks, hair unpinned and wild. I looked like someone who had tried to cry underwater and failed, someone who had already drowned but kept moving out of sheer habit.
There was no coffin, no candles guttering in the dark, no veils drawn or prayers whispered to the night. Yet I was in mourning. Not for him, not even for the ruin of what we had been, but for myself, for the girl I once was. The wild flame that laughed too loud, that clawed too deep, before I smothered her fire for his comfort, before I clipped my own wings and dulled my claws just to fit inside his grasp. I grieved for every part of me buried beneath quiet sacrifices, for each version of myself that withered when I chose him over me, until all that remained was a shadow, a husk, haunting the bones of the wolf I used to be.
He passed by the door then, his laughter low, edged with cruelty. His phone was glued to his ear, but he paused long enough to bark, “Pack my things. Business-leisure trip. We leave tomorrow.”
No glance. No “please.” Just command. Just ownership.
I nodded, though he wasn’t looking, and when the house swallowed his voice, I dried my hands on the crooked towel and went to his room like a servant obeying her master. His closet was chaos, suits collapsing into long-sleeved shirts, shoes buried beneath dirty socks. A man with the habits of a spoiled pup, yet he believed himself king.
I began folding his shirts, smoothing his linen with a precision I no longer felt. Then, when my elbow brushed the side table, a folder slipped and fell to the floor.
Inside were cruise tickets.
I read the names once. Then twice. Each letter sharpened until my vision blurred. Shawn Ravenshade. Margarette Hartclaw. Mark. Lydia. Ken. Kurt.
Not me.
Not even as an afterthought.
The cruise I had carried in my chest for thirty years, the promise whispered into my hair when I was eighteen, had been gifted to Marga as casually as one gifts a bone to a favored dog.
Marga’s birthday. He remembered hers. He never remembered mine.
I folded the tickets with care, as if paper could bleed. Then I packed his suitcase anyway. Shoes polished. Shirts ironed. Cufflinks shining like silver teeth. Mark came in without knocking, beer in hand, and told me to pack for him, too. And for the twins. Lydia’s perfume. Snacks labeled with love. They dumped their burdens on me, one after another, and left without thanks.
I obeyed. Because obedience had been hammered into me for decades, the way one breaks a wolf until it forgets the taste of its own blood.
Later, alone in my room, trembling, I let my mind wander back. To eighteen. To Alpha Shawn, when his touch was a promise, not a bruise. When his eyes had not yet hardened into steel.
He had sworn to guard me always. To build a future no pack or prophecy could tear apart. His words burned brighter than the blood-moon itself, and like a fool beneath its spell, I believed them. I believed him even when it meant defying my father, Alpha of the Vale, whose wrath was older than the mountains and whose wolf carried the bite of centuries.
“You are no daughter of mine,” he had snarled, his voice shaking the stones, his beast pacing beneath his skin. The ground itself seemed to bow beneath his fury. “Take that boy if you wish, but know this: your bond to me is severed. Crawl back to my gates, and I will rip your throat myself before I ever call you kin again.”
I had stood in the shadow of his dominance, my own wolf trembling but unbroken, and whispered through the storm of his rage: “I love him.”
“You love a shadow,” he spat, eyes gleaming with silver fire. “And shadows always devour their own.”
Thirty winters have passed, and his curse has come to gnash its teeth in truth. The boy I once loved, the mate I bled for, has withered into a man who can snarl me down, shove me aside, and never look back. A man who books moonlit voyages with another female while leaving me to scrub his boots as if I were nothing but packless prey.
And I finally understood. My father hadn’t banished me out of cruelty. He had recognized the rot long before I did.
I stared at the landline. Old. Forgotten. But it still worked. My hand moved before I could stop it. I dialed the number I had carried like a scar for three decades.
It rang. Once. Twice. A third time.
And then…
“Hello?”
His voice. Older now. Roughened with years. But still him. Still the Alpha of the Vale. Still my father.
My throat closed. I held the receiver like it was the last rope keeping me from drowning. Tears fell, quiet and relentless.
“…Father,” I whispered, the word splintering from me like bone. “…It’s me. Stella...”


Chapter 5
The line was still warm in my hand when I heard my father’s voice. His tone carried the weariness of a wolf who had howled through a thousand lonely nights, the kind of exhaustion that seeps into marrow and lingers like frost. Yet beneath it, there was a calm I hadn’t heard in decades.
“Come home, Stella,” he said, his voice roughened by age and silence. “I’ve been waiting for you for twenty years.”
Twenty years. Two decades of empty seasons. Of full moons where I stood alone, my wolf restless but shackled. Of battles I had fought in silence, my pride too sharp, my heart too wounded, my spirit too broken to return.
My knees threatened to give way, but instead of collapsing, I sank to the edge of the bed and let the tears fall freely, hot rivers cutting through years of restraint.
“I’m coming home,” I whispered, my voice no louder than a ghost brushing across the wind.
There was no further word from him, only the sound of his breathing, steady, real, grounding me like the heartbeat of a pack I had long abandoned. I hung up before I could weaken, before I could whisper a goodbye I wasn’t ready to say.
The door creaked open, and that was when Alpha Shawn appeared, sliding into the room like a shadow that had always belonged there. His scent hit me before his words, bitter wine laced with deceit, the musk of a wolf who had long since traded loyalty for ambition. His eyes locked on mine, cold and calculating, nostrils flaring like he could already scent the truth clinging to my skin.
“I know you saw the tickets,” he said, his smirk slicing like a blade across my already raw nerves. Six only. Me. Marga. Mark. Lydia. The twins. That’s it.”
My throat tightened, but I forced myself to swallow past it.
“You were never included,” he continued, his voice dropping into that dead calm, sharp as winter ice cracking beneath one’s feet.
Then came the mockery, his promise wrapped in poison. “When I get back, I’ll buy you a diamond set. Take you to Hawaii.” As if trinkets and faraway shores could mask the truth. As if he thought I could be distracted like some desperate she-wolf begging for scraps of affection.
He turned his back on me without another glance, leaving behind nothing but the faint musk of arrogance and the slam of the door, a sound that felt more coffin than closure.
The next morning, I moved like a ghost through the kitchen, preparing omelets, bacon, and toast. The scent rose sharply in the air, almost mocking me with the illusion of family. From the living room, the twins’ laughter rang out, high and wild, like wolf pups on a first hunt.
“This cruise is the biggest ever!” Mark howled. “We’re going to have so much fun!”
Their voices were innocent, bright, but cruel in their ignorance.
Marga soon arrived, her arms laden with takeout bags. She dropped them onto the counter with a deliberate thud, her smirk flashing like a wolf baring her teeth.
“I don’t like Stella’s cooking,” she announced, loud enough to echo. “It’s like chewing on cardboard, or swallowing salt straight from the shaker. Bland. Over-salted. Completely uninspired. Just like her.”
Her words hit like claws raking across my ribs. The twins giggled. Lydia leaned in, her grin sharp.
“Honestly, Mum, it’s sad. You cook like you’re punishing us. Like every burnt edge is your little rebellion. But we see right through you.”
Invisible, I faded into the background, a shadow in my own home. Their words bared me down until only bones remained. Still, I clenched my jaw, swallowing the bitterness before it could burn my mouth.
Then Alpha Shawn’s voice cut through the room like a whip.
“Where’s my wallet?” His eyes snapped to me instantly, burning with suspicion. “You’re hiding it, aren’t you? Always hiding. Hiding from respect, hiding from responsibility. Useless. Jealous. Nothing.”
I shook my head, but he didn’t wait for the truth. His hand lashed out across my face with a crack that echoed like a breaking bone. My head snapped sideways, blood flooding my nose. The world spun. My wolf stirred within me, howling in pain, clawing at the cage I had built around her all these years.
I crumpled to the cold tiles, the scent of iron filling the air.
Marga’s voice was sweet poison. “Oh, Alpha,” she purred, pulling his wallet from her bag with a smirk only I saw. “I must have taken it by mistake. How clumsy of me.”
The trap was perfect. The humiliation is complete.
They gathered their bags, voices light and cruel.
“Don’t worry, Mum, I’ll bring you a fridge magnet,” Mark said.
“And I’ll bring you a keychain,” Lydia added.
“We’ll bring you dirty laundry, Grandma,” the twins howled, their laughter cutting deeper than claws.
The slam of the door left behind a silence so sharp it felt alive.
I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I simply rose, went to my room, dropped to my knees, and dragged out the old bag I had hidden long ago. My hands moved steadily, deliberately. I packed only what mattered. The rest could rot with them.
At the airport, my phone buzzed.
Guard the house while we’re gone. We’ll be out for a week. Don’t mess anything up.
Another message followed instantly.
Sorry, I slapped you. But you provoked me. If only you weren’t always so jealous. You ruin things for yourself.
I stared at the words, and something inside me, something wild, something ancient, finally snapped free. I blocked his number, deleted the thread, and slid the phone into my pocket.
The smile that curved my lips wasn’t joy. It was the wolf inside me, stirring for the first time in years, baring her teeth in savage clarity.
I was done guarding a house that had never been a home.
I was going back to the only place that ever was.
Back to the pack. Back to blood. Back to the forest where my name still lived.

One day she tells me, “I want a reward system like Starbucks or McDonald’s.” Not because she thinks she’s a corporate giant, but because in a place with too many coffee shops and not enough customers, loyalty actually matters.

Traditional punch/fidelity cards? They suck. People lose them, forget them, or the ink rubs off. So… my girlfriend basically asked me to build her a rewards system similar to what Starbucks has.

I ended up creating FidelityPoints.com. It’s a rewards system for small businesses that only needs a phone and internet. Instead of stamping cards, you scan a customer’s QR code, add points, and decide what those points can be exchanged for: free products, discounts, prizes, or badges. The dashboard shows all transactions (email and date), so businesses can track everything easily.

Sure, there are other products on the market, some more advanced, even bundled with POS systems but our platform is the most practical for small businesses. It works with cash payments, is super flexible, and is the cheapest on the market at $9.99/month after a 30 day free trial.

Accounts take less than a minute to set up with Google sign-in. Right now, I’m still in the startup stage and mostly just want to know if this is useful outside my girlfriend’s coffee shop.

I get my work done, I'll talk to people if they interact with me, but I don't go out of my way to start conversations with other people or say ""Hi's"" and ""good morning's"". Like if a conversation starts, I'll engage and fake being happy to be a part of the conversation, but again, I don't start anything with anyone. 

When I was in college, I was fired from an internship 2 months in for ""Being too face down in your computer, you get your work done but you don't talk with us or drink coffee with us before the shift starts"", a few years later I was fired because ""You always look dead when I come into the office, you get great numbers but you're not really a part of the culture"" and then finally, this year I was fired because ""You always have a look on your face, you look distant, were supposed to be friends and family around here, the work is good, you just don't talk to anyone and stare off a lot""

Growing up, my family was poor. My parents always told me ""your coworkers and boss are not your friends, they'll find any reason to stab you in the back or throw you under the bus"". So I take that in stride with whatever job I have. I'll interact and do things normally, but I don't go above and beyond to start conversations or engage people.

1njn54a,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1njn54a/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy,"Using the ZWILLING 53105-100-0 electric kettle for a few weeks has been a surprisingly enjoyable experience for someone like me who thought ""a kettle is just a kettle."" This sleek and compact 1-liter cordless electric kettle is an efficient addition to my kitchen, and I found myself appreciating its thoughtful design and top-notch functionality much more than expected. Featuring German engineering and innovation, this product elevates boiling water for your tea, coffee, or hot cocoa to something you might actually look forward to. Plus, the silver, powder-coated finish adds a touch of elegance to any countertop. 

**Design and Build**  
The first thing I noticed was the kettle’s stylish and minimalistic appearance. Its double-walled body doesn’t just look good; it keeps water hotter for longer, while ensuring the outside remains cool to the touch—a big win for klutzy folks like me or homes with small kids running around. Its 9.37"" x 8.77"" x 9.6"" dimensions make it compact enough to fit even in a snug kitchen, yet the kettle isn't so small that you’re constantly refilling it. The manual-powder-coated finish is easy to wipe clean, and its seamless stainless steel lining ensures residue-free cleanup after each use.

**Ease of Use Features**  
What stood out immediately was the thoughtfully designed 70° lid opening. It prevents hot steam from blasting into your face when pouring water, which, if you’ve ever had that happen, you’ll agree is an underrated feature. The ergonomic handle also makes pouring feel steady and comfortable, even when full. No more worrying about sloshing water all over the place. Plus, this electric kettle heats up impressively fast, boiling water in just a few minutes.

**Good Points**  
- Double-wall insulation keeps the exterior cool and water hot.  
- Ergonomic handle makes pouring precise and effortless.  
- The sleek and minimalist design adds a modern flair to the kitchen.  

[Check ZWILLING 53105-100-0 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b09x6bhbfq/)

**Performance and Daily Use**  
Using the kettle daily for morning coffee and evening tea felt effortless. Its 1-liter capacity is sufficient for prepping multiple cups in one go. I was also impressed with how the kettle prevents any accidental burns with its cool-touch surface, which gives peace of mind as I'm constantly multitasking in the kitchen. An overlooked detail—this product operates relatively quietly, avoiding the loud racket that some electric kettles love to make. Every aspect of its function feels like it’s been fine-tuned for everyday convenience.

**Downsides**  
- Limited capacity might not suit larger families.  
- Pricier than some traditional electric kettles on the market. 

**Competing Products**  
Compared to competitors, such as the Cuisinart PerfecTemp or Breville IQ electric kettles, the ZWILLING 53105-100-0 holds its own because of its superior heat retention and quiet operation. While the Cuisinart model features multiple temperature settings, and Breville caters heavily to tea aficionados with advanced steeping controls, neither offers the seamless stainless steel body or cool-touch exterior that the ZWILLING kettle does. However, if you’re someone who absolutely needs precise temperature controls or a larger capacity, you might find better matches out there.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Without delving into exact numbers (because prices fluctuate), the ZWILLING 53105-100-0 feels positioned in a premium price bracket, but it is a solid investment if design and durability matter to you. It does feel a bit of a splurge compared to entry-level kettles, yet the enhanced experience it offers justifies the extra cost if you spend a lot of time in the kitchen or care about aesthetics as much as functionality.

This is a rant. 
I (F22) am currently in a constant state of anger towards my partner Josh (NB 22) . It’s not even a big rage it’s just built up. It was my birthday recently and I was pissed at the lack of planning or thoughtfulness. It’s always “what do you want” or “where do you want to go” and I have established as clear as possible that I don’t want to be in charge of it. We have been together 5 years. They didn’t take me out, despite me hinting at wanting oysters/seafood for 2 months in advance (knowing they wouldn’t have a clue but still getting my expectations up when they say they want to treat me). 

They work at a company that has been shady about schedules but usually they stand up for themselves and get it sorted out. This month the managers fucked the schedule again but Josh is just dealing with it this time. I understand there’s little power to change stuff with higher-ups but being a pushover now of all times makes me feel crappy. No plans happening and it just illuminates all the other times they said “we should go on a date here” or “I wanna treat you/spoil you” etc. they still spew those ideas with no follow through and I’m tired of entertaining the thought because that’s all they ever will be, concepts. I can’t remember the last time I wasn’t in charge of planning the dates/outings. Or any time they came up with a date idea and followed through with it.

I’m distant from them. They said last night they want to take me out to someplace (I’ve already forgotten) and I barely responded. 

On top of it, they have very little initiative in our home. We have two rascal cats that roam the apartment all night. So I have established a closing shift type thing where we set up the place for the night (clean litter box, no dirty dishes, clear floors and counters of trash and bags they could get stuck in, lay out toys for them to play in the middle of the night, etc). The last time I didn’t have to remind them to just do the litter box was after an argument we had about the perpetual lack of initiative. Which in itself is still a problem. Like you didn’t need reminders this whole time so now you’re doing it while I’ve let out my anger. It feels so weird. I’ll tell them I don’t want them to do the chore because or after I’m mad. It’s a confusing feeling. 

I do perceive them as someone who won’t do the litter box daily. And they take offense to that. The conversations/arguments just end with us either going to bed angry or us talking in depth about Josh’s feelings. “It really hurts that you see me this way” and I do feel guilty for thinking this way about someone I’m supposed to love. But what about all the shit they’ve done/didn’t do. All the mental load that I carry just reinforces this perception I regretfully have. 

On top of it, I see all these TikTok’s of married couples. There’s this one of a woman about a week away from having a baby and she’s scrubbing the tile of the shower while the hubby behind the camera narrates saying “here she is pregnant and on her hands and knees scrubbing the shower” and she sighs with a smile in response “ someone has got to do it”. And that phrase doesn’t reach their fucking brain and trigger at the very least an apology.  It’s just crazy nagging wives doing the unnecessary. 

There’s another one that was a skit from the man’s perspective and it would be funny if I hadn’t been charged up about it: it’s a dude on his phone with the caption “when I realize she asked me to make her coffee and I got side tracked doomscrolling and I hear footsteps” and the dude panics. 
The men in the comments are all about the “yeah I value my life” or “she could just do it herself if she didn’t want to wait on you” and the women are shyly saying “this lowkey annoying ”. 

What do you even do when you’re in a relationship like this? They are going to get therapy on Tuesday. They prioritized it because they feel so overwhelmed with chores and like they’re not being a good partner to me. 

Normally a loving partner would soften their gaze and comfort them. Oh it was all a depressive episode so they are going to fix it now and stop neglecting our relationship and our home that they also dirty. I don’t feel normal. I feel like this is just another phase. They’ll go to therapy and come back with goals and give me one good day of helping me with tasks that I do every day without bringing attention to it. Then it’ll be back to normal. I don’t have the energy to entertain it. 

I can’t even say something to sympathize with their overwhelm with chores. It’s valid. Maintaining our little apartment with two cats and a recent ant problem is hard. But it’s been a 90-10 split with half of that 10 being stuff I asked them to do. 

Every day there’s work, dishes, laundry, vacuuming, bills, homework, whatever. You get used to it when you actually do it. I hope they get their mental situation handled with the therapist but I’m not expecting any changes in anything but their self care. 

I just wish they’d stop lying to me and planting expectations. The other night they said they obsess over cleanliness and can’t sleep until closing shift is over. I didn’t say anything because I would only call bullshit. 

I just want to know if anyone else has any similar experiences? Partner saying things and almost never following through, leading to your eventual emotional shutdown. Additionally a lack of initiative in chores. What do you do to handle it? How do you deal with the angry and rude thoughts?

To give some background, he chats with the owner of the store occasionally and he has been single for 4+ months. I am also single but he’s seen me with my now-ex (we broke up over three months ago) so I’m not sure he knows I’m single. Anyways, he’s started smiling at me when he walks by (at least once per day, usually more) and it seems that he makes a point of making eye contact with me every time he passes by (multiple times per day). This has gone on for months but we’ve never actually said anything to each other apart from a quick hello in the hallway. The last few weeks I unfortunately have started to have a small crush on him and it’s a little bit agonizing, as I feel that if he was truly interested in me I’d hope he’d be more up front about it, but then again Im not sure he knows I’m single. 

I’ve thought about catching him when he walks by and breaking the ice, but timing is a little difficult as I’m not always available to do that. I would love a second opinion and I know I shouldn’t be nervous about actually  chatting with him for the first time but I am, as I can’t tell if I’m being a little delusional about the whole situation. I have a feeling he might be interested but again I’d want to be involved with someone that makes the first move. The coffee shop he frequents is very small and intimate and I’d feel nervous to go in there while he’s there, I feel like it’d be too obvious what I’m trying to do if I go in.

What should I do?,"I (30f) moved into a new apartment in August. The leasing agent (B) was overly personal from the start. She (30’s f) trauma-dumped during the tour, telling me all about her cheating husband and the traumatic birth of her now 5 y/o child. After the tour, she asked me to hang out, and we got coffee once before I signed. I didn’t think much of it, we’re in a smaller suburb and making friends can be hard sometimes. 

After I moved in, B started showing up unannounced at my door during the workday. I work from home and told her multiple times I do not accept drop-ins. I offered to meet outside of work instead and suggested happy hour twice, with specific days and times. Both times she ghosted the plan, then circled back days later with “are you home?” texts so she could drop by.

Last week I gave her one final invite for a Friday. She did not reply. Today she texted asking if I was home. I reminded her I don’t do drop-ins and said that since she ignored my invites I assumed she was not interested and I’m not looking to try and make plans anymore.

She responded with a long guilt-text about being “busy with evictions,” then 15 minutes later sent another one saying texted again saying she enjoys company (not my company, just “enjoys company”) and loves hanging out with me and hopes I enjoy the rest of my day, with a 🫶🏼 emoji. 

Now I’ve caught her driving by my unit multiple times on my Ring camera and then parking back at the office on the other side of the complex. I’m saving recordings and texts, and I’ve gone no-contact.

I feel creeped out. When is enough enough and I actually escalate this? Do I go to management now, or wait until it gets worse? At what point do I involve the police?

I’ve hear a lot of negativity around opening coffee shops (restaurants in general but especially cafes). 

I’ve also seen and heard tons of success stories and the shops around me have all been around for many years (the few that have closed, it was obvious after visiting the owners were the problem not the market). I realize this alone doesn’t tell the full story cause who knows if the owners have other income sources. 

I’ve seen some videos on YouTube discussing profits and they say the industry is around 10%. That seems very small for the amount of work and capital that goes into operating a shop. Does this seem correct?

I’ve been roasting coffee as a hobby now for years and feel like I’d like to do more (want to combine roastery with a shop rather than just roasting).

I realize it might not be the most profitable business but coming from corporate sweat shops I really want a career change and I need to be realistic about my potential income.

1njmsy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1njmsy0/delve_into_whether_the_shw_mission_desk_truly/,Delve Into Whether the SHW Mission Desk Truly Transforms a Workspace,"The SHW Mission 55-Inch Home Office Computer Desk combines aesthetic appeal with practical functionality, making it a reliable choice for both remote work and personal study. I’ve been utilizing this desk daily for a few months now and, though there’s a lot to love, there are some things you might want to consider before purchasing. Ideal for anyone seeking a modern yet classic setup, this desk fits seamlessly into various home office designs and offers plenty of workspace for multiple devices and accessories. 

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the clean, mission-inspired design of this desk. Its structured silhouette strikes a perfect balance between elegance and simplicity. Whether you’re outfitting a dedicated home office or just looking to upgrade a corner in your living room, this desk blends in beautifully. The black finish looks sleek without drawing too much attention. Personally, I find that it elevates the overall appearance of my office setup without overwhelming the space. The open frame design also makes the room appear airier, compared to bulky alternatives. 

**Generous Workspace**  
The 55-inch-wide desktop makes a noticeable difference. My usual setup includes two monitors, a laptop stand, a few notebooks, and the occasional coffee mug, and there’s still plenty of room left. On days when my nephew decides to work on his art projects next to me, the desk accommodates us comfortably. The workspace isn't just spacious—it’s ergonomically smart too. Underneath, there's sufficient legroom, and the open layout allows easy pairing with ergonomic chairs and even mobile cabinets for added storage.  

[Check SHW Mission 55-Inch Home Office Computer Desk price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b089dkv9mq/)  

**Sturdy Build That Holds Up**  
When it arrives, assembly might seem daunting, but trust me, the process is quite straightforward. My only regret was doing it solo, as attaching certain parts could benefit from a second set of hands. Once set up, the engineered wood desktop and powder-coated steel frame ensure stability. I’ve leaned heavily on this desk during extended meetings—sometimes in frustration—and it hasn’t so much as wobbled. For anyone who regularly deals with large monitors or other heavy equipment, you’ll appreciate the sturdy build.  

**Upsides**  
- Elegantly designed to fit almost any home setup.  
- Ample workspace that supports multitasking with ease.  
- Sturdy frame and durable materials provide long-lasting reliability.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Assembly can be tricky for one person.  
- Cable management features are lacking, leaving cords somewhat exposed.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this desk to alternatives in its class, I found a few noteworthy differences. When stacked alongside desks like the IKEA Bekant series, the SHW model comes out ahead in terms of price and durability but falls short on built-in cable management options. Desks like the Vari Essential Desk offer motorized height adjustment—a great addition for ergonomics—but they cost significantly more. If you’re prioritizing visual appeal and affordability with enough work area, this product stands toe-to-toe with high-end competitors without feeling inferior. 

**Price Performance**  
Considering all that this desk brings to the table—pun intended—it offers strong value for its price point. The materials, design, and functionality you get make it a cost-effective purchase. While it may not have premium features like adjustable heights or hidden storage compartments, what it does deliver is plenty of usable space and a highly appealing design. It truly feels like “smart spending” for anyone furnishing their home on a budget.

I was chilling the whole time and happy. Then she said maybe she likes that guy and I shouldn't tell him. But then she proceeded to say she was glad she met me and was nonstop around me after that and was really red and almost started crying.
But the problem lies that the guy she is interested in is interested in another girl he told me that and I couldn't tell her that cuz it would be seen I was sabotaging her.
But I wish her luck and that she can have something with him.
But I don't understand why she is nonstop smiling and around me after I confessed and was red all the time.
I am happy that I kept our friendship and maybe love isn't for me, I have been rejected my whole life I don't think I will find someone who will like me like I like them (I am 17 btw).
Thank you for reading I appreciate it.

Edit: I asked her on coffee before and she agreed and had great one on one time and it was very flirty.

1njmoue,https://www.reddit.com/r/drivingUK/comments/1njmoue/which_countrys_driving_licence_is_valid_in_the_uk/,Which Country’s Driving Licence Is Valid in the UK? (Story Telling),"# The Great London Lunch Debate: Can I Actually Drive Here?

Picture this: It's 1 PM on a drizzly Tuesday in London, and I'm sitting in the break room of my new office, surrounded by the most international group of people I'd ever met. There's Maria from Barcelona, fumbling with her car keys and looking slightly panicked. Ahmed from Cairo is scrolling through government websites on his phone, muttering something about forms. And then there's Klaus from Munich, completely unbothered, casually mentioning he's been driving his BMW around London for three years without a care in the world.

The conversation that unfolded that day and many days after became something of a ritual. Someone would inevitably ask the question that had been keeping them up at night: *""Wait, can I actually drive here legally, or am I one traffic stop away from disaster?""*

# The Golden Ticket Holders

Klaus, it turns out, had won the geographical lottery. As someone from Germany, an EU country, his driving licence was like a golden ticket. No expiration date, no paperwork, no stress. He could drive in the UK as if he'd never left home.

""I remember calling my brother back in Berlin,"" Klaus told us one afternoon, ""and he was so jealous. He said, 'You mean you just... drive? That's it?' And I said, 'That's it.'""

The same went for our colleagues from France, Spain, the Netherlands, and anyone from the EU or European Economic Area. They'd flash their home country licences with the confidence of someone who knew the system was on their side.

# The Lucky Few with Special Privileges

Then there were what I started calling the ""special club"" members. Sarah from Toronto was one of them. I'll never forget the relief on her face when she discovered that her Canadian licence meant she wouldn't have to start from scratch.

""I had nightmares about parallel parking tests,"" she confessed over coffee. ""Back home, I learned to drive on wide suburban streets. The thought of maneuvering around these narrow London roads while some examiner judged my every move was terrifying.""

Sarah's story had a happy ending. After driving legally for nearly a year, she walked into the DVLA office, handed over some paperwork, and walked out with a shiny new UK licence. No tests, no drama, no stress-induced insomnia.

The same privilege was extended to colleagues from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and Switzerland. They'd discovered they were part of an exclusive club, countries that the UK trusted enough to simply swap licences with.

""It felt like finding out you're on the VIP list at a club you didn't even know you wanted to join,"" laughed James from Sydney.

# The Long Road for Everyone Else

But then there was Priya's story, and it was a different beast entirely.

Priya had moved from Mumbai with fifteen years of driving experience under her belt. She'd navigated some of the most chaotic traffic in the world, could parallel park in spaces that seemed physically impossible, and had reflexes that would make a Formula 1 driver envious.

For her first year in London, everything was fine. She drove confidently, legally, with her Indian licence proudly displayed. But as month eleven approached, reality hit like a brick wall.

""I remember the exact day I realized what was coming,"" she told us. ""I was sitting in traffic on the A4, and it suddenly dawned on me, in one month, I'd go from being a perfectly legal driver to someone who couldn't even start the car legally.""

Priya's journey back to legal driving was a marathon, not a sprint. First came the provisional licence application, a humbling experience for someone who'd been driving longer than some of her colleagues had been alive. Then the theory test, where she had to learn UK-specific rules about roundabouts, road signs, and right-of-way protocols that were completely different from what she knew.

""The theory test was like learning to speak a new dialect of a language you already knew,"" she explained. ""I knew how to drive, but I didn't know how to drive *here*.""

The practical test was the final hurdle. Despite her years of experience, Priya found herself taking lessons again, unlearning habits that had served her well in Mumbai but didn't translate to London's streets.

""My instructor kept telling me to check my mirrors more frequently,"" she laughed. ""In Mumbai, if you spent that much time looking in your mirrors, you'd rear-end someone within minutes. But here, it's all about anticipation and courtesy.""

When she finally passed on her second attempt, the celebration was worthy of a promotion at work.

# The Translation Mystery

Throughout all these stories, there was always the subplot of paperwork and translation. Omar from Egypt carried around what looked like a small novel, his licence, translated into English, stamped, certified, and accompanied by an International Driving Permit that he treated like a precious artifact.

""I was pulled over once,"" he shared, ""and when I handed over this stack of papers, the officer looked at me like I was applying for citizenship right there on the roadside. But everything checked out, so off I went.""

The International Driving Permit wasn't magic; it couldn't extend anyone's legal driving period, but it sure made those interactions with authorities smoother.

# The Verdict from the Lunch Table

After months of these lunchtime discussions, we'd developed our own informal guide:

* **If you're from the EU**: Congratulations, you're living the dream. Drive on.
* **If you're from the ""special club"" countries**: You've got a year to figure out the paperwork, but it's just paperwork. No tests, no stress.
* **If you're from anywhere else**: Buckle up for a journey. You can drive for a year, then it's back to driving school, but hey, you might just become a better driver for it.

The most interesting part wasn't the rules themselves, but watching how people adapted to them. Some, like Klaus, barely had to think about it. Others, like Priya, turned it into a personal challenge and came out stronger. And a few, like Ahmed, decided it was the perfect excuse to embrace London's public transport system instead.

""Why fight the system when the Tube gets me everywhere I need to go?"" he reasoned, and honestly, he had a point.

These lunchtime conversations taught me that bureaucracy, while frustrating, often brings people together in unexpected ways. Nothing bonds colleagues quite like collectively trying to decode government websites and sharing war stories about driving tests.

And somewhere in London right now, there's probably another break room where someone is asking the same question that started it all: ""Is my licence valid here?"" The answer, as we learned, depends entirely on the story stamped in your passport.

I would take a nice break with a good book, a really good cup of tea and a mug that I loved and sometimes I would just sit in silence while I listened to the wind blowing through the trees, as many people were not even on the roads, so it was a lot quieter. The amount of time that I was outside was maybe between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the day. It meant everything to me and helped me to appreciate the tiny things.  

I love going to grab a cup of coffee at a few different cafes that I've started to love. I love the owners, employees and the overall vibe.

Sometimes it's  just drinking out of a mug that I really love. 

There's a road on my way to my childhood home that in the fall I never noticed how beautiful it was. I've only started noticing over the past couple of years. I now take time to pay more attention to the trees as I drive through it.

1njmn1s,https://i.redd.it/2d46pr3gzrpf1.png,The Music That Raised Us,"The 80s redefined what it was like to ""enjoy"" music and 'pop'-ular music was born.  
  
If you were raised in the ’80s, you didn’t just hear music — you *lived* in it. Often, you also *wore* it, *smelled* faintly of hairspray because of it, and *argued* about it with your parents who just didn't ""get it, man."" Twisted Sister made a video that became an anthem.

That decade wasn’t just a time period; it was a cultural supernova, reshaping music, fashion, and identity in one neon-lit, shoulder-padded explosion. Unlike the hazy, heavy sounds of the ’70s — *Floyd, Zeppelin, Sabbath* — which felt like they were constantly asking, ""Are you *sure* you're high enough for this?"" the ’80s was sharp-edged and electric. It didn’t ask you to understand it; it demanded you move to it. Preferably with awkward, angular dance moves only seen again in modern TikTok trends.

I remember saving up a monumental $10.99 for a new Van Halen vinyl, back when albums still had weight — literally and figuratively. You’d carefully slide it out of the sleeve, convinced that even looking at it wrong would cause a scratch that would haunt your ears for decades. And, if included, you'd read the lyrics to each song, identifying the ones that resonated with your cured sense of style. 

Meanwhile, a center aisle of cassettes was slowly swallowing up the record bins, like a slow-motion, plastic invasion. And let's be honest, 8-tracks never really manifested into a quintessential medium; they were like the beta-max of audio — a fleeting, clunky whisper in the wind. If you liked a band, your best access wasn’t a tweet or a TikTok; it was a magazine spread with glossy photos, oversized centrefolds of men whose hair defied gravity, and a roster of deviant 1-800 and 1-900 numbers lurking in the back, promising who-knew-what if you would only call.

Pop wasn’t background noise — it was atmosphere. It was the air you breathed, perpetually scented with cheap cologne and teenage angst. It blasted from ghetto blasters slung over shoulders that probably gave us all scoliosis, leaked from half-cracked bedroom windows, and bonded friendships with the unspoken agreement: **turn it up.** Even today, those songs get massive airtime. It's never been so good to be a Gen-Z'er. They're basically time travelers with better hair. We, the glorious analog elders, have a foot locked into the past (usually with a slight limp from carrying that boombox) and one in the digital downloads of today.   
  
If the power went out tomorrow for a week, we wouldn't just happily hum a week's worth of 80s music; we'd *perform* it. Full air guitar solos, dramatic keytar poses, the whole nine yards. We etched it into our minds, largely because there was no ""skip"" button on the radio. It was a time that anyone with talent and a tune, could be a ""one-hit wonder."" *(Spotify has 6 million songs, and half of those are from the last three years. How can anyone stay ""current""?)*

Wearing your band’s shirt was a statement – usually involving fluorescent colors or ripped sleeves. Wearing one from the concert was a badge of honor, proof you survived the sticky floors and questionable mosh pits.

Growing up in Vancouver meant we were on the edge — a city on the cusp, perpetually drizzly but musically vibrant. Big bands with big sounds came through, and if you were lucky, you caught the wave – often after standing in a line that snaked around two city blocks. Motley Crüe recorded at Little Mountain Studios. I met them because their location got spammed over the radio like it was part of the show – a primitive, glorious form of guerilla marketing. Guns ‘n Roses was a no-show one night and my little city rioted. Not a quiet protest, mind you, but a full-on, *""Welcome to the Jungle""* style riot. And let’s not forget the routine for accessing concert tickets: the hieroglyphic-era TicketMaster phone number, which you called incessantly, hitting redial until your finger cramped, hoping that one line would open up and get you seated in the lower nosebleeds, where the performers looked like action figures and the bass drum was just a dull thud.  But the experience was worth a week-full of story around school.

Then the ’90s rolled in — and with it, the growl of Seattle Grunge. Suddenly, the radio wasn’t for dancing anymore; it brooded, wore flannel, and probably needed therapy. My beloved pop-metal anthems faded into whispered recommendations, like a secret handshake among survivors. Thankfully, I had a very musically-evolved cousin and uncle, and both let me drift into their Venn diagrams of musical tastes, a safe harbor from the sudden angst. There were no sites to scroll, no playlists to surf. If you wanted to sit in music, you needed the physical ritual: cassette, player, patience. And a pencil. Because without that trusty writing utensil, your favorite tape was doomed to a tangled, unplayable mess. We learned resilience, people!

I never really found my footing in music after the ’80s. It was like graduating from a wild, loud party to a contemplative, slightly depressing coffee shop. But now I see a kid in a Nirvana shirt, and I get it. The virtual world gave them everything — forty years of curated sound, from bubblegum to breakdowns. Every song, ever recorded, is a few taps away. Lucky ducks. They'll never know the heartbreak of a snapped cassette tape.

Karaoke’s been around just as long — a testament to the enduring singalong. Music still unites. The 80s still gets the market share of attempts at the mic — as hits from the 80s were some of the catchiest tunes this side of the crucifixion. Probably because they were designed to be shouted from a car window at 60 MPH, not delicately crooned.

But every time a ’70s tune kicks in, it still hits me like a guy in a leather jacket with sideburns who just told me to ""mellow out, man"": a little too cool, a little too late, and definitely smelling faintly of patchouli. The 80s birthed a style that still creates careers. And the list of songs that have been re-recorded from ""my era"" keeps them contemporary. It was a great time to be alive. So is now but the virtual world loses the leg-work involved in getting hold of edgy music outside of mainstream.  The dream to tap a device a few times and bring up any piece is phenomena I routinely find surprises me with its simplicity. ",1,1758136964.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

So this year has definitely not been it. I mean, not to say that I haven't had my fair share of wins- 

1. I finally completed a course I've been doing, with a distinction because I'm that bitch.
2. I found out just how badass my corporate self can be. I didn't know I could honestly deliver value.
3. Even though I don't earn much, but I've been able to help out fam kiasi.
4. I've had some great sex, courtesy of a FWB (though there's a long story hapo)

While I'm thankful for all the blessings, this year has still tried me more than I thought possible. How you ask?

1. Experienced my first taste of racism at work - Wuehhh, I thought such stuff only happened in movies. Let me tell you I couldn't sleep for days.
2. Work and family drama has also been intense
3. Experienced been cheated on for the first time
4. Had a health scare - Haemorrhoids that lasted for months (courtesy of my FWB). By the way bottoms, just use good lube, and if it feels like it hurts, wacha tu. Haemorrhoids aren't pretty.

So back to where we are today. My boss just told me that I'm replaceable. Yes, fuck loyalty. Tell me why I was almost crying at my desk. So after work, I just walked to town, alafu just wandered for like one hour, got some good coffee at java, and some lovely cake, walked some more.

Right now niko kwa mat, ear buds on, Whitney Houston playing. I don't know what life has in store for me, but at least I can afford a smile. I don't know if there are any sad gays here. You're not alone. Sending love and hugs. 🫂

1njmlou,https://www.reddit.com/r/POSTcontentARG/comments/1njmlou/the_importance_of_custom_side_gusset_pouches_in/,The Importance of Custom Side Gusset Pouches in Modern Packaging,"In today’s global market, packaging is more than just a container—it is a strategic tool that influences consumer perception, ensures product safety, and reflects a brand’s identity. Among the many flexible packaging formats, the [**custom side gusset pouch**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style/side-gusseted-pouch) has gained prominence due to its unique design, versatility, and adaptability. Unlike traditional flat pouches, side gusset pouches feature expandable sides that allow for greater product capacity while maintaining a compact footprint. When customized, they offer even more benefits by aligning packaging design with brand values, product requirements, and consumer expectations. As businesses compete for visibility and customer loyalty, custom side gusset pouches stand out as a highly effective packaging solution across industries such as food, beverages, pet care, health supplements, and household products.

The first major advantage of custom side gusset pouches lies in their **innovative design and structural efficiency**. The gussets on either side expand when filled, maximizing storage capacity without increasing overall shelf space. This makes them particularly effective for bulk products like coffee, tea, grains, protein powders, and pet food. A flat bottom ensures that the pouch can stand upright, improving presentation and organization in retail environments. When customized, businesses can choose different sizes, shapes, and closures such as resealable zippers or one-way degassing valves. These added features enhance both functionality and consumer convenience, ensuring that packaging is not only practical but also tailored to specific product needs. The combination of design efficiency and customization makes side gusset pouches a superior alternative to rigid containers or traditional bags.

https://preview.redd.it/g8zvbq0kzrpf1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=70a5ab778a24ef47bf0e74b83186e6039d151d18

Beyond structure, **protection and durability** are central strengths of custom side gusset pouches. Manufactured with multiple layers of laminated films, these pouches offer excellent barrier properties against oxygen, moisture, and light—factors that can compromise freshness and product quality. For sensitive products like coffee or spices, custom side gusset pouches can incorporate advanced features such as foil linings or aroma valves to preserve flavor and aroma. The durable materials also resist punctures and tears, reducing the risk of damage during transportation and storage. Customization allows businesses to select the exact material composition that aligns with their product requirements, ensuring both safety and shelf life. This tailored approach enhances consumer confidence, as buyers are assured that the products they purchase remain fresh and intact until opened.

Equally important is the **branding and marketing potential** of custom side gusset pouches. With large printable surfaces on the front, back, and side panels, these pouches serve as powerful canvases for brand storytelling. Companies can personalize packaging with vibrant graphics, unique color schemes, logos, product details, and QR codes to engage consumers. The ability to apply different finishes—such as matte, gloss, metallic, or soft-touch—provides flexibility in aligning packaging aesthetics with brand identity. Transparent windows can also be added to showcase the product inside, enhancing consumer trust. In competitive retail spaces, such customization gives brands a distinct advantage by helping their products stand out, attract attention, and reinforce brand loyalty. The pouch itself becomes part of the marketing strategy, turning ordinary packaging into a memorable brand experience.

Finally, custom side gusset pouches are gaining recognition for their **sustainability and cost-effectiveness**. Compared to rigid packaging formats like glass jars or metal cans, pouches require less raw material and energy to manufacture. Their lightweight nature lowers transportation costs and carbon emissions, making them an eco-friendlier choice. With customization, brands can go a step further by opting for recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable materials, aligning their packaging strategy with global sustainability goals. This resonates strongly with modern consumers, who are increasingly making purchasing decisions based on a brand’s environmental responsibility. From a business perspective, adopting custom side gusset pouches not only reduces production and logistics costs but also improves brand image, creating long-term value. By combining eco-consciousness with practicality, businesses can meet consumer demands while contributing to a greener future.

In conclusion, the **custom side gusset pouch** represents a perfect fusion of functionality, protection, branding, and sustainability. Its expandable design optimizes space and convenience, while its customizable features ensure that packaging is tailored to specific product needs. The strong barrier properties guarantee product safety and freshness, while the large printable surfaces provide ample opportunity for branding and marketing. With eco-friendly options and cost-saving advantages, custom side gusset pouches are emerging as one of the most innovative and future-ready packaging solutions in today’s market. For businesses seeking to elevate their products, attract consumers, and embrace sustainability, investing in custom side gusset pouches is a strategic move that delivers both immediate impact and long-term benefits.",1,1758136871.0,POSTcontentARG,0,1.0,False

I start my day with a coffee and small splash of full fat cream . Allowing this has helped me to fast to lunch time easily . ( about 50 calories ) 

Lunch I do a cup of very salty beef or chicken broth and a serving of sugar free jello ( about 30-40 calories total ) 

For dinner , I make a very low calorie soup that a purée ( zucchini and cauliflower is my fave ) and a giant serving of this is about 50-75 calories total. I add a small portion of grilled chicken and sliced ice berg lettuce . ( total , about 350 calories ) 

I tried not eating at all on my fast days and as a woman , I really struggled around my period . As a mom , I also really struggled with keeping up with my toddlers.

1njmgz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1njmgz6/is_economic_isolation_fueling_the_rise_of_the_far/,Is Economic Isolation Fueling the Rise of the Far Right?,"I recently wrote about the rise of the far right, especially in light of the protest that happened on Saturday. What struck me most wasn’t just the rhetoric—it was how economic disparity isolates us. We’ve become islands of strangers: depressed, anxious, drowning in bills, and struggling to afford even basic social connection.

Young adults can’t find entry-level jobs that offer a life beyond rent and survival. Many live with their parents well into adulthood, while those who don’t face the loneliness of overpriced third places—£4 for a coffee, £6–£8 for a pint. What kind of intimacy, what kind of future, can grow in this soil?

So why are we still debating race, ethnicity, and the fantasy of “replacement”? What we’re living through isn’t cultural erosion—it’s the erosion of community, affordability, and quality of life. And I doubt that erosion is caused by families fleeing war and poverty. It’s more likely driven by men like Musk—men who haven’t read Orwell, yet claim expertise on liberty.

Do others feel this too? Is economic precarity making people more vulnerable to far-right narratives? Why does this rhetoric feel so normalised now?

The rise of the far right and growing concerns around mass migration have me thinking about how drastically public discourse has shifted since 2020. That year felt like a wake-up call—so many people stood alongside BLM, engaged in conversations about race, inequality, and systemic injustice.

But now, there seems to be a sense of reservation, even resignation. Some of the same voices that once joined the movement feel absent—or worse, aligned with reactionary narratives.

How did we go from collective reckoning to this quiet drift toward normalising far-right rhetoric? Is it economic anxiety? Burnout? Or something deeper?

I met my (me - M 24) LO (M 21) while organizing pride parade in one of city in Poland. He was with me in a group that was dedicated to keeping people safe. During the march, he introduced himself and said he'd enjoy working with me. When I was afraid to draw attention to people's behavior, he asked if he could help me and high-fived me. Later, he pointed out that there might be people on my side who would attack us, so if I wanted to be safe, I should switch with him. Then he reminded people not to smoke during the march. When I showed them I could try asking them to do so, he high-fived me again. After the march, he held my hand and told me I was a great person to our mutual friend. We were advised not to separate, and I didn't want to go home, so I asked if I could go somewhere with him. He said sure, but he was going to visit a friend of his in the hospital. I said I was okay with that. He even swapped seats with me on the bus to keep me safe and ride near the window. I liked that. I wanted to be taken care of. He always held the door open for me, even though I'm a trans guy (like him), swapped seats so I wouldn't have to walk down the street, wanted to pay for my ticket and our dinner at KFC, and wanted to borrow his jacket when it was raining. He also complimented me on my appearance numerous times: that I had beautiful hair, like a little owl, a great hairstyle, that I was a pretty person and I should accept that. That was what I wanted to hear. I asked him if he was in a relationship. He said yes. I asked if he was in an open relationship, and he replied that he wasn't looking for a relationship right now, but he is OPEN to friendships with kisses and hugs. He once joked about his partner: he said his parents were surgeons who helped him - my LO, so he needed them and couldn't break up with this guy. I'm in a relationship too. He wanted to see a picture of my girlfriend, I don't know why. We went to the afterparty of pride parade together. We separated for a while there because I was afraid I'd be annoying. Later, he messaged me and said I was an amazing and very kind person, and not annoying at all. However, we didn't get to say goodbye because he was tired. The next day, I asked him if he'd go for coffee, which he'd suggested during our first meeting. We arranged one meeting, but he canceled because he was tired from work. The second meeting. was supposed to be today, but apparently his boss called him to come early. But he said that he is sorry and he has present for me.

That same day, I had a fight with my girlfriend. She said I had many LOs and it always ended the same way: I am so depressed as if someone close to me had died (even if I knew these people for really short time) and it was cheating, even if I wasn't flirting, but only expecting flirt. I knew she was right. I thought maybe if I asked him if he liked me, and if he said no, it would be okay and I'd also set a boundary. I couldn't resist and called my LO.  I asked: ""Do you like me,"" even though he was at work. He was surprised and said he'd answer later. Later, he texted: ""Hey, you good?"" I replied: ""I'm having a bad day today and I asked that question without thinking."" He said: ""Hey, it's okay, don't worry. I'm flattered, but I'm not looking for anyone else other than my partner, rn. I would still love to hang out tho."" Me: ""I'm not talking about a relationship, I just want to be friends. I was just afraid that all the compliments would indicate that. I'd rather not receive compliments or touching, other than a hug when greeting or saying goodbye."" And he said, ""It's okay for me, lol. I'm definitely into friendship. I'm just nice."" This didn't convince my girlfriend, because she said it was just a my point I wanted to make in a fight to get her to let me meet with him. She was right again.  She said she couldn't keep this up because she love me, but when I went into this mode, she feel uncomfortable, afraid of what I would say after our next meetings, and jealous. I started crying, wanting to punish myself, so I ran into the kitchen, blocked the door, and was about to cut myself with a knife. My girlfriend ran in terrified and started calming me down. I cried again, feeling like I wanted to die. I said that if I were her, I would have already broken up with me and that I simply wanted someone who would be like the loving father I missed as a child. But I don't want that to happen. I don't want to hurt my girlfriend. I want a friendship where I can be happy, but without hurting anyone. I know I'm awful and weird, so please don't comment on this.

1njmeye,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1njmeye/tales_from_the_van1_the_pigs/,Tales From The Van#1 The Pigs,"I hate small talk. 
I can do it well enough and even hold a conversation with someone about whatever but I can't stand the idle chit-chat that people will sometimes fall into while sharing a space with someone. 
I used to talk a lot when I was younger but life experiences and my parents taught me that silence says a lot more than it doesn't. Not everyone is comfortable in this quiet. This goes especially for trades folk and construction crews. 
During my younger years I worked for a number of smaller companies that did a lot of out of state work. The long drives coupled with the 2 to 4 seater vans meant I was spending some time enclosed with strangers. 
These people came from all walks of life from an ex fighter jet pilot to some orphaned 17 year old kid trying to go out on his own. 
Not everyone was a talker, most generally gave short and polite responses. Sometimes is I'll get a van buddy with a lot to say and doesn't mind listening to themselves talk for hours. These stories in some way or another stuck with me. So I'll tell them.  
I’ve changed the names, and I don’t know that any of this stuff actually happened or anything.  They’re just stories that stuck with me.

The Pigs 
 
Robert was an electrician I spent a year or two under as an apprentice. Didn't do any good to be honest because i don't even work in that field, but hey its experience on my belt, and honestly Rob was easy to hang around. Didn't say too much maybe on account of his English being heavily accented and when he did speak he liked to throw in some Spanish sometimes. A real nice guy too. He'd offer parts of his lunch to me when I couldn't be bothered or I forgot to bring my own. 
We often wired up farm houses and animal pens like overhead lighting for chicken coops or cow pens. It was easy work and we became nose blind to the more ferocious odors that the animals left behind. One animal that Robert absolutely hated to be around were pigs. 
He'd get all jumpy and irritated around them. Wouldn't touch or pet any of them and honestly it looked like he was doing his best to avoid their dull eyed gazes.
 We were on a farm one summer hooking up some flood lights on the pig pens and he basically jumped off a 5 foot ladder because one of the pigs in the pens beside him gave out a squeal. I could see his frustration and he even started to look pale so I offered to finish up the lighting while he took a break in the van. 

After I finished up I found him in the van. He was breathing heavily and sweating way more than usual. I was his driver so luckily his condition wouldn't stop us from getting home but I'll admit I was curious. I refrained from asking about it. I just got behind the wheel and started looking up the next address on my phone when he spoke up. His voice was hoarse. 
“Can we please go man”  i was trying to spell the address when i answered back  “yeah brother just give me a sec-”
“NO- here let me” he took my phone and the clipboard and started typing away. I wasn't too interested in sticking around anyway since pigs gave off a particularly bad odor so I threw it in drive and started off the driveway. He gave the phone back once we're back on the road. 
“Sorry my friend, I don't like them.” he said 
“Nah, it's fine man. Hopefully the next one will be horses or some shit.” I joked. He took awhile to settle back down. We had a long drive ahead of us and he seemed pensive, constantly catching my eyes when I looked at my right hand mirror. He always looked like I had just caught him doing something. It was a minute before he spoke again. 
“Hijo , how old are you?” 
I think at the time I was 17-18. I answered in kind. “Are you lantino?” He asked. I told him about my roots, my father being Central American and how we had spent some time in the countryside with my grandmother who lives there. He chuckled at that 
“Back in my day in the country just below your dads it was very bad my friend. Your gringo army killed my country's president and there was fighting. Guerilla fighters, what you would call  rebels, took to the streets with guns and bombs oh my god” he mimics the sound of gunfire and explosions “Our military was working with you gringos trying to stop the Guerillas but many people were upset with the new presidents. So many people came to be rebels. At the time the military were killing anyone they thought were rebels. My older hermano  died that way. He was out late and they…” he trails off and sighs.
 “Well we never saw him again. We only knew because he was with friends at the time. I was a young kid. Younger than you maybe by 2 years. Mi familia worked on plantations. Fruits and shit. That meant for more than half the day I was by myself. That didn't mean I didn't have anything to do though my parents left me a list everyday of things that needed to be done before they got back. Cleaning floors, dusting, cutting vegetables and meat for the food they'd make that night but usually I would also go to the flea market. In my day there was no Walmart or whatever you got whatever the people in your area were selling. Peppers, candies and meats were usually what'd you get. The path to the market started basically at the foot of our little casa so we'll always see people walking by with boxes or carts. It was a 15 minute walk and it led right beside the cages for the animals they killed for the meat.”
He drew an imaginary map with his hands in the air as he spoke. I didn't pay much attention to it because I had my eyes on the road. 
“My friend the pigs we have are very different from gringo pigs” he makes a pained face like someone just grabbed his sack and was hanging by it. He points to the face and continues “Big, ugly, hairy mean mother fuckers. I've seen them strip a dead pig carcass to nothing but scraps in 15 minutes. Loud too, so loud you could hear them from when you're coming up the road. They know you're there because they smell your blood” 
i give a questioning look 
“Yes really they bite at the farmers feets and the taste makes them crazy so can't be around them by yourself or theyll bite the skin right off the back of your legs. I hated them, my friend. They always squealed like ‘REEEEEEEEEE’” 
He makes a loud screeching, sucking noise and snorts like a pig. 
“They knew I was scared. They could smell it and it made them hungry” he shivers. “Id always run past like a little chica(girl). Their eyes would not leave my every movement, but they were in cages so it was ok. I saw them a lot because it was the only way to the market.” 
He goes on about the market. He explains how many of them were neighbors and knew him since before he could walk. His usual shops even had already portioned cuts of steak or vegetables already wrapped for him. He seemed calmer than before, less anxious but as he's going through each store occupants life story he stopped suddenly and sighed. The abrupt mood shift lifted my usually distanced disposition. He was just fine,wasn't he?
“Hey buddy you alright?” I asked. I looked over at him. He had his gaze fixed on the horizon out his passenger window. I couldn't chance longer than a few seconds' glances because I was behind the wheel but I swear I could see the beginnings of tears in his eyes. 

“She was a little old abuelita. She sold uuh..i guess what you would call coffee cakes? We just call them conchas. They were delicious. Little breads with sugar or chocolate on top like candy. She sold them by herself on the road because her son ran off to fight, left her. She made the journey all the way from her house up in the hills.”
He makes the sign of the cross here and ends with his hands in prayer for a brief moment.  
“She sat there all day. I brought what I could with the change I had left. She would always say ‘Muchas gracias hijo, Dios te bendiga.’”
He starts sniffing like he's crying here but I never see any tears . 
“Such a sweet lady. One day I go to the market just to buy her cakes. It was my birthday ya know and all I wanted was a bag of her conchas. I was too excited, i didn't see the big green truck parked by the road near the market. This big fat bastard this burro in uniform  gets out of the truck and starts yelling at me 
‘hey what you want where you goin’” he makes his accent thicker as he speaks 
“I tell him it's my birthday and I'm going to buy shit, what's it to you fatty?”
 He shook his head 
“Oy my mouth at the time,i guess I deserved what i got next because the pinche perro back handed me. Hard.” 
He whistles like something falling.
 “I was out my friend. Not all the way but I wasn't going anywhere. The fat bastard took my money and left. I guess I was lucky he could have shot me dead but i don't know.. maybe because i told him it was my birthday he decided it was his gift to me. I stayed there for hours and my head was swimming. I didn't even hear the gunshots or the trucks leaving. I knew they did because when I finally got up, that's what I saw. Bullet holes and tire tracks leading from the shacks and shops. They were all empty. Some were on fire and falling apart and it left this smoke and fog all over the place. I could barely see anything but I kept walking through because my head was pounding and I needed help. I wish i just turned around and went home.” 
He sighs again 
“I could hear them all around me. The pigs. I guess one of the militia blew up the gate or just let them out to be a fucker I don't know, but i was bleeding and i was sure they could smell it. They howled like dogs. I could hear them fighting and running, snorting and honking like some demon in the fog. I tried walking slowly so they wouldn't know I was there but any second I could feel their teeth bite into my leg and drag me away. I waited, my friend, waited for half an hour but not one pig. Nothing came for me in the fog but I could hear them close by. But I could also hear something else.” 
He drops his voice to a low husky rasp. I could barely hear it over the vans engine 
“I thought it was one of them… it was a tiny small noise. Like someone frail or a small animal. The more I listened, the more words I heard.”
‘Someone… please.. my son .. help me…please..’ 
We sat in silence for a minute. I refrained from asking questions. 

“I didn't know what to do.  I just ran. Ran all the way home. I didn't stop or slow down or even breathe until I got to my home. All I remember after that is my dad pulling me out from under the bed and smacking my ass because I wouldn't stop crying long enough to tell him what happened.” He chuckles here 
‘Why are you crying like a girl huh?’ He would say ‘quit being a chica’ After i told him he had a talk with my mother and from then” 
He claps his hands and whistles 
“I went with them to the fields. Back then they could do that you know? I spent so many hot days there. They never let me go back to the market. I never learned what happened but I knew.” 
He sits up and points at me 
“Thats why I don't like them my friend. They're evil”

My partner of 5 years F(33) asked if it's okay if her friends brother M(27) can come stay at our house for a month. We have a 4 bedroom house and he did stay with us previously for a couple of weeks but since then we have a lodger so the guy would have to stay in the only spare room which I do like to use but I didn't want to put my partner in a position where she had to say no. So I explained I don't really want the guy to come as it's not ideal now as we have a lodger etc but reluctantly agreed. 

So he's arrived, we met him in town and I helped him with his luggage and paid for a cab home where I had prepared food especially for his arrival and made sure he felt welcomed and fed him. 

Over the next few days I'm doing the same, coming home from work, preparing food for us all, cooking etc. going out of my way to make him comfortable. He doesn't work but searching for a job so home all day. I am getting a little annoyed a few days in as the kitchen was a mess. I've worked all day, come home and have to clean all the mess from the night before before making everyone else the next meal. 

My partner works hard and is under lots of stress and she does help. I do the majority of shopping, cooking, cleaning, washing clothes and making sure the house is kept clean while working full-time too and I have lots of stress to but honestly I like to look after her and make sure the house is kept well. 

I mentioned to the guest that I've been and done a hard day's work, come home to lots of mess and spent a couple hours making everything nice and tidy, he says oh...makes a coffee and leaves another mess for me to clean. Total disrespect in my opinion. 

I brought it up with my partner and explained this guy I welcomed with open arms, fed and cleaned after him is just taking the piss out of me and us. She said yes he could do more to help while we're out working all day but she's under enough stress and I'm causing issues. I brought it up again and then apparently I'm just bitching about him. 

We have now fell out me and the Mrs, I've spent a week in the sofa while the guest has a king-size bed in my spare room. My choice I just need to be alone and upset that for all I do I'm the one with the problem. The guy is a grown man I just can't believe someone would move into somebody's home for free and take the piss like this. 

What other man would allow another guy to move into his house who's closer to their partner's age than me, buy and cook lovely food for them, clean up after them and be cordial, welcoming and supportive after he just doesn't give anything back.? 

It's shocking to me and I really don't think I'm in the wrong but made to feel like I am.

- Start with an open‑ended question that references something from the other person’s profile, such as asking about a pet shown in photos, to show genuine curiosity.
- Keep the tone light and playful; use emojis and GIFs sparingly, and avoid overly suggestive symbols like the eggplant emoji when a subtle hint is intended.
- Stay authentic rather than relying on AI‑generated messages; preserve your own voice to avoid creating a false persona.
- When the chat gains momentum, signal a desire to meet in person with a direct but low‑pressure invitation, for example, suggesting coffee.
- Respect privacy and consent when sharing intimate images; obtain clear permission and use secure, password‑protected storage.

Why it matters: Effective digital flirting can sustain engagement, build trust, and smooth the transition from online chat to face‑to‑face connection.

1njmbaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1njmbaw/why_are_hefty_ultra_strong_trash_bags_a_game/,Why Are Hefty Ultra Strong Trash Bags a Game Changer for Kitchens,"Testing out the Hefty Ultra Strong 13 Gallon Trash Bags, I wasn’t expecting to feel so enthusiastic about garbage bags, but here we are. These hefty black trash bags have a solid reputation, and as someone who’s constantly on trash duty at home, I decided to see if they live up to the hype. Spoiler alert: they mostly do, but there are a few quirks that are worth pointing out. Let me break down the experience with these black kitchen bags in detail.

**Toughness That Stands Out**  
On the durability front, these bags deliver big time. With their triple-action technology, I found they stretch and expand like champions, accommodating even the awkwardly shaped garbage bits I tossed in. During one particularly hectic weekend, I packed one of these bags ridiculously full with sharp-edged takeout boxes and empty soda cans. Not a single puncture or tear in sight—it’s like the bag was taunting me, ""Is that all you’ve got?"" The break-resistant drawstrings were also a pleasant surprise, holding everything together without that annoying slip that often leads to spills.

**Odor Control That Actually Works**  
Garbage tends to stink; that's just the law of nature. However, the Clean Burst scent combined with the Arm & Hammer odor-neutralizer built into these bags made taking out the trash a surprisingly fresh-smelling task. Even after loading them with leftover chicken from last night’s dinner (yep, the big kitchen sin of not dumping it immediately), the bag somehow masked the normally revolting odor. If kitchen funk is a problem in your home, this is a major win.

**Designed for Blackout**  
The bags’ black-out design isn’t just for aesthetics—it’s practical too. In testing them side by side with regular white kitchen bags, it was clear the Hefty bags outperformed when it came to masking less-than-pleasant sights. Overflowing trash? Fruit peels? Spilled coffee grounds? All hidden from sight. Whether you’re hosting a get-together or just trying to keep your kitchen pristine, this feature adds a surprising layer of utility.

**Key Benefits**  
- Durability that handles heavy loads without tearing or leaking  
- Strong drawstring enclosure, preventing messy spills  
- Effective odor control using Arm & Hammer technology  
- Blackout design conceals unsightly garbage  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The Clean Burst scent, while nice, can be overly strong for sensitive noses  
- They aren’t the most eco-friendly option out there—for those aiming for zero-waste living, the heavy-duty plastic might be a downside  

**Other Options**  
Compared to alternatives, these trash bags bring some distinct perks. Glad's ForceFlex bags, for instance, offer similar durability, but their scent isn’t as potent, which might appeal to folks sensitive to strong smells. On the other hand, eco-conscious brands like Seventh Generation have biodegradable options, though those bags aren’t nearly as tough as the Hefty ones. If durability and odor control are high on your must-haves, these bags have a leg up on most of the competition.

**Cost Efficiency**  
They hit a sweet spot when it comes to price versus performance. While these aren’t the cheapest trash bags, the added features—odor control, durable material, and blackout functionality—justify spending a bit more. It feels like getting premium garbage handling without venturing into absurd levels of spending.

I’ve always avoided tubeliners since nothing ever happens. Why do you all in this sub (ok vast majority) fly tube liners? It’s boring as hell! Most excitement to be had is if the sim crashes on your crosswind final — which isn’t very exciting to begin with — or you accidentally bound the wrong key command and now the pushback tug has yeeted you into the terminal building.

Is it really that fun to stare at the magenta line for 9 hours while occasionally adjusting the seatbelt sign? “Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking, I will now… sit here and monitor the coffee machine status until TOD.”

I mean, every screenshot is the same: “Here’s my A320 at FL360, here’s my 737 at FL360, here’s my 777 at FL360…” Congrats, you’ve discovered Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V but with different paint jobs.

Meanwhile the “realistic immersion” seems to be:

Loading up the sim, programming a 400-line FMC flight plan, then spending 3 hours watching Netflix while your autopilot does all the work.

Panicking because ATC told you to descend 500 ft earlier than your holy SimBrief plan.

Spending 40 minutes setting up your cockpit just to… taxi in a straight line.

Where’s the fun stuff? No one flies bush planes with cargo out of Papua New Guinea? No glider races or cross country flying over the Alps with other players?

I even flew a real 737 and an A320 simulator once. It was fun until the takeoff and landing were done…

Hi everyone,

This is my first time posting something like this, so I’m not totally sure how to start, but the easiest way is probably to share a bit about myself and why I’m here.

I moved to the Netherlands about 6 years ago to study computer science. In my last year I met my girlfriend (we’re still together), and around the same time I started working. Fast forward 3 years since graduating… and I’ve realized I’m actually pretty lonely.

Most of my close friends from uni moved away after graduation, and I didn’t help the situation much. I poured most of my time into work and my relationship, which sped up losing touch. I regret that now, but instead of beating myself up, I’m trying to fix it, so here I am.

I’d describe myself as pretty extroverted and very chatty once I’m comfortable. Initially I can shut down and get shy, which makes it harder to connect, but I’m aware of it and working on it.

A little about me:

* Love biking and long walks around the city
* Big fan of movies/shows, coffee, and cooking 
* Used to be really into building mechanical keyboards
* I enjoy board games a lot (maybe we could check out a board game night online or in person someday?)
* Don’t game as much anymore, but I used to play a lot of Overwatch, Battlefield, Titanfall, and I still keep up with gaming news
* I have a dark sense of humor and really enjoy watching stand-up comedy
* I love travelling, and one of my goals is to do the Eibsee loop in Germany, turns out getting there is a bit trickier than I thought
* I’m a sucker for passion: if you’re wildly into something, your enthusiasm is contagious. Even if I’m not into it at first, I usually end up getting hooked

And so much more, this list is just what I could think of on the train to work. If your hobbies/interests don’t exactly align, don’t worry, I’m open to trying and exploring new stuff 

# So yeah, whether you’re nearby in the Netherlands or halfway across the world, I’d love to make some new connections. 

An easy icebreaker: tell me something you’re really passionate about so we can dive into it or, if you prefer, a dark joke is always welcome. Always happy to chat online, and who knows, maybe even meet up someday if life lines up that way!",1,1758136001.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.67,False

I can make you coffee before work. I’ll give you massages after you’ve had a long day. I know you probably don’t think of me as the domestic type but for you I will keep your house clean and occasionally cook your favorite meals (though I’ll mostly DoorDash tbh) 

I’ll make sure that you’re always satisfied, ready to go whenever you want me. I’ll make you feel like a man I promise!

We can go on fun adventures together, explore the unknown during the day then spend the evenings cuddled up in each other’s arms basking in the warmth of one another’s love! 

We’ll share inside jokes and stolen glances. We can be best friends on a permanent sleep over. 

When life gets hard you can come to me with all of your problems and feel safe knowing that I’d never judge you. You can be as vulnerable as you want or just hold me silently and say nothing as I stroke your hair and give you forehead kisses.

I’m a young man from Vadodara who enjoys meaningful connections—whether that’s deep conversations, laughter over coffee, or moments of pure intimacy that happen when two people truly vibe.

For me, attraction is about energy and consent—two people choosing to enjoy each other’s company, freely and without judgment. I don’t see anything wrong with women embracing their desires; in fact, I admire it. Confidence and openness are incredibly attractive.

I’m here to share experiences that feel natural, exciting, and unforgettable. No labels, no pressure—just honesty, respect, and a spark that makes both of us feel alive. 

Life is too short to hold back from experiences that bring joy and connection. In today’s world, companionship is not about labels—it’s about two people choosing to share moments, laughter, and passion with mutual respect and consent.

In Vadodara and across Gujarat, the youth are embracing openness and self-expression. For women, there’s nothing wrong in seeking companionship that makes them feel alive, confident, and desired. When both sides agree, these connections become celebrations of freedom, energy, and the beauty of being young and satisfied.

Whether it’s enjoying a deep conversation, exploring the city, or sharing private, intimate moments, what matters most is honesty and consent. It’s not about right or wrong—it’s about living life fully, without guilt, and respecting the choices that empower us. 

So feel free to connect with me on private chat and start an amazing journey of sexy vibes!!! ",0,1758135969.0,vadodara,9,0.3,False

1njm35p,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1njm35p/aita_for_testing_my_husband_with_a_fake_dating/,"AITA for ""testing"" my husband with a fake dating profile and then having an actual affair?","My sister convinced me my husband was taking me for granted, so I decided to test him by creating a fake online dating profile.

I know how that sounds. Trust me, I know. But after three glasses of wine and my sister going on about how my husband never complimented me anymore, never took me on dates, how I was basically just his live-in maid and babysitter, something in me snapped. She kept saying things like ""you deserve to feel wanted"" and ""men only appreciate what they think they might lose.""

So I made the profile. Just to see if anyone would even be interested in me. I'm 38, mother of two teenagers, haven't been to the gym in years. I figured I'd get zero matches and that would be that.

But I got matches. Lots of them. And this one guy, he messaged me right away. Not with some crude pickup line but actual conversation. He asked about the book I was reading in my profile picture. We started talking about authors we liked, movies, stupid everyday stuff.

I told myself it was harmless. Just chatting. My husband barely looked up from his phone when I talked anyway.

The guy asked to meet for coffee. I said no at first. But my sister kept pushing. ""Just go see what it's like to have someone actually interested in you again,"" she said. ""You don't have to do anything. Just remember what it feels like.""

So I went.

And god help me, I felt alive again. He laughed at my jokes. He asked follow-up questions when I talked about my day. He remembered things I'd mentioned in our messages. When was the last time my husband had done any of that?

Coffee turned into lunch the next week. Lunch turned into him kissing me in the parking lot. And I kissed him back.

I wish I could say I felt guilty right away. I didn't. I felt wanted. I felt exciting. I felt like more than just someone's mother and wife.

The affair lasted two months. I was careful. Or I thought I was. Deleted messages, cleared my browser history, had alibis ready. My sister even covered for me a few times.

Then one Tuesday morning, my husband set a manila folder on the kitchen counter while I was making breakfast.

""What's this?"" I asked.

""Divorce papers,"" he said. His voice was so calm it scared me. ""And screenshots of every message you sent him. Every hotel receipt. Even the Uber records from when you told me you were at your sister's.""

My legs went numb. ""How did you...""

""Your sister,"" he said. ""She felt guilty. Told me everything last week.""

The same sister who pushed me into this. Who said I deserved better. Who covered for me. She'd been recording our conversations, screenshotting my texts about the affair. Building a case for my husband.

""The kids know,"" he continued. ""I didn't tell them details, just that you had an affair. They're old enough to understand what that means.""

My daughter was 16. My son was 14. Old enough to hate me.

""I've already filed for primary custody,"" he said. ""The lawyer says with the evidence I have, plus your sister's testimony, I'll likely get it. The kids want to stay with me anyway.""

I tried to explain. Tried to tell him how lonely I'd been, how unappreciated I'd felt. He just looked at me like I was a stranger.

""I worked sixty hours a week to pay for this house,"" he said. ""I coached our son's baseball team. I never missed a single school event. I'm sorry I didn't tell you you're beautiful every day. I'm sorry I was tired. But I never cheated on you. Not once in eighteen years.""

The divorce was final in four months. The kids chose to live with him. The judge gave me every other weekend, but they usually had ""plans"" when my time came around.

I kept seeing the other guy for a while. But once the excitement of sneaking around was gone, once it was just us in my empty apartment, we had nothing. He didn't want to hear about my divorce drama. Didn't want to deal with my kids rejecting me. He'd liked the fun, married woman looking for excitement. Not the divorced single mom with baggage.

My sister tried to apologize once. Showed up at my apartment with wine, like old times. Said she felt terrible about everything, but that she couldn't watch me throw my life away. That she thought if my husband knew, he'd fight for me, realize what he was losing.

I threw the wine bottle at the wall. Haven't talked to her since.

It's been six months now. My son answered my call last week, but only to tell me he made varsity basketball. The conversation lasted two minutes. My daughter posts family photos on Instagram. Her dad. Her brother. Their new dog. I'm never in them.

I see my husband sometimes when I pick up the kids for my weekend. He looks good. Lighter somehow. He joined a gym, started playing guitar again. Things he'd talked about doing for years but never had time for. Probably because he was too busy working to support his ungrateful wife.

My therapist says I need to forgive myself. That everyone makes mistakes. But how do you forgive yourself when your kids won't even look at you? When you destroyed your family because you were bored?

I guess what I'm asking is, AITA for trying to save my marriage but losing everything instead?

Basamala's hands shook as she looked at her investment account. Everything was green—profits everywhere. Her tech stocks were up, her bonds paid steady returns, and her savings account earned interest every month. On paper, she was winning.

But something felt wrong. Ever since her pilgrimage to Mecca, a quiet voice in her heart had grown louder with each passing day.

The breaking point came on a rainy Thursday night. She was checking her investment app when a notification popped up: dividend payment from a tobacco company. She'd forgotten she even owned shares through one of her funds. The amount was tiny—$47.23—but it hit her like a punch to the stomach.

""Where is my money actually going?"" she whispered to herself, feeling the weight of this realization.

# Looking for Answers

Three sleepless nights later, Basamala sat across from Marcus, her financial advisor. The office felt stuffy as she tried to explain what was bothering her.

""I need to understand something,"" she said. ""This portfolio you built for me—where exactly is my money going?""

Marcus pulled up her account on his computer. ""Well, you have some S&P 500 funds, international bonds, a few sector ETFs—""

""But what actual companies? What do they do?""

He paused, maybe sensing something urgent in her voice. ""Basamala, your returns have been great. Why change a winning strategy?""

The question stuck with her. Why indeed? Because making money without caring how felt empty. Because she realized that building wealth the wrong way could damage more than just her bank account—it could damage her soul.

# A New Path Opens

That weekend, Basamala spent hours researching online. She dug deep into her investments and didn't like what she found. Her money was quietly supporting alcohol companies, gambling websites, and weapons manufacturers—industries that went against everything she believed in.

It hurt to learn this. But it also opened a door she didn't know existed: halal investing.

""Asset-based investments,"" she read from her laptop. ""Money should never be the subject of investment itself.""

This wasn't just about avoiding certain companies. It was about completely changing how wealth should be created—through real value, not through playing games with money itself.

# Understanding Real Ownership

Basamala's journey into halal investing started with one simple question: ""What am I actually buying?""

She learned that when she bought stock in a tech company that made useful software, she wasn't just gambling on stock prices. She was becoming a part owner of something that helped real people. The company hired workers, created solutions, and provided genuine value. Her profits would come from the company's success, not from guaranteed interest payments that ignored whether the company was doing well or poorly.

This was so different from her old way of thinking. Regular bonds promised her fixed returns whether the borrowing company succeeded or failed. But halal investing meant sharing both the ups and downs with the businesses she supported. If they did well through honest work, she would do well. If they struggled, she would struggle with them.

This felt more honest, more real.

# Learning to Choose Wisely

Checking potential investments became Basamala's Sunday morning routine. She would sit with her coffee and carefully research each opportunity. She created her own simple checklist:

*What does this company actually make or do?* *Do their products help people or take advantage of them?* *How much money do they make from interest-based activities?* *Are they buried in debt, or do they run a solid business?*

She discovered the 5% rule—companies could still be okay if less than 5% of their money came from forbidden sources. This wasn't permission to invest in bad companies, but a practical way to deal with the fact that in today's world, finding perfectly clean businesses was nearly impossible.

The research took time, but it felt important. Each decision mattered.

# Making the Big Changes

Changing her entire investment portfolio felt like major surgery. Basamala sold all her bonds, got rid of her bank stocks, and dropped anything connected to alcohol, gambling, or other industries she wanted to avoid. Each sale was a small step toward aligning her money with her beliefs.

It wasn't easy. She realized that halal investing sometimes meant fewer options and missing out on profitable sectors that were off-limits. There were moments when she wondered if she was making a mistake, especially when her old tobacco stock kept going up without her.

But something amazing happened as she built her new portfolio: she felt more connected to her investments than ever before. When she bought shares in a solar company, she wasn't just hoping to make money—she was supporting clean energy. When she invested in a medical company working on rare diseases, she was funding hope for patients who desperately needed it.

Her money now had meaning beyond just making more money.

# The Awakening

Six months into her halal investing journey, Basmala noticed changes beyond her portfolio. She had become a more conscious consumer, asking deeper questions about the companies she patronized with her daily spending. She started paying zakat on her investments—not because she was required to, but because the practice of giving 2.5% of her eligible wealth annually connected her prosperity to the welfare of her community.

The most profound shift was in how she viewed money itself. Previously, wealth had been an abstract number on a screen, something to be maximized through clever financial engineering. Now, every dollar represented a choice about the kind of world she wanted to help create.

# The Challenge

Of course, the path wasn't without obstacles. Basmala discovered that finding truly halal investments required constant vigilance. Companies could change their business models, take on excessive debt, or enter forbidden industries. The screening process was ongoing, demanding both time and knowledge she was still developing.

She also faced practical limitations. Islamic financial instruments like sukuk were less liquid than conventional bonds. Real estate investment trusts that met her criteria were fewer in number. The universe of halal options, while growing, remained smaller than the vast ocean of conventional investments.

But these constraints, Basmala realized, weren't bugs in the system—they were features. They forced her to be more thoughtful, more patient, more committed to long-term value creation rather than short-term speculation.

# The Community

As Basmala deepened her understanding of halal investing, she discovered she wasn't alone. A growing community of ethical investors was asking the same questions, facing the same challenges, and celebrating the same victories.

She joined online forums where investors shared research, debated the compliance of specific stocks, and supported each other through the complexities of faith-based finance. She learned about profit-sharing arrangements, asset-backed investments, and the subtle art of purifying investment returns by donating impermissible portions to charity.

Through these connections, Basmala began to see halal investing not as a restriction, but as part of a broader movement toward more conscious capitalism—one that valued social benefit alongside financial return.

# The Legacy

One year later, Basmala’'s portfolio told a different story than the one she'd started with. Her returns were competitive, though they came with occasional volatility she hadn't experienced in her bond-heavy past. More importantly, every position represented a conscious choice aligned with her values.

She had learned to invest not just her money, but her attention and intention. Each quarterly report wasn't just a measure of financial performance, but a window into whether her capital was contributing to the kind of world she wanted to live in.

As she reviewed her holdings one evening—shares in clean energy companies, sustainable agriculture ventures, and technology firms creating genuine solutions—Basmala felt something she'd never experienced with her old portfolio: pride. Not just in the returns, but in the journey itself.

The path to halal wealth, she had discovered, wasn't about finding perfect investments in an imperfect world. It was about making increasingly conscious choices, accepting both the financial and spiritual responsibilities of ownership, and understanding that true prosperity couldn't be separated from the wellbeing of the community that made it possible.

Her money was no longer just working for her—it was working for the world she wanted to help build. And in that alignment, she had found something more valuable than compound interest: compound purpose.

The end of the world didn’t come the way anyone thought it would.

None of the world’s religions, with all their sacred texts and solemn warnings, could have predicted how quiet the day of judgment would be.

How oddly pale the two men who knocked on everyone's door will be, dressed in pitch black suits that didn’t quite fit, the way the fabric sagged at the shoulders, in the way their collars seemed too tightly wrapped around their necks. 

Handsome in an uncanny way, pale line of lips permanently crooked into a smile above soft rounded chin.

Every polite question seemed to slide off them. No matter how many times you asked if they wanted something to drink, the answer was always the same. A slow, synchronized shake of the head.

And when they finally spoke, it was like listening to a radio station drifting in and out of static. 

Like if talking was tiering to them, one word eelry quiet the other loud and clear. 

But it was always the same question, like if they only knew this combination of words in English. 



“Are you ready to enter Heaven?”



If you said yes, one of them would reach into the breast pocket of their suit, and pull out a golden square of card that mostly resembled a business card. Though it had no writing. 

Just the golden shine. 

It would slide across the coffee table in your direction. 

Then both of them would walk away.

Or at least, it looked like they walked away. 

Nobody ever saw them actually leave the building.

Soon enough, the cards would be forgotten, blending into the clutter of daily life. Lost among credit cards, wedged between sofa cushions, overlooked and ignored.

And then, without a fail, the white moving van would appear. 

Plain, boxy, its license plates blank. 

The same men would climb out and begin carrying heavy gray boxes into the building. One by one, they brought them back to the van, packing them in as though the space inside was infinite. 

No matter how many loads they hauled, the truck never filled.

Then the doors slammed shut. 

The engine came back to life. 

And their were gone.

I’ve tried knocking on my neighbors’ doors since then, but no one answers.

The streets are empty, too. 

And the silence is becoming unbearable.

1njlvgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HONEST-TENERIFE/comments/1njlvgp/best_time_to_visit_tenerife_weather_prices_crowds/,"Best Time to Visit Tenerife (Weather, Prices, Crowds Month by Month)","Tenerife is one of the few European destinations where sunshine is almost guaranteed year-round. But not all months feel the same. Weather, prices, and crowds shift a lot, and that can really change your trip. This guide keeps it simple: when to go, what to expect, and how north and south differ.

**Tenerife Weather & Crowds by Month**

* **January–February:** Mild temps (N 17°C / S 20°C), some rain in the north. South is sunny and busy with winter escapees. Carnival season = big crowds and higher prices.
* **March–April:** Warming up (N 18–19°C / S 21–22°C). Balanced weather, good for hiking. Prices calmer than winter, moderate crowds.
* **May–June:** Sunny and dry (N 20–22°C / S 24–26°C). Sea is warming, fewer crowds, and moderate prices. Great value months.
* **July–August:** Hot (N 24–25°C / S 28°C). Peak season, beaches full, higher costs in the south. The north is greener but cloudier.
* **September–October:** Warm sea (N 23–21°C / S 26–24°C). Fewer tourists, softer prices, and golden sunsets. One of the best periods overall.
* **November–December:** Mild again (N 19–17°C / S 22–20°C). South stays sunny, north is cloudier. Busier and pricier around Christmas and New Year.

**By Season**

* **Spring (Mar–May):** Balanced weather, clear skies, mild sea. Good for hiking and exploring. Prices moderate.
* **Summer (Jun–Aug):** Hot and dry in the south, peak tourism. South is more expensive, north stays more affordable but cloudier.
* **Autumn (Sep–Nov):** Warm sea, fewer crowds, softer prices. Perfect for slow travel, sunsets, and lower costs.
* **Winter (Dec–Feb):** Mild in the south, cooler in the north. Popular for escaping cold Europe, so holiday weeks = higher prices.

**North vs. South Tenerife**

* **South:** Built for comfort and tourism. More sun, higher resort prices, international menus, and everything close by. Expect €120–400 per night for mid-range hotels, cocktails €7–10, coffee €2.50–3.
* **North:** Local, authentic, and cheaper. More clouds, cooler temps, but charming towns and markets. Expect €40–100 per night in simple places, menu del día for €10–15, coffee €1–1.50.

Transport and activities cost roughly the same island-wide. Car rentals rise in high season, buses are affordable year-round, and most hikes, beaches, and natural pools are free.

**Best Time Overall**  
If you want reliable weather and balanced prices, **April to October** is ideal. For the sweet spot: **April–June** or **September–early November**.

**Final Thoughts**  
North vs. south is the real price divide: the north is local, authentic, and cheaper, while the south is sunnier, busier, and more expensive. Either way, Tenerife can fit different budgets — from €400/week in the north to luxury stays over €4,000/week in the south.

I’m starting anastrazole today so that would add other symptoms too but I at least want to have some decent food here n there. I was avoiding Zofran due to constipation but I have no choice anymore.

This update won’t shake the foundations of humanity, but it does bring a few goodies. The Requested Stations category just got fresh additions, and our French users can finally rejoice, one of the most popular stations (and its sub-stations) has crawled back into Non Stop Radio. Vive la baguette.

I also fixed a handful of broken stations (sorry, I can’t fix *all* of them overnight, unless I suddenly acquire 17 extra arms). Thanks to everyone who reported them through the new in-app feature, you’re keeping the app alive while I’m just here duct-taping streams together.

And yes, more requested stations are now in. You ask, I (eventually) deliver.

Big thanks to everyone who dropped a 5-star review on Google Play. You’re the real MVPs, and possibly the only reason my coffee machine hasn’t filed a labor complaint yet.

The end of the world didn’t come the way anyone thought it would.

None of the world’s religions, with all their sacred texts and solemn warnings, could have predicted how quiet the day of judgment would be.

How oddly pale the two men who knocked on everyone's door will be, dressed in pitch black suits that didn’t quite fit, the way the fabric sagged at the shoulders, in the way their collars seemed too tightly wrapped around their necks. 

Handsome in an uncanny way, pale line of lips permanently crooked into a smile above soft rounded chin.

Every polite question seemed to slide off them. No matter how many times you asked if they wanted something to drink, the answer was always the same. A slow, synchronized shake of the head.

And when they finally spoke, it was like listening to a radio station drifting in and out of static. 

Like if talking was tiering to them, one word eelry quiet the other loud and clear. 

But it was always the same question, like if they only knew this combination of words in English. 



“Are you ready to enter Heaven?”



If you said yes, one of them would reach into the breast pocket of their suit, and pull out a golden square of card that mostly resembled a business card. Though it had no writing. 

Just the golden shine. 

It would slide across the coffee table in your direction. 

Then both of them would walk away.

Or at least, it looked like they walked away. 

Nobody ever saw them actually leave the building.

Soon enough, the cards would be forgotten, blending into the clutter of daily life. Lost among credit cards, wedged between sofa cushions, overlooked and ignored.

And then, without a fail, the white moving van would appear. 

Plain, boxy, its license plates blank. 

The same men would climb out and begin carrying heavy gray boxes into the building. One by one, they brought them back to the van, packing them in as though the space inside was infinite. 

No matter how many loads they hauled, the truck never filled.

Then the doors slammed shut. 

The engine came back to life. 

And their were gone.

I’ve tried knocking on my neighbors’ doors since then, but no one answers.

The streets are empty, too. 

And the silence is becoming unbearable.

Is that really the only ingredients I would need to recreate it besides the espresso/water?

so this morning i got a drink and it tasted absolutely awful and i am not sure how to proceed from here. i got an iced horchata chai latte with a shot of white coffee in it, half sweet. i've had their iced chai once before and it was good, but i'd never tried the horchata chai or white coffee. it tastes and smells like, and i'm not exaggerating here, the barf flavored jelly belly. it's one of the worst things i've ever tasted. i didn't take a sip until i was driving out of the drive thru so i couldn't say anything right then. it literally shocked me so much i automatically teared up a bit because it was so unexpected and bad. i dumped it because there's no way i'm drinking that.

my main question is, what do i do now? does this drink just taste like this for some reason? if not (which i feel like it shouldn't taste like that), do i go back and ask for a refund? or a remake? both? i'm currently at school so i won't be able to go back for several hours, would it be too late or is it fine to go back as long as it's the same day? it hurts to think that i would waste my money on something like this. i'd like to point out i've had nothing but good experiences at my dutch bros in the past, so i don't blame the workers in this, but i feel like i should get something, y'know? i work at starbucks and if this happened where i worked, i would at least give a remake or different drink, but i'd have to ask a shift about specifics. also i ordered it in the drive thru and paid with the app, i'm not sure if they have a log of drinks somehwere for proof that i actually ordered this.

My drink had almond milk so I didn't want the guy to take mine in case he had a nut allergy. I apologized profusely, told him I could pay him back, but he just took it.

I was originally interested in Bubble Bath, looking for a clean, after-shower scent. I was immediately disappointed, as it had a heavy, sweet, milky, coffee shop smell.

I decided that was not for me, so after a few minutes, I went back and tried Coffee Break (thinking, if Bubble Bath smells like that, what could Coffee Break possibly smell like?) To my surprise, it smelled exactly like someone who just stepped out of the shower. A clean, fresh, shampoo smell. Exactly what I was looking for, and I fell in love with it instantly.

Now, I was a bit too shy to interact with the staff and they didn't seem too friendly, so I was too embarrassed to ask if the samples were wrong. I'm pretty sure the bottles had the right names on them. I even sprayed them on paper strips and kept them and they smelled the same the next day. Now I'm not in the US anymore and I can't try them again.

So basically my question is, how likely is it that the bottles were labeled wrong? I'm really interested in buying whatever I smelled on my second attempt, but I can't be sure which one it was now. Does Bubble Bath smell like coffee dessert at all? Does Coffee Break smell clean? My brain says no, but I swear I tried the right bottles.",2,1758134727.0,fragrance,1,1.0,False

The chest is just a temporary coffee table.  No kids just the dogs that rule the roost and sorry they have the pillows a mess right now!  Looking for any help or suggestions on art, sideboard/credenza/under TV storage of some type and coffee table and rug. I don't know proper design formulas and the endless options available are driving me to live like this with an unfinished living room for the foreseeable future. Budget would be anywhere from 3 to 7k for the furnishings and decor.  Would be fine spending under 3k if the look worked.  Everything else in adjoining kitchen is pretty high end or cheaper dupes of high end pieces. Couch was just delivered and one we both liked so I feel it will dictate the other choices but not sure what will work best as far as a light or dark run or light or dark furnishings.

Tapos bakit nagsusulputan ang mga businesses along De Venecia Hiway? Dun sila nagtatambak ng lupa sa dating mga fishponds/fish pens then soon nagkakaroon ng restaurants, coffee shops, etc. 

Naisip ko bakit di na lang sa city mismo? Like the abandoned building sa tapat ng Bedbox hotel, may Hotel Victoria along AB Fernandez or Nable Street ba yon? Ang lawak sa mismong Dagupan City, bakit nagsisiksikan sa De Venecia Hiway? 

Also, bakit di magkaroon ng call center sa Dagupan City? Wala man sa ibang provinces ng Pangasinan, pero sana may malapit na call centers to give more people a chance for work. Kasi marami na kami nakikipagsapalaran sa Baguio, Tarlac, Pampanga, at Manila.

Sorry for the long post, but I need some advice. I’m currently on a weight loss journey. I’m 92 kg, 5’10, male. I’ve lost weight before, but I tend to gain it back, so this time I want to do it right.

Here’s my current routine: I usually wake up around 10 AM, have a banana and coffee, and then head to the gym. My workout lasts about an hour and a half, with 7–8 movements on an upper/lower split (upper, lower, upper, lower), plus 10 minutes on the cross trainer or walking on an incline treadmill. After the gym, I take 2 scoops of MuscleBlaze Biozyme protein, 3g creatine, and some Pintola protein oats. Around 2 PM, I eat lunch which usually consists of 3 chapatis, 1 bowl of rice, vegetables, dal, and salad. In the evening, I snack on puffed rice and fruits (except bananas).

For dinner around 9 PM, I have 200g chicken breast pan-fried with a little oil and veggies, 1 bowl of rice, and 3 egg whites. After that, I go for a 30–40 minute walk, then have a glass of milk before playing video games until about 1–2 AM, and finally go to bed. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, I avoid non-veg, so on those days, my main protein source is whey. I drink around 3–4 liters of water daily.

I started this routine on 27th August. My weight hasn’t really changed since then ,it fluctuates a bit (+1kg or -1kg) but I do feel like my body is changing, which is why I’ve started taking progress pictures.

So my question is - am I on the right track and just need to give it more time, or is there something I’m doing wrong? The last time I lost weight, I didn’t even do much cardio, but this time, despite putting in the work, the scale isn’t moving. Any insights would be super helpful.",1,1758134384.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False

But it changed in one year after an incident with a train crash, causing hundreds of people to get injured. The incident caused an uproar against superheros it took one incident to change the public view of heroes. The government forced superheros into hiding for years.

It's a rainy evening in a cozy bar. The atmosphere is filled with the smell of cheap beer and the sound of jazz. In the back corner of the bar, Jack sits down and orders a coffee, reading the newspaper. He noticed that one of the superheros he knew Macro bust had gone missing. He lives a normal life with a bad job in a car dealership. He changed his identity to Jack Thomson. He drank his coffee paid, walked out and got into his car, and drove home.  When he opened the door.  There was a tablet on the table suddenly. The screen turned on a beautiful woman named Mirage she said, "" Hello Jack Thomson, or should I say Gamma Jack, my name is Mirage, and I have a mission for you call this number 140 457 684 if you except the mission. Jack quickly took the number on a page he would do anything to relive the glory days of superheros, and then the tablet exploded. 

A few days later, he was able to find a way to the mission by taking a private jet. And given the rundown of the mission, it's been a long time since he has worn his superhero suit. The mission was to destroy a robot on an island raking havoc  upon the facilities on the island, and he was dropped onto the island. It was bigger than he imagined running through the thick jungle he was suddenly ambushed by the robot it was bigger than him, and the robot tried to crush his head on a rock, but Jack easily destroyed it by blowing it up and disabling it's mechanical legs. He started to wonder how he was going to get off the island.

 But another robot ambushed him, but this time, it was bigger and stronger than the other one. He tried to destroy it in the same way as the other one. He released a radiation explosion, and the explosion emitted lots of smoke. Jack believed that he destroyed it and started laughing. The robot came out of the smoke undamaged. Jack was shocked he panicked and started to run, but the robot grabbed him by his cape and threw him into a tree, breaking some of his bones, stabbing him in his shoulder, picking him up and throwing him into a rock, and stabbing his chest and now coughing blood. He realized that Mirage set him up to be killed by the robot and with that final thought going through his head. He self destructed, leaving nothing but his lower part of his body with the top missing covering the rock and robots limbs in blood and chunks of body pieces.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

So I’ve been going to therapy to deal with what happened to us, and to me, after Dylan put on the bear costume. The demon-thing I’ve started calling ‘the Fear Suit.’

It's been ten years and I still hear him in the back of my mind. I hear that growling mutter in TV static, in the white-noise hum of the air conditioner.

My therapist says it’ll be helpful to process the trauma if I go back through the posts I made back then, so I can see for myself what I did right and stop focusing on what I did wrong. She says it’ll help me understand that none of this was really my fault, and I can’t blame myself for what the costume did—how many people it killed. The turkey carver incident, the dead cops, none of it was my fault.

Some nights I dream about bears.

The worst one is where I’m a little kid and I’m sitting in my childhood bedroom. In a little white rocking chair right in front of me is a Teddy Ruxpin—if you’re not old enough to remember those, it was a cutesy teddy bear with a tape-player in its back, and it played stories while the mouth moved and the eyes blinked as if the teddy bear were telling you a story.

I look down at my hands. I’m holding a silver statue. It’s a bird. An eagle, maybe? Think it might be a hood ornament. Broken off at the base.

In my dream, the bear’s mouth moves, and the eyes blink, but instead of a fairytale, this demonic growl comes out of this thing: “OUI, OUI, LA FROMAGE! LES ENCOM-PETAWN!” and blood starts spraying out of its animatronic mouth, just *gushing,* vivid red Technicolor Dario Argento blood and thick black clots puddling on the floor around me, soaking into the rug, soaking into my Underoos, and when I look back up, this disgusting Teddy Ruxpin is the size of a full-grown man.

Covered in blood and matted with filth and river-slime, and one of its paws is a blood-stained human hand.

It’s holding a machete.

The mouth moves, and the eyes blink, and this giant demon Teddy Ruxpin giggles—a sound that in its deep demonic voice sounds like a horse—and says in a singsong way, “WAKE ME UP INSIDE. CAN’T WAKE UP,” and I realize that’s because the tape in its back is an Evanescence album.

The bear opens his mouth again and the voice rises higher and higher, turning into a chipmunk scribble of noise, and then he barfs up a wild tangle of black plastic as the tape unspools into my terrified hands.

And then the bear raises the machete—“Dylan” rears back a hand, that grimy red human hand—and swings that machete at my face. As the blade penetrates my skull, I feel cold steel slide through my scalp and cleave deep into the fatty, nerveless white meat of my brain.

That’s what wakes me up. That numb sensation of cold steel, and then the unfeeling *nothing* of the blade in the middle of my brain.

Then I got fuckin’ Evanescence stuck in my head all day, like that blade.

The whole reason I started going to therapy in the first place. Evanescence. Have you ever had a post-traumatic earworm stuck in your head? *I can’t wake up.* It’s a cold machete blade, resting against my hot brain stem, wedged between my hypothalamus and my amygdala. Icy, gleaming steel planted firmly between the smell of my grandmother’s house and the night I lost my virginity. *How can you see into my eyes like open doors?* I’m screaming Christian rock lyrics in a cold sweat, sitting bolt upright in my bed at four in the morning. *Call my name and save me from the dark.*

Please God help me. I can hear him calling to me.

The hivernant. The hunter. The thing with the spiky garden tool. Bloody, in the basement of the infinite church. The insane ghost that killed my friends and tried to kill me.

He’s still out there, isn’t he?

My god. He’s still out there.

  
\--------------------------



This weekend, my town did its annual furry convention, OxFurred.

It’s a medium-sized town in Alabama, so the convention is small. There’s only about five or six hundred people that show up, and most of them trickle in from all over the state. My friends and I—me, Steven, Dylan, Jacob, and Ashleigh—we’ve been going for a few years, ever since there were only about forty people and they were holding the get-together at the mall. Now they run it out of the Marriott in Oxford.

Yes, I’m a furry. Well, I used to be, I guess. Maybe not anymore.

The majority of my friends are too. Let’s go ahead and get that out of the way. Get it out of your system—“Burn in hell, furfags!” and all that, and conveniently forget that we all had a crush on Catwoman back in the day, or Maid Marian from that Robin Hood cartoon with the foxes, or Lola the Rabbit from *Space Jam.*

Most furries aren’t what you think. You know: perverts, sickos. Some are, but the ratio is no more than your average slice of humanity. Every subculture has its wackos.

Last year we gave a ride to a guy from out of town and he showed up in a diaper. I mean, he had clothes on and stuff, and an old cat-ear headband he probably picked up at a dollar store last Halloween. The diaper was under his clothes. Under his blue jeans. We heard it crinkling when he first got in the car, but we thought he just had some cellophane in his pocket, or like a sandwich baggie or something. I actually thought (hoped) it might be pot.

It wasn’t until he shit in the diaper that we realized what was going on (because we could all smell it), and Steven made him get out halfway to town, even though he tried to deny he did it, shouting at the car even as we were pulling out of the gas station parking lot.

Steven is our de facto leader, I guess you could say. Our Leonardo. Unlike the rest of us, he went to college up in Jacksonville and he makes pretty good money now telecommuting, doing IT work for a cloud storage company that deals exclusively with corporations.

Then there was the guy that showed up in an actual fursuit. I’m the only one of us that owns one (it’s really just a set of pajamas called “kigurumi” that my grandmother got me last Christmas because it was still on my Amazon wishlist) but this guy’s was legit—it was one of those fancy commissioned suits, with the recessed glass eyes that follow you around the room, a bespoke torso, and a moving jaw. Bennie was a wolf with green-and-black fur. The face and fur looked realistic, except for the lime green. I hate that goofy-ass rave shit.

The tail was cool, though, it had a whip antenna or something inside it, so it stood up but it was still flexible, so he could wag it. And he was in pretty good shape, so it all really came together well.

But the turning point was the last day of the convention, when Bennie and I were out in the parking lot and he asked me to pull his antenna tail. It had a little give to it, like I was tugging on a boot stuck in deep mud, and when I looked up and saw the expression on his face I realized that it wasn’t part of the fursuit—it was a custom job run through a hole in his costume bottom.

He had been walking around in public, dancing and talking to people for two days, and went to the Sizzler with us that Saturday, sitting at our table, eating a salad with his gloves and head pulled off, and this tailplug stuck up his ass.

So fuck both those nasty motherfuckers. Most of us aren’t like that.



\*    \*    \*     



Last Monday, I think—the week before OxFurred—Ashleigh found this cool realistic fursuit on Craigslist and she said it was super-cheap, like forty bucks.

The guy selling it lived down in Roanoke. She put the pictures on our Facebook group for us to see and…I don’t know, we thought about it. It looked cool, but even though it was relatively cheap, we didn’t have the cash to spare. I mean, I work for peanuts at Books-a-Million. Ashleigh doesn’t work, she lives with her mother. Dylan works at Taco Bell and he’s thinking about joining the Army. (You’d never guess there are a lot of secret furries in the military.)

Steven eventually ponied up for it just because he wanted to embarrass Dylan. Dylan’s “fursona” is a bear, so he would naturally be the one wearing it, because it was a big russet-colored bear fursuit.

He’s the only bear in the group. He’s a red bear, I’m a white gryphon, Steven is a blue dragon (AKA a “scaly”), Jacob is a green horse because he’s got issues, and Ashleigh is a gray fox. None of us were truly fucked up like Bennie Buttplug or the diaper guy. We don’t seriously believe that we are these animals inside, like the “otherkin” people, they’re just, like, “personal mascots,” I guess you could say. I don’t know. You put up with enough mental anguish and you’ll take comfort in just about anything that doesn’t make you feel like shit.

That’s how I see it. Other people have church. We’ve got the cast of *Talespin.*

We went back and forth over the suit all day Tuesday. At first Dylan wanted to refuse—he’s a pretty shy kind of guy even though he’s big. Down here they call guys like him “corn-fed.” He kept telling Steven not to waste his money on the suit, but by Wednesday afternoon, Ashleigh had finally worn him down. He’s got kind of a crush on her. He thinks none of us know, but it’s pretty much common knowledge. I guess he agreed to it to impress her or something? I would think joining the Army would be even more impressive, but whatever.

We emailed the suit guy on Craigslist and he told us to come down to Roanoke the next day to pick it up. We all took Jacob’s 4-Runner down after work.

Roanoke turned out to be some bumpkin-ass hillbilly town way out in the sticks. I don’t recall even seeing anything that you could reliably refer to as a “town”—it was just a two-lane highway through miles and miles of cow pastures and then you started seeing more and more houses until you were already leaving out the other side. They were all sad-looking farmhouses like something out of the Great Depression, forlorn and worn-out. Haunted houses where the ghosts just folded their poker hands, put the chairs up on the tables, and moved away.

Most of them had cars parked outside. Old-people cars like Buicks and stepside Fords. But I don’t recall seeing any people except for a Larry the Cable Guy lookalike on a zero-turn mower cutting the lawn at the park.

We actually drove through the town before we realized we were there. “City Hall” was just a brick building the size of a McDonald’s with “City of Roanoke” on it, and across the street was the kind of gas station that looks more like a farmer’s co-op with gas pumps. Crates of squash and car parts.

Next to that was a park with a baseball diamond and a playground, and I guess the school was on the other side of that. It looked like a school, anyway. Jacob parked at the Pay-N-Tote, and Steven got the guy on the phone. The whole time he talked, he had this weird look on his face like Diaper Guy was in the car again.

“What is it?” I asked him as he pressed the mouthpiece end of the phone against his leg and took a drink of his Sprite.

“He sounds a lot older than I thought he would be.”

“Like how old?” Dylan asked, mildly alarmed.

“I dunno. 40s? 50s? He talks fast and he’s all raspy, like an old ranch-hand or something. Sounds like he hollers a lot. And he has a real deep accent, like Paula Deen.”

Dylan bit back disgust, trying to look impassive. “I hope there’s not something up with this suit. I don’t want old-man jizz on me.”

“I don’t think there is,” said Ashleigh. “It looked clean and new in the picture.” And it did, really. You couldn’t tell in the photos, but when we finally got up close and personal with it, the fursuit was glossy like an actress’s hair in a conditioner commercial.

Eric—the Craigslist guy—arranged for us to meet in a church parking lot on the far side of Roanoke. “Where is it?” Steven put his cellphone on speaker mode. “I didn’t even know City Hall til we got right up on it.”

“You’ll know it when you see it,” said Eric, and I had to admit Steven was right. Craigslist Dude sounded like he should be catching alligators in a swamp somewhere, his voice a string of nervous, rapid-fire twang like he was in an artificial hurry.

We passed through the main clot of Roanoke and the dustbowl houses started thinning out again.

“Ho, lee-*shit,”* said Jacob.

Steven turned the radio down. “Is there a Scientology chapter out here or what?”

Then I leaned forward from the back seat and saw it, screened through a stand of trees: Eric’s “church” looked like an airport terminal. It was massive, easily the biggest building in Roanoke. It looked like a million-dollar complex, a sprawling nest of concrete archways and two stories of floor-to-ceiling glass windows the same dusky blue as a bottle of Windex. Part of the church climbed the hill behind it and made another wing.

Eric’s pickup truck was the only car in the parking lot, and he sat on his tailgate, a scarecrow ragdoll in a pair of bib overalls and an orange ball cap, kicking his feet like a little kid in a swing.

We parked behind him and got out.

Eric didn’t have any upper teeth, but that didn’t seem to slow him down much. He could talk a hole through a board fence. “Nice to meetcha nice to meetcha,” he said, shaking Steven’s, Dylan’s, and my hand. “Y’all here for the medicine man getup.”

“Medicine—?” I asked.

“Medicine man medicine man,” Eric spat, a horsey smile on his face. He moved constantly like he had Parkinson’s, his head never still but his eyes locked on me. In hindsight, he was probably on meth. “My great-great-grandaddy, he was an Indian from around these parts, you know, his daddy was a medicine man, he was full-blood Coosa, passed it right down to me, I’m about one-fourth Coosa—part Irish and part German too.” He snapped a salute, grinning.

He had the bear fursuit laid out in the back of his truck on a canvas tarp like he’d killed the bear on the way over.

“Wow, it does look really clean,” said Dylan.

“I take real good care of it.” Eric doffed his cap just long enough to run his fingers through his bone-colored hair. “Whole fam dam’ly has, ever since the old days, just ain’t no sense lettin a thing like this go to hell y’know?”

I passed a hand over the suit. It was like petting a well-groomed Golden Retriever—silky, smooth, dry. Uniform in color: root beer brown that prismed red where the sunlight struck it. The body was loose, empty, limp, but the paws and the head were solid. The bear’s head was as girthy as my chest, with a bull terrier muzzle and dark spyglass eyes. Its paws were like catchers’ mitts, with five heavy claws, each the length of my finger.

“Made outta real bear skin,” said Eric, proudly.

“What?” asked Dylan.

“Ayup, passed down from my great-great-grandaddy, he was an Indian from around these parts you know?” The old man stared at him. “I said so on the innernet thing, ‘real bear skin’ it said, yuh I remember.”

Dylan looked at Ashleigh. “You didn’t say anything about that.”

“I didn’t think you’d want to have anything to do with it.”

Dylan sighed. “Did you know?” he sighed, looking at Steven, who nodded as if he’d been caught pissing on the carpet.

“Did you know, Cody?”

I shook my head. “I didn’t.”

“Well, you know what?” Dylan folded his beefy arms. “I know you all think I’m going to puss out now and tell this guy we’re going home, but we drove all the way out here and by God I’m going to wear this thing. If Bear Grylls can drink his own urine out of a dead rattlesnake, then I can at least have the balls to put on an heirloom shaman suit.”

Eric paused, then gave him a quick finger six-gun and leaned against the tailgate, hovering over the bear suit. “Good man good man, heem got beeg balls like bear,” he said, parting the bear’s chest hair. Hiding in the middle were leather laces, which he untied. “You know there ain’t no ‘shamans’ in the First Nation tribes though, right—my daddy used to say that ain’t even a Indian word.”

He pulled the flaps to either side. For a brief instant I think I expected to see a bloody rib cage.

There was nothing inside but what appeared to be tan fabric.

Eric hauled the head over to him so that the “bear” was sitting up, and turned the “helmet” upside down to show us the inside. Sunlight shined through the bear’s eyes, casting twin spotlights on the coffee-colored head liner. “The inside’s been replaced several times,” said Eric, showing us each in turn, as if it were a magic trick. “Last time was calf suede, pure high-quality calf suede, bout twenty years ago and they ain’t nobody wore it since—well ‘cept once I got the head on, and my daddy whooped my ass for putting it on.”

“Is it hot?” asked Dylan.

“Naw it breathes real good I ‘magine.” He polished the bear’s left eye with a thumb. “Got glass orbs for eyes, you can see right through it like a shotglass, man.”

I picked up the nearest paw and slipped my hand into it. To my surprise, the claws were hollow, and my fingers slid into them like five swords into five scabbards, each one down to the second knuckle. The skin was stiff, but I could just barely wiggle my fingers.",1,1758134092.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I would even understand some of the foods, like the salmon skin, but he never shows interest in these foods when we actually offer it to him, and believe me, we do. I offer him ""human"" food that is safe for him all the time, before I start cooking it etc. But he never cares for it, I even try leaving it in his bowl for later but nope, 99% of not-cat food that he is offered he does not care for. But then he does this when we look away and then I am surprised by stepping in slimy buttery salmon skin on carpet or a bunch of ants around the crumbled cookies...WHY does he do this?

I always have drank coffee but without realizing it I started taking it way too far. For starters, I get constant headaches already and began depending on at least 1 excedrin a day just so I could work without headaches. I didn’t even realize that I started suffering from rebound headaches from taking even just one daily. At the same time I started drinking more coffee. Monster made these canned iced coffees (triple expresso shots, 300mg of caffeine) that I started drinking everyday before work to have energy. Suddenly my insomnia started getting really bad which made me open my eyes that am consuming an ungodly amount of caffeine a day. So I’ve started cutting it off. Currently I completely cut off the excedrin and started only drinking the monster iced coffees but those were still making my insomnia worst so now I’ve cut those off and am trying to replace them completely with either a cup of coffee or a small expresso and cream Starbucks canned coffee that the internet says has only 60mg of caffeine and green tea. However my nausea is horrible. I’ve barely even got a headache I just feel fuzzy and super nauseous. Yesterday it gave me diarrhea all day and made me feel like I had the flu. I keep getting really hot as well which I’ve checked my fever and don’t have one thankfully. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with these symptoms?

I do website flipping. I build, grow and sell websites as a side hustle. I've done 6-7 sales this year so far, including my latest flip, a 3+ year blog that sold for $26,500.

# How it works?

I wrote up a free guide on the process [here](http://www.jennaffiliate.com/website-flipping-guide).

Basically, what I do is I build websites (wordpress blogs) around topics that interest me. I've created websites about:

* Gardening
* Hair and beauty
* Business
* Budgeting and personal finance
* Homesteading
* Travel
* Food
* Coffee

It can be about virtually any topic. You can do a starter website that has thin content, but fully built out as a professional, fully functional website.

Or, you can develop it over the long-term, monetize and grow the traffic, SEO, etc.

It's a win either way but, the big money maker is going for the long-term site. My long-term websites have sold between $1,250 and $80K+ each.

# Here's the opening bid I got on my latest starter site

1njlb6e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1njlb6e,Omgosh it worked: Floral Arch Pieces made of coffee filter flowers and faux florals,"Here’s my first arch piece from a few angles. The last pic is of the two poles for reference. 

Is it just me or is this turning out super well?? I have been planning this for MONTHS and have just been hoping my vision will pan out. There are still a few things to play with but this is proof of concept folks—we will have a floral arch!! (Fiancée and I were ready to chuck the idea if it flopped.)

I wanted to share a bit about how this turned out since I love seeing breakdowns by others. I can answer questions in the comments too. 


INSPO:
We’re getting married in October at a small art gallery, creative formal dress code. My fiancée is wearing a white dress and I’m wearing an ivory suit with big but sparse red and purple flowers on it. 

Our colour vibe is like a joyful dark romance. I really like the disco balls and vintage reds & cream that are on trend right now, and wanted to approach that from a more 70s decor vibe than straight up disco balls. 


DIY INFO: 
The greenery, bright blue and red spray, and the dark red dahlias are faux, and the rest are coffee filter and tissue paper flowers I made. The greenery is a willow garland wrapped around and some individual paddles of Italian ruscus. 

It’s affixed with a cylinder of chicken wire and zip ties, and I’ve used a bit of green wrapped floral wire to help pieces stick up and hold in place. 


NEXT STEPS:
I will build out the side a bit more so there’s 1/2 to 2/3 coverage, then I’ll add more greenery to the back to cover that up since the back of our arch will be visible from the cocktail area. I doubt I’d have enough florals to fill the back too, but I’ll see if it’s necessary. 

***
I know this post is just a big gush lol but I am also interested in ideas to help this vision pop. I also feel like I might be underutilizing the greenery… Thoughts are welcome! 🤗 ",15,1758133965.0,DIYweddings,3,1.0,False

This coffee is processed by Wildan Mustofa and his wife Atieq, at their wet mill at Frinsa Estate.
Wildan Mustofa and his wife, Atieq Mustikaningtyas, embarked on their first coffee project in the Sindangkerta, Weninggalih area back in 2010, which eventually evolved into Java Frinsa Estate.

The process is an Extended Fermentation Natural:

Cherry fermentation occurs for 4 days underwater. Due to the wet, humid climate, most of their coffees are also pre-dried in their greenhouse, a groundbreaking shift for the Indonesian market. The whole cherry is then dried on the ground or in a parabolic dryer. This has resulted in more uniform drying, and therefore more consistent outcomes.

Coffee fermented by lactic method has a complex, mild and smooth character with malic acidity. They mainly dry on patio, but are investing in way more drying tables for the future.

Currently most of the coffees are pre dried on beds for a day or two in green houses and then transferred to the patio. Drying can take 14-20 days, depending on the rain during the drying period.",1,1758133674.0,FellowProducts,3,1.0,False

1njl5gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1njl5gq/for_those_of_you_with_longer_maternity_leaves_4/,"For those of you with longer maternity leaves (4+ months) - what is your daily ""schedule"" like?","I'm off for 13-18 months (depending on daycare availability) and I've been trying to treat mat leave like my ""job"" to kind of break up the day and give us some structure. My baby is 8 weeks old and I know they don't have a ""schedule"" yet theoretically, but I really need some kind of structure and I'm looking for ideas from other caregivers who are off for a long period of time. 

Currently ours is as follows:

Wake window 1 (1 hour) wakeup, change diaper, vitamin D, feed, face-to-face interaction (singing, talking, back and forth ""conversations"")

Nap #1 45 mins- 2 hours depending on baby. I shower, brush my teeth, make coffee, have breakfast, and chill (usually looking up baby related stuff or prepping for later in the day)

Wake window 2 (1-1.25 hours) change diaper, feed, tummy time, sing songs/talk, prep for outing 

Nap #2 1-2 hours (usually a stroller and car nap) - this happens around noon - we go out somewhere just so I can break up my day. Running errands, out for lunch, to the park for a walk, whatever. 

Wake window 3 (1 hour) - usually once we get home, though this will be on the road if I'm out for longer. Typically around 2pm. Here I will change diaper, feed, tummy time/play with toys/read, and then I typically baby wear her while I start to prep dinner 

Nap #3 (45 mins-1 hour) contact nap in carrier or sitting down, depending where I'm at in my meal prep and chores. I try to eat an easy lunch at this point. 

Wake window 4 (1-1.5 hours) diaper, feed, walk around our building (we have awesome gardens so I take her around and we look at flowers, trees, bumble bees and butterflies (unsure if she can see them lmao) or we sit outside on the balcony and look at flowers, get some sunshine (shaded sunshine for baby) and fresh air. We then do some tummy time with happy babies, toes to hands, side lying, and torticollis stretches (these happen at most wake windows). 

Nap #4 (around 5-530pm) - At the end I'll wear her and start cooking dinner, and when she starts to snooze I'll pause and try to put her down in the bassinet. Typically my husband comes home around this point and either takes over baby or dinner. 

Then she will have a pretty big wake window #5, sometimes from 6-830 even though we try not to let that happen. She typically has ""witching hour"" around this time so she's fussy and doesn't want to go down. We will sometimes do another car nap while we go out for dessert together, or go for a walk in the neighbourhood, run an errand together, etc. 

830pm is bedtime and I wish it was a tiny bit later like 9/930 but she seems to be unable to go any longer at this point and will not wakeup unless we wake her and force her to engage, which doesn't feel great. She will do a 5-6 hour stretch at this point, which is why id prefer her bedtime was a tiny bit later so we could get the majority of the night to sleep. 

Anyway, some days this schedule works, and others she will only do short naps unless in the car or on me (and yesterday even contact naps were SHORT like 30 mins) which makes me kind of crazy and touched out and feel totally unable to do anything at all. It sucks because it ruins my day a bit and I start getting emotional about it by the time my husband gets home. Yesterday I full on cried for like 20 mins when he got home because we just had such a bad day full of nap refusals, very short contact naps, a short car ride nap (only 45 mins ugh), and just a really needy baby who wouldn't even go down for my husband and I had to breastfeed to sleep for her 5/6pm nap. The whole thing just had me feeling anxious that she's getting super dependent on only me and I'm IT. My husband is super supportive and said my only objective for my days should be to shower, eat and have coffee and he can do the rest when he gets home... But then I need a break from baby and will have to do the chores that didn't get done during the day/will be cooking dinner instead of relaxing. But then so will he, either way (baby or chores). 

I'm wondering how other people are managing the days and also what is your routine when your partner gets home at the end of the day? I would ideally like some wind-down time for us together with no baby and no chores required. Right now we're so pooched that she goes to bed at 830 and we follow at 9.

I've gone to the doctor many times about this. The doctor says well you're just aging. And that sucks. But sometimes it doesn't happen, and I'm having a hard time figuring out why. 

The only thing that seems to have made a difference was to reduce my caffeine intake. Your ability to process caffeine changes as you age (I'm in my 50s). Some people it changes a lot apparently. Like my mother has no issues with caffeine processing, but I do. So I've reduced down to one cup of coffee in the morning, split over 3 cups because of how I'm mixing the beans. 

Now you might be thinking well that's dehydration. Except no amount of water will actually fix it. I try with electrolytes, I try without electrolytes, I try with vitamins, I try it without vitamins. The only thing that actually works is reducing my caffeine intake. It's like the caffeine is blocking my body's ability to retain water. Before I reduced my caffeine intake I would occasionally get visual distortion from the dehydration. Maybe you've never heard of that, but I checked with my optometrist and she said yeah that's definitely possible.

I met him about 4 years ago, we didn’t talk for a couple years, then started talking again about 6 months ago. 

When we first started talking, I thought he was damn near perfect. He was working a bunch, cooked for himself every night, prioritized his health and made me feel so special. 

Although I think he’s very attractive, society might view me as “out of his league”. He knows that. He constantly makes comments about how he doesn’t deserve me, I should be with a doctor/lawyer, etc. I reassure him that I want him, because I really do!

The past couple of months, he’s made a big switch-up and I’m confused. He started excessively smoking weed again and is always high when I’m with him. He started eating really poorly. He isn’t going to the gym. He’s barely working. Most of all, he isn’t treating me great. He says a lot of kind things to me and I’m always reassured in that way. However, there’s no dates. There’s no flowers. There’s no doing the little things. 

When I love, I love really hard! We mainly hangout at his house and I constantly clean, cook, do laundry, etc. for him. Whenever I get food or coffee, I get him some. I go out of my way to spend time with his friends/family. The effort isn’t reciprocated. 

I’ve started to get upset because he tells me he doesn’t deserve me, but doesn’t put effort in to being a better man. I’m starting to be less attracted to him as I watch him neglect himself, because super messy, be stoned all the time, etc.

I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or why he’s acting like this. Even his friends have made comments about his recent change. Apart of me thinks that when a man has a good/attractive woman who loves them, they start to self sabotage.

I want to see him be his best self and treat me right. If he truly thinks I deserve better, I want him to be better!

Is there life after this?,"Is it a waste of the physical therapist's time if I'm back already, a month after discharge, for the same symptoms all over again?

Background: I'm 14 months postpartum, grade 2 bladder prolapse and ""incomplete uterine prolapse"" (whatever that means), plus hypermobile urethra. I finally got these all diagnosed a month ago, after literally a year of going from one gynecologist to another, urgent cares, PCPs, urologist, and several different pelvic floor PTs, trying to get help for the symptoms I was feeling (that heavy, dropping out feeling and the constant urge to pee without complete emptying, plus constipation). I finally got into a urogynecologist the day before I discharged from pelvic floor PT, where I'd been seeing a physical therapist who was finally helping me feel better and bounce back quicker from symptomatic days. The urogynecologist gave me a ring pessary with support and told me since PT was helping me I could just wear the pessary as needed when I want the extra support. The urogynecologist I saw at my follow up appointment wants me to wear it full time despite the fact that it causes incontinence leaks when I wear it (a symptom I never had before). 

3 weeks after being discharged from PT, I've been doing some home exercises but admittedly not as many repetitions or as wide a variety of exercises as I'm supposed to, and really none with any resistance or weight. It's been a busy time with back to school season, but I admit that's on me for being a bad patient! But I was still feeling alright up until I moved around my coffee table to vacuum my living room; after that I felt more heaviness than I'd experienced in a while, the kind where I knew I f'd up and needed to go lie down. Unfortunately that was the night before a big trip I was going to take, so the next morning I put in my pessary because I figured I'd need the extra help to get through TSA with my carry-on backpack suitcase, walk through the airports, etc. The pessary normally fits great, but over the 24 hours I wore it not only did my dropping feeling get worse, but I constantly felt the urge to pee, I would be unable to pee much at all one moment and then 10 minutes later at the next bathroom trip the floodgates would open like something had been blocking my bladder. It felt like all my core strength was gone, like I was trying to hold my body up with some muscle at the bottom of my rib cage/bra band area. I could barely walk my luggage over to the check in counter on the trip back, and I sat at my gate crying wondering if I should ask for a wheelchair when I got to the gate at my destination. The week following the trip was spent mostly laying down, especially after a bike ride to pick up my child from school that resulted in a couple days of buzzing/discomfort in my clitoral area that only ever resolved by taking an Azo. 

By that point, I called up the pelvic floor PT, explained that something had happened to where I felt like I'd regressed several months, and got on their books for a new appointment. Well anonymous internet strangers, that appointment is tomorrow and **I feel completely fine**. Just a mild dropping out feeling that I can ignore. Not any urgency to speak of. Felt so good I was on my feet all day yesterday batch cooking up a ton of food, playing with my kids, walking around the block. I feel so guilty! It's too late to cancel the appointment, but I feel like I'm wasting the PT's time and taking a spot from someone who might really be suffering tomorrow. Literally a week ago I was telling my spouse that I want to set up an advance directive/living will to refuse life-saving treatment, because this is no way to live if I can't even sit up, walk, hold my kids, etc. And now, I'm so grateful to be feeling almost normal again, but so confused at what the hell I just lived through.

I wish I knew what happened and if I could prevent it happening again. My body just feels like a ticking time bomb. At this point I just want to know how I can avoid that ever happening again. Does this mean I can no longer travel? Can't lift anything heavier than 10 pounds? We had so many dreams of more children, and now that I've just weaned my baby last week in a desperate attempt at relief my heart is breaking at the idea that this is the end of my baby days. I don't understand what I did to make this happen to my body, and I don't understand how I keep inflaming the prolapse. I just want to live my life normally. Without wearing period underwear for the passive leaking. Without feeling like a raggedy ann doll with no ab muscles. Without wondering when the next awful spell of symptoms is going to happen. I feel so paralyzed. And I'm only 30, is this only going to get worse with time?",2,1758133456.0,PelvicOrganProlapse,2,1.0,False

I was going to just right all this out on my notes to see observe my progress, moods, side-effects, etc. on this journey but realized that it could be helpful to those that are considering this medication as well. 

I am currently on Kit 3 with the Bupropion + Naltrexone HLC + Topiramate + B12 combination. 

Currently I am 147 lbs at 5ft tall, I have exercised regularly in the past and even finished a marathon, but I find it difficult since we've moved across the world recently back to the states, we have our 1 year old, and I starting working full time again. My goal is to shed some lbs because, admittedly, it does feel a lot harder to move around and even run. I'd like to run another marathon next year for my 30th.. For now, I consistently go on walks at least 20-30 mins a day with my son and husband 4-5x a week. 

This week some side effects I felt was lightheadedness, memory fog, and anxiousness. I felt a bit more emotional too. As far as hunger, I really didn't snack that much.. though i did have a little bit of salty craving. I had diarrhea for first 3 days of taking the medications, but not too bad...not like stomach bug, just upset stomach. 

Mentally I felt more overwhelmed than I usually would and found myself crying and feeling really just spent. I could remember certain things at work and that made me feel really bad at work. i don't have a scale (i'm considering getting one for more accurate progress reading, i recently went to the doctor to get my current weight) but I'm using my clothes for reference at the moment and i feel a bit bloated. 

Some outside factors that might have skewed this experience: 

\-I am 1 1/2 weeks away from my period (I typically experience bad pms)

\-my baby was really sick and could get time off from work to be with him 

\-lots of political turmoil and thinking ""why the heck did move back to the states""!?

\-not eating breakfast cause I'm always rushing out the door 

\-drinking coffee in the morning only 

\-and taking the green pill daily when it was advised every other day!? (OMG)

Something I did to help with some of that was practicing some breathing exercises and deleting social media. i got some magnesium glycinate pills and probiotics to help with other symptoms and buying some protein bars from trader joes to much on while driving to work.

At the hospital they gave me the softer benzos, then valium againd and again, then IV valium twice. It had no effect. I needed such high doses and even stronger meds that I got moved to a separate room with an EKG and constant monitoring, IV's sticking out of both arms

Apparently they'd never seen doses like that before, or someone coherent at a BAC of 3.7. 10 days of shaking and severe WDs. Got moved to a detox place and even they were puzzled by the doses, severity and length of my WDs. I'm relatively young, and haven't been drinking hard for more than two years. But guess stopping and starting really ups the kindling. 

8 days of bendering and it took me 14 days to get released.  

I don't know why I collapsed, why the WDs lasted forever, or why I needed absolutely incredible amounts of meds - but I know I can't do it again. 

Guess I managed to get myself incredibly kindled in two years, and the now 8 detoxes upped my tolerance to valium or something. The first time I felt sort of OK day two and fine day three. 

Day 14 now and I'm still a little shaky and anxious, but thankfully I feel mostly normal. More like having a few cups of coffee too many than actual WDs.

Following up with a specialist weekly starting this week. I can't keep doing this. If you told me I'd spend two years like this three years ago I'd think you were insane. Yet here we are. 

I have no idea why I relapse when I know it just gets worse every time. I don't even crave alcohol sober really. Just insanity.

1njkx2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1njkx2c/toupet_fundoplication_robotic_15_days_post/,"Toupet fundoplication, robotic, 15 days post procedure","I wanted to tell my experience because so far it has been very positive.  I am 68, F, 156 lbs.  On 09/02/25 I had robotic surgery to repair a type 4 (my entire stomach) HH. My only symptom prior was anemia. Hernia was found during an endoscopy/colonoscopy looking for bleeds. Endoscopy was not completed because things were all squashed up in my chest. My Gastroenterologist sent me to the surgeon to “get it fixed before it becomes a real problem.”  My surgeon makes everyone do a 10 day clear liquid liver shrinking diet of broths, protein shakes, sugar free popsicles and jello, crystal light, and LOTS of water to prep for surgery. It was NOT fun, but post surgery the surgeon described my liver as  ‘tiny’ and said he didn’t even have to use a liver retractor. The procedure took roughly 4 hours and I woke up at lunchtime in a hospital room. I immediately got out of bed (nurse watching) and made the first of many trips that afternoon to the bathroom. I still had an IV for fluids and pain/nausea medicine—fluids in/fluids out. Mid afternoon it occurred to me that I was having NO ISSUES getting in or out of bed. The incisions just weren’t causing much pain. There were five—belly button, two left, two right, and some bruises. Everything was covered with superglue bandages. They kept me pretty pain free and sleepy that day but not so much I couldn’t walk independently. Hospital gave me a post surgery clear liquid lunch and supper. I ignored the tepid broth but drank the apple juice and ate the jello. Throat was a little sore. It was better the next morning. I was home by 10:30 a.m. 

At home the dreaded gas pains in my neck and shoulders were very evident, but walking definitely helped. I have a big dog so I had to walk anyway.  I had a prescription for generic norco. I used 7 of the 18 pills over a two week period. I alternated between Tylenol and Advil otherwise. Pain was the worst at night and lying down exacerbated the neck/shoulder pain. I found some relief with cold packs or the heating pad. Sometimes I just got up and watched TV with a blanket and pillow (& the dog) on the couch, eventually falling asleep there. Walking ALWAYS helped the pain.  There is a tightness/pain when taking deep breaths because the diaphragm has been sewed closed. It was worse, but it’s better every day. At times I get a kicked between the shoulder blades feeling, but not too often. Sneezing hurts. I can burp a little. I’m not sure if I could vomit but luckily haven’t needed to do so.

I was told to continue a liquid diet for two weeks post. At the follow-up appointment the surgeon asked if I had started to cheat on the liquids and I admitted I went home and made a grilled cheese sandwich the day after surgery—which I ate in tiny bites and chewed VERY thoroughly. Some things  made me choke, and it’s a painful lesson. It was always caused by me deviating from the soft diet and not chewing thoroughly. Water is your friend. I am supposed to be cautiously reintroducing a normal diet at this point but still staying with softer foods for another two weeks. I never had reflux and have experienced none post surgery. 

The incisions are mostly healed. I could always  get out of bed, off the couch, tie my shoes with no noticeable discomfort. Everyone’s experience is different, and I consider myself lucky and fortunate. I credit my surgeon, and he credits the robotics for the less invasive surgery. I was told to not do anything that caused pain for a few more weeks at least. I skipped a visit to grandkids because the 4 and 6 year olds won’t understand that I can’t pick them up yet. Pulling weeds caused some pain in the diaphragm and I backed off. 

OK the bad. SOMETHING is giving me gas and diarrhea. The surgeon said gastrointestinal problems are normal for six weeks post procedure. I’m starting to keep a log—is it because I started drinking coffee again or was it the Thai food? Or my iron supplement I just reintroduced? It isn’t constant, but it has been inconvenient at times. 

I just wanted to post a positive experience. Some of what I read scared me leading up to surgery. If anyone has any questions, I’ll check back.",5,1758133092.0,HiatalHernia,3,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1njktqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1njktqi/tilt_pro_accuracy_question_double_batch_different/,"Tilt Pro accuracy question - double batch, different OG","Howdy all,

So I brewed a double batch yesterday, just scoped a 5 gal recipe to 10 gals and once wort was chilled, transferred to two corny kegs to get rolling on pressurized fermentation.

Both kegs had all the same treatment (cold brew coffee and toasted coconut flakes in the bottom), then transferred wort, then oxygenated both 30 seconds, then pitched yeast, then dropped in a Tilt Pro in each one.

Capped up, put spunding valves on, then reset my Tilt loggings on both devices (one black, one blue) and linked to batches in Brewfather.

First loggings I was expecting to see the same OG values, and expect some slight initial turbulence while it settles. But I had one at 1.078 and the other at 1.069. Kind of seems a big variance to me.

Almost 24 hours in I see them both at the same ABV so far, 4.5%. 

Wondering if one or both are just not calibrated or they are at least not having the same calibration perhaps?",1,1758132889.0,Homebrewing,4,0.67,False

Hey everyone! I work in a small branch office for a larger company and today I am the only one in the office. I work in data analytics so it isn't like people come into my office to talk to me often. Coffee isn't working well enough today, so I am here to see if anyone wants to chat to help me keep awake. I live close to a National Park so I do a lot of hiking and that stuff. I like mountain biking and running, learning to program better, and if I can't go outside and don't feel like messing with python, I do some games. I am pretty chill and can talk about a anything really. Let me know if you want to chat. I would appreciate the distraction! ",1,1758132874.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
