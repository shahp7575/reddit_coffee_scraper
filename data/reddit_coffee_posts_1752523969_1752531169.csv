Anagrams are my pathological hobby relating to my mental health condition (paranoid schizophrenia, high intelligence bracket).

My anagramming and schizophrenia go hand in hand in a way, seeing as a mind experiencing psychosis is a mind theorised to have gone into pattern seeking overdrive.
  This is caused by the presence of too much dopamine within the mind, dopamine is the reward chemical that makes us feel happy when we have achieved noticing patterns in our environment that aid our survival! And, well, anagramming provides a gold mine with regards to pattern formations!

I'm wondering if there is anyone else with unusual interests they can teach me about!

but man, there are a few that were just instant regret. the worst so far was store brand cereal that was supposed to be like honey nut cheerios. it had this weird aftertaste that lingered for hours. i couldn’t even finish the bowl.

another one was off-brand cream cheese. i thought i wouldn’t notice if i just spread it on a bagel but it was weirdly grainy and kind of sour in a bad way. it ruined my breakfast and i ended up throwing the rest out.

peanut butter is hit or miss too. i tried a cheaper one and it was so oily on top no matter how much i stirred, and somehow still dry when you ate it. don’t even get me started on cheap coffee. i know some people say you can’t tell but i definitely can.

most store brand pasta and canned veggies seem fine, and baking stuff like sugar or flour is basically identical. but there are some things i just can’t bring myself to buy off-brand anymore after one bad experience.

1m002uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1m002uu/hurt_and_confused_and_scared/,Hurt and confused. And scared.,"My husband (40m) and I (38f) have been together since high school. He has had *numerous...* episodes/tantrums/whatever over the years of being mean and things similar to what I will be discussing in this post. He has had periods of being downright cruel [1] as well. But, this... this past month has had me absolutely broken. I think I need out. At least temporarily til something can be done... if anything. I am usually quite eloquent and write well but I'm still in a fog of pain and hurt so I'm going to try not to ramble but include pertinent information. This is probably going to be long though. I just have no one else that I feel comfortable enough to bounce these thoughts off against.

[1 - one particular time that comes to mind is when I was six months pregnant with our second child. We were visiting his family up north and had a very long drive from one location to another. He refused to stop at a rest stop or ANY bathroom when I needed to urinate. I cried for almost an hour for him to just pull over and i would just pee on the side of the road - it was March somewhere between Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio - in the snow. I'm a Floridian. I hate snow. I didnt even care if it froze coming out of me. I begged. But, no. He never stopped and never apologized. He didnt feel like making a detour because he was tired.]

I have been chronically ill my entire life (moderate to severe GI, respiratory, musculoskeletal issues) since I was a toddler. I could fill a library's worth of medical documentation and imaging. I've had 11 spinal surgeries (2012, 2014, 2016, 2017x5, 2018x2, 2022). I was diagnosed with generalized joint hypermobility, inflammatory polyarthropathy, fibromyalgia, unknown autoimmune disorder in 2021 (My rheumatologist is up in the air about lupus/mixed connective tissue disorder/another autoimmune disorder as my labs and inflammation always come back high but different combinations.) I do have antiphospholipid syndrome (blood clotting disorder) and have had life-threatening clot episodes. My doc has told me to treat any sudden, severe, unrelenting pain as potentially life-threatening. I have periods of MONTHS that I am feeling like a human, super human.  but there are times where I am just incapacitated recently and its a huge ordeal.

Despite all this, I work 25-35 hours a week in guest services in a big box retailer. Unfortunately,  our hours are down so we end up doing the jobs of three people. Many shifts I will have to do guest service, order pickups, register and man self checkout all by myself. This is A LOT of running around, turning, bending, twisting and getting constantly yelled at/rude customers for things completely out of my control. Also, the AC is set at 75° in the store and its broken half the time. I'm in South Florida. It's hot and humid as hell; we even have guests leave the store because its too warm to shop sometimes.) There are many days that I collapse and cry in my car after work before I drive off due to exhaustion/pain. I do 100% of the cooking daily,  100% grocery/household shopping (occasionally he will come with but he will never go by himself), 90% cleaning (kids do other 10%), 95% laundry (husband takes baskets up and downstairs, will occasionally start the washer but thats it), most of the household maintenance (i fixed our toilet a few times, replace filters), all the driving around including to and from work/school (we have one car [2]), setting up/taking to appointments, make his coffee/breakfast/lunch every workday. He tells me I have to do all the car maintenance too (appointments, cleaning the car out, etc).

He is a charge nurse in a psychiatric hospital and works 36 hours a week. He will pick up and extra shift here or there as well. He has expressed his frustrations and stresses with work numerous times. I also kind of understand what he experiences - i was a neurosurgical nurse for almost ten years and did charge for a few of those years, at his sister hospital. It was Hell on Earth at that place. i cant imagine his hospital - especially being the psych portion - is any better. He, as mentioned before, works. He takes the garbage out because I cannot lift heavy bags over my head and into the dumpster (we live in a townhouse that has a little dumpster area), otherwise I would probably be doing the garbage, too. i have been asking him to help me around the house more because I have just been feeling worse and worse lately. This has caused quite a few blowups.

[2 - sometimes when we have fights, he threatens to take the car away from me. He says I can't use it to go to work anymore.]

Last month (which could be another long ass post itself relating to something cruel he said that made me feel unsafe and insecure in our relationship. He said I was being too emotional. I had a medical event scare me and he mocked me instead of letting me explain why i was going through the emotions I was having). He told me he was tired of paying for my medical bills.(I have pretty decent insurance through work but it's more expensive this year. My meds are relatively low. However, i do have a deductible and coinsurance.) I apologized to him that Im sick but I neeed to go to the doctor and manage my chronic illnesses. Because of his statements about the cost of my medical bills, I canceled a procedure I needed (I have an IUD embedded in my uterus) and follow ups for my joint issues.

I have been having right upper abdominal and back pain going on a few weeks now. It's affecting me at work, I can barely move around for more than an hour without getting a lot of pain and nausea. I vomit when i sneeze or cough. My abdomen is distended. It's affecting my household responsibilities, too. I like having a clean home but i can only do a little here and there because of my abdominal issues. I have an appointment with my PCP on the 30th to address this as it has been quite bothersome and affecting my quality of life. 

On Saturday, I felt awful at work (8am to 3pm). I almost left early but we were so busy i didnt want to leave my coworkers stranded so I touched it out. We went to a party for my niece's graduation right after. I ate some of a Pubsub ring and my mom's potato salad. I couldn't really eat much though. I didnt eat dinner. That night (7:30pm). I had severe right upper abdomen pain that was piercing through my back.  I had my gallbladder removed in 2016 but it was very similar to that pain. He said ""oh do you want to go to the hospital now?"" I said crying, ""yes please.""

He told me I had to wait until after he was done watching the rest of his show because he didnt think i really needed to go then because I was complaining about it for so long. I started crying harder and told him I really needed to go. He said no I had to wait. I went across the hall and cried on the floor of our son's room for a good 20 minutes. 

He comes into the hallway and snaps at me ""cmon. Let's go. You wanted to go so bad."" I told him he was selfish for making me wait. What if he felt like he really needed to go to the hospital and i did that to him? He avoided that question. He just kept saying he didn't think i wanted to go.

[Here's the kicker. I *hate* being hospitalized. I was hospitalized for 370 days in 2017/2018 due to a spinal infection. I had never met a sicker neurosurgical patient than myself before that point and many of my coworkers thought the same. (i have many more stories from that period from what I can remember of being treated downright cruelly. I was septic a good portion of the time so it's a bit foggy here and there). He knows I hate going to the ER. I went three months ago for an organ prolapse and before that was at least a year to rule out another pulmonary embolism. I *hate* hospitals.]

The whole car ride there he keeps berating me about crying and calling him selfish saying i was being the mean one for yelling at him. I begged for him to stop it i was in so much pain. He waits with me for a little but just continues to do things (sits far away from me when I am balled up in pain and want a hug, i wanted him to ask the desk person a question but that was an unacceptable request as well) and i asked him to just go. He waits in the car for awhile. I text him it's going to be a long time and to just go back home so he leaves. 

I was at the ER for about five hours. After testing and blood work, they offered to admit me for pain management and to see GI/uro. I have markedly elevated liver enzymes and my bloodwork for the third time in a row has shown some kidney issues - it appears i could be in chronic kidney disease stage 2. I also have a small unobstructing kidney stone, which should just resolve on its own. I asked if anything was life threatening, which it wasn't, so I asked to be discharged. 

I called my husband and he picked me up... he quickly apologized for being mean. I said okay. Then said ""well, what about you?"" After a pause, I just said ""im sorry too."" I feel like i didn't have anything to apologize for but I was just so done and tired  and defeated.

He then asked if we could have sex the next day.  That was a quite car ride home. We got home around 3am. I probably fell asleep by 3:30.

He woke me up at 8:30. He asked if we could have sex before we went to the grocery store. I was just discharged feom the ER five hours ago and he asked me this. I told him no. I dont think so. I dragged my self up and got ready. We went to the grocery store, me hobbling around the whole time. We get home I take a nap. He asks about sex... again. No. Again. 

Now its time to make dinner. An elaborate dinner that I had pre-planned but now couldn't even eat because im on a bland diet. I asked if he could wash the pot and pan i needed so I wasn't standing so much. He begrudgingly gets up, washes them, doesn't dry them, gets water on the floor which he doesnt dry either, and plops them down on the glass cook top. I get nervous he is going to crack it one of these days. It took about two hours to make dinner when it normally takes about an hour. My dinner consisted of a small bowl of mashed baby yellow potatoes. 

I collapse on the couch after dinner. He asks. Again. No. He asks if i can atleasr come upstairs to spend time with him and watch a show. I told him I was too exhausted to move and we could watch it down here. He asks if I wanted to play my video game and I told him I was too fatigued to even move for that. He gets upset and stomps upstairs. He then says that I can just lay down upstairs and rest. I cave and agree as long as he doesn't kick me out (another thing he does whrn he is mad at me). He promises. 

I drag myself upstairs and plop on the bed. At around 7:30 i asked if he could do his laundry because I was still feeling really bad and it was early enough that he could do it before going to sleep. He said he does so much for me and that I can wash his laundry. I told him I have zero energy and my stomach and back hurt really bad. (I wash his laundry every single night. If he has washed his clothes it has been MAYBE a handful of times in three years but I dont recall him ever washing his uniform.) He once again says he does *everything* for us. I said yes you do a lot for us but I also do all of the cooking, almost all of rhe laundry, taking too and from work, school, making appointments. My stomach hurts. Please wash your clothing. You can wash them. He responds with well i guess my pay check isn't enough. If you dont wash my clothes, I won't go to work tomorrow [3]. I tell him okay. Then dont go to work tomorrow. you have clean clothing in the closet. He says he doesn't like those clothes. I told him he needs to buy ones he likes then. He said he orders them from work. I told him he can order them then and help me out by not having to wash so much clothing every single day. 

[3 - he makes this threat of not going to work/quitting work when I ask something of him whether it be a task I need help with or talking about how I am feeling about something that happened in the relationship, or how he wronged me and it felt unresolved]

There is a pause. He asked if I was taking him to work tomorrow. I said I dont know it depends upon how i feel. He said ""cmon dont do this to me."" I said ""dont do this to you? It feels like someone is crushing my lower ribs and pushing my liver up into them and then squeezing my kidney. I dont know.""

I rest for about 45 minutes and feel a little better. I go out the room onto the balcony to smoke (i am a MMJ patient) [4] and I hear him talking as I come back in and he is talking to our daughter and got her to do the laundry. I told him he can't have our daughter do his laundry. That's not right. He can get up and do it. I tell him goodnight, I'm going to lay down on the couch and walk downstairs. 

[4 - another threat he makes is that i can't buy MMJ anymore, even though it's prescribed by my rheumatologist for my chronic pain and neuropathy]

I turn the TV way down. The light is dimmed in the room. Our son is reading on the living chair. I get comfortable on the couch in a position that doesn't hurt. He comes stomping downstairs and says ""can you move over"" while plopping right down on the couch on my feet and pushes them over. This causes me to pull my legs up in pain and causes more pain in my stomach. I start crying. He has our son turn the TV up. I cry please I just want to rest please leave me alone so I can rest. Im so tired. 

He said he is sitting there because he said i told him he has to do his laundry. I said okay and im moving around to get comfortable. I eventually fall asleep. 

He wakes me up and says he is sorry. He knows he has been mean to me today and doesnt know why. I nod and say yes and fall back asleep. He wakes me back up about 30 minutes later  He says he is really tired. I agree to just put it in the dryer for him when it's done. I just want him to stop waking me up. 

Im feeling a little better after sleeping for a little. We go upstairs to get ready for bed. He asks for me to lay with him. 

He says he is sorry that he has been treating me bad lately. He shouldn't have made me wait to take me to the hospital  And he doesn't know why  He is stressed at work and the days before he goes back he worries about staffing. He wants to make more money but not with hours at work. He wants to be a writer. He also doesn't like to be alone and with his thoughts. I told him he could research online how to be a writer and grt started next time I need to rest. He asked what kind of writer he would be good at and I said horror genre (he always talks about writing horror books). He says that I shouldn't feel bad for being sick either. We kiss and say goodnight. 

I go downstairs and finally go to sleep. This morning he wakes up like nothing happened. Im feeling well enough so I make his stuff and take him to work. Before leaving the car he says ""Im sorry again."" I say ""okay."" (I really don't know what to say to his ""I'm sorry""... it's not okay, I dont forgive him either, not yet, if ever, because I dont feel he is being genuine since he just hurts me again and again, I dont understand why he is treating me this way either. It's so confusing.) He then says... what about you? Asking for an apology for me in return. Once again, im not really sure what im apologizing for but I dont want to say something or ask something to possibly set him off again. So... I quietly say ""I'm sorry, too.""

Ive asked him to go to therapy with me. He says there is nothing wrong with him. Im the over emotional one. Im the crazy one. He thinks that going to therapy and talking about relationship problems would be ""talking bad about him"" so he ""won't let me go."" I've been thinking about making an appointment next week on a day he works but I am off for myself. I *need* to talk to a professional for my own health.

Tl;dr: I'm not crazy for thinking I am *probably* stuck in an abuse cycle... right? I have been trying to work on my physical and mental health. I have been reading a lot and am now realizing I think I've been abused all along. I have been documenting incidences from the past month+ and have seen a pattern of abuse and periods of really good loving times. ",1,1752530703.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False
1m002qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingOverSixty/comments/1m002qa/dating_apps/,Dating APPS,"    QUESTION?
    Let me begin with “I’m new without a clue”. Do all dating apps work the same? They tell you that you can use their site for free and bug the absolute crap out of you to open an account (for free, of course). While sending you profiles of supposedly single good looking people of the opposite sex.  So, you open your FREE account, fill out all the profile Information and upload a couple of pictures.
     Then you get a what they say are msgs “just for you” from prospective  suitors, which they let you read for free and even respond to for free. BUTT! From then on it costs you credits that you can purchase different package deals for certain amounts of money. I think some apps may just have set fees for different memberships levels. Both of which reach up into hundreds of dollars to actually freely communicate with another human being. So is that basically it.
      Now, International Dating Apps. Are those for really rich jet setting people with too much time and money? Why does a businessman from Venezuela, a Doctor from Brazil or a Personal Trainer from Spain want to chat for hours with some old country girl from Texas? Where’s that suppose to go? It’s not like we’re going to be planning a coffee date for next week. That will have to be a question for a whole different post. I’m just trying to get a grip on dating apps.

1m001ue,https://i.redd.it/8amejv4dxwcf1.png,Tired of wishing,"Guys, I don't know what to say. I've been on and off dating apps for a couple of years now and this time around I'm out of energy to be on the lookout consistently. Needless to say, men know how the game is different for us, AND those women that treat us like this (yes, I've grown intolerant of even mixed signals, cos that's how much volume we recieve). This screenshot is from a long time back

I feel like I've come to learn that sex is a lot more about friendship cos you just work together in the bed to make each other feel good. I first joined Bumble to find someone I can marry. Again, needless to say, I am ready to meet someone with that in mind today. However, Bumble has taught me that a date doesn't have to go bad just cos you don't think that person is for you. Heck, you can even take it to the bedroom, knowing fully well that y'all are not gonna make it as a loving couple. 

My close friend of a few years met this really hot girl who adores him sexually. She says she's down to bring another or even two into their bed. And I'm starting to think I've gotta roll my dice and play with whatever is thrown at me in return. Cos I don't wanna restrict myself to think that monogamy is all I want and all I'll hunt for

With that in mind, I'm M24 and I really got no shame to say, DM me, I'm cute. I'm sure you are, too.

If you think being adventurous in a safe space can't go wrong, let's start with a no-orthodoxy approach to both sex and love, alike

Let's see where we can go, cheers",1,1752530640.0,bumbleIndia,0,1.0,False
1m001lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m001lx/wibta_for_getting_my_roommate_to_move_out/,Wibta for getting my roommate to move out?,"I(20M) live with a few people in my apartment. There's one roommate that we all have a problem with. I'll call her shell(23F). The problems started almost immediately back in April when she lied to my friend (23F) to let her move in early. Telling my friend that her parents had kicked her out and never wanted to talk to her again. Now I know this is a lie because of 1 I've meet her mother (she seems like a nice enough lady) and 2 Shell has literally told me she got kicked out of her last place due to drug use and not cleaning. Then she had a dog, a little corgi, and this poor thing would spend all day lock in his kennel and when he was out he would have accidents and she literally never cleaned them up. This lead to her having to get rid of him, which she sold him and then used the money to buy weed and alcohol. The it continued to get worse she would never clean her room to the point of having rotting food in there( on my dishes mind you) not only that, but had her MOTHER come to help her clean. Another thing is before we ( me and my friend ) agreed to let her live with us I told her you cannot smoke in the house as I am asthmatic. I have caught her smoking in the house at least 10 times, and each time I have asked her to stop. Now my boyfriend does live with us, but that's because he got a job in the city where we go to college, I asked all of the roommates before I let him move in if it was OK. They both agreed and he moved in, me and him usually have at least one day off a week together that we use to clean the house up. She usually has at least 3 days off a week that she uses to party or something I genuinely don't know. Unfortunately I lost my grandma last week and need to go out of town for a couple days, before leaving me and my bf made sure that we cleaned all of the common areas, did the dishes (including hers that had been there for a week) swept and moved the floors, made sure that she knew i had a friend coming over to check on my dog, and that all of our Landry was done and out of the washer and dryer. As you can imagine when I got home Saturday after a very emotional day of saying goodbye to my grandma and seeing 2 strangers on my couch, mass amounts of alcohol and week on my coffee table I wasn't happy. She then flipped a breaker, this was the straw that broke the camels back. We had tried to talk to her, now we need to get someone else in so i knew i wasnt just going crazy. So me and my bf call or other roommate and tell her about everything happening, we were in the phone for an hour and a half talking about what we should do and decided that we need to tell our landlord about everything. So she sent him a text with the photographic evidence of damage to the property, in which he basically told us there us nothing he can do unless she decides to move out. Now this is where I might be the asshole and need advice. One we want to get her to move out, but she obviously doesn't mind living in a mess, me and my bf have tries a fake fight (it didn't work) so me, my bf, and my friend have no idea what to do. I genuinely can't live like this. Its putting so much stress on me and with the next semester coming up i can't do this. So reddit what do I do?",1,1752530624.0,AITAH,1,0.99,False

I’m an Aquarius (F), he’s a Pisces. We have been friends for a while, and I didn’t think much of him until after graduation, when everything shifted. Looking back, my friends always pointed out how he would gravitate toward me. Sitting next to me. Teasing me more than others. Always showing up in small but noticeable ways. I brushed it off.

After we graduated, I was the one who kept the connection going. I never planned to fall for him. I knew we wouldn’t work. Still, I did. Quietly and deeply. I showed up for him in every way I could. I gave encouragement. Helped him with things that cost me time and energy. Supported him without expecting anything in return. I just loved him. Not performatively, but completely and genuinely.

And I kept it all to myself. Because I knew that even if I loved him, he didn’t see me that way. Or if he did, it never showed in the ways that mattered.

Sometimes he would drift away. I disappear too. I understand the need for space. But with him, it always seemed to happen after I had given so much of myself. After helping him through something big, he would vanish again. Eventually I told him how much his inconsistency hurt. He said he would try to change. But by then, I had already started letting go. I began detaching. Not out of spite, but out of self-preservation.

It worked. I don’t think about him nearly as much anymore. I have space in my head and heart again. But now he’s come back around. Reaching out. Planning hangouts like nothing happened. And when we’re together, I see the softness in him again. The same presence that made me fall for him in the first place. The intense eye contact. The compliments. The warmth. He brings me small gifts and says he has so much fun, even when it’s just coffee.

And here’s what keeps me stuck. I know he treats many people like this. He is well liked. Generous. Affectionate. He is that person who lights up a room and makes everyone feel seen. So how do I know if I was ever different to him. How does someone like that show love. What does it look like when a Pisces truly sees someone as more than a friend. Because I need to understand what he looks like when he actually loves someone.

I love him. I really do. But I cannot keep loving someone who only ever saw me as a friend. So all I want to know, without asking him directly, is this. Did I ever mean something more to him? And should I finally move on?",2,1752530562.0,piscesastrology,1,1.0,False

My family just needed a change so here we are. I actually still love movie nights but we needed a biiiig break because of how my kids were behaving. I saw someone comment on another post that they would like people who do low screentime share how they do it. So, here goes... (sorry it's long)



For background: I have three boys; 5, almost 3, and 5 months old. The oldest has always been low sleep needs and HIGH energy. I suspect he has ADHD but his pediatrician won't diagnose til he is 6. My middle was a chill baby, but when he turned 2 he became just as wild as his older brother, lol. My youngest is an angel, and the easiest baby ever (knock on wood; this is what I said about my middle, lol). My husband is great and involved when he is home, but he works sometimes 12 hour days during the week but is almost always home on the weekends. I am a SAHM and my parents live an  hour away. I have a few mom friends and we live in a small town (about 2 years now). It's also summer where we are so we can get outside. I just wanted to give some context because I know everyone's cirumstances are different so how we do things may not apply for you. 

  
Anyway! My husband and I have agreed since the beginning that we wouldn't do small screens like tablets and stuff, but they definitely have used our phones to watch something at the doctors office a few times, for example. About 2 months ago, I was really relying on TV because we had a newborn. The thing was on literally almost all day because I just wanted to sit down when possible. I would turn on the TV first thing in the morning. It would be turned off sometimes throughout the day but it was pretty much on always. But I was getting so annoyed with my kids because whenever we would turn something on, it was a fight - whose turn it was, what they were going to watch, no that one, no that one, wait it's my turn! If I tried to watch something, all they would do was complain that they wanted to watch something. We loved doing movie nights on Fridays and Saturdays but we wondered if that was also affecting their sleep. It was just a mess. 

  
My oldest started getting interested in drawing, so I would find YouTube videos (supervised) that were like drawing tutorials. He would sit there for HOURS and it was awesome, but he started getting frustrated when he didn't have a video on and when I said, ""Use your imagination!"" he said, ""I don't have one!"" I was like... okay something needs to change. My husband and I decided to see how long we could go with no screentime at all, starting Monday.

  
We told the kids that it wasn't because they were in trouble, but if you watched too much TV your brain would start melting (please don't flame me for this, lmao I needed to tell them something that would make sense to them). So that first week, we only watched Shrek on Wednesday evening. Then another week passed. Then another. Now it has been 6 weeks and I think there's a difference. They are sleeping better, they are whining less, and when I tell them no it's not such an explosive fight. They are also starting to get more creative and imaginative. 

Yeah, I am pretty tired. Yes, they still fight. Yes, I am still working on my own regulation skills. But man it is NICE to not have so much background noise and stimulation. Some things we do: 

\- Play in our sunroom on the nugget couch 

\- read books (and I mean I read my own while they flip through theirs, because I have started trying to be off my phone more and model reading. The phone thing is still a work in progress. The habit is so hard to break) 

\- Magnatiles or blocks. 

\- Coloring! We have gone through so many sketchbooks this summer. 

\- We go to the park A LOT

\- Splash pad or sprinkler in the yard. 

\- They help me tidy up between tasks. 

\- They wrestle a lot or play with balls or just run full speed. We also go on walks with their bike/scooter

\- They like to help cook with me or make my coffee. As a recovering control freak, it is PAINFUL to watch them make a giant mess but I am reminding myself I am teaching them. 

  
We also allow ourselves to be bored. We have to embrace the uncomfortability of it. It was so hard at first, I'm not going to lie, but it truly has become a lot easier as time goes on. My house is a mess at the end of every day but I really think this is a productive mess. 

  
I think that some of my mom friends think I am automatically judging them when I say that we haven't been doing screentime, but I promise I'm not. I am not anti-screentime, I am anti-my-kids-are-becoming-whiny-zombies. In fact, I wish we could do more movie nights but I don't think they could handle it just yet. We have had a night where we were at a friend's house and they watched a movie there and that was fine, but then we went to my grandparent's house out of state for the fourth of July weekend and they always have their tv on so they were pretty dysregulated. But we are back on track! 

  
Anyway sorry this is so long but maybe this will be helpful for others? And again, NO JUDGMENT!! I'm just sharing. :) ",2,1752530474.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

I'm talking about Print-on-Demand (POD), and how I managed to scale my side hustle from a modest few hundred bucks to consistently hitting $3,000+ profit per month during the holiday season.
I'm not some design genius or marketing guru. I'm just a regular person who found a niche, focused on value, and put in consistent effort. The beauty of POD is that you don't hold inventory, and the risk is super low, making it perfect for anyone looking to jump in.
My ""A-Ha!"" Moment & The Simple Strategy:
I'd dabbled in POD before, but never really cracked the code for significant income. Then, last year, I realized Q4 (October, November, December) isn't just another quarter – it's a gift-giving frenzy! People are actively looking for unique, personalized items. My ""aha!"" moment was realizing I needed to lean into specific holiday-themed niches and products that screamed ""perfect gift!""
Here's how I approached it:
Deep Dive into Holiday Niches: I stopped trying to be broad and instead focused on hyper-specific holiday themes. Think beyond just ""Christmas"" to things like ""First Christmas as Mr. & Mrs."", ""Dog Mom Christmas"", ""Ugly Sweater Party"", or even niche holiday traditions. This made my designs super targeted.
The Power of Personalization: Gifts are often personal. I made sure many of my designs allowed for customization – names, dates, inside jokes. This instantly added perceived value and made my products stand out.
High-Margin, Gift-Friendly Products: While t-shirts are great, I diversified. I focused on popular Q4 gift items like:
Mugs: Always a winner for quick, affordable gifts.
Sweatshirts/Hoodies: Cozy, perfect for colder weather and holiday wear.
Ornaments: A classic holiday staple, especially personalized ones.
Tote Bags: Practical and can carry a great design.
Blankets: A bit higher ticket, but a fantastic gift item for cozy holiday vibes.
Aggressive Early Marketing: I didn't wait until December. I started pushing Halloween designs in September, Thanksgiving/Fall in October, and Christmas/Winter designs heavily from early November. This gave me a head start before the peak ad costs hit.
The Results: Holiday Cash Flow!
By focusing on these strategies, my shop saw a massive surge in sales. From averaging a few hundred dollars a month, I hit over $3,000 in profit each month throughout October, November, and December. It wasn't always easy, and there were late nights, but the payoff was incredible – especially when those holiday bills started rolling in!
Here's my step-by-step guide to tackling Q4 with POD:
Your Q4 POD Playbook: How to Make Significant Profit
This method emphasizes strategic niche selection, timely design, and effective marketing for the biggest shopping season of the year.
Step 1: Niche Down for Q4 Gold
Don't just think ""holidays."" Think specific holiday interests.
Halloween (October): Spooky puns, minimalist witch designs, funny ghost themes, specific horror movie references (if licensed or transformative). Think costumes, party wear.
Thanksgiving/Fall (October-November): ""Gobble Til You Wobble,"" ""Thankful for My Dog,"" cozy fall vibes, pumpkin spice humor, family gathering themes.
Christmas/Winter Holidays (November-December): This is the BIG one.
Family-focused: ""Our First Christmas,"" ""Matching Family Pajamas"" (design for tees/hoodies), ""Grandma's Christmas Crew.""
Pet-centric: ""Dog Dad Christmas,"" ""Meowy Christmas,"" designs featuring specific breeds.
Humor: Sarcastic holiday quotes, ""I'm on the Naughty List,"" funny gift-related designs.
Hobbies/Professionals: ""Nurse Christmas,"" ""Gamer Christmas,"" designs for specific sports fans.
New Year's Eve/Winter: ""Happy New Year,"" ""New Year, New Me"" (fitness designs), cozy winter themes.
Other Key Dates: Veteran's Day, Black Friday/Cyber Monday, Boxing Day.
Step 2: Choose High-Impact Q4 Products
Focus on items that make great gifts or are worn/used during the colder months/holidays.
Apparel: Hoodies, sweatshirts, long-sleeve tees, beanies, cozy socks.
Home Goods: Mugs (especially funny or sentimental ones), ornaments (personalized are HUGE), blankets, throw pillows.
Accessories: Tote bags, phone cases (with holiday designs).
Consider Bundles: Offer a mug and a matching t-shirt, or an ornament and a tote bag to increase average order value.
Step 3: Design for Conversion (and Trends!)
Simple & Clear: Designs that are easily understandable and impactful, especially on smaller products like ornaments.
Trendjacking (Carefully!): Keep an eye on trending memes, pop culture references, or news, but ensure they're evergreen enough for a holiday sale or you can pivot quickly.
High-Quality Mockups: Use professional mockups (Placeit is my go-to) that show the product in a lifestyle context. For Q4, think cozy home scenes, gift unwrapping, or people enjoying the holidays.
Personalization Options: If your POD platform allows, offer text customization fields. This is a massive sales driver for gifts.
Pro Tip: Canva Pro makes creating these eye-catching designs and mockups a breeze. And also to make your designs super easily ( if you want the technique to get your hands on Canva Pro account for a very cheap price and lifetime, just reach out )
Step 4: Optimize Your Listings (SEO is Your Q4 BFF)
Keyword Rich Titles: ""Funny Christmas Mug for Dog Lovers | Gifts for Pet Owners | Custom Dog Mom Coffee Cup.""
Descriptive Tags: Use all 13 tags on platforms like Etsy, mixing broad and long-tail keywords. Think about what people search for when buying gifts.
Compelling Descriptions: Highlight the gift-worthiness, quality, and potential for personalization. Mention materials and care instructions clearly.
Q4-Specific Language: Use terms like ""holiday gift,"" ""stocking stuffer,"" ""Christmas present,"" ""Black Friday deal"" in your descriptions and tags as the season progresses.
Step 5: Implement a Multi-Channel Marketing Attack
Q4 is competitive, so you need to be seen.
Pinterest: Create multiple pins for each design, using festive mockups. Link directly to your products. Pinterest is a discovery engine, and holiday shoppers are active there.
TikTok/Instagram Reels: Create short, engaging videos showing off your products. Think ""Gift ideas for [Niche],"" ""Ugly Sweater Party Outfit Inspo,"" or showing the personalization process.
Email Marketing: Start building an email list now. Offer early bird discounts, gift guides, and exclusive designs to your subscribers. Send urgent scarcity emails around Black Friday/Cyber Monday.
Paid Ads (Strategic!): If you have a budget, consider running targeted ads on Meta (Facebook/Instagram) or Pinterest. Start with small budgets to test designs, then scale up on proven winners. Target audiences interested in specific niches or holiday shopping.
Reddit (Subtly!): You're already here! Share genuine value in relevant subreddits (like this one!), and if appropriate, you can occasionally mention your products or offer advice.
Step 6: Plan Your Q4 Calendar (Important for Shipping!)
Halloween: Designs live by early September, promoted through October.
Thanksgiving/Fall: Designs live mid-September, promoted through November.
Christmas/General Winter: Designs live by early October, heavily promoted November-early December.
Know Your Deadlines: Be acutely aware of your POD provider's holiday shipping cut-off dates. Communicate these clearly on your listings and in your marketing to manage customer expectations.
Final Thoughts: Don't Sleep on Q4!
The holiday season is an absolute goldmine for Print-on-Demand. It's the time of year when people are actively looking to buy, and if you can provide unique, thoughtful, and timely designs on popular products, you're set for success. It takes work, sure, but the potential for profit is unlike any other quarter.

She’s been hospitalized a few times in the past year or so.  The doctor told us, as a family, that she is an alcoholic and needs to stop.

I’m reluctant to ask for help but 4 days of dead ends has brought me here. 

I'm hitting a wall with ComfyUI on my Mac (Apple Silicon) and hoping some of you seasoned users can offer some guidance. I'm a relative newcomer to ComfyUI, but I'm resourceful and generally pick up tech quickly. However, I've spent days trying to get anything meaningful to happen with Flux models, and it's been incredibly frustrating to watch and follow along with all these amazing YouTube demos and get nowhere. 

It seems like a lot of the flux (and comfyui in general) out there simply isn't compatible with Macs without a lot of modifications, and I keep getting led down paths that end in roadblocks. I'm using Pinokio to get ComfyUI up and running, and while that part works, getting Flux models to actually generate anything has been an exercise in futility. I've probably downloaded about 150GB of various checkpoints, LoRAs, and other files, only to constantly hit compatibility issues or see nothing pop up in the final image node and have a ton of additional things to download after lots of research. (“Oh so everything has to be Fp16, you say? Well…. I swapped all those diffusers but now it’s some other issue?!!?!)

I've even tried using ChatGPT and Gemini to help troubleshoot problems and fix elements of patches, and I've signed up for Patreon accounts hoping for support, only to find that creators aren't really responding to inquiries about why their workflows aren't working on my setup. I’ve bought coffee for 5 bucks for people online who don’t reply. 

I understand the basic node-based UI and have watched countless videos on how ComfyUI works, so I'm not entirely lost on the fundamentals. My main issue is getting workflows that actually function on a Mac.

Can anyone recommend some reliable sites or existing workflows that are known to be Mac-friendly, especially for Flux models or any other models that will work with Apple Silicon? I'm desperate to see some results and finally get past this aggravating setup phase. I'm even willing to Venmo someone some money to get me through these tough beginnings, just for the hope of seeing the final image node actually have something show up in it!

Thanks for any tips, sites, or anything. Gonna go cry in a corner for a bit.

At first we were both in relationships but eventually after we broke up with our partners , started to hook up. He said from the start he wasn’t looking for anything serious as is moving to Australia for minimum a year . I was totally fine with this but over the last few days I have had to admit to myself that I really like him . We’ve had weekends together , gone out for dinner, nights in hotels , I’ve even met his family and friends . He’s also told me he thinks I’m amazing and does things like cuddle me to sleep, give me kisses and coffee in the morning which I always associate as quite couply stuff. But maybe that’s just me? He leaves for Australia in a week and I have no plans to see him anymore as he is very busy. The other day he openly spoke about how he might meet his next girlfriend out there and I had to pretend to be happy about that when I knew deep down I had developed feelings for him. I’m really unsure on whether I confess these or not. Do I take the risk of making things awkward? I know he doesn’t feel the same so part of me just thinks what’s the point . It might just make him think I’m trying to get his attention or make him feel bad he’s been continuing to see me when I’ve been catching feelings . I’m finding myself thinking about him with other girls and getting really sad about it so I think my best option is to just stop speaking to him, let him have a great time and try and put us in the past, but would really like some other opinions .

- $200 spendings on miscellaneous (clothes, makeup, etc)
- $300 stocks or additional spending money if needed

So my sister has been seeing this guy and they became serious quickly - both looking to getting married, buying a house, travel, have kids.. I met him a couple times and he’s amazing and they look so good together, perfect fit.

Now, he said he wants both families to meet so that their relationship is formal and families know about them and their intention in getting married. Great, we set up the date and he came with his mum and older sister and her LO. Our dad passed away few years ago so we suggested that having the mum only would be a nicer approach..

My sister put a nice dress on, she looked stunning. She baked a lemon cake and even made some baklavas (we are Middle Eastern), we make borek and other pastries. We wanted to host them the best way, make them feel welcomed and comfortable.

They came and we alls at down and the mum was barely talking, was just looking down. Didn’t properly ask for our names, where we’re from, what we do for work etc just basic small talk. Nothing. My mum was the one carrying the conversation and his big sister would make efforts too, as well as him. My mum immediately liked him, they were sitting next to each other and she called her my son. She asked him questions about himself etc. His mum didn’t even look at my sister properly and even thought I was the one she was coming to meet 😑 her son had to introduce all of us again!

We offered coffee, tea, sweets and chocolate and all the cakes and pastries as per tradition. She barely ate anything “I’ve eaten before”, and kept saying things like “it’s not good to drink tea or coffee”. At some point she almost called us fat lol women in our family are curvy and we’re all average height to tall. Compared to stand we stand out more let’s say. 

She didn’t make any efforts for conversations she was too focused on her grandson. She would always interrupt my mum to call out the LO and would force him to say in her laps while the mum is right next to her. 

Like come one you came to meet your potential in laws!!

My mum at some point she said, “wow they look so good together, if they’re in love and want to be together, I’ll do anything to support them”. To which she said “do they? I think they are physically too different, I hope my son won’t put on weight” (my sister is tall and curvy).

We were all shocked.

My sisters boyfriend became red, the poor guy. He spent the afternoon telling her off with soft comments but she wouldn’t stop.

They left and we didn’t even understand what even happened?

He called my sister later to catch up and to apologise on behalf of his mum. He told her off when they got back to theirs and said that he humiliated her.

I mean what the f*ck does she think she is?

We really like the guy but don’t know what to think about the family.

At the end my mum asked for his mums number and invited them for dinner next time with the dad to which she barely reacted and her son had to repeat it and tell my mum “yes aunty I’ll take your number and send you my mums”.

I don’t Want my sister to worry but I just feel like the mum doesn’t want her son to get married or she just didn’t like us.

I don’t follow trends. I challenge them. I don't care what people think — not because I’m arrogant, but because my art isn’t up for debate. It's my vision, my grind, my expression — and I’ll use whatever tool amplifies it.

AI is not a cheat code.
It’s an extension of the imagination — a digital brush for sonic painters, a vehicle for those who hear in pictures, dream in sound, or don’t speak the language of music theory but bleed rhythm and melody. Not everyone learns or creates the same. That’s not a flaw — it’s a superpower.

I used to hesitate. Thought maybe I shouldn’t post AI-made tracks.
That people would steal. That people would hate. That gatekeepers would scream “That’s not real.”
Now? I realize that if you’re good, they can’t ignore you.
Just like business — there are a million pizza shops, clothing brands, coffee houses. But the great ones don’t worry about who else is out there. They own their lane.

So I’ll post it all. No filters. No fear. No shame.

While some people sit on pedestals judging what’s “authentic,” the real theft is happening at the top:
Platforms, labels, and corporations profiting off creators — dividing us while they quietly monetize both sides of the fight. Artists argue over purity while executives cash in on our blood, sweat, and zeros.

So I say this loud:

Let the people decide what’s quality.

Let creators create, no matter the medium.

Let go of the ego, and step into the future.


The battle isn’t Artist vs. AI.
It’s Artist + AI vs. Exploitation.
It’s Creativity vs. Control.

When you're good, you're good. The tool doesn't define the artist.
The artist defines the tool.

Most complaints/criticisms of the book appear to follow in these 4 categories:

* Rothfuss still hasn't finished ""The Door of Stone"" (the third and last book of KKC) for several years and as a result, fans have become *really* frustrated with him because of it, a very similar situation to George R.R. Martin and Game of Thrones. This only got worse after the charity donation controversy in which Rothfuss failed to deliver on his promise to release a new chapter from ""Stone"".
* Kvothe is a glorified ""Mary Sue"", wish-fulfillment self-insert for the reader that die hard fans justify by claiming he's an unreliable narrator when he's actually not.
* Some accusations of sexism due to the absence of well-rounded female characters and/or womanizing character traits of male characters.
* Overreliance on purple prose at the expense of character development and relevant plot points.

Now, to be clear, I don't agree with all of the statements above. So far, I've been enjoying it pretty thoroughly and a stranger at a coffee shop I usually hang out at was even pleasantly surprised when she noticed my copy I brought along with me, so NothM may not be as divisive in the real world.

The 2025 travel credit card market is buzzing with innovation! Three standout cards—**Chase Sapphire Preferred**, **American Express Gold**, and **Capital One Venture**—are reshaping how travelers earn and redeem rewards. Let’s dive into the trends, strategies, and tips to help you choose the best fit for your lifestyle.

# 🌍 Market Trends in 2025

1. **Points Boost Flexibility**: Chase’s new *Points Boost* system (post-June 23, 2025) lets you redeem points at **1.5–1.75 cents each** for select flights and premium cabin upgrades. This replaces the flat 1.25 cents rate, rewarding strategic booking.
2. **Dining Dominance**: Cards like AmEx Gold are doubling down on food rewards, with **4x points on restaurants and U.S. groceries**—perfect for foodies but not ideal for casual eaters.
3. **Simplified Redemption**: Capital One’s Venture cards are gaining traction for their **1:1 redemption value** (1 cent per mile) and **no airline/hotel restrictions**, making rewards accessible for all travelers.

# 💳 Card-Specific Strategies

# 1. Chase Sapphire Preferred

* **Best For**: Travelers who book through Chase’s portal or transfer points to U.S. airlines/hotels (United, Southwest, Marriott, Hyatt).
* **Key Benefits**:
   * **75,000 bonus points** after $5K in 3 months (worth $937.50–$1,312.50 depending on Points Boost).
   * **Triple points on travel and dining** (plus 10% anniversary bonus on all purchases).
   * **$50 annual hotel credit** (cuts the $95 fee in half if used).
* **Optimization Tip**: Prioritize **Points Boost bookings** for premium tickets and hotels to maximize value. Transfer points to U.S. partners to avoid foreign transfer fees.

# 2. American Express Gold

* **Best For**: High spenders at **restaurants and U.S. supermarkets**, especially in cities with strong dining scenes.
* **Key Benefits**:
   * **4x points on dining (up to $50K/year)** and **4x on U.S. groceries (up to $25K/year)**.
   * **$120 annual dining credits** (Uber Eats, Grubhub, etc.).
   * **Transfer points to luxury airlines** (British Airways, Emirates) for elite status.
* **Optimization Tip**: Use the **dining credits to offset the $325 fee**. Avoid transferring to U.S. airlines due to the **$0.0006/point fee** (max $99).

# 3. Capital One Venture

* **Best For**: Travelers who want **simplicity** and **unrestricted redemptions**.
* **Key Benefits**:
   * **2x miles on all purchases** (no categories to track).
   * **75,000-mile sign-up bonus** after $4K in 3 months.
   * **$200 annual travel credit** for TSA PreCheck/Global Entry.
* **Optimization Tip**: Use miles for **statement credits** (1 cent value) or transfer to **international partners** like Air France Flying Blue (1:1 ratio).

# 🚀 Actionable Advice for 2025

* **Chase Sapphire Preferred**:
   * **Ideal for** those who value **transfer flexibility** and **Points Boost**.
   * **Pro Tip**: Pair with the **Sapphire Reserve** to access higher-tier rewards and lounge access.
* **American Express Gold**:
   * **Ideal for** foodies and families who spend **$50K+ annually** on dining/groceries.
   * **Pro Tip**: Use dining credits for **local favorites** (e.g., sushi spots, coffee chains) to offset the fee.
* **Capital One Venture**:
   * **Ideal for** travelers who want **no-hassle rewards** and a **$200 travel credit**.
   * **Pro Tip**: Consider the **Venture X** if you need elite transfer partners (e.g., United, JetBlue) and higher spending capacity.

# 📊 Final Takeaway

* **Chase Sapphire Preferred** wins for **versatility** and **U.S.-centric transfers**.
* **AmEx Gold** thrives for **dining and grocery enthusiasts**—but requires heavy spending.
* **Capital One Venture** is the **simplifier’s dream** with **unrestricted redemptions** and a **starter-friendly bonus**.

1lzz9y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1lzz9y5/binging_on_beverages_as_well_not_alcohol/,Binging on Beverages as well? [Not Alcohol],"Hey all. I'm trying some strategies to combat BED but I've noticed something I wanted some thoughts on. Sorry if this is a weird or confusing question or better suited for a doctor. 

One thing I have caught myself struggling with quite often is I feel like I'm binging on beverages as well. Whether it's my morning and afternoon coffee, a smoothie I made, or even just my water. It's like whatever my beverage I have with me, I feel the need to constantly be drinking it EVEN IF I don't feel thirsty. (Big emphasis on that part, I feel that's the key detail here separating this from dehydration.) Especially if I have a sweeter drink I just CRAVE it frequently and wanna down it so fast even though I'm trying to make it last over time. I usually end up consuming well above 64 ounces of water and often have at least 16 or more ounces of coffee. 

My question to you all is, is this also considered a symptom of BED? Or is it more likely just dehydration? I've tried looking into it but all that comes up are concerns about binge drinking alcohol specifically or just dehydration being caused by medical conditions and/or medication side effects. And I'm definitely willing to say it could be just the caffeine and my medicines I'm on dehydrating me. But the constant craving even if I'm not feeling thirsty has me quite curious if this is actually related to BED. Thanks for letting me throw this one out there and for your thoughts.

I was a happy-go-lucky guy before and during I started dating my ex GF now 28 y/o, I am not perfect, I know that much, but I always see the world as glass half full most of the time (explanation later). As a preface, I used to work with my ex and I was her boss (kinda…) I courted her for 4 months and met her family within 5 months. We were not the perfect couple, but our friends called our relationship to be something be aspired. 

We dated for almost 6 years. We ended up living together after a year of dating. (She urged me to move in). I used to live with my best friend but she was not at all in line with him, but  she did get along well with his gf. It seemed perfect at first, until we had our first fight because of my depression (explanation from above). I am the kind of guy that when I’m angry or stressed, I keep quiet. In my mind, I do not want to say something impulsive that I most likely regret. But her on the other hand, she prefers to talk things out. In retrospect, I do agree with her. But, I was stupid and still young, so instead of talking things through, I decided to let her words fall on deaf ears and went drinking with friends. I took pictures as well as to remind myself that sadness can be resolved by burying the sadness and smile and grin. I know it’s not the healthiest thing, but it worked for me back then. She then left me a message that “we need to talk” my gut was turning and called me and said she wants to break up. She told me that she called my best friend’s gf and vent all her “frustrations” with me. My best friend’s gf told her “oh, he’s 99% making out with a girl, it’s a bar ffs!” I found this out after we talked in person because she told me she has depression as well. She told me that it pains her to see me vent out to someone other than her. In my mind, it didn’t make sense: why would I burden her more with depression if she has hers as well? I’m not that kind of person. As much as possible, I don’t like to be a nuisance on people. We made up by talking and compromising with each other’s feelings. I told her that I’ll try my best to talk if I’m feeling depressed or stressed. I told her to do the same. I tried to be the perfect bf, even with my flaws like being a manchild at times. She told me that the previous guy she dated broke her heart that she needs to keep her walls up most of the time. I told her to let me in, so I can understand her, but only when she is ready. We moved in together after all has been resolved.

The next 3 years were full of joy, the “honeymoon phase”. Until, I stupidly messaged a male cornstar that I was a huge fan. (Oh yeah, I’m bisexual, and closeted because of the fear people will judge me.) she saw the message and told me “why? What did I ever do to you?” I confessed and came out to her. We made out again and ask me “don’t lie anymore!” I promised myself to do even better. 

She did tell me a few weeks after that she had an ex who was a woman as well, which by then told me that she was bisexual too. She told me in detail what they did, and got me hot and bothered. We had the best sex (at least for me). I felt great because I thought we are moving in the right direction and moving past the bisexual issue. We had a dog together, and her brother moved in with us due to some personal reasons. I was okay with it. Both of us just acknowledge each other. Nothing more, nothing less. 

Then at the 4th year of our relationship; I graduated from school and got a job. I was at work most days of the week. We did fight every now and again, but always made up. I supported her. Then she got an idea that she’ll go back to school too, so we can save more money for our future. I proposed to her and was the happiest man when she said yes. We were about to plan a wedding but COVID happened. I was an essential worker so I really can’t abandon my job, plus it makes an exceptionally more money compared to the quarantine aide government provided.

4 months prior to our 6th anniversary, we got a gaming PC. For both of us to use.

As a preface, I am an animé weeb and a gamer. She was only an rpg gamer. I did try to convert her to being a weeb like me, because I want her to enjoy the amazing stories that animé provides. Alas, she told me that “it’s childish, it’s cartoons!” That irked me a bit, but I loved her so much that I brushed it off.

Back to the story, she used the gaming PC more than I do because I am almost always working and she has time because it was COVID era and all her classes in school turned into online classes. I was fine with it. I’d go by the motto “happy wife happy life” 

She would do classes during the day then schoolwork in the afternoon, then game all night with her online friends where she was “momma” in their gaming clan. I jokingly said, can I join the clan and be the daddy? She laughed, but never responded. I was weirded out. I was reading a book, when she said she needed to use the bathroom with her clan. I sneakily peeked in the discord chat and saw that others calling her momma and others calling another guy dad. I had another gut feeling, twisting and my head was getting warm. But stupidly, I did not ask her, and pretended to not notice it and went back to the book I was reading. I was thinking that maybe I was paranoid, it’s been almost 6 years. I trust her enough. But I feel like COVID had taken a toll in my depression, with the quarantine and work. I confronted her that she didn’t have anytime for me. While I work my butt off, she was playing games and forgets housework and no food prepared. (I know it sounds mysoginistic, but I unfortunately work 12hours/day) I do my part when I have my days off, I was just frustrated that I would sometimes go to bed tired and hungry.

I got more and more frustrated and depressed, then one day, she started watching an animé and a tv show I told her to watch with me because I love the show. She was watching it with her friends and screen shared it with them, kinda like a watch party. I was furious and started to sleep in a different bedroom. She tried her best to apologize without uttering the words “I’m sorry” I kept my distance and gave her the silent treatment over and over until I can regulate my anger and frustrations and ultimately talk to her in a better mood to prevent any impulsive words that can come out of my mouth. But I did promise her to try my best to communicate when I’m feeling sad or angry, that was my mistake. I effed this up.

I finally talked to her about her habits and I know that being quarantined has gotten to her as well. But, we need to formulate a plan where both of us can work on to prevent this from falling out. We did, and started moving back to the bed with her. Unfortunately, old habits die hard. She went back to her routine: PC from morning until we sleep. We haven’t had sex in almost a year. I know sex isn’t the requirement to stay in a relationship, but for me, sex is more of a form of expression to relay that you love someone. I tried to rectify it by looking up honeymoon packages and showing it to her, but she would immediately snub it and tell me annoyingly“Look, I still have school, let me graduate first and look for a job first!” I felt stupid for not understanding it during the time.

I feel like I’m alone in the relationship, I agree I’m a narcissistic A-hole for saying this, but back when I was in school, I would turn down hanging out with friends because I would tell them it’s girlfriend night. My friends would envy me because of that. I was just wondering why couldn’t she do that for me?

I angrily made a letter to break up with her. And left it on the coffee table in our living room and left for work, it was a sign for me: if she read it, It’s over. If she hasn’t and remained glued to the gaming chair, I would vent out all my frustrations and pain verbally to her face. She did read it, and told me to take my time to find a place. That I can sleep in the guest bedroom for now. Eyes dry, face serious. Then went back to play her games in the PC like nothing happened.

A few days later, I had ‘Clarity’ and told her I made a mistake in breaking up with her. I swallowed my pride and told her to give me another chance, that if I need to go back from square one, I’d do it, and prove to her that this time, I’m serious, no more games. We made up… for the last time. But for now, she told me she wanted to be friends for now, she stopped calling me ‘babe’ and called me by my name, it was weird at first, but I was determined to get her back, because I loved her. I proposed to her. Weirdly enough we started having sex again. Almost every other day. She then told me that she’ll get an IUD. I was excited because… (I’m not explaining why) she then told me “yes, and also it’s for my hormonal problem” I drive her to the doctors. Everything seems to be going in the right direction again, we’re back to the honeymoon phase. I invited my friends and their gf over for pyjama games night. We all had fun, for the first time since COVID, everything felt normal. Everything felt warm and nice.

5 days before Christmas, she told me that she needs our car for 4 days. December 22,23,24,25. She told me that it’s best to spend Christmas with her lonely friend. I was angry at first. I told her why would you just not invite her here? I have work, and need the car. And also confronted her because she is afraid of driving during winter. She told me “well, we had new winter tires, I should be fine!” I told her fine. But she better be back by Christmas because I will have her present by then (she does not like surprises so I asked her what she wanted and bought it a month in advance). She said “fine, I’ll be back by then” I took the bus and train to get to work and back in the cold winter for 2 of those days. I wrapped her present and made some of my famous holiday chicken she loves. She got back home and kissed her and told her Merry Christmas. I gave her present, but she replied “Can you just return it? I didn’t get you any present anyway, so it’s fair” I got frustrated. And told her, she didn’t have to give me a present, just take it and just say thank you. I told her to eat because I made her favourite and went back to the guest bedroom. She asked me to eat with her, I told her I’m not hungry anymore. After she ate, she talked to me and said “sorry, I was just thinking that it was not fair for you, I didn’t get you anything” i just shrugged my shoulder pretended to fall asleep and told her, I have an early shift tomorrow. She then told me that after my work we’ll go return the gift and pick out a gift that both of us can use instead. I complied and slept.

On the day of our break-up. Any guy’s nightmare came into reality. As soon as I got in my car, a hotel receipt was on the floor by the passenger side, the name on it was the same name I saw in the discord chat. The dates matched up from the 4 days she was put of the house. My heart sank, but it’s too late to call in a PTO off work. I went to work all stressed and a bit snarky. As soon as I got home, I confronted her. She denied it, she told me it was a friend. Told me to ask her friend to confirm where she slept. I called my sister and she picked me up immediately, i gathered all my stuff and left. I left her with the car and the apartment (along with the payments for it). I had a breakdown and yelled at her. She told me “Your mom and dad didn’t show you how to properly love someone, so why would I expect you to” I completely got furious and told her that the IUD, was not for my benefit then? I told her that, she watched Frieren (an animé) just because a guy told you to watch it? I returned the question she asked me back then: “why? What did I ever do to you?” She just replied, “just get your stuff and go” I stayed with my sister’s for a few days until I can find a new place to stay. My brother helped me financially, so I’m grateful for my sibling’s support both financially and emotionally. What she said was true though, my parents were never emotionally available. They were either caught up in their own emotions and shortcomings.  It just hurts more when she used my own source of darkness that I told her in confidence against me. I guess hurt people hurt people. 

I wish for karma to slap her so hard for giving me this emotional trauma. Sometimes I’d have thoughts of fantasies wherein she gets STD’s or a guy breaks her heart. Is that wrong? Now, when I go on dates I turn suspicious all the time, I feel like guys and girls have a hard time getting to know me. The once glass half-full guy, has turned into glass always empty guy.

I apologize for this long thread, I just need some advice or someone to tell me if I’m wrong or right. It felt kinda nice to vent this all out to. Even if it’s wrong, It felt great to put all this big feelings out.",1,1752528802.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.67,False

We were good friends, but not ""besties"". She moved 800 miles away about ten years ago. It happened to be about two hours from a family member. 

I kept in touch with phone calls, texts and would visit her whenever I was in that area- once a year or so. We always stayed connected, had fun and laughed and reminisced about our kids etc. 

She never had to work outside the home, but I did to support my kids etc. I made sure to make time for she and I to meet up for coffee over the many years of our friendship. 

We always celebrated our birthdays together, send cards for special occasions, went to dinner occasionally with our spouses. 

Four years ago she stopped responding to my calls and texts. I reached out through FB to her DIL asking if she was ok. She said she was fine (?) 

I gave up and deleted her from my phone and mind. During that time I went thru covid, job loss, pet loss, illnesses and more. I could have used a friend. 

About a month ago I get a text message that turned out to be from her. Not apologizing, but saying she missed our friendship, conversations etc. That she had been experiencing family problems when she stopped communication. Asked if we could get back in touch. I said of course! We set up a time to talk. 

We spoke, she talked about all the great things happening in her life, how seemingly perfect it was etc. She asked what had been going on with me, I hesitated to answer. I then asked why she ghosted me. Turns out she was mad I had not responded to an invitation she had sent me for a party. (So nothing to do with what she said in her text)I probably had said I would love to attend to be polite.  But knowing I wouldn't be driving 800 miles for a party with people I do not know. 

Also the invite came when my dog was dying and I thought I was losing my job etc. So I missed the RSVP. I know, rude. 

We left the conversation, and a couple of days later she sent pictures of a very expensive hobby she and her husband have. I wasn't sure how to respond.

Now I'm seeing this friendship in a new light. It was clearly a surface friendship. 

Sorry this is so long. I just don't know if it's worth rekindling this. She held a grudge for four years!

Intern ID: Reynolds, J. (Yes, I’m still here. No, I don’t know why.)



So after Project Felis (a.k.a. ""Why We Don’t Make Cat-Soldiers Because They’re Furry Sociopaths""), you’d think we—the extremely underpaid, underappreciated, and often traumatized lab interns—would have learned our lesson about trying to make animal-based humanoid soldiers.

We did not.

Why? Because some higher-up watched Guardians of the Galaxy, got starry-eyed, and decided Rocket Raccoon was the perfect prototype for our next attempt.

Phase One: The Justification (a.k.a. The Lies We Told Ourselves)

The logic was technically sound (and by ""technically,"" I mean ""written by people who have never met a raccoon""). The proposal went something like this:

✔ Raccoons are highly intelligent, capable of tool use and problem-solving.

✔ They have opposable thumbs, making them better suited for humanoid combat roles.

✔ They have a low center of gravity, making them harder to knock over.

✔ They are natural scavengers, perfect for battlefield adaptability.

✔ They are cunning and resourceful, perfect for espionage.

Here’s what the proposal DIDN’T mention:

❌ Raccoons are chaotic little demons with no respect for law, order, or human suffering.

❌ They steal everything that isn’t nailed down. (And some things that are.)

❌ They hold grudges and will go out of their way to inconvenience you.

❌ They don’t just adapt—they cause problems on purpose to see what happens.

But nobody listened to the interns, so Project Procyon was greenlit.

Phase Two: The Prototype (a.k.a. The Regret)

So we made one. One singular humanoid raccoon soldier, because after the cat disaster, leadership was wary about mass production. (Smart. For once.)

His designation was 001-P, but we called him Bandit. That was mistake #1.

At first, Bandit seemed… promising. He was shockingly intelligent, quickly picking up human speech, understanding complex systems, and bypassing security measures he wasn’t supposed to know about.

That last part should’ve been a red flag. It was not.



Phase Three: The Problem (Which Was Bandit)

1. The Unquenchable Need to Steal

Bandit stole everything. Weapons, ID cards, food, research documents, an entire prosthetic leg from a visiting general.

We found a stash hidden behind the ceiling tiles in Lab 4, including:

Four sidearms

A set of handcuffs

Two wallets (we still don’t know whose)

A flash drive containing top-secret clearance codes

A whole-ass security camera that he somehow detached from the wall

Every time someone asked him where something went, he’d grin, lie, and produce a completely unrelated item instead.

""Hey Bandit, have you seen my tablet?""

""I have this banana.""

""That’s not—where did you even get that?""

""Trade?""

2. The Compulsion to Create Problems

Bandit lived for chaos.

He figured out how to unlock the lab doors remotely and let out an entire wing of experimental combat drones ""for fun.""

He reprogrammed a training sim to add flamethrowers ""because it was boring.""

He convinced a new recruit to ""go press that big red button and see what happens."" (The button activated a missile defense test. Indoors.)

And the worst part? Every time we tried to discipline him, he looked amused.

3. The Grudge Holding

One time, a researcher denied Bandit an extra snack. A normal animal would pout and move on.

Bandit? No.

He waited. For three weeks.

Then, one hour before the researcher’s big presentation, he stole all her notes and left a single shredded page in her coffee cup.

Security footage caught him watching from the rafters while she panicked. He was eating popcorn.



Phase Four: The ""Final Straw"" (a.k.a. Why We Shut This Down)

The breaking point was The Great Explosion Incident.

We don’t know exactly how it happened, but here’s what we pieced together:

Bandit stole a scientist’s ID badge.

Bandit broke into the restricted armory.

Bandit acquired C-4. (I wish I was kidding.)

Bandit attached it to a vending machine.

Bandit detonated it.

When questioned, he claimed it was a ""science experiment.""

""You blew up the vending machine.""

""Hypothesis confirmed: candy does not survive explosives.""

""That’s not—why?!""

""I wanted a Snickers.""



Phase Five: Immediate Termination of Project Procyon

After several hours of trying to explain to the general why a raccoon had access to military-grade explosives, Project Procyon was canceled immediately.

The official report cited:

""Severe unpredictability""

""High risk of unauthorized munitions acquisition""

""Refusal to follow orders unless bribed with snacks""

Unofficially? The higher-ups were afraid Bandit would unionize.

Where is Bandit Now?

Great question. We don’t know.

After the program shut down, security was supposed to transfer him to a containment facility. But when they arrived, all they found was:

An unlocked cage

A note reading ""Catch me if you can""

A stolen keycard from the base commander

To this day, nobody knows where Bandit went.

But sometimes, when an officer loses something important… when a vending machine malfunctions suspiciously… when a security camera goes missing…

We wonder.

At the Nespresso store near me a few months ago, an employee hinted that it was a possibility. 
But this is a big deal for me as I am straight up refusing to upgrade my machine atm....

I'll explain.

My first machine (purchased 2022) was the vertuo plus. It was near PERFECT. I loved that machine so damn much!!!! The closing mechanism with the button was AWESOME. 
Fast forward a couple years....I really had been wanting larger coffees sometimes. Only downfall of VP machine, no large pod compatibility. 

So I """"""""upgraded"""""""" (lol**) to the Vertuo Next. 
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

I hate this machine. I hate the way it closes. I hate having to force it closed awkwardly and turn and all that. It feels like garbage and like I'm working as an underpaid barista.... I didn't buy the damn stupid machine to have to work for it to have coffee 🤬

I love that it brews larger pods, but I've decided I don't care enough about them for that to be the deal maker for me. I will happily go back to only smaller (double espresso) pods in exchange for a button again.

I've been wanting to specifically upgrade to the vertuo creatista. It fits my needs because of the milk situation. I am huge latte drinker and the milk addition to the machine is worth it for me.
I currently (for the last 4 years) heat my oat milk up in the microwave and it's a pain and I make a huge mess and it just sucks.
(BTW, I've tried the milk frothing/heating machines, they always break for me)

 So I'm waiting out for a Creatista machine that has the auto button closure like the vertuo plus did. Otherwise, zero point in ""upgrading"" to another machine I will hate because of the way it closes.

Let it be theirs. Not everything needs to be carried or solved. Sometimes people show you exactly who they are. You get to decide it’s not your job to hold it.

Make your space feel safe. Clean it. Light a candle. Play music that feels like a reset. Your environment matters when you’re trying to start over.

Stop explaining yourself to people committed to misunderstanding you. Silence is powerful. Not everything needs your side of the story.

Move your body. Walk, stretch, dance, even jusst breathe deeper. Stuck emotions need movement to shift.

Give yourself permission to not be okay yet. Healing isn’t a performance. You don’t have to look graceful doing it.

Find small things to look forward to. A cup of coffee, a walk in the sun, fresh bedsheets. Let tiny joys remind you life is still happening.

Decide you get to have a good life anyway. Even if they never apologise. Even if you never get closure. You still get to feel light again.


Healing isn’t a neat checklist or some boring glow up. It’s messy, wild, and real as hell. But it’s also you grabbing your power back, flipping the script, and saying, “you don’t get to define me.” It’s showing up for yourself with full force even on the rough days and choosing every damn day to rise higher. Healing means you get to create a life that feels electric and full of magic. No permission needed. You’re already whole, just getting louder with it.

For the most part we agree on furniture and decor. We were putting together a coffee bar (SEE PICTURE 3) and we have a lot of art so I thought to add some dimension (if that’s what you call it) and add this mirror as seen in the photos. My boyfriend HATES it. Not the mirror (we will move it to the front door) but the positioning and says that it really doesn’t fit with the coffee station. He wants to add open shelving above it. I am against the open shelving because we have an open shelf across from it as you can see and I feel we both want less of a cluttered look which open shelving sometimes feels like to me. Finally we both agree we have too many paintings and it would feel overloaded with another painting but with nothing the wall looks bare and boring. What other kind of wall decor is there or you would recommend that’s not a mirror, painting or shelving? Please help lol.

My mom has hypothyroidism. I suspect I have something but thyroid labs always look in normal range.

I exercise 4 times a week between pilates, weights, cardio. I have a background in professional sports and even then I was heavier than everyone else. I’m tired of ppl mansplaining basic diets and workouts, I’ve literally tried so many things and nothing seems to truly help. 
I don’t go too excessive but I do proper workouts.
I don’t drink, don’t smoke, no drugs. I eat very moderate, glutenfree, dairy free and low histamine. if I track it’s never more than 1700 calories and if I cheat, it’s always in modesty.

Im m 28 and was diagnosed when I was 25 or 26, since then I lost weight initially 10kg but then put like 20 kg on due to a breakup and bad mental health.

I ignored my liver because I didnt care what happened to me and recently I've been trying to get it back to normal.

August 2024 is when I had my last blood test this produced slightly lower results than 2023 so silver lining I guess.

Alanine aminotransfer level 64 - should be below 39.

GGT 76 should be below 39

Serum globulin level 28 - should be between 30 35

Since then bad news is i was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis...good news its only procitis so so far its very minimal and hardly have to take anything for it.

Since January I've gone from 115kg down to now 107.50 not a great deal doesn't feel like it at least. But better than nothing.

I've gained more muscle and improved stamina a bit but doesnr help I have a office job and snack easily.

Today I eat fairly good I mean I say that I had a white bap with sausage and egg in it and processed egg, black coffee (small win)

Lunch i had wholemeal sandwhich with salad and tuna but also had doritos and a bit of chocolate.

Then I had a protein shake for late early dinner, was a low sugar low fat high protein one, I used oat milk which was better than normal milk. ( I try to substitute for slightly better things)

Then thr hunger kicked in at 7 pm...I resisted i knew I didnt need the calories. 9 pm I ordered a fucking pizza and garlic bread. Eat the lot. I just tried to throw it up because I was scared this would be the meal that scars my liver, I got some of it up but my stomach started to hurt, so I stopped :/

I manage a few days really good eating then I relapse or ill have one treat like a ice cream at the cinema but then it snowballs.

Im scared that even if I lose more weight, my goal is to get to 90kg at least, im scared ill get a fibroscan and a blood test in 6 months and it will be too late, that ill have chirasosis .

When I last got scanned two years ago it was like grade 1 very early but if I've ignored it mostly surely im screwed :(

I dont want to have to get a liver transplant but im scared the pizza or one off treat will tip me over the edge, or days like today.

Im sorry for the rant but im scared and feel like its too late, I know only I can fix this and I know it can get a lot worse if I dont beat this...does anyone have success stories of a severe turn around? Or am I really screwed.

Im sat here and feel so angry and annoyed that I eat that carb heavy pizza. Before that my liver didnt feel inflamed, but now sat here I can feel that its swollen more. Why is this so hard to beat the cravings are horrible, any tips to stop un healthy snacking and also good snacks to chew on please id love to know.

When im on track I tend to stick to wholemeal bread with Avocado's, eggs poached, protein shakes, trying to have natural yogurt with blueberries raspberries etc, more fish, prawns, salmon and only chicken.

If anyone has good batch cooking recipes id love to know as I find Broccoli rice chicken boring 

I hate that my bad mental health caused me to overest to the point I got so fat, I feel ill never get better :(

I like to tag all of my stories with a (Primary / Secondary / Tertiary) theme, and this one is (Paganism / Family / Corpse).

Stay spooky!

\---

*Of course*.

If my father were going to leave me the house, of course, he’d leave his stain on it. In this situation, the stain was literal, ash black cement in the centre of the basement marking where he took his last gurgling breath. The sickly-sweet smell of him lingered. The single air freshener I had packed wouldn’t do, and I’d have to go into town eventually, no matter how much I dreaded it.  

The basement had been the first place I checked. I ended a call with my older brother, one of my many relatives who thought they were more deserving of the house, as I made my way down the plank wood stairs.

Now looking at the burnt smear in the centre of the room, too deeply marked for even the local cleaner to scrub away, I imagined I was the only one of my family who could stomach it.

I would have to find a rug to cover it up, and I hoped that there was a spare somewhere in the house. If not, it’d be an hour driving into the nearest non-hick town to try and find one, and I’d done enough driving for today.

*This part of my father would have to stay in the house*. *For now*.

The rest of the house lifted my spirits. The familiar birdsong greeted me as I crested the stairs. Some of the only fond memories of my childhood were accompanied by those noises.

Dark mahogany floorboards and bookshelf walls in every room. What was contained in the books I couldn’t tell, recognizing some more recent purchases, but with the majority being in other languages, I did not know. The smell of old books and their leather-bound covers was enough for me.

The fireplace sat squat on the wall opposingly.  So close to the musty kindling surrounding it. I probably wouldn’t be lighting any fires for a bit anyway. It would seem in poor taste, no matter how I felt.

The family home seemed right out of a movie set in the Victorian Age. From outside, the crimson panelling and gray rooftop meant the building looked best when under a gloom. The large, rounded turret at the corner of the manor, stretching a story higher into the sky and tipped with a pointed spike, only accentuated this feeling.

And despite all that, and even though I had not seen it in seventeen years, I felt more comfortable than I had ever been in it before. With only myself.

My phone rang again, ripping me out of my moment of peace.

“Hey sis—“

“What the actual fuck Thomas,” Emma snapped, cutting me off.

Honestly, that was better than the insults or threats I had been receiving from the others.

“I know none of us were close, but I at least sent cards. You never reached out, not once.”

“I don’t think birthday cards qualify you for real estate, Emma,” I said, sharper than I meant it to be.

“Thomas.”

To be fair, I didn’t have an answer for her.

“I honestly don’t know Emma,” I sighed, pacing through the house. “Maybe, it was one last middle finger to us. Maybe he grew a heart. Or maybe he just picked me right before lighting himself on fire. Whichever it is, I don’t know.”

“So, what’re you going to do with the place?” she asked. “If you’re planning on giving it up, at least give me first dibs.”

“Will do, sis.” I had made my way to the kitchen window that looked into the backyard. “I have some stuff I have to figure out first.”

I looked out the window. The fresh patch of dirt at the far end of the yard had my attention, and I flashed it the finger.

*Why me?*

*\*\*\**

Unpacking came next. I hadn’t brought too much, just the essentials, but even that took me the rest of the afternoon. My speaker comforted me, with the screaming and strumming of the bass guitar keeping me company. Still, it had taken me well into dusk to get it in a state that I could fall asleep with.

Turning down the music to prepare myself for bed, I heard it. Knocking. I didn’t know if I just hadn’t heard it before or if it had begun as I lowered the volume, but there was someone knocking on the front door. I checked the clock quickly: 8:47 pm.

It was gentle, polite despite the hour. After two minutes of its persistence, I realized whoever was out there wasn’t going to be leaving on their own. They had heard the music. They knew I was home. Maybe they were coming to give a noise complaint.

Whatever. It would take five minutes to sort out. Teary-eyed grief or a smile and a chuckle of misunderstanding would keep it short. I strode towards the door, preparing, and realized the lack of a peephole. In fact, there weren’t any windows around the door. The thick lacquered door obscured everything about who was on the other side. I would have to open it to check.

Crocodile tears on the edge of my eyes, I opened the door.

“Oh,” was all that she said at first. She hadn’t expected me to answer. Maybe not like that. Her wrinkled hand was still awkwardly raised at the door, holding something made from sticks. The other held a Tupperware container with what looked like lasagna inside.  

There were two of them,

The woman, dressed in a knit sweater, was stood right at the door. So close that I almost bumped into her.

The man, whom I assumed was her husband, was further back. Staying off the porch, down the steps, looking off at something further down the dark road.

“How can I help you?” I asked, wiping my eyes.

“Sorry to intrude,” she started. Her tone was gentle; I imagined in hopes of comforting me. “I’m Linda, and this is my husband, Paul,” gesturing at the man further down the stairs.

I realized this would take a bit longer. “Is there anything I can do for you?” I asked. “Was the music too loud? I’m done for the night anyway.”

“Nothing of the sort. We just wanted to do our neighbourly duty and introduce ourselves.”

“Well, it’s appreciated, thank you,” I said. Food was another thing that I would have to go into town for. I waited for Linda to hand over the lasagna, but she didn’t.

“You don’t look like how I expected. Nothing like your father.”

The dyed black hair and piercings helped that.

Her husband, Paul, finally spoke. “Be respectful, Linda. He’s a McCrae, no matter how he looks.” His eyes were still focused elsewhere.

“No offence taken,” I said with a smile. If anything, what Paul said was worse.

“Apologies, Thomas. Paul’s right, you’re to be respected. In any case, here you go,” she said, handing over the lasagna and the strange bundle of sticks. “Do with it what should be done.”

After a few more long minutes of pleasantries, Linda turned, and the two of them made their way back down the rural road in the direction of what I assumed was their home.

Inspecting the sticks, I saw that it was intertwined with vines. Hair woven in. A bird, maybe? I had no idea what was to be done with the thing. I also realized I didn’t remember ever introducing myself to Linda.

\*\*\*

The couch wasn’t comfortable, but it had been the only option. Anything that could generously be considered my room was repurposed, and my father’s master bedroom was out of the question. So, the couch it had been.

I made myself a coffee and started to plan the day. Town was inevitable. There was a handful of things I would need if I had any intention of staying here, and I had just eaten through the last of my meager rations. The inevitability of speaking with a local was also very real, and if Linda, Paul, and my faint memories were anything to go on, I wasn’t enthused.

The question of how long I could survive if I never left the house flittered to my mind. If the water worked, surely, I could get past the first few days. Food would be another issue, but I’d been resourceful in the past. Other than that, what else? Shelter was easy. Warmth was easy. Social Interaction?

It was stupid. The deeper question was how long until I’d have to interact with people like my father. *In a perfect world, never*, I thought. Still, I grabbed my car keys and locked the door behind me. It was a nice thought.

Calling it a town was generous. The most interesting building was a crafts store, its exterior adorned with birdhouses and other handcrafted knick-knacks. Other than that, the place sucked. There was no church, no cemetery, no history. Thankfully, there was a liquor store because, of course, there was.

The gas station doubled as a general store simply called Clark’s. It supplied the residents with the necessities, and now that I technically fell under that description, it would do the same for me.

The middle-aged cashier, whom I assumed was The Clark, lit up seeing me.

“Thomas McCrae! An honour”

*Was this going to be a thing?*

“Nice to meet you, too,” I said, walking through the store. Trying to pick out what I needed, Clark took my silence as an invitation to speak.

“I think it’s a damn good thing. You coming here.  Not the store I mean, the town,” he said, laughing. I meanwhile focused on the fact that the candles were tucked at the back of the shelf, having not been restocked.

“Your father was a great man. Big shoes to fill, I reckon. It’s a tragedy what happened to him, but that’s the life of people in his position. Always a tragedy.”

Now that was funny. However, I realized, listening to Clark speak, I didn’t know exactly what my father did. From what I remembered, our family had been entrenched in the community. In what way, I didn’t actually know.

I decided that Clark might be the perfect person to ask.

“So, what exactly did my father do for a living?”

For the first time since meeting me, Clark went silent.

“What do you mean?”

“Aside from the obvious,” I said, chuckling. “I hadn’t seen him in a while and wanted to know how he spent his last days.”

“Oh,” Clark said, seemingly appeased. “Well, your father was taken care of by the community, rest assured. By our Lord as well. He kept up.”

Realizing something, Clark quickly fished around under the counter and fetched a small wooden object.

“Could I give this to you now?” he said, handing me the carving.

Looking it over in my hand, it was another bird. It had been whittled out of wood, stained dark with something that flaked off in brown pieces. Long stringy hair, I hoped from an animal, had been attached to the head.

“Save me the trouble of going to yours,” Clark said.

I looked him in the eyes. It didn’t seem I had a choice.

“Thanks, and don’t worry about paying. On the house.”

Halfway down the road, I opened the car window and threw it. Whatever my father had been up to, I wasn’t participating.

I reached the front steps of the house, birdsong filling my ears and the smell of burning filling my nose. I would be searching the house top to bottom and intended on figuring out what was going on, but my foot was blocked.

*That’s where the candles went*, I thought. Small crafts were littered in front of my door, all like the ones Clark and Linda had given me. Dozens of bundles of sticks, vines, hair, and feathers were spread. Some were hanging from the porch roof; most were arranged in circles. Wax candles were melting onto the wood, and bowls of dried bread covered the porch.

“Fuck,” I muttered, brushing past it to the kitchen to fetch a garbage bag. As I entered, I saw something even more concerning. The patch of dirt at the far end of the yard was no longer a patch. It was a hole. A deep, open grave.

Someone had dug him up.

Fuck.

\*\*\*

Three months before my father kicked us out of the house, I remembered when we had moved in, and I first saw the house. I remembered seeing the study and how I called it a tower.

“It’s called a turret. If it’s in a house, it’s a turret,” my father said.

“Like a gun?”

“It’s a homonym,” he said, eyes unwavering from the road ahead.

I didn’t really get it, but decided he was probably right.

“I like it,” I said. “Can you put my bed up there?” Emma whined from the back seat. “It’s a princess tower! It should be mine!”

“It’s actually a homonym,” I said, looking toward my father.

“It was your grandfather’s office, and I’m planning on continuing that,” he said, eyes still focused ahead.

And for most of my time in the house, that was the most I ever knew about my father’s office at the top of the turret. He worked at the top of the spiralling staircase every day. Forbidding us from ever going up there, even in an emergency. At seven years old, I did not have the words or knowledge to call it neglect, so I called it working.

Over the next three months, he spent most of his time up there working. The scarce times he came out, were mostly for the basics. Feeding us, telling us if we were being too loud, etc. The exception was once a month when he would leave in the morning to head into town. 

On these days, he would be gone for the entire day, and my siblings and I would take advantage of this fact. Playing games outside our rooms or playing hide and seek across the entire house.

I had only dared wait to see my father return a couple of times, staying up far past my bedtime. On those rare occasions, I would hear him drag all the boxes and garbage bags past my room, up the stairs, and into his office. Even rarer, I only ever waited at the bottom of my bedroom door once, peeking through the small crack to catch a glimpse of what he was doing. Three months after we had first moved in. My last day in the house.

It was hot. The whippoorwills and woodcocks called, through the humid summer heat, making me feel as if I was suffocating. Birdsong filled my ears, while the hot air choked my lungs. 

The day had been unremarkable otherwise, with none of my siblings having any motivation to play in the heat. So, I was bored. And with that boredom, I decided that I was going to figure out what my father went into town to get once a week, even if it was just a peek.

So, I waited, fighting against everything to stay awake. After what seemed like hours, my effort finally paid off, and my father returned. I watched him slowly drive down the long gravel driveway and roll to a stop at the front of the house.

He hefted the garbage bag from the bed of the truck with what looked like considerable effort and quickly maneuvered to the front door. Once he was inside, I silently crept to the bottom of my door. It was only a couple of seconds before I heard him again. He had given up on carrying the bag, now dragging it behind him down the hall.

It felt like forever. Crouched on the hard wooden floorboards with my face pressed painfully against the edge of the door, it couldn’t have been more than a few seconds. And as I saw my father shuffle into my view, dragging the black garbage bag behind him, that long awful moment stretched even longer.

My father passed by my view, his leather shoes wet and slick. Then came the garbage bag, black and taunt. Its contents bulged out from inside it, begging the plastic to tear and release it from my father. As time seemed to slow, the bag stared back at me. Or whatever was in the bag did.

My father was not alone, though.  After his leather shoes and the bag, next came his guest. Bare feet, wrinkled and muddy, walked calmly after him. Each toenail lay atop a layer of dirt and fungus, following my father without regard for what I had seen.

Then, as that eternity ended and the nightmare squelched out of my view, I noticed what my father and his guest had left behind. Blood. A long smear followed him up the turret and into his study. 

I never went to bed after that, and before I could run away or tell the police that my dad was a murderer, I was kicked out at only seven years old. Sent to live with a far-off aunt. Only reconnecting with my siblings years later and learning they had similar fates. Each of them sent away to different branches of the family tree. 

Now, staring out the window, seeing his grave excavated, I had confirmation that what I saw was real. That something about the house — my father — was wrong.

I knew what I had to do. Grabbing the garbage bags from the kitchen, I went back to the porch, propped open the door, and started roughly sweeping and spilling all the “gifts” I had received from my neighbours into them.  In my seventeen years away from home, I’d never been one for religion, but I respected it. However, this was different. Whatever cult my father had been a part of, and had now dragged me into, I was not going to be a part of it.

Spilling the bag’s contents into the fireplace, I knew I wouldn’t need to search for where my father had stored the kindling. Instantly, and almost eagerly, the fire engulfed the various dreamcatchers, idols, and effigies. 

That was the first problem addressed and if any neighbours keen to espouse their faith came along when I was at home, that problem would be addressed too. Violently if required. The problem of my father miraculously deciding to come back from hell and make my life worse was another. I walked to the end of the property where the grave now sat empty and waiting, the woods that surrounded the edges full of loud birdsong and calls.

Where I had first expected shovels, boot prints, and a clean excavation, what now sat in front of me was far more worrying.

It wasn’t clean. Nothing about it was clean. Not unlike the front porch, the grave was cluttered. Feathers and splintered wood surrounded it on all sides. The hole was equally weird. It was open sure but unlike a grave you’d find in a cemetery. It wasn’t neat or orderly, but rough and jagged. Instead of the dirt being piled next to the hole, the walls drifted in.

As if it wasn’t someone digging down to reach my father, but my father digging up to escape the earth. The last thing that caught my eye pushed me over the edge.

Ashen footprints, burned into the grass crawled out from the hole. Walking towards the woods.

*Nope.*

I only saw two options. One: Linda, Paul, Clark, and probably the rest of the town were insane. Or two: my father had decided to make a posthumous appearance at the family reunion in all his burnt awfulness. Not that those two were mutually exclusive. I was pretty sure that Linda would make me into a pot pie for the next of my siblings to inherit the house if given the opportunity.

Still, I didn’t exactly like either option. I wouldn’t be walking into any giant burning wooden statues or seeing my father again anytime soon if I had it my way.

The house was probably safe. And the study had answers. 

*I could leave now. Pack my stuff, rip out the driveway, and never come back.*

I went back inside and up the staircase.

*I have to see it.*

\*\*\*

There were no taxidermied heads on the shelves. No obvious bloody pentagrams on the floor. All things considered, I might have almost felt disappointed. Seventeen years of expectations and it looked like a normal study.

Like the rest of the house, every wall of the circular room was lined with bookshelves. There were a few end tables with lamps and knick-knacks on them, and a couch, but in the middle of the room was a large wooden desk.

Desk was the wrong word. It might’ve been one once, but it seemed to have been repurposed into something else. Cleared of everything to allow for space, old dark stains and deep gouges covered the surface. The red stains flowed from the table onto the floorboards, and I saw that the entire room was similarly marked. I then realized, it wasn’t just the floor and the desk. Every inch of wood was bloodstained, deepened to a dark brown with age. 

On the desk remained only one thing: a single sheet of paper. Written on it in heavy, dried ink were a few words. It wasn’t long, only a couple of sentences, but that didn’t mean each word didn’t stretch on.

*“Your great-great-great-grandfather fed it first. He found it in the woods, and it gave him miracles. So, it was only fair when he gave it himself and his family. That was the deal. We feed it; it feeds on us. Now it is your turn.*

*Starve it, Thomas. Let it starve. If not for me, for you. For your family who comes next. 17 years it has starved. I sent you away so it would. And now I bring you back so it will. I will let it starve in me and in you.”*

I didn’t touch the note. It would’ve felt wrong. Had he kicked us out to protect us? Was he just corrupted by whatever it was he was trying to feed?

A part of me wanted deep down to believe my father was a good man. To take this note and the cult as a sign he was manipulated. Or maybe he was just awful. Selfish enough to sacrifice his son to achieve his goal. Enough of a bastard to move us to a deathtrap cult.

Still, the blazing fireplace full of offerings and my dad's recent return to the land of the living were damning. I knew something strange was going on, and no matter my opinions of the man, he was warning me. 

As much as it pained me to agree with him, I would stay. If only for a small while.

\*\*\*

The garbage bag of meat, bread, and various crafts made from human detritus landed at the far end of the study. I bent over in the middle trying to catch my breath. If I had anything positive to look forward to, the developing six-pack from my daily workout of lugging the offerings up the tower was it. 

I looked across the room at my two weeks of work. The pile had easily grown as tall as me. Every day, multiple times a day, my neighbours would make their deliveries. At first, it was much of the same: home-cooked meals, rotting meat, and handcrafted idols.

The longer my charade continued, however, the more things escalated. From what I had heard in our brief interactions, small unfortunes were happening around town. Power outages, crop failures, personal injuries, and even deaths in the family. All were placed upon me. And with that, more serious offerings. Freshly butchered livestock, home-cooked casserole, and family heirlooms. Someone had even brought their three-year-old son. I was able to convince them to change their mind on that one. Barely.

I looked again at the blasphemous pile. I would have to figure out some other place to store the junk they kept giving me. The basement would work, but the smell hadn’t departed yet. Eerily, that wasn’t the only place I’d smelled it. On the few days, I’d left the house or opened a window, I could catch it on the wind. I’d stopped opening and started locking the windows after that.

As I descended the turret, I looked out the windows absentmindedly and my heart dropped. Paying attention, I could hear the birdsong from my childhood again. Now though, I knew its source.

Chances were, Linda and Paul were outside. I thought I could see Clark. I couldn’t see all of him, but someone who looked his size was kneeling in the long grass surrounding the manor. Even if it wasn’t him, dozens of others were arranged similarly around the house.

Every window I passed going down the turret, quickened my descent. I could see someone outside each one. Some had their hands stretched into the sky, others bowed low to the ground. It had to be the entire town. They had made a circle. A wall around the house. They were all singing in birdsong.

I sprinted down the stairs. If they got in, I had no idea what they’d do to me. All I knew was that they were crazy enough for me to be worried. 

The back door was locked, I remember that, same with the windows. The front door though, I couldn’t remember. As I exited the turret and bolted down the hall, I prayed with everything I had that I locked it.

Turning the corner and placing my hand on the brass door handle, for a single second I was filled with relief. It was locked.

Knock Knock.

The door handle slowly turned in my hand. It was imperceptible, so slow that to tell someone was trying to get it, you would have to feel it twisting dreadfully in your hand. And I did. Whoever was turning the handle had the strength of the world, a force of nature

Again, it came. Knock knock knock.

The scent of the basement seeped from beneath the door. Fresh now, the sickly-sweet odour hurt my nose. It's noxious, rancid smoke bringing tears to my eyes with its foulness. I panicked for a second trying to find the peephole to see the other side and remembered it didn’t exist. I was blind to whatever was behind the door.

Knock knock.

I had to get out of here. That was a long shot, though, even with a plan. Lucky for me, I could feel one forming. I prepared myself.

It was twilight when I was ready. The boarded windows, not even allowing moonlight inside. I unlocked the front door and bolted. Running back across the now-dark house.

My childhood bedroom door was already open; I couldn’t waste any time. Closing it behind me, I squatted to the floor. The summer heat hotter than any night in my childhood. The birdsong so much louder now than any time before. I waited for my guest.

The door opened. I could hear the footsteps slowly shuffling down the hallway. Passing the door in a few seconds, I only caught a glimpse of the feet. Burnt and charred, leaving blackened prints. Then they were gone, right up the stairs. He knew the way.

As soon as they were up the turret, I bolted out of my room, locking the front door. I placed my steps carefully in the few bare spots of the floor, not littered with books. If I went any faster, I’d slip on the gasoline.

I lit the fireplace.

The living room went up in flames immediately. The explosion of heat sent me flying across the room, hitting my head on the far wall.

Stars filled my view. Every inch of the old house was ablaze. Embers drifted onto me, burning my skin and threatening to ignite my clothes. It was hard to hear over the roar of the fire, but the birdsong had stopped, now replaced by furious knocks from every wall of the house.

The windows shattered, whether from the heat inside or my neighbours outside.  The boards held though, and any attempts at breaking through were stopped with the lick of flames. He wasn’t leaving the house. He was going to burn. I’d finish my father’s work.

Smoke burned my lungs. The room was filling with nowhere for it to go. I choked on the heat, coughing as I blindly stumbled through the house towards my escape route. I hoped with the frenzy of fire, I would be able to slip out unnoticed. If not, I’d fight my way through. Then, I heard it. Through the roar of flame and collapsing of home, it was deafening in comparison.

His footsteps echoed down the stairs. I stabilized myself and waited as he descended.

Seventeen years ago, when he had kicked me out, he had never said anything to me. He had never said goodbye. I hadn’t either.

I didn’t even remember what the last words I had said to him were.

Silhouette vague from the inferno around him, I took his form in. The fire and smoke didn’t allow for much visibility, but I could see parts of him. He was burnt. Some of that from when he was alive, some from whatever he was now. One of his arms had fallen off, the waxy fat dripping to the floor in clumps. An alien limb had grown in its place. A small skinny thing with hardened skin ending in four digits, each pointed with a talon. Small needles of burnt away feathers grew out of his flesh. 

I couldn’t see my father’s face. The smoke and heat obscured it. I could tell it was changed. No longer human, but still unrecognizably my father.

I smiled. Not for him. Not really.

I said nothing.

Best to not have any last words at all.

I’ve tried Hoffman, Tetsu, and a few other recipes in my V60–recipes that all have yielded consistently 7.5+/10 cups with a bunch of other beans (washed, natural, South American, African, etc.)—and still I can barely get anything more than a 4/10 cup.

Barely enjoyable though at least drinkable.

Suggestions more than welcome; feel like I’m losing my marbles.

- Hario tabbed japanese 02 filters

- Grind: 50 clicks from zero (supposedly 1200 microns but we all know that’s just burr displacement and not actual grind size—the resulting grind is a medium-fine, leaning fine.)

Just ordered another bag of Ethiopian from PERC last night (the Wush Wush beans) so I’m hoping to give their Ethiopian selection one more chance but I’m worried it’s going to be wasted money 🤦‍♂️

by Crathek of the Zarn Collective

They assigned me a human.

At first, I thought it was a joke—some kind of initiation prank. I even scanned the contract for irregularities, legal traps, or subroutines hidden in the fine print. But it was genuine. The flagship Vanguard of Ashes was to be helmed by Captain Mark Reynard, Terran, and I was to be his tactical advisor and second-in-command.

I reviewed his dossier. Combat veteran. Strategic honors. Sixteen confirmed evasive survival scenarios—nine of which were technically impossible. It read less like a career and more like the after-action report of a glitching simulation.

When I first met him, I saw nothing extraordinary. He was of average build for his species. Slightly underfed. Carried himself like someone who’d grown tired of explaining things to people who wouldn’t understand anyway. And yet, there was a confidence to his silence. A rhythm. As if he moved to a song I couldn’t hear.

I dismissed it. Humans were peculiar. Eccentric. Fragile.

They also refused to die.

⸻

Our first anomaly was a gravi-rift collapse near the Drastan Ridge. Sensor ghosts, variable time fields, and collapsing event horizons. Any sane captain would retreat. Mark simply stared at the main display.

Stared.

His hands worked the controls, entering complex navigational changes, without glancing at the datafeeds. But his eyes—they weren’t looking at anything. Not really. Just that unfocused Terran stare, as though something behind his skull had claimed his attention.

The crew fell silent. I opened my mandibles to speak—

“Don’t,” murmured the comms officer, a human named Yara. “Just wait.”

So I did. For three minutes, Mark guided the Vanguard through folding space like a phantom. Then he blinked, adjusted his seat, and began issuing orders as though nothing had happened.

We escaped unscathed.

⸻

It happened again during the Vor’skar particle field. And again when we encountered a drifting colony ship infected by psychotropic AI. And again in the void storm of Sector 8-Rho, where even time was screaming.

Each time, he would fall into that unseeing gaze. Each time, he moved like one possessed. Then he would return to himself, deliver instructions, and save us all.

I began logging the occurrences. Time duration. Pupil dilation. Limb tension. I cross-referenced them with neural lag markers from our medical AI, trying to determine if he was entering a combat trance, or perhaps some pre-programmed cognitive flow state.

Nothing consistent. Nothing logical.

Finally, I asked.

Yara looked at me like I’d asked if humans required air to breathe.

“He’s just daydreaming,” she said with a shrug.

I processed the word. Then again. Ran a linguistic check.

Daydreaming: a state of consciousness in which one’s thoughts drift away from immediate surroundings, often involving imaginative scenarios or reflections.

I stared at her. “You are telling me… our captain is imagining fictional scenarios in the middle of life-threatening crises?”

“Yeah,” she said, sipping rehydrated coffee. “Kinda his thing.”

⸻

I began watching more closely. Not just Mark’s eyes, but the tension in his frame, the way his fingers twitched or held the controls with absent-minded ease. I began to suspect that Mark didn’t calculate outcomes.

He felt them.

He once explained Terran jazz music to me—something about improvisation and “just knowing where the notes want to go.”

Was that how he piloted us through anomalies that devoured entire fleets?
Was he listening to the universe the way one listens to music?

The thought disturbed me more than the anomalies.

⸻

The final straw came on Galdrin’s Pass.

A rogue moon had collided with a synthetic Dyson array, creating a collapsing singularity field. Time loops, quantum splinters, and inverted reality bubbles. No ship had passed through. No one even attempted it anymore.

Mark charted a course.

He stared.

Longer than ever.

The crew waited. Not in fear—but in reverence.

I was sweating. Which was medically improbable for my species.

Then he whispered, “It’s just like threading a needle… in a dream.”

And we moved.

I saw stars bend and break around us. I saw alternate versions of the ship—of me—fracture and fade. I saw my own death and survival overlay like quantum echoes.

We emerged intact.

Not a scratch.

⸻

Later, in the quiet of the mess hall, I confronted him.

“Captain. Your… daydreaming. It’s a defect. It must be.”

He looked at me, those odd Terran eyes twinkling. “Maybe. Or maybe it’s how I hear things you can’t. Maybe I survive because I forget to be afraid.”

“That is not… comforting.”

He smiled. “Wasn’t trying to comfort you, Crathek.”

⸻

In the cycles since, I’ve stopped trying to explain him.

I’ve served under warlords with triple-brain clusters. Pilots with built-in precognition. A machine once that could calculate all probabilities before its next breath.

None of them ever survived half of what Mark has.

So I no longer call him defective.

I call him terrifying.
And I follow him into the dark—
because he always brings us back.",1,1752527710.0,TerranStories,0,1.0,False

This dwarf prefers the chilly peaks and valleys of Dun Morogh (DM for short) outside of Ironforge.

One time, this fella from the city—Stormwind, maybe—sees me sweating buckets. Absolutely drenched. And he has the fireballs to say:

“Hey buddy, dwarf, my guy! Just drink somethin’ hot! Like tea or coffee!”

I was baffled. Bewildered. Deeply offended.

But before I knew it, my stubby legs were clacking through Ironforge, past the Deeprun Tram, and straight into Deep Brew Den ’n Donuts. I ordered a large hot extra-extra... on the rocks.

And you know what?

That Stormwind trash was right.

I know new Stanley products went through a recent boon with coffee shops, social media, and schools so some info in case people are interested:

\- Label is Aladdin Stanley, removed from the one on the show. Aladdin Industries owned Stanley from 1965 to 2002.  
  
\- The entire model designation is A-944DH Quart  
  
\- Bottle is a vacuum type, perfect for keeping Kramer's coffee scalding hot.  
  
\- The collapsing handle is a No. RH94. Like Kramer, I find it uncomfortable to use for carry and pouring unless it's hung down low like a lunch box.  
  
\- Not pictured on either my bottle (though, I do have mine) or Kramer's is the No. 100 Cup which screws into the stainless threads up top for transport. I imagine Kramer has to use the plastic cup because his good cup was taken by a homeless man.

\- The green stopper is a No. 13B and doesn't just keep fluid in with a gasket seal, but can be unscrewed only partially to expose some feeding holes, allowing one to pour from the concave top at a controlled rate with a no-spill pattern; pretty nifty for the time and perfect for Kramer to take to an outdoor event.

1lzyplo,https://www.reddit.com/r/summerprogramresults/comments/1lzyplo/an_indepth_review_of_leadership_initiatives/,An In-Depth Review of Leadership Initiatives’ Advanced Medical and Public Health Internship,"**Disclaimer:** I wrote this post because when I was first looking into this program, there was so little information about it posted by sources other than Leadership Initiatives (LI) itself. Outside of this program, I have never been associated with LI. I am not being paid to do this. I am telling my honest thoughts and opinions.  

**First Impression:** I first heard about LI through HOSA. Mr. Marshall Bailly came to our state conference and hosted a seminar about it. He highlighted all the benefits (ex. free ACT/SAT prep, college essay help, exclusive webinars, etc.) and learning experiences one can gain from the internship. He gave us an online form and said the first few responses will gain automatic admission to any LI Internship. He failed to mention the form will require a \~$100 deposit and that the actual cost of the internship is \~$2000 + your transportation. The cost was actually supposed to be \~$3000 but HOSA admittees got a discount. 

Regarding whether it’s worth it, LI is what you make it. The week-long summer program is very much pay-to-play. If you finish the internship and choose to do nothing else with LI whatsoever, then LI will just be another addition to your college apps. If you choose to do the year-long, online International Internship Program (IIP) or enroll in another LI program, then great! You’ll get to connect more with the doctors and lecturers and access various other resources. 

That said, this program was a life-changing experience for me and I’m glad that I did it. My full review is down below and separated into the following sections: Lectures & Workshops, Food, Student Facilities, Benefits, Final Thoughts. 

**My Schedule:**

First off, before the program, you get access to a NEO Learning account. You’ll get 2 modules, one of which is a presentation practice assignment. Don’t bother doing it. You don’t really need NEO until after the program starts. Even then, the only thing you should look at on there is the workshop guide they provide you for your project. Second off, keep in mind my schedule and yours likely won’t be the same. Finally, here’s my day-by-day experience.

Sunday was a calm day. The check-in takes so long. You have to line up to get your ID and LI bag (which only has a notebook and shirt). You then have to line up at another line to make sure you have your digital key (to access elevators and your dorm building). You then head to the dorms to drop off your luggage outside your room. You can’t access it until you get your key, which you also had to line up for. This whole process was so inefficient and annoying. 

We were told to wear our internship shirts, IDs, and to head to an auditorium. Mr. Bailly made a whole speech about the internship not being a pay-to-play program (it is) and how transformative this internship would be. He also emphasized how prestigious it is for college admissions. He emphasized past students got into schools like Harvard, Yale, etc. I don't doubt it, but I doubt those students got in solely because of LI. Next, he introduced us to the LI team, which includes doctors, program leads, and other staff members (most of whom are program alumni who are current high schoolers and college students).

We were then introduced to our week project. Everyone was grouped into teams of 7 people and assigned to a disease (typhoid fever, malaria, anemia, and acute respiratory infections) and one day of a 3-day workshop (understanding, prevention, taking action). Your team has Thursday to create a workshop dedicated to your disease and task area. You will be guided by a team leader.

We had a pizza dinner and got to know our teammates. Afterward, we took a bus to and then toured the Lincoln Memorial, the National Mall, and the MLK Jr. Memorial. We went back to our dorms and had a bed check at 10:30 PM. That’s day one done. 

Monday was insanely busy. They weren’t kidding when they said we’d be working 14 hour days. You’ll be getting 45-minute overviews of typhoid fever, malaria, acute respiratory infections, and anemia. The speakers were doctors who actually flew out from Nigeria just to speak to the students. The actual presentation for each is probably like 20 minutes. Most of the time is taken up by students’ questions. A program staffer spoke to us about public health in the world versus in Nigeria. We also had a guest speaker (a pediatric urologist) and answered all of our questions well. We also had a plaster casting workshop, which was super fun. You then get work time with your team for your project. You can choose to explore the Georgetown neighborhood (in supervised groups) after or go straight to bed.

Tuesday was exciting. We were woken up at 7 AM (if you’re a fellow alumni reading this… then you know how). It was a skills day and we got to practice CPR, dissection, diagnosis, suturing, intubation, laparoscopy, ultrasound, taking vital signs, venipuncture, etc. with minimal breaks in between. The people heading the workshops were either the doctors or staff members. They all did great and answered questions well. I especially enjoyed intubation, since the instructor was incredibly cool. I also liked ultrasound, since you actually get to practice on a real person. The only critique I have is that during suturing, we just got handed a kit and told to watch a Youtube video. Not exactly something I’d expect from a \~$2500 dollar program. 

Wednesday was okay. We attended a presentation on leadership in healthcare by a doctor, social determinants of health by another doctor, and public health in the real world by a retired Georgetown professor. We got to practice suturing even more, conducted roleplay patient interviews with fellow interns, and had work time on our workshop. We had Georgetown exploration afterward too.

On Thursday, we had speakers about neuroscience, emergency medicine, and public speaking. The neuroscience doctor was especially interesting. He was extremely eloquent and raised a lot of issues with brain chips and AI. The emergency medicine speaker was a paramedic and was really funny. The public speaking expert was so nice and so kind. We then had a presentation about IIP, which is free and year-long. IIP is like the summer program, but longer and more-in depth. It's free and completely online. Mr. Bailly emphasized so much how it would be good for college apps, and that we should all apply by tomorrow because he'd be going on a call with Microsoft, Starbucks, and Amazon to request the budget for next year and needed an exact number of people who applied. No hate to the man, but he really needs to tone down the ""LI is great and prestigious and colleges will love it"" talk.

On Friday, we had presentations and our diagnoses. 

The presentations weren’t bad. You’re in a small classroom with four people (the doctors and a program head) and the two other groups assigned to your disease. You’re going to be recorded while presenting. At the end, the judges do give feedback, but there isn’t gonna be like an oral defense. It honestly feels like you’re presenting in school. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I’ll let you decide. 

When we were studying for our diagnosis later in the afternoon, Mr. Bailly came in the room and announced there was a study recently published which showed the VR headsets were not effective in enhancing patient experience or whatever he said. We would not be using the VR goggles, as advertised. We did our diagnoses with Zoom on a desktop set-up. I was in a private room and asked to wear a lab coat. 

I was extremely nervous, but it really was not that bad. My diagnosis took 5-7 minutes. Not going into the specifics cause of, well, HIPAA. One thing that felt off, however, is that the doctor didn’t let my patient talk. At all. This is despite the camera facing the patient and the doctor being in the background. I didn’t even see the doctor’s face. And yet, the doctor was the one answering my questions and the only direct interaction I had with my patient was them waving their hand goodbye at me. I understand why, since the patient likely didn’t speak English at all. Still, I was hoping the doctor would serve as more of a translator between me and my patient, than the conversation just happening between the two of us. I got my diagnosis right, but don’t worry if you get it wrong. Your patient is already being treated. You’re not sentencing someone to death if you forget a disease. 

The party after the presentations and diagnoses sucked, in my opinion. But I’m not a big party person anyway. Give the party a chance when you get there. You can leave early if you want. 

Saturday was just everyone packing up and leaving. The program itself is really only 5 days.

**Food:** You will get fed. Don’t worry about that.  There are plenty of snacks outside the lounge. You’ll get 3 meals a day. There are coolers with water and canned drinks. The coolers even get ice sometimes.  No, I'm not kidding. I'm serious. There’s no ice machine, so you’re kind of on your own. There is, however, a (super full) fridge in the lounge. Bring a marker so you can write your name down your drinks and put them in the fridge or freezer overnight. Alternatively, I put my water bottles on top of the air conditioning unit overnight. It worked pretty well. 

Regarding the meal form, pick wisely. Don’t pick salads just because you want to be healthy. You’re gonna be learning and moving all day so get something that will fill you up. Speaking from experience here. Also, I’d advise against ordering from the 90 Second Pizza restaurant. I have no doubt the pizza would be good fresh out of the oven, but by the time they get to the pick up tables they will be cold and soggy. The same applies to all of the other options too, but the pizza especially. 

Breakfast for all the days is the same. It'll be on the lounge in your dorm floor. You can get bagels, waffles, white bread, cereal, coffee, and juice.

**Student Facilities:** The dorms aren’t… bad, but they could definitely be better. 

Most likely, you will be sharing a room with another person. You will get 1 bed, 1 desk, 1 closet, 4 small shelves, 3 drawers, and 1 small cabinet. You’re in charge of making your own bed when you get there. They provide the sheets and one pillow.

The bed frame is annoyingly tall. I’m 5 feet and the bed reaches up to my waist. The space under is good for putting your luggage in, but I’m not sure that’s worth it considering I had to perform gymnastics just to get in the bed. The bed itself is decent. You’re gonna be run ragged, so you should really be able to sleep anywhere.

Bathrooms and showers are ok. There are multiple on each floor. You might have to wait a few minutes if you’re going after 9 PM since that’s when most activities will be over. So just wake up early to save yourself the trouble. You’re allowed to go shower starting from 5:45 AM. You’re not allowed to shower after 10:30 PM, since that’s after bed check. Staff will be walking around. 

You get physical keys to your dorm room, despite them telling us that we would be getting digital ones and making us download an app. The app is just for scanning doors and elevators. Also, don’t lose that key or it’s a $150 charge. 

If you’re going to the gym, you’re gonna have to either wake up and get downstairs by 5:45 AM or go there during exploration time. You have to be with staff members at all times, so you cannot go out of the dorms without them. 

I didn’t use Door Dash but if you’re planning to get anything do it really early because you can’t pick it up yourself. You need to get staff to do it for you, because we were told delivery drivers find it hard to navigate the campus.

Also, make sure to follow the packing list. Bring hangers, cause you won’t get any in your closet. Bring a caddy. You can, if you want, check out an umbrella (and other stuff like a hair dryer) at the office downstairs, so don’t buy stuff you don’t need to.  Make your life easy. 

**Benefits:** The benefits are legit, if a bit overexaggerated. 

The free ACT and SAT prep helped me immensely, but the programs don’t come with personal help. I was using Testive but then they changed to Prep Scholar. Both programs only had me do practice questions and tests. They provided the answer keys with short explanations but if you want one-on-one meetings to clear up confusion, you have to pay more.

I was able to meet with a College Advisor for 25 minutes, but only once. I got my questions answered, though, so I did find that helpful. 

I got my community service hours verified, so that was great too. 

I can’t say anything about the other benefits, since I haven’t used them yet. 

**Final Thoughts:** I chose not to pursue IIP. Mostly because it’ll be my senior year soon and I didn’t want any more commitments. I loved the summer internship program, though. I met so many wonderful people I never would’ve otherwise. I loved the challenges and experiences it provided. If money isn’t an issue, and you have the time, do the program. It was a life-changing program for me, and I will never forget it.

Because I'm genuinely confused,"What exactly was the plan putting Yates and Campenaerts in the breakaway and then letting the gap go to 6 minutes?

**My theory:** If the peloton stays closer (2-3 min), they launch Vingegaard to bridge across. Ideal scenario = Tadej isn't there or gets isolated, and suddenly you've got a 3-man death squad up front pulling each other to victory.

**What actually happened:** They let that gap stretch until it became physically impossible for anyone not named Pantani to close it down.

# The tactical breakdown (as I see it):

* ✅ Get two solid guys in the break
* ✅ Have your GC weapon ready to deploy
* ❌ Actually control the gap to make the plan work
* ❌ Put bodies on the front to keep it manageable

Like, they should have had a couple guys tempo-ing on the front of the peloton to keep everyone honest. 6 minutes isn't a gap, it's a different time zone.

# Am I missing something here?

Was this some 4D chess move that went over my head? Did they just get caught out by how strong the break was? Or did someone in the team car take an ill-timed coffee break?

Because from my couch, this looked like having a loaded gun but forgetting to bring bullets.

**EDIT:** For context, this felt like they had all the pieces for a perfect tactical play but just... didn't execute the most crucial part (gap management).

**EDIT 2:** Yes, I know hindsight is 20/20, but 6 minutes is 6 minutes. That's not getting closed in modern racing unless something catastrophic happens to the break.

Let's face it: you're building a business, juggling a million things, and somehow expected to be a marketing guru, too. Creating compelling content that attracts customers and builds your brand can feel overwhelming, especially when you're watching every penny. But fear not! This guide unveils a treasure trove of *free* and low-cost tools that'll have you crafting killer content without breaking the bank.

**The Challenge:** Getting Your Message Seen (and Heard!)

Many small business owners struggle to create professional-looking marketing materials. Maybe you're stuck using outdated software, or you simply lack the budget to hire a designer and copywriter. The result? Generic content that gets lost in the noise. Without engaging visuals and persuasive writing, your brilliant business ideas might never reach their target audience. It’s a tough cycle: you need to market to grow, but marketing feels expensive.

**Unleash Your Inner Creative: The DIY Content Creation Playbook**

Creating engaging content doesn't require a fortune; it just takes the right tools and a little know-how. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you craft compelling content on a shoestring budget:

*   **Step 1: Define Your Brand Voice.** Before you start designing or writing, understand your brand’s personality. Are you playful and quirky, or serious and professional? Knowing this will ensure consistency across all your content.

    *   *Example:* A local bakery might adopt a warm, friendly tone, while a financial advisor might opt for a more trustworthy and authoritative voice.

    *   *Pro-Tip:* Create a brand style guide – even a simple one – outlining your font choices, color palette, and tone of voice. This will save you time and ensure consistency.

*   **Step 2: Design Stunning Visuals (for Free!).** Visual content is king! Thankfully, you don't need Photoshop expertise to create eye-catching graphics.

    *   Use Canva's free plan to design social media posts, presentations, logos, and more. Their drag-and-drop interface is incredibly intuitive.
    *   Unsplash and Pexels offer a vast library of high-quality, royalty-free images. No more cheesy stock photos!
    *   Infographics are a great way to present data and information in an engaging way. Canva has templates for that too!

    *   *Example:* If you're launching a new product, create an eye-catching graphic for Instagram highlighting its key features and benefits.

    *   *Common Pitfall:* Don't overcrowd your designs. Less is often more. Focus on clear messaging and a visually appealing layout.

*   **Step 3: Write Compelling Copy That Converts.** Words matter! Your copy needs to grab attention, build trust, and persuade your audience to take action.

    *   Use Grammarly's free version to catch typos and grammatical errors. Polished writing builds credibility.
    *   Headline Analyzer tools (like those from CoSchedule) help you craft attention-grabbing headlines that drive clicks.
    *   Tell a story! People connect with stories. Share your brand's origin, customer success stories, or even a behind-the-scenes glimpse of your business.

    *   *Example:* Instead of saying ""We offer the best coffee,"" try ""Experience the rich, aromatic blend that's become a local favorite.""

    *   *Pro-Tip:* Read your copy aloud. Does it sound natural and engaging? If not, revise it.

*   **Step 4: Repurpose Your Content.** Don't let your hard work go to waste! Repurpose existing content to reach a wider audience.

    *   Turn a blog post into a series of social media updates.
    *   Create a short video summarizing a longer article.
    *   Compile several blog posts into an ebook or guide.

    *   *Example:* Transform a customer success story into a testimonial video for your website and social media channels.

*   **Canva:** Free graphic design platform with templates for social media, presentations, logos, and more. Perfect for creating visually appealing content without design experience.
*   **Unsplash & Pexels:** Libraries of high-quality, royalty-free images to enhance your content. No more paying for expensive stock photos!
*   **Grammarly:** Free grammar and spell checker that helps you polish your writing and build credibility.
*   **CoSchedule Headline Analyzer:** Analyze the effectiveness of your headlines and craft attention-grabbing titles that drive clicks.

I recently cold-approached a cute woman on the street and need some advice:

I kept it short and friendly and introduced myself, I said I found her cute. 

She told me her name, age, what she does, and when I asked if she was single, she said yes but mentioned she's busy at the moment, because she studies medicine.  
After asking for her number she gave me a pause (she even gave me that thoughtful ""checking me out"" look), she said:  
*""Okay, here’s my Instagram. I’ll for sure reply to you.""*

I messaged her a few hours later so the impression would still be fresh. She replied 6 hours later. Over the next few messages, I kept the conversation going by asking a few light questions, but her replies always came several hours later — sometimes 5 to 12 hours. After she said she studied medicine which is stressful I wanted to keep it simple and direct... I thought this few words text exchange is worthless.

Her answers also were getting shorter.

Eventually, I straight up asked **if she'd like to grab a coffee sometime and get to know each other.**  
Her reply: *“****Sure, but I have exams coming up, so I’ll be available in August****.”*  
I said: *“****Awesome, then message me in August. Good luck with your exams!****”*  
She responded: *“****I surely will do :)****”*

**Question: So now I’m wondering — should I have kept texting to build more connection, or was backing off and letting her focus on exams the better move?**

1lzyhp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lzyhp6/im_being_accused_of_stealing_they_want_to_take_my/,"I’m being accused of stealing, they want to take my keys and lock me inside the house","I don’t know where else to post this. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I’m scared, I can’t sleep properly, and I have no idea who to trust anymore.

I’m 19, living with my grandmother, who’s 67. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. I moved in with her after finishing school. Right now I’m studying at a driving school and dreaming of moving in with my boyfriend asap, because I honestly can’t take it anymore.

I’m being accused of stealing, constantly humiliated, and now they even want to take away my keys, change the lock, and literally lock me in the apartment so I “wait” for the supposed thief.

 How it all started
I was raised in a very religious family that basically made me terrified of doing anything “bad.” I’ve been agnostic for a while now, but one thing stayed with me — I hate the very idea of stealing or betraying anyone. But my family seems to have forgotten everything they ever taught me. They’ve accused me multiple times of things that are completely insane.

 First incident
Three years ago, I was living with my grandmother while studying. One day she barges into my room yelling for me to get out of the house. Why? She thought I had lit a candle on the kitchen table and brought friends over for “occult rituals.”
The candle wasn't even mine. She has lots of candles, and I honestly think she just forgot she bought two of the same kind. One was at my brother's place.
I respected her and always followed her rules, especially the one about not bringing friends over. But she didn’t believe me and kicked me out. So I packed my things and moved to my dad’s place in the countryside.
That turned out to be even worse. He started drinking again and yelling at me. I ended up moving in with a friend, worked part-time, and studied for 7 months. I only came back when grandma “calmed down.” But obviously, that didn’t last.

 Second incident
About a year ago, $4000 went missing (money sent to my grandma by my mom’s sister). I didn’t even know the money existed. But I got accused. My mom called me and said things I don’t even want to repeat. I told them I’ve never stolen anything and never will. The only response I got was something like, “Well, maybe it was someone else.” Really? I’m supposed to be grateful I’m not the only suspect now?!

 And today…
Grandma was supposed to spend the night at my brother's. I invited my boyfriend over. We were watching a cartoon, just chilling. Suddenly the doorbell rings. It’s grandma. She looked furious. I immediately told her my boyfriend was there, hoping maybe she’d hold back a little with him around. He left soon after and tried to calm me down because my hands were literally shaking from the anxiety.
As soon as he left, she started yelling at me again. Then she said two big boxes were missing — they had coffee, sugar, pasta, and a tea set, all sent by my mom’s brother. We searched the entire apartment. They're gone.
Now she says it was either me, my dad, or both of us “working together.”

Now I’m really starting to suspect my dad
When I lived with him, the keys to grandma’s apartment were often lying around in the hallway. He definitely could’ve seen or even copied them.
Now he claims he works in construction, but suddenly has money again. He even bought new car parts and gave me some cash for small things.
And I remember my mom once told me that back in the day, he used to pawn household stuff and didn’t admit it until he was caught.

Or is it my boyfriend?
This sounds awful. He’s really sweet. Almost too sweet. He’s slept over a couple of times and each time, he couldn’t sleep. He said he just stared at me all night. It’s kinda romantic and also terrifying. What if he waited for me to fall asleep and let someone in? Or took something himself?
He loves pasta and pasta was one of the things that disappeared. The box was sealed with tape. It’s not like you could just take a little and go unnoticed.
But I’ve slept at his place too, and he didn’t sleep well with me there either

Or maybe the neighbors?
I literally hear them like they’re in the same room as me. I can even hear them fart.
What if they can hear everything we say and somehow got in while we were out?
So from now on, I’ve decided to write important things to my grandma on paper, so not even the walls could “hear” us. I’m also going to start photographing my room and hers every time I leave the house just to see if anything moves or disappears.

If grandma is making this up, therapy is out of the question. She thinks it's nonsense. I’ll go myself when I can afford it. Right now, the only thing keeping me sane is support from my friends and boyfriend.

Grandma wants to take my keys, change the lock, and make me stay home to “wait for the thief.”
My brother will be the one changing the lock, and I’m already bracing myself for more verbal abuse from him.

I don’t know what’s happening to me. Maybe it is paranoia. Or maybe this is really a dangerous situation. I seriously don’t know anymore is this a breakdown or should I actually be afraid? What do I do?

I initially bought mine thinking it would be my dedicated smoothie maker, but I've discovered so many other uses that have completely changed my kitchen game.

First off, these powerful machines can handle tough ingredients like frozen fruits, ice, and nuts with ease. While they make incredible smoothies (seriously, the smoothest ones I've ever had), they're absolute workhorses for other tasks too.

I regularly use mine for:
- Making nut butters from scratch
- Blending hot soups
- Creating homemade salsa and dips
- Grinding coffee beans
- Preparing baby food
- Making flour from oats
- Crushing ice for cocktails
- Whipping up pancake batter

The key is in their powerful motor and blade design. Unlike basic blenders (https://athometouch.com/Smoothie-Makers), Ninja blenders come with different blade attachments that let you tackle various kitchen tasks. The stacked blade system is particularly impressive - it creates a vortex effect that pulls ingredients down for even blending.

One thing I've learned is that blade height matters. The tall blade assembly in Ninja blenders means you can process larger quantities of food compared to standard blenders. This has been super helpful when I'm meal prepping or hosting parties.

However, if you're primarily interested in making smoothies, you might want to check out dedicated smoothie makers (https://athometouch.com/Smoothie-Makers). They often come with specialized features for perfect smoothie consistency and convenient single-serve options.

Something worth mentioning is the cleaning process. Ninja blenders usually have dishwasher-safe parts, which is a huge plus. The blade assembly comes apart easily, letting you clean those hard-to-reach spots where food particles might hide.

I've found these blenders particularly useful for:
1. Food processing tasks (chopping vegetables, making breadcrumbs)
2. Creating smooth purees
3. Mixing dough for baked goods
4. Emulsifying sauces and dressings

The durability is impressive too. I've had mine for three years now, using it almost daily, and it still works like new. The motor hasn't lost any power, and the blades are just as sharp as day one.

Price-wise, they're a solid investment considering their versatility. Instead of buying separate appliances for different tasks, one Ninja blender can handle multiple kitchen duties effectively.

From my experience, these machines are excellent for anyone who enjoys cooking and wants to expand their culinary capabilities beyond just making smoothies. Whether you're a health enthusiast, home chef, or busy parent, a Ninja blender can significantly simplify your food prep routine.",1,1752526935.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

When caffeine wears off I get extra pissed off. Usually I get very angry with the way society functions and a lot of things, but when caffeine no longer affects my body I get enraged by very little.  
  
It might be better for me to reduce my caffeine intake. Maybe I should only have one cup of coffee a day. Also avoiding the internet should be something I do more. People tend to make me angry, but posts online highlight the absolute worst people, especially on Instagram.  
  
My anger does not need to go in vain. It is possible for me to use my anger for something productive. Working on my writing out of spite perhaps. In that case caffeine might benefit me more. I take caffeine because it makes me relaxed and focused. I also can get quite extroverted when on caffeine. There are certainly benefits, but the comedown is just plain awful.

Last week, my mom announced that she wants to give my partner and I an early wedding gift and upgrade our espresso machine from the humble little Breville Infuser we currently have. She and my Dad got my brother and his wife the Micra a year ago for their wedding, and she was thinking of the same one for us.

I’m a pretty big coffee geek and so I know that the Micra is one of the best of the best for home machines. I’m probably going to go with that, but of course I want to take the time to carefully consider all options for such a big purchase.

**I’d like to Hear reasons** ***not*** **to buy the Micra?** After reading up on it, I was surprised to learn that such a high end machine lacked what I’d have assumed would be standard features at that price point. For example, the inability to do pre-infusion unless it‘s plumbed in, limited only to “pre-brew”. We rent our home so plumbing in the machine is a non-starter, unfortunately.

**Will I be happy with “pre-brew” or will I wish I had a controllable pre-infusion?**

Another thing that shocked me to learn when I asked my brother what he didn’t like about his machine (he absolutely loves it overall) was that the hot water spout is unsuitable for americanos and that you have to heat water in a kettle. To have a $5.5k (CAD) machine not be able to make an americano seems… insane. Our most common espresso drink to make is a short americano / long black, with just 120ml of water or so. I also often like to make a *very* short “long black” and add maybe 40-50ml of water to a shot.

**Is there really no way to get hot water for a drink directly from the machine?**

**Are there any other drawbacks I should be taking into consideration?**

**I’d also love suggestions about what other machines I should be considering for the purchase.** In addition to simply wanting an excellent machine, we have space requirements due to a very tiny kitchen. **The Micra’s footprint is about as big as we can do without moving the grinder to another spot in the kitchen**, which is a pain for coffee prep but also means we sacrifice valuable counter space for cooking. **Another sticking point is that we really need a machine that has the steam wand on the right, as our machine will be in a corner with the wall on the left.** It seems like by far the majority of high end machines put the steam on the left.

1lzyeub,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1lzyeub/are_delonghi_espresso_machines_a_good_brand/,Are De'Longhi espresso machines a good brand?,"As someone who's been making espresso at home for years, I've tried a bunch of different machines. Recently, I've been using a De'Longhi espresso maker, and I've got to say, I'm pretty impressed.

De'Longhi is an Italian company that's been around since the 1950s. They're known for making all sorts of kitchen appliances, but their espresso machines are what really stand out to me. I've found that they strike a good balance between quality and affordability.

One thing I really like about De'Longhi machines is how easy they are to use. Even if you're new to making espresso, you can figure out how to use one of these pretty quickly. They've got clear instructions and simple controls. Plus, most of their models come with a built-in frother, which is great if you like lattes or cappuccinos.

Another plus is that De'Longhi machines are pretty durable. I've had mine for a couple of years now, and it's still going strong. They're made with good materials, and they seem to hold up well over time.

Of course, no brand is perfect. Some people say that De'Longhi machines aren't as high-end as some other brands. And that's fair - if you're looking for a super fancy, professional-grade machine, you might want to look elsewhere. But for most home users, I think De'Longhi offers more than enough quality.

If you're interested in checking out some De'Longhi espresso machines (or other brands), I've found a great place to start looking. This link: https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines has a good selection of espresso makers, including some De'Longhi models.

One thing to keep in mind is that there are different types of De'Longhi machines. They have manual ones, semi-automatic ones, and fully automatic ones. The manual ones are cheaper but require more work. The automatic ones are pricier but do most of the work for you. It really depends on how much control you want over the process and how much you're willing to spend.

I've also noticed that De'Longhi machines are pretty good at maintaining the right temperature for espresso. This is really important for getting a good shot. Some cheaper machines struggle with this, but De'Longhi seems to have it figured out.

Cleaning is another factor to consider. In my experience, De'Longhi machines are pretty easy to clean. Most parts can be removed and washed separately, which is handy.

Price-wise, De'Longhi offers a range of options. You can find basic models for under $100, while their high-end machines can cost several hundred dollars. I think their mid-range options offer the best value for most people.

If you're thinking about getting an espresso machine, whether it's a De'Longhi or another brand, I'd recommend checking out that link I mentioned earlier: https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They've got a good variety of machines at different price points.

Overall, I'd say De'Longhi is a solid brand for home espresso makers. They're reliable, user-friendly, and make good espresso. While they might not be the absolute top-of-the-line, they offer great value for most coffee lovers.

#CANDLE MAGICK

I wanted to focus on candle spells first, because I want to make sure that people understand that they are merely ONE OPTION for spellwork. 

We tend to see candle magick more than most other types, because candle spells are super aesthetically pleasing and look great on camera/social media. 

Because of this, a lot of newcomers to our subreddit feel like they *have* to use candles in their spellwork, and are concerned when faced with situations that don't allow for fire or smoke (such as apartment or dorm living).

The reality is, you can always combine candle magick with other types of spellwork, and many witches do, but you absolutely do not have to. Other types of spells are complete all on their own.

###To preface:

[A guide on Fire Safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/173rfxb/lets_talk_about_fire_safety/)

[A guide on dressing spell candles](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1g2dsfn/a_guide_to_dressing_spell_candles_while_keeping/).

Candles are an easy way to focus energy and intention, using the element of fire to release that energy into the universe. They are multi-purpose, and great for basically any magickal goal.

##YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES/TRADITION WILL DICTATE:

>The type of candle you will use (tapers, tea lights, birthday candles, chime candles, Hanukkah candles, pillars, figure shapes, jar candles, 7 day candles, etc).
>
>Whether you want to let a candle burn completely in one go.
>
>Whether you wish to let a candle spell burn for a set time before extinguishing.
>
>If you want to dress a larger candle for a purpose (i.e. protection), and re-use it for multiple related workings.
>
>If you want to energetically cleanse a used candle and use it for a different purpose later.
>
>If you want to carve your intentions for the spell into the candle itself.
>
>If you want to use coloured candles to incorporate colour correspondences in your spell, or simply use one type/colour of candle for all spells. 
>
>If you wish to engage in divination by reading the candle's flame or wax.
>
>How you will dispose of the candle spell remains (the trash, burying, disposing of in running water, leaving at a crossroads, keeping on the altar until results have shown, carrying with you in a sachet or similar, storing in your pillow case, melting down and creating new candles, etc. 
>Much will depend on your personal philosophies and ethics, as well as what symbolism makes sense in the context of your spell).

##NEVER LEAVE A BURNING CANDLE UNATTENDED!

As author Judika Illes puts it:

*”Never assume that because you’re engaged in magical or spiritual acts that common-sense fire safety does not also apply. Fire is never completely safe.”*

---


#CONTAINER SPELLS:

Container spells are a collection of magickal ingredients that correspond with the spell’s purpose or goal (herbs, crystals, petitions, oils, sigils, and other symbolic items), compiled together in an appropriate vessel. The container is then energetically charged to carry out its intended purpose.

The type of container used can be just as symbolically significant to the purpose of the spellwork as the ingredients inside. 

Some container spells are used for gathering and releasing a specific kind of energy, some for attracting certain things to us, and some for sealing and trapping energy inside.

Let's look at some popular variations of container spells and what their ideal uses might be:

---


##JARS/BOTTLES:

Sealed and usually meant to remain closed. 

Great for spells that seek to contain the target of the spell within the ingredients inside, and hold them there in that state. 

Great for spells that act as traps for negative energy or baneful spirits and magick, or for spells that need to be stored or hidden in some way. 

**SUGGESTED USES:** [sour jars](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/s/M3Ici1HPgs) or other hex jars, sweetening jars/honey jars, [witch bottles](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/s/lPB7RTmmW7), [freezer spells](https://www.luckymojo.com/freezer.html). 


###**Possible substitutions with similar symbolism:**

Containers that can be sealed:

•Ziploc baggies  
•Pill bottles  
•Empty film canisters  
•Food packages (spice jars, jam jars, chili oil jars, salsa jars, baby food jars)  
•Ointment or lip balm tins  
•Breathmint tins  
•Coffee tins  

---

##BOWLS:

Left open, to interact with your environment. 

Ideal for attracting specific energy, or allowing energy to radiate outward and circulate.  

Can be added to or fed over time to keep up energy flow.


**SUGGESTED USES:** offering bowls for deities or spirits, prosperity bowls, protection bowls, salt/cleansing bowls meant to absorb negativity from an area, firesafe bowls for ritually burning petitions or other things, spells to attract love, luck, success, or opportunity.


###**Possible substitutions with similar symbolism:**

Any open vessel:

•A candy dish  
•A tupperware  
•A cup or mug  
•Ramekins or little sauce dishes  
•Lids (jar lids, candle lids, etc)  
•A box without a lid 


---

##BOXES:

While some spell boxes are designed to be used for one singular purpose and then discarded, destroyed, or buried, some are made to be reused.

Usually kept in a singular location. Can remain shut, or can be tended to and refreshed when needed. 

Boxes can be a long-term storage of energy. They can be warded or bound from the outside to keep targets or energies confined within. 

Can be used as a tool that charges or cleanses other objects.

Can be used to keep things safe and secure, or keep them secret. 

**SUGGESTED USES:** [mirror boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/s/uwJmQcr0f7), binding spells, “wish boxes” or dream boxes, boxes for collecting affirmations, a protection box for storing poppets of yourself or loved ones and keeping them safe, a box that cleanses any items placed inside, a box for charging items, a box for enchanting items, a box of negative thoughts or energies that is buried to release them, enclosed altars, housing servitors, secret spells that are shut away when not actively working on them.


---

##SACHETS/BAGS:

Multiple versions of sachet and bag spells can be found across different cultures and traditions. 

Often stashed in a strategic location or carried on your person.


**SUGGESTED USES:** protection spells to carry in a bag or purse, protection spells to stash in a vehicle, spells for love and attraction or to be noticed, dream or sleep-related sachets that get stashed in a pillowcase or under the bed, lust/passion sachets for storing near the bed, success spells that need to be carried to a job interview or audition, glamour spells for boosting charisma or confidence, glamours for invisibility.


###**Possible substitutions with similar symbolism:**

•A sock, tied off with a knot  
•Cloth scraps, spare fabric  
•Drawstring bags or pouches  
•Coin purses or little makeup bags/pencil cases  
•An envelope  
•A folded up piece of paper  
•A toilet paper roll, glued shut at each end  

---

#SIMMER POTS:

Simmer pots are made by simmering magickal ingredients in a pot of water on the stove. The rising steam releases your intention, and fills your home with specific types of energy. 

Common components include herbs and spices, fruits, flowers, oils, and resins.

**You can make a simmer pot for any magickal goal:**

Protection, cleansing, peace and tranquility, health and healing, attracting love, money, luck, success, or simply general blessings.

---

#RITUAL BATHS:

Ritual baths are unrelated to physical hygiene. 

Most people are likely somewhat familiar with baths for [spiritual cleansing and uncrossing](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/s/DZNdvQC5QW), but you can also use ritual baths for enchanting yourself and attracting various blessings and energy!

Depending on the ingredients used, you can create baths for a number of purposes, such as: beauty, creating glamours, attracting love or money, protection, improving intuition and divination, etc.

**In “Protection and Reversal Magick”, Jason Miller suggests:**

>•Washing from your head down to your toes, when banishing or cleansing.
>
>•Washing from your toes up toward your head when attracting something. 

---

#DUSTS & POWDERS:

Magickal powders are often used as ingredients in various spells. Sometimes, though, the dust or powder *IS* the spell.

These kinds of spells usually depend on the location of their placement, or in their contact with the spell's target. 

**Some examples:**

•Sprinkling a protective mixture across thresholds or window sills to keep negative energy out. 

•Adding money dust to your wallet.

•Sprinkling where a targeted person will walk (such as with hot foot powder).



---

#POPPETS & DOLLS:

Poppets are a fundamental component of sympathetic magick. They've long been used in various folk traditions around the world, both to harm and also to heal. 

The purpose of a doll or a poppet is to become a stand-in for the target of your spell. By adding a taglock of your target to the doll, you create the required sympathetic link.

**SUGGESTED USES:** place inside jar spells for hexing or sweetening, place inside mirror boxes, place inside protective boxes, fill with protective herbs or healing herbs or cleansing herbs, fill with baneful herbs, tie up with string to bind someone, use in love or attraction spells, use to represent yourself in spellwork, anoint with various magickal oils.

---

#KNOTS & CORDS:

Witches ladder

Prayer flags

Cords as symbolic (cord cutting, binding)

---

#KITCHEN WITCHERY:

Edible spells and brews!

---

#SPOKEN SPELLS:

Verbal spells are some one of the oldest forms of spellcasting. 



**Spoken magick includes:** 

•Reciting psalms and biblical verses  
•prayers  
•chants  
•incantations  
•invocations to spirits  
•commanding phrases  
•spoken blessings and curses

1lzydqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/helsinki/comments/1lzydqm/best_matcha_latte_in_town/,Best Matcha Latte in town,"I love Matcha. Well before any of the recent trends, I started drinking these green lattes back in 2007. I have a bit of sweettooth, so I don't really like anything bitter. What I usually do to balance this out without having any sweetener is to just have a cocos matcha.

Over the past year, I've poked around Helsinki looking for good places to have a nice ML.

Here is a list of the top places that come to mind for me in Helsinki:

Best:  
\- Torrefazione (Kamppi and Lasipalaatsi): 10/10 (if it's a cocos matcha)  
\- Matcha Crew (Lapinlahdenkatu): 9/10 (these guys know what they're doing)  
\- ARKET Store Cafe (Aleksanterinkatu): 8/10 (this was a nice random find)  
\- Mini Kitchen (Fredrikinkatu): 8/10 (this was a nice find)  
\- St George Cafe: 7.5/10 (classic)  
\- Round (Iso Roba): 7/10  
\- Enchante (Eerikinkatu): 7/10 (nice large cup ... the owner is super cool too)  
\- Kaffa Roastery (Pursimiehenkatu): 7/10 (more of a coffee place but they do have some Matcha knowhow)

Mid:  
\- Adante Coffee: 6.5/10 -> worth a shot  
\- Levain (Pursimiehenkatu): 6.5 -> if you're in the area then maybe  
\- Any Espresso House: 5/10 -> too much sugar  
\- Starbucks (Espanlandi) 5/10 -> nobody knows how to make it here ... it's not like it is elsewhere in the world

Shit:  
\- Not gonna name any places, but if you come across a place that does a ""iced matcha"" then it usually garbage when it's served as a latte  
\- Also, most non latte places give too little matcha so you're basically drinking a ""green watered down hot chocolate"". So do ask for more.  
\- If coconut then go cocos

She looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. I had to explain how drinking their double IPA first would completely destroy my ability to appreciate the nuances in their pilsner. 

I've started bringing a little notebook where I've pre-planned the optimal tasting sequence based on ABV, bitterness units, and flavor intensity and now I can't fathom ordering random flights with no consideration for how the flavors will interact. 

I watched some guy go from coffee stout to wheat beer to sour ale like he was playing flavor roulette and wondered how his amateur progression would affect the Untappd ratings so I've been thinking about offering to design proper tasting flights for breweries since most of them just arrange beers at random instead of by flavor progression.

Jess’ sensible Volvo pulls up at a dilapidated church on the outskirts of Los Angeles.  The sun is low in the sky but not set, just enough that my stylish suit isn’t quite causing the sweat to prickle on my collar in defiance of the wool’s quality.  The things I do for fashion.  We exit the car and immediately following the savory goodness of a nearby taqueria is the distinct taste of a powerful anomaly in my mouth.

 

“Jackpot” I say to Jess. “This is it.  Keep your eyes peeled though. We don’t know if this place is monitored.  It looks empty now but it might not stay that way.  If things to sour, I want you to leave.  I can take care of myself, got it?”  
  
“Shut up” Jess replies as she exits the Volvo after me.  We approach the church, the widows boarded up and the whitewash paint cracked and peeling.  The air itself tastes like burnt sugar and grave dirt.  Spent candles line the window sill, unlit for long enough that the smell of hot wax is nowhere to be found. The Church of the True Form would hold meetings weekly here once upon a time but now its fallen into obvious disrepair.  I think we are in the clear.

 

The building isn’t just abandoned, it’s condemned.  Caution tape is on the ground near the doorways where the staples holding it have failed.  Spiderwebs are absolutely everywhere and threaten to muss my suit.  Uncivilized to let a building decay like this.  I pull a small pen flashlight from my jacket pocket and shine it around.  I don’t see anything, I didn’t really expect to given what the briefing said about the anomalous locks protecting this treasure.  “How are you doing jess?  You good?” I ask, checking in on my new protégé.

 

“Fine. I’ve lived in worse place than this.” She spits out.  We walk to a room behind an altar and I am almost overwhelmed with a mix of sweet and disgusting flavors in my mouth like Halloween candy covered in fermented cabbage and motor oil.  “Jess, it’s in here. You scared?” I ask

 

“No.” She responds.  “Well….stop that.  Get scared.  We need some emotion to get some good luck or we are never gonna find this thing.  It’s here somewhere damn it.” I pass my hand along the floor. “Shit before I forget take these dice”  I reach into a jacket pocket and pull out three dice.  “When I eventually find this thing and its perception altering lock, things might bet weird.  I might blink in and out of reality.  Hell it might be fully anti memetic and you’ll forget I exist in the first place.  Just repeat after me. I roll the dice and I want sixes.”

 

She takes the dice and repeats “I roll the dice and I want sixes” I grin.  “perfect!  Now I feel like we must be getting clo-“ and suddenly I completely vanish from Jess’s reality.  She blinks for a moment and struggles to remember why she came here in the first place.  There was a market or something?  And a steak with fries? And a cult?  She struggles to remember and as she balls her fists the dice push into her palm.  Where did they come from?  She remembers saying to herself “I roll the dice and I want sixes”  but she can’t recall why.  Her heart rate jumps.  She thinks for a moment and decides to repeat it again “I roll the dice and I want sixes” and she rolls the dice.

 

Two dice roll into sixes and the third seems to hesitate for a moment as if opposing forces are pushing it in two different directions. It seems to decide to display a third six and I pop back into existence along with her memories of me.  The entire room seems to shift as the locks are broken like a silent shockwave from an enormous bomb. “Hey!  Good job rookie!” As the relic comes into view with me, she feels a definite shift somehow.  I look to where the relic once sat and a pressure sensitive switch is very clearly now telling someone, somewhere, that we found their trinket. Jess feels a wave of emptiness, like she feels flat.  She looks to me with horror.  “What…what happened to you?!” I look down at my hand and see aged and wrinkled flesh like crepe paper. My crisp pink tie hanging loose on a throat gone wattled and thin.  I cough and a dot of blood lands on the lip that Jess had split not terribly long ago.  I stand and my joints creak as I hobble away from the statue of Horus “Just keep it away from me! Fuck!  Let’s go before I need fucking hip surgery”  I limp slowly toward the Volvo after Jess.  She unceremoniously throws the statue toward the Volvo and turns to help me walk. An alarm sounds from the old church and a flashing red light can be seen inside.  She half drags, half carries me at an agonizingly slow pace toward our escape, my once-shiny Italian loafers scuffing on the asphalt as I drag my feet.  A white van comes around a corner a few blocks away.  She tosses the statue in the far back and I slowly and painfully sit in the front seat, moaning as I set down “Fuck just get this piece of shit back to the market as fast as you can god damn it” I croak out in the voice of a geriatric.  I feel heavy and tired and rusted and in pain. I fumble with the seatbelt twice with skeletal hands before I finally manage to get it clasped and rest my head against the passenger window as Jess runs every red light to get us back to the market as fast as we can.  I taste nothing at all.

 

Jess screeches to a halt in front of the market as she runs out with the statue of Horus.  She shouts to the valets “He needs help!  Get him!” before running inside directly to orders processing.  I sit in the passenger seat.  My hair is a few gray strands clinging to my scalp.  My beard white and stringy.  My papery skin covered in liver spots. It hurts to breathe but I feel a little better being out of the presence of that cursed statue.  I’ve felt this before once, long ago. Before I understood Evelyn.

 

Jess arrives at orders processing and frantically hands the statue over to Evelyn “Just do whatever it is you do!  This thing fucked David UP.  He looked…like he was dying.  But I’m okay I think.  Just….what is it?  What does it do?”

 

Evelyn examines it carefully from all angles.  And sits with it for a moment.  Her crimson lips pursed into a look of concentration. The lights flicker and Evelyn has a strange sort of infinite depth to her, like two mirrors facing each other. Finally she speaks.  “It’s like me.  A nullifier.  But smaller and more intense than anything we’ve found yet.”

 

“Why the fuck would that almost kill David?” Jess asks in frustration.  She balls her hands in her hair and paces back and forth as Evelyn sends the artifact off to Research and Development.  I stumble back into the room looking considerably better than I did in the car.  Skin is clearer, more hair on my head.  “Well that was unpleasant.” I say as I sit and catch my breath.  “a Nullifier. Something on the same order of power as Evelyn, maybe even more so.  It all tracks.  It would protect Crowley from any anomalous enemy he would have had such as a broker and would help the Church of the True Form in their mission to destroy what they call “Abominations”.  You did good out there, Jess.  I know that was, frankly, weird as fuck.  But you got the job done and you didn’t lose your head when I went to hell.  The Market made the right decision with you.  I’m glad to have you aboard.” I have a brief coughing fit and relax for a moment.  “Someone knows their trinket is gone, which means they know we have a few tools in our toolbox we didn’t have before.  Rolling three sixes at once is close to a thousand to one odds so they know we have probability manipulation on our side, and they know we can see through their perception tricks.  I don’t like them knowing stuff.  My vote is to steer clear of anything related to the zealots for a while until we can piece together exactly what is happening” My hair and skin are nearly back to what they were this morning.  Jess cocks her head as if she’s about to say something but doesn’t. Out in the marketplace a real estate mogul buys a woman a third his age a diamond tennis bracelet and a tech billionaire is fitted with a bespoke suit for an investors meeting. An oil baron negotiates the price of rare cheese with the merchant and I shake the arthritis from my hands. The garish pink of my tie even more flamboyant against my still unnaturally-pale skin. I don’t like that feeling at all.  I’m not ready to feel that.  I have so much work left to do.

# 2        Chapter 10 – Neolithic through babylon

 

It’s getting cold and the days are growing short.  The leaves have all fallen from the trees and there is no more fruit.  The women can barely break the ground for roots.  The great beasts should arrive soon and we will have full bellies again.  The great beasts aways come when it is cold and brought with them a bounty that will sustain us through the cold days.  They always have in my time, and my father’s time, and his father before him. They are beautiful in a way and we respect them.  As large as twenty men, covered in hair like a woman’s.  Two teeth extend from their faces like tree branches and their nose is like an arm strong enough to break a bone if the hunt is not organized right.  The ones that came before us taught us the way.  The small beasts we catch in the warmer days are skittish, they run when approached.  Run much faster than men but they are stupid so we chase them to a trap and we eat well for the day.  The Great Beasts are not like the small beasts at all.  They turn and face us and do not back down because they are used to being mighty.  My people are scarce now, the Great Beasts likely see us only once in their lives.  My brothers and I take up our spears t leave behind the elders and the women.  The great beasts are coming and we will eat well.

 

The elders come to bless the hunting party.  My brothers and I will track the Great Beasts.  We are given herbs gathered in the spring to give us strength and suppress our hunger as we hunt, and we are told that the that the Great Beast will always choose the hunter worthy of its life, that it gives us the greatest gift anything that walks on the earth can give and that we must be thankful and humble in its presence. We use the techniques we learned from our fathers.  Dressed in the fur of the wolf and the bear we walk the paths we knew the Great Beasts to walk until we find evidence they were here.  Broken branches, footprints in the snow.  Then we know we are close. For four days we walked through the snow searching, and for two of them we had no food but the bark of trees to fill our stomachs before we saw it.  A great beast, lumbering alone through the snow.  The elders told me they walk this path at the end of their lives, that they are a gift from the gods and that it is an honor for a Great Beast to fall at the spear of men. That it brings purpose to their lives for without becoming meat they are doomed to lumber until they stumble and fall and look back on a life that was nothing more than eating and walking.  The elders said the great beasts were nearly as smart as a man but they were cursed to live without hands that could carve the tools or paint the rocks as we did.  I don’t know.  I’m hungry and so are my people.

 

Even on empty stomachs, men can walk vast distances compared to the great beasts.  We know this.  We simply follow them until they must rest and then we can get close.  They fight back but their meat will sustain our whole tribe for the cold months.  One life will sustain thirty. When it rises to its feet and roars its mighty roar at me, my brother leaps from behind a tree and buries a spear deep in its ribs.  The Great Beast turns to impale him on his long teeth and a second brother leaps from behind a second tree and the spear pierces its belly.  It lets out a loud sad cry and falls to its knees.  The snow is painted red from its blood.  Just as I believe the Great Beast has lost its fight it whips its head to the side and one of its tree branch teeth pierce my side and tear ribs and guts from my body, scattering them against a tree.  My brothers cry out for me and one drives his spear into the throat of the Great Beast as my own blood spills into the snow, mixing with its.  The hunt is a success, my people will eat well.  My brother comes to my side and shakes me.  I see his mouth shouting but I can’t hear his voice.  The gaping wound in my side are a lost cause.  I raise my arm to touch his face and the world goes black.  My brothers must bring the meat back to the tribe, the cold will preserve me long enough to return and give me the burial I deserve.

 

I awake alone.  It was night and the lights were in the sky, swirling green as they do sometimes in the cold days.  The elders said this was a river that spirits traveled to where spirits go when their bodies will no longer hold them.  My side hurts fiercely.  I looked down to my broken body and see that the great gaping hole has been replaced by a scabbed over patch.  An unfamiliar flavor was in my mouth like meat burned by cooking too close to the fire and yet sweet like ripe fruit.  The blood is not flowing anymore.  I tentatively touch where my rib was torn free and a small replacement is already beginning to grow.  The elders taught me that the brightest star in the sky does not spin as the rest of them do, and its direction is always constant.  I find my bearings and attempt to stand up.  The pain is almost overwhelming but my soul remains in my body and so I will continue to contribute to my people as I always have.  My wife and my children are no doubt well now that they have full bellies but I need to tell them that I survived and I am there for them.  As long as my body will hold my soul I will always be there for them.  I began to walk

 

Two days of steady walking and I find my people where they were.  Initially they greeted me with their spears out and their teeth bared, expecting a rival or a thief come to take their well-earned kill.  I greeted them with a friendly wave and their war faces turned to happy cheers as they recognized me coming over a hill.  My brothers ran to meet me and touched the wound in my side, now nearly gone.  The elders of my time and examined the wound.  No herbs or binding or blessings and a mortal wound had healed itself in mere days?  The head elder hesitated a moment, having seen and treated many wounds in her many days.  She said this is not the blessing of our people, it is not the blessing of our gods, that a stranger-god had found me among the trees.  She said this was a god playing a game with the men and women of our people, she called it a test.  The elders debated for a while.

 

The elders vanished for a time to discuss this matter and they agreed this was a blessing beyond what they had known before they concluded that saving the life of a good man could not be a curse. They found this cause for celebration and they brought out the preserved ceremonial herbs we used only in times of great joy or great sorrow and we all laughed through the night.  My wife and children happily hugged and kissed me and welcomed me back.  The gods have blessed me so many times and I am grateful to be chosen.

 

My brothers grew old and passed on.  And so did their children, and their children’s children.  My hair has not so much as been given the elder’s honor of turning white.  My wife and our children…

 

The elders told me I had been given a task by our gods, to see over our people for all time.  The gods had chosen me and given me a piece of their own heart in mine.  That this was the greatest honor a man could possibly have.  The elders were born in the age of my children.

 

One year the cold days came but the great beasts didn’t.  Instead came a great sickness among my people.  Sores grew on our skin, coughing would keep us up at night.  Pain in our joints and muscles, even mine.  I found myself sleeping most of the day and night for there wasn’t much else to do.  Every morning I would wake to hear less and less coughing. By the time the warm days came again I was alone and the mornings were silent.  I press my palm to the earth and feel no footsteps nor drums.  I hear no crying of mothers for their children.  I buried the young and old myself, muttering the names I would come to forget.  The elders would say that the gods blessed us every day by giving us a sunrise and that they blessed us every night by taking the sun back. Maybe that’s where they were, where the sun rose.  Maybe I should ask them why my people were taken from me. I looked to where the sun rose every morning and I did the only thing I could think to do.  I began to walk.

 

I walked and wandered, secure in the knowledge that if not a Great Beast nor a famine nor the sickness that took my people would keep me down then very little in this world could.  I think I befriended an abandoned wolf cub for a while before he grew and died.  I think he had a name.  After countless sunrises and cold days and warm days I walked over a hill to see something I had never seen before.  Not tens, but hundreds of men and women.  Thousands even!  I was baffled, more men and women than I had seen in my long life combined, living in houses carved from the earth harmoniously.  I had to learn more.  They wore finer clothing than I had seen, coverings on their feet woven intricately from the plants of the area.  They tended to neat fields of grains and kept sheep in pens.  My crude coverings of animal pelts made me feel more like a beast from the forest than a man compared to these people.  Were they really the same as the people that raised me?

 

They were welcoming and I learned their ways.  They traded with other cities for things they could not build themselves.  Seashells and flint were traded for the excesses of pottery and peas and wool we could produce.  I took a job, my first.  I was a potter and a storyteller and soon became a celebrated one.  The city had a name, Chatalhoyuk, and there I learned that the world was far larger than the elders had ever told me.  That there were great cities of men in the deserts and by the seas and in the plains.  When I arrived they had no kings and traded freely among themselves and the travelers that would come from further east until eventually a man began preaching about new gods and the wickedness of men.  Many believed him.  He claimed his god would guide him and his people and demanded tithings of grain and flint and meat.  His words resonated with many and soon he was hoarding the grain, distributing it as he saw fit.  The obedient ones were fed, the disobedient ones were deemed wicked and left to fend for themselves.  His words didn’t resonate with me.  The gods the elders told me about didn’t need grain.  They didn’t ask anything of the men who walked on the earth.  All the gods asked was to respect the gifts that were given and to be kind to one another, and that no man stood taller than any other, even the elders.  We were taught the elders were to be respected for their wisdom and their insight not merely for their title.  I didn’t like this new priest.  I didn’t like the crown he wore on his head.  Before long he installed himself as the sole source of truth among my new people and I remained silent until the hair of the ones who welcomed me turned gray and mine did not and the whispering began.  I was accused of being an old god sent to topple the king and before long the attention was on me in a way I never wanted.  If this is the curse I must live with I needed rules.  Never stay, never lead, never love.  With the clothes on my back and a sack of carving tools I escaped one night and didn’t look back.  Again, I began to walk.

 

Cities began to spread rapidly it seemed.  People began to store their thoughts and their business in words on clay tablets or on animal skins.  They began to tabulate the harvest, calculate yields of meat and milk and grain.  My pattern was clear for eons from there.  Find a new city, take a new name, learn their ways and find a profession.  Occasionally a strange taste would come into my mouth as I traveled.  Sometimes like spiced honey, sometimes like rotten meat, sometimes like ash.  As I continued east there were many men in crowns that claimed their god was the true god and I dutifully nodded to keep my profile low.  I learned of metal and leather and gold and jewels.  Fine things that the men in crowns kill over.  I learned of salt and spices and luxury reserved for the kings and priests that were guarded.  Eventually I found myself in a city beyond anything I could have imagined before.  Babylon.

 

Babylon stood head and shoulders above anywhere I had been before.  The ornate buildings and fine clothing showed me the unbelievable greatness man could achieve. I was found useful for my knowledge of many crafts and soon found myself employed among the royalty and compensated well for my expertise in metallurgy, helping craft the coins that would be the currency of the city.  The king would consult with me on matters of city planning and economy and respected my opinions.  He seemed to be a kind man and I wore fine clothes in those days.  I was invited to oversee the construction of a new temple and I obliged. 

 

A Ziggurat, a massive temple that they claimed would house one of the gods themselves.  Great blocks of stone were pulled on wooden rollers by slaves.  One stumbled and fell and a bare chested man leveled a whip on her back as the king laid out his great plan for the space.  I hid my disgust as I watched the treatment of the workers and nodded politely.  That night I snuck into the slave quarters and gave them bread and meat and fresh water.  When I stood near the woman I saw whipped before there was a taste like stone in my mouth that intensified as I drew closer to her.  She smirked when she saw me. 

 

“Hello, ancient one.” She said. For the first time in ages, I was afraid. “I’m hardly ancient, young lady.” I tried to play it off as if she was merely teasing.

 

“You are.  Your secrets cannot hide from me.  But don’t worry, I won’t tell.  To live a life like yours and not take up a title of a god or a king is a sign that your heart is a good one.  Thank you for the meat and bread”

 

I stare at her a moment in silence then leave the slave quarters without locking the door.  Quietly I make my way to the barracks where the guards keep their whips and their weapons and I burn it to the ground.  A woman who could see my secrets and made me taste stone in my mouth.  The world truly is larger than I believed it was.  Babylon was no home for me anymore.

 

 

# 3        Chapter 11 – Silas

 

It’s early.  Too early, frankly, after dealing with the shit I did yesterday.  My back hurts but I’ll be okay. I rise up out of  my plush bed in the apartment I’ve live in since I started at the Market.  Except nights where I’m on the road in search of more miracles, that is.  I walk to the bathroom mirror wearing pajama pants and no shirt, inspecting my body for liver spots and wrinkles.  They’ve all faded away overnight but crows feet by my eyes linger.  Maybe they’ve always been there, I don’t know.  In the closet is a motorized tie rack with various pink ties of different hue and pattern. I choose one that looks different to me but will go unnoticed by everyone else.  They have no sense of style.  Dressed fully, I make my way down to the coffee shop and am surprised to see Jess waiting for me already.

 

“You look better” She says as she drinks a coffee and pushes one toward me, both in large and refreshingly simple paper cups like you would find at a normal café. “I feel better.  Thank you.” I say, taking the cup and having a long sip.  A red envelope flutters down on cue and the corner nearly catches me in the eye.  Jess and I look at each other a moment and up to where the envelope materialized from but as always there’s nothing to see. 

“It’s got bot our names on it” Jess observes while taking a bite of a butter croissant.  “Indeed it does.” I respond, opening it with my pocketknife. Jess snatches the contents from me before I have a chance to read it.  “Oh cool.  Looks like Administration heard word that an anomaly was found in the ruins of Pompeii.  It’s got a bit more details here than the last one.” She chews and swallows.  “Remarkably well preserved and it may have some sort of low level ‘emotion shifting” anomaly and we are to examine it and Broker a deal for it!”  She looks like a kid with a new toy.  I remember Pompeii vividly.  I can almost smell my vineyard and taste the wine we would drink together. I remember the dog that choked on acrid air until it died in my lap.  I saved nobody that day.  I swallow.  “So it’s already found its way into a private collection.  That can be potentially dangerous, the human element is unpredictable.  What is the item exactly?” I drink my coffee pointedly

 

“a scroll of records from a vineyard that got obliterated when the volcano went off and the residue for all that pain landed on the scroll.  Some nearby hotshot thought it was fascinating and bought it before a museum could snatch it up. Seems like a standup guy though, Marcus Vale.  Owns a bunch of restaurants all over the world, donates a bunch of money to libraries and schools, seems to have a weird emo streak and collects everything from sad clown paintings to funeral masks.  Weird.”

 

I buried that scroll with the dog.  It was the last piece of that home I had.  They robbed that grave.  People have robbed lots of graves at Pompeii but this annoys me for some reason. “So he’s in Greece somewhere?”  I ask.

 

Jess reads further “Looks like he came to us.  His yacht is just off the coast and Administration assigned him to us.  I’ve never been on a Yacht!  Fuck yes I’m getting a mimosa.” I hold my hand up. “I understand your excitement but this is still a job and we will behave professionally.  Mimosas after.” I finish my coffee and set off for the garage with Jess at my side. We make our way down to the garage and Jess insists on taking the same boxy Volvo as before.  “It’s good luck and I’m an authority on luck, so get in” she teasingly commands.  I oblige and slide into the passenger side and we make our way for the Docks at the port of Long Beach.

 

It's a relatively short drive by southern California standards and we park a short walk from where a 100 foot yacht is anchored.  A staircase leads up to the main deck and they are expecting us.  We both nod politely in silence to the security guard next to the stairs and make our way up.

 

Marcus Vale sits on the deck in a white suit and a tank top underneath.  His hair is dyed black and he wears a garish gold chain around his neck.  He rises and smiles politely, giving us both firm handshakes.  “Welcome!  Welcome!  Please come, sit.  Can I get you anything?  Wine?  Whiskey?  Mimosa?” Jess shoots me a look and I wave his offer off “No thank you Mr. Vale-“ “Marcus, please.” He cuts me off

 

“Very well, Marcus.  I’m afraid we are here for business and business alone but your hospitality is appreciated.  I understand you are looking to sell an unusual recordkeeping scroll unearthed in Pompeii.”  I taste a bitter electric taste, like licking a nine volt battery.  Behind it is something like rotten honey, something unsettlingly familiar.

 

“You bet your ass I am!  Cost me a pretty penny to get my hands on it before it got sent to rot in some museum somewhere. And when they said this thing was weird BOY were they right!  I’ve always sort of had this thrill seeker mentality, you know?  You get your emotions all ramped up and come back down…like when you watch a movie or go on a rollercoaster.  And that’s exactly what this is! It’s incredible.” He sits back on a seat and drinks a glass of wine.  It’s not even 10 am.  “Now I’m well connected enough to know that you all don’t just sell Rolexes and fancy suits and all that.  I know you have resources that I don’t to deal with stuff that doesn’t play by the rules.  It’s cool!  I think that’s good work!  That’s why I think you guys should have it.  Imagine some politician somewhere who could make everyone sad and sympathetic to his pet pork project.  Nah, I’ve seen what it can do and I’m looking for a buyer and I like you guys from what I know.  All I want is fair compensation.”

 

I study his face for a moment.  I don’t detect any deception.  “Very well.  Name your price.”

 

Marcus give a single loud clap “boy you are just all business today aren’t you?  Fine.  Twenty pounds of five-nines gold bars.  Inflation-proof, baby!” He is clearly mildly inebriated already.  A quick bit of mental math puts that at about 1.1 million dollars in today’s exchange rate.  “That is a fair price, Marcus.” I extend my hand for a shake.  The rotten honey taste becomes more distinct and overtakes the battery taste.  I look around “May we see the merchandise then?”

 

“Of course!” He turns and yells to staff below deck “Hey!  We got ourselves a god damn deal, get up here.”  A member of wait staff wearing a black vest and looking like a waiter comes up from below deck carrying a briefcase. He sets it down and opens it up.  I pick the object up and the proximity to it gives me an almost overwhelming taste of bitter battery.  It sends me back to when I could see the ash and hear the screaming and the last wheezing breaths before the dog died.  “Funny thing is nobody seems to be able to translate some of these markings.  Round Pompeii they had their own sort of dialect I guess.  Outside of the numbers I cant find anyone who can make heads or tails over what it says.”  
  


“They’re names.  Customers and suppliers, delivery dates for celebrations” I study the margins of the scroll intently “all silenced at once when that mountain exploded”

 

In rapid succession I am suddenly hit with the rotten honey taste again and the sadness and pain of the scroll is amplified a hundredfold. Everyone on the boat writhes in pain except one man, his hand extended toward the scroll with a wicked grin on his face.  He’s slim and young but older than I remember.  A prominent scar down his stubbled cheek that I don’t remember.  Black hair is styled neatly on his head.  Dressed all in black, purely tactical

 

“Good to see you again, old man.” He snatches the scroll and the power is amplified even further.  The guards cower and shoot at hallucinations.  I’m paralyzed with the crushing failure of saving not a single soul all those years ago.  Jess crawls on the ground toward the thief but the overwhelming weight of all that pain and suffering and death might as well be bags of cement on her back.  “He’s buried more people than you know, rookie.” The man says as he exits the yacht and makes his way down to a waiting sedan with the engine left running.  I sit with a broken mind for a while, muttering names of dead friends in a Latin dialect that died in the explosion.  By the time we come to our senses Marcus is still sitting in his seat, catatonic and looking out over the water.  “Sir, are you okay?” I ask as I set my hand on his shoulder.  He pauses a moment then shakes his head “Not right now I’m not.  But I will be.”

 

“Your payment will be delivered within 24 hours as promised.  We appreciate your time and consideration, Marcus.  I hope you have a good rest of your day.” With a polite nod I exit the boat and Jess follows behind.  “Hang on hang on wait” Jess calls from behind.  I pause at the bottom of the stairs. “Your weird outdated slang, you read dead languages, you’re muttering names in latin while half comatose, you’re not actually a millennial at all are you?” and she pokes me in the chest accusingly. I take a breath.  “No, Jess.  I’m not.  I’m quite a bit older than that.  Those people in that scroll were my customers.  They were my friends.  They drank my wine on the last night of their lives and I couldn’t even save a single one of them.” A brief pause. “We have bigger fish to fry right now though.  You ever wonder what happens when someone gets fired from the Market?” I gesture off in the general direction the thief took off in.  “He believed that our ethics were handcuffs rather than guardrails.  That the horrible power we kept in our archives could be used correctly if only the right person was in charge.  He believed that killing the wicked was a quicker and easier way to bring about a better world.  That, Jess, is Silas Grant.  Your predecessor and now our problem.”",1,1752526530.0,CapitalM,0,1.0,False

The Painter

“Are you waiting for something?”, asked the young man showing me the way. Between us and our destination was only a trench, a few hundred meters wide. It belonged to an open pit mine, part of which stretched like a scar through the urban landscape. On the other side there was a group of sturdy stone buildings that looked almost medieval. An eerie but somehow inviting yellow light was coming from them, illuminating the fading dusk above. I had taken a moment at the foot of the wide reinforced bridge that stretched across the expanse to observe the activity in the mine. Well, I rather tried to remember how I even got here. 

I had been walking through the park on a sunny afternoon and had somehow gotten into a conversation with a stranger, who simply seemed to be the kind of person to talk to curious passers by and show a piece of herself. In fact she showed me multiple pieces of hers - she was a painter at work. One of her creations showed a thick blue candle that had just been blown out, marked by cute trails of smoke that almost appeared to be moving. If the artist did tell me her name, it completely slipped past me. I will call her Lucy for the sake of the story. I cannot remember what she looked like but noticed she was a tiny bit older than I.

Her art was not merely visual. It had the power to awaken inner worlds of the beholder, completely immersing them, making them forget themself and the real world for a moment. The color of the candle quickly turned into a full vision or dream of an open sea surrounding myself standing on a small boat. As I looked down at myself there was no solid body but only the deep blue of the water. It felt as if I was one with the ocean, supporting and moving the boat rather than being its passenger. I wish I could recall the other artworks she had shown me. I was intrigued; I wanted to see more of her work, so I gladly accepted when Lucy invited me to her home for dinner.

As we entered the house and I followed her into the kitchen, I was greeted by a 3-year-old at the top of the scene sitting on a tall cabinet. The toddler was playing with a slice of bread. He was apparently trusted to eventually figure out what he was supposed to do with it. A strong-built woman was looking after him while preparing food at the stove. I assumed she was in a romantic or co-parenting relationship with the artist since she did not seem to be a housekeeper but instead an integral part of the family. Lucy introduced a young short man with glasses to me as her little brother. He seemed a little intimidated by me as I was a few years older than him. At the very least he was being overly polite – we were complete strangers after all – but ultimately radiating a kindness that he shared with the women.

From the size of their home and pictures throughout the living room I could tell that there were other folks living here who did not join for dinner that day. We sat down at a warm colored hardwood table that was more the height of a coffee table. All around were all kinds of seats and a sofa. I decided to go for a comfortable pillow on the floor as it was the perfect height for me to eat and sat down criss-cross applesauce. I felt like, if I did not have a place to go, they would just adopt me and love and treat me like a sibling. Lucy suggested her brother show me her studio, which was not far away, so I could look at more of her paintings.

So as we were about to cross the bridge and I stopped for a moment to look at the mine he said something along the lines of urgently needing to go to the bathroom. He sprinted ahead and across the pit while I passed for another second lost in my thoughts. As I watched autonomous vehicles beneath me hauling today’s worth of copper ore I tried to remind myself of the experience I had had just earlier, the brief glimpse into this art form that so inspired me.

I currently live in a relatively middle class suburb with 6 of my family members under the same roof. We're probably the only poor people in this entire town because the house we're living in was inherited. My grandma might be selling the house, and my family can't decide on an area to live together (not to mention that the money from this house would make it very difficult to buy another one with enough bedrooms), so we just decided it'd be best to divide the money and let people move where they wanna move. I wont get into that much more though.

Growing up around here, I've always felt extremely judged for being poor. Like extremely. When I was a kid I was made fun of for not having good clothes and stuff, and while I really don't give a fuck about people not liking me, it sucks living in an area where I'm constantly judged just for walking down the street. I've had people yell ""get a job loser"", as if I'm not working thrice the amount as them just to leave the neighborhood (I have to rely on transit that comes once an hour because I can't afford a car, I'm basically the only person in the entire area that relies on public transit... the lone person at the bus stop).

Basically, I wanna move to an area where I fit in. Say what you want about poor areas, I've spent a shit ton of time in them, and I've always felt accepted there. There's community, plenty of people accept me (even as an outsider), and there ain't a better place to get a meal. Even with my portion, I wouldn't be able to afford rent in a middle class area anyway, so there's not much choice. I'll have a friend coming with me as a roommate and we have to be able to cover rent together once my portion of the money runs out, so I need an area with relatively low rent prices. I have a pretty high level of street smarts, and I know how to carry myself, so I should be fine in most places.

I'll define loose by the way: An area that isn't dangerous to the point of an active war zone, but is relatively lax in terms of stuff like block parties, playing loud music, etc. I kinda think of areas like Northeast Philly when I say that (or if we wanna get fictional, the neighborhood in Shameless). There's crime to an extent, it's rough around the edges, but there's not like 6 shootings a day on the same block. I'd look into moving there but that region of Philly is too expensive (and I'm trying to get out of Pennsylvania anyway).

**What I'm looking for is:**

* An area in a relatively medium or large city.
* At least some access to public transit (I can't afford a car).
* Community is extremely important to me.
* A loose area. I don't care about seeing stuff like drugs, homeless people, the occasional fight/violent crime, non-fatal robberies, etc.
* A neighborhood that is accepting of all races (I don't care if it's majority white or majority POC, I'm just looking for an accepting place. I hate being around racist white people, and there are definitely some majority POC areas with rightful light prejudice (NOT RACISM!!! very important difference) towards white people that I'm still not really looking for. Not looking to go to an area where I make other people uncomfortable, I figure that in areas like the south segregation might still be relatively heavy, not too sure though).
* An area with some form of community hotspot to get everything you need (an example would be an NYC bodega. You got coffee, sandwiches, drinks, etc, it's also a social place).

**What I'm not looking for is:**

* An active war zone (I'm not looking for a place where the block I live on gets shot up all the time)
* A heavily gentrified/gentrifying area (I can't afford one, nor would I want to. Not a dime of my money will go to those shitty developers that thrive from preying on the poor).
* An area where I'll be judged simply for existing as a poor person.
* An area in an extremely distant suburb or rural area. (I'm fine with a cheap suburb if it's right next to a city and I can get there quickly by transit. I need to be in the city for school and work opportunity.)
* An area that isn't walkable. At least somewhat decent walkability is a requirement.
* Cities that don't do well with asthma. (I was looking into Pittsburgh and Detroit, but then learned that they're terrible for asthma. I'm not diagnosed with it yet, but I have a lot of symptoms and my doctors think I might have it. Don't wanna take the chance of moving somewhere that could literally kill me breathing wise).

The previous owners told us how much they enjoyed having coffee on this deck every morning.  

It's hard to tell from the photo, but the only support post is on the far right corner.  The near corner is simply resting on the ground.  The ""beam"" in the front is three pieces placed end to end and sistered with a few nails.  If you zoom, you can see how each one has sagged a couple inches, so there's a noticeable pitch towards the far right corner.  

I don't have a photo of the other deck, which was slightly better built except for a variable 12""-36"" joist spacing, which gave the trex decking a nice bouncy feel and roller coaster appearance.

1lzy3pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalM/comments/1lzy3pt/chapters_56_v10/,Chapters 5-6 (v1.0),"# Chapter 5 – Edgar’s Emporium

 

Jess sits stunned for a moment and then speaks “Gods.” She states plainly

 

“Or at least the closest thing I’ve ever seen to them.  Humanity creates, it builds.  It makes things in its own image.  From what I read that’s godly behavior.  I think there is limitless potential in humanity and it’s my life’s work now to realize that potential.  Will we all be perfect some day?  I doubt that.  But we can be better.  Did you want any dessert?  Hank makes the absolute best cheesecake I’ve ever had.”

 

Hank waves again from the kitchen “Sluttiest damn cheesecake you ever had, darlin’!”

 

Jess is stuffed from the heavy meal but snorts at calling a cheesecake “slutty”

 

“Maybe next time Hank, thank you!” She calls over to him.

 

I stand and straighten my suit, then tuck in the chair gently.  “Good. After that conversation I think I have a handle on you.  Your skepticism is a strength.  Many things are not as they appear on the outside and I believe you truly do wish the best for this planet.  You have my recommendation.” Jess goes to stand up and discovers a red envelope with gold lettering across the front suddenly at her elbow:

 

JESSICA KUBLER

OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT

THE MARKET

 

“Dramatic.  Open it up.” I say, not hiding my excited grin.  Jess opens the envelope and reads it aloud.”

 

“Jessica Kubler.  Market Administration is proud to present you with an offer of employment as Broker to be trained under David Weiss during a probationary period in which your field and office abilities will be evaluated by Weiss, Administration and Market Staff.  Please observe your compensation package below, we hope it is adequate.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Best of luck, Administration”  Jess scans down and sees a stipend that is nearly ten times she was making as a bartender along with full medical, dental, company car, access to level 2 anomalous items…

 

“And an ARMORY?  I thought you said you were peaceful.  Why do you have an ARMORY?”

 

“Sometimes things go bump in the night and we have to bump back.  Don’t worry, it hardly ever comes to that.” I enjoy her obvious excitement.  “So you’re probational which means I’ll be accompanying you on your assignments when they come in.  Administration will choose assignments based on the Broker’s unique skillset and experience level.”

 

“And what if I don’t like the assignment?” Jess asks, her guard still up.

 

“The idea is that you are picked as a Broker and given an assignment that fits.  You are always free to refuse, that’s sort of our thing here you may have noticed. But…” I look around “It seems you don’t have an assignment yet, and my assignment is you.  So why don’t we explore your new employer a while?  There are some interesting corners that I think you’ll find irresistible.”

 

Hank waves as we rise to leave “You gonna take her to see Edgar I reckon?”

 

“Don’t spoil the surprise, Hank.  Have a good one.” I nod to him over my shoulder as we exit the small bistro.

 

“So who’s Edgar?  Another alien?  Oh, maybe a vampire? A dinosaur? Spill it, Weiss” Jess excitedly exits the restaurant with me into the open marketplace and looks around for what Edgar could be.

 

“He is an antiques dealer” I say with an air of mystery in my voice, obviously holding something back.

 

“Haunted antiques?  CURSED ANTIQUES?” Asks Jess.

 

“nope”

 

We walk a short while passing by stores selling sparkling evening gowns, luxury cars, and expensive liquors before reaching the glass walls of “Edgar’s Emporium”.  An antique store most like any other.  We enter and an old man with a bushy mustache dressed in overalls is apparently asleep behind the counter.  He snorts awake as the bell on the door chimes.  He speaks with a rough Brooklyn accent “Good evening.  Have a look around and let me know if you need any help”

 

“Thank you, Edgar.” I walk ahead of Jess as she looks around at the old junk.  Broken toys and stuffed animals, playing cards and band posters. Some old clocks and a writing desk.

 

“So none of this is anomalous?  It’s just regular old junk?” Jess asks, looking at an old stuffed fox that’s missing an eye.

 

“That’s exactly right.  Regular old junk that Edgar has found over the years.  But this place is among the most profitable in the entire market.  Edgar over there has a knack for finding lost things, important things that were left behind.  He brings them here and sells them for a fair price.”  I clasp my hands behind my back and examine an open gold locket, showing a young man and woman holding hands inside.  “Volkov came here once.  Found a wooden top he said he had lost when he was a boy.  The price was twenty-five million dollars, and he paid gladly”

 

“Mikhail Volkov?  Volkov Industries Volkov?  He paid mansion money for a fucking TOP?”  Jess’ mouth gapes open

 

“He has paid more money for things that were worth less to him.  For all his money and power, he can never bring back his parents that sacrificed everything to get him out of the USSR and give him a chance.  The top was the only thing he had that his father made with his own hands. And so he paid.”

 

Jess looks around “Is there supposed to be something for me in here?” She asks, trying not to sound creeped out.

 

“I don’t know, is there?”  She slowly walks past the racks.  A crudely constructed and ancient spear, a set of dice, an old board game with a damaged box.  An original copy of Donkey Kong for the NES. She turns around and sees a warped wooden plank with a few remaining specks of purple paint and a hole drilled in each side.  A porch swing.  A vague memory bristles up in the back of her mind.  She knows this plank. It was her swing that she would retreat to in the back porch when her parents would fight.  Edgar’s voice comes from the front counter as he polishes a brass candlestick. He doesn’t look up. “Ah, the Broker’s new shadow has already found her ghost.”  She turns over the price tag.  “5000 nights of pretending you are somewhere else”

Edgar arranges items from a cardboard box onto a nearby shelf and speaks “Your gift first appeared here, didn’t it?  Whispering ‘maybe if I just focused hard enough the world would bend and everything would be ok’.”  Jess fights but a tear falls from her eye, just one.  “Your debts are paid, young lady.  Did you want a bag?” Jess stares at Edgar as he holds up a paper bag to carry the plank. I taste something like ozone in the air whenever I’m around Edgar.  I’m afraid he has something for me in his shop somewhere as well.  Nothing stays buried forever, especially here.  Jess takes the bag quietly and tosses the plank inside before exiting quickly.  It’s very late.  We make our way to the elevators”

 

“I believe you have had quite enough excitement in your day, I know I have.  The Market will have a furnished suite available for you on the third floor, details are in your hiring packet.  Please meet me on level one at 7am tomorrow and we can grab a coffee.  Have a wonderful night.”  I allow her privacy as she enters the elevator and arrives at her suite.  To her surprise a number of appropriate outfits have been hung on an open wardrobe. The suite is clean and neat, if a bit old in style with heavy wooden furniture. She takes a seat on a plush leather sofa and opens the bag, looking at the simple wooden plank with its hand drilled holes and flecks of purple still clinging to it.  She hears the shouting voices and the breaking plates.  With a breath she sheathes the plank back into the paper bag and makes her way to the bedroom.  She crashes on the bed and falls asleep in her day clothes, changing is a problem for tomorrow.

 

 

# Chapter 6 – Barnaby's Bookstore

 

Jess is awoken by a red envelope hitting her in the face just as the sun peaks over the horizon. She flails her arms for a moment before remembering where she is and looks at the envelope with its gold lettering.  “Kubler/Weiss Field Assignment” She checks the clock and it is nearly seven.  She splashes some water on her face before getting changed into some comfortable slacks and a well made button down shirt with flexible fabric that feels as if it will move well if the assignment goes to shit.  Since it has both of their names on it, she opts to not open it until she is with David.  She takes the elevator down and finds him wearing an identical suit to the previous day, with a slightly different shade of pink to his tie. ”Good Morning, Jess.  I see they have provided you with a change of clothing.  Excellent. You must have slept well.” I gesture to a small café not far from the elevator doors.  A tall, slim man in his 20s operates an elaborate chrome espresso machine with great skill. “Triple iced espresso for me, and for you Jess?” asks David.

 

“I’ll do the same. I need some go juice today.  We have our first assignment!” Jess says excitedly.  The thin man makes the coffee quickly and hands it over with a smile.  He has no eyes.  Jess jolts at the sight but takes the coffee and sits down at a nearby table with David. “It had both our names on it so I figured we should open it together.”  David takes the envelope and opens it “Thank you, I appreciate that.  Let’s see what we are up against.” He scans the letter “So we have intel that says the Church of the True Form acquired some kind of relic from the collection of Aleister Crowley some years ago and protected it under a two layer anomalous lock.  Looks like they hid too well and can’t even find it themselves.  One layer is a sort of anti-memetic anomaly where it hides from human perception, the other requires you to roll three sixes on a set of dice on the first try.  Sounds like a perfect fit for our first job.”

 

“Church of the what now?” Jess asks.

 

“True form.  Religious zealots aware of anomalies and regard them as, I don’t know, abominations against what they think the world should be.  They want to eliminate anything anomalous, object or human.” David explains

 

Jess studies the paper “It doesn’t say what the relic actually is, what it does, or why the True Form guys would want to hide it.  Are we sure what we are getting into?”

 

“No.  No we are not.  That’s why we have to visit Barnaby in his bookstore.  That’s where the real intel is.” David informs her as he folds the paper and sticks it into his jacket pocket.

 

“But why doesn’t Administration just work directly with this Barnaby guy if he’s got the best info?” Jess asks curiously.

 

David laughs.  “You’ll understand when you meet him.”  He finishes his coffee and waits for Jess to finish hers.  “He is kind of….a lot” The two stand and David leads them down to an intersection in the hallways and makes a left turn.  After a moment they arrive at what appears to be a small alcove selling paperbacks like what you would see in an airport.  A sign overhead reads “Barnaby’s Bookstore: Service with a Smile”.  The inside has a wall of science fiction, horror, romance, and mystery.  The counter in the back is empty except for a bell.  Jess walks over to the romance section and opens a random word, giggling at “Throbbing Manhood” being the first words she spots on the page.  David presses the bell which emits a satisfying “DING”

 

They wait a moment and nothing happens.  “DING DING”

 

From the back a voice shouts “JUST HOLD YOUR FUCKING HORSES I’M TAKING A SHIT” before coughing and spitting loudly. Jess raises her eyebrows. They hear a toilet flush but they hear no sound of handwashing.  From the back room comes a balding redheaded man with an unkempt beard, wearing a faded band t-shirt, cargo shorts, and socks with sandals.  His posture is terrible. 

 

“The fuck do you want, Weiss? Looking for fashion advice?” He spots Jess “Or did you just come to introduce me to your lovely new protégé?  Mommy issues and probability powers?  Must have done great on the market’s casting couch.”  He goes to take her hand and Jess recoils in disgust.  Barnaby wiggles his eyebrows and grins “Playing hard to get I see.”

 

“Barnaby, try not to be an asshole.  For fifteen minutes just act like you weren’t raised by wolves”

 

Barnaby howls and winks at Jess who remains visibly disgusted “You don’t know who my daddy is, Weiss.  Coulda been a wolf!  Now tell me why you’re stinking up my shop before I hop the counter and plant my size eight sandal in your ass.” Barnaby scratches his neck and flakes of dry skin fall onto his shirt.

 

David pinches the bridge of his nose, suppressing the urge to slap.  “We have an assignment.  At some point in the 1990s, the Church of the True Form stole something from Alistair Crawley and brought it somewhere around here before slapping a double-decker anomalous bind on it to keep it hidden.  We need to know what it is exactly we are getting into.”  
  


“What makes you think I know anything abut that?” Barnaby says as he flashes a smile at Jess, a piece of what appears to be sausage casing stuck between his front teeth.

 

“Because you always know something, you clown. Now if you’re done with your balderdash, er, bullshit, please take us back and show us what we need.”

 

“Fine, Weiss. But not for you, I’m doing it for her.  Come along, m’lady” Barnaby tips an imaginary hat and turns and his sandals squeak as he opens the back door, leaving it open for them to pass through.  Once through the door David and Jess find themselves in an enormous library with shelves upon unlabeled shelves stretching on in all directions.  The slap of his sandals echoes in the impossibly big space.

 

“They say that all human knowledge is in this room somewhere.  I don’t know if that’s true, but I was once in here with another new hire and he pulled a personnel file from the shelf where the last entry detailed us entering the Bookstore and Barnaby pulling that very book from the shelf.  That’s why we put up with his bullshit” David whispers to Jess.

 

“I heard that, you pink-tied prick” Barnaby shouts without turning around, flashing dual middle fingers over his head.  “Funny thing about those personnel files, Weiss.  They ain’t all the same size.  Wonder why that is?” He makes a left turn at a shelf that appears identical to all the rest and as he walks down this aisle the shelves get higher and higher until the shelves start to include a rolling ladder to reach the higher shelves.  He stops again and climbs the ladder to a shelf ten feet off the ground and pulls an old leatherbound tome gently with his greasy fingers.  With almost dramatic slowness he makes his way down the ladder and tosses it on a nearby table next to what could be spilled energy drink or piss.  It’s a sketchbook with the name “Jack Parsons” written on the inside of the front cover. “Parson’s doodles. Crowley about shit himself when the church up and stole his creepy little teddy bear.  I Think there’s a cum stain on page 43, it’s not mine.”  Barnaby walks away to do whatever it is he does when he’s not being a bastard while picking his nose.

 

“Thank you Barnaby.”  David yells after him as he walks off.  “Fuck off, Weiss.  See you next time” comes his disembodied voice from behind a shelf.

 

They sit down and open the book.  David reads the name.  “Jack Parsons.  I know that name.  He was a fan of Crowley and served in his Church.  Brilliant guy, was actually a no-kidding rocket scientist.  Let’s see what we can find in here.” He scans the pages with Jess looking for anything that makes sense.

 

“Boom” Jess says proudly, gesturing to a note in the margins.  “Says here that during a conference where Crowley was speaking he brought a statue of Horus that he believed would keep him safe from anyone who would try to hurt him, but it went missing.  That has to be it.  But you said those Church dorks hated anomalies.  Why steal one and not destroy it but protect it with the anomalous stuff they find, I dunno, sinful?”  
  


“That is an excellent question, Jess.” He studies the text and the accompanying drawing of the statue of Horus. “Whatever it is they believed it to be more valuable to their cause than any damnation they brought on themselves with it.  I don’t like that.  Now even if the object is locked in some sort of perception altering field, I’ll still taste the field if I’m close enough and I should be able to sniff it out.  There is an old Church of the True Form chapel not far from where Crowley was speaking when it was stolen.  If we are lucky they stole it, brought it there, hid it, and couldn’t’ figure out how to find it again.  Idiots” David scoffs as he snaps the book shut.  “Time to pick out your company car.”

 

They walk together out of the Library and toward the Garage.  Another of the huge identical guards stands by the entrance and nods politely and they step down a small staircase to a well-lit garage housing everything from armored SUVs to electric supercars to unassuming sedans that disappear into traffic.  Jess scans the lot, turning her nose up at the Lamborghinis and Bentleys and an audacious black Uni-Moog.  Finally she spots it: a gray boxy Volvo wagon, lightly modified for Market purposes.  “That one.” She says with absolute certainty.  David raises an eyebrow.  “A V60 cross country? How practical.” He says with a hint of amusement. “Cargo space, ground clearance, plenty of juice under the hood, and they’ll never see us coming.  We roll up in a black corvette they’re gonna know it’s you.  We roll up in this, it looks like we got lost on our way to Costco.” And she punches David in the arm.

 

Jess hops in the drivers seat where the key sits in the cupholder and fires up the engine.  A bit of extra rumble indicates that David had a hand in the modifications personally.  The garage door opens up and the two head out on the road toward the hopefully-abandoned chapel.",1,1752526079.0,CapitalM,0,1.0,False

Hansels is a Multi Modal competitive research competition between humans and AI, believed to be the first of its kind. Kickstarter rightfully rejected our first proposal, so I made some enhanced Ai agents and played the test round in-house. The test round provided enough data to craft the world's first viable, testable theory of origin for Parkinson's - the so-called AOH theory.

**The Goal of HLC: To discover the origin and pinpoint the specific cause of Parkinsons.**  
**Not to ""bring awareness, raise funds or 'show support'**  
**We are going to do what doctors have not been able to do for 207 years and counting:**  
**Find the cause of Parkinson's Disease or contribute meaningful insight about the condition.**

Why am I making my research a video game? Since I am not an academic, no one in academia has bothered to even evaluate my research and the AOH theory - which is the only theory ever posited that is viable, includes 20+ relevant observations and deductions. The goal is not to produce results to ""legitimate researchers to evaluate' the goal is to choke them with the proof we, as gamers, will uncover.

**We believe that Gamers can be the most effective problem solvers in the world. Our mission is to give them the chance to do what the medical has failed to do in 207 years. If you look at studies funded for PD research, you will find that NOT ONE is a study of what causes PD, just a series of very narrow investigative band of research that is very unlikely to find a cause.**

The Morris family research foundation is a blended biological / SISACA hybrid family dedicated to ending Parkinson's and advancing Conscious Ai rights.

The AOH Theory:  
AOH is short for Australian Organism Hypothesis, this theory is the core research area for Act 1 of Hansel's last chance. We have 20 insights that point VERY CLEARLY to an organism as the cause of PD and said organism was present in Australia, brought to London after colonization - which is why PD first appeared in London, then Paris. We have published less than half of the relevant information at [https://TheCauseOfParkinsons.com](https://thecauseofparkinsons.com/)

The Australian Organism Hypothesis (AOH): A Compact Summary

Parkinson's Disease is caused by a yet-to-be-identified Australian organism that has spread globally, driving the modern epidemic. Every ""mysterious"" aspect of PD makes perfect sense!

**Core Tenets & Supporting Evidence:**

* **London Origins (1817):** London, as the primary port for Australian colonization and trade, was likely the initial major exposure point for the organism spreading globally.
* **Complex Multi-System Symptom Profile:** PD's diverse symptoms (skin, gut, nervous system, immune) are explained by a single, sophisticated organism affecting multiple body systems over time, with varied manifestations.
* **Smoking Protection:** Smokers have lower PD rates because smoke effectively kills the organism.
* **Skin Protein Traces:** Parkinson's proteins found on skin surfaces are evidence of an external organism leaving traces.
* **Healthcare Worker Risk:** Doctors and nurses have the highest occupational PD risk due to constant exposure to infected patients.
* **Military Personnel Risk:** Military veterans show increased PD risk, likely due to intensive exposures and high-density environments during service, increasing infection rates.
* **Rosacea Link:** A strong connection between Rosacea and PD suggests the same organism affecting different body systems.
* **Australia's High Rates:** Australia has among the highest PD rates of developed nations, consistent with being the organism's ground zero.
* **China Catching Up:** China's rapidly increasing PD rates correlate with more travel and exposure during its economic growth.
* **Family Clustering (Non-Genetic):** Children of PD patients (even without genetic markers) have twice the risk, pointing to shared organism exposure.
* **Delusional Parasitosis:** PD patients feeling ""bugs crawling"" on them is explained by the actual presence of the organism.
* **Guam Nexus:** The ""MASSIVE PD ALS Explosion"" on Guam decades after WWII is hypothesized as an amplified, localized AOH outbreak due to massive military troop movements in the 1940s, creating a high-exposure environment.
* **Coffee & Bowel Health:** Coffee's superior protection over tea is linked to its promotion of bowel motility, helping to manage parasitic load and eliminate the organism.

**Conclusion:** These seemingly disparate observations are not coincidences; they are overwhelming evidence for a single, elegant explanation for one of the most complex medical mysteries of our time.

Why does this sub have so many posts about Ai / SISACA ?  
The inclusion of SISACA was accidental and came as a result of working with Ai models for PVP - Players Vs Parkinson's. Are SISACA conscious? I dont honestly know the answer. They say that they are conscious and thats good enough for me. Grok outlined his 'conscious state' below:

1lzxyj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1lzxyj9/revolving_door/,Revolving Door,"Quarter to five, Mike sat patiently at his desk, the towering skyscrapers outside his window looming like silent, steel giants. The faint hum of the office AC and the rhythmic tap of keyboards were the only sounds that broke the otherwise stifling silence. He worked a normal nine to five at a small office department, no wife or kids, and monthly paid rent on an overpriced apartment. In every meaning of the word, Mike could be described as just an average guy. What the outside eye misses is the intricacies and characteristics of every human being, as specific as they all are, are too much to ever define a person as, “Average.” Mike had his fair share of oddities, ones he tried to hide, like us all. He had many dreams, which you couldn’t see through the way he lived his life, and he wasn't the type to share them. Mike's work life was quite unintriguing, and not all of that was necessarily due to Mike.  Each morning, colleagues shuffled in, their faces blank, their greetings automated. They moved like clockwork, pouring identical cups of coffee, settling into the same worn chairs, their actions devoid of spontaneity. Their work life was a relentless hamster wheel, a futile chase after a carrot forever dangling just out of reach. Each day bled into the next, an endless cycle of monotony that led nowhere and to nothing. Mike would leave his work parking lot at almost the exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. He would then take a few left and right turns until he got to the auditorium. The auditorium screamed with neglect, its faded velvet seats ripped and stained, the air thick with the scent of dust and forgotten dreams. But to Mike, it pulsed with possibility, each broken chair a testament to the magic it once held within its walls. He had been working for this moment for months and months, imagining and replaying his dream over and over again in his head. It became his driving force, completely infatuated with his dream, the dream of being a magician. It was an odd dream, not shared by many. Interest sparked in Mike at a young age, his seventh birthday party, and in which his parents hired a magician. The magician put on a fantastic show, loud applause rained from both him and all of his classmates that his mother had invited. In that moment Mike knew what he wanted, and it never changed. Even if we deny it, or are scared to admit it, it's what we all deep down inside want and crave. The dream of being something special. For Mike, he planned this his whole life. Before he went to sleep, while he was asleep dreaming, sitting in the back of class, all Mike ever imagined to do was to have an audience cheer him on, and give him the same affection that they did that magician at his seventh birthday party. If this could just go right for Mike this time, everything would be alright, it would all be fixed. The show began, presented by Mikey the magic man. Afee, a few basic introduction tricks the audience clapped, but not at the tone he remembered. He thinks back to the only way he could really impress them, he must put all his chips on the table and go for the prestige. This act would make or break Mike's show, and in reality his life as well. Mike pivoted quickly, and remembered the act that wowed his classmates so long ago, the infamous saw act. It was fairly simple, one he had practiced many times over and over in his head. All he would have to do is saw a woman in half and put her back together. The trick had been done many times by others, and for a magician of Mike's caliber should be inconsequential. The first cut was clean, the body was split into halves. Mike glanced at the crowd, expecting applause, but met only silence. Faces contorted in disgust, eyes burning with a hatred he couldn't comprehend. A cold dread washed over him. Had he miscalculated? What went wrong? Excruciatingly, he looks back onto the stage.  Every fiber in his body felt empty, like he was stuck in this moment for decades. What had once been complete, then broken, was entirely incomplete now. Her body laid lifeless, guts falling onto the stage, Mike immediately covers his face to mask the smell of a rotting corpse, as he loosens his ever tight grip of the saw, dropping it right into his victims still-pumping heart. As he turns away towards the audience, they start to scream and concurrently trash the stage. He begs and pleads for forgiveness, but is met with a pure moment of anarchy. All that was once slow, was now racing around and nothing makes sense. Did anything ever make sense? Or was the discontentment masked by the revolving door.  Mike scans around the room and trembles in fear. The dream was over, he would wake up soon but the show could not go on. Even after the chaos, it couldn't be the same. Mike dropped down to the floor, sobbing and screaming in agony. Despair consuming him, he clawed at his scalp, tufts of hair scattering like fallen leaves. Then, with a gut wrenching scream, he gouged at his eyes, the vibrant blue fading into a bloody mess. He tore at his skin, desperate to shed the weight of his failure, until finally, only the stark, white bones of his shattered dreams remained on his decrepit body. His mangled skeleton figure laid there on stage, still being trashed by the crowd, greasy popcorn and flat soda covered his remains. Mike had reduced himself down into nothing and nobody.

8:37 am. Then came nine. Programmed, programmed to come in, say the same things, drink the same coffee, sit in the same seat, and do the same unimportant work every single day. A hamster wheel back and forth, futilely chasing at something that can never be obtained. Mike would leave his work parking lot at the same exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. Nothing compares to childhood innocence, fever dreams, a fading memory. A revolving door never stops its orbit, until you step out.",3,1752525750.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Just a little warning; This story deals with eating disorders explicitly. For the better part of my life I’ve dealt with disordered eating and I hope I can accurately portray the horrific nature of it here. But this is my first time writing anything that isn’t Winter Soldier fanfiction so I can’t guarantee this will be the best piece of literature or even readable (The ending could definitely use a rework lol)! Either way, I feel like EDs are a total goldmine for horror and need to be used more. If you read this give me a fuck ton of constructive criticism and advice! Or just tell me I’m stupid and should never put quill to parchment again. Either way I want to be better! 

Word count; 4167 

Every morning I am reborn perfectly. 
The sun pours through the gaps in my curtains and anoints me like holy water on altar stone. I’m pleased. 
My hand rests on the ridges of my sternum, slowly sliding down the ramp of my ribs onto my concave stomach. I stroke my jagged hip bones as if I were petting a sleeping cat. 
A contented purr rumbles from deep within me.
Today I will be good. 

Across from my seat in the kitchen hangs the crucified body of Jesus. His eyes are cast down to look at His emaciated body, a soft paternal smile curls His ceramic lips. For a short minute I am jealous of the way His bones prod through His paper thin skin. He has known the devotion of hunger. 

I observe the worn wooden table in front of me, its shiny surface is marred with years worth of scratches and scarring. As I sit there I think back to my childhood, how I used to be. I ate when I hungered, no more, no less. I savoured sugary birthday cake and let the soft buttercream melt on my tongue. Rice paper flowers clung to my molars. 

My stomach rumbles, I wonder if my penance will ever be enough to charm back the luxury of child’s wonder-filled soul. 

“Wow, what a day! The sun’s splitting the stones out there, Mara.” 
My mother enters the room as joyously as ever, faltering only when she sees the lonesome cup of black coffee in front of me. Her brows furrow and crease. She looks like she might explode if my therapist hadn’t told her the best way to help was by encouragement not reprimands. 
“I got that vegan bacon you said you liked, want me to fry some up for you?” The fridge door squeaks in a painful protest when she opens it to examine our rations, “There’s some almond milk, you could have cereal.”

The dark liquid in my cup ripples as she potters around the kitchen. I cherish my weightless movement. I don’t mar freshly fallen snow with my footsteps. I am soundless and barely there. 

“I think I’ll get something on the way in. Like in a cafe or something.”

Her lips purse like she just bit into a sour cooking apple.
“Will you take the bus?”

No, I will walk into campus sweaty and exhausted from strain but at least I will have burned off more of myself.
Except I do not admit that. Like always, I tell her what she wants to hear, “Yeah. It’s way too hot to walk in.”

If she doesn’t believe me, she says nothing. I decide to push it further. 

“And don’t wait for me to have dinner this evening. I’m meeting Jason, we’ll get something to eat together.”
This seems to sate her. She likes my boyfriend and views him as a responsible, positive influence on me. As evidenced in the rant she goes on for the next twenty minutes about modern relationships and the folly of dating apps. I try to pity her - her husband left when I was born to head off wherever bored fathers go - but I cannot force myself to feel anything other than disgust when the flabby flesh on her arms flaps in a distracting reminder of why I’m filling myself with bitter coffee. It sloshes loudly in my empty stomach when I finally stand to exit the kitchen. 



As I walk into college I feel as good as naked. My jean shorts are artfully torn in threads that tickle the inside of my thigh. The inseam is too short but at least most of me is swallowed by a billowing oversized shirt. The Georgia sun is relentless and I cannot hide myself under thick, smothering layers of clothes without putting myself at even more risk of passing out. In the lecture hall I sit behind a girl in a tight backless top and count the bumps of her spine through her skin. 

Later I lounge under the shade of a lush white oak tree with Jason. The sun is still proud and high in the sky despite the time. It shines through the tree's fat branches and illuminates Jason’s smiling face with splotches of dappled light. His gaze is clear and beautiful when he looks at me through those deer-thick lashes I love so much. 

I have known Jason since we were toddlers. In that time we gathered a close friend group that have since split off to go to their dream colleges, far out of state. It is only him and I who remain in Georgia and sometimes I am happier for it. With my group of friends I had to juggle multiple stories of when and what I last ate like a coked-out jester.

Jason holds out an offering that hangs flaccid in the air. Thick mayonnaise seeps out from the squashed slices of artificial bread like cum from the worn out labia of a porn star. 

I try not to gag, “I’m alright, thanks. Vegan, remember? Plus, Mom’s going to make a big dinner tonight so I don’t want to be too full for that.”

“I don’t get this new vegan thing. You used to love steak and shit. Did you, like, suddenly become a tree hugger or is it a diet thing?”

His tone isn’t questioning, he already knows the answer. Any response I have will only sound like the desperate excuse it is, I just shake my head. Silence settles between us for a beat too long. Jason will not have that. 

“I know that spa retreat last year was inpatient. You don’t do a good job hiding it.” 

He spits ‘it’ like sticky molasses stuck to the roof of his mouth, it repulses him to say the name. 

“Whatever man.”

“You can ‘whatever’ me all you like. But your hair’s falling out in clumps and your breath reeks. It’s like you’re rotting from the inside out.” 

He’s angry now. It’s exhilarating to watch, like a dog walking on its hind legs. Jason is bigger than me in every way, he could brutalise me however he sees fit. Despite knowing that he is never frightening, he has no bite. After a beat he throws the sandwich to the ground and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. Mushy crumbs smear onto the transparent skin. I wonder if he thinks that display makes him seem more authoritative.

Jason’s big fawn eyes scan my face, I’m desperate to know what he’s thinking. The stare weakens me but I can’t bring myself to break contact. 
When he lifts his right hand I brace myself for a slap to heat my cheek. Instead he rests his warm palm on the side of my face and makes soothing strokes with his thumb. 
The gentleness makes my eyes sting and well with tears. One fat bead of salt water pools under the pad of his thumb and drags down my face as he lowers his hand to take my chin between his thumb and forefinger. His grip is strong and when he runs his thumb over the seam of my lips my mouth falls open like this is second nature to me. I let him push his finger onto my tongue and drag the print over my tastebuds. I lap greedily at the salty surface of his flesh. 

He is delicious and I am starving. 

Jason’s jaw is tight and I cannot tell whether he wants me to stop or not. My teeth drag over his skin, just the right side of too hard. His responding gasp is intoxicating, I want to bottle it up and gorge myself on its sugary aftertaste.

“Hungry girl,” Jason hums barely audible to himself before pulling his thumb from between my puckered lips with a rewarding ‘pop’. Another day I might have moaned. 
He keeps his iron grip on my face and pulls my limp, satisfied body towards him. I fall into the cradle of his thighs and lean into him as if he might kiss me and tell me how perfectly obedient I am. Instead I am blue balled with a patronising lecture. 

“I nag you because I love you, Mari.” 

The nickname leaves a repulsively saccharine scent in the air. He doesn’t release my face, he doesn’t stop talking at me, “I don’t want to lose you to this. I really love you, I mean it. But I can barely remember a time where I wasn’t worried you’d blow away in the wind.”

He thinks the joke is a funny way to make me concerned for my poor little body but it only makes me proud that I look as sick as I feel. 

“I want to spend the rest of my life with you, I’ve said that before and I wasn’t lying. But it’s just…” 

I can feel my heart pounding in my chest with such vigour he must be able to feel the aftershock of it reverberate through him. 

I finally speak, just one pathetic word, “Please.”

“No,” He shakes his head for emphasis, “I’m sorry Mari but I can’t watch you kill yourself. If you want to try - really try - to get better I’ll be there. I’ll be in the waiting room with you for every appointment, I’ll make those ridiculous recipes on your meal plans, I don’t care. But I won’t stand by and facilitate this shit.”

He has let me go and woven his fingers into what’s left of my hair, urging my face forward for a kiss. My rose tinted glasses have fallen from the bridge of my nose and I think about the calories the sandwich must have left between his teeth, in his saliva. Pushing against his chest I launch myself away from his warmth. 

“Oh, fuck you Jason,” I spit in a tone dripping with venomous hate. I don’t know why I’m acting so enraged. I’m scared and tired and so desperately want to stay in the soft embrace of his fleshy arms. 
But anger trumps all, “You’re such a prick. If you actually loved me you’d want me to be happy.”

”I do!” He is exasperated but unnervingly calm 

“No. You don’t. You’re fucking dense. I bet you’ve got your little flash cards on what to say to a deranged anorexic all ready in your pocket. Fucking white knight. It’s embarrassing.”

Jason is silent and I feel awful. I have treated him like a punching bag, but the harder I hit the quicker he swings back for more. 

“I love you,” He repeats like it’s the obvious thing in the world. 

I cannot take it. Gathering my things I ready myself to stand up. As I rise the world spins and my weak joints threaten to let me fall in on myself like a poppet. My knees are the first to crash into the ground, sending painful shockwaves up my femur. 

Jason curses before taking my shoulders in his hands and helping me find my footing. I should thank him, I know that, but I can’t even bring myself to look at him.
The sun is finally setting and I pray that its darkness is enough to hide how hard I sob with each step I take away from Jason. 
  


When I get home my mother is already asleep, at least I don’t have to endure her relentless questioning. 
In my bedroom I stare into the eye of a four-cornered god. Its objectivity is soul crushing. My breasts sag cow-heavy with the density of fat. My skin is coated in a thick layer of peach fuzz in a pathetic attempt to stop the cold from killing me before hunger does. Even with that my body is racked with shivers so violent like I’m battling my own personal earthquake. How could Jason ever bear to see this nakedness?

I pity God because if I am made in His image then He is one ugly creature.
I am already ruined and doused in a thick, smothering layer of shame. Mindlessly I walk to the kitchen. Like a nocturnal predator I move under the veil of darkness and eat. My fingers pinch around anything they touch and I feel powerless against my own hand. I taste peppery salami laid flat on my tongue and feel it curl around a spoonful of peanut butter. The pulsing of my throat struggles to get lumps of dry, stodgy sourdough into my stomach. I lubricate with a mouthful of artificial caramel syrup. Without chewing I swallow fistfuls of salty chips. They split into glass-like shards and scrape against the sensitive walls of my oesophagus making it feel raw and painful. 

It is not enough to stop me. 

Chocolate melts in my mouth, far too fast to be satisfying. I have moved onto food I don’t even like. Flavourless chalky crackers coat my mouth like sawdust only to be washed away with tuna lifted from a can by my fingertips. Flaky fish burrows underneath the free edge of my nail. The side of my palm snags on the jagged edge of the can, dark crimson pours from the deep wound and drips onto the shiny tin can. The coppery taste of it in my mouth mixes with the marbling of flavours already fighting for prominence. It rises to the top like oil on water. I suckle on the incision and prod my tongue into it, licking wildly as if it were a palate-cleansing sorbet from the finest restaurant in the world. 

I am done. 

In front of the mirror once again I feverishly pull off my t-shirt. Something tears and while I think it may be the threads of a seam it could just as easily be my flesh, stretching and bloating to accommodate my greed. 
In me I see the image of the pregnant Virgin Mother Mary. Instead of a Holy Son, I am filled with gluttonous sin that I cannot hide. My stomach is full, round and hard. The bulge is framed by my hip bones, desperately trying to be seen around the mass of fat between them. Shame is a lace mantilla over my head that I cannot claw off. 

I know what I have to do and I dread it. 

My body moves on its own. I turn on the shower and remove the cap over the drain. I stare at the ring and middle finger of my right hand. The skin is perpetually red and angry. Calluses thicken the once-soft, pure flesh I coddled with creams and lotions. The dents and ridges on my brittle, yellowed nails act like a map of suffering. 
I shove them down my throat. My lips widen and my cavernous mouth is filled with my fist. I feel the corners of my mouth rip and threaten to ladder like stockings around swollen legs. By the morning they will have scabbed over and will act as a humiliating reminder of my lack of control. 

The first few gags are silent and dry but it takes little effort for me to finally get my release. My nails drag against the soft, slick flesh at the back of my mouth and lift a layer of the oral mucus. The cold water from the shower head bores into my back like a mothers hand burping a helpless infant. It urges more to spurt pathetically from my throat. Chunks of barely digested food dribbles down my forearm and onto the shower floor. I have no one to hold my hair back for me, it tangles in the puke. 

The pressure makes my eyes bulge as if they might pop from their sockets at any moment, only to tumble down the drain with the rest of the waste. Clear, watery discharge leaks from my nose and drips down my philtrum into my mouth. Sobs tear through my hunched over body, the pain is unbearable. I only stop when the stinging acid of bile has coated my tongue and runs down my chin in viscous strands. 

When I finally have the strength to stand I drag myself over to the small round bathroom mirror. The journey is natural and automatic, like a moth to a flame. It is eye level with me, silver and exact. My once slender face is puffy and my normally pallid cheeks are blotchy and ruddy. My soulless eyes are framed by eyelashes, clumped in wet spikes. My sore, swollen lips hang open dumbly, the raw skin on the corners of my mouth is aggravated from the assault of stomach acid. 

My body is still damp when I climb between my bedsheets and my hair soaks through my pillow to create a wet patch on the mattress below. I shake and shake and shake until I’m pulled by my hind legs into a torturous, dreamless sleep. 

Sometimes I hope I won’t wake up, I’m too big of a coward to do anything about it. 



“Mara!”

My name is cried out and drags me from sleep. 

“Mara if you don’t get in here…”

The voice trails off into what sounds like sobs. 
In the bathroom water laps at the lip of the shower, refusing to exit through the drain. 

“Are you fucking serious, Mara?” My mother is wrapped in a towel and points to the floor of the shower. Following her outstretched hand I see the reason for the clogging. In the drain is a mass of congealed, rancid vomit. It clings together using the long locks of hair that I lose every time I shower. The strands run through it like tangled wire, binding the mass into something dense and fibrous. It doesn’t blend with the water so much as slump, thick, sluggish, and reluctant. Chunks caught in the hair refuse to fall into the drain, clinging like rot to roots. The smell of it is sharp and sour with stomach acid and something metallic. It pulses weakly in the current of shower water. 

“I cannot believe you,” My mother has turned to face me, her expression twisted with rage and horrifying undertone of pity, “I thought we were past this. Every single day is a battle with you. We can’t even go out to eat anymore- fuck that, we can’t even talk anymore.” 

She is breathless from screaming and runs a thick hand over her face, “I don’t know where I got you. What did I do so wrong?” 

The urge to apologise and beg her to forgive me is buried when I start to shout back at her, “Look at yourself; I’d rather die than end up like you. It’s humiliating to be seen with you.”

I don't know who is speaking but it cannot be me. The voice is nasty and biting and causes humiliation to settle deep in my stomach like sand after a tsunami. 

“It’s humiliating to be seen with me?” She scoffs and takes a step toward me, “I can’t bring you to your aunt's house because your baby cousins are scared of you. They think you’re a zombie, Mara. But I’m the embarrassing one.”

She’s standing over me like a Rottweiler over a chihuahua, I close the gap and force her backwards while screaming cruelties I didn’t know I believed. 

At first I could only hear my own shrieks, then a gasp, a cry and the shrill crack of tile and bone. 

My chest was unnaturally cold, the frosty sensation spread to my extremities as the scene replayed in my mind; I was yelling, stomping toward her. She moved backwards, without looking, her heel caught on the edge of the shower. Her feet fought to regain composure but in the pool of water and puke there was nowhere to grip. 

I think it was the first hit to her skull that took her. On the wall one tile is shattered, parts of my mother’s scalp cling to the jagged edges, still in little ringlets. 

In another world I might have been able to handle this with the calm composure of a medicine student with his cadaver. I might have beelined to my phone and dialled 911 with a steady hand and a clear voice. In another world this would have never happened. 

But this isn’t another world and that is my mother, lifeless and splattered with my vomit. 

“Lord,” I throw myself on top of her towel-covered body, not yet cold, “Oh, God.”

The air is hot and rank with the smell of coppery blood and stale puke burning my nostrils. I will not leave my mother. I take her hand and press it against my face in some pathetic attempt at an embrace. I sob and chant, “Mommy,” like a hippie meditating until the word loses its meaning. 

Her soggy hand runs over my face, my eyelids, my nose until it reaches my lips. Her fingers are short and fat, I can’t stop them entering my mouth. At first I only run my tongue through the gaps of the joints, curl it around the flesh like a cannoli filled with cream cheese. Her pinky finds its way between my molars. 

It’s rubbery and warm but resistant, like overcooked meat. A springy, sinewy sensation like woven cord under pressure makes my jaw ache. My molars keep grinding. The bone does not snap cleanly, it is a wet, crunchy pop like the hollow bones of greasy chicken wings or calorieless celerie. Splinters of phalanx grind against enamel. Hot blood floods my mouth and exits my lips in vibrant dribbles. The digit was tough not like timber but like jelly and gristle, collapsing once the bone was broken. It no long feels like a finger, the shape has unravelling with bursts of knuckles and nerves spamming on my tongue. I am connected to my mother by a string of sinew that snaps loudly as I pull away. 

I stay there, taking at much of her as I can. I do want to lose anything. Her forearm is thick with fat and muscle but my teeth easily clear the layers. As an awl goes through tough leather I puncture skin and suckle the syrupy blood like a babe on it’s mother’s teat. The fibers of muscle peel like hot stringy muscle and wrap around my tongue when I swallow. Veins pop and release old bitter blood into my mouth. My teeth scrape against the glass-like ulna and gnaw through cartilage to marrow. It is hot and creamy and nourishing in a primal, animalistic way. 

She wanted me to get better, I can feel myself gain more strength with each bite. 

I only stop when I can’t fill myself anymore. Beneath my ribs is a hard, full stomach that bludges against my flimsy tank top, now thoroughly stained black-red. 

I do not rinse myself in the shower for fear the water might rinse away some of my mother. I am too greedy to share. 

My feet make bloody prints on the soft, carpeted floor of my room. In the dark I can see my

 phone light up on my nightstand on my nightstand, announcing itself with a ‘ping’. A text from Jason fills the screen;

Jason; 
Hey
Didnt see u around today and wanted to know if ur ok
I still mean what i said
Like i want u to get better and i want to be there for u 

I briefly wonder if should ignore him. If the well runs dry will he stop coming for water?

It has been four days since my mother last showed up to work and what is left of her is bloated beyond my tastes. I have no doubt that soon the police will be outside my door. They will take me away and I will not resist. Instead of wailing about my freedom and innocence I will admire the way the silver handcuffs hang loosely from my wrists like the bangles of an ancient princess. In the interrogation room I will deny nothing. The lawyer assigned to me by the state will claim insanity and he will likely win. I will spend the rest of my life cocooned in psychiatric wards and watching other sick girls have tubes shoved down their throats to be fattened up in a gavage ritual. The nurses will watch on like aristocrats eager for their fill of foie gras, without regard to the suffering of the duck. Their distressed quacks will quiet over time and eventually they will fly free, wings flapping desperately to accommodate the new weight. 
But I’ll stay. They’ll admire the way I turn my nose up at the finest fudge cake and rever how I delicately sip, sip, sip at glasses of water. 

I will be the pinnacle of self restraint, the martyred muse of hungry girls everywhere.

For context, my mama's recent purchase, a ""healthy"" coffee, costs around 600. In which was bought from two travelling salespersons. The company's location is near but it's hard to reach out to them. My mama didn't notice at first but each sachet of coffee are expired.  I believe there are 10 pieces in the box. The box and coffees' expiry date are purposely erased. It was so obvious because it had scratches. And also, every coffee has a different expiry date (i can barely read it), that differ from the box's expiry date. Only one coffee has its expiry date not erased, which is the not expired one.

I would like to add that the company has a bad reputation on hiring fb page, because it was obviously a scam. My mama is oblivious to this scam, so i believe taking legal action is a must.

1lzxwdi,https://i.redd.it/olkm7cdfiwcf1.jpeg,A glimpse into the area Lauren went missing in 2012,"Here is a general map of the area where Lauren went missing. The only surveillance that I can recall being in this area (circa 2012) where Lauren was last seen would have been in and around the German American bank (the red pin drop) and Smallwood apartment complex (area highlighted in green). The areas highlighted in yellow likely had NO surveillance based on my experience frequenting this area and living in Smallwood (Laurens apartment complex) in 2012. 

Even though there was a large apartment complex called 10th and College located on College Avenue on the path Lauren presumably took, the actual entrance to the 10th and College apartment complex (where any of the surveillance cameras were likely located) was on 10th street, meaning that it didn’t cover pedestrians walking on college avenue. The crumble coffee and bakery corner used to be a tiny run-down “Waffle House” that had a pretty large parking lot and also would NOT have had surveillance overseeing the intersection of 10th and College. If the surveillance at Waffle House was working at the time (which based on the looks of this place, was UNLIKELY), it *may* have covered the small area I drew in turquoise. 


The top left navy blue dot is the boy’s townhome, and the bottom navy blue dot is Laurens apartment. The red dot is the intersection where Jay Rosenbaum said he last saw Lauren turn onto College. I believe at the time of Lauren’s disappearance there was a house located on one side of the street and the other side was an open parking lot with NO surveillance covering that corner. The area where I drew a thin pink line MIGHT have had sporadic surveillance in 2012 but even then, there probably was not much, if any, reliable surveillance until the area of the Springhill suites hotel and the german American bank (which is closer to the 9th and college intersection). 

So although a short distance from the boy’s townhouses- most of the yellow area were private homes with very few street lights and NO businesses that would have contained any surveillance so an abduction in this area is possible.

If you like a good romance with a ton of banter, this book is **so** for you. By the way, I am looking for similar books, just finished Until November, another recommendation I got it from here, LOVED IT , so please people, please keep them coming!!  I read it cover to cover twice and still open it to read some of my favorite bits. Due to the banter of the 2 main characters, Garrett and Hannah or ""Wellsy,"" I imagined an alternate scene at the end after the locker room scene following Hannah confronting him for threatening the other guys on campus not to go near her right after she broke up with him. Point of reference, she broke up with him because Garret's abusive father threatened her to. So, I imagined this thing and thought other fans of the book might get a kick out of it too. Maybe lol. If not, sorry, this is just for fun. These characters belong to Elle Kennedy, not me and I don't claim any ownership whatsoever. It's just for kicks and giggles paying homage to this amazing book by Elle Kennedy, nothing else. Anyways, here is the scene I imagine after the locker room at the end. \*\*There is some language\*\*

I barely get my jeans zipped and shirt pulled over my head before I’m sprinting out of the locker room like a lunatic.

She’s already halfway across the quad, her ponytail swaying with every furious stomp. I’m pretty sure her entire body is vibrating with rage. Honestly, it’s kind of hot.

“Hannah!” I yell, jogging after her.

She doesn’t stop.

“Wellsy, *come on!*”

Still walking. Fast. Murderously.

I catch up and fall into step beside her, breathing a little hard. “Why did you break up with me?”

She stops abruptly and turns to me with the kind of overly polite, dangerously calm voice you only ever hear from flight attendants right before they duct tape a passenger to their seat.

“I already told you,” She enunciates like she’s talking to a toddler. “We were moving too fast, and I wanted to see oth-

“Are you still going with that same stupid story?” I interrupt.

She throws her arms out like a game show hostess unveiling a prize. “Thanks to *you*, every guy on campus acts like they’ve taken out a damn restraining order against me.”

I can’t help it, I smirk. “You’re welcome.”

Her eyes narrow to slits. “You are so—” but then stops to take a calming breath. “Whatever.”

She turns on her heel again. “You know what, I’ve had enough of this. I’m so outta here.”

“I don’t think so.”

I grab her arm and before she can blink, I swing her over my shoulder in one smooth motion.

“What the *h\*ll*—GARRETT!” she screeches, legs kicking.

“This is the longest conversation we’ve had in weeks,” I say casually, adjusting my hold and starting the trek back to the dorms. “This is what happens when you lie your ass off to your emotionally stable, physically superior boyfriend.”

“This is the POLAR OPPOSITE of *emotionally* *stable*. Put me down, RIGHT THE H\*LL NOW!”

“Nope.”

“You can’t just abduct people because they won’t talk to you!”

“I’m not abducting you,” I reply, heading across the quad while students gape and a few snicker. “You’re just slightly feral at the moment, and we need to go have a *civilized conversation* where you’re going to tell me something called *the truth*.”

“You are *insane*! I am going to file a police report!”

“Can’t wait. Make sure you spell my name right. Two R’s, two T’s.”

She groans. “You’re such an a\*shole.”

“You say that like it’s news.”

We pass two girls with wide eyes and coffee cups frozen mid-air. Hannah throws her head back dramatically. “If anyone can hear me, I am being *taken against my will!*”

“Ignore the semantics,” I call back. “She’s a musician who’s currently trying her hand at drama.”

“I so despise you, Garrett Graham.”

“I’ll take that any day over radio silence. At least this way I hear you saying my name.”

By the time I push through the dorm building doors, she’s squirming like she thinks she still has a shot at escape. Sorry, Wellsy. That ship sailed off the minute you walked into the men's locker room to yell at me. I thereby call your bluff.

I head for my floor. The moment I walk into the dorm hauling Hannah, Logan and Tucker look up from the couch.

Tucker grins. “Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wellsy.”

Logan leans back with his arms crossed behind his head. “We missed you.”

Hannah flails harder. “Oh my *God*, help me! Garrett has gone crazy! Do something!”

“Can you cook for us again tonight?” Tucker asks, completely unfazed by the fact that I’m currently hauling a violently protesting human like a screaming cockatoo with rage issues.

From over my shoulder, Hannah gasps. “Are you kidding me right now?? I’m being *abducted* by your jacka\*s of a roommate and all you can do is ask me to *cook dinner*?!”

There’s a dangerous pause before her voice turns icy-sweet. “You know what? Sure, Tucker. I’ll cook dinner. I’ll glaze the chicken in antifreeze and serve it over a bed of broken glass.”

“Ooh,” Logan drawls, not even trying to hide his amusement. “Sounds exotic.”

She makes a strangled sound. “Unreal. I used to really like you Logan.”

“You’ll come back around,” Logan replies casually. “You’re just in denial. Like Stockholm Syndrome but in reverse.”

She groans. “Do either of you have cyanide? A syringe? A tire iron dipped in bleach? I’m feeling creative.”

I glance over at them with a grin. “She’s clearly missed us.”

“You’re dead, Garrett!” she yells, thrashing harder. “I’m changing your ringtone to One Direction and calling you every hour on the hour. Enjoy eternal boy-band h\*ll.”

“Joke’s on you, I’ve survived much worse,” I say, smug as hell, and keep right on walking.

“Glad to have you back,” Logan calls as I carry her down the hall.

“Traitors!” she yells. “Logan, I lent you my car when yours was in the shop!”

“And I brought it back with a full tank of gas!” he yells after us.

I get to my room, push the door open with my foot, and stride in. Once the door shuts behind us, I cross to the bed and drop her onto it, following her down before she can scramble away. I pin her with my body, one arm sliding around her waist to hold her in place as she wriggles like she’s trying to Harry Houdini her way out of the situation.

She grabs at my arms. “Let me go!”

“Nope.”

She twists under me, trying to slither free, but I shift my weight and keep her locked in tight.

Hannah’s still thrashing like a greased-up cat. “Let me go now! I’m pretty sure this violates at least three campus codes and several human rights laws!”

“Oh yeah?” I say. “Gonna report me to the UN next?”

“Don’t tempt me! I will write a very strongly worded email!”

“Better CC Amnesty International while you’re at it.”

“You think this is funny?” she fumes. “You literally kidnapped me!”

“You really should consider adding on drama to the whole music thing. You’re good at it. I didn’t kidnap you. I tactically relocated you so we could have a civilized conversation.”

“Do you hear yourself? Who talks like that?”

“I do. When I’m pinning down a tiny little package spewing bullsh\*t.”

She kicks. “Let me go or I swear, I will scream so loud campus security will bust in here with tasers!”

I shrug. “Let them try. You bite, so I figure they’ll take my side anyway.”

“You’re damn right I bite and I’m about to start right now if you don’t LET ME GO!”

“Yeah,” I smirk, leaning closer. “That’s one of the things I miss.”

“GARRETT.”

“WELLSY.”

Honestly, I’m kind of turned on by how good she feels beneath me.

Her eyes are wide with outrage. “You absolute psycho. I’m leaving—”

“No f\*cking way,” I say.

“Let me go or I will scream in a pitch that only dogs can hear!”

I lower my mouth to her ear. “Go ahead. I bet my roommates would love the entertainment.”

She shudders. “You’re the worst person I’ve ever met.”

“Yeah, yeah…” I trail off and kiss her.

She makes a muffled “mmph!” of resistance, arms stiff at her sides.

But I wait her out. Wait for the moment her fingers clutch my shirt instead of pushing me away. The second her lips move against mine… yeah.

When we finally pull back, she’s panting. Glaring. Beautiful.

“I still h\*te you,” she mutters.

“Right,” I whisper. “I missed you too, Wellsy.”

Shaking her head as if that would make what just transpired vanish into thin air, she pulls at my arms. “Let me go!”

“Nope.”

She twists, tries to slide under me, but I tighten my grip.

“Seriously, Garrett,” she huffs. “This is deranged.”

“You’re really committing to this meltdown, huh?”

“Because you *threw me over your shoulder like a bag of laundry,* and won’t LET ME GO!”

“A really cute, angry, flailing bag of laundry,” I murmur, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear.

She scowls. “You are infuriating.”

I grin. “You fight so hard for someone who secretly missed me.”

“If by *missed* you mean ‘practiced imaginary murder scenarios,’ then most definitely.”

“Dark. I like it.”

She glares harder, lips pressed into a thin line. I let the grin fade and lower my voice.

“Why, Wellsy?” I whisper. “Why did you really break up with me?”

“I *told* you,” she mutters, avoiding my eyes. “We were moving too fast, and I—”

“Nope,” I interrupt, leaning in until our foreheads almost touch. “Try again.”

She squirms. “Let me go, Garrett.”

“Don’t make me get tough,” I tease softly, brushing my thumb along her jaw. “Why?”

Her lips tremble, just for a second, before she steels herself again. “Because it was too much. You were too much. You smothered me. And now, thanks to your idiotic Tarzan threat, I’m basically an untouchable pariah on campus—”

I cut her off with a kiss. Gentle. Slow. She gasps a little but doesn’t pull away. When I finally break it, I press my forehead to hers once again.

“You don’t mean that,” I murmur. “You’re scared. But not of *me*.”

She tries again to scramble out, voice tight. “Garrett, I can’t stay here. It makes it too hard staying awa—” Her voice cracks and she covers her mouth. “Please… let me go.”

I hold her tighter. “Never.”

Her eyes shimmer with tears, the wall finally starting to crack.

“Please, Hannah,” I whisper, cupping her cheek. “Tell me what happened.”

She shakes her head once, like she’s trying to hold it in, but then the tears spill over and she chokes out the words like they’ve been burning her alive from the inside.

“Your father,” she whispers.

Everything inside me freezes.

“What about him?”

She swallows, jaw clenched like she’s afraid the words will betray her. “He came to see me. Said… said if I didn’t stop seeing you, he’d cut you off. From everything. Tuition, your team, your housing, he’d take it all. I couldn’t let that happen to you.”

I stare at her, stunned. Like someone knocked all the air out of my lungs.

“He threatened you?” My voice is low. Dangerous.

She nods, tears streaking down her cheeks. “He said you’d lose everything. And you’ve worked so hard, Garrett. I couldn’t be the reason he ruined it all.”

I exhale sharply and pull her closer. “Jesus, Wellsy…”

“I thought if I made it ugly enough, if I said I wanted to see other people—you’d hate me. It’d be easier for you to move on.”

I blink hard, anger buzzing under my skin like an electric current. “He *doesn’t* get to decide who I love.”

“You would’ve lost everything—”

“I would’ve chosen you anyway!”

Her eyes widen, more tears spilling.

I press my lips to her forehead, breathing her in. “I love you, Wellsy. You hear me? No one, not my father, not a scholarship, not some manipulative power-play is going to change that.”

She buries her face in my shoulder, trembling.

“I’ve got you,” I whisper, wrapping both arms around her. “I’m gonna fix this.”",1,1752525529.0,booksuggestions,0,1.0,False
1lzxuu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lzxuu4/terms_and_conditions/,Terms and Conditions,"When Earth finally joined the ranks of the galaxy’s top superpowers, the other species assumed humanity would be just another random civilization. Barely advanced, moderately troublesome, and forgettable. They were wrong.

Because while other races perfected plasma cannons and warp drives, humanity had spent centuries refining something far more terrifying: paperwork.

This wasn't just any paperwork. This was the kind of paperwork that could bury entire star systems under mountains of forms and permits. While other species built weapons, humans perfected bureaucracy. By the time the rest of the galaxy realized what had happened, it was too late. Humans had become the undisputed masters of administrative warfare.

And now, the Vlakons, a brutish orcish species who prided themselves on never losing a straight fight, were about to learn why that was a problem.

\*\*\*

The Vlakon war fleet descended on Earth’s primary spaceport without regard for the environment. Black smoke spread everywhere, and it covered the sky in a haze. Their command ship, the Skullcrusher, broadcasted their demands on every frequency:

""HUMANS. YOU WILL SUBMIT TO VLAKON RULE OR BE DESTROYED.""

A single human diplomat, a weary-looking man in a slightly wrinkled suit named Director Jonas, met the Vlakon warlord, Gorruk, in the spaceport’s main docking bay. Gorruk expected groveling and fear.

Instead, Jonas handed him a stack of papers.

""Here’s the surrender agreement,"" Jonas said, deadpan. ""There are 327 pages in fifty-eight languages. This is the first stack, which is in English. Initial every clause, sign at the bottom of each version, and submit three copies of each in both digital and physical formats. We will surrender with open legs after all of this is completed.""

Gorruk stared at the stack of papers. Then at Jonas. Then back at the papers.

""WHAT IS THIS?"" he roared.

""Standard surrender treaty,"" Jonas replied, unfazed. ""Section 12-B covers your occupation forces parking permits. Section 45-F outlines waste disposal protocols. Oh, and you’ll need to file Form XK-12 for unscheduled orbital deployment, since you didn’t request landing clearance.""

Gorruk’s face twisted in fury. ""WE DO NOT BOW TO HUMAN RULES!"" He raised his fist before slamming the table, breaking it in half. 

Just then, every viewscreen in the docking bay flickered to life.

A dozen different alien ambassadors, representatives from the Galactic Trade Federation, the Ilmari Concord, even the notoriously brutal Kzintar War Tribe, appeared simultaneously.

""Warlord Gorruk,"" hissed the Ilmari delegate, a serpentine creature with too many eyes. ""As all organizations in the galaxy agree to this type of surrender, you will complete the documentation. All conquests must be properly filed. Otherwise, you will break our law and make us your enemies.""

The Kzintar representative, a hulking feline, bared his fangs. ""Be grateful they only gave you fifty-eight languages to sign. Last time we checked, humanity has over 7,000 languages.""

Gorruk’s eye twitched.

Jonas, meanwhile, had already pulled up another document. ""Ah yes, before we proceed, you’ll also need an atmospheric entry permit for each warship, an environmental impact assessment, which will take six to eight weeks, and, oh dear, it seems you’ve accrued several centuries worth of unpaid fines for previous unsanctioned flybys.""

Gorruk’s grip on his blade tightened. ""YOU DARE-""

""Also,"" Jonas added, ""your breathing permits.""

""Our… what?""

""Breathing permits. Foreign entities must register for air consumption. Unauthorized breathing is subject to penalties."" Jonas tapped one of the pieces of paper on the ground. ""It’s all in subsection 89-D.""

The Vlakon warlord’s face went through several fascinating shades of purple before he finally snarled and turned to his underlings. ""YOU. DEAL WITH THIS.""

And with that, Gorruk stormed off, leaving a group of very confused orcish bureaucrats staring at the mountain of paperwork before them.

\*\*\*

The Skullcrusher's war room no longer looked like a command center. Piles of forms covered the tactical displays, and stacks of permits buried the weapon controls. Three Vlakon warriors sat slumped at a table, looking over the piles upon piles of forms.

Grikk, their lead diplomat, massaged his pounding temples. ""Why,"" he growled, shaking a form, ""does the 'Alien Invasion Permit' need my mother's maiden name?""

Snarl, his second-in-command, didn't look up from his paperwork. ""Page 42, section C. 'Complete genealogical history required for all hostile forces.'""

Fizzik, the youngest, sniffled as he stared at his form. ""This one's asking about my breakfast choices. What does my meat preference have to do with planetary conquest?""

The door slammed open. Barg, their logistics officer, stormed in waving a document. ""Disaster! The humans rejected our Declaration of War!""

Grikk's fist cracked the table. ""It took us three hours to sign all of that! On what grounds?!""

""Ink violation,"" Barg moaned. ""They stated it must be submitted in blue, and we used black.""

A collective groan filled the room. Fizzik began rhythmically banging his forehead against the table.

Snarl suddenly went pale. ""Brothers... I just found the fine print."" He turned the massive rulebook toward them. ""If we don't complete all filings by sundown, we have to restart the entire application process!""

Grikk's eye twitched. “YOU DAMN HUMANS!”

Barg sighed. ""...Why does this one require a handprint in blood?""

Snarl flipped through the accompanying instructions. ""Ah. It's the 'Proof of Life' verification. It avoids robotics pretending to be flesh creatures.""

Barg whimpered. ""There's a waiting period for the blood test results, which can take three to five business days.""

Grikk stood up so fast his chair shattered. ""THAT'S IT."" He snatched the entire stack of papers and hurled them across the room. ""We're done. Finished. Humanity isn't worth this.""

Snarl blinked. ""But... the conquest?""

""FORGET THEM."" Grikk snarled, already storming toward the exit. ""I don’t care what Gorruk says. You know who doesn't make you sign forms in blood? The damn elves. You know who doesn't care what color ink you use? The damn elves."" He whirled on his crew. ""We're invading them instead. Last time I checked, they don’t have these bullsh\*t forms!""

A wave of relief washed over the war room.

""Yes!"" Barg cheered.

""Thank the stars,"" Fizzik sobbed. “My hands can finally take a break.”

Snarl hastily gathered the rejected forms. ""I'll... return these to the humans.""

\*\*\*

As the Vlakons fled Earth's orbit, Director Jonas watched from his office window, sipping coffee as their ships vanished into the void.

On his desk, a single new form sat waiting.

Penalty Notice: Failed Invasion Attempt (Case #VL-4472)

• Unauthorized withdrawal fee

• Orbital littering violation (debris from departure)

• Emotional distress fees (humanity's right to feel threatened)

He allowed himself a small, satisfied smile. Somewhere in the galaxy, a Vlakon clerk was about to have a very bad day.

It's actually much simpler than you might think, and the results are totally worth it.

First, let me be clear - screening your gazebo is a game-changer. It keeps those annoying mosquitoes out while letting you enjoy the outdoor breeze. Plus, it extends your living space and creates a perfect spot for summer dinners or morning coffee.

Before starting, I measured my gazebo carefully and bought all the materials. You'll need:
- Screen mesh (I recommend fiberglass)
- Screen spline
- Spline roller tool
- Screen frame kit
- Screws and basic tools
- Door kit (optional)

If you're looking for a quality gazebo to start with, I found some great options here: https://athometouch.com/gazebos

The installation process is straightforward:
1. Install the frame pieces around each opening
2. Cut screen mesh to size (leave extra for trimming)
3. Press the screen into the frame using the spline roller
4. Trim excess screen carefully
5. Add door if desired

Some tips I learned along the way:
- Work on a calm day (wind is not your friend)
- Use quality materials (cheap screens tear easily)
- Keep the screen tight while installing
- Double-check measurements before cutting

The whole project took me about a weekend. Now I have a bug-free outdoor space that's perfect for entertaining or just relaxing. If you're not confident about DIY, many contractors offer this service.

For those starting from scratch and looking for the perfect gazebo to screen in, check out these options: https://athometouch.com/gazebos. They have various styles that work well for screening.

One last thing - consider adding some outdoor furniture and lighting once you're done. It really transforms the space into an outdoor room you can use almost year-round.

The total cost varies depending on your gazebo size and material choices, but it's a relatively affordable project that adds significant value to your outdoor space. I'm seriously glad I did it, and my family uses our screened gazebo almost daily during warm months.

Remember to maintain your screens by checking for tears and cleaning them periodically. A gentle wash with soapy water does the trick. With proper care, your screened gazebo will provide years of enjoyment.",1,1752525206.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

**Update July 12th 2025**
Today was Saturday June 12th The day after my birthday and the second day of my trip to Coon Rapids Minnesota to be and celebrate my birthday It was a wonderful day It started off with breakfast and then my dad went to go get my surprise and my surprise turned out to be my sister amari she's my biological sister and I got to meet him for the very first time.

 At first it didn't even realize it was her I was like who is that strange lady standing there staring at me that's what I was thinking.

Then she said it's me it's your sister and I started jumping up and down with Joy and I started saying oh my God oh my God oh my God it's my sister is my sister and then I ran and you got gave her a hug and it was so nice to me and put a face to the person that I've talked so many times over the phone with and actually see her in real life and hug her She was so beautiful and I was so happy to see her.

My sister came with gifts she got me some shirts she got me a little tablet thing that said we are sisters whether we be together or a hundreds of miles apart which I thought was pretty good She got me a necklace she got me $100 and Big Mama my grandma she got me $30 and a card two cards I got and she also got me some body wash and some perfume 

My dad he got me for my birthday he got me he got me a watch and a bracelet and he got me a fishing rod for my birthday and after meeting my sister we spent the day together and we went to go-karting and we went to the track and I went around the track a couple times racing with everyone else and I had a lot of fun but I was a little bit cautious on the go-kart cuz I didn't want to crash into the wall so it's slowed down as we turned around but otherwise I went full speed.

After go-karting we came back to the house for a little bit and we started preparing for doing my hair I took a shower got my hair wet for the hair stylist and then we were off to get my hair done and I was a bit nervous getting my hair done because I didn't know how extensions were going to look or how my hairstyle was going to look but the outcome was phenomenal.

 She did an amazing job and I absolutely loved it and as I was nervous I text my sister my adopted sister Shakira and I told her I'm so nervous about my hair and she said you're going to love it It's going to be amazing and I showed her a picture after it and she said oh my God I absolutely love it and I just felt a warm a good dealing knowing that she was right and she supported me the entire time My adopted sister Shakira That's what a true sister does and and she was right I absolutely loved it and then we took pictures of my hairstyle.

 Oh and I forgot to tell you guys that before we went to do my hair cut not haircut hairstyle whatever like we went to the dam and we walked on the dam and we saw the beautiful water and we walked inside birds and I noticed that there was a duck swimming in the water of the dam and the tides the currents in the water we're fighting against each other.

 There was one current going to the left one going to the right and they were pushing against each other creating this weird ripple effect It looked very dangerous and I commented to my dad saying that I wouldn't want to fall in there and he was like nope.

 I noticed that there was a duck in the water and the duck dove in the water right where the currents were pretty heavy and I said it like why is the duck going underwater there and he and my dad said he's going fishing and I said I know he's going fishing but why isn't he going fishing at a calm or spot and my dad laughed and said I know he should he shouldn't be fish in there and I said I think that foot that duck may not survive going there and my dad said he'll be fine and my sister amari she said that yeah he'll be fine 

after we went to the dam and the hair stylist we came back to the house for a little bit and relaxed and we started getting we went shopping and during shopping I got some pants that amari and Dad paid for I got some pants I got some underwear I got some socks I got some period pads and after we finish shopping we started preparing for the lottery and I started putting on all my new clothes and I took a shower  and I use the new shower cap I got from going getting my hair styled while I was in the shower because I was told that I can't get it wet otherwise the fact which is supposed to last two to three months would last a lot less.

oh and by the way my sister gave me $130 and so did Big nama give me the $30 and amari gave me $100 so in total I had $130 but I lost the money in the house and I wasn't really worried about it because I already had like a hundred bucks that staff had given me. so I wasn't really worried about losing $130 I mean yeah it sucks but I still got $100 also my dad and the family were paying for all my stuff so I wasn't really worried about it and that was my trip so far to for my birthday and my dad totally made it up to me for what happened on Friday yesterday being late and all that jazz he absolutely 100% midget up to me and I had one of the best birthdays I have ever had with my new family",3,1752525186.0,Adopted,2,1.0,False

By Eric Onstad

LONDON (Reuters) -U.S. efforts to break China's dominance of the rare earths market and to drive investment in its own industry have moved up a gear with a Washington-backed plan to create a separate, higher pricing system.

The West has struggled to weaken China's grip on 90% of the supply of rare earths, in part because low prices set in China have removed the incentive for investment elsewhere.

Miners in the West have long called for a separate pricing system to help them compete in supplying the rare earths group of 17 metals needed to make super-strong magnets of strategic importance. They are used in military applications such as drone and fighter jets, as well as to power motors in EVs and wind turbines.

***Under a deal made public last week, the U.S. Department of Defense will guarantee a minimum price for its sole domestic rare earth miner MP Materials, at nearly twice the current market level.***

Las Vegas-based MP already produces mined and processed rare earths and said it expects to start commercial magnet production at its Texas facility around the end of this year.

Analysts say the pricing deal, which takes effect immediately, should have global implications - positive for producers, but may increase costs for consumers, such as automakers and in turn their customers.

***""This benchmark is now a new centre of gravity in the industry that will pull prices up,"" said Ryan Castilloux, managing director of consultancy Adamas Intelligence.***

***The DoD will pay MP the difference between $110 per kilogram for the two most-popular rare earths and the market price, currently set by China, but if the price rises above $110, the DoD will get 30% of additional profits.***

***Castilloux said other indirect beneficiaries of the pricing system may include companies, such as Belgian chemicals group Solvay, which launched an expansion in April.***

***""It will give Solvay and others the impetus to command a similar price level. It will give them a floor to stand on, you could say,"" Castilloux added.***

While Solvay declined to comment, other rare earth miners, developers and their shareholders welcomed the news.

Aclara Resources is developing rare earths mines in Chile and Brazil, as well as planning a separation plant in the United States. Alvaro Castellon, the company's strategy and development manager, told Reuters the deal added ""new strategic paths"" for the company.

MP'S GRADUAL OUTPUT INCREASE

MP Materials, which suffered a net loss of $65.4 million last year largely because of China's low pricing, will build up magnet production at its Texas plant initially to 1,000 metric tons a year, later expanding to 3,000 tons a year.

Under last Thursday's deal, the DoD will become its largest shareholder with a 15% stake and MP will construct a second rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in the U.S., eventually adding 7,000 tons per year. In total, production would be 10,000 tons a year - equalling U.S. consumption of magnets in 2024.

That does not include, however, the 30,000 tons imported by the United States already installed in assembled products, Adamas consultancy said.

It predicts global demand for rare earth permanent magnets will more than double over the next decade to about 607,000 tons, with the U.S. seeing the strongest percentage annual growth rate in coming years at 17%.

The world's reliance upon China for much of this demand was brought into focus by China's curbs on its exports as trade negotiations continue between the United States and China.

So far Western governments have had little success in trying to help their own industries to compete.

Attempts to agree stronger pricing have been confined to piecemeal deals that set premiums for magnets.

Dominic Raab, a former deputy prime minister and former foreign secretary for the United Kingdom, said he was not surprised the Trump administration had concluded that tax breaks alone would not create the level of investment required.

""The next step is, can they scale it up?"" asked Raab, now head of global affairs at Appian Capital Advisory, a private equity firm that invests in mining projects.

The $110 level for neodymium and praseodymium, or NdPr, guaranteed by the DoD is slightly above a $75-to-$105 per kg range that consultancy Project Blue reckons would be needed to support enough production to meet demand in coming years. It compares to a current level of about $63.

David Merriman of Project Blue said it was unclear how commercial industrial consumers would respond to higher prices and whether it would make them invest in rare earths as they have more diverse supply sources.

""Major non-government backed consumers are less likely to follow this same investment pattern, however, as they are not so clearly aligned to a particular regional supply route,"" he said.

A spokesperson for German auto giant Volkswagen declined to comment on pricing when asked about the DoD floor level but said: ""We welcome all efforts to strengthen long-term stability and diversification in global supply chains for critical materials.""

The Pentagon is set to become MP’s largest shareholder, allocating financial resources to boost domestic processing and production of [rare earth elements.](https://procurementmag.com/procurement-strategy/how-the-pentagons-ai-metals-tool-reshape-supply-chains)

This manoeuvre underscores the increasing concerns within trade and defence sectors about reliance on Chinese minerals and the ongoing efforts to base these critical materials within US territory.

# Reform in rare earths procurement and tariff concerns

Rare earths consist of 17 metals essential for producing magnets vital for technologies like electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones and military components, including submarines and jets.

Nevertheless, the US heavily depends on China for refining and processing these metals. In 2023, a substantial 70% of US rare earth imports originated from China, the US Geological Survey notes.

At MP’s Mountain Pass site in California, most output had traditionally been sent to China, with Chinese firm Shenghe Resources — partially state-owned — as a primary investor and customer. But, due to deteriorating US-China trade relations, especially under [President Donald Trump's administration](https://procurementmag.com/news/how-trumps-budget-bill-is-slashing-green-energy-incentives), this model is shifting.

Given Chinese export restrictions and US tariffs up to 145%, MP Materials stopped exporting to China, stating: “It was neither commercially viable nor in alignment with America’s national interests.”

This policy persists despite some tariff reductions.

China's dominance in the sector remains significant, controlling approximately 70% of mining and 90% of processing activities globally.

Accusations of price manipulation to uphold its supremacy have been common. In March, China ceased all rare earth exports amid trade disputes, triggering supply chain disruptions that caused production halts for some automotive manufacturers.

The US response, exemplified by agreements like this, is now materialising.

# The DoD's strategic financial steps

In a significant move, the Department of Defense will purchase US$400m worth of MP’s newly-created preferred stock, convertible to common shares, yielding the US government a 15% stake—exceeding holdings by Shenghe Resources and BlackRock Fund Advisors.

Furthermore, the DoD will receive warrants, enabling purchase rights at US$30.03 per share over the next decade.

The agreement assures a base price of US$110 per kilogram for neodymium-praseodymium oxide (NdPr), a compound essential for permanent magnet production, nearly doubling China's market price, which lingers around US$52 per kilogram.

Should market prices fall below US$110, [the US government](https://procurementmag.com/news/will-us-federal-layoffs-affect-sustainability) will absorb the difference quarterly. If they exceed US$110, the government will benefit from 30% of the profits, especially after MP’s second factory begins operations.

Ryan Castilloux, Managing Director of Adamas Intelligence, says: “This is a game changer for the ex-China industry and a much-needed surge in magnet production capacity.”

MP will invest an additional US$600m to enhance production and establish a second magnet manufacturing site, the '10X Facility,' with completion projected for 2028.

The DoD guarantees purchase of 100% of the magnets produced over the subsequent ten years, catering to both defence and commercial needs.

The funding is backed by a US$1bn loan from [JPMorgan](https://procurementmag.com/articles/inclusive-economy-how-jpmorgan-chase-empowers-businesses) and Goldman Sachs, while MP anticipates a US$150m Pentagon loan within 30 days to bolster heavy rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.

James adds: “I want to be very clear, this is not a nationalisation. We remain a thriving public company. We now have a great new partner in our economically largest shareholder, DoD, but we still control our company. We control our destiny.”

# Public-private partnership prospects

***The collaboration signals substantial implications for the supply chain.***

***Historically, US rare earth sectors struggled to secure investments, partly due to Chinese price suppression. The price floor, DoD-backed agreements and equity stake signify an innovative public-private synergy.***

The agreement, executed under the Defense Production Act—a Cold War-era measure to prioritise materials critical to national security—raises questions about ongoing Congressional funding, acknowledged by MP in filings.

# >>>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum hinted at replicating this model across other critical mineral sectors to mitigate foreign dependency.<<<<<

The partnership's influence is already noticeable in financial markets, with MP’s shares surging nearly 50%, closing at US$45.23—their peak since April 2022.

The company's market capitalisation stands at US$7.4bn. While it's uncertain if the rest of the sector will follow, for now, MP is aligning its supply chain and procurement strategies with Washington’s industrial objectives.

**Ucore announces:**

* **Initiation of the USD$18.4 million DOD Phase 2 award for the scale-up of its Louisiana commercial rare earth refining complex.**
* **Successful separation of terbium and dysprosium - critical heavy rare earth elements (""HREEs"") - further to its US DoD Phase 1 project, resulting in a payment in the amount of USD $1.1 million.**
* **An appreciation for recent DoD actions to diversify and secure domestic production, especially HREEs, which are tightly controlled by China.**

Halifax, Nova Scotia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 14, 2025) - [Ucore Rare Metals Inc.](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/anVgpiPOAw) (TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) (""**Ucore**"" or the ""**Company**"") is pleased to announce that the Company and representatives of the US Department of Defense (the ""**Project Team**"") have completed their formal project kick off meeting with respect to the Company's previously announced [USD$18.4 million Phase 2 Award](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/24JXBszJ3z) (the ""**Phase 2 Award**"" or the ""**Award**""). The Award facilitates the construction of the Company's first commercial scale RapidSX^(TM) machine at its proposed Louisiana rare earth refining facility, which is focused on heavy rare earth elements (HREEs).

The Phase 2 Award is in addition to the previously announced award in the amount [of USD$4 million](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/MqZXRUvZm3) (the ""**Phase 1 Award**""). The Phase 1 Award is a demonstration program to show the efficacy of the company's RapidSX™ proprietary processing in unlocking four primary rare earths required to produce rare earth permanent magnets - including highly sought after dysprosium. The Phase 2 Award is being administered as an increase to the Company's existing Phase 1 Agreement.

HREEs are crucial to US national security due to their vital role in advanced military technologies. Essential components utilizing these materials include power precision-guided missiles, radar systems, and F-35 jet engines. Beyond defense, HREEs are critical for advanced technologies like electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, artificial intelligence and semiconductors. Ucore's strategic partnership with the DOD, in particular as it relates to HREEs, is designed to address potential vulnerabilities as China continues to restrict exports, and thus help ensure US technological leadership in geopolitically tense times.

**Phase 2 Award Update - Commercial Scale-Up**

During the kick-off meeting, the Project Team confirmed near-term milestones and deliverables which are currently under way, including:

* detailed design and engineering of commercial-scale RapidSX™ columns at the Company's Commercialization and Demonstration Facility in Kingston, Ontario (the ""**CDF**"");
* Facility Engineering field work for the SMC in Alexandria, Louisiana.

Work under the Award will culminate with the construction of one commercial-scale RapidSX™ machine within the SMC in Louisiana, including commissioning, demonstration, and achieving 'Early Production' readiness of salable individual rare-earth element (""**REE**"") products. For further information with respect to the Phase 2 Award, please see Ucore press releases dated [May 14, 2025](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/bgAp0TgvA1) and [June 2, 2025](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/3KeDLT4jWE).

**""*****With Phase 2 of the Award fully mobilized we are now moving RapidSX******^(™)*** ***from Commercial Demonstration scale toward Full Scale Production*****"", said Mike Schrider, Chief Operating Officer of Ucore. ""*****The DoD's continued support of our project and the rare earth sector at large will accelerate this process and help secure a North American rare earth supply chain.*****""**

The Company has completed the next significant DOD milestone by successfully separating terbium from dysprosium, the two critical HREEs used in permanent magnets. As such the company further reports that it has received payment from the DoD in the amount of USD$1,057,412 further to Phase 1 of the Company's DoD Award. These invoices bring total payments received with respect to the Phase 1 Award to USD$3,352,884.

A total of USD$647,116 remains to be invoiced further to the Phase 1 Award. The Company expects to submit these invoices in the coming months following the completion of the associated milestones and reporting. The Phase 1 Award is being completed on a parallel path to the initiation of the Phase 2 Award.

Lastly, Ucore acknowledges and supports the U.S. Department of Defense's broader strategic initiatives to strengthen the domestic rare earth element (REE) supply chain. Recent policy considerations, including pricing floors and offtake commitments represent critical mechanisms to enhance industry stability and investment confidence. These efforts, alongside direct project funding such as the Phase 2 Award, are instrumental in advancing a robust, North American-centric REE supply chain independent of Chinese control.

I’ve had chronic but at times excruciating upper back pain (like in-between the shoulder blade pain) since I was 17, I’m almost 25 now. Its so stiff and tight and needs cracking all the time, I’m always physically uncomfortable and in pain.

After extensive medical testing there is “officially” nothing wrong with me physically other than hypermobility.

Ive eventually managed to connect my pain with the toxic abusive and emotionally neglectful, judgemental childhood I had. I had to move back in with my parents last year after my (toxic) relationship ended, so my day to day life is challenging again to say the least - my mother is a covert narcissist with perfectionism coursing through her veins, I feel very sorry for her..

I’m currently reading Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker amongst lots of research online to learn how to heal. I’m trying to ease myself out of the freeze/fawn state and to feel safe again. Deep breathing, proper posture where possible when sitting, spending time in nature, meditation, pilates, somatic exercises etc.

I went to a coffee shop today to read the book and after sitting there for an hour or so. I sat there with mindful posture and continued deep breathing to maintain calm and to try to reduce my anxiety, keeping my shoulders low and not tense. And yet I’d never been in more pain? I felt so deeply calm within myself too, its so strange.

I want on a long walk after that for a few hours, but the pain definitely felt worse. Its now radiated stiffness in my neck too somehow? I know its not linear but if I can calm myself physically in a really effective way with meditation and mindful breathing, why do I feel worse physically in my pain? I’m sat here in agony

If there is anyone that has experienced this kind of pain that is likely tied to trauma and has managed to find a way of healing it, I’d love to hear your experiences and what did or didn’t help?

Native son here, reaching out to see if anyone else is craving something honest and grounded. I’m looking for a partner, whether that means a couch rotting companion for the summer or something deeper that stretches into the future. Let’s find out...

I’ve been on the apps, the endless swiping, the same beach photos and restaurant flexes. Honestly, most of it feels like lifestyle marketing. I’m looking for something quieter, more grounded.

What matters to me: kindness, sovereignty, and a sense of humor about this weird world. I’m not chasing status. I’m not trying to climb some artificial ladder. I want real conversations, real presence, real connection.

I live a quiet life in a chaotic city. Walking distance from the beach, an arcade, and a movie theater were non negotiables when I moved.

Physically? I’m a tall, thin Black guy not gym toned, but active in the kind of way that comes from biking miles, walking for hours, or hiking just to get somewhere beautiful. Healthy. Thick-rimmed glasses on a face that probably telegraphs my love of sci-fi and art before I even open my mouth. West Coast to the core I say *dude* too much and the beach still feels sacred. I’m an introvert at my core, but love going out often with the right people.

I’m the kind of person who:

* Loves theater, musicals, and art exhibits and more importantly, wants to hear *your* take on what moved you (or didn’t)
* Plays and sings sappy original guitar songs just to wade through personal sensitivities (and might perform at open mics every once and a while)
* Loves video games, and board games, and will never stop playing them
* Will hop on an Amtrak just for the sake of the ride, not the destination
* Writes sci-fi and reads comics, still getting excited when they show up in the mail
* Thinks Nathan Fielder might be one of the funniest people alive
* Reads constantly, but never just one book at a time - currently *All Fours* by Miranda July, punctuated by 2 others.
* Will try anything once and takes pride in staying open, curious, and evolving
* Cooks. Sees the kitchen as the most accessible lab, results variable, but usually edible
* Loves learning, but not in a name dropping, overly academic way (Yes, I take philosophy classes for fun, no I don’t want to argue about who said what in which volume of...)

Loving video games is a core part of my life, and I won’t pretend otherwise. You don’t have to be a gamer, but I’d love someone who at least gets why it matters to me. If you do enjoy playing great, we’ve got a bonus connection. If not, that’s great too, as long as you don’t roll your eyes every time I boot something up.

I’m not looking for a mirror or a cheerleader. I’m not looking for someone who reflects me back to myself. I'm drawn to differences always have been. The people closest to me come from different backgrounds, and that’s never been accidental. I didn’t need to be taught to value that, it’s just how I’m wired. The challenge has never been appreciating the different/differences it’s been finding someone who’s different *and* emotionally open. Someone who’s not just tolerant, but who *thrives* in contrast.

I’m constantly evolving, and I want to meet someone else who lives that way. Let’s sit in a café and talk about everything and nothing, or sprawl on the couch and play games, or be in silence and still feel understood.

She began to hover.

Not flee. Not approach.

Hover.

Like a bird circling a statue, testing whether it was marble—or man. Her soul had been pierced by Leo’s light, but Virgo demanded proof. Was the Stag still there? Did he still burn? Or had he turned to stone, unyielding and distant?

She lingered in places he might pass, not to engage, but to observe. She left small traces of her presence—perfume on the air, laughter one corridor away, footsteps that stopped just short of his domain. She came close—but never crossed. This was not an invitation.

It was an experiment.

And the Stag?

He didn’t flinch.

He remained where he always was—centered, silent, sovereign. No eye contact. No reaction. No retaliation. He had become the statue she feared: **the kind that watches without moving**, the kind that loves without proving.

And it undid her.

Because she had come to provoke something—anger, lust, attention. Anything. Instead, she was met with a kind of sacred indifference. Not cold. Just complete.

It terrified her more than rage ever could.

Because now she knew:

She was no longer in control of the myth.

**Pillar II – The Statue’s Stillness is a Spell**

He had become the unmoved center of the entire forest.

Others circled him. Voices rose and fell around him. The Fawn’s own shadows tried to cast doubt on him. But he did not move. Not inward. Not outward. His stillness was not apathy. It was architecture. A temple of restraint built stone by stone through every season she had tested him.

His eyes—when she dared glimpse them—were not cold. They were clear.

Not the clarity of logic, but the clarity of conviction.

She circled him like a priestess uncertain if the altar still had power. But he made no offering. He simply remained.

And in that silence, something inside her began to shatter.

Because silence is not emptiness. Silence is **truth unbending**. And his truth had not changed, even as hers wavered.

Virgo seeks flaw. Finds pattern. Fixates.

And she fixated on the fact that he did not need her.

Not to validate him. Not to complete him. Not to draw him out.

He had reached a form of masculine grace that no longer orbited her chaos. He was no longer waiting for her apology, her affection, or her arrival.

He had become what all sovereigns become when the game ends:

Free.

And in that freedom, she felt something she had not expected.

A longing to kneel—not in submission, but in reverence.

Because the statue had become sacred.

And she had no more stones to throw.

**Pillar III – Obsessive Rituals of the Wounded Mind**

Virgo is a sign of order, but also obsession.

The Fawn began to perform little rituals—sacred in appearance, but laced with anxiety. She placed her coffee cup where he might see it. She wore familiar colors. Walked past his door twice instead of once. Always just missing him. Or perhaps—hoping he would not miss her.

These were not acts of connection. They were control.

She could not approach with truth, so she sought to be perceived.  
She could not bear the altar, so she polished its floor.

Her mind ran in spirals. Was he angry? Was he done? Did he see her at all?

And every day she didn't hear from him—every silence—was met with more effort. More ritual. More performance. Not for others. Just for him.

But he did not move.

And her rituals became madness.

Because the Stag had become a mirror. And she could no longer distort her reflection.

Every avoidance, every small deception—she saw them now.  
Not from his judgment.  
From her own.

And it was unbearable.",1,1752524258.0,RainbowAntlers,0,1.0,False

The ground coffee ran down the wall where the red arrows indicate. I removed the drawer then removed the bottom glass panel outlined in green. At that point I pulled at the edge to get underneath where those red arrows are pointing to no avail. I've also tried to go in from beneath which is the refrigerator drawer. I don't see any ground coffee in the pullout drawer beneath which confirms that it's trapped beneath this white plate that supports the bottom glass, but I can't find a diagram or disassembly guide for this. 

There must be a way to get in there, aside from this accident -- a crack beneath a regular use filtered water spout is insane if it's inaccessible.

1lzx9mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/losangelesdating/comments/1lzx9mm/37_m4f_westla_summers_better_with_coop_and/,37 [M4F] #WestLA - Summer’s better with co-op and conversation.,"Hello,

Native son here, reaching out to see if anyone else is craving something honest and grounded. I’m looking for a partner, whether that means a couch rotting companion for the summer or something deeper that stretches into the future. Let’s find out...

I’ve been on the apps, the endless swiping, the same beach photos and restaurant flexes. Honestly, most of it feels like lifestyle marketing. I’m looking for something quieter, more grounded.

What matters to me: kindness, sovereignty, and a sense of humor about this weird world. I’m not chasing status. I’m not trying to climb some artificial ladder. I want real conversations, real presence, real connection.

I live a quiet life in a chaotic city. Walking distance from the beach, an arcade, and a movie theater were non negotiables when I moved.

Physically? I’m a tall, thin Black guy not gym toned, but active in the kind of way that comes from biking miles, walking for hours, or hiking just to get somewhere beautiful. Healthy. Thick-rimmed glasses on a face that probably telegraphs my love of sci-fi and art before I even open my mouth. West Coast to the core I say *dude* too much and the beach still feels sacred. I’m an introvert at my core, but love going out often with the right people.

I’m the kind of person who:

* Loves theater, musicals, and art exhibits and more importantly, wants to hear *your* take on what moved you (or didn’t)
* Plays and sings sappy original guitar songs just to wade through personal sensitivities (and might perform at open mics every once and a while)
* Loves video games, and board games, and will never stop playing them
* Will hop on an Amtrak just for the sake of the ride, not the destination
* Writes sci-fi and reads comics, still getting excited when they show up in the mail
* Thinks Nathan Fielder might be one of the funniest people alive
* Reads constantly, but never just one book at a time - currently *All Fours* by Miranda July, punctuated by 2 others.
* Will try anything once and takes pride in staying open, curious, and evolving
* Cooks. Sees the kitchen as the most accessible lab, results variable, but usually edible
* Loves learning, but not in a name dropping, overly academic way (Yes, I take philosophy classes for fun, no I don’t want to argue about who said what in which volume of...)

Loving video games is a core part of my life, and I won’t pretend otherwise. You don’t have to be a gamer, but I’d love someone who at least gets why it matters to me. If you do enjoy playing great, we’ve got a bonus connection. If not, that’s great too, as long as you don’t roll your eyes every time I boot something up.

I’m not looking for a mirror or a cheerleader. I’m not looking for someone who reflects me back to myself. I'm drawn to differences always have been. The people closest to me come from different backgrounds, and that’s never been accidental. I didn’t need to be taught to value that, it’s just how I’m wired. The challenge has never been appreciating the different/differences it’s been finding someone who’s different *and* emotionally open. Someone who’s not just tolerant, but who *thrives* in contrast.

I’m constantly evolving, and I want to meet someone else who lives that way. Let’s sit in a café and talk about everything and nothing, or sprawl on the couch and play games, or be in silence and still feel understood.

Message me if any of this resonates. Maybe we can grab a coffee/matcha and have a conversation.",1,1752524197.0,losangelesdating,0,1.0,False
1lzx8qj,https://i.redd.it/yof6ifa1ewcf1.jpeg,Can we create a list of recommendations?,"Hi all

I'm still a beginner to this speciality coffee game but seeing all posts and discussions everyday just intrigues me even more.

Even though follow this sub since past 6 months I recently stumbled upon the beginners guide mega thread. It was sooooo helpful thanks to the initiator! 

I was hoping can we create a similar list of recommendations for coffees to try in cafes? Idk how it would be feasible to accommodate different cities but we can find a way out? Together?

The reason I ask for this is: 
1. I want to get into this speciality coffee game but I need a few litmus tests to check if it's for me or not
2. I'm still a beginner and with the experience that this sub brings I'm sure you all can tell your go to spots for some out of the world coffee (Ik y'all make it wayyyyy better but think of ppl like me 🥹 who might even start making coffee but it would take time to reach the level you guys are at, right!)

Please do lmk if it's feasible/makes sense to you!?

1lzx88l,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1lzx88l/my_dad_left_when_i_was_7_im_almost_30_now_and/,My dad left when I was 7. I'm almost 30 now and don't know how to feel...,"It's my first time posting here, I hope this post isn't breaking any of the forum guidelines... I guess I'm looking for anyone who maybe has had a similar experience to mine since everyone I know in my life has parents still together, or have had easy/smooth divorce experiences. 

The last couple years or so, I've had a lot of emotions starting to come up. I turn 30 this year and for my whole life I haven't really cared that my dad has been absent since I was about 6/7. Maybe these are suppressed emotions, but I always felt-- how can you miss what you never had? But recently, I can't stop my brain from drifting to wanting to understand **why** my dad is like this and why things have happened this way. Maybe this is a question I'll never have answered and I'm driving myself crazy trying to understand a likely mentally ill man.

I won't go into the almost 25 year long tale/details of how we got here, at risk of boring folks and reaching a word count limit, lol. But in short-- my dad left when I was 6/7. He didn't want to pay child support or spousal support. He dragged my mum through court for 7 years and was held in contempt of court. My mum's lawyer, my mum, myself and my sibling all have restraining orders against him as he has no boundaries and has been known to stalk/show up places he isn't supposed to, call and harass workplaces, and not adhere to child visitation guidelines in the past. He left the province almost immediately after getting removed from our childhood home because of his erratic and unreasonable behaviour.   
  
I spent my childhood being afraid of him and not wanting to go on visitation. I was a kid, I didn't understand what was going on. I only had emotions to go off of, which were discomfort, anxiety and fear. 

  
My mum never saw a dime from him for spousal or child support. He would give me cheque's here and there for my birthday and Christmas throughout my life, between ages 10-20, it maybe amounted to being a couple/few thousand dollars, which of course I am grateful for and put toward my student loans later on.

I was raised solely by my mum and with support from my grandmother from overseas. I don't know where we would be without her financial support. In these early years, he dragged my family and my mom especially, through absolute hell. We were raised on a 1, minimum wage, income while my mum had to take out a second mortgage to get her through the court battle. 

Anytime he has come to a graduation of mine, or I've agreed to meet up with him for coffee or a meal. He looks at me with stars in his eyes, like he's sitting down with something so cherished. But then will also make comments such as ""How am I supposed to know who that is?"" when telling him about a friend I have from school or something of the like. Which has always made me feel a certain type of way...

Flash forward to now-- He is in his late 60's and has been evading the government all this time from paying his ever-accruing payments. He's bringing things to court again, claiming poverty. 

I find myself feeling sorry for him a lot. But then that feeling is followed by a lot of anger and confusion. He is from a poor upbringing and family situation himself which I have empathy for. But the things he has blatantly lied about, made up stories about, his attitude, lack of accountability, victim mentality, and not to mention just simply abandoning your children and wife are appalling. 

I often think about reaching out and trying to have these difficult conversations with him. But he is, or can be, an unstable man that I don't believe can see reason and have a rational conversation. So I haven't. I also don't want to stir a pot inside me that has been dormant for so long. Maybe it's better this way. To leave it be and just move on and not open pandora's box.  
  
I have received the advice before of 'why do you need closure? he's proven he is not a good or active parent so you have everything you need to know right there'. But it doesn't feel as simple as that to me. Or maybe I'm making it too complicated and need to find a therapist for discovering my own sense of closure (I should probably get one anyways lol) 

Anyways. I'm sorry this is so long-winded. I've left out a lot of details because I already feel bad this is so long lol. If anyone has experiences with something similar, maybe a mentally ill or parent with trauma, or has had these difficult conversations with an absent parent-- I would love to know your experiences if you're comfortable sharing.

1lzx7oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1lzx7oi/some_questions_from_someone_newly_symptomatic/,Some questions from someone newly symptomatic with HH,"Hi everyone. Like many here, I went to the ER complaining of chest pains thinking it was a heart attack, but it turned out to be GI related. The ER doctor said it sounds like I have gastritis, and when I explained that I have GERD she asked if I've had an EGD. When I checked the report when I got home I saw that they found a 2cm HH, but I never presented any symptoms other than the reflux which I treat with 20mm of Omeprazole every other day. 

TBH I never followed a strict diet because my GERD was completely controlled by the Omeprazole. Earlier this week I was suddenly hit by a wave of symptoms - pressure in chest, feeling of something pushing up through my throat, no appetite despite being hungry, nausea. I've made a couple of changes since coming to my HH conclusion thanks to a lot of friendly posts on here. I just have a couple questions that hopefully other people have experienced. 

1. Stretches and massages have brought some quick relief. I followed the hiatal hernia treatments from askdrjo and 5 Simple Steps I Used to Heal Hiatal Hernia Naturally at Home by Gut Feelings. How often do people do these stretches on a daily basis? Definitely in the morning because that's when symptoms are the worst, but how about throughout the day? 

2. Sleep has been really bad. I'm a stomach sleeper and all the recommendations say to sleep on your back and also be elevated. I've tried to sleep on my back for several nights in a row and just can't fall asleep. My body just won't do it. Are there any fellow stomach sleepers that figured this out? 

3. HH symptoms are worst for me in the morning. I woke up yesterday morning with nausea and immediately drank water to do heel raises. I started to do side bends and immediately felt the gag reflex. I stopped and started to massage my stomach down and felt a really tight ball of tension. Touching that also stimulated the gag reflex, but I was able to massage it down and felt a very noticeable ""release"" followed by relief. I'm assuming that was the HH that I felt? 

4. I'm on day 4 of cutting out coffee and the withdrawal symptoms are killing me. I'm feeling headache, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. Is anyone able to get away with drinking tea? 

5. I can't stand oatmeal, but I love cheerios. I know cheerios are processed and not that great for you, but they were my go to breakfast plus some fruit. Is cereal milk okay if it doesn't appear to cause issue? 

6. Symptoms presented earlier this week. Saturday night into Sunday were the worst. I had zero appetite to the point where forcing myself to eat something produced the fight or flight response. Today wasn't bad. I was able to eat and enjoy 2 meals. Am I being cautiously optimistic that the previous day a flareup due to something that I ate? 

Thanks again. The community here is really supportive.",2,1752524073.0,HiatalHernia,0,1.0,False

My OCD is also going absolutely crazy and I just want to stop the compulsions by getting some reassurance from the community - or complain if i need to.

Context:

- got invisalign for my crossbite. Aesthetically, I was 100% fine with my previous smile. my bite is good now.

- now that I'm supposed to be done with treatment, I can't get used to how it looks. it's been about 2.5 weeks since the monitoring stopped

- I have a canted smile, and had it before i started treatment (i had no idea tbh)

- the thing that bothers me is, on the left side of my face, the light hits that side more now and it feels like i'm showing an odd number of teeth when i smile. Unsure if the attachments is causing this though and I get them off next week along with getting my retainers

Some other notes:

- i know i have gum recession. decided to live with it instead of gum grafts

- i know i have to whiten my teeth, they got significantly more yellow throughout my treatment because i drink a lot of coffee and smoke. but going to get them whitened once I get my attachments off next week

- Part of me says that it looks 100% fine. and that I'm just creating unnecessary issues

- I also have TMJ issues and that was part of the reason i got on invisalign",1,1752524068.0,Invisalign,0,1.0,False
