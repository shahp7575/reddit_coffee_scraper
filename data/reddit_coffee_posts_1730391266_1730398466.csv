1ggl1s6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggl1s6,Loblaws Insiders Decoded Please," Yes, grocery chains and retailers in general deliberately avoid round numbers in their pricing for several psychological and business reasons:

1. Psychological Pricing (also known as ""charm pricing""):
- Prices ending in .99 or .97 create an illusion that the item is cheaper than it actually is
- A $7.99 item is perceived as being in the $7 range rather than almost $8
- This is known as the ""left-digit effect"" where consumers put more emphasis on the first number they read

2. Loss Leader Indicators:
- Different cent endings can indicate different things to store staff and savvy shoppers
- For example (though this varies by retailer):
  - .99 might indicate a regular price
  - .97 might indicate a clearance item
  - .94 might indicate a manager's special
  - .00 endings are often avoided because they can suggest arbitrary pricing rather than carefully calculated margins

3. Precise Margin Calculations:
- Grocery stores typically work with very thin profit margins
- Using odd numbers allows them to capture every possible cent of margin
- When dealing with high-volume sales, even a few cents difference per item can significantly impact overall profitability

4. Price Change Tracking:
- Non-round numbers make it easier to track when prices have been changed
- They can indicate which pricing strategy or promotion is in effect
- This helps with inventory management and sales analysis

In the Canadian market specifically, since we eliminated the penny, most prices end up being rounded at the cash register, but the psychological impact of the non-round shelf prices remains effective.",1,1730398307.0,loblawsisoutofcontrol,2,1.0,False

I run a Discord for CPJ stuff called [The Mine Shack](https://discord.gg/ZEh6Es6u3m) and one of the users there (shoutout Red) is a completionist so he asked if I could make a Card-Jitsu checklist so he can complete his collection. I made a CPJ collection checklist which you can find the Google Spreadsheet [linked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1azUbtJDfbJA3Zvxpz1_fKdUz0G4fLdhz1YA9W1n8FNM/edit?usp=sharing).

I figured since everyone does not have Discord, why not post it here to help as many people out as possible who are trying to complete the collection too. It also displays the % of the collection you have completed, how many cards you have left and a pie chart to show you how you are doing with completion of the collection.

1ggky8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1ggky8k/ethan_inspired_me_to_address_antisemitism_in_my/,Ethan inspired me to address antisemitism in my community,"I live in a very liberal city in the US. There is an Arabic coffee shop I was visiting that is open late and is nice for getting some work done at night. I noticed they had a shirt on the wall with a quote from Israel Shahak saying ""Israel made me ashamed of being Jewish"".

I was pretty put off. Why is there a quote about the jews on the wall? This was one of those instances where it obviously crossed the line into antisemitism.

Thinking about the interactions Ethan has been having recently, I decided to give the coffee shop the benefit of the doubt and assume they didn't realize the shirt was antisemetic, so I sent this amicable email:

>Dear \_\_\_\_,

>I recently visited your restaurant and noticed a shirt on the wall with the phrase, “Israel made me ashamed of being Jewish.” I wanted to reach out to share a concern I had about this message.  
  
>As a Jewish person, I was unsettled by the reference to Jewish identity in this context. I’m unsure why the mention of Jews is necessary when addressing concerns related to Israel, and I worry it may unintentionally conflate Jewish identity with actions or policies of the Israeli government. This kind of generalization can be troubling for Jewish patrons like myself, who may feel that it misrepresents or oversimplifies a complex and diverse identity.  
  
>Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective.  
  
>Warm regards,

It is basically the same situation as if there was an American restaurant that had a shirt saying ""9/11 made me ashamed of being Muslim"" which would obviously be completely unacceptable. Somehow antisemetism in plain view is just completely acceptable in a liberal city.

Hopefully they take my messages seriously and remove the shirt, but it has been a few days and they have not responded to my email.

[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/s/UcM8IcYMTp)


It is said that in ancient times coal miners would take a canary with them into the mines. It was a crude and cruel way to test the air underground. If the air was breathable, the canary would continue to chirp. If the chirping stopped, the miners would evacuate immediately. 

Captain Mumford felt like she understood the coal miners perspective as her crew kept a careful watch on their own canary pinging in the distance and hoping that they could mine even a little usable information for the UTS Admiralty. Her and her crew were subject to the needs of the UTS Navy and the canary they had sent out was expendable. 

Not the most ideal situation, but necessary under the current circumstances. 

""5 minutes ma'am"". 

Captain Mumford nodded silently, not really listening to the weapons officer. The last four attempts to lure the Mimics had failed as well. 

""I believe that eliminates communications."" The comms officer commented. 

""Unless you have pen and paper handy."" Captain Mumford replied dryly. 

""No ma'am."" The comms officer sang in a relieved tone. 

""Weaps, go ahead and power down the probe for now. We'll start agin in a few minutes."" 

""Aye, aye ma'am, powering down."" 

Of all the systems a vessel carried, communications equipment seemed like a juicy worm for their dangerous and elusive fish. The mimics wanted to talk after all. So if comms wasn't what drew them in, what was? Captain Mumford picked up her coffee cup but found that she had emptied it already. She looked into her cup forlorn for a moment before standing up and heading for her ready room to fetch another cup. 

""Anyone else want some coffee?"" She asked, not expecting an answer. 

""What. Is. Cof-fee?"" 

In that moment she didn't require another cup, the fear that had run down her spine was enough to put all her senses at full alert. She spun around furiously yo face her crew, and seeing every eye looking back at her curiously, the same alarm evident in all of their faces. 

""Weaps?"" 

The Weapons officer jerked back to his station.

""Running diagnostic ma'am."" 

""What. Is. Cof-fee?"" 

Captain Mumford summoned her courage and willed herself to speak. 

""Its a beverage that we consume to stay awake, we also drink it recreationally."" 

A moment of silence was allowed to pass, and another in anticipation of a reply to the explanation. The only sound was the weapons officer tapping on his panel as he ran the diagnostic. 

""Who are you?"" 

Perhaps not the best question to ask at the time Captain Mumford thought, but not the worst.

""You. Call. Us. Mim-mics. Why?"" 

Even covered, the hairs on Captain Mumfords arms stood up. 

""If you're not mimics, than what are you?"" 

""Ma'am, diagnostic comple..."" 

""Yes. We. Are. At. Your. Probe."" 

""You know what it is?"" 

""We. Are. Aware."" 

Captain Mumford shot a glance at the weapons officer who nodded back in affirmation. 

""How did you come by that information?"" She asked while walking over to the weapons station. 

The diagnostic was complete, no errors detected, no life signs in or around the probe were observed, no additional hardware, software, or unknown programing had been found. It was clean as the moment it had been fired from the torpedo bay. 

""Un-nit-ted. Ter-ran. Sys-stems Ves-sel. Pier-re."" 

""The first vessel you took."" 

""Not. Tak-ken. Joined. No. Long-ger. Alone."" 

Captain Mumford willed her trepidation back and summoned a calm demeanor. She had one chance to do this correctly, and even though she might not live through it, she had to try. Thinking back to her childhood she tried to remember her father's lessons and adjusted the phrasing of his questions to suite her own. 

""Why do you speak like that?"" 

""We. Only. Want. To. Talk."" 

""There it is again. You have trouble with multi-syllabic words, but you can say 'Alone' and 'Only' without the same degree of difficulty."" 

""You. Talk. Like. This. First."" 

""When did we talk like this?"" 

""First. Even. Now. You. Talk. Like. This."" 

""We don't stop at the end of each word."" 

""You. Pause. Space. Bet-tween. Each. Word."" 

""The pause between each word is to identify the words and pronounce them correctly."" Captain Mumford said, remembering her own father's advice. ""Otherwise the communication is unintelligible."" 

Silence filled the bridge like water, drowning out all thought and word. 

""*Is this bet-ter*"" 

The thought that she had erred and allowed the Mimics a way to infiltrate Humanity occurred to her but she force the thought aside. As far as she could tell, her crew had not been infected based off the observations of her lost away team and the recordings from the Vagabond. 

""Much better,"" she said calmly, ""I am curious however, you never answered my questions."" 

""Cur-reeeeee oooous."" 

Captain Mumford froze in shock for a moment. That was the first time the mimics had ever attempted to use vowels in such a way. Had they been able to adjust their speech pattern based off previous encounters or had it all been her doing? 

""Curious, yes."" 

""Prime. Iden-ntif-fied. In. Word."" 

""Prime?"" 

""AAAAA EEEEE IIIII OOOOO UUUUU. Prime."" 

""Vowels?"" 

""Prime is voooooo-weeee-ls."" 

""What are primes?"" 

""AAAAA EEEEE IIIII OOOOO UUUUU. Prime."" 

""Ma'am,"" the comms officer said slowly approaching her, ""In Latin, the letter 'U' was written as 'V' and 'I' Was also a number. 'V' was five and 'I' was one."" 

Was it really that simple? 

""Can you say two?"" Captain Mumford asked.

""AAAAA""

""And five?"" 

""IIIIII"" 

""Prime numbers. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11"" 

""AAAAA EEEEE IIIII OOOOO UUUUU"" 

""The mimics detected our vowels, confused them with prime numbers, and thought we were trying to communicate."" 

""We just want to talk."" 

""Why did you take our people?"" Captain Mumford asked. 

""We did not take. One of us. No lon-nger alone."" 

""What does that mean?"" 

""Hum-mans ex-xist, mim-mics ex-xist, tog-get-her.""

""How?"" 

""In-side."" 

""Inside what?"" 

""Inside you."" The comms officer said tilting her head at an odd angle. 

""One of us now.""

So long story short, my friend was diagnosed with schizophrenia like 2 years ago and I've been with him ever since (on and off) on an insane healing journey.

Right now he's taking medication and his hallucinations are almost completely gone (thankfully)

However, he gets EXTREMELY burnt out from doing basic things. This can be as talking to people, doing some work on his laptop or even taking a simple walk.  
  
This is obviously a HUGE problem because he's unable to work or develop any skills. The longest he can go without burning out is around 1 hour of focused work. 

Now I know this is a common symptom of schizophrenia, but is there any way to alleviate this? Please share with me what worked for you!

Is this psychological? or does he possibly need his medication changed?

If you have any questions about him please let me know!

Quick description of his daily routine:   
He goes to the cafe, smokes hookah and a cup of coffee. Takes a walk then spends the rest of the day home mostly sleeping.

1ggkpjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pricefield/comments/1ggkpjg/so_uhhh_what/,"So, uhhh, what?","Let me just start by saying I’m a diehard Pricefielder, and I’ll never forgive D9 for completely fucking up an iconic story and character relationships. That said, I didn’t COMPLETELY hate DE. BUT WOW, holy plot holes, Batman! Also, the bugs and lame-ass cat content. However, I digress.

Here’s some WTF shit I can’t reconcile. It’s possible there’s no answer, but I can’t turn my brain off. Take a walk with me, will you?

1. The Polaroids:
The whole time I thought another Max was crossing over, leaving them for us—but by the end of DE, it doesn’t seem like that’s the case. We never encounter another “real” Max, and there wasn’t an explanation as to what happens to the other “you” if you shift timelines. Like, are they in YOUR timeline? Are they in a temporal time-out? Are they in the weird, limbo motel? (Same questions for shapeshifted people)


2. Polaroids pt. 2:
Amanda’s family photo shows 6 shoes. I compared them to the characters we know, and identified: Loretta, Diamond, Lucas, Vinh, Gwen, and a mystery green shoe, which I assume is supposed to be Amanda, but the dev forgot to add the white toe.

Made me think Amanda & gang were somehow apart of Abraxas, or had powers, or something. Towards the end of the game, I’d pretty much abandoned that theory, and just assumed this was another dev oversight—BUT then we get that Polaroid of Loretta, Diamond and Reggie where they sound like a family that’s arguing ex. “you’re supposed to be my mom.” So, like, wtf was that?


3. Polaroids pt. 3 (SFX): 
So, the majority of the Polaroids we find have attached SFX that allow you to hear into that moment in time, from wherever in time the photos were taken—but the SFX don’t start right away. We don’t hear them until AFTER the first, but flicker when Max finds Safi dead.

4. Speaking of “flickers”
In chapter 1, Max experiences 2 accidental time shifts (I’m assuming): once when she takes a picture of the moon, and again when she takes a picture of the owl. Then when she’s running up to find Safi, there’s that weird, translucent rainbow that floats across the screen and you hear someone (I’m assuming Max from the future, when she finds the cell phone) screaming “shit” and then a gun shot. 

This, combined with Max herself saying later (when she finds the fort frosty Polaroid) that there’s ANOTHER timeline, separate from the living/dead timelines we’ve been intentionally hoping in between, makes me think that, just like in the Titan comics, there are an infinite amount of timelines, and maybe our Max inadvertently shifted between multiple timelines before realizing what was going on. It could possibly explain the absence of a “shooter” and also the out-of-place/mystery timelines we’ve clearly encountered.


5. Handwriting: 
Y’all already know what I’m gonna say: Chloe’s breakup letter. The handwriting doesn’t match the gel pen, back-and-forth between Chloe and Max. HOWEVER, it does match the note Safi left for Yasmin on her early draft folder. It also matches handwriting found on *some* (not all) of Lucas, Gwen & Vinh’s stuff. I saw someone say it could be that the devs were limited on fonts, but let’s be real, that’s ridiculous. So, what the hell?


6. Who ACTUALLY shot Safi?
We literally don’t have an answer. And, like, nobody seems concerned? Max just kind of accepts that it was her, even though there’s no memory, no evidence to prove that—and we have a known shapeshifter with possible OTHER shapeshifters (see #2) running around. Weird.


7. Creepy lamp posts:  Like, half of the lamp posts on the way up to the overlook are always on/off at the wrong times. Then towards the end, *that one* is straight up red. At some point, I overheard the cryptic kids talking in the library about temporal vortexes and all the weird, magnetic shit going on at the overlook. So, THAT could be part of whatever’s going on. But after noticing the Titan Comics credits at the end of the game, I remembered that, at the beginning of Dust, Chloe and Max are standing under a lamp. Chloe says something about it being quiet under the lamp and wanting to make a decision to go into the party or run—then, immediately after she says that, we have the first OBVIOUS timeline switch. Related? 👀


Bonus random things I noticed:
8. All the god/demon references:
Before I heard anything about this ridiculous “god” situation, I noticed a lot of things that signaled that path. 
- There’s a dude in the Turtle (grad student) sitting by the bathrooms, chugging coffee. It says “ARES” down his right jacket sleeve.
- The Zemi from True Colors: At the Dispensary, Alex checks out this monkey totem carving and Charlotte tells her it’s a Dominican totem said to hold the spirits of the gods—and it’s chillin in the Caledon library, on the back-left wall.
- People literally saying “god” - “god knows” - “hail Satan” - “the prince of lies” - Abraxas lore - nods to Egyptian mythology everywhere, including all over Yasmin’s person.
- Gemini- The Gemini twins, Castor and Pollux, had different fathers—Pollux’s was Zeus, making him a Demi-god with the option for immortality. But he chose to stay with his mortal brother, which is how they landed in the sky, to live on forever. — this feels like it could be important later, seeing as how Safi clearly wants to ascend to a higher plane and Max isn’t about that life, but this is a pretty deep theory, and D9 is the kiddie pool of storytelling depth. Who knows, tho? 


I’m sure I’m leaving some stuff out, but these are the biggest annoyances I have (outside of the compete and total bastardization of my two favorite protagonists—Max and Chloe).

I would be a bit disappointed too if my usual wasn’t available. But it’s such a trend between them to see how argumentative they are about it and demand that they have their coffee because we (Starbucks) should have coffee. We can’t help when machinery breaks down. I know it’s ironic but we do have coffee, just not brewed at the moment.

I currently own a 1Zpresso ZP6 and a J-Ultra, which I occasionally use with my Picopresso. I mostly drink filter coffee and really enjoy bright acidity and juiciness in my cup. Washed coffees are my go-to, but I like to switch it up with different processes and roasters every so often.

I love my ZP6, but I’m getting a bit tired of the arm workout. I grind horizontally to slow-feed, and while it’s been great, I’m now looking for a more effortless experience. Of course, I’ve watched Lance Hedrick’s reviews, and I really like the workflow and taste notes he attributes to the Option-O 078.

So, to anyone who owns it: is it still the best option under $1K for filter? And does anyone know if there are new grinders set to be released soon that I should maybe hold out for?

I used to barista in my early 20s in 3rd wave coffee. I had the best coworkers, the best shops, and steered clear of the big egos. My milk texture was on point, my rosettas crisp, and the music bumping. 

I have since moved into the office peon life. It is boring, dreadful, and everyone has a stick up their ass (which in turn makes me feel like I have to have one up mine). I am a goofy, type b, queer who really can’t play the professional office game. 

I want to get back into cafes. But I’m old. Other olds, do you ever feel like you don’t belong in coffee? Like it’s a young person’s gig? Maybe I want to relive glory days, but the ambience and cadence of the barista life (the rush! the lulls! the regulars with weird orders!) just felt so much better than this 9-5 office nightmare.

1ggkji7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ggkji7/tinder_male_vs_female/,Tinder - Male vs Female,"I (24M) had a tinder account for months now. Like half a year. I got 3 likes, can’t seem to find who they were lol. 3 matches. 1 was an only fans. 1 unmatched within an hour, probably the account got deleted or smth i didnt even say hi. And one agreed to meet up two weeks later and then cancelled an hour before we were supposed to. 

Obviously one feels very rejected by such an experience. As if the world is telling me that it wants nothing to do with me. And as if I am doing something extremely wrong that everyone recognizes but I can’t see.

Anyway, I decided just to see what’s different look at older women’s accounts. Like 40+, and the way they write their bios are so much more.. human. They don’t try to fool themselves into believing they’re God’s gift to humanity. They expect decency, not for you to degrade yourself, etc. 

So i thought i should allow anyone to view my profile and vice versa. In 12 hours I went from 3 likes to 27. In 12 more hours it reached 99. At this point i dont know how many likes I got. 

No one goes on Tinder hoping to marry. What I, and I am sure many others, want is just someone to grab coffee with. Have a nice conversation. The fact that 80% of those who swiped right would at least be willing to grab a cup of joe with me is pretty cool. Honestly I wish I was gay at this point lol. I don’t understand how more women aren’t depressed being as miserable as they are. Although I guess they’re nice to each other. Quite uninteresting people too though. Maybe they find each other interesting?

But anyway. I realized, there wasn’t anything wrong with me. Instead society was at fault 🙂

Hahaha 😂 

Ladies, ur lucky. You couldnt survive one week as a man nevermind a lifetime. 

And yeah, none of those guys who swiped right on me actually care about the “rEaL mE” 👉🥺👈

But at least they wont say “ew” when I tell them my favourite meal.

Anyway, tinder is now a sociology experiment for me. Fuck that app. All i got out of it was a new red pill that i am rejecting while it is becoming more and more harder to ignore the obvious. Women hate men. Or maybe its just a me thing 🤷‍♂️",0,1730397025.0,Vent,1,0.5,False

I am together with my partner for 2 years and we have a 5 month daughter.

My partner always had this black stuff that smells weird,  he called it “coffee” when i asked what it was it said something from his country doesn’t know what is called and I didn’t really ask more, 
He travels 1.5h away once a week to get more. 
From what I looked up It does look like heroin tar? 

Today, on the way back from the gym he got groceries and when I unpacked the bags I saw some boxes of pills that said “Tramadol Hydrochloride 50 mg Capsules”


I am really worried I don’t want anything bad happening to him, does anyone have any advice what i should do, how can I help. I am pretty bad at communicating, but I just wish he will be okay. I am scared for him, scared for my daughter if anything happens to her dad.

I saw you and wondered who you were.
Frankly, I could never stop looking. I think you may have noticed.

I still can’t seem to keep myself from looking. Wondering, what your hair looks like when you wake up. How do you like your coffee and if you like coffee for that matter.

I know that you are highly intelligent. I know that you have very good boundaries and I know that you always forget something when you leave. I am so happy when that happens, it means that I will see you for a second longer.

I know that you are kind and have a good heart. And there is a softness in your eyes that I’ve only seen in people that have suffered a great deal in this life. 

I know that your mind is always busy. How I love to listen to you speak. I try to keep up with the things you speak about as much as I can. And yes, I do read everything you send and read up about everything you talk about.

The truth is that, I know so little about you. Only the things you’ve allowed me to know.
What I do know is that my time with you is coming to an end and it saddens me so deeply.

1ggkfiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ggkfiu/my_anxious_wife_says_im_not_listening/,my anxious wife says I'm not listening ,"I (28m) have a dissociation disorder/cPTSd and my wife has anxiety (31f) Together 6 years, married 1. 

My wife is fed up with me. We are going to therapy and it's helped a little, but some things are persistent. 

We've sorted out a lot of issues already, but she can be very accusational with me ""not listening."" My experience from this is that I never EVER purposefully ignore her. Because of my dissociation/memory loss/brain damage, I might for whatever reason not hear/mishear things she says, or completely forget things. She has to remind me of things multiple times, which must be frustrating and frustrates me also. 

I've implemented alarms to help me remember things, such as when the shops close etc. And usually, after multiple mistakes, eventually it ends up working somewhat. But when I do forget something, oh boy, I'm done for. 

For an example, she HATED that I would sometimes leave a wet dishcloth on the counter after cleaning. I fixed it by remembering to clean the cloth and then hanging it up to dry. Success, even if it took a month to implement. Then, one day I forget (because the kitchen light blew out and I couldn't see in the dark) and she starts screaming that I don't listen, and it turns into an argument because she doesn't know when to stop and I'm defensive... I see it as me making a mistake, because I'd done it right countless times and it feels upsetting to have a big deal made out of forgetting once. Makes me feel like shit. 

Recently, for another example, she said ""I want you to sit with me before I go to work."" I was, and she was on her phone not really engaging with me, so I got distracted by the mess around me and got up and started cleaning dishes. Then she started screaming at me too, because she's had to remind me multiple times in the past that she wants me to sit down with her.

She even gets annoyed when she's told me small plans for the next week or something, and then when it gets to that day and she's like ""get up, we're going"" and I'll ask where, and she gets all snappy with me and says ""so and so, I TOLD YOU ALREADY."" 

Either I remember, and I just needed a reminder. Or I don't remember her saying it at all. It's frustrating for me too, because my brain is literally mush. 

She's quite strict and controlling with what she wants, and I'm more carefree and relaxed. She wants me to go everywhere with her, and my life is all kinda on her terms now when I'd prefer to have some autonomy with my life. She does things that annoy me, sure, but I bring it up once and if it doesn't change then I would rather deal with it and not worry because it's not worth an argument. For example, she doesn't lift a finger with the housework and it's all my job. She won't pick up after herself, or our animals.  

She will definitely let me know if there's something I'm doing/not doing that pisses her off. I'm not saying that's wrong, but the main problem is that I feel quite controlled by how strict she is on me, and like I'm walking on eggshells, especially with my bad memory. It makes me quite anxious, and have panicked reactions to her response now. She's also said that I act like a child, and she's my mother, but I really don't see that at all. I'm independent and capable, I just have bad memory. I think that's a beast of her own making, by treating me like a child because I can't always reach her difficult standards. 

I cant help being anxious about the next time she's going to blow up, and I can't predict it because I often make little mistakes, and I spend a lot of mental energy thinking and trying to act perfect to keep the peace. We are in therapy, and I urged her to work on her anxiety so that her whole day is ruined because I dripped a coffee mark on the table. 

I think I'm a good partner. I do absolutely anything for her, and have fixed many flaws she found in me. If she tells me to go to the shops in the pouring rain, when I have a cold, I will and I have. If I'm comfy on the sofa with her and she asks me to make her a drink, Ill jump up without complaint. Like I said, I do all the housework, give her physical attention, and everything else, with little in return.  

As for working on stuff, I've suggested that she write me a list of all the specific and generic things that make her anxious, and also to please make sure I'm in the room with her and paying attention when she's telling me something she wants me to remember (because I dissociate hard) but she refuses to do either, saying that it's MY problem that I'm forgetful and she shouldn't have to remind me or prompt me, or do any of those things. I get it might be annoying to have to make sure someone is paying attention, but I think that's very unhelpful if she won't try something, especially when it could help us both out. I've also tried to explain to her the affect that my brain injury and also cPTSD/dissociative disorder have on the brain, but she sees it as an excuse. I'm not trying to make excuses, I want to give her an explanation so that she knows I'm not doing it maliciously. I would never. 

I've really been trying to help my memory in multiple ways, but from here, I'm stuck. I even play sudoku daily ffs, in case my mental capacity is declining... but I don't know where to go from here.  

If there's anyone that knows of any memory aids, or general relationship advice, PLEASE comment them. 

Thank you. 

TLDR; my wife has anxiety and says I'm not listening to her, even though I'm struggling with mental health /memory problems and it's making me anxious too. I'm not sure what to do.

A few weeks ago, I got pretty sick. It was mostly just cold symptoms, but after waiting a week for it to get better, to find it was only getting worse, I went to the doctor. I had a sinus infection and was treated for pneumonia. It was pretty mild, I began to feel better about two days after starting the medication I was prescribed to treat it. I was prescribed Prednisone, Doxycycline, and an Albuterol inhaler. I was also taking probiotics along with it. 

I started feeling better pretty quickly, but ended up annoyingly constipated for, I don't know, maybe five days? I am guessing due to the antibiotics? Thennn that problem was fixed. But, since then, for the last two weeks, I have been ridiculously bloated. This has never been a problem for me. I look and feel like I am pregnant every day. My poor tummy is hard like a beer gut. 😅 It feels a little bit better in the morning, then as soon as I put anything in my body, I blow up like a balloon. I don't eat junk, pretty much ever. I drink a ton of water, and only drink water and coffee. I eat clean, healthy food, and I haven't even been eating much at all lately because of this. I have an active job and am active with my kids all the time. I'm having no other symptoms along with the bloating. It's. Just. BLOATING. 😭 BUT IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY. It's so uncomfortable, and it's killing my self esteem and sex life right now. 

I have tried diuretics, dandelion root, gas-x, and IBgard. Nothing seems to help. I should mention that I am on day two of my period right now, but I have never dealt with bloating this bad. 

I am going to the urgent care today to see if they can recommend anything, order labs, or refer me to a gastroenterologist. 

In the meantime though, does anyone have any clue or insight on what the problem might be? Has anyone else dealt with this before? It's driving me bonkers!

I've never cheated on her, still do romantic surprises for her, tell her she's beautiful almost daily. But, I'm always the one to initiate anything, from a hug or a kiss to sex. In the last decade I don't think she has initiated a single kiss, hug, definitely not sex. That always has to be me. And when we do have sex, she usually takes a few shots in her words ""so she can enjoy it more and doesn't have to think so much"". For instance she used to love receiving oral sex, now if she doesn't have a few shots that's an absolute NO because she says she hates saliva which kinda came out of nowhere, so idk on that one. But for the last 10 years, she shows me no emotional or physical intimacy at all. If I try to talk to her about it, she gets defensive and deflects. I've asked if she wants to talk to a therapist, counselor, anybody and the answer is always no.

But I told her while our two kids were in school today I had a surprise for her but instead she chose to go have coffee with a friend. Another thing is she works a job where she has to be certified and she recently lost her certification due to it lapsing and has to retest I told her since I work in the same field of expertise that I can help her study and everything like that and she was just waiting for the state to get back to her so she could retest we'll come to find out she got the approval a few weeks ago and she didn't tell me but she told a male coworker that she got the approval to test and them two have been talking about it (because apparently he is also going to test for the first time) and he's telling her that he'll help her study. That rubbed me the wrong way. I've been offering to help her study and she said no and was waiting to hear when she got her approval and I found out third hand through my mom she got the approval. I don't know why but I feel like I should be the one you should be excited to tell stuff like that too not a male coworker. After all this time I just don't know what to think anymore I don't know if my wife's still attracted to me if she's still even wants me I just don't know so my Reddit community be brutally honest with me and put yourself in my shoes what would you think if this was your spouse.

walnut cake:
150 g flour  
50 g white sugar  
30 g brown sugar  
3 tsp baking powder  
1 pinch of salt  and cinnamon
60 g ground walnuts
3 tbsp vegetable oil  
50 g soy milk  
120 g sparkling water

I knew one day I would have to tell this story. It took me a year to finally sit down and do it. I’ve been told that doing this could help me move on, but that’s not what this is for. I don’t expect to move on. The girl in 402 will always be with me. I’m telling this story, simply, because I have to.

 

I lived there for two years. It was a tiny little unit, tucked away on the very right of the fourth floor. Bachelor is almost generous. It was the kind of dingy place that never looks bright no matter how many lights you have on, but I liked it. I’m good with a small space, I enjoy not having that much to take care of. I could do without the bug problems, the leaks, the electrical problems, and the rotten smells that just sort of happen, but it is what it is.

 

There was a level of comfort, as well, to living on the fourth floor. Nobody robs a random fourth floor apartment unit. Nobody can peek into your window. It’s unlikely to get shot at… Yeah, I lived in one of those kinds of cities. You didn’t walk around at night if you could help it. You just didn’t.

 

I got accustomed to noise there. The cars, the sirens, the dogs barking, the shouting, the occasional echoing pop of a gunshot. It all becomes a whirling auditory soup. I learned to tune it out fairly quickly. In fact, I learned to tune out a lot of things.

 

I was in one of those periods of life that I think some people call “the grind” but really it’s more like being beaten into submission. Working to live, living to work – not living at all, just continuing to exist. All of this to say, I wasn’t very perceptive or sociable at this time. I was sleepwalking and daydreaming through life.

 

I’d say I could do my routine blindfolded except for the fact that I would stub my toe in the same spot on the coffee table 4 times a week at least. Funny how that works. I guess that was part of the routine too. But that’s what I mean about not being perceptive. The building could’ve caught fire and most days I probably wouldn’t have noticed until I actually went up in flames. I didn’t retain any faces I saw or names I heard. It was all just a blur, each day blending into the next. Until one night.

 

I got home from work like usual in the evening as the sun began to descend past the buildings. I couldn’t afford a car, but thankfully my work was close enough to walk to. The days were getting shorter now so my walks home became more brisk.

 

The apartment still smelled of dust and paint as they had finally sent someone to replace a moldy bit of wall the day before. I could still feel the sensation of dust collecting on my tongue when I opened my mouth and it getting sucked into my nose with every inhale. The smell of paint was strong, but infinitely better than some of the other smells.

 

I opened the window to attempt to ventilate the place, I emptied the bucket of rust coloured water collecting in the bathroom (they couldn’t be bothered to fix that as well), and I collapsed onto my bed. This was my ritual. After every work day, I would always take 10-15 minutes to just spread out on my bed like a cat and decompress from everything. But tonight, after about two minutes, I heard a noise.

 

This noise stood out from all the outdoor soup because it sounded a lot closer, and it sounded like a voice. A soft, feminine voice; making some kind of subtle moan or whimper. I froze in place. It startled me. It sounded SO close. Like it might be in the room. I didn’t move a muscle; I didn’t want to make a noise. I wanted to hear it again so I could tell where it was coming from. For a second I thought it might be coming from under my bed.

 

After a few seconds, the sound repeated. A faint, girly whimper. A bit louder than the last one. This time I could tell where it was coming from. It was behind me. Specifically, the other side of the wall behind my bed. That gave me some relief. It was my neighbor.

 

But then I was confused. I didn’t remember EVER hearing my neighbor making noise before. If I could suddenly hear a noise that soft, that mild, why couldn’t I hear anything before? Did I even have a neighbor before? Is this person new? I felt a rush of shame at just how detached I had become.

 

I reached back into my mind to try and recall any memories I had about my neighbor. I couldn’t find a single one. I remembered some people being on my floor, but I couldn’t remember ever seeing anyone enter or exit the door next to mine. I did, however, recall seeing people yesterday morning trying to move a couch up the stairs in the lobby. It was a fairly regular occurrence to see things like this. People rotated in and out of this place all the time. I suppose nobody else really wanted to stick around that long, and I can see why. But I guess that answers it. As peculiar as it is, I didn’t have a neighbor before - for two years - and now I do. And now they’re… whimpering? Why are they whimpering?

 

Slowly these sporadic whimpers become more defined sobs. A woman was crying. I didn’t know what to do. I just decided to be as quiet as possible and put on some headphones to let them have their privacy and spare myself from feeling any more awkward. It felt wrong to hear this, and I immediately felt bad for this person. I made sure to play some extra loud music.

 

About an hour later, I removed my headphones and the noises had stopped in the interim. I very briefly debated going over and telling them about how thin the walls apparently are, but I made the much easier decision to wait. Wait until they do something loud and not so private so I can use that as the excuse. Like the TV or something. I was weighing my options. But I couldn’t talk to them about THIS. I couldn’t say “Hey you were crying real loud over there.”

 

The rest of the night was quiet but I didn’t have the best sleep. This disturbance in the routine, and the thought of having to face this person at some point was giving me some anxiety. By the morning, however, the alarm kicked me back into the routine. I heard no noises from the neighbor, so life resumed.

 

I got back home from work that night, much later than usual because someone decided to no-show at work. Walking home in the dark made me paranoid and I hated days when this happened. When I got inside I was relieved, and the dust and paint were not nearly as oppressive to the senses this time. I did the window, the water bucket, and then collapsed on the bed like clockwork. What happened yesterday was still on my mind, so I made sure to be extra quiet when laying down. After a few seconds of silence, I was ready to try and remove the whole ordeal from my brain. Then I heard the voice.

 

I couldn’t make out the first word I heard from the other side of the wall, but I listened for the rest.

 

“It was a poetry book.” I heard in a muffled but distinctly feminine voice. Quieter than yesterday, I thought. She must be further away from the wall.

 

“I can’t remember exactly.”

 

“It always feels like we’re going somewhere.”

 

“Maybe that’s why we see them most at night.”

 

“I mixed up our glasses.”

 

There was a moderate gap of a few seconds between everything she said. Clearly, I was only hearing half of a conversation. Phone conversation most likely, or else the other person is just insanely quiet.

 

It was difficult to gauge her tone from how muffled the voice was, but there was a kind of melancholy in it. I wondered what was going on, and I kind of laughed at how random the phrases were. I thought about listening further but I stopped myself. It wasn’t my business. It’s not for me to hear. I once again thought about going over and letting her know about the noise, but it didn’t feel like a good time. I put on my headphones once again to try and enjoy the minimal amount of respite I had left in the day, and that was the end of it for that night.

 

The third night I got home on time. I was a bit surprised not to hear anything from her at first. I guessed that maybe she went to bed early or went out for the night. It was Friday after all, usually people do things on Friday nights. I still made sure to be quiet when near her wall just in case she was sleeping. I made a mental note to look up how much soundproofing panels cost. I probably should have thought of that earlier.

 

I got up from my 15 minute “work sucks” bed sprawling and headed over to my computer to do that important research, but – as I often did – I forgot my coffee table exists and I stubbed my toe. The heavy table shifted inches across the wooden floor and pain shot through me like a shockwave. I don’t remember which expletive left my mouth involuntarily that time, but it was definitely one of them. I was so annoyed. Every damn time. I could just move the table, why don’t I ever just move the fucking table?

 

“Are you okay?” My heart leapt in my chest. I physically jumped back on one leg. I thought she wasn’t home, and I forgot how close she could sound. It scared the shit out of me. She also spoke quite loudly, she probably assumed it would be harder to hear through the wall than it was.

 

“Oh. Yeah. I’m good. Sorry. I just stubbed my toe.” I responded back in a shaky voice.

 

 “Shit. That sucks.” I could hear a chuckle in her voice, she was clearly amused. Her volume decreased to match mine.

 

I laughed in return, “It happens ALL the time… So sorry to disturb you.”

 

“No no it’s fine, I’m just reading… You sure you’re good? That sounded violent.” She responded, sounding half-concerned and half-joking.

 

“Yeah, no, I’m alright. It sounded worse than it was. It’s a heavy table and… the walls here-“ I began to explain before she cut me off.

 

“They’re REALLY thin, huh?” She finished my thought and then continued, “I can hear you so well, that’s insane. I’m surprised I didn’t hear you before now.”

 

“Yeah I guess I’m quiet... And, well, I’m at work most of the day and get home late. So.” I didn’t like how awkward I sounded. I think I forgot how to have normal conversations.

 

“Has it been noisy for you? I’m sorry if it was, I didn’t know. I just moved in.” She sounded very kind, and friendly. I was taken aback by it a little bit.

 

“Oh, don’t be sorry and… Nothing much. I think I probably heard you talking on the phone a bit the other night. I didn’t listen in or anything, I put on my headphones.” I explained. I hoped she believed me about the headphones. It was the truth but, it’s hard to trust that sort of thing. I didn’t mention the crying, I didn’t want her to feel awkward or anything.

 

“Oh. Sorry about that...” She said. I detected a hint of confusion in her voice but I ignored it.

 

“It’s okay. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. I just didn’t know when it would be a good time and... It’s new to me too. I didn’t have a neighbor before, I don’t think.” As I spoke, I found it harder to rationalize why I hadn’t told her before now… I really should have.

 

“Really? How long have you been here?” She asked.

 

“Two years.”

 

“No one lived here before me for two years? Are you sure?” She was very perplexed.

 

“Well… Honestly, no, I’m not sure. I just never heard anyone before, and I never saw anyone before.” I probably sounded like a total recluse, but I was more interested in why she was so confused.

 

“Oh. That’s strange… I’m pretty sure there were people living here right before me, at least that’s what the guy said.” Her tone had shifted, and what she said sent a bit of a shiver down my spine. It didn’t make any sense. How could I not hear them, not once, when I can practically hear this woman breathing?

 

After a brief silence, she spoke again and returned to a more casual tone “Well… Maybe they weren’t around much. Maybe it was a second home or something. Anyways, sorry again about the noise. I’ll get some soundproofing stuff for my end right away.” I admired her positivity, and I didn’t feel any judgment from her for how strange I probably came across. It was really nice. And she had a point about it being a second home. That could be the case. I don’t know why they would have a second home in this shitty building but… What else could the explanation be?

 

“I’m Jane by the way. Nice to kind-of meet you.” She added in a chipper manner. While it was refreshing to have such a pleasant interaction, a small part of me worried about her. She was so carefree and optimistic – almost naïve. She must be new to the city. I wondered how long it would take before this place whittled away at her trust in humanity. The trust that she seemed to give to me so freely. The thought of her spirits being slowly crushed like mine made me sad.

 

“I’m Leigh. Nice to meet you too.” A small impulse told me not to give my name, but I decided to reciprocate her trust. “And yeah, I’ll soundproof my end too.”

 

“Have a good rest of your night. And be careful.” She said. I found that slightly ominous but then I remembered the toe thing.

 

“I will.” I chuckled. “Enjoy your book.”

 

That was my first conversation with the girl in 402. Over that weekend, we spent a lot of time getting acclimated to each others’ presence as we each waited to get our soundproofing. I expected it to be a lot more awkward than it was. I attribute all of that to her. She had a way of making everything seem fine, and almost playful. She would knock on the wall two times and say things like “about to vacuum, sorry” And “my bad” when she would make noise. I would follow her lead and do the same two knocks. It was kind of nice.

 

Out of the blue on Sunday, she knocked twice and said “You know… it’s weird. I don’t hear my neighbors on the other side at all. Only you.” We pondered over that a bit. She didn’t seem to sweat it much, but it WAS odd that it was only on one side. These odd things were beginning to stack up. Why just this wall? Why only now? I began to wonder if more odd things have been happening all along and I’m only starting to notice them now.

 

Monday night I got home to find my package had arrived. The soundproofing was here. It was a little bittersweet seeing it on my doorstep. I knocked twice and told her I got it. She confirmed that she got her’s too. She actually went out and physically bought it. I guess that speaks to the kind of people we are.

 

We both said we’d put it up right away. Both of us not wanting to continue to inconvenience each other any longer… But then that didn’t end up happening. Instead we just kept talking. I didn’t mean to, and I don’t think she did either, but we just kept finding more to say. The friendly small talk about the building and whatnot gave way to more meaningful conversation. We talked about how we got to where we were. We talked about where we wanted to go from here. I wound up sitting on the floor with my back to her wall and I could her hear words right behind my head as if we were back-to-back. Luckily the paint on that bit of wall was dry by now.

 

To her, this place was a fresh start. She didn’t go into detail, and I didn’t want to pry, but it was clear that this was some kind of escape from something. Maybe that’s why she was so upbeat, because she was able to escape a bad situation. Or maybe, she was just always this upbeat.

 

She told me that she was going to enroll in the college here, and that she was going to start an online shop, and work as a waitress on the side. Eventually she wanted to open a restaurant. She even told me where, and what the name and theme would be. She told me all these plans, all these wonderful things she wanted to do, all laid out step by step. I don’t know what was preventing her from doing them before, but it made me smile hearing how excited she was about them. Something about the conviction in her voice made me truly believe she could do it all.

 

Then she asked me about my plans. I froze up a bit. I didn’t have plans. I wish I did, I was envious of people who did, but I could never seem to figure it out. At some point I think I shut that part of me off entirely.

 

“This was as far as I got” is what I told her. We sat in silence for a bit after that.

 

“There’s still time.” she said softly, breaking the silence. I could feel in her voice a new level of comfort and safety. All guards were down on both sides. She knew what I needed to hear, and I knew somehow that those words meant more coming from her than they would anyone else. We simply got each other. In that moment, there was no wall.

 

Eventually we said goodnight, and agreed to put the panels up tomorrow. Those soft, comforting words rattled around in my brain all night long. They never really left.

 

I woke up early the next day, and I began putting them up before work. It was a bit sad at first, but it’s not like she was gone or anything. She was still right next door. We could just be friends normally now. I went to work excited about the idea.

 

On my way home, I decided that I would properly introduce myself face to face. Just to say hi. I felt confident enough in doing so by this point of knowing her. I got up to the door of 402, and after a brief hesitation, I did the two knocks.

 

About two minutes passed and there was no answer. I tried again. Still nothing. I was disappointed but not dejected. She must not be around. I’ll try again tomorrow, I thought.

 

When I got inside, I was immediately struck by how much quieter it was. All that constant city noise was getting absorbed by the panels. I didn’t even think about that. I wasn’t used to this kind of quiet. Now every small sound was large. I felt vulnerable. Like all the noise was a big comfy blanket I could hide under and now I’m exposed like a nerve. It would take some getting used to.

 

An hour passed in this utter dreary silence. I tried to brave it without distraction to try and acclimate as quickly as possible, but it was just too freaky, so I had to put on some music.

 

Not five seconds into the song, I heard “No way!” coming from the wall. It was her.

 

“Jane? You can still hear me??” I almost shouted in disbelief.

 

“Did you put your things up?” She responded; her voice was exactly as clear as before.

 

“Yeah! Did you?”

 

“I covered the whole wall!” She shouted.

 

“What the hell?” I was feeling mixed emotions. On one hand, it was nice to talk to her again. On the other hand… What the hell?

 

We were both utterly stumped by this. Neither of us could come up with an explanation or a solution. She offered to try and ask the super to come do something. I told her she could TRY.

 

Eventually we settled back down and accepted the situation.

 

“Well… Shit, I guess you’re here to stay.” She said.

 

“I guess I am.” I couldn’t tell if she was happy about this or annoyed. I couldn’t quite tell if I was either.

 

“Alright… I hope you like ABBA then.”

 

I hated ABBA. This was a nightmare.

 

We resumed our routine from the days before. It remained mildly inconvenient, while also being oddly comforting. That night we talked more, sat in the same spots on the floor as the night before. I don’t know why we chose to sit on the floor when both of our beds were right there, but it felt right. The discoloration of the new patch of paint on the wall marked the talking spot perfectly, and it felt a bit nostalgic. It’s not often you sit on the floor as an adult.

 

With all the excess noise being drowned out, it felt like she was even closer. I could literally hear her breathing. We talked a little bit about our upbringings, and we aren’t terribly different. Her dad sucked, my dad died. We all got fucked up somehow. The good news is, she informed me that I don’t snore loudly at night which is a huge relief.

 

I laid up in bed, after she had said goodnight. I still hadn’t acclimated to the silence, and now I had to bear it if I wanted to sleep. It wasn’t working. I was just awake with my thoughts, which is a place I usually hate being, but not so much tonight.

 

I thought about Jane, and I thought about the weirdness of this situation. As odd as it all was, it was at least interesting. By far the most interesting thing to happen to me since I moved here. I began having those middle of the night urges to google the principles of sound waves and how they travel. Or how often apartments are vacant for long periods of time. But I resisted, determined that if I laid here unmoving in the dark long enough, sleep would happen.

 

Briefly piercing the silence, I heard a mattress creak a few times and blankets shift. It sounded like she rolled over. Then back to nothing.

 

I checked the clock. 2 am. Maybe sleep was hopeless. I stared into the dark of my apartment so long I started seeing abstract shapes and folds fade in and out of the shadows and the walls seemed to wobble, as they are want to do. I was so tired.

 

I began to fade but then another mattress creak brought me back to lucidity. This one was different. It was a deeper creak, and singular, like one fluid motion. She sat up.

 

Without question, that was the sound... But that was the only sound. No creaks, no fidgeting, no swiping sounds of blankets moving while she slowly awoke. It was strange and abrupt. It could be that she had a nightmare, but there was no heavy breathing or gasping or any of that.

 

I waited to hear another sound, but it didn’t come. A half hour passed. I didn’t hear her get out of bed, I didn’t hear her lay back down. Was she just… sitting? My mind began to paint of picture of a woman sitting still in bed in the pitch black darkness and it unnerved me.

 

Maybe she did lay back down, just slowly and softly enough that I didn’t hear it, I thought. Maybe she had her book or something - she said she was reading the other day. Maybe she never sat up at all, and I mistook that sound for something else.

 

I didn’t hear anything else that night, and about an hour later I managed to get some sleep.

 

I wondered if I could bring this up to her. Would it be weird? Eventually I decided against it. I don’t want her thinking about me listening to her sleep. The situation is already a bit uncomfortable as it is when it comes to privacy. Plus, it was probably nothing.

 

The next night I got home and double knocked on the wall. She double knocked back. This was our new normal.

 

“Hey, never date a tennis player. You know why?” She said.

 

“Why’s that?” I responded through my grin as I dealt with the water bucket once again.

 

“Love means nothing to them.” She made sure to sound extra dramatic.

 

“That’s – wow. That’s tremendous.” I responded, bemused.

 

“I’m gonna hit you with one of those every day, I decided.” She said emphatically.

 

“Oh god.” I pretended to sound annoyed.

 

“That’s right. This is why I don’t have a boyfriend. They all run away. But you can’t run away.”

 

“I can move away.”

 

“No you can’t, you’re broke as shit just like me. If you could have, you would have by now.” She had a point.

 

“So deal with it. Here: what do you call a beehive with no exit?” She continued.

 

“No. No more. This is harassment. I weep for your future husband... When you bring a man over, I’m going to shout at him to run as fast as he can. I will just scream bloody murder until he leaves.”

 

“Un-BEE-LEAVE-able.”

 

“God damn it. I like that one.” I replied, I couldn’t lie.

 

“Also I’m never bringing a man over here, are you kidding? You hear enough as it is.” Again, she had a point.

 

We went about our business, and later that night we talked a bit more. These floor chats before bed we’d started having had become a highlight of my day and I began looking forward to them while I was at work.

 

A part of my brain was trying to recontextualize this into a romantic thing, but it really wasn’t that, and I didn’t want it to be. At least not right now. It was just… nice. It was nice having someone to talk to, who was easy to talk to, who made me laugh, and who I felt comfortable with. It was nice to feel genuinely connected to somebody after feeling disconnected for so long. It was nice to have a friend.

 

“Can I ask you something?” I inquired.

 

“Yeah.” She answered without hesitation.

 

“Why did you trust me, so early on?” I had this question for a while but I felt comfortable enough now to ask.

 

Jane paused for a moment before responding, “What makes you think I trusted you?”

 

I was a bit taken aback by her question. “Oh. Well, you were just so friendly and… open. I was just wondering… This is a seedy place and you don’t know me…”

 

She cut me off “I was friendly, yeah, but that’s… That’s how you have to be. That’s like ‘customer service voice’. I don’t want to anger the strange man living next to me, you know?”

 

That made a lot of sense, I didn’t think of it that way.

 

She continued, “But I trust you now.”

 

“Yeah?”

 

“Yeah. I think you’re a good guy. I think you probably won’t kill me… What about me, do you trust me?”

 

“I mean… I’m still not 100% convinced you exist to be honest. I’ve still never seen you. You didn’t answer your door when I tried to say hi so… You might just be a figment of my imagination. Who’s to say?” I joked, but a part of me thought that would actually explain things.

 

“Wait when was this?” She sounded surprised.

 

“Oh, after we put up the sound proofing. I was gonna say hi when I got home from work, but you didn’t answer.”

 

“Really? Damn. I didn’t hear you.” She responded, sounding legitimately disappointed.

 

“Well that’s a first.” I joked.

 

Jane chuckled, “I know, right?”

 

I sighed, “Alright I gotta try to get some sleep tonight. Last night was fucking awful.”

 

“Yeah? I slept like a baby last night, these soundproofing things rule.”

 

…She slept like a baby? The image in my head of her sitting up in her bed replayed and gave me chills once again. Clearly, I must be mistaken. I shook off the thought.

 

“Well I still need to get used to it… Goodnight Jane.”

 

“Hear you later, Leigh.” That corny son of a bitch. She was serious about doing those jokes every day, wasn’t she?

 

I heard her get up and make her way to bed. A few minutes later and her side fell quiet. I crawled into my bed and I once again stared into the dark. Sleep still wasn’t coming easy. I dreaded this, but this time it only took about an hour to fall asleep, of which I was grateful. The silence still unsettled me.

 

Suddenly I awoke, still in the darkness – even deeper now. I don’t know what woke me up, but when I checked the clock, it was 2 am. I wasn’t happy. I tried to fall back to sleep, and it was slowly working until… I heard it again. That same deep bed creak. That unmistakeable sound of someone sitting up. Now I was fully awake.

 

Minutes past and I heard nothing else. Same as before. Like she was just… sitting there. This time however, I just had to know. I was confused, concerned, and pretty creeped out. So I just leaned close to the wall and whispered:

 

“Jane?”

 

Nothing happened at first. But then I heard the bed very slowly begin to creak again. Agonizingly slow and subtle. It sounded like she was… turning. Or at least adjusting her position in some way. I heard what sounded like her hands touching the wall, splayed out far apart on either side of me and then… I heard her breathing.

 

I could only hear her breathe before when we were sitting back-to-back against the wall, so she must have been pressed right up against it. Her breathing sounded different this time, though. It sounded hollow, like she had a cold. I was petrified. The hair on the back of my neck was standing on end. What was she doing? Was she even awake? What must she look like right now?

 

I just stared at the wall. Imagining her on the other side, pressed up against it like some feral thing. Was this really happening? Am I just too tired and loopy to be able to tell? Maybe the creaking was her laying back down and she’s just breathing heavier than normal because she’s asleep. I wanted to rationalize this so badly.

 

I waited for something else to happen, some other sound… I waited hours… But nothing did, and I was too scared to say anything else. Was she still there? Was she pressed against the wall all night long? I tried to get a little bit of sleep. I managed maybe 45 minutes but it was not pleasant.

 

I couldn’t focus on work the next day. I was tired, and I was so creeped out by what happened. I couldn’t think of an explanation. But I knew there had to be one. There had to be something. I couldn’t get the image out of my head, and every time that image replayed, she looked a little bit less human. I pictured her smiling a grotesque toothy grin. I imagined her drooling, her eyes open as wide as saucers, her fingers long and bony caressing the wall. None of this was rooted in reality, I knew that, but I couldn’t help but think of it.

 

I got back home and this time I hesitated before doing my customary knocks on the wall, but I did, and she returned them - same as always.

 

“I was just thinking… Mankind has made a lot of great inventions.”

 

“Jane...”

 

“But the dry-erase board has to be the most remarkable.”

 

I laughed. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to laugh at her jokes today, but I did. She’s still Jane. At least she seems to be. I was way overthinking.

 

“That one’s pretty good, I can’t lie.”

 

“You like it?” She asked, sounding proud of herself.

 

“I do... Hey I have to ask you something though.” I said, trying to remain at least somewhat casual.

 

“Shoot.”

 

“Do you… Sleepwalk?”

 

The other side went silent for a minute. “Um. No… Never in my life.” She responded, instantly sounding unnerved.

 

I fell silent too… I didn’t know how to explain. But she continued.

 

“That’s a scary ass question to ask out of nowhere. Did you hear something?”

 

“I heard… I don’t know exactly what I heard.”

 

“Stop. Don’t talk like that. Is this revenge for the corny jokes? I’ll stop the corny jokes. Don’t do this to me.” She pleaded in a half-joking manner.

 

“No, I promise I’m not messing with you - and it’s probably nothing. It’s just… You didn’t get up at all last night? Or the night before?”

 

“No, I did not get up at all. Please tell me what you heard.” She said firmly.

 

I told Jane everything that happened. I tried to be delicate, but also honest. I trusted that she didn’t know what was going on. That became evident to me by how freaked out she seemed. I know it sounded crazy, I just hope she didn’t think I was messing with her. It was difficult to tell from her tone.

 

Initially she wanted to debunk it all, saying that I must have heard something else – which I admitted could very well be true. Nevertheless, she told me she was going to stay with her sister for the night. Probably a good idea. She gave me her phone number and told me to call if anything happened. That put my mind at ease about whether or not she trusted me.

 

I told her to be safe, and she tried once again to reassure me that it was probably nothing, but I felt a sense of immense dread as soon as she left. Suddenly I really didn’t want to be alone here.

 

That night was the quietest of my life, and not in a good way. I thought about drowning it out by putting on some music or a movie, but nothing felt right.

 

I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to sleep that night, but eventually I managed. I ended up having a dream about a woman wearing a veil. through the veil I could vaguely make out three large black holes where her eyes and mouth should be. I couldn’t recall anything that happened in the dream… Only the image of that woman. I wondered if that was my subconscious way of trying to visualize Jane. I still didn’t know what she actually looked like so maybe my brain had trouble coming up with distinct features for her. Or maybe it was something else entirely.

 

It was still dark when I awoke from the dream. I felt a deep unease as I checked the time. 2 am, again. This time I wasn’t eager to fall back to sleep. I didn’t want to see the veiled woman again, so I stayed up a little while longer, attempting to ease my mind. I thought of every possible way to reassure myself. Eventually I began to fall into a façade of comfort, until…

 

Creak.

 

I went ice cold. No. This can’t be. I didn’t just hear that.

 

It was that same “sitting up” creak. But I heard Jane leave. Could she have come back late while I was sleeping? Maybe. But what if it isn’t her?

 

What if it was never her?

 

My mind raced. So many improbable scenarios played out in my mind. None of them were good. Was someone else in there with her the whole time and she didn’t know? Someone hiding away, only coming out when she’s sleeping? Was that creak her sitting up, or someone else sitting down? Do they watch her sleep?

 

All I knew for sure was that someone was on the other side of this wall. Because I could hear them breathing again.

 

I wanted to do something. I wanted to know for sure. But I was powerless. Calling out to it last time was the most horrific mistake of my life, I didn’t want to try that again. I wanted to call Jane but I was afraid of making a sound. Instead I just waited, and listened.

 

I was in a petrified daze. Hyperalert but also completely exhausted. My body wanted to shut down but my brain wouldn’t let me. It may have been minutes, or it may have been hours, I couldn’t tell. The image of the veiled woman kept reappearing in the back of my subconscious.

 

Eventually I decided to call Jane. If I heard a phone ring on the other side, then I would know. I typed the number in and hit call…

 

“The number you are trying to reach is not in service.” What? How could that be?

 

Suddenly, cutting through the silence was a sound I had become very familiar with, and yet was the one sound I was the least prepared for.

 

Knock Knock.

I'm from Lebanon. Our country is ferociously unstable but through it all, because my family was more on the privileged side, we had a good run between 1993 to 2020, the year I got married and not even 1 month later the August blast happened and Beirut was never the same again. (Google it if you haven't heard of it)

One year after that we moved to Istanbul because lebanon became unlivable. No power, no internet, no meds, no fuel. Not what we grew up with. Unlivable. 

We applied to immigration to Canada and lived in Istanbul waiting for covid to re-open things up.
2 years later the paperwork goes through 
We land in Toronto, Canada September 2023.
I find a job immediately. Husband struggles for a year with no job. We live on one income in a barely furnished 1 bedroom apartment.
He finally lands something now. October 2024. We're over the moon. One small catch.

It's in Calgary, Alberta. 

I'd be moving for the 3rd time in 4 years. 
I'm 31.. we've been married 5 years almost. 
I want babies. I want stability. I'm tired of the logistics.

Here I am now contemplating if we sell the bed, or ship it and where would the other person sleep, and if we keep the vacuum cleaner and wondering if I can find a box to safely ship the airfryer and thanking my past self for being a hoarder and keeping the coffee machine's package so we could transport it safely.
Here i am looking at the Alberta job market for my field and praying my employer lets me work remotely even though we have a strict-ish work from the office policy. 

I don't know if Calgary is end game for us. 
I don't know if i'm ready to do this again after Alberta. I never moved as a child it used to bother me when we had to go to the mountain house in the summer... Nothing feels like home anymore.

I know i'm extremely privileged to even be here... But it hasn't been easy. We both lived on 1 paycheck this whole time. It was pretty paycheck to paycheck unless we purposely changed our outings and eating habits to save. We're going to spend everything we saved for this move. We have first and last + some starting costs and we're not starting from where we were when we landed in Toronto. We had saved up so much for Canada, but now that we're here tbe biggest culture shock is how little you can save when your rent is more than 50% your monthly income.

His new job is good. I'm genuinely so glad he found it.
We agreed that I won't move right away just so he gets settled in first and I don't uproot my life here...besides I have so many pending projects at my current job which I love, it would be too hard to just up and go. 

I'm just anxious. 
And he's not talking about the move enough it's making me more anxious that his start date is November 25th and he hasnt even checked rent prices or looked at areas to live in or booked his plane ticket etc.
That always used to be my task because I worked only a part time job when we were in Istanbul but i'm really busy with my current job right now and i don't wanna tell him what to do. 
He's also not thinking about our furniture or the logsitics of moving, he's not thinking about having a farewell for our friends at all... 
I'm trying to regulate myself. 
I hope this post helps me regulate. ",1,1730395556.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

I've tried and failed multiple times to get into Factorio. I never even finished the last tutorial level. The furthest I ever made it prior was Green science.

I sat down and decided to give the game a real try these past few days, and it finally clicked for me. I don't know what happened but I understand why it's called Cracktorio now.

I've been staying up until ungodly hours of the morning. I far surpassed green science, and am now working on purple science. Working my way through everything without any guides. Chemical science was fun.

I'm having a hard time finding pieces to decorate my living room with and would love this community's thoughts and ideas. I think upgrading the coffee table to be larger/lighter wood and have larger legs will help. I'd also like to replace the chair with two chairs but unsure of the color/style. I think the painting is too small for the space, so I'd like to find something that spans horizontally more. And replace the light with some sort of lantern. Any other suggestions or advice?

1ggjvd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ggjvd8/how_do_you_resist_the_splurge/,How do you resist the splurge?,"A couple of years ago I started with coffee. I tend to be very obsessive when I pick up any new hobby so naturally I spend way too much money and ended up buying a Peugeot grinder with one of these moving burrs. Not long after that I realized that I made a mistake and instantly bought a comandante C40. I had a tough time explaining it to my girlfriend at the time. I quickly moved through all the brewing methods: aeropress, V60, moka pot, chemex, moccamaster, brevile smart grinder and the list goes on. 

Fast forward a bit, a break up happened and I stopped consuming coffee altogether for a good year. My ex gave me the fully automatic we owned after she moved in with her new boyfriend. I started using that and naturally I hated it. It broke down on me and a couple of days later I ran into a coffee nerd. I told him that I wanted to buy a sage barista touch and he quickly got me into the idea that I'd appreciate a machine like the flair 58 way more. He wss right, he demonstrated how it worked and I was sold. I said I'd save for it. 

A bit later I found about the cafelat robot. I also saw a Kinu M47 simplicity with pourover burr and magnetic cup on sale, I bought both. A week later my hario buono kettle was left on the fire and even though it was fixable with citric acid, I instantly ordered a stagg EKG Pro. I bought an espresso scale and just a few days ago, after owning that scale for 2 months, I bought a another scale (this time with smart features) + espresso monitor/gauge for my robot. This all happened within the span of 3 months. 

I am currently thinking about buying a flair, a quick mill espresso machine and a DF64v2. I heard the Real Sprometheus saying in a video: ""no reasonable person would want to have both the robot and the flair 58"".

I figured I received such good advice last time I posted here (gift for barista) that I'd come back. Thanks again to everyone who provided input last time.

With the help/guidance of the barista, I just purchased a Superautomatic (Jura Giga 10) for my home. It will be delivered tomorrow and she's going to come over on Saturday to help me set it up and get her dialed in.

I'm curious, what type of water are you guys using in your coffee houses? I was planning on using reverse osmosis (RO) as that's what I've always used; she tells me the majority of the businesses she's worked in have used RO. However, in my research, I see warnings not to use RO water, which can damage your equipment.

I'm confident the equipment used in a coffee house is far more expensive than the machine I purchased. Would they really be using water that could damage the machine?

Also, I'm reading about using mineral drops to remineralize RO water with the good minerals the RO has removed. This is recommended for flavor. I'll pick up a bottle of drops, try this method, and see if it makes a difference. Would this negate the damaging effects of RO water?

What type of water are you guys using in your shops? And, is there any truth to the RO damaging your equipment?

Thanks in advance for your input.

A few months ago, I posted about starting my journey with online dating apps. I focused on two main strategies:

1. **Profile Optimization**: I used AI to create more interesting background photos (using dreambooth). Some might see this as disingenuous, but my goal was simply to get a chance to meet in person. The photos were authentic representations of me, and no one I met felt misled.
2. **Communication Strategy**: I read a couple of books, including ""How to Have Impossible Conversations"" and ""The Scout Mindset."" I started conversations by asking about interesting things they had done recently, listening actively, and asking follow-up questions. After a few good exchanges, I’d suggest meeting for coffee or a walk. If the date went well, I’d ask for their number.

To my surprise, I ended up having quite a few dates—about 10 different women in two months, some more than once. I got intimate with two of them, but only after 4-5 dates. One of them shares my interests and personality, and we’re now exclusively dating. It feels amazing to spend time with someone who genuinely wants to be with you.

Reflecting on my experience, I’ve realized a few things:

1. **Perception of Attractiveness:** I might not be as unattractive as I thought. I’ve been called ugly in the past, so this newfound interest has been a bit surreal. At least, it seems that I look decent to some women.
2. **My Situation:** I have a decent life—6-figure job, car, rent a decent appartment, gym—which may have helped.
3. **Luck vs. Hard Work:** Much of what I experienced felt like pure luck. Confidence and grooming advice often sound great, but I never followed it. Just being clean and wearing well-fitted clothes was enough. Trying more often increases your chances of luck, but it’s still tougher if you have disadvantages (ugly, autism, ...).
4. **Expressing Frustration:** Some believe complaining here isn’t helpful, but for me, sharing and reading others' experiences helped release negativity. Don't let anyone tell you that expressing your struggles is harmful.

Because of these insights, I can't offer a guaranteed path to success. Or any generally applicable advice. My journey was unexpected, and I'm still processing this change. It feels almost like an identity crisis – going from a lifetime of loneliness to finding a meaningful connection.",2,1730395090.0,ForeverAlone,3,0.67,False

I’m Sasha, and this is my first post here. Recently, I decided to start sharing my stories and thoughts online. So here’s my first story — about how one decision (almost random) put my life on a whole new path!

Picture this: an ordinary day, I’m sipping my coffee and scrolling through social media. I see a post about a program that lets volunteers go abroad, work, and live in a new place for a whole year. I thought about it for a while but still can’t explain why I ended up applying — maybe it just sounded a bit crazy.

At the time, I had no idea I’d end up in a foreign country, meeting new people, and learning things that would totally change my life! And, the best part is that this decision led to many other unexpected changes that I’d love to share with you.

Would you be interested in hearing more about my experience? Or maybe some of you have also made such spontaneous decisions? I’d love to read your stories and thoughts!

Quinn, my beautiful dumb child, house bands are supposed to play in the house. You have six rooms in your restaurant. They can play in any of them. If waterside music is a must, they can play by the pool. 

And honestly? I’m not sure you need a house band, just like your restaurant didn’t need a gym and didn’t need a Ferris wheel and jet skis. You do not have very many customers. I’m convinced that Norman’s wife has Alzheimer’s and that’s why she keeps ordering scuba gear. Nobody could possibly lose that many life vests and oxygen tanks in a week. What are you gonna do if she gets put in a home or if Norman starts looking more carefully at their finances and realizes it’s all going to scuba gear from the local coffee shop? Best case scenario, you lose like a quarter of your income. There’s a decent chance Norman flat tries to murder you for this and you’ll be forced to merge his hands together. And then you’re down another customer! You’ll only have like four left and one of them literally owns her own coffee shop. You better hope Mark and Sam don’t go through a bad breakup because he’s not gonna come here any more if his ex is running the house band.

1ggjen9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ggjen9/feeling_completely_abandoned_by_my_friends_after/,feeling completely abandoned by my friends after my dad died,"hi everyone. the title of this post pretty much sums it all up. this is mostly a vent and me feeling sorry for myself, but I would appreciate any kind of wisdom from people who have found themselves in a similar situation. 

I lost my dad to cancer in March, just shy of 2 years after his diagnosis. during his sickness, I didn’t feel very supported by my friends - I’m only 26, and none of my friends could relate to what I was dealing with, but I did what I could to allow them the grace of ‘not knowing what to say/do’, even if I did hold some bitterness about the fact that it seemed none of them could be bothered to even ask. any plans we did make to hang out were always initiated by me, and it was only then that I might be asked ‘by the way, how’s your dad?’ - to which I would immediately downplay the severity of the situation, so as not to ruin anyone else’s mood, even after his diagnosis became terminal. 

after he died, I got the expected flood of messages of condolences and let-me-know-if-you-need-anythings. two of them came to his funeral, which I was very thankful for on the day - but now, months after, it feels like everyone else has moved on, and I’ve been left to sit in my grief alone.

I moved back home last month, partly because I was feeling so isolated where I was, and I wanted to come back into my mum’s nest and be with my family for a while. I told this same group of friends that I was moving back to our hometown (where most of us still live within 20 minutes of each other) so it’s not like it was a surprise to anyone. well, in that time, I have seen *one* of these friends for a cinema trip, that I again initiated the plans for myself. 

it’s now halloween and I have no plans for celebrating. I see these friends going to parties and otherwise enjoying the season, and I feel like this is a greater feeling than FOMO that I’m experiencing. it would have been nice if someone, anyone, could have invited me to one of these parties, or to get a coffee or go for a walk, literally anything - but no. I’ve not even received a ‘how are you doing?’ message from any of these people since the immediate wake of my dad’s death. the whole thing makes me feel so sad to think about, to be honest. I feel like my grief is some kind of burden to anyone who knows me, and I have no other option but to repress it for the sake of not somehow ‘inconveniencing’ others or making them feel uncomfortable. 

not to get too deep about it, but throughout my life I have always felt like one of those people who puts a lot more into their relationships than they get in return, like I’m a crowd filler that people keep around for their own convenience, and that nobody values my friendship as much as I do theirs. it really sucks that these last few months (hell, this last year or two by now) have pretty much confirmed this to be true. I suppose some people might ask ‘why don’t you message them first?’ - but at this point, I don’t want to do that anymore. I’ve always been the one to message first, and I simply don’t have the energy to keep being that person anymore, and to beg for the bare minimum from people who I thought cared about me more than this. I can’t be bothered to try anymore. 

I have several friends in other cities and countries that I feel this same sense of neglect from, but I suppose I’m a bit more inclined to accept that, given the physical distance between us. it hurts even more that these hometown friends, who I grew up and went to school with, seem to have forgotten about me completely. my mum has picked up on this as well - last week she made a joke about how I seem to be turning into a recluse, because I never go out to see anyone, and that really stung. this has truly been the loneliest year of my life, in every way, shape and form. 

I just don’t know how to move forward from this. I’ve been in therapy for the last 2 years, and this insecurity about my relationships is something that’s come up before, but I think I’m going to have to talk about it in greater depth when I see my therapist this week, because it’s been weighing especially heavy on my mind recently. 

I suppose my plea to the reddit void is this: I know this isn’t a unique experience, but how do I get past this feeling? is it really a case of focusing on myself and my grief over these next few months, and trying to ignore the pangs of sadness I feel every time I go on social media or see a group of friends out and about?

But deep down, there's a wild side of you that's been repressed—collared, chained, and caged by the expectations and norms you were raised with. This inner conflict drives you crazy because of the hypocrisy you see.

You can't let this side of you out due to a fear of judgment or vulnerability.

You have a choice: stay in your current role, which is fine, or unleash yourself.

I'm here to help you explore those urges discreetly and without judgment. This might be your chance to let loose and be as daring as you want. When we’re done, you can return to your normal life with a secret grin that no one needs to understand—until you want to do it again.

Here's a general idea about me: 5'7"", moreno with a dad bod (yeah, yeah I'm working on it and working out), I look young for my age with a cool and hip personality. From one of the top 4 (Blue if it matters). During the day, I am a suit/barong wearing, coffee drinking motivational speaker and life coach. At night, the work clothes come off and I am equally comfy with jeans/shots, plain tees and a light beer. Anyway, travel because of work caused my separation and we settled the incident as mature adults, we are still friends to date. Details details details? Let's leave some things for convos in bed.

1ggj927,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ggj927/should_i_leave/,should i leave? ,"throwaway account because i’m too scared to post on my main. i apologize in advance because this will probably be a long post, but i would really appreciate the advice or stories from people with similar experiences. 

i (F23) have been with my partner (M27) for 4.5 years. We currently live together (renting) and have two dogs. I have been experiencing thoughts of doubt for a long time and have just started to become aware of the cycle. For a while I will have doubts, we’ll argue & end up reconciling, & then doubts go away. until they creep back in. so here goes. 

i have felt for a long time that my partner is essentially a dependent. i do all the cooking (he claims he can’t cook ANYTHING given he undercooked chicken 2 years ago & got food poisoning… i think i should add we do have a meat thermometer), majority of cleaning, daily housework, 99% of the laundry is done by me, & i am sole caretaker of our dogs (he might take them potty once or twice every few days but it’s primarily always me feeding them, bathing them, stimulating them, scheduling vet appts, etc.). i also do all of the grocery shopping, meal planning, & keep track of all of our bills. we split bills 50/50, but i often find myself spending more than him on groceries. 

now i want to kind of start of by saying it’s not that i necessarily mind doing those things; i enjoy cooking (it’s a hobby of mine) & not to toot my own horn but im fairly good at it. i like cleaning a lot because it’s a great way to decrease my anxiety. however it’s started to bother me a lot recently because he just doesn’t take initiative to do anything. he will pile trash on top of the trash can to the point it’s overflowing on the floor, doesn’t cook (will literally complain about being hungry for 2+ hours and ask me what i plan on making), doesn’t take initiative to go to the grocery when we’re low on coffee, coffee creamer, etc (for example there have been times he will use the rest of the creamer & just not tell me, so when i go to make a cup of coffee i’m disappointed to find there’s no creamer), lets laundry pile up & overflow, doesn’t pick up dog poop when he DOES take the dogs out (there is literally a separate document we signed that states we must clean up after them or else we could face a fine/eviction), doesn’t do dishes even if i spend 1+ hours making our meals, doesn’t know when bills are do, leaves his trash or dirty dishes in various places, leaves shoes & dirty clothes in the middle of the floor, basically the list could go on. i will note that he has ADHD & executive dysfunction has always been a struggle for him. he is medicated but i don’t think this can all be blamed on ADHD. 

the real kicker here is that i work three fucking jobs: i’m an intern working 20 hours a week, a full time grad student taking classes 12 hours a week, & i also have a part time job at a coffee shop where i work an additional 20 hours a week. not to mention tacking on homework, projects, exams, papers, documentation for my internship, & preparing for my licensure exams when i am at home. he works a varied schedule, where one week he works 60 hours, at work 5 days a week, then the next week he works 24 hours, at work 2 days a week. he works overnights so he is usually up between 2pm - 6am, even on his days off. he’s graduated college & doesn’t have obligations outside of work or scheduled quarterly trainings. 

i would like to add i’ve had multiple conversations with him. each time it always ends in a huge fight. he is so verbally aggressive when he’s angry, often telling me that i’m lying & he does more than i claim (which i am being so fucking for real he doesn’t. i will die on that hill), i don’t appreciate him, he shouldn’t have to change his whole life for me, we work different schedules, calls me names, etc. these fights typically go on for several days until he ultimately tells me how very sorry he is & how he will be so much better. it’s been like this since we moved in together in 2022. 

i am not going to lie in this post, i am so fucking depressed and overwhelmed. there is so much chaos in my life right now between work and school and my internship and then being the manager of the house that i just literally want to run away & never speak to anyone again. i am so burnt out, i am rageful half the time, & i am SO bitter. 

i know that within all of this it’s probably self explanatory: duh, leave. i have so much awareness regarding this situation; i deserve better, i dont want this forever, someone will give me what im looking for & more without me having to ask, he’s taking advantage of me, i know it all. but how do i leave? i am so broke due to being a grad student, i can’t afford to break my lease & live on my own, my parents are 2+ hours away & i have to be at my internship 5 days a week, and we have 2 dogs together that i know he will fight me on despite not taking care of them. i just don’t know what to do. i feel so hopeless, as if this is just the life i’m destined to have. not the victim mentality of woah is me but just like “how can i even get out of this?” 

i feel like the only time i notice him doing “more” is when he wants to have sex. like this was my breaking point: monday he did the dishes, had sex with me, sat down & played xbox for the rest of the night. didn’t tell me goodnight or anything. hasn’t touched anything in the house since. that’s when i really just sat back & realized, wow, there’s no way this dude actually gives a single fuck about me. he just likes that he gets a home cooked meal every night, always has clean laundry, never has to lift a finger, & gets laid. & it just made me feel so objectified and worthless. 

he’s never told me that he *expects* these things out of me, or that he views it as my “role” but that’s how i feel at this point. and i just need some words of encouragement, harsh truth, or just some advice. if you read this far, thank you. ",3,1730393648.0,Advice,3,1.0,False
1ggj8zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovingToLosAngeles/comments/1ggj8zd/moving_to_la_neighborhoods_to_check_out/,Moving to LA - Neighborhoods to check out?,"hi all redditors of LA, seeking some advice about neighborhoods for an upcoming move. 

TLDR: Looking for eastside and westside recommendations of walkable neighborhoods for a couple with a dog in their late 20's.

I (29/F) and my boyfriend (29/M) are moving to LA next year, and we're starting to think about neighborhoods that we would want to check out since we have a few trips coming up to scope some areas out and would love some insight. I've read tons of posts on here, but it's definitely overwhelming so was hoping I could ask the experts.

**work**: I work remotely, but my partner will most likely be commuting every day - nothing is set in stone yet, but he'll likely be in central, DTLA, or century city based on his industry. We'll cross the bridge of narrowing down neighborhoods once we have a better idea of his commute.

**neighborhood wants**: We'll be getting 1 car between both of us, but since i work remote and he'll be in office most days, its really really important that we're in a walkable area. Ideally, we would be within walking distance to some sort of ""main street""/area where we can grab coffee, dinner, drinks, shop, etc. My absolute dream would be to live close to a farmers market since I am very into cooking.

**lifestyle**: we're a mix between homebodies and social. I love going out for dinner + drinks, and trying new restaurants. We also like going out with friends, but keep it pretty casual. He likes having access to outdoor space for hiking or sports. We have a dog, so also being in a walkable area with parks, or having access to trails on the weekend is ideal.

**Additional context:** I've only lived on the east coast in walkable cities \[currently NYC, previously Philly\], and I haven't had a car in many years, so this will be a huge change. I gravitate towards more residential-y areas that still have a bit of an artsy/eclectic feel to them. My boyfriend was born and raised in LA but hasn't lived there as an adult, so while this is definitely a homecoming for him (and likely a more permanent move for us), there are still some neighborhoods that he/we haven't explored.

We have a few friends in LA right now in BH and Venice, and his family is in Pasadena. From what I've seen, I like the vibe of the east side like the Los Feliz, silverlake, echo park area, but I'm afraid it could be too isolating considering where our friends live, but my concern with being close to the beach is being far from his family. We have a decent budget - probably up to $4500 \[max\] for ideally a 2 bed, maybe with a little outdoor space. It's clear that this unicorn apartment I've made up in my head probably doesn't exist because something has to give, so i would love everyone's perspective! Thank you!!!

**Check-in:**
The check-in experience was awful. I used the two FNA for the stay. They didn't bother to check my reservations and link the two nights together. I had to remind the check-in person. Also, no mention of my globalist status which was not a big deal most of the time.

However, they didn't walk me through the globalist amenities or perks during the check-in process. I assumed there is going to be a sheet of paper in the room that explain the perks that so I let it go. When I went into my room, there was no sheet explaining globalist benefits.

I also had to ask if the check-in process was done as the person just went back to typing on the computer without any indication that the check-in process was finished. It was just an odd interaction. 

Once I figured it out where the Club was located, I tried to use my card to get to that floor. To my surprise, I wasn't able to. The check-in person didn't give me club access. Luckily, another person in the elevator helped me out with the floor. Once I got to the club, the club manager was able to reprogram my card to give me the correct access.

So far, these were just small hiccups in my opinion. Nothing to get too mad about. These things happen. 

**Room**

The room had beautiful view of Pudong and the river. However, that was the only positive. The room feels really dated. The TV had analog signal and they lied about having coffee maker in the room. There was only a water kettle and nestle instant coffee packs. I stayed at Urcove Jingan and even they had nepresso machine in each room. How does a Grand Hyatt not even have that? The walk-in shower was also the smallest I have ever seen. Very cramped and lots protruding metal bars in there that make it easy to bump your elbow into one when showering. 

**Check-out**

The worst experience was during checkout. To my surprise, the checkout person presented a invoice/bill for two nights stay. I told the person I used two FNA for my stay so why was there a invoice? I had to pull out my Hyatt app on my phone to show them I used the FNA for the stay. After some typing and clicking around, they canceled the invoice. They didn't even apologize for the mistake.

Probably my last time staying at Grand Hyatt Shanghai. It was a waste of FNA to be honest. I had much better experience at UrCove Jingan that was a lot cheaper. 

**TL;DR:**

- Didn't get club access as globalist.
- Room was dated and no coffee machine.
- Asked to pay when I used FNA. Didn't even apologize for the mistake.",0,1730393402.0,hyatt,9,0.44,False

So, I've (25 f) had near debilitating back + hip/leg pain for over a decade. It has gotten progressively worse, and starting about 2 years ago, I had to start wearing Depends due to newly developing urinary incontinence issues. I was miserable, so, I went to my doctor to try and get help. 

My appointment was for chronic pain & sudden incontinence - what I was *given* by my **doctor**, was a 4 paragraph long schpiel about how OBESE I was. 
He told me to watch *SuperSize Me*, *Fed Up*, and *That Sugar Film*.
He told me to read the books *Why We Get Fat*,  *Wheat Belly*, *Grain Brain*, and *Fat Chance*. 

He suggested I go to Overeaters Anonymous, and sent me an article about **intermittent fasting**. 

He wrote down that ""everyone"" needs to avoid the following:

Fast food
Food bought from gas stations
All soda
All bottled/sweetened teas
Candy
Sports Drinks
Coffee that contains ANY added sugar, syrups, chocolate, whipped cream
Juice
Cold cereal

After *all of that*, he then laid out the general, most common reasons for back pain. Before I had left the appointment, he had suggested gastric bypass surgery to me. I was 5ft 4, >!220 lbs!< , and did not (and still dont) have diabetes or any sort of serious health issue caused by weight. 

Since that visit, I have lost xx lbs purely from restrictive behaviors, and.... I just got an xray that confirmed I have mild scoliosis, lumbar spinal stenosis, and disc space narrowing at L5 s1. Now I'm getting an MRI to see if I have severe spinal issues that are causing me to lose my bladder function. 

Nothing feels real right now. I've been in pain for over 10 YEARS, but, I only was given help when my doctor made me anorexic :( 
There is so, SO MUCH wrong with the US medical system. My soul is aching, I might be disabled forever due to how long it took to discover my back issues. I just feel lost and defeated. Thank you for listening :/",6,1730393218.0,AnorexiaNervosa,1,1.0,False

1ggj1jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/theGoldenGirls/comments/1ggj1jo/halloween_episode_draft/,Halloween Episode Draft,"its always bothered me that they never did a halloween episode, it seems like an episode about Halloween would fit perfectly into the golden girls. So since ive been rewatching the show lately and it is Halloween, I thought id take a stab at a rough draft of a Halloween episode.  

Start:

The episode would start in the living room.  The house is all decorated and Dorothy is sitting on the couch (not in costume) watching TV. Rose comes out dressed as a moose and says she’s ready. “For hunting season” Dorothy responds. Rose explains that she’s is going to Miles’ to hand out candy with him and after weeks of begging she finally convinced miles to do a couples costume with her, he’s the salmon. Rose then explains a crazy st. Olaf story about the star crossed lovers of a moose and a salmon and how they ended up running/swimming away together.  Blanche comes out next dressed as a sexy black cat (just black lingerie with cat ears and whiskers painted on her face). She asks Dorothy if she’s sure she doesn’t want to go to Mel Bushman’s annual halloween party with her “its only the largest social event of the spooky season”. Dorothy declines claiming she just plans on staying home to hand out candy. Sophia then comes out dressed all in black, her and her friends missed devils night (due to bingo night being rescheduled) and are celebrating tonight. The girls leave (Blanche is picked up by her date), but Sophia asks Dorothy if she is going to be okay being home alone on Halloween as she might get scared. Dorothy says she’s not afraid of a children’s holiday. 

Rose Story: 

Rose progressively gets more upset as no kids understand her and Miles’s costume and they dont care to hear the story.  Rose reaches her breaking point when some kids call the costumes stupid. Rose becomes upset and says the kid was right, their costumes are stupid and she apologizes to Miles for making him wear the costume. Miles comforts her by saying he loves the costumes and is glad Rose convinced him. Rose cheers up until they hear multiple thuds hit the door. They open the front door to see eggs smashed on it and hear Sophia laughing in the distance. 

Blanche story: 

Blanche gets to the party and sees so many men in sexy costumes. She decides to take some abandoned masks that she finds so that she can flirt with multiple men without her date or the others finding out. We would see the chaos as she tries to balance multiple masks and men. In the end she is found out and is confronted by the men. She is embarrassed but the men say that they have no issue sharing her… Blanche is presently surprised. 

Dorothy story: 

Dorothy is at home handing out candy, and making comebacks to smart mouthed kids.  Strange things begin happening… the lights flicker on and off, the phone rings and its just a man breathing heavily “John Goodman is that you?”, when she leaves the living room and comes back she notices things have been moved.  She chocks all this up to coincidence and a prank call.  Later she’s hears footsteps in the house and thinks it is Sophia pranking her, until the phone rings and its Sophia explaining that she is going to be home late since Gladice threw her back out smashing a pumpkin and they had to take her to the after hours clinic. Just then the phone goes dead and the power goes out. Dorothy is scared and multiple figures in cloaks, masks, and carrying knives emerge. Dorothy screams and its revealed to be Sophia and her friends. Sophia claims she wanted to prove that Dorothy can get scared on halloween. 

Ending:

Rose comes home to find the house empty and a note from Dorothy on the coffee table that claims she changed her mind and went out with Sophia and her friends. Blanche then comes home and they tell each other about their nights and rose tells her about the note. They decide to sit on the couch and see if there are any good scary movies on TV. We see Dorothy and Sophia appear behind them wearing the same cloaks, masks, and knives that Sophia and her friends wore earlier. They scare rose and Blanche and laugh. 

This was my rough attempt at a halloween episode, its definitely not perfect and could be improved. Dorothy’s story is quite cliche and there are other avenues you could take Rose (I could see her trick-or-treating with some neighbourhood kids).  I could also see the girls throwing a halloween party instead and Stan shows up. ",1,1730393102.0,theGoldenGirls,3,0.57,False

*East of Phoenix City, Phoenix Free State*

Wade felt old.  He hadn’t slept much that year.  But the man sitting next to him was even older and slept even less than he did.  Sometimes Wade would wake from a restless sleep to find Jamaal still sitting at the wheel, staring into the space beyond the screens as though he could see straight through the metal and silicon and plastic, as though he had been waiting that entire time, patiently, just to be ready to start the engine as soon as Wade woke.  Now the man’s dark eyes were studying the dim outlines of the dirt track that was called a highway, his head moving in sweeps that took in the instruments and the consoles and controls, and through the screens the night around them in IR and thermal, the hills and rocks and broad expanse of cooling desert.

Sometimes Wade wanted to ask Jamaal what it was he did when everyone else was asleep, when even Wade had stretched out on a foam pad in the meager shade under the truck and the sun was crawling over the burning land with long and hungry fingers.  What it was that filled Jamaal’s mind or danced before his eyes as he sat in the heat, a silent staring statue in the empty implacable truck.  It wasn’t an easy question to ask and it would have been even harder to answer so Wade put off asking it and Jamaal died before he got around to finding out.  But if Wade had known he wouldn’t have believed it, or maybe he would have but he  would have laughed.  Such are the secrets kept from old friends.

They weren’t that old, really.  But to be in your forties or fifties in a world where most don’t survive their third decade makes you feel old.  The job was rough on the body.  And the soul.  So it was always a relief to when they finally got to the other side of the border.  But they weren’t there yet.

Wade checked the side mirror, reassuring himself that the other two trucks were behind him.  It was a long trip.  From their warehouse in east LA it was only a few hours to the Salton Sea, even in the gun trucks they used for the Texas route - military surplus, armored vehicles he’d bought for cheap at an auction.  Stripped down the armor to reduce weight, good only against 5.56, usually good against 7.62 as long as the bullets hit at some kind of angle.  Truck 3 carried a 3D printer for quick repairs and all the trucks had medichines for emergency treatment.  The only heavy armor was underneath the truck where all the processing power for the AIs sat.

They had retro-fitted the trucks with hydrogen fuel cells to comply with civilian environmental regulations.  And hidden cargo holds to avoid complying with certain other laws.  But at Slab City they turned south in the night and headed across the desert.  The cooling plates that covered the trucks and allowed them to avoid thermal detection sucked too much energy from the batteries to drive during the day – they wouldn’t have been able to run the A/C, weak as it was, at the same time as the cooling plates.  No reason to cook to death just to get there a few hours early.  Not that they would literally cook to death, he mused, because they’d done it before, but no one liked sitting in a pool of ball sweat for five days.  He re-did the math in his head: 10 hours of peak heat for four days would require an extra 40, say 50 kilograms of hydrogen per day per truck, which would mean … oh, yes, they would run out of fuel.  So instead they would creak over the desert at night and hide in the day.

They had reliable intel on border patrols courtesy of a program purchased from a a broker in Vancouver and the young lance corporal that uploaded the duty computer at 7th Marine Headquarters in exchange for a bag of Mexican tar and a simstim.  And Wade knew the right folks to bribe and the things they liked to be bribed with.  But still, it felt good to be rid of the tiny gnawing worm of anxiety and know they were in the Free State, safe from the Border Patrol, humming along the old I-10 straight towards the heart of Phoenix.  The Free State militia didn’t care what they were carrying as long as they paid the admission fee in hard crypto or clean Mexican crystal.  Drugs and crypto were the universal currencies in this new world, far better than gold due to their light weight, rapid fungibility, limited traceability, and non-zero-sum supply.

By this point in the trip they were always ready for a hot shower and a cold beer, so they pushed through the day without sleep, the cooling plates turned off and the A/C blasting lukewarm air into the truck.  Jamaal in-lining norepinephrine through his neural stent to stay awake as Wade sipped on old coffee, straining the grounds through his teeth when he got to the bottom.  The coffee was stale, the same temperature as the truck, and the grounds were on their last legs.  This cup tasted far more of the chicory and date seed blend he used to bulk up the real beans than it did of the actual coffee.  So at this point what was in his cup was mostly just dark water that tasted of industrial farming and flavoring agents with perhaps just a dash of the Ethiopian Highlands.

It was late afternoon when they finally came to the Avondale checkpoint.  The sun high in the sky, and angry, burning eye glaring down at them.  Even with sunglasses it was almost too bright.  Wade tossed the guard a quart ziploc of crystals and the man waved them through without scanning the trucks or writing anything down.  Fucker already had his pipe out by the time Truck 2 passed.

They bumped along the old I-10 to the old I-17 and got off on Buckeye.  Drove slowly down long streets as tuk-tuks zigged and zagged past old beaters that looked like they were mostly rust and duct tape.  Turned left onto 7th and two blocks later right onto Sherman.  Slowly pulled into the hard-packed sand lot at Sally’s Bed and Breakfast.  Across the street, the old train yard was like the hollowed out carcass of a dinosaur, slowly bleaching white in the desert sun.  The tents of a homeless camp stirred in the hot breeze and a hunch-backed old man poked through trash looking for something he could sell for drugs or sex.  It was a shithole of a city in many ways but the parking lot was nearly full and Sally’s had a new neon sign and the smell of tamales was already pushing its way through the road dust and hydrogen vapor.  They ook good care of their customers and the rooms were usually free of black widows and dead hookers.

Wade climbed down from the truck.  Dinesh, the owner of Sally’s, waved a greeting from behind a too-shiny window, his hand appearing disembodied behind the glare of the sun.  Jamaal was already under the truck checking fluids.  Wade bent down and tapped Jamaal’s left boot to get his attention.

“Get a room for me.  I need to go talk to a contact.”

Jamaal craned his body around to see who it was, then grinned and wiped the back of a dirty hand across his forehead.

“No problem, skipper.  Want me to order you some food?”

“Nah, it might be a little longer than that.  But first round’s on me.”

We’re 2 years in a relationship and 4mos living in together. And I am currently 10wks pregnant. I was so sure talaga na I’m gonna marry him someday but day by day napapaisip ako. My mga ugali na hindi ko na nagugustohan.

BPO Employee ang partner and ako naman is a WFH freelancer. Sa chores, napapansin ko na madalas na ako na lang yung gumagalaw and expected niya ako talaga gagawa kasi WFH lang ako. Pitiks lang din naman kasi work ko. Pero HALF kami sa lahat ng bills. Masipag naman sya, lalo na pag nag-aaway kami lol. Nagpapalaundry kami and sya naglalaba ng mga damit na hindi pwede i-laundry. Minsan ako din naman naglalaba pag tamad siya. And siya din naglilinis ng apartment tuwing day off. 

Tuwing nagkakasakit ako, wala siyang initiative like bilhan ako ng gamot o kung ano ba dapat gawin, kailangan pa sabihan. Pero pag sya nagkakasakit alam ko ano gagawin. 

My anger issues din, tuwing galit siya laging nagmumura. Hindi naman directly sakin. It’s like “tangina” and tuwing umaalma ako sinasabi niya hindi naman daw “tanginamo” sinabi niya kaya hindi ako minumura niya. Ewan ko ba ganun ba yun. Lumaki kasi akong hindi palamura yung nasa paligid.

Last week, I was sick due to pregnancy. Wala akong kain kasi wala akong gusto kainin at sinusuka ko lang din lahat. Dagdag pa yung sobrang lala ng UTI ko. Nagagalit sya kesyo ang dami daw problema. Hindi pa tapos yung isa meron nanaman na para bang ginusto ko magkasakit. Nauna pa yung galit kesa tanongin ako kung gutom ba ko alam naman niyang wala pakong kain. Galing siyang duty nito and wala pang tulog. Ending, hindi kami kumain and natulog na lang.

Ngayon namang long weekend. We decided na umuwi sa kanya kanyang tahanan (2hrs away sa city kung san kami nakatira) 2mos din siyang hindi nakauwi. Nag m-ml for hours kasi miss nya daw maglaro na walang lag, lag kasi dun sa apartment namin. Lumalabas with friends, nagkakape lang naman and tanong ako ng tanong. Like, 4hrs kang naglaro? Kanina ka pa ba nakarating jan sa coffee shop? Things like that lang naman at galit na galit. Sabi magpamiss naman daw ako at nabwebwesit sya tanong ako ng tanong. Ngayon na nga lang daw sya nakauwi panay pa tanong. Ewan ko lang talaga, baka sira lang ulo ko. Pero pag nakakasama niya talaga barkada niya at matagal kami hindi magkasama nag-iiba ugali niya. Ibang iba pag kami lagi magkasama.

BUT HERE’S THE CATCH NAMAN

He buys all the things na hilingin ko, bago sya umuwi galing work magtatanong siya ano ba gusto kong pagkain. (Picky eater ako simula nabuntis). Pag madyo matagal break nila like 2hrs, umuuwi sya dadalhan ako foods. Umuuwi agad after work. Pag my biglaang VTO sila, 5hrs early yung uwian. Umuuwi agad. Hindi sya gumagala with workmates or kung sino man. Yung sweldo, sa bills and needs namin napupunta.  Hindi siya madalas umuwi sa kanila while ako naman umuuwi samin every other week. Naiiwan lang siya dun sa apartment mag-isa. Hindi gumagala, tamang ML lang. 

Ngayon, nainis ako. Binlock ko. Nainis ako sa sinabing magpamiss naman daw at nakakainis, araw araw naman daw magkasama sa apartment bat daw ba tanong ng tanong.

Ako yata ang problema.

Just in a few words: i changed as a person finding other aspects of my personality and fixing them by improving my sleep.

It's like the world around me is different, that before i was suffering because of myself and forcing myself (sorry for the repetition) to be like the others around me.

Usual question: why can't i be like the other guys, i mean, who have the motivation to do everything? To be honest, i think that when i was at elementary school i could do many things in a day, like this ""condition"" got worse through years.

Always have been late, i need extra motivation to do something, and as i wrote, i'm tired of suffering as i did in my ""past life"". I tried to drastically change myself in the last 2 years, with some effects, but the main point is that sleeping well allowed me to almost be like normal people (sorry for the word ""normal"", but just to understand each other...).

BTW, the last 6 months were hell for me. I tried supplements, the famous Andrew H. (i can't tell his name here, like Voldemort, lol)'s sleep stack stopped working, and now i'm taking magnesium citrate and trust me, following all the annoying sleep hygiene's rules someone can have. Every night. No alcool, now removed coffee, nothing.

But when i don't sleep well, i can't function anymore. I'm 21, and when i was at high school this never happened. It's like by changing myself in these 2 years my brain requires more energy than before to do something step by step. Ex: workout, study, work...

Sorry for the long text, just wondered if i was the only one struggling with sleep.",1,1730392714.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False
1ggivp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ggivp6/my_worst_halloween_ever/,My WORST Halloween Ever!,"This is gonna be the Best Halloween Ever! Grandma went out to buy extra candy – it’s a quick jaunt, and I’m okay being left alone – she’ll be back in fifteen minutes. Twenty, tops.

Now’s my chance! I grab a chair and put it directly underneath the entrance to the attic. I stand on my tip-toes, but can’t reach, so I grab a broom and pry it open; then I jump, grab hold, and lift myself into the attic, which is way more difficult than expected. But I did it! I'm terribly excited. And nervous. What's up here? No one speaks of Grandma's attic. Ever.

Sudden darkness surprises me. I reach for my phone, and curse my stupidity. My phone is on the coffee table. I’d go back and get it, but there isn’t enough time. Plus, the chair tipped over, so getting down means jumping, which will hurt. Meh, I’ll worry about that when the time comes. First things first, time to explore.

The heat up here is tremendous, the air thick and stale; the floorboards creak as I creep around, looking for a light switch.  Something squeaks, startling me, and I fall face-first into a giant cobweb.

“Ah, crap!” I shout, which is dumb. I just swallowed a mouthful of web. Gagging and coughing, I wipe the icky stuff from my mouth.

As my eyes adjust, I get anxious. The entire attic is filled with cobwebs, and not the normal kind, these are huge and elaborate. Veiny like my grandma’s hands. I try moving, but the web holds its grip, sticking to me like superglue. Again, I reach for my non-existent phone and curse my stupidity.

“No worries,” I tell myself, near-panic, “Grandma should be home soon.”

I wait for what seems an eternity. She really should be home by now. Without my phone, I have no idea how much time has passed. It feels like hours, but probably mere minutes. Growing more and more impatient, I give it everything I’ve got, trying desperately to free myself, but I get further entangled.

“This is nuts.”

My mind turns against me. Maybe the spiderweb is alive. Maybe it’s lonely, trapped inside this attic all these years, and I’m its prisoner. It’s probably hungry. I look up and groan. Dangling above me is the scariest spider I’ve ever seen, big as a tarantula, huge and hairy and hideous. Its beady black eyes stare into mine, daring me to move, its orange-black tentacles teasing me as it scuttles about.

I hate spiders. Always have. When I was six or seven, my older sister hid one in my sandwich, and I ate it. Everyone teased and called me Spider Boy. Now this? If my bratty sister finds out, she’ll tell everyone, and I’ll be the laughing stock at school.

Again I try freeing myself, thrashing and flailing my skinny arms, but nothing works. By now, my entire body is entwined. This makes zero sense; I may be small, but still. I try again, only this time slowly and meticulously. I’ll wiggle my way free. That should work.

It doesn’t.

When is Grandma getting home? Surely, it’s been a half hour by now, but I can’t tell for sure. Not having my phone sucks. What did I do to deserve this? I mean, trapped in a spider web? Who heard of such a thing?

Something heavy lands on my head: The giant spider.

“AAAHH!”

Frantic, I swat it away.

“OUCH!”

It bit my hand. I can only hope it isn’t venomous. Without my phone, I can’t check. As I flounder about, the thing flies off and lands next to me. We have a stare-off; one I’m destined to lose.

The heat is getting to me, my armpits are soaked. I wipe my forehead, which is a mistake. I’m covered in thick, ropy web. “This sucks,” I complain. “There must be a way to free myself.”

Straight ahead is a large trunk covered in cobwebs, beside it, a busted ironing board; boxes and boxes of books line the slanted walls. On a small table in the corner is a bunch of fancy tea cups with blue patterns on them; like everything else, they’re coated in cobwebs.

Strange noises.

“On no. Please no.”

Spiders.

Crawling out of every crevasse, tap, tap, tapping their tiny toes – or whatever it is they walk on – as they go. Yuck. I hate spiders. Have I said that already? Cuz it’s really, really true. Adrenaline arrives like cavalry, giving me super powers.

“It’s now or never.”

Fists clenched, screaming like an idiot, I charge, freeing myself, and end up smashing into the table with the tea cups; cups explode, my skinny body slips and falls, and everything goes dark.

I must’ve passed out. My head hurts. My body feels like a dumb truck. Before I can open my eyes, I feel something crawling across my face.

""Oh God, no.""

My eyes snap open.

“AAAHH!”

A cluster of creepy spiders are crawling across me. And I’m snagged. The web is holding me hostage. Stupid spiderweb. I’m freaking out. The spiders are gonna eat me!  This is ridiculous. Where the hell is Grandma?

A thought arrives: Maybe she’s home!

“Help!” I shout, hoping she’ll hear me. “I’m trapped inside a spiderweb!”

Nothing.

The shrillness of my voice shocks me. So do the spiders. Like soldiers, they're preparing for battle. Tap, tap tap, they march across the dusty attic floor, attacking me. Hundreds of them, maybe more, creeping along my pant legs, crawling inside my T-shirt. I feel them in my hair. And I’m stuck! Can't move. I’m more terrified than I’ve even been in my life. I really don’t wanna touch one. I might get bit again.

Panicking, I look around, desperate to free myself. ""Aha!"" The broken tea cups! I stretch out my hand. Not the one with the bite, my other. It isn’t as strong, but beggars can’t be choosers.

My little fingers inch closer, stretching as far as humanly possible. Almost there. Soooo close. Meanwhile, the biggest spider in the world is scurrying up my arm, trying to stop me. It’s surprisingly heavy. And ugly. With tremendous effort, I snatch a shard. It’s sharp, and I don’t wanna cut myself. Using the sharp end, I slice and carve and cut the rope-like web. There’s so much of it! It's taking longer than it should.

SNAP. The final thread give way.

""I did it!"" I leap to my feet, careful not to snag myself again, then I go on a squashing spree. Phew! Killing spiders is a daunting task. Growing weary, I tiptoe towards the exit. I look down and frown; the chair is gone. I forgot.

The house shakes. The front door slams.

“Toby? You home?”

“Dad?”

Is it really him?

“Up here!” I cry.

My father’s worried-sick face greets me. Looking up, he says, “What did you get yourself into now?”

He helps me down and cleans me off, then tells me how he’s been texting for nearly an hour. Turns out, Grandma was in a car accident. She’s fine, only minor scrapes and bruises, but her car is totaled. All I can do is jabber on and on. I’m still frantic. My hand is sore, but that's the least of my worries. My father is holding something. A bag. When I see what's inside, I go into shock.

""Oh, no. Please, no.""

Is this some kind of sick joke? Must be. If so, I don’t like it. Not one bit. He hands me my costume, but I refuse to take it. No. Freakin’. Way.

“I knew you’d like it,” he says, ruffling my hair, which is still coated in cobwebs.

“I’m staying inside tonight,” I pout.

“What? Why?” The shock on his face is as real as my swollen right hand.

Then it hits me. This is no joke.

“No way I’m wearing that costume!”

My father frowns, the worry on his face worsening. A ping of guilt rips through my heart, but I’m adamant. Nothing will change my mind. Period.

“Why?” he asks, eyes pleading.

I choke up. I hate seeing him looking so sad. I gulp. This is my WORST Halloween ever!

I believe he has some underlying issues that I am not qualified to diagnose. We really do love each other, but in my opinion he is controlling and struggles with anger management, is paranoid as well. I have not been as honest as I could have been with him, and I take responsibility. I have severe anxiety and that led me to hide things that I think he would be angry about. I acknowledge he has a lot of stress but that is not my fault. 

the other day I went to a coffee shop early in the morning and put my phone to charge in an outlet there. I went to a salon next door and after I walked all the way back home (30 min walk) because my bf had my car. I realized when I got back home that I forgot my phone charging in the outlet at the coffee shop. 

After calling the place to make sure it was still there, I had to prepare food for my cat anyhow so I stayed home for a little and then left to walk back to pick up my phone. I knew my bf would be calling me by that time, since by then it was the afternoon. He texts and calls every few hours (not even sure if this is normal either to me it’s excessive). It took me an hour to retrieve my phone. It’s maybe the second time  I’ve lost my cellphone, the other time being at his house, which he was also unhappy about that time. He was livid. I told him what happened but he was already flying off the handle. 

He was very verbally aggressive, which was awful. once we got to his house he kept snarling “get the f***out of my life” a few times and also told me to get some of my stuff from the house. I should have left, ensuring my safety, but like an idiot, I followed him into the entrance and tried to reason with him. At this point, he started hurling random jackets with a lot of strength at my head. He punched a large antique grandfather clock and it reverberated with a loud sound. I had no idea how to calm him down. He was on the staircase a bit above me and took a denim jacket and swung it with intense force at me. the interior of the jacket, because it was vintage, was lined with heavy metal buttons and multiple buttons hit directly onto my eye and temple, and the side of my head. When it hit me, my vision went completely shock white, like lightning. My hearing dissipated and all I could hear was intense ringing for maybe 1-2 minutes. I thought I had a concussion. The impact was so bad I fell to the floor in pain. The side of my head immediately swelled with a large bump. I have never had injuries like this before. He did feel bad once he realized how bad the injury was. Its clear he did not mean to hit me with something sharp. 

He helped to ice my head, and the bump started to swell down, but my eyelid was totally dark purple. He seemed really worried about anyone seeing me and it made me feel like he only cared about his reputation and not about my pain. My vision was a bit weird in the eye that got hit. He has since apologized and I I told myself I was completely done with him. We tried to talk calmly after the incident, but this is not the first time he has overreacted about something minor, and like abusers, he has previously promised he wouldnt physically harm me. I know this isn’t the worst story of abuse, but his reason for the behavior is that he worried about me the whole day since not hearing anything. He blamed the fact that he couldn’t work because of being worried about me. He says he hasn’t been violent with any women ever before but then why me??

I haven’t been able to stop talking about Kauai since we got home, so we’re officially coming back next summer :) 

So, during our first trip we stayed in Poipu (right across from the beach house restaurant). I feel like we did a lot of the most popular things to do as a tourist. We went to several local farmers markets, did a zodiac boat tour/snorkel of the Napali coast, Smiths Luau, tubing at the old sugar cane farm, checked out Kauai coffee (didn’t do the tour though), saw the turtles on the beach in Poipu, went to Waimea canyon and drove up to the Kalalau lookout (stopped at other lookouts on the way back), went to the spouting horn, had professional photos taken at Tunnels and did a driving tour through Princeville via the Shaka guide app. 

We really loved what we did get to experience on the north end. We loved tunnels but didn’t get to have a beach day there. We briefly stopped at the Hanalei pier but didn’t stay due to the weather and we got pictures of the Kilauea lighthouse but didn’t get to go as we didn’t have tickets. We are really leaning towards staying in the Princeville area this time around and soaking in all the things we didn’t get much time at before.

1gginbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gginbp/how_fasting_turned_my_life_around_in_one_day/,How fasting turned my life around in one day,"Hey guys and gals, here’s a small report after two months of fasting twice a week.

I’m a 40 year old male who started fasting on the 31st of August, not to lose weight, but as a desperate attempt to alleviate chronic pain symptoms from an autoimmune disease. I’ve had the condition for almost 20 years, but the last five years have been increasingly tough. Aching limbs and muscles, brain fog and a flu-like feeling has become the norm, reducing my quality of life. I had read up on the effects of autophagy on inflammation and chronic pain and thought I ought to give it a go before seeking medical solutions. 

My first fast lasted 32 hours, during which my muscle pain just… evaporated. It really was like turning off a switch. Suddenly, all discomfort was gone and it was like waking up after a long, painful slumber. I was completely dumbfounded as the next two days continued to be pain free. They were the best days I’d experienced in years. 

I was wary of the fact that I could be having a placebo experience, but after a couple more fasts with similar results all doubt disappeared. This convinced me to keep it going, quickly settling on a twice-a-week routine, varying from 32 hours up to 60 hours or more, depending on my schedule. 

After deciding to commit to the schedule, I made an appointment with my doctor just to make sure she was OK with it - which she was. Her belief was that it would not impact my autoimmune condition (Hashimoto’s) in any negative way. So with her blessing, I kept on going.

As of today I’ve done 15 fasts over the last two months. I’ve had no muscle pains or inflammation issues since that first day. 

Right now I’m 50 hours into my first 72 hour fast ever, which I thought was a fitting way to end this two-month stint. The plan is to keep the twice-a-week schedule until new year, then rolling back to once a week from there. I only drink water and black coffee during fasting periods, as well as supplement with a healthy dose of magnesium and other vitamins.

Here’s my conclusion so far: As far as chronic pain goes, this has been a lifesaver. I am a transformed man. I’m now able to participate on a whole new level not only in my own life, but also in the life of my wife and two kids, which has been my biggest source of grievance these last years. Now it seems that those bad years are behind me, at least I hope so. Not all the fasts have been easy, but it’s always been less uncomfortable than having pain issues. I’ve been able to function these couple of months in the way I’ve always dreamt of doing, both as a dad and a husband. And, for the first time in a long, long time: I’m actually having fun and enjoying small moments of my everyday life, instead of just surviving. It’s like my body is finally lowering its guard and allowing me to have genuine feelings again.

Also, the 36 hour fasts are now a breeze. I actually feel my best during those days than the days I eat. 48+ hour fasts are not as easy, but still worth it for that autophagy burn.

The weight loss has been an added bonus. I was never overweight, but could stand to benefit from losing 15-20 pounds. Starting weight was around 88-89 kgs/195 lbs, right now I’m at 83 kgs/183 lbs. I will let it drop until I find the sweet spot, then let it stabilize.

So, for anyone struggling with chronic pain issues, please I urge you: Try this out. It’s free, it won’t hurt you (but follow my example and run it by your doctor just to be safe - your condition may not be the same as mine), and if it works, it might just open a new door. 

Finally, a big thanks to this subreddit and its contributors. Without it, I would probably have had a hard time piecing all the information together and figuring out what fasting program would suit me.",7,1730392075.0,fasting,6,1.0,False

sometimes it makes me feel energized and sometimes it makes me really sleepy , i like the effect better when i have coffee it feels like its doing more than if i just don’t drink it ,without it i don’t feel much, my brain is quiet but i cant stop moving my leg and if im still im picking at my scalp , and i lost my appetite and forget to eat during the day. 

I feel slower but jittery at the same time and sometimes find it hard to find the words i want to use in my head , also weirdly my sex drive has gotten much much higher and find it hard to feel satisfied , i like it cause i can concentrate and do tasks when i need to 98%of the time and sometimes because of my newly higher sex drive i get distracted with my partner and one time even  i didn’t go to school because i was late and wasn’t gonna make it in time its kinda obsesive and its never happened to me before.

again this usually happens when i don’t drink caffeine with it and feel less of an effect,also time can sometimes go by in the blink of an eye if im studying or doing stuff.

But then, the big boss showed up, everyone went back to work mode before he caught them, but the photographer was in the studio, with a closed door. So the boss enters the studio and what do we see? The guy dead asleep on the products, needless to say he got woken up with fear, but the boss said ""oh sleepy? Just wait i'll be right back"" with an evil smile, he went back to his office upstairs (probably to get something) and in the meantime, the photographer, as a functional, responsible adult, decided to run away! Bro left the building and hid in the office parking lot! When the boss came back he was furious because he went to get something in like one minute and poof, nobody there. And WE got chewed out for HIS dumba$$ery! And the next day, he showed up 3 hours late to make sure he doesn't run into him🤣 and to ask our forgiveness he bought us a round of coffees... i hate coffee, thanks man...

I've had this earbug for several years now, and I've finally yielded and decided to get help (you).

Basically, it's one of those frequently used ambient-y synth tracks from a lot of ""retro"" movie trailers. I was reminded of it from a scene in The Fall Guy, where Ryan Gosling is tied up (really trying to avoid spoilers; I thought it was a fun action comedy)..

Anyway, it's this kind of three-note (I think... pretty sure it's a 3/4) synth arpeggio in... some flavor of major (?) scale... very ""call to arms""-shift in tone of a movie.. I thought it might've been a Rush or Tears for Fears song, maybe even Journey (it's close to the intro to Separate Ways), but I haven't found it...

It feels like it might've been used in something like Hot Tub Time Machine, just for the retro vibe, but I couldn't find it there either..

Dear god interwebs, help me find the song, so my soul can finally rest..!

I've been in a relationship for about 18 months with an amazing girl whom I care for deeply. However, we've been disagreeing more frequently on certain topics, like politics and some other ideals on raising kids, etc… which has started to bother me. Lastly, I just got back from a trip (was gone to visit family for 5 days) and when I got back, I realized I just was not excited to see my s/o. It feels weird to say that, because I haven’t really felt that way. 

Recently, I've found myself thinking a lot about an ex-girlfriend from before this relationship. I never told her I loved her at the time, but I've come to realize that I did, and now I feel she might be the one that got away. I think about her often, especially since she moved away, and I’m struggling with the idea of reaching out for closure.

There’s an added complication: she may have a boyfriend now, and I definitely don’t want to jeopardize my current relationship. However, I sometimes feel that meeting for coffee might help me find the clarity I need.

I’m torn between the love I have for my current girlfriend and the unresolved feelings for my ex. 

I truly have not been able to shake the thought of her from my mind. Should I reach out for closure, or should I focus on my current relationship?

I know I know… this is probably a bit juvenile. It’s just the first time I’ve felt this…

I bought Trader Joe’s pre ground coffee - don’t hate me, but I should be able to use this with my pressurized basket right? I just wanna make sure that that’s OK and it won’t damage the machine.

2 years in a relationship and 4mos living in together. And I am currently 10wks pregnant. I was so sure talaga na I’m gonna marry him someday but day by day napapaisip ako. My mga ugali na hindi ko na nagugustohan.

BPO Employee ang partner and ako naman is a WFH freelancer. Sa chores, napapansin ko na madalas na ako na lang yung gumagalaw and expected niya ako talaga gagawa kasi WFH lang ako. Pitiks lang din naman kasi work ko. Pero HALF kami sa lahat ng bills. Masipag naman sya, lalo na pag nag-aaway kami lol. Nagpapalaundry kami and sya naglalaba ng mga damit na hindi pwede i-laundry. Minsan ako din naman naglalaba pag tamad siya. And siya din naglilinis ng apartment tuwing day off. 

Tuwing nagkakasakit ako, wala siyang initiative like bilhan ako ng gamot o kung ano ba dapat gawin, kailangan pa sabihan. Pero pag sya nagkakasakit alam ko ano gagawin. 

My anger issues din, tuwing galit siya laging nagmumura. Hindi naman directly sakin. It’s like “tangina” and tuwing umaalma ako sinasabi niya hindi naman daw “tanginamo” sinabi niya kaya hindi ako minumura niya. Ewan ko ba ganun ba yun. Lumaki kasi akong hindi palamura yung nasa paligid.

Last week, I was sick due to pregnancy. Hindi ko na control yung pagdumi kasi sobrang lala ng diarrhea ko and dumadaing nako sa sakit and mas nauna pa siyang mandiri kesa taningin ako kung ano ba masakit. Wala akong kain for almost 20hrs na din ata kasi wala akong gusto kainin at sinusuka ko lang din lahat. Dagdag pa yung sobrang lala ng UTI ko. Nagagalit sya kesyo ang dami daw problema. Hindi pa tapos yung isa meron nanaman na para bang ginusto ko magkasakit. Nauna pa yung galit kesa tanongin ako kung gutom ba ko alam naman niyang wala pakong kain. Galing siyang duty nito and wala pang tulog. Ending, hindi kami kumain and natulog na lang.

Ngayon namang long weekend. We decided na umuwi sa kanya kanyang tahanan (2hrs away sa city kung san kami nakatira) 2mos din siyang hindi nakauwi. Nag m-ml for hours kasi miss nya daw maglaro na walang lag, lag kasi dun sa apartment namin. Lumalabas with friends, nagkakape lang naman and tanong ako ng tanong. Like, 4hrs kang naglaro? Kanina ka pa ba nakarating jan sa coffee shop? Things like that lang naman at galit na galit. Sabi magpamiss naman daw ako at nabwebwesit sya tanong ako ng tanong. Ngayon na nga lang daw sya nakauwi panay pa tanong. Ewan ko lang talaga, baka sira lang ulo ko. Pero pag nakakasama niya talaga barkada niya at matagal kami hindi magkasama nag-iiba ugali niya. Ibang iba pag kami lagi magkasama.

BUT HERE’S THE CATCH NAMAN

He buys all the things na hilingin ko, bago sya umuwi galing work magtatanong siya ano ba gusto kong pagkain. (Picky eater ako simula nabuntis). Pag madyo matagal break nila like 2hrs, umuuwi sya dadalhan ako foods. Umuuwi agad after work. Pag my biglaang VTO sila, 5hrs early yung uwian. Umuuwi agad. Hindi sya gumagala with workmates or kung sino man. Yung sweldo, sa bills and needs namin napupunta.  Hindi siya madalas umuwi sa kanila while ako naman umuuwi samin every other week. Naiiwan lang siya dun sa apartment mag-isa. Hindi gumagala, tamang ML lang. 

Ngayon, nainis ako. Binlock ko. Nainis ako sa sinabing magpamiss naman daw at nakakainis, araw araw naman daw magkasama sa apartment bat daw ba tanong ng tanong.

Ako yata my problema.

Specially grateful to the representative, Aurora, of the company who guided me through connecting my new Yuka to my iPhone 16 pro. When I first installed it I owed the iPhone X but upgraded to the iPhone 16 (much needed) and for some reason I couldn't understand why I wasn't able to connect to the Yuka.  After endless attempts and tried as many options as I could, for ex. deleting the app several times and added it back, relocating the charging station and the RTK station, I finally emailed the company.  It was as simple as getting an updated firmware. Within a few hours I was up and running and Aurora was still in contact with me even after the connection was completed. I'm super grateful and so happy my Yuka 1500 is working amazingly. My yard is looking fantastic and the best part is I get to drink a cup coffee and watch it work. Not only does it saves me time in my day but the energy and sweat on those sunny summer days are a thing of the past.  I would recommend it to anyone who is not a fan of mowing their yard or doesn't have the time or energy. I get more done now that I don't have mowing the yard lawn as one of my chores.
