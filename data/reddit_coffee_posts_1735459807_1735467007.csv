Title: Cross-Court Connection  
In the heart of Indianapolis, under the bright lights of Gainbridge Fieldhouse, two stars from different basketball worlds found an unexpected connection. Caitlin Clark, the electrifying guard for the Indiana Fever, known for her sharpshooting and game-changing plays, had just wrapped up a practice session. Meanwhile, Tyrese Haliburton, the Pacers' point guard, renowned for his court vision and dazzling passes, was doing the same on the other side of the arena.  
As they both headed towards the exit, their paths crossed in the quiet corridor. Caitlin, still in her sweat-drenched jersey, was fiddling with her water bottle when she accidentally bumped into Tyrese, causing him to drop his phone.   
""Oh, I'm so sorry!"" Caitlin exclaimed, bending down to pick up the phone.  
""No worries,"" Tyrese laughed, his smile lighting up the dim hallway. ""I've been meaning to drop some calls anyway.""  
Their laughter mingled, creating a melody that seemed to echo through the empty halls. They walked together towards the parking lot, talking about the pressures of being young stars in a city that lived and breathed basketball. Tyrese shared tales of his high school games in Wisconsin, while Caitlin reminisced about her days in Iowa.  
The conversation flowed effortlessly, leading them to a local diner where they decided to grab a late dinner. Over burgers and fries, they discovered they had more in common than just basketball. They both loved old school hip-hop, had a soft spot for dogs, and shared a passion for community service.  
As the night turned into early morning, they found themselves sitting closer, their knees touching under the table. Tyrese looked at Caitlin, his eyes reflecting sincerity and a hint of something more. ""You know, I've always admired your game,"" he said, his voice low. ""But tonight, I think I've started to admire you more.""  
Caitlin blushed, the compliment catching her off guard. ""I could say the same,"" she replied, her voice steady but her heart racing. ""Your passes are pretty, but your company is even better.""  
They left the diner hand in hand, the city lights painting a backdrop for their burgeoning connection. In the days that followed, they were often seen together, not just at practices or games but at charity events, local festivals, and quiet coffee shops. Their bond became the talk of the town, a story of love that transcended rivalry, uniting fans from both the Fever and Pacers.  
As the season progressed, their on-court performances seemed to elevate with their off-court relationship. Caitlin's shots were more precise, and Tyrese's assists more magical, as if they were passing not just a basketball but love and inspiration across the court.  
Their love story became as legendary as their games, proving that sometimes, the greatest connections are made not just by chance, but by the heart's alignment with another's passion and drive. In Indianapolis, Caitlin Clark and Tyrese Haliburton weren't just stars; they were a constellation, shining together, lighting up the night sky of basketball and love.",1,1735466851.0,nbacirclejerk,0,1.0,False

1hot0vr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hot0vr,I love the visual of Apple Maps so much that I would love a CitySim Game to be in this style,"This post is translated into English:

Not sure why, but Apple Maps’ 3D models feel particularly refined to me. Maybe it’s the way shadows are handled, the perfectly balanced simplifications, the lighting, the color palette, the terrain, or perhaps the details like the trees. Whatever the reason, it gives me the same kind of elegance as games like Monument Valley. Other map apps are decent too, but they often feel slightly off in terms of integration.

Lately, I’ve been idly exploring cities in Apple Maps with DCE (Detailed City Experience) instead of checking out satellite 3D views. I’ve developed a real fondness for this non-realistic, “model-like” texture. Even when playing Cities: Skylines, I always find myself switching to the white model view.

Honestly, I’d love a city-building game with the visual style and texture of Apple Maps. Imagine a game where landmarks have unique models, transit lines flow semi-transparently through the city, and other buildings are procedurally generated with white models overlaid with colors to represent zoning and density. Traffic and pedestrians could simply be represented by dots of varying sizes to indicate flow. This could bring back the data-focused design of SimCity 4, which was much less reliant on realism. It would also avoid the performance demands and new issues introduced by agent-based systems in games like SimCity (2015) or Cities: Skylines.

Though not realistic, such a design could strike an excellent balance between visual quality, development cost, and performance requirements. It might even pave the way for a large-scale, in-depth city-building game on mobile platforms. Imagine it being added to Apple Arcade as a premium, ad-free game—that thought alone is exciting. My ultimate daydream? Apple themselves creating a game using Apple Maps’ UI and assets. That would be a dream come true.

In a way, Mini Metro and Mini Motorways touch on this concept, but they don’t quite reach this scale. If their studio created a “MiniCity,” it might come close to this idea.

Oddly enough, Tokyo still doesn’t have DCE， which is a shame",2,1735466644.0,applemaps,0,0.75,False

i got this job back in august, im a barista at a coffee shop. i love it, and i can genuinely see myself doing it for the next 4-6 years. 

i’m on the spectrum, if you talk to me it’s not super obvious, but i’m sure you could figure it out. watching me walk and move around is probably a bigger sign. i don’t just tell people that im autistic because i want them to get to know me first. i’m also just insanely insecure about it, id give anything and everything to just not be autistic. 

 long story short, i told a coworker (let’s call them billy for the sake of the post). billy said they picked up that i probably had something but wasn’t sure and didn’t want to ask as to not be rude, which is perfectly understandable. everyone i’ve told about my autism since then has been so kind. 

i’ve been working super hard to get situated into my job and learn all my coworkers names. i want to make friends here, and i want to learn who to avoid/maybe who isn’t nice? . i’ve worked a handful of shifts with this girl and she’s so rude every single time i work with her (lets call her riley for the sake of this post). she only ever says the most blunt things, bland expressions on her face, no signs of friendliness ever. she’s only ever like this to me and the other person with autism. i can name instances of her being pointlessly rude. 

although billy said that riley doesn’t like them either, so maybe she just doesn’t like certain people? but billy has a lot of empathy and tends to just say things to join. 

i told my boss about this whole mess and she’s talked to riley about it. it even ended up getting other people involved that had seen certain events which i wasn’t planning but they did help i suppose. post boss talking to riley my plan has been to straight up avoid her as much as i can, not be rude, but just neutral. if she needs help i’ll help her and leave the interaction asap. my plan was NEVER to deliberately ruin her life. 
we got shoved together to work on the same station and i was just trying to get it done, when she needed an order i would just slide it down, no problem. i think she’s began taking it the wrong way because i was dropping stuff off in the back and she came in there too and said “behind” and bumped me to the side. even now i can’t figure out if she meant to do that or not because it is cramped back there. 

i don’t know what to do about all this. it’s been stressing me out since it started. i’m tired of reporting back to hr - should i lend her an olive branch? if so im gonna write her a note apologizing, explaining, and asking her to text me or wait so we can talk in person.

Despite him being quirkless, Izuku grows up intelligent, resourceful, and fascinated by Aizawa’s underground hero work, as well as a subtle growing hate towards Endeavor and many other heroes. 

During one of Aizawa’s trips to the ‘grey zone’ - a neutral ground for heroes, villains, and vigilantes - to gather more information on a certain villain he was chasing down, Izuku decides to tag along and unexpectedly bumps into Giran, who sees potential in the boy’s incredible analytical abilities.

Fascinated by the morally grey world of the underground, Izuku begins secretly visiting Giran whenever Aizawa returns to the grey zone. Over time, Giran became his unofficial mentor, teaching Izuku the art of negotiation, strategy, and manipulating. In return, Izuku begins to help him behind the scenes, analyzing quirks, weaknesses, and strategies for clients who pay a hefty amount. Starting off as a harmless side gig, the job quickly spirals down into something darker and deeper, and Isuku becomes infamous in the underground as one of the best analysts whose information has led to the downfall, and even death, of several pro heroes, causing Izuku’s reputation as an analyst to rise in the underground. 

But things take a turn when Tsukauchi takes on the case of the new analyst who has been causing so much problems for the heroes. With more and more evidence (and stress) piling up, Tsukauchi gets the help of Nezu and Eraserhead, unknowingly pulling Izuku’s adoptive father into an investigation against him. Izuku, aware of the case, has to put more caution and care into maintaining his double identity while avoiding the detective.

1hosm4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hosm4b/cracking_down_on_windshield_wipers_a_surprising/,"Cracking Down on Windshield Wipers: A Surprising Turn in Transportation Policy
By James Taylor","

I wasn’t expecting much that morning. It was another press briefing, another policy announcement, and this one was about—of all things—windshield wipers. I barely made it in time, clutching a lukewarm cup of coffee and dragging along Ralph, my eager intern.

Ralph, bright-eyed and carrying his notebook like it was the Rosetta Stone, was practically bouncing as we took our seats near the back. “This is big, James,” he whispered, barely containing his excitement.

“Sure, Ralph,” I muttered, sipping my coffee. “Windshield wipers. Big stuff.”

But as Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy took the podium, I couldn’t help but feel a slight shift in the room. The buzz of the crowd wasn’t just idle chatter—it was genuine interest. People leaned forward, pens poised, cameras ready.

Duffy started strong. “For too long, we’ve overlooked the tools that keep us safe in everyday conditions,” he said, holding the room’s attention like a seasoned performer. “Windshield wipers might seem trivial, but they’re not. They’re essential.”

I glanced at Ralph, who was already furiously scribbling notes. “You buying this?” I asked under my breath.

“Just listen,” he hissed back, his enthusiasm bordering on reverence.

Duffy continued, outlining the administration’s plan to standardize wiper speeds and introduce adaptive technology. “How many of you have driven in a downpour, flipping through wiper settings that are either too slow or too fast?” he asked. Hands shot up across the room. Mine stayed down, though I had to admit I’d been there.

“It’s a small problem,” Duffy said, “but it’s a solvable one. And we’re here to solve it.”

The crowd applauded. Ralph was nodding like Duffy was reading his diary. I leaned closer to him. “This is theater,” I said, half-whispering.

“Maybe,” Ralph shot back, “but it’s good theater.”

Then, the unexpected happened: a live video feed from President Trump himself.

“America deserves the best,” Trump declared, his voice booming through the speakers. “Even in the little things. Think about your own body—think about the way your pee hole works. It lets out what it needs to, in the right amount, at the right time. It’s efficient. It’s natural. It’s perfect. That’s what we’re aiming for with windshield wipers. We want them to respond just like that: no more, no less, just right.”

The crowd froze for a moment, unsure whether to laugh or applaud. Then, slowly, applause began to spread, and before long, the room was cheering. Trump grinned from the screen. “This administration is about solutions that make life better for every single citizen. No more squinting through streaked windshields on the way to work.”

The energy was undeniable. Duffy closed the briefing with more technical details, but it was Trump’s bizarre yet oddly effective analogy that everyone would remember.

By the time the briefing ended, I had to admit—I was impressed. Not because windshield wipers suddenly seemed world-changing, but because they’d found a way to make people care.

Walking out, Ralph was practically glowing. “So, what’d you think?” he asked.

I shrugged. “They sold it well,” I admitted. “Still not sure it’s the revolution they’re pitching, but… they sold it.”

Ralph grinned. “Told you it was big.”

That's when I murdered Ralph. We were in the elevator by then, and I just hated his face, so I jabbed my pen into his neck and twisted it around - utterly enjoying the look of shock on his face, while his blood spurted everywhere. 

I hid his body in a trash can on the basement floor, and then wheeled the trash can all the way to my house. I met like five people along the way, and joked with all of them about being a killer and they all laughed like idiots who know that nothing bad ever happens. 

I'll be eating Ralph for a month or so. He's in ziplock bags in my freezer now.  It's okay to eat human meat, as long as you cook it - that's just science.

 long story short, i told a coworker (let’s call them billy for the sake of the post). billy said they picked up that i probably had something but wasn’t sure and didn’t want to ask as to not be rude, which is perfectly understandable. everyone i’ve told about my autism since then has been so kind. 

i’ve been working super hard to get situated into my job and learn all my coworkers names. i want to make friends here, and i want to learn who to avoid/maybe who isn’t nice? . i’ve worked a handful of shifts with this girl and she’s so rude every single time i work with her (lets call her riley for the sake of this post). she only ever says the most blunt things, bland expressions on her face, no signs of friendliness ever. she’s only ever like this to me and the other person with autism. i can name instances of her being pointlessly rude. 

although billy said that riley doesn’t like them either, so maybe she just doesn’t like certain people? but billy has a lot of empathy and tends to just say things to join. 

i told my boss about this whole mess and she’s talked to riley about it. it even ended up getting other people involved that had seen certain events which i wasn’t planning but they did help i suppose. post boss talking to riley my plan has been to straight up avoid her as much as i can, not be rude, but just neutral. if she needs help i’ll help her and leave the interaction asap. my plan was NEVER to deliberately ruin her life. 
we got shoved together to work on the same station and i was just trying to get it done, when she needed an order i would just slide it down, no problem. i think she’s began taking it the wrong way because i was dropping stuff off in the back and she came in there too and said “behind” and bumped me to the side. even now i can’t figure out if she meant to do that or not because it is cramped back there. 

i don’t know what to do about all this. it’s been stressing me out since it started. i’m tired of reporting back to hr - should i lend her an olive branch? if so im gonna write her a note apologizing, explaining, and asking her to text me or wait so we can talk in person.

### How Water Supports Your Energy Levels

Your body is made up of about 60% water, impacting almost every system that keeps you functioning optimally. When you're well-hydrated, your body operates smoothly, leading to increased energy levels. Here’s how drinking enough water contributes to your vitality:

1. **Boosts Physical Performance:** Dehydration can lead to fatigue and reduced physical performance. If you engage in exercise, adequate hydration keeps your muscles working efficiently, reducing fatigue and enhancing endurance.

5. **Enhances Mood:** Did you know that dehydration can negatively impact your mood? Feeling low or irritable can be a sign of not drinking enough water. Staying hydrated leads to an overall boost in mood and motivation.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a refillable water bottle with you. This will remind you to drink water throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone to set reminders for water breaks. Regular intervals can help ensure you’re drinking enough.
- **Infuse Your Water:** If plain water doesn’t excite you, try infusing it with fruits or herbs for added flavor and enjoyment.
- **Eat Water-Rich Foods:** Incorporate fruits and vegetables with high water content into your diet, like cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon.
- **Drink Before Meals:** Make it a habit to drink a glass of water before each meal. This not only helps with hydration but can also improve digestion.

### Finding the Right Balance

Generally, it's recommended to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, but you might need more depending on your lifestyle.

Listening to your body is key. If you feel thirsty, it’s a signal to drink water. Remember that hydration is a crucial part of maintaining your energy levels. You’ll notice a significant difference in how you feel when you prioritize proper hydration.

The Role of Water in Weight Management
--------------------------------------

Water is essential to our lives, playing a vital role in maintaining our overall health. When it comes to weight management, the significance of water cannot be overstated. It serves various functions that contribute to weight loss and helps to regulate body processes effectively. Understanding these roles can empower you to make simpler choices toward healthier living.

First and foremost, drinking water can act as an appetite suppressant. When you consume water before meals, it fills your stomach, which can make you feel fuller and help you eat less. This practice can be particularly useful if you struggle with overeating. Studies have shown that people who have a glass of water before their meals tend to consume fewer calories and can contribute to weight loss over time.

Moreover, water is a low-calorie beverage choice. Substituting high-calorie drinks like soda, juice, or sugary coffees with water can drastically reduce your daily caloric intake. It’s an easy swap with significant benefits. You can hydrate your body without adding unnecessary calories, making it a smart decision in any weight management plan.

Additionally, staying properly hydrated is crucial for efficient metabolism. Water plays a key role in the metabolic process, helping to break down food and convert it into energy. When you are dehydrated, your metabolic rate can slow down, making it harder for your body to burn calories effectively. Thus, drinking enough water can promote a more active metabolism, which aids significantly in weight management.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
One interesting aspect of water and weight management is its influence on exercise performance. When you’re well-hydrated, you often feel more energized and ready to work out. This can lead to improved performance during physical activities. Whether you’re hitting the gym, going for a run, or participating in group classes, proper hydration can make a huge difference in your endurance and overall experience. Being hydrated fosters an environment for better results, which directly impacts weight loss efforts.

Another benefit worth mentioning is that drinking water can help with waste removal. Adequate water intake helps your kidneys filter waste out of the blood, and excess water along with other fluids gets excreted through urine. This process ensures toxins don’t build up in your body, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
In addition to direct benefits, incorporating water into your daily routine can promote more mindful eating behaviors. Choosing water over snacks or sugary foods can slow down your consumption and encourage you to make healthier, more thoughtful choices regarding what you eat and drink.

- **Drink water before meals:** Helps control hunger and reduces calorie intake.
- **Use water as a beverage:** Substitute for sugary drinks to cut calories.
- **Stay hydrated:** Supports efficient metabolism and energy levels.
- **Optimize exercise:** Higher energy and performance during workouts.
- **Enhance waste removal:** Promotes kidney function and detoxification.
- **Encourage mindful eating:** Reduces snacking urge and promotes healthier choices.

It's crucial, however, to listen to your body’s hydration needs. The amount of water you need daily can vary depending on various factors, such as your activity level, body composition, and climate. A good rule of thumb is to aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day, but some may need more. Consider carrying a reusable water bottle to track your intake easily and remind you to sip throughout the day.

Water into your weight management journey is a straightforward and effective strategy. It’s a simple habit that can lead to extraordinary benefits, helping you maintain your weight while supporting overall health. Next time you reach for a drink, remember the vital role water plays in your quest for better living.

Understanding the Impact of Water on Skin Health
------------------------------------------------

Drinking enough water is crucial for your body, and this includes your skin. The skin is the largest organ, and like all your body systems, it needs proper hydration to function. When you don’t drink sufficient water, your skin can become dry, flaky, and less elastic. Let’s explore how water impacts skin health and why staying hydrated is essential.

### The Role of Water in Maintaining Skin Health

Your skin is made up of cells, and cells require water to maintain their structure and function. When you’re well-hydrated, your skin can perform its duties better, such as protection against damage, temperature regulation, and overall health.

- **Prevention of Skin Conditions:** Sufficient water intake may lower the chances of developing skin problems like eczema and psoriasis.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

- **Thirst:** Drink when thirsty, as your body has mechanisms to signal when it needs water.
- **Urine Color:** Aim for light yellow urine, which usually indicates proper hydration.
- **Physical Activity:** Increase your water intake during exercise or hot weather to replace fluids lost through sweat.

### Other Ways to Hydrate Your Skin

In addition to drinking water, you can keep your skin hydrated through various methods:

- **Moisturizers:** Use creams or lotions that contain hydrating ingredients to lock in moisture.
- **Humidifiers:** Using a humidifier in your home can add moisture to the air, benefiting your skin.
- **Hydrating Foods:** Foods with high water content, like cucumbers and watermelon, contribute to your hydration, supporting skin health.

Water is an essential part of skin health. By ensuring you drink enough water and incorporating hydrating practices into your routine, you can significantly improve your skin’s appearance and texture. Remember, your skin reflects your internal health, so treat it well and drink up!

- **Drink a Glass Before Meals:** Not only will this help with hydration, but it can also aid digestion.

Building a habit takes time. Attach drinking water to an existing routine to help solidify the practice. For instance, drink a glass of water when you wake up, before every meal, and before bedtime. Connecting it to daily activities will make it easier to remember.

Keeping track of how much water you drink can keep you accountable. You can use a simple notebook or a tracking app to log each glass. Knowing how much you’ve consumed can motivate you to reach your goals.

### Stay Mindful of Your Body

Pay attention to your body’s signals. Thirst is a clear indicator that you need water, but also consider other signs, like fatigue or dry skin. These can suggest dehydration as well. By being aware of your body’s needs, you can better understand how much water you should be drinking.

- **Infused Waters:** Create your own unique blends using fruits and herbs.
- **Sparkling Water:** Opt for unsweetened sparkling water for a fizzy alternative.

Increasing your daily water intake doesn't have to be a daunting task. By implementing these straightforward strategies, you can make hydration an integral part of your lifestyle. Remember, staying hydrated is not only vital for physical health but also boosts your mood, energy levels, and overall well-being. So grab a glass and drink up!

### Conclusion

I read that only old license not yet expired can have smoking corners but how can public and common people verify and check if the coffeeshop is allowed to have smoking corners?

I had thought given the time most coffee shops should have fully banned smoking cigarettes. 

How can we reach out to the Govt and authorities to push for more changes except through my MPs. I really hope more and more gets done to eradicate cigarette smoking in Singapore. It will do great winders for our reputation too.

In our busy lives, staying hydrated and keeping our drinks at the right temperature is very important. A thermos bottle, with its advanced insulation, has become essential. Let’s explore why you need one.

# 1. Temperature Retention

**Always the Right Temperature:** Thermos bottles keep your drinks hot or cold for a long time. Whether it's hot coffee on a cold morning or ice-cold water on a hot day, a thermos bottle makes sure your drink is perfect.

# 2. Convenience and Portability

**Easy to Carry:** Thermos bottles fit easily into your routine. They come in different sizes and fit well in bags, backpacks, or car holders. Whether you're at work, the gym, or traveling, your favorite drink is always ready.

# 3. Eco-Friendly Choice

**Good for the Environment:** Using a thermos bottle reduces the use of single-use plastic bottles and cups. This small change helps the environment a lot. Many thermos bottles are also made from recyclable materials.

# 4. Cost-Effective

**Save Money:** A good thermos bottle can save you money. Instead of buying coffee or cold drinks daily, make your drinks at home and carry them with you. Over time, this saves a lot of money.

# 5. Versatility

**More Than Just Drinks:** Thermos bottles are versatile. They can keep soups and stews warm too. Perfect for carrying lunch to work or school. Some come with strainers for tea or wide openings for easy filling and cleaning.

# 6. Health Benefits

**Safe and Healthy:** A thermos bottle ensures you have clean and safe drinking water. This is important when traveling to places with uncertain water quality. Avoiding plastic bottles also reduces health risks from chemicals like BPA.

# 7. Durability

**Long-Lasting:** High-quality thermos bottles are durable and can handle daily use. Made from stainless steel, they resist rust and damage, making them reliable for any adventure.

# 8. Stylish and Trendy

**Looks Great:** Modern thermos bottles come in many designs, colors, and patterns. They can be a style statement, reflecting your personality and preferences. There's a thermos bottle for everyone.

# 9. Maintains Flavor

**Keeps Drinks Fresh:** The insulation in thermos bottles preserves the flavor of your drinks. Enjoy your coffee or tea without any metallic taste, and your cold drinks stay refreshing.

# 10. Promotes Hydration

**Stay Hydrated:** Having a thermos bottle encourages you to drink more water throughout the day. It helps you stay hydrated, which is important for your health.

In conclusion, a thermos bottle is essential for enhancing your lifestyle. From keeping drinks at the right temperature to being eco-friendly and cost-effective, the benefits are clear. If you haven't got one yet, now is the perfect time.

The siblings lounged on the empty red brick veranda in the early morning light; the two of them were still wiping sleep from their eyes as they huddled around a circular mesh-metal table. The clown drank coffee, mumbled about the bartender they’d met in Dallas and idly asked his sister if she believed they had any eggs to put in the drink. She fiddled with the tablet she’d scavenged from the disaster camp and simply shook her head at his inquiry. Hoichi sat there in a thin white bathrobe and a pair of complimentary sandals that were provided by the hotel. Trinity’s attire matched her brother’s. Their faces had the dulled, refreshed quality of people freshly bathed.

“Maybe there’s no charge,” said Hoichi; he slurped at the edge of his white mug. His gaze drifted to the vaguely pergola-esque overhang through which the morning sun scarcely came through. No others had joined them—the only other person they’d seen since waking had been their waiter. The other tables, three others in total, remained empty besides their unlit candle centerpieces. Hoichi coughed, took another sip of his coffee, “Maybe you need to charge it, I said.”

Trinity tossed the tablet onto the mesh table which offered an unpleasant screech as it slid across the surface. “Well, what good is it then?”

“It’s early,” said Hoichi.

Trinity nodded and craned back in her seat as much as her shoulders would allow; she rested her hands across her stomach, a stomach which she distended with mock exaggeration. “Someone will buy it anyway, I’m sure. They’ll melt it down or—I don’t know. It’s worth something.”

“How’s the scratch?” asked Hoichi.

“Enough for last night. Tonight too. But, I’d like to stay awhile.”

“Did you see those people in the street last night? The ones at the gate? The ones at the stalls—I think that’s what they were doing. Selling stuff.”

“I always heard Roswell had some eccentrics, but it’s like anywhere else,” Trinity cut her eyes at her brother, “Doesn’t matter. I told you I wanted to rest wherever we went. And here we are. I’m so fucking tired. How’s the foot?”

The clown lifted his right foot and exposed the torn bubble there upon his heel; it was a ruptured blister. The skin was irritated, angry, red. “The boot’s been rubbing me wrong for a while. I just need a new pair.”

Trinity stared at the unmoving tablet on the table. “Should’ve grabbed a new pair when you had the chance.”

Hoichi nodded, “Sure. Should’a, could’a, would’a. Maybe I’m tired too.” He put his foot back to the ground, planted both of his legs there and pillared his arms on either side of his cup, so that his cheeks rested on his palms. “I didn’t realize it until last night. With that bed—a bed all to myself. God, I woke up this morning sore. In a good way,” he nodded, “How about you?”

“I like our room. Our beds.” It was her turn for her eyes to drift to the overhang; a glance of sunlight struck across her face, and she blinked and shifted so her face was entirely within shade. “What’s the plan? We don’t talk enough about it.”

“We talk about it, don’t we?”

“I’m scared, Hoichi.”

His eyes met hers and they remained locked like that for seconds without either of them breaking the silence. “Me too,” said the clown.

“Let’s say we find somewhere where no one knows our past,” said the hunchback.

He nodded for her to continue while taking another mouthful from his cup.

“Let’s say we do. What then? Do we get jobs? What kind of jobs? Do we just make pretend and have a family?”

“Bold of you to offer,” said the clown. He chuckled.

“I didn’t mean together,” Trinity rolled her eyes.

“I know,” said Hoichi, “I love you, alas my heart belongs elsewhere.”

“I’d like that though,” said Trinity, “I’d like that more than anything. I want to pretend, even if it hurts me in the long run. I want a family. I want someone to fall in love with me and I want to fall in love with them too.”

“Children?” asked the clown.

“Maybe,” shrugged Trinity, “It wouldn’t matter as long as someone loved me. I want to feel normal. I know normal is relative, but you know what I mean, don’t you?”

He nodded and frowned.

“More than anything, I want a moment of peace. Tuscaloosa wasn’t that and that’s where all the freedom seekers went. Dallas. Memphis. Kansas City. I want a place to be, and every place we go, I ask myself if it’s the one. It seems like wherever we go, there’s someone out to get us. I’ve got this idea of what life’s supposed to be like. I’d work in the gardens, and I’d hang out among animals and smell flowers and grow food straight out of the ground—I’d cook too—I’m not too good at it, I know, but I’d do it. I’d never be so rich that anyone wanted anything from me, but I’d never be so poor as to worry. I don’t want much. I want a life, is that so much to ask for?”

“Of course not.”

She planted her face in her hands and continued to go through a muffle, “Just a life. One good one. Like I said, I’ve got this idea of it. I’d come home to a place not too large and not too small. I’d never need to sleep on the ground again because I’d have a bed. One I own. Maybe,” she pointed at her brother, “Maybe like you said, I’d have kids waiting for me there. But that wouldn’t matter. I’d love them, kids, of course. But I just want a place. A life. Somewhere to be. Even without kids, there’d be someone there waiting on me. Or maybe they came from wherever they were during the day, and we’d cook together, and then I wouldn’t need to worry about being a subpar cook, because they’d be there and maybe they’d know how. It’s silly, I know.”

Trinity lifted her head from her hands, revealing the diamonds in her eyes. She shook her head as though to remove the jewels there.

Hoichi smiled stiffly and moved his hand across the table, but by the time she was within reach of him, her eyes had gone dry, and she smiled back at him.

The waiter abruptly arrived upon the scene and asked if they were ready for food.

Hoichi asked for a refill on his coffee and asked if they ever put eggs in it. The waiter politely declined.

Trinity ordered water.

For the rest of the morning, the pair gorged themselves on stale toast, pressed sausage, potatoes.

They remained in silence until they returned to their room.

 

\*\*\*

 

“It’s a festival,” called the young woman, “Once a year, the aliens come, and one of these years, they’re going to take us with them.”

“You think so?” Hoichi raised his brow and crossed his arms; his sister stood alongside him there on the jack-rabble sidewalk. After settling their tab with the hotel, the siblings departed to find cheaper lodgings and had become sidetracked by a mass of spectators gathered on the corner of Main and Frazier. The spectators—many of whom wore makeshift antennae or oversized black goggles—had all painted themselves green; the stuff was pungent in the dry heat and much of the green ran from their skin with sweat; this did not seem to dissuade anyone’s enthusiasm. The siblings, further surrounded by the group as some went to dance in the street, covered the lower halves of their faces. The signs, either plastered against street posts, or held over the heads of the fervent crowd, read a variety of messages. TAKE US HOME. SAVE US. WE’RE READY! Many of the bystanders carried handheld speaker radios, all tuned to the same station. From all speakers, ‘Acid Raindrops’ blared.

An ancient vehicle was pushed backwards down Frazier, then those gathered halted the wheels of the strange thing with misshapen stones so it would shift no longer, and a boyish man examined the nozzle on the rear of the vehicle; it was a great hollowed thing with a massive, cradled tanker. The boyish man began passing out drinks to the others as they queued.

The young woman, which was kind enough to offer them directions, guffawed at Hoichi’s inquiry, “Of course! I’m surprised you didn’t know already. Isn’t that why you put your face together like that?” She pointed at him so closely that she might’ve fingered his nostril.

The clown winced from the woman’s hand and swatted the air between them while taking a step from the sidewalk into the street. He pivoted as though to further confront the young woman, but she was already gone among her people, snaking around the vehicle.

“Hey!” he called after, “What’s aliens?”

No one paid him mind, save his sister. She shrugged. “Little green men, aren’t they?”

“Are they some kind of demon? Mutant? Are they human?”

“Don’t ask me,” said Trinity; her gaze remained on the strange vehicle and the man dispersing drinks to the crowd, “I’ll be right back.”

She too disappeared into the crowd and Hoichi was left alone.

He straightened his robe, tugged on the waist of his jeans, and returned to the sidewalk and leaned against the nearest unsullied post.

The electric speakers continued their music; another track, and another, and another, and then a voice, smooth and masculine, came clearly through them all.

“This is your pal, Psycho-Jam, with another hour of variety music, every hour, on the hour. Don’t forget to tune in every day for Apache radio, the greatest station in all these continental, once united states.” There was a brief pause on the radios and a minor bit of static, before the man’s voice returned, “It’s ten-thirty-eight this fine morning, on July seventh of our Lord’s year twenty-two-sixteen.” Another pause.

The crowd gathered there on the corner of Main became further enthralled with their libations as a woman on stilts towered over the ever-thickening throng. She wore a pair of improvised disco balls on her hands, and they reflected light in harsh glances across Hoichi’s face. He turned, crossed his arms, averted his eyes to the ground entirely.

The man on the radio spoke again, “I feel like I can hear those nuts in Roswell celebrating from here—""

Whatever followed was immediately drowned out by the conjoined yelps and cries of pleasure at their mention from the citizens of Roswell.

“Of course,” said the voice, as the festival goers cooed to a minimum, “You know I’m joking. I love you crazy bastards! Keep it tuned and keep those Republic borders on the furthest horizon, alien lovers, because I’ve a special track. This one goes out to all of you, beamed directly from my soul to yours.”

A pause followed before the music.

‘Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft’ played hesitantly from the speakers and another round of cheers erupted from the festival goers.

The makeshift vehicle, which was well surrounded, rocked on its axles as the crowd grew impatient, fervent; the boyish man that dispensed the drink called for the people to calm and they did, if only a bit.

Hoichi watched them, then cast his gaze to the sky that’d gone pink; he moved his mouth like he intended to speak something, but he never produced anything—the clown hunkered there by the post, stared into the gutter, watched the cars and battery wagons which angled down Main; many of those occupied vehicles kept their speed to a cruise and no one honked.

The festival was in full swing.

A finger tapped Hoichi’s shoulder, and he rose to stand and greet the return of Trinity—she carried with her two cups and passed one to her brother. They drank the strange greenish liquid and Trinity grinned while Hoichi sipped and neither of them understood they were consuming ayahuasca laced brew. The hallucinogenic properties took time.

Trinity smacked her lips and leaned into the shoulder of her brother and whispered, “You heard it on the radio, didn’t you? The border’s behind us, huh? Maybe we’ve come somewhere they won’t touch. Maybe we’re good.”

Hoichi drank heartily and commented that he was fairly thirsty in the heat.

 

\*\*\*

 

Trinity awoke suddenly, covered in sweat, totally unclothed in a strange bed; she lay on her side, staring at a brown wall and a marred vanity table. A finger traced her spine delicately; the finger and the person which it belonged to was behind her, unseen. There were no blankets, and she remained like that for minutes, glaze-eyed, before she launched from the bed and fell onto the floor. She spun around, scrambling, leering; she seemed like a strange marionette on her own feet and planted her hands onto the vanity table for support. She recognized none of her surroundings, nor the person which remained prone in the bed.

The person there, a stranger woman, laid exposed herself; she grinned at Trinity, rose on the pillow tucked beneath her head and supported herself with an elbow. The woman’s hair was flax-colored, stiff but long and thick. A mild green hue remained on the woman’s skin; she’d been unable to wash the paint away entirely. “It’s the middle of the day, you know,” was all the woman said.

Trinity’s breaths came in wild bouts, and she twisted around to look at her own face in the vanity’s mirror—her eyes were red, veiny. She smacked her lips together, swallowed, twisted her fists in her eyes. She shook her head and pivoted round again to examine the woman on the bed, “I’m thirsty,” she gurgled; her voice erupted from her throat deeply and she coughed. The hunchback shook her head again and her eyes shot around the room.

It was a bedroom—it was lived-in; across the vanity there was makeup, brushes, and cheaply made trinkets. The overhead bulb, recessed in the ceiling, was off. All light that lit the room came in through a window beyond the woman on the bed, hanging there in the wall, draped with thin curtains. Beneath Trinity’s feet was carpet, a large area rug rolled across stone flooring. The walls, smooth and plainly gray, were amateurly decorated with scrawling sets of desert flowers, seemingly done with black ink. Along the wall nearest the foot of the bed was a door that led on to some unknown place. By the door stood a chest of drawers.

Trinity was erect there by the vanity table, shivering and rubbing her arms. “Water please,” she asked the strange woman in the bed.

The woman’s smile broadened further, and she rose from the bed and found the blanket which belonged to the bed—it was a thin, sheet-like thing, balled on the floor on the opposite side of the room; she pulled the blanket over her shoulders and wrapped it around her body, togalike. “You’re probably wondering if we had sex, aren’t you?” The woman tilted her head while her eyes traced Trinity’s nudity. “We did not,” she said firmly, “You were burning up, vomiting. You had too much, I believe.”

Trinity shook her head and swallowed again. She covered her crotch and chest with her hands. “Just water please.”

The woman crossed the room, moved to the door and snatched a ribbon from the chest of drawers. This, she used to tie her hair back. She laughed at the hunchback and disappeared from the room, leaving the door half-open.

“Where’s my brother?” asked Trinity.

“Huh?” called the woman from the place she’d entered.

“The clown! Where’s the clown?”

 

\*\*\*

 

The Nephilim lumbered across the dirt plain with the sun high in the sky. He snorted and dragged his forearm across his nose and snorted again. Over his body, he wore the paint-horse cloak and nothing else.

Behind him, he dragged a still body by a naked ankle, leaving in his wake a broad trail leading in the direction from which he’d come.

The Nephilim stopped for a moment, stood stiffly upright, dropping the foot from his hand; the massive humanoid creature lifted his fists far over his head, stretching his muscles. His joints resounded several pops then he relaxed and angled around to the body he’d taken so far. The thing remained unmoving besides steady breathing.

Hoichi was the body, not quite asleep, not quite coherent; his eyelids fluttered in response to the looming shadow of The Nephilim.

The creature hunkered down nearer the man’s face and delicately brushed the captive’s cheek with the back of his hand. *Hübscher Clown,* said the creature.

While the results weren’t ideal, they were good enough for us to finally move forward with the mock transfer. It’s taken such a long time to reach this point, and I’m feeling incredibly nervous. I’ve never made it this far before, and I feel like I’m stepping into the unknown. I’ve never had a thorough discussion with my doctor about this stage since our primary focus was always on egg retrievals.

On top of that, I’ve gained weight after my last two retrievals, and I’m worried it might affect the transfer (mock and actual). I’ve also been drinking coffee daily (which I plan to stop). For whatever reason, once I started birth control my cravings have been intense. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions on how to prepare for the mock transfer? If you’ve been through this stage, I’d love any advice on what to expect or how to prepare for what’s ahead.

Here’s where I’m at: I was on birth control for a few weeks due to the holidays. I’m now off it, waiting for my cycle to start, and gearing up for my first mock transfer appointment. I’ve been told I’ll start estrogen patches the day after, and I have so many questions:
	•	Where exactly should I place the patches?
	•	What time of day should I apply them?
	•	What symptoms might I experience, and is there anything I can do to ease them?

I’m especially anxious because of my family history. My mom used hormonal patches post-menopause to address hormonal issues, and she ended up developing breast cancer. Her doctor, who also had breast cancer, prescribed the same patches to another family member, who later developed breast cancer too.

1hos8it,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hos8it/23f_need_advice_on_how_to_have_more_self_respect/,"23F. Need advice on how to have more self respect. Also, am on day 3 of no contact.","When I was in 6th grade, a boy two years older than me, who used to be my neighbour spread a rumour that he watched me bathing through the bathroom window and that he’s also kissed me in the lips. . My neighbourhood is quite conservative. The rumour spread fast and soon everybody started talking about it. All the kids started treating me differently, made fun of me. The adults judged me. Kids in school also got to know about it. So basically, it became very difficult for me to step outside without feeling a lot of shame. 
I moved to a different city for school in 8th grade. 
When covid started, I had just started college (online). I started dating this boy from my old school. We would mostly talk online. Met a few times. But then I found out from a mutual friend who told me that he was actually seeing someone else and that he was cheating on her with me. When i confronted him about it, he blocked me from everywhere. This relationship had lasted for 6 months. I felt like a loser for not having been more aware. It was my first relationship.
Then two years ago, I started dating this guy who was 31 at the time. I fell in love with him. He made me feel very loved and cared for. He would always take random pictures and videos of me. He was funny, was kind to people and seemed a very nice person overall. I thought very highly of him. But he never introduced me to his friends or family. He said it’s because he’s afraid they would judge the relationship and he didn’t want their negativity. But this always bothered me. Sometimes I would get too upset and then he started telling me I need to go to therapy. He never let me use his phone in the beginning. Then after a year and a half into the relationship, he let me. There was nothing suspicious on his phone.Then on September 30 of this year, he was in the gym and I had asked for his iPad to study with. It was the first time I was using it. I looked through his iMs. 
On it, there were conversations with tens of girls. They were from December of 2022 till August of 2024. We had started dating in October 2022. I was shattered. With some girls, the conversations lasted for a month, with others for up to three months. He had also made plans to see two girls multiple times but it seems like they turned him down.
When he came back from the gym, I confronted him. He cried and said he’s sorry and he would do whatever it takes to keep me from leaving. I drowned myself in alcohol for two days. I didn’t want to leave him. I loved him too fkin much. After a few days, I asked him to make some changes. I asked to not be kept a secret. He said yes to everything. I felt like he meant all of it because he would cry with me. But then he didn’t make any change. And slowly, he started becoming cold and distant. When I would finish crying, he would get up and go about his work whistling or would get on his phone. He said I make him feel badly. Whereas I was just asking him to be accountable and fix things. He was refusing to change. So when I would fight and cry about it, he started saying he doesn’t want to deal with the emotions that he’s feeling. He said he wants us to try again. We can start as friends and then see where it goes. He said I should have a relationship with him but with zero expectations. I refused. I wanted changes. This loop continued till November 29. 
I knew it in my brain that I need to leave this guy. But my heart wouldn’t let me. 
Then in December, he became a completely cold person. It started feeling like I was chasing him so bad and he wanted nothing to do with me.
I finally accepted he just doesn’t want me. But I didn’t want to let go of him.
Then finally on December 26, he said he wants to end things but still wants me in his life. That his guilt kills him. I don’t know if I believe him.I refused and said I can’t be his friend. Started no contact.
I miss him terribly and wait for his text every hour. But I know he’ll never text me. Sometimes I wonder if I should ask to meet for a coffee and have one last talk with him. But I know he doesn’t care for it.
I put with everything that he did because I didn’t want to lose him. I have spent every single day since sept 30 crying at least once. I’m tired of it all. I know I have to heal but the months spent healing will be very painful and I don’t want to live those months. 
To live with the realisation that I was never important to this man hurts so bad. To have thought a 31 yo would actually want to be with me, I was stupid. ",2,1735463048.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

*Planned release date: January 2026*


Developer reportedly trying to build ""an accurate-as-possible to-scale open world gaming map of the Inner Loop of Houston, Texas using photogrammetry"". Called ""Spacebound: Houston"", you play Tristan Jones in an alternate future 2050s, where you're trying to raise money to repair Nero and ""get back out there""

Upcoming action-adventure alternate future open world game **Spacebound: Houston**


Set in an alternate future sometime in the 2050s, you play Tristan Jones, a 20something year old former UESF cadet (United Earth Space Force) who is stuck on Earth after badly damaging his ""baby"", Nero and getting himself kicked out of the Navy for assaulting a fellow cadet. 

""Nero"", Tristan's private space corvette, is badly damaged and in need of repairs, but a broke Tristan has to try and raise funds in a variety of ways in order to repair the ship, fix the Jump Drive, E-Drive and Halycon Core and ""get back out there"".

Doubling up as a life sim, there is over 250 square kilometers of playable space and although the ultimate objective of the main story campaign is to repair Nero - your ship - multiple hiccups appear along the way and there are many side missions and tasks.

Although set in an alternate future 2050s where space travel is ""just about as normal and ubiquitous as air travel"", Houston ""looks pretty much the same"" and it is not unusual to see people driving around in vehicles which are decades-old, as the State of Texas managed to avoid signing up to the Common Climate Agreement which would have effectively seen vehicles built before 2029 removed from the streets of Texas entirely.

Much like in Watch Dogs 2 or Star Citizen or Quantum Break or Ghost Recom: Wildlands, the game can be played in third or first person.

Tristan - the main character - whilst once being a ""former rich kid"" whose father was once a high-ranking officer in the UESF, but was cut off from his family - nevertheless has many ""rich friends"" and so has multiple safe houses available to him dotted around the map. He can also purchase and enter properties, but his primary objective is to repair Nero - which is an already very expensive endeavor itself.

Given Houston's grip on the past, you will still find early 21st century businesses dotted across the map, many of which have open interiors, ranging from early 21st Century movie theaters, eateries, burger joints, coffee shops, gas stations, malls and even ""retro-style"" arcades.

Whilst the game features over 120 driveable vehicles and 11 aircraft (only helicopters so far), more vehicles and aircraft - even planes - are planned for a future DLC.

Although the map is already quite sizeable - 250km2 - a planned future DLC plans to add more than 1,100 square kilomters of extra playing space to the existing map, whilst also introducing planes, airports, 17 additional aircraft and 130 additional vehicles, but also comes with new characters and a new story campaign and effectively increases the game's total playable area by nearly 5.5 times.

Sorry this is long, I'm having a lot of issues with my new landlord. 

I ended up connecting with the old tenant from this place, mainly because I went 4 days without hot water due to a broken timer when I first moved in, which my landlord was convinced I broke or didn't set up properly, and wanted me to call the old tenant at 11pm on a work night (she was overseas at time), to prove I had broke it/not set it up correctly, rather than call a plumber. I had to fight for her to come out and the timer was broke. This is one of many issues since I moved in, and I could use some advice. 

- wanted me to pre-agree as they are desperate to fill other room (which is vastly overpriced, I'm only here because my disability support allowance covers it) to pay more on electric because new prospective tenant who hasn't even met me or seen property demanded it prior to viewing. 

- did a viewing on Christmas day, I was away fortunately, then wanted me to interview new prospective tenant on boxing day, guilting me into by saying they helped me out after a break up and I should empathize that this prospective tenant is going through something similar. Again, I refused, as I was with my family/friends for the holidays and had plans that day (requested this on the day) and agreed to call this weekend, now I'm likely going to be blamed that she found somewhere else in that time.

- refused to get a smart meter for the boiler, until I said that I wouldnt take the property if that was the case as she wanted me to work out electrical contributions with new prospective tenant by going over meter readings vs daily activities on a day by day basis. 

- during the viewing, some of my things were knocked over, mud dragged into living room, rug bunched up from getting pulled on doors, so I had to clean when I got back. I am constantly told by landlord how I need to keep it clean, so yeah, coming home to a messy apartment right after Christmas and having to clean it was not fun. 

- charged me for the 10 days of electric before my tenancy started, paid a 3rd of bill as a contribution for higher electricity use when hot water was broke and I had to use boost constantly for hours. Is claiming that the bill is higher due to me not turning off switches and I need to turn boiler off when not in use!? Have been advised by plumber not to do this as can break the components. So basically cut off hot water, which we don't have for most the day anyway, as when it's not on timer it doesn't work. But disregards the charges for the broken timer or me paying for utilities on those extra days. 

- every week since I moved in, there has been some disruption, errand I need to do, visit from her or a family member and it's exhausting because even when she says she'll be quick and not disturb me, she disturbs me. When I'm working, relaxing, or have plans I need to cancel to wait in for a collection of something or workmen. This weekend, she is coming over to collect some of the things she stored in the room, despite being here only a few days ago for the viewing. She is also getting a new bed delivered so not doubt she'll be here again in a few days, or I'll be asked to wait in for the delivery and communicate with the delivery men. 

- the old tenant from the property has stated previous problems for boiler breaking, causing high bills, mice and the landlord putting her on a ""Lodgers"" agreement instead of tenancy (my contract starts just tenancy agreement, so I'm not sure where that falls onto) and found when she moved out, the deposit was withheld and she was charged for plumber visits etc from when the boiler broke. I haven't had a deposit award scheme notification (I got one at my old place) and I am thinking as it's nearly 30 days since I moved in, she is trying to do the same with me. 

- the old tenant had ago at the landlord (sent me screenshots) as even when a plumber confirmed the timer was broke, she still tried to blame me and was slagging me off to her saying she needs to be kinder to her tenants and not always try to point balme.  The old tenant now wants to me for coffee, which I'm assuming is to give me more info/warning on what to expect these next coming months. 

- the property is constantly freezing cold in the day, resulting in me wearing 2/3 layers to keep warm or blasting the electric heater for 30 mins or so.  the landlord refuses to let me put the heating on timer, or show me how to do it because it's ""too expensive"" and the other flats should heat up this one. 

I have a 6 month break clause, so I've got 5 months here now. I have mobility issues, so as long as I am able to physically, I intend to break the contract at the 6 month clause unless things vastly improve with this landlord or my health stays poor. 

Does anyone have any advice please? How can I best navigate the next 5 months? She's coming over again this morning, and I'm sick, in pain and CBA with it. But I also don't feel like I should have to leave the property I'm paying for because she's likely going to be moaning at me and blaming me for the tenant dropping out due to me being busy on boxing day and not able to call. (The rooms are rented separately for context, so it's not like the benefits for me are massive for securing a roommate, although I would like one, it's pretty lonely here post breakup).

1hos109,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/1hos109/when_things_go_wrong/,When Things Go Wrong,"Scullery duty for Mason and me aboard ship was finally over, thank God.  It had been rough. 

Especially when we’d hit heavy seas.  The old rust bucket we were on was an amphibious assault ship with an interior well deck that could be flooded at will to accommodate landing craft.  

And it had wallowed like a pig.  Trying to keep up
with dirty messware constantly coming in had been a nightmare.  Added to that were the frequent instances of a “diner” not reacting quickly enough when the ship rolled badly to port or starboard.  Don’t move quickly enough to grab your tray, and it’d slide off the table onto the deck.  And of course someone would occasionally throw up.  We had then to briefly pause operations from time to time to clean up those messes, too.  

Then there was the scullery itself.  Someone in faulty wisdom had decreed that, though the trays were composite plastic and unbreakable, the crockery of plates and cups were of shatterable stoneware.  

The shelving against one bulkhead where just-cleaned items were placed had horizontal thin metal bands set low to help them On the shelves when the ship would take a roll.  

In more gentle seas these proved sufficient.  But they weren’t up to the task in the seas we found ourselves in.  

Roll to port, and we’d feverishly wash as many times as we could.  

Roll to starboard, and we’d both quickly abandon that activity.  Then hurry through inches of dirty water from a faulty floor drain to press ourselves spreadeagle against the shelving to try to keep as much crockery as we could from falling out onto the awash deck.  It was a losing battle.  

Then when the exhaust fan had broken down, the scullery was constantly full of billowing clouds of hot steam that would drift out from the scullery onto the mess deck.  This was increasingly difficult to breath in when the temperature in the scullery them constantly varied from 110 to 115 degrees. 

Our solution then was a simple one born of necessity.  One of us would continue washing until he couldn’t take it anymore. Then would rush through the open hatchway (don’t trip over the coaming) onto the mess deck as the other went back inside to take his place for as long as He could stand it.  Then hands on knees try to catch his breath in incrementally cooler clearer air until he had to go back in again; kept trading off.  We were working all day in a sauna.  

Slops from incoming trays, and broken crockery, went into metal trash cans lined with thick clear plastic bags.  In the brief respites between meals, the collected tied-shut bags we’d slice a hole in so they’d sink, and throw them overboard.  

When we teacher territorial waters, though, we were no longer permitted to do this.  Consequently, the full bags were stacked along both bulkheads along the passageway leading to the mess deck until they could again be disposed of.  We had no other place to put them. They eventually grew to waist and then chest height.  

With ship’s crew and a full complement of Marines aboard, we were working continually, with only a brief break between each meal to wolf down some food ourselves, quaff down as much coffee as we could in the time allotted, and lay our heads on folded arms on the table for a few minutes’ rest. 

Wait time to eat in a long kind stretching down the length of the passageway averaged about two hours.  All that time looking at days’ worth of accumulated rancid slops in clear plastic bags stacked along both bulkheads.  Which turned More stomachs queasy, lol.  

But finally it was over.  Only because we’d begin to conduct amphibious landings in the morning, being now off the coast of Korea.  

The two senior corporals in the platoon tried to do 
Two of us a favor, lol.  They suggested to our Plt Sgt Hardass, as we sat sick and miserable in the berthing area:  “These two ain’t lookin’ too good, boss.”  (We weren’t - swear we’d both lost weight).  

“We could give ‘em a couple days to recuperate here aboard ship, then have ‘em helo’d out to rejoin the unit.”

“And have ‘em miss all the fun?!  Oh, Hell no!  We got a long walk ahead of us after we land.  LONG walk.  Whaddaya say, OP?”

“Bite me, you hillbilly sonofabitch.”

A laugh, a clap on the shoulder for me, and “That’s the spirit, Marine!  Ooh-rah!”  

The landings went off on schedule the next morning.  With bad omens from the start.  

The well deck of the ship was flooded for the first of the landing craft to depart it.  Thereafter a dry deck was used.  For succeeding waves, the Mike boats returning to take on more troops would pull up to within reach of the welldeck opening and lower their ramp.  A simple matter then of stepping from the now dry unflooded well deck onto the lowered ramp of the Mike boat and move to take your place in the open boat.  A gap of about a foot of deep water between the two.  

And Shelby lost his rifle.  He didn’t have the sling correctly done, it came Undone, his rifle skipped from his shoulder, into the gap, and “ka-splooch!”into the ocean it went.  

I stepped past a stricken Shelby with a glance at the horror written on his features.  He was gonna have to try to explain this.  “Better you than me, pal”, I thought.  “Better you than me.”  A bad omen, when we were just getting started.

When the ramp of our Mike boat eventually dropped off the beachhead, there were more.  Jumping off of the sides of the lowered ramp, ax we’d been trained, we discovered that the water was deeper right there than expected.  Loaded down with weapons, full kit, and the added weight of cold weather gear (Korea in the wintertime), guys were stumbling in waist and chest deep water and going under.  Like when you take a step off of a step only to discover that  the drop is more than you’d expected. 

And some, weighted down as they were, were having difficulty finding their feet again.  I took a dunking myself (which was an eye-opener in the frigid water), but managed to stand back up again.  And along with some others, start helping those who were still trying to. 

Except for Bowdry.  Against instruction, he’d gond off the end of the ramp.  And now floundered  and went himself just as an incoming surge lifted and carried the idling boat forward. 

The Coxswain had seen the difficulty we in the water were having, and had leapt into the water with us.  Where he was also helping pull floundering Marines to their feet and giving them a shove in the direction of dry ground. 

Seeing what was about to happen, he gave a shout, and was close enough to reach Bowdry quickly, grab him by his pack straps, and by sheer strength hurl him to the side just before the front of the lowered ramp scraped against the shingle. 

Bad omens two and three.  

We’d quickly formed up on the beach in defensive deployment, then began moving inland through a thin screen of trees.  

Less than an hour later, we received word that not everyone had made it.  One of the ‘tracks had taken on water and sunk in deep water on the way in.  They were amphibious, and designed to not only operate on dry land, but float, as well.  But now and then one didn’t.  

Buttoned up inside, no one had made it out or survived the sinking.  Marines from another Company within the battalion, with whom we’d worked time and again.  Eight lost before we’d even made it to the beach.  

The worst of omens.

This is my first time posting, so sorry if it is a little messy with the timeline and it will be long. This story will also mention suicide and abandonment. I (23 M) have a friend (20 M), I’ll call him Lincon. Like the title says, we have been friends for 10 years, and this is accounting from when we were acquaintances to best friends. We had good times and bad, but it always felt like we had each other. At least, that’s how it felt to me. We met each other in Boy Scouts. He was a high–energy kid, could not sit still, and was always talking. I’ll be honest, it annoyed me a lot back then. But as we got older we both changed and after one camp out we became friends. Our friendship grew and we became closer. Since we had weekly meetings, we could only see each other, in person, once a week and not much in the texting department. 

The time our friendship started to shift into something closer, was when I was in my senior year in high school and he was in his freshman year. Being in the same school we ended up hanging out with each other a lot. Our friend groups mixed well, but in hindsight, it may have been different in actuality. We talked, via text, a lot this year, outside of school. We would pick an anime and watch it separately, come back, and talk about it. We would geek out about our interests like music, analysis, cartoons, etc. It was a stressful time in my life thinking about the future with college and what my degree would be, but I always made time for the things I deemed important in my life, and this included him. The highlight of this year, which will always have a special place in my heart, was our band trip to California. We were going out there to compete with our concert band and were very excited. We came up with a plan to get a room to ourselves for the duration of the trip. No, this is not the type of high school, teenage shenanigans, we were just trying to have a bed to ourselves. Once there, we hosted a movie night in our room for our friends, where he and I had a great laugh since they had never seen me with my glasses and what was happening in the movie. I was ready to jump onto the other bed and cover his mouth since he almost spoiled the movie several times if I hadn’t cut him off. After we competed, we went to Disneyland the next day. I am very much a Disney person, so he was asking me for advice and recommendations the whole time leading up to the trip. We ended up going around the park together, with one other person that we didn’t want to leave alone, but he wanted to know anything and everything. That made me very happy since not many people liked to talk about Disney too much. Then, the next day we went to Universal Studios since it was not too far away and we fundraised enough to pull it off. It was just the two of us that day and we explored. He saw me at my most vulnerable moment when the Forbidden Journey ride restraints would not go far enough. After I did the walk of shame to the test seat (again) and got the 3 clicks (again), he gave the final push for me to ride. He never looked at me any differently afterward, which meant the world to me, Especially since I have always had problems with my body image. This was after we went through the Walking Dead attraction where, because of a chainsaw-wielding zombie, he fell and my fight or flight made me choose to fight, almost punching on reflex. After I caught myself, I helped him up and we continued. So this was our attempt to calm down our elevated heart rate. To this point, my parents never understood how I was friends with him comparing his behaviors at our Scout Meetings. However, my mom was a chaperone on the trip to California, and we were in her group. She was shocked seeing how much he had matured and how he acted outside of that setting. But the thing that made this trip seem like our relationship had begun to change was when we went on the Revenge of the Mummy and he grabbed onto me when we were at the point where “bugs” started crawling on us. Granted, this could have been a reflex, but still. 

The year ended where it was gonna. I graduated and high school was officially over. I chose the safer option and went to our local college, but it had a great program in my degree and I already knew a fair bit of the music staff. Since I was still in town we still hung out and talked regularly. Then the dreaded time of 2020 hit. We went full remote and that was our new life. This is where we got closer, but where I started to see some cracks in hindsight, I will get to those in this section. Since it was the time of Quarantine, we could not meet in person or go out. However, we talked almost daily, and sometimes the whole day. When the summer hit we would be on a Google Meet call for hours. Our record was 8 am to 6 am. Yes, this was into the next day. These were not continuous since we took breaks, lunch, dinner, etc. We would talk to each other as we each did our own thing. Me: writing, reading, drawing. Lincon: gaming, reading, doomscrolling. We would also watch things at the same time. So it was a distanced movie night. Now for those cracks. Looking back on it now, I do find these odd since I did not know of this at the time. He and “our friends” would play Among Us fairly often. This was the game they played the most, from what I was told. It bugged me then, but they did not need to invite me, I thought. It would be nice, but there was nothing that said I had to be involved. Mind you, I thought these friends also liked me. I tried to stay in touch, but you can’t really grow a relationship from a one-sided conversation. Yet, when we were in person I thought we got along great. I’ll never know why this was the case since he never told me, I wasn’t gonna force him, but he said he’d bring it up to them on their next game night. But nothing ever came of that. I didn’t think much of it at the time, I just felt a little hurt but they do not need to invite me to play with them if they don’t want to. That was their choice. 

	The next school year, our long calls disappeared, but it was the same habits and patterns. We chatted often, even during our vacations, and used each other as an escape. The most notable thing that happened this year was when I found out I was gay. He had been openly gay for years at that point, so I went to him for some advice and other friends I had who were also LGBTQ+. That is a long story on its own, but he was a large support. We also made a pact or two after that time, but nothing important. Those silly things that friends make with each other like marriage, best man, etc. This also seemed to bring us closer, and he started opening up to me about more of his crushes and wanted my advice, though I established to not ask about attractiveness since…well…I was an adult and he was still in high school. 

	The next year was when things felt like we were at our closest, though not the best for Lincon. I will not talk about his personal life since I only know what he’s told me and I want to respect his privacy. The only thing I will mention is that he started using alcohol and weed more heavily than in the past. I did not know what was going on in his personal life, but I was not gonna inquire about if he didn’t want to share. I also established that I did not want to know about his friends since they did not want to be mine, and I’d rather not know since I put in all the effort I could and they did not. I was the definition of that one person who hangs out with the group because they’re friends with one person in it. He mentioned that his friend group was becoming known as the stoner group, and I asked if that was what he wanted. As long as he was careful and did not abuse the substances, I was not gonna make a big deal out of it. I’m not his parents and I would step in if it escalated, which it did. One night he sent me a picture of a glass filled with bleach telling me, “I wanna drink this, who’s miss me anyway.” I tried calling him immediately, but he wouldn’t pick up. His parents wouldn’t pick up. I was also not sure who I would call, not knowing that 911 would have been a good place to start, but I also was out of town at the time, so I couldn’t just drive over. I found out a few hours later that he was ok, he was just at a not-good point in his life that he did not tell me about. We talked for hours and he told me he sent that to all of his friends, and that I was one of two that replied. The other was his crush, who wanted to analyze his feelings in the moment. Red flag, no, that is not the time! Luckily they did not become a couple. Also, one of two people. What does that tell you about your other “friends”? That was just an observation I had at the time, and I was a little mad at these individuals. Plus, this was also where he admitted he had a band with some of his friends and also had others over to his house. Ok, a band, fine. I’m not gonna have any feelings toward that. Was I a little hurt, sure. But maybe they don’t need a brass player. But to this point, I had only been on the outside of his house and we hung out around the town and in my car. Strange, but hey, to each their own I guess. My house is always messy, so I never extended the offer either. He graduated this year, but I do not know if he had a graduation party and if he did, I was not invited. But I chose to believe he didn’t have one. 

To this point, each year has been a paragraph, but I’m gonna squish two together. We had started to talk less, but when we talked, it never felt like time had passed. He got his Eagle Scout. At the time, most did not think he was gonna get it, but I never had doubt. He always came to me for advice since I had earned mine years prior. At his Eagle Court of Honor, I gave a speech about how I knew he could do it, despite others doubting. I was told barely anyone heard it, but what mattered to me was that he did, as I was holding back tears in the moment. He also awarded me my first Eagle Mentor Pin, though he didn’t have them at the time and I still haven’t got it. He started community college to wind down from high school and to still be doing something in between leading to college. This is probably a good place to mention that his parents also really liked me. At his court of honor, his mom said I need to visit them more often and join them for dinner, I even offered to cook it if she’d like. Also, trusting me to take him to some of our community service outings where there is little to no reception and in the mountains. Even asking me to keep him out later while things…calmed down at home. Not gonna lie, I was starting to wonder if his parents wanted us to get together at this point. We got each other gifts from our respective vacations. Then I was getting him things from my internship at Disney World, and did my best to stay in touch. Needless to say, he was always on my mind. I did consider him my best friend, after all. Before I left, I made sure to hang out as much as possible and see him in person before I left. Also, I would like to add that he had admitted to me how he feels about me as a friend. He told me that I make him feel safe, that he can turn his brain off and he can say anything and though I may laugh I won’t judge him, that time disappears in the best way. When I got back, he told be that he was planning to go to another university in state. To this point, I thought he was coming to our local college. A part of me was sad, but I was very excited for him. I didn’t know when this decision was made, but all I asked for him was to meet up in person before he left. The day came and I told him I may be late since my card got hacked the day before, but as I’m sitting in the bank at the time we were supposed to meet he told me that he couldn’t meet anymore. He said his parents wanted to spend as much time with him as possible before he left. I understood, but I would have been fine with a few minutes. As long as I could see him and say goodbye, plus give him a hug. He did not seem to understand why I wanted to see him in person so bad, but I dropped it. He did say we could call later that night, but he never called. I did give him the times I’d be available. I had also completely cleared my schedule to spend as much time together as possible. Same thing happened when he was home for winter break. Canceling last minute and only talking over Instagram messages. But I noticed something had changed. Time felt like it had past. And things had changed. He asked me about some of my writing projects and I didn’t want to tell him about it, when before I would tell almost every detail. Even the one we were cowriting together, until I discontinued it. He wasn’t home for Spring Break, instead taking a trip to NYC with his friends. I can’t be mad about that itself. What got me mad was when he said Instagram is not notifying him of my messages. 

Now we’ve gotten to the last year. This past school year, I graduated from college with my three degrees. From what happened during Sping Break and his excuse of Instagram not notifying him had gotten old to me. I was at the end of my rope. I could say we were not as close as we were. I sent him an invatation to my graduation party, to extend the offer. He replied saying his finals were the next week. I knew that since my college doesn’t observe most government holidays, we get out earlier. He did say he’d love to hang out this past summer though. Unfortunately, we had a tragedy in the family, my cousin commited suicide. None of us know what happend and will never know. I had to be a big support for my mom, grandma, and aunt. My mom helped raise him when he was young, my other cousin could not be the support my aunt needed, and of course my grandma if she needed anything since my other cousins aren’t the most reliable. Once things calmed down, I messaged him and explained the situation but left that part for explaining in person. He didn’t read it until time had come for him to go back. That was the last straw for me. This August, I sent him a message detailing all my feelings. I’ll attach the text below. 

“Ok, this isn't gonna be easy for me to say or do, but it's been something I've put off for too long. Honestly, I'd prefer to say all this face to face rather than this. I feel like we both deserve that, but here we are.

I don't know what to do anymore. I miss you, and I miss what we used to be. I don't know what to do. I've been as patient and understanding as I could be, and I feel like I'm just as much to blame with how this has happened. I can tell that you've been ignoring me. Yeah, Instagram not notifying you is a reason but not an excuse. You can still see the icon in the corner. My last message has sat unread for a month, yet I know you've been active on here. I turned off my status years ago for personal reasons regarding my mental health, but I casually turned it on to see you were active not long ago or at the same time. I have been patient and made up excuses. ""He's adjusting to university life, he's busy with school work, he's working, etc."" I am in no way saying I have any obligation to be in or a part of your life. That is a decision you make. Yes, I definitely could've been better at that. I can own up to that. I could've sent more messages, but I never wanted to be overbearing or annoying. In the past, others have found it a nuisance, and I didn't want to be a bother or make you dislike me from that. Honestly, I don't know where our relationship took this turn. We were so close for years. How long did we spend talking to each other regularly just a few years ago? We've been a part of each other's lives for most of it, and we've been friends for a decade now. You told me that, ""I made you feel safe, that you felt more relaxed with me. That you could turn your brain off and not have to think. That you always felt like you were wanted."" Honestly, that still hasn't changed. I still do want you to be in my life, but with these actions, I don't know. I don't have all the information, I don't have the points of view, I'm forced to make my own conclusions based on what I have seen and what actions have shown me. I feel like you don't want me in your life anymore, and I've become an afterthought. In a way, I've fallen into the same pattern I've had in my past, becoming a friend of convenience. I didn't think I was that, at least not always. When you were at one of the lowest points, I was one of two people who were there for you and helped you. I was so scared at that moment because I knew I didn't want to lose you. But I feel like I have. I know you have your own life, and I'm happy for you. I truly am. But from what I've seen, I guess you just don't want me in it. I know there's a chance I'm wrong, but since I don't have the information, I can't create an accurate conclusion. I feel like I've been putting my best foot forward every time. And whenever we try something, it doesn't work out. I've wanted to call you so many times, anything, but I never knew what I'd say, and I don't know your schedule to know when is a good time. I don't know how you feel. All I can do is infer from my past experiences and what you've said in our prior conversations. I can imagine you're stressed. At times, I think you're mad at me. Sometimes, I feel like you just want to be left alone. And I think I'm just not wanted anymore. Relationships change over time, I know that. But I just didn't imagine we'd find ourselves here. I never imagined I've find myself in this position with you. I care about you, I feel like I've emphasized that enough over all this time. I love you. Frankly, I don't even know what kind of love it is at this point. Platonic, familial, maybe romantic, I don't know. I just know you mean the world to me. I don't know whatever it is you may be going through, I can't help make it better and make you feel better. I'm willing to create a fresh start if you are. We can start over. We were always there for each other after all. At least in the best ways we could be. I know I'm not perfect, and I know you definitely know that. But if you'll have me, I'll be here. Things will be difficult, and it'll take work, but there's no reason it can't happen, at least to me. Unless you don't want it. It's up to you at this point. I've made my feelings clear, and whatever decision you make, I'll respect it. To me, at this point, I guess it's the occasional ""Merry Christmas"" or ""hey there"" message. Maybe even a coffee catch up meeting. The only reason I haven't even tried texting is because you told me this is how you preferred to talk and communicate, and I wanted to respect your wishes. If we communicate what we want, the problem can be avoided because we have an understanding. Please, keep this private, or at least not tell people we know mutually it's me with this conversation. I don't want to have to go through that again if it's possible. Whatever decision you make, I just want you to know that you'll always have a special place in my heart. After all, I don't think I could ever hate you. It's you after all, and I love you.

Wow. It's been 3 months, huh, and nothing. Not gonna lie, that really hurts. I guess that shows me where I stand and how much I matter to you. I thought I meant more to you than that, but I guess I was wrong. I love you, but your treatment of me is unacceptable. I will no longer tolerate this, so either respond to me by the end of winter break or I will end our friendship for my own mental health. I wish I knew what changed, but I guess I'll never get that answer. Especially to just be ignored like this for it to end. After all, it's nothing a simple conversation, and some overall communication wouldn't solve.”

We’ve come to now. The message had not been read until the start of this December. Nothing has come from it since. The only thing I know is that I am currently not blocked on Instagram. I am ready to cut him off on January 13th, but I’m also afraid since there will be no going back if I do. The thing that sucks is that I have horrible abandonment issues that stem from my childhood where my old best friend just cut all ties with me out of nowhere, which has affected my friendships now. Yes, he also knows this story. So can you all please give me some help and let me know if I’m the asshole. I will gladly accept your wisdom.

We tried everything but she was more interested in causing arguments and attention seeking by telling people we were keeping LO away and were horrible parents than actually seeing him so enough was enough.  

My mum boasts about how she’d leave me in front of the tv for HOURS and can’t accept that cot bumpers are bad, then wonders why I don’t ask her to babysit. She won’t change nappies if I’m within a half mile radius. If LO cries she tries to take him and if we go and see her she just walks off with him. Rather than support, I get remarks about how “not all recommendations are good” because I don’t feed my 7 month old chocolate, and once I was holding him and she put her hand behind his head like I wasn’t holding my child properly. She never invites us anywhere but wanted to take my baby to a mother and baby group (I’m not back in work yet) and made remarks about how I don’t go anywhere. I do, just with people I feel comfortable with.  

When I was 6 months pregnant, MIL asked my partner to leave me and drive 4 hours to go help her move house (she didn’t help us when we moved) because she decided to buy one. My birth ended with an emergency c section and nobody offered to come and help. We didn’t ask but it was made clear the help we would of had when my mum visited and expected me to make her a coffee and host 8 days afterwards. MIL told her friends she was coming down the day I came out of hospital, we’d changed our minds (entirely fabricated) and she went missing for a few hours so that was great to deal with.

For me, I had this obsession with being a skinny twink. As that's all I was seeing in 🌽, and seeing that they were the group of gays that were treated the best OVERALL in the community. Twinks kinda get treated like how pretty girls get treated in the straight world. We get free drinks, people hitting us up etc. Controversial opinion, that may not be ur reality but it's mine. Anyways, back to what I was talking about.

I've had an ED for about 3-4 years now, i'm now 19 (And 6'0 this is important). And when I started I weighed around 85kg, mostly muscle (from dance) but a little bit of fat over the top because my eating was crap.  
So I started to (and still basically) eat literally nothing. I have around 250 calories everyday. Basically a can of tuna, 1 apple, a cup of black coffee to keep me from passing out everyday and a vape to suppress my apetite.  
My ED is pretty severe now. Like I said previously, I was around 85kg. I have since lost all my muscle and fat. And I weigh like 54kg now.

What sucks is i've never felt worse in my life but i've also never felt sexier.   
(NOT FLEXING) I always get approached in the club, my DMs are flooding with guys who are rlly hot etc. I never had this before, I wasn't big but I wasn't a string bean. 

I just don't know how much longer I can sustain this. I could literally die and the thought of gaining weight and not being a 'twink' anymore would absolutely destroy me...

Why is my body SUCH a big deal to guys interested when I have a really attractive face?  
I just cannot wrap my head around it. This is a bit too much for me.

1horx1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1horx1j/a_thought_that_lingers/,A Thought That Lingers ,"Dear Centauri,

Some days, words come easily, as if my thoughts about you have been waiting, neatly lined up, for their chance to be written. Other days, like today, it’s harder to find the right way to say what’s in my heart. Not because my feelings are any less—they’re constant, like the steady rhythm of my breath—but because it feels impossible to capture something as vast as this love I carry for you in something as small as words.

What I keep coming back to today is this: you linger. In the quiet moments, the in-between spaces of my day, you’re always there. It’s not loud or overwhelming; it’s like a faint melody in the background of everything I do. Whether I’m making coffee in the stillness of the morning or watching the sunset fade into night, there’s always a part of me thinking of you, wondering what your day has been like, what thoughts you might be carrying, what dreams you might be chasing.

It’s strange how someone can feel so present in your life even when they’re far away. You’ve woven yourself into the fabric of my days without even trying, and I don’t think I could untangle you from them even if I wanted to. Not that I ever would. You’ve become a part of me, Centauri, in the way a star becomes part of the night sky—not the whole of it, but the brightest point, the one my eyes always search for first.

I think about what it would be like to tell you these things out loud, to let you see what you mean to me without the safety of these written words. But then I remember that some things are more beautiful in their quietness, in their unspoken truth. Maybe it’s enough that you’ve inspired this part of me, that you’ve awakened something I didn’t know I had—the capacity to feel so deeply, to love so purely, even from a distance.

You’ve taught me that love doesn’t always need to be spoken to be real. It can live in the spaces between words, in the quiet moments of thought, in the way someone becomes the light you look to when everything else feels dark. That’s what you are to me—my light. My constant. My reason to keep writing, to keep dreaming, to keep hoping.

I don’t know what tomorrow will bring, but I know one thing with certainty: you’ll be there, in my thoughts, just as you are now. And that’s enough for me.

Yours, always,

Castor

I’m planning to dive into the world of specialty coffee and could really use some advice. I want to start with the channi (strainer) method and eventually transition to a moka pot.

Here’s what I need help with:

1. Channi Method:

What are the do’s and don’ts for brewing with a channi?

Any tips for achieving a smooth milk-based coffee like lattes or cappuccinos?



2. Coffee Grounds:

Which coffee grounds would you recommend for the channi method?

I’m on a budget and do have access to Credit store, so affordable options would be great.

Any specific roast level or grind size I should look for?



3. Moka Pot Transition:

What should I keep in mind when switching to a moka pot?




I mostly enjoy milk-based coffees, so suggestions tailored to that would be perfect. Looking forward to your insights!

Thanks in advance!

1horw38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1horw38/dilemma_with_friends_and_family_staying_at_my/,Dilemma with friends and family staying at my house from out of town...,"Essentially I live very far away, in an extremely high cost of living and desire tourist destination. So, for most friends and family staying at my house is a necessity or they'd never be able to afford to visit. 

I understand that they can't afford it, and so I do allow people to stay with me even though I hate it, because they wouldn't be able to visit ever otherwise and while I do hate people staying IN my house, I do like seeing people I care about and being able to give them the opportunity to visit paradise at a price they can afford. So I'm willing to make sacrifices for those I love. 

The issue is, people really can't comprehend what a sacrifice I'm making and they can't empathize with my needs. 

The thing is, I typically only socialize for a few hours at a time and only maybe twice a month. I have very strict routines, a very low social and sensory battery, and live a quiet simple solitary life. 

I also live in a very small house with my husband and 4 pets, I do not have a guest bedroom, there's only 1 bathroom. 

I try very hard to explain my situation and my boundaries and yet it almost just never works out.

It seems like everyone just needs so much more for me than I have to give and honestly takes my neurodivergence way way to fucking personally. 

Apparently, you're supposed to at least somewhat enjoy hosting, but honestly why the fuck would I enjoy never being able to properly decompress, constantly having to be perceived, having zero control over my only safe place in the world, people constantly making a mess and having clutter, having to wait to use my own bathroom, having to mask whether I feel like it or not, not being able to use my space the way I'd like to, my indoor cat being let out multiple times a day, having to tip-toe around other people's feelings, and struggle to accommodate others needs in my own home when I already struggle to meet my own... 

Mornings and evenings are exceptionally difficult - typically I need a few hours before and after socializing to prepare myself mentally and decompress respectfully. With company there is no ability to do that, you can't even pour a cup of coffee without having to socialize.

I personally feel like a prisoner in my own home when I have guests, save for a few who REALLY understand me and I really can just go about my life with VERY minimal impact - these people tend to be independent, introverted themselves, and possibly some version of neurodivergent. 

Today was my first day waking up without company after 5 days of company. When I first woke up I had this horrible feeling of anxiety and dread and then I remembered ""oh yeah no one is here"" I went to my kitchen in my underwear, hair a mess, sat at my table and had a warm cup of coffee, watched the colorful sunrise out my window, the only sound was that of birds chirping, grabbed a blanket and laid on my couch and read for a while.. Was the most peace I'd felt in days. 

I also notice my pets and my husband are noticeably happier, 2 of my pets are shy and my husband is also an introvert. 

I feel terrible, but the hardest part is the lack of appreciation and consideration. Because they just can't fathom that having to socialize when your social battery is drained, or having your routines and lifestyle totally upended might be, i dont know stressful??

My pug is turning 11 in a couple months. She and I are coming up on our 10 year anniversary together in October 2025. I adopted her from my dad.

I fear that she's getting dementia because of the following changes:

• Less responsive to her name and commands. I know her hearing is fine, because I can whisper ""treats"" or ""hungry"" and she can hear her favorite words being whispered

• Frequent poops in the house

• Random barks at nothing

• Grown more clingy. I can not have a moment sitting alone in my house anymore. She constantly wants to be in my lap. (I do welcome this, I want her to be happy and comfortable, but sometimes I do roll my eyes because I just want a moment sitting alone without being touched sometimes. I miss when she used to feel content just laying in her giant dog bed on her own sometimes)

• Lastly, this is the most alarming to me: she just randomly wanders off by herself sometimes. She NEVER used to do this. Sometimes by a rare chance, sit down to watch a movie or something, and she DOESN'T immediately climb into my lap, I find her sitting alone on my dark hallway, or sitting alone under my dining room table, hanging her head low and just...staring. I'll usually go pick her up and carry her to where I'm sitting and she'll settle in my lap.

(All of these symptoms are met with patience. I understand she's getting older and I don't scold her for any of these behaviors. Sometimes I get a little impatient when I have to call her a million times to get her out of a room, but that's about it. I try to stay patient and I never scold)

I plan to talk to my vet about this very soon. Does this sound like dementia though? Is it worth asking about selegiline at this point in the process?

I also adopted a second dog 2 years ago, and I worry so much and have so much guilt over splitting my attention between 2 dogs, when my pug used to be an only child and got ALL the attention. These feelings are flaring up again as I watch my elderly pug go through these changes. Is this rational??

On the bright side, there's a lot of things that are still normal! My elderly pug still gets SUPER excited for food, treats and car rides. She still gets excited when I come home from work most of the time (sometimes I catch her right out of a nap, like she doesn't hear my car coming up the driveway. Then she just seems shocked when I come in lol). She still loves a squeaky toy. Still occasionally gets into trouble, like occasionally jumping onto the coffee table looking for snacks. She still recognizes me, my partner, my family, and dogs she's met before.",1,1735461281.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

My name is Samantha, and I recently moved to the PNW (Portland area) for a new job. I am looking to meet my best friend turned boyfriend :)

Fun Facts About Me:

🎵🎷 I graduated with my music ed degree, play saxophone and sing!

☕️🍣 I love sushi, chain restaurants, and coffee. My go-to order is an iced vanilla dirty chai latte.

🍿📺 I like watching movies (thrillers/romcoms) and the same tv shows over and over (dance moms, glee, good girls, etc.) 

👩🏻‍💻🩵 I work full time for a small business in inventory and fulfillment.

I am 5’1” on a good day and plus sized. I am looking for a serious relationship, so if you’re are only looking for NSFW chats, I am not for you. I am interested in chatting online for a bit (on Reddit only) and then meeting up in person once comfortable. 

I do believe that my love languages are quality time, words of affirmation, and physical touch (which I rarely share because I feel that leads to sexual pressures!)

I am trying something new and scary by trying to find people to talk to, but I also want to be upfront about my own relationship hindrances. I come from a place with a lot of family baggage and trauma that causes a lot of self esteem issues. I experience a lot of anxiety in relationships and am treated for depression. I also have very little dating experience and no sexual experience due to my religious upbringing.

About you:
* Preferably between 23-32 years old and in the area (within reason)
* Masculine leaning or male. I tend to go for mountain men (tall, dad bod/bulky build and beard), but I’m open to all figures and ethnicities :) 
* Kind, PATIENT, and a good communicator
* Please have your own form of transportation (I have a car, but have always preferred being passenger)

If you feel like you vibe with me, message me a little about yourself, including your age, location, and a little selfie. I look forward to meeting you 😊

April 30

I’ve come across a question I’m afraid to ask. 

The answer might cast a light on what I’d rather not see. Things I always chalked up to bad luck or just the way things are. I often noticed that my memories seemed out of place, or slightly off. It always seemed like it all could be traced back to the coma, like drops of blood combining at the edge of a drain. 

The moment that fractured everything. When recalling any memory became as difficult as seeing through a shattered window. I write this here because I feel like I can’t trust myself to remember anymore. I write this here because I could hardly ever read my own handwriting, a problem that makes the question ever harder to solve. 

The question, like a scream in the dark down the hall on a peaceful night, is unwelcome. I wonder if I should just close my eyes and wait, and hope I’d never registered it at all.
 
The question.

Why can’t I remember writing The Abandoned House?


May 1

I’ve realized I need to share everything here. I’m not sure if I’ll remember everything the way it really happened if I don’t. Or if it won’t make sense when I do. 

I almost thought it was an April Fool’s joke at first. At the premiere of a film based on a story I’d made, The Burn Pit, one fan stopped me not to ask for an autograph or for my opinion on how they’d butchered the ending. She looked at me with a pair of bright green eyes that seemed to shine as she asked, “I’ve always wondered, what happened at the end of The Abandoned House, really?” 

I couldn’t help but pause. Occasionally, someone gets a title wrong, slightly altering a word or two in something I’ve written. But this title brought nothing. I felt like I was peering out into a wall of fog as I searched for any hint of it. I told her it wasn’t one of mine, and her expression drifted into something more than disappointment. Something close to resentment. 

She wandered off, yet the question lingered with me. The title, The Abandoned House. It felt like something I’d write. It was like finding an old picture you’re in and being shocked you can’t place what, when, or where it was. I felt that place in the back of my mind begin to work, synapses firing and connections forming. The feeling when a new story is forming, already beginning to fight its way out. 

A quick search on my phone as I left the theater while walking to my car left me frozen in place. There on the internet movie database was the title The Abandoned House, released September 23, 1997.

And beside screenplay, my name. Matthew Rook. 

May 2
I woke up last night dripping sweat. I haven’t had a chance to look up anything else. Or maybe I haven’t had the courage. But this story keeps clawing at the corners of my mind. Normally, I’d never hold back that wonderful burst of inspiration. But this is different. I had to write something, and this is what I found on the screen after an hour of furious typing. 

The Abandoned House

Loneliness is not found when no one is around. It comes when you realize there's not enough left of you to share if there was. 

Pale amber light pours in from one of the holes where the roof had admitted defeat, a beam glistening across a cracked bottle. The structure bends and creaks in the wind now, begging for the day it will be overwhelmed.

A black rain begins to trickle down from above, heavens weeping now at what they saw. The mold metastasizing throughout the walls gleefully drank and continued to creep into every corner.

Once, laughter had filled the walls that now only harbored the blackest moss. Arguments had stained the air, drifting into cold silence that would seem searing compared to the state it was in now. The growth had infected the smallest room, worst of all, infiltrating the yellow paint and gradually overtaking the crib in the corner. It had never been touched after the day the laughter died.

I am what remains.

I am a shadow in the dark. The last gasp of a scream no one ever heard. A hand that cannot hold. A memory of a dream dissolving into dawn.

I am what remains in the husk of a home no one could live in.

Far too late, I realize there's not enough left to save. 

This isn’t how I normally write. But this is what has bubbled to the surface. Now that I’ve shaken it loose, I’m going back to sleep. Maybe tomorrow I’ll look this movie up. 


May 3
I tried not to look it up. I thought about just waiting for the memory to fade, like a trail that hadn’t been walked on enough. But the story kept appearing in that space just behind my mind. Growing and changing. I had to know if I was dreaming up something new or just remembering an old story. 

It’s hard to recall anything from that time. I’m clean now, but before the accident I feel like days at a time vanished into the bright light a line of coke would spark in my mind. Entire stories often appeared on my old Macintosh, and some I look back on and cringe. It wouldn’t have been the first screenplay. I helped make that awful werecat movie a reality after all. It shouldn’t matter. It doesn’t matter. 

But I caved. After a quick search, I came back across the IMDb page reminding me it came out September 23, 1997. Just months before everything changed. But the results abruptly ended there. No streaming platforms listed, not one link to watch online. Nothing showed on Netflix, Amazon, or any cult movie sites. Not even a bootleg YouTube with potato quality. No age old used DVD or VHS copies floating around. 

All I could find were a few mentions on fan forums and an article from an archived GeoCities page calling it an “uneven, haunting gem with an ending that is what you make of it.” A few mentions of how impossible it was to find. I eventually switched back to IMDb and scanned the rest of the credits.

The director had died in 2003. Not one actor from the three main cast had filmed another movie. The database didn’t even have headshots for them. It felt like the entire project had come and gone, like an eclipse. 

The only name I could recognize was Elliot Grayson, the producer. I’d worked with him a few times in the mid 2000s, before any of my stories really started making money in Hollywood. He’d been professional but distant. He preferred to say as little as possible, and I remembered liking that. 

I’m leaning back in my chair, trying to recall something I don’t think ever happened while resisting my imagination’s call to arms. My heart was pounding, but I couldn’t say why. It feels like I’m trying to recall someone else’s half-forgotten dream the next day. 

Why can’t I remember writing it? And why do I feel so afraid of finding out? 

May 3
 
I can’t sleep anymore. I wake up and the story screams behind my eyes, begging me to work on it. Some part of me almost hopes I can finish this draft before I do find the movie, so I can see which turned out better. I found myself typing this morning, cold coffee sitting beside me only growing colder.
 
This is what I’ve made so far.
 
The Abandoned House
 
The bottle slipped from his hand across the filth covered floor, rattle echoing through empty walls. For a moment, his hazel eyes fell on it and searched for shards of shattered glass. Then he laughed—a hollow, rasping sound that fell off the peeling paint throughout the home.
 
Of course it didn’t. He thought to himself, though he could not place what that made it so funny.
 
He hauled himself to his feet, swaying as the room began to tilt. A layer of grime cushioned every footfall, the accumulated decay a soft and strangely comforting. The flickering lights offered little clarity, sputtering in and out of existence like a memory just out of reach.
 
He fought through unsteady steps as long as he could until one foot landed wrong. The fall knocked the air from his lungs, but the impact did not feel the way it should have. Instead, the weight of the house pressed in on him as he laid on his side—the damp rot, the stale air, the relentless quiet. He laughed again, the sound sharper this time. He searched the floor for his phone, though he knew there was no one he could call.
 
Nobody would answer. Not for him.
 
A gust of wind cut through the room, unexpected frigid air kicking up dust and debris as it squeezed in through every broken window and crack in the walls. He squinted into the dimness, trying to pinpoint its source. He told himself he would check tomorrow, though it was another lie.
 
The fridge groaned, a low, mournful sound that echoed through the kitchen. He was not sure why, but the interruption left him started. He shuffled toward it, fumbling inside and pulling out the one thing it still offered. Another drink.
 
He unscrewed the cap and tossed the plastic over his shoulder, unbothered when it came to rest silently. The whiskey burned his throat in a way that felt familiar, almost comforting. He sank into a corner of the room, shadows embracing him like an old friend.
 
Kyle closed his eyes and tried to remember how he had ended up like this. For what felt like hours, he sifted through dead memories, though none of them seemed to fit. The house creaked and groaned around him, alive in ways he could not be. When he opened his eyes again, the illusion of warmth was gone.
 
Leaves drifted through the shattered windows, dancing through the otherwise still air. The fridge door hung open, its insides empty and silent. The bottle in his hand was dry now, though he did not remember drinking the last.
 
All that remained now was the house.
 
Sitting back, I stare at the name the longest. I usually labor over them, struggling to find the one that sounds right. That has some personal meaning that isn’t too obvious. But like the rest of this story, it simply appeared.
 
It’s like I can’t stop it.

May 5
I spent all yesterday sleeping, lost in a dark and twisting adventure behind my eyes that I can’t recall. Like so many things. I think the sleep did me well. I felt so worn down and ragged the last few days. All I had done was write a bit, and yet it felt like I was on the verge of collapse.

 This morning, I shot an email to the producer on the film, Elliot Grayson. Our last communique was over a decade ago working on an adaptation of one of my more action focused stories. The movie itself turned out well. But from what I recall, it almost felt like he spent the production avoiding me. Looking over our emails, it seems like he always waited as long as possible to answer. Most producers I work alongside now are eager for any insight or detail, often if only to paint the production an air of legitimacy.

That’s why I was all the more surprised when he fired back an answer not two hours later. He said The Abandoned House was a small, indie production I hold sold the rights to for next to nothing. He said he’d asked why and had told him I didn’t like the idea enough to make it a novel. When he asked, I had told him it had turned out fine, but I simply didn’t like making it.

I wonder if I had that same feeling as I do now, of the story threatening to tear its way out if I did not commit it to a page in time. To find some use for it. He finished by saying unfortunately he didn’t have a copy, and the movie had sold so poorly it had never even seen a reprint after a first VHS run, no doubt after a few of my other works took off. He wasn’t even sure who held the rights now.

I sent one question back, asking if he could remember the story of the movie. It shouldn’t have surprised me when no answer came. For some time, I tried to connect the things he had said to what memories I could exhume.

It’s so hard to remember anything from that time. I had in the past chalked it up to the cocktail of drinks and drugs I’d blamed all my creativity on. I made a lot of poor choices back then. The kind that end with being you found half dead on the side of the highway. Just recalling that road sends a slight shiver down my spine.

 The only one other person I can think to ask about all this never answered the last few times I tried. I really doubt she wants a trip down memory lane because I can’t remember writing some movie.

Maybe a thrift story or the library might have a copy. I think I’ll try tomorrow. I’m not sure why, but I feel tired again.
 
 6 May
 
Amber.

Her name on my phone made the device feel heavier. I couldn’t say what scared me more; if she were to ignore my question or the sound of her voice if she answered. Time seemed to vanish, the clock on my phone leaving me behind. Before I could force a decision, another name replaced her as the dial trilled.
Barry, my agent.

I let out a long breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding and answered the call.

“Matty,” He began without any preamble, accented voice tinged with humor, “I thought I’d have heard from you by now, and gotten all your gripes about what they did to Burn Pit.” I felt my brow furrowing and was surprised to find the premier had been the last thing on my mind lately.

“You thought I’dwith no be mad they cut the teeth scenes.”

“The big wigs said it was too much for audiences to take. They wouldn’t even let the director film the first one for an unrated version, though the second is on film somewhere.” He behind his typical bravado, I almost felt a hint of worry creeping into his voice. I normally would have reached out to him by now if this story hadn’t crashed through my every waking hour since. Regardless, I couldn’t help but ask him, “Hey, we’ve been working together for what, almost twenty years, right?” 

His response was uncharacteristically unsure. There was a brief pause. “I mean, yeah. In that ballpark. Is uh, everything okay Matt?”

I already knew he had no answers, but asked anyway, “Did you ever see The Abandoned House? I wrote its screenplay before we started working together.”

To my surprise, Barry answered, “Yeah, I caught part of it on TV back in the 90s. Honestly? I didn’t really get it. I thought you just wanted a quick buck.”
“What was it about?”

Another pause, longer this time. The silence buzzing in my ear growing into a roar until he recanted, “Uhh… I didn’t finish it, sorry. I had a lady friend coming over. But it had some guy stuck in a house. A ghost maybe? Mysterious as hell, and then I got a bit distracted. If you want, I can try to find you a copy.”

“Yeah, that’d be great. Thanks Barry.”

He didn’t press for any details. Instead, he shifted into mentioning our editor was excited to see the next draft of the black hole story. I mumbled a lie that I’d send it soon and hung up to find her name still on the screen waiting for me.

Amber.

Memories seeped through my mind despite every attempt to keep them at bay. For years, she was the only person willing to put up with me. She worked two jobs back when my early books barely made a dent, and yet we had been happy barely scratching by. When things changed and money became no issue, she just kept working anyway. Said she couldn’t sit around and watch me write all day.

She was patient at first. Even when I disappeared for hours at a time on long dark roads with my mind abuzz from whatever I could get my hands on. But in time, the stories I was writing were overtaking me, the same ones she had fought so hard to let me make. The more I wrote, the less of me there was left to offer.
After the accident, her kindness faded. She often implied I wasn’t the man she’d married. It’s not fair to blame her. I never acted in violence, but I took every ounce of pain and withdrawal out on her. Even my memory, or lack of it.

For a while, she was patient. Understanding that being in a coma for a month may leave someone with memory loss, but it was worse than that. I wasn’t just healing, but struggling to escape the whirlpool of withdrawal. She came to believe I simply lied to her any time I couldn’t remember something.
It ended on a Friday night. She said I’d forgotten our anniversary, though I rudely snapped back it wasn’t until the next week. I should have looked at the calendar. I should have apologized. Instead, I let my anger spill out on her regardless of if she deserved it.

She stared at me for a long time. Then, in a quiet voice, she asked, “Matt, look at me. Can you even tell me where we met?”
I rolled my eyes and quickly answered. “We met at the carnival. James introduced me to you. I asked if you wanted to ride the spinning UFO, and you grabbed my hand when it started.”

Her blue eyes seemed to burn through me as she stared, offering no response. She glanced down at her hands before slowly prying her ring off and setting it on the table. The front door slamming was her last answer.

I’m afraid to ask her. Afraid I don’t deserve an answer. Would her answer change anything? Or would she leave me in silence, like on that Friday night?

May 7
I dreamt of the road again last night.

Wesley Earl Road, an unassuming turn off Transmountain Highway that ends up twisting and turning through the jagged burst of rock that emerged from the desert millions of years ago. I often dream I’m driving down a long, winding road on the edge of a cliff but don’t even recall the name the next day. But last night, it was as clear as the moon hanging in the night sky.

I used to disappear into the jaws of that road for hours at a time, mind reeling from whatever I shouldn’t have taken before getting behind the wheel. Yet no matter how far I drove, my watch and speedometer would always yield little, and eventually I’d lose my buzz and turn around before coming home. I never reached the end, even though one night I’d almost met mine on it.

I always went down the road because no one else seemed to. The road was too narrow in places for two cars despite the yellow divider line in the middle’s claim. What almost felt lie whispered warnings came at the last second, and I often yanked the wheel one way or the other to make a sharp turn when lost in thought. I had some of my best ideas as my car screamed over the road’s cracked pavement, though I couldn’t honestly recall one I’d used in any story.
The road always took more than it gave.

Between serving as an initial pressure point between Amber and I and the promise of danger it eventually kept, I lost a lot out on that road.

A familiar pain in my left leg seeps in as I’m writing this. The familiar sensation, like an old friend, tends to fade with time but never truly abandons me. That place where the bone in my leg bent but somehow didn’t fully break. The abnormal injury that the doctors said was normally only seen in young children had haunted my efforts to learn to walk again after I woke up. I sometimes wonder if a piece of me is still out there, and if I drove back, what I’d find.

I never had gone back after the accident. Never even paid it much thought before The Abandoned House began bleeding back into my life. It occurs to me now that I can’t remember the night of the accident. If I hit something, or swerved off the road to avoid something that shouldn’t have been there.

I pause at that thought. I’m not entirely sure what that could have meant, and I am surprised such an idea appeared. The only thing that shouldn’t have been there that night was me. That I can be sure of.

For now, I’m going back to writing. 

May 7
My head is killing me, but the next page is born. While stopping never felt like a possibility, every paragraph felt like pulling a tooth out with a pair of pliers. I briefly wonder if there was a way to tastefully change the scene in The Burn Pit to allow them to use it. Doesn’t matter now. Writing this feels like an urgent step and yet hours flicker by for only a page to present itself when I’m briefly satisfied.

Can’t think of anything more to say. I can’t remember the last time I wanted a drink more. See below:
 
—-
Sunlight trickled in through the broken, boarded-up windows to cast slivers of golden light that gradually dances across the floor as hours passed until one met his closed eye. He blinked slowly, hazel eyes flecked with flecks of gray, struggling to adjust to the harsh reality that day brought. Now there were no shadows left to blot out the rotting corpse of a beautiful home around him.
 
For a moment he wondered when it had begun to decay, but no answer came.
 
The front door was hanging on by splinters, the lock uselessly set on a barrier that could hardly hold the wind at bay. The ceiling above him on the first floor had succumbed to the weight of water over time, sagging in places that hadn’t already given way to drop chunks of rotted drywall to the floor. Scattered needles and bottles lay about, and he could almost convince himself they weren’t his.
 
Almost.
 
He realized the sight of the home decomposing around him should spark a feeling of abject horror, but despair was his only constant companion. It seemed impossible for anyone to actually live in what was left here and yet, he couldn’t actually recall the last time he’d stepped outside. It felt like he’d always been here, trapped in a forgotten story that no one told.
 
He also felt like he realized all of this before.
 
A gust of wind tore through, whipping the worn pages of an old leather-bound journal resting on an uneven table in the kitchen. He ran his hand over the yellowed pages, feeling for the forgotten words within. He flipped through the diary and was surprised to find all but one page remained empty. On one page he found words scrawled in black in that read, “You have to let her go.” Kyle felt his brow crease at the command, doubting he had written such a message.
 
The answers seemed as lost as his home now.
 
He slipped the journal into his back pocket and turned to face the vestige of a front door. He wondered if he should grab a coat, but let the idea fade away as any time spent within could lead to him losing more time. With a deep breath, he stepped through the ruined doorway out into an alien world kissed by the sun.
 
 May 15
It’s been a few days since I updated anything. I’ve been trying to find things. Going through old photo albums, digging up anything I can in old laptops from that time. It doesn’t help that after the divorce, I put very little thought into preserving the past. I just kept working, convincing myself that if I wrote enough good stories and had enough money that everything would eventually click into place.

But without Amber, it all just felt hollow. I was like a ghost walking through my life, unaware that the accident on that highway years ago had killed the human part of me. It’s not something I linger on, but it often feels like my life just happens around me. It’s only times like now where I confront my inactivity.
A character caught between pages, realizing something isn’t right.

But enough pretentious musing. I had an odd memory the other night. I found a picture of my old Mazda, a beautiful silver convertible I had loved to drive with the top down deep into the night. Something about it stirred a recollection in me, a memory bubbling to the surface of my mind.

The night of the accident, I’d found a bridge on Wesley Earl Road. I wasn’t sure of anything beyond that, but I felt like my adventure had ended that night on the bridge.
I’m not sure how many more answers I can find here. In the meantime, I managed to finish another page.
 
-       - -
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been gone, but the town had not waited for a triumphant return. None of the faces felt familiar, and despite recognizing street names, he was surprised repeatedly by how the businesses all seemed to bear unfamiliar names. It was clear he was past the point of asking anyone for help.

The midway sun washed the world in stark, pale white light and he couldn’t help but wonder if it only seemed so to him. Another question constantly burrowing in the corner of his mind was where he was intending to go. His legs seemed to carry him across the bleached pavement with a sense of purpose he didn’t understand in the slightest.

It wasn’t until he came to rest before a large, imposing structure that he recognized the destination. The sight of “Arthur Clarke Hospital” emblazoned across the side of the building made his stomach churn. The nausea fled as he realized there was nothing inside to heave, anyway.

The cry of a crow caught his attention, followed by the rustle of wings slicing through the air. He turned to find a thin figure draped in black now standing behind him. The figure was pale, with paper white features and long platinum hair whose strands seemed immune to the wind. The lanky man flashed a disarming smile and answered before being asked, “Yes, I can see you.”

Kyle’s voice caught in his throat, silence stretching between the pair until the man added, “I didn’t expect you to remember me. You never do.”

A car drifted between us, brakes sighing as it came to a stop. The occupants remained staring ahead, blissfully unaware of the exchange. With a touch of hesitation, he asked, “Are you… Death?”

A rough laugh escaped the man. “I’m Carl, actually. The big man rarely takes shifts anymore. No, I was once like you. Though, maybe not as big a pain in the ass.”
Kyle turned away to face the hospital, still at a loss for why he’d felt so driven to come here. He felt a growing sense of dread that culminated in the question, “Are you here to take me?”

Carl’s smile sharpened, his porcelain features set into a grim mask as he replied, “You have to be ready. We only force the violent ones. You’re not there, yet. For now, you’re still harmless.” After a pregnant pause, Carl seemed satisfied he’d made his point and finished, “Keep checking your journal. I’ll be around.”

 Kyle turned back at the sound of another wing beat to find the road behind him empty again. His fingers grasped the leather binding of the journal and he brought it into the light, flipping to a random page. To his surprise, a new message awaited him, scrawled with fresh ink.

She never even had a chance.

 May 20
I drove down Wesley Earl Road last night. It was completely different in the absence of any drugs or alcohol, yet the road played its same old tricks. I drove for what felt like hours, only to find my clock had inched ahead by forty-two minutes. My speedometer told a similar lie. In the end, I turned around and came home without incident. 

It felt like the longer I was on that road, the more pronounced every bump and turn grew, as though warning me away from something terrible. My nerves eventually won out, and I turned around long before confirming if there was any bridge at the end, or if that had all been a mistaken memory. In the meantime, I finished another page of The Abandoned House. It feels like the story is ending, and with it I’m not sure what I’ll find. Even though I’m writing it. 

Aren’t I? Who else could be writing it?
-	- - 
Kyle’s legs carried him down an unknown path, each automatic step detached from his wandering thoughts. His mind flickered back to the first moment he ever truly felt alive. When a smile alone nearly knocked him off his feet. Annabelle’s smile. It was such a radiant, wide grin that seemed so disconnected from the rest of the world and its troubles. He saw it again the day he worked up the nerve to ask out the prettiest cashier in all of Redbrook. 

Their fate was sealed. 

Dates, anniversaries, family dinners, fights, moonlit walks and a modest wedding all flickered through his mind in seconds like a dream dissolving into dawn. The sweetest memories now stung the most. At the end of the chain he recalled the day the pair were lost blanched white walls with Annabelle crying and a professional walking them through what came next. Telling them it happens more often than people think. The moment gave birth to an anger and sadness that stripped the color from his heart. 

Nights spent losing himself in drinking came to mind. The endless silence filling the void between the two in their bed every night. The moment he’d stumbled in later than he’d meant to and found her beside a puddle of vomit filled with pills. 

The sky had been crying that night with him. He stopped walking to find himself staring at a grave. Though Annabelle’s name was alone on the stone, he felt two lives lost in the soil. He glanced down at the journal again to find fresh words within.

You weren’t there. Even when you were. 

He felt himself moving, but simply let himself ride passenger again on the way home. Before the door to the abandoned house, he stopped and looked over to find Carl waiting with a smaller smile than before. He asked the apparition, “How many times have I made it this far?” 

The reaper now stood next to him, silver eyes staring into the remnants of a forlorn home. Another gust of wind sprinted past and rattled the boards lining the windows. Eyes set afar he replied, “Five times. It’s been almost a decade. You’re lucky I’m so patient.” 

This time, his legs seemed to be patiently awaiting orders. Kyle nodded, contemplating what awaited him within. He asked the angel, “Why would you do this for me?” 
Wide smile returning to his sharp features Carl answered, “There’s only two kinds of spirits. The ones who move on and the ones that get destroyed. You’ve come close a few times. Lashed out at kids fucking around in there, but I think you can do it. It wasn’t easy for me, either.” 

He nodded at the reaper and smiled back as best he could. He wanted to ask what he needed to do but already knew. Kyle took a step into the doorway and stopped at the sound of Carl warning, “No pressure but, soon I may not have a choice.” 

Kyle turned to his only friend in the afterlife and nodded. Carl added, “I’ll be right outside, no matter what happens.” 

May 25

It all came back to me in a moment. Almost like the memory had always been there and I just didn’t want to retrieve it. When you wake up from a dream, the things your mind made up while your eyes were closed begin to fade. It’s different with a coma. When you wake, it feels like your memories and dreams entwine, like a tree grows around a signpost planted through its roots. Everything becomes a question. 

That night I found the bridge, it wasn’t night at all.

Dawn had begun to creep over the mountain, sunlight spilling through clouds suffocating the sky in a pale, almost white haze. I had come across a bridge and without a second thought begun barreling across it. In the fog, a rarity in such an acrid climate, I was surprised to find the bridge beginning to turn to the left. Most were long, straight affairs. 

It was only when I began spinning my wheel I saw it. I can’t say for certain if I was on the wrong side of the road, or he was. A pair of headlights burst out from the silent wall of white between us, directly coming my way on the narrow bridge. I swore aloud and yanked my wheel in the opposite direction, glaring stare leaving the road to try and take in the car I was careening to miss. 

It was a silver Mazda with the top down. In the driver’s seat a similar glare came to meet my own. Except it wasn’t similar. It was mine. For one instant, I saw myself in the car I’d just swerved to miss on the bridge that concluded Wesley Earl Road. 

And then months of darkness followed, swallowing up the unwanted memory. There isn’t anything else left to say. The only thoughtsI have are in a word, crazy. 

May 30

This is the end.
 
I’ve decided it’s time I drive to the end of the road. Find the bridge and see what’s waiting for me there. Maybe I am. I think now about the bent bone in my leg. To fix it, they had to snap it in three places and then reset it back to a straight line. 

Barry came through with a copy of the movie. Old and weathered, it nonetheless is the version of The Abandoned House he made back in the 90s. It’s a lot like mine, but the ending is different. I think it’s the last thing I needed to make up my mind. 

I’m going to put my last page here. I hope whoever finds it can understand. It might just be me, tired after a long fruitless drive. Or it might be someone else. Either way, I hope it finds you well. 

I hope it all makes sense. 

-	- - 

Kyle stepped through the door; his jacket tossed behind him. His eyes quickly snapped to an orange prescription bottle on the counter, and he wasted no time swallowing two Percocet with the help of some whiskey. He settled into his chair and waited for the mix of fire and medicine to find balance within him. 

A phone rang somewhere in the distance, its shrill tone piercing the silence. He ignored it, already certain any concern shown on the other end was just to mask contempt. He lifted the bottle and took another steady pull, before finding two more pills to down with a shrug. 

The world around him began to tilt, edges blurring into a comforting oblivion as he grinned at the thought of feeling nothing. Rising on quaking legs he leaned against the dining table and swayed his way over to the journal where he scrawled one last entry. His gaze drifted over to the corner of the room, at an empty object that he could never part with and yet tore his heart out with every viewing. He didn’t look at the words left on the paper. 

As Kyle stumbled around the room and finished off the bottle he eventually discovered a bottle of cough syrup and consumed that as well. As a Herculean feat, he hoisted himself back into his chair and collapsed into it. Every breath seemed a bit slower than the last, and his thoughts became aborted syllables echoing throughout an empty mind. Only one last thought broke though- had he taken too much?

As he leaned back, his eyes fluttered shut for the last time. From the doorway, what remained of him watched the scene with baleful, distant eyes. He watched the memory play out. He watched the broken man die in that chair. He cautiously approached the table, eyes welling with tears as they read the last words left in the journal.
We were going to name her Laura. 

The floor gave out beneath him and Kyle fell to his knees, eyes now coming to rest on the shattered crib in the corner of the decaying room. He released a raw, anguished cry as the memories all came flooding back. On the floor he shook and wept, recalling the very moment he’d died. It hadn’t been alone in that chair. 
It was in that pale white room in the hospital. 

He struggled to his feet; the lights in the house flickering to reveal a familiar world he imagined and the decaying truth. Settling back into the all too familiar chair he looked beside him, at a bottle of whiskey half full. 

Carl stood in the doorway, watching intently. Kyle’s fingers wrapped around the bottle cap, twisting it off as he brought the glass to his lips. He couldn’t let go. Could never begin to forgive himself for something he didn’t do. One last thought slipped through his mind as the liquor kissed the edge of his tongue, bringing him pause.
Is this what Laura would have wanted?

The bottle fell to the floor of the abandoned house, echoing alone.

1horj2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createdjustforthi-23/comments/1horj2d/29122024/,29/12/2024,"I dreamed about Andy this morning. I don’t remember much so here’s some random points: 

- He was my boyfriend 
- He was part of some “crew” 
- He wore a leather jacket and a single dangly earrings 
- He left me at the supermarket and said he’d be 10-15 minutes and I was still sat in the produce aisle waiting 4-5 hours later and people would come past and ask if I’m okay and I’d say yes just looking for something in my bag etc because I didn’t want to make him look bad 
- He eventually came back and tried to explain, I can’t remember past that though

It wasn’t a bad dream/I wasn’t upset or anything. 

This morning I got to do the crossword with mum and dad and had a bowl of mixed berries like bluebs, strawbs and blackberries as well as coffee. It was nice. I love these mornings. 

We have the kids staying today/tonight. I’m kind of really nervous about how it affects my time with Andy but I think it’ll be okay. I hope it will be. It doesn’t help to stress. I’m happy they’re staying but also idk, I love having them here it’s just a lot of work but I think now they’re older it will be easier. 

I had mum and dad harping on about my swimming again today, it makes me feel nice but also a compliment aimed at young me? Does it even count? No. But the things like saying how when I’d swim I would cut through the water with practically no wake, saying I was so graceful and elegant and how they would often get comments from my swimming tutors and other parents about my swimming etc. Silly things but it’s still nice. I will always remember one of my tutors, she had big long dreads and was always sunburned, anyway how the kid in front of me was going too slow during swim squad practice so I overtook him but on the inside of the lane as he was taking up heaps of the lane and she said how it was risky but she loved it and she was really impressed - such a minor comment but it always stuck with me. Maybe I should swim again… I do love being in the water, but also my skin would go *berserk* with the chlorine and all the water so probably not. 

We just had the yummest lunch. There was ham and stuff, but the stuff I had was a springy green frittata with relish, a cucumber/avocado/mint/lettuce salad, fresh bread that it was still warm, a boiled egg and I think that’s it. It was such a nice summery lunch! I loved it. 

My eyes are still allergicky :( They kind of hurt. I have no antihistamines. I’ll have to get some tomorrow when I collect my prescription. 

I really do not think kids are for me. But then I think about having just the one, like a lil trio of Andy, me and baby and cute ?????? But idk. It would be fun leading them through life and experiencing things again from a kids perspective. And I think of so many nice family things we could do like picnics, movies nights, swimming, holidays, lil afternoon naps - the thought of Andy laying on the sofa having a nap with our very own little one laying on his chest also fast asleep? I honest to god thing I will explode. He’d be such a wonderful daddy, but should you have a kid because you think your man would be an excellent father? Not sure. 

I’ve spent the afternoon with the kids taking them to the pool with my mum and SIL and I got to paddle my feet, then we played three rounds of monopoly deal which is the besstttt game and then a round of trouble because *duh*. I lovedddd trouble as a kid, I remember being little enough that I couldn’t easily press the plastic bubble down and would have to jump my weight on to it. 

It’s so hottttttt.

He hates the smell of sunscreen :( here I was picturing us having a lil beach evening picnic and the coconutty sunscreeny vanillery perfume I’d wear but I suppose back to the drawing board with that. I wonder when I can wear them, as I like them lots? Not around him, evidently. I want him to always think I smell delicious and kissable and I’m certainly not wearing something I know he dislikes. I want him to pull me in when we’re out and about, like even at the supermarket and just give me a little kiss on the neck and a not-creepy sniff of me, is that a weird thing to want? I don’t think so. I hope he pulls me in for lil kisses and cuddles and is as touchy as I know I will be. I mean time and place of course but I just love little touches - like out for dinner with one of our parents and he has his arm on the back of my chair and his fingers tracing my back or my hand on his thigh, or at home on the sofa and maybe we want our own space but just still touching a lil bit like my toe touching his leg or better yet sitting with my legs draped over him or whatever else. Idk. Anyway. 

I don’t have anything meaningful to say today. 

Andy’s being so utterly wonderful and understanding about my timeline this evening with the kids. It has taken such a load of stress off my shoulders. I’m still stressy about things going to plan because no one respects my timelines but anyway. He’s just so good :) Baby. 

I read the kids four books - one each picked out, I picked one out and pups picked one out. It was really cute, I do adore them to bits. I don’t doubt that ever but they’re truly brilliant lil things. 

My eeeyyyyeeeessssssss :( 

Okay time to spend the rest of the night with my honey! Yay :)
