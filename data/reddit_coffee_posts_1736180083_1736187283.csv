1hv5inb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1hv5inb/disney_transport_is_a_nightmare/,Disney Transport is a Nightmare,"At terminal C in Houston. Supposed to sail out on the Magic this afternoon out of Galveston. Paid for Disney transportation. The website said it starts at 9:15am. My husband called last night and they told him to be back at the airport between 10-10:30am. It’s now noon and we are still waiting for the bus. 

The staff here said it’s multiple coach bus companies and they didn’t have much of an explanation for this delay. A fellow passenger who is also waiting was told that our bus left at 9:30a and that bus is on its way back for us. She’s now also been on hold for 45min trying to get in touch with another Disney cruise rep. 

There’s an empty coach here with a Disney driver and he has been making calls to try to let him just take us, but they’re telling him no. 

So much for getting there early. I’m extremely disappointed. For all of that ‘Disney Magic’ Disney talks about this is far from it. Disney should have their own fleet of buses for all of the money that they have. This is a complete mess. 

Also, there’s practically no amenities here at terminal C. You need to take a tram to A or the hotel, but the coffee shop at the hotel closes at 11. There’s also very minimal seating due to Houston’s own city policies.

My old setup was an ECM paired with a Eureka Specialita, which worked fine, but I’m ready for something better that can handle my needs and plans for the future.

Right now, I’m making 10-20 drinks every morning to sell to neighbors in my apartment building. Eventually, I want to start a coffee cart, so I’d like a grinder that can keep up with that kind of workflow.

Budget: $1K–$1.5K

I’ve been eyeing the Fiorenzato AllGround Sense because it’s GBW (grind by weight), which would make mornings a lot easier. Plus, it matches my Linea Mini R’s matte black finish, so it’s kind of perfect.

That said, I just found an amazing deal on a brand-new Fiorenzato F83 E Pro for $1.2K. It’s such a great price, but the lack of GBW is making me second-guess it.

What do you all think? Should I grab the F83 E Pro, stick with the AllGround Sense, or is there another grinder I should be considering? Would love to hear your thoughts",2,1736186966.0,LaMarzocco,1,1.0,False

Waiting at the walk-up window usually takes a second since it’s mostly a drive-thru shop, but they’re fast. I get a 10 minute break and can easily walk the block to the shop, order, get my stuff, and walk back in under 10 minutes.

No big deal, until today. I walk over, am waiting for one of the staff to come over to take my order when Boomer walks up behind me.

After what seems like a few seconds, he asks if I knocked while simultaneously stepping around me to bang on the window to get their attention.

The manager on duty comes over apologizing and says she’ll be right with me. “Take your time”

I see that she is training someone new as Boomer is asking a maintenance person taking down Christmas decorations if it’s faster to use the drive-thru.


After I ordered he got a cup of black coffee… it took 15 seconds for them to pour it… faster than it took him to take $5 out to pay for it…

1hv5e05,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1hv5e05/monogamy/,Monogamy ,"I’m struggling with whether to go to a speed dating event I signed up for and/or hang out with a couple romantic interests because I’ve been seeing someone for a few months.  I know the answer is to talk to them about, but to have that conversation I need to figure out what I really want.

I’m 18 months out, and met my LW 18 months after losing my first girlfriend, also around the holidays.  I loved her but it was complicated and she struggled with serious issues.  She was jealous and possessive and it was co-dependent, but she also could be flirty and when things were bad she’s try to get attention from other guys.  That happened during a downward spiral that led to to her death from an ambiguously accidental rx pain med OD, and she got in touch with guys from HS / ex’s.  One OD’d, one committed, one was an ongoing dramatic thing until her death and he just passed from an OD this weekend.   For context, I don’t come off particularly edgy, and don’t do anything more than pot.  

So with this girl, our first date, we talked about seeing other people, and I was.  I’d tried to be FWB with another widow briefly, and that was the first time I’d felt really comfortable with someone post-loss, but she didn’t want to get attached, so for maybe 6 weeks we’d stayed friends while seeing other people, but I fell so hard for her and in my head was biding time and hoping to end up with her.  I started hooking up with someone I online and the sex was wild, but she was falling hard fast and I didn’t feel the same.  I had this very wholesome thing with one of my kids’ friends moms who I’d know for years, but it was going very slow and I was cautious.  I was also hanging out with a longterm friend who’s one of the most amazing people I know who disclosed they were ENM/poly, hiding it from their family, and looking to settle down. 

With the person I’m seeing, she’s spent much more time single than I have, dated casually between relationships, then was ENM for a few years, then decided that wasn’t for her and took a step back and is dating more for something long term (but still low pressure and open minded, which I appreciate). 

We get along really well.  So, after a few dates she told me she deleted the apps and doesn’t want to see anyone else but would give me time.  We were hooking up regularly, and exclusively.  I kissed the single parent, and she told me she hasn’t dated anyone in years, and she’s so nice and put together, but I’m a mess, so I didn’t really pursue it, although we still talk.  My former FWB was seeing someone else, then not, and really not ready for a relationship, and I was totally honest with her about everything.  My poly friend, same thing about being honest and transparent, and I’d never been comfortable trying to kiss, but felt like I’d passed a couple opportunities, so we went out for coffee and I leaned in, then stopped when I saw her perplexed a little, and she said she didn’t want to cross that line just out of curiosity and then we proceeded to have a nice afternoon as friends. 

The girl I’m went out with a guy she’s been friends with for a long time and his wife didn’t come, which triggered some insecurities but was ok, then had existing plans two days in a row “as friends” with an ex who was visiting from out of town.  But, she told me they’s stayed friends for years and nothing happened, then called me right after the first thing and said basically he was trying to get back with her, she didn’t want to and was happy, cancelled the second thing, and we spent the day together instead. 

We ended up spending four days in a row together, and I introduced her to my 6yo.  Just a fun activity, no harm, but it went really well and we went out a few times together since and it was really nice.  

So now this is like a relationship, although I haven’t asked her to be my GF or revisited the exclusivity talk.  She can be flirty and sociable, similar to my LW.  She travels a lot for work, and the trips involve a lot of drinking and people hooking up (moreso among the younger kids, she’s in management, but still).  

I booked this speed dating thing, which I really wouldn’t do, except I’ve wanted to try axe throwing and she doesn’t want to.  I also still really do like the single parent, and I’ve suppressed or gotten past my feelings for the widow and she’s not emotionally available, but I was so into her.  In both cases, we talk as friends, but if I made plans to hang out and wanted it to be more it could.  

I don’t want to share this girl, and we click in a cool way and have more fun than I have with anyone else.  But, I don’t want to be trapped or commit to something that’s not right.  If I see other people, then it’s only fair if she does, and then who knows.  In part, we stopped using protection and it’s really intimate, with a bit of BDSM in there, and aside from not wanting to share in general I hate thought of her like that with someone else.  And, with the widow, when we started seeing other people it was last time we hung out.  I think it felt weird for both of us.

So, I’m kindof just venting, kindof trying to figure out what to do.  ",0,1736186722.0,widowers,0,0.5,False
1hv5dk7,https://i.redd.it/l58sdsbfyebe1.jpeg,Who does Pinterest think I am?,"I was very surprised to see what Pinterest’s suggestions for me! Most of my boards are geared towards a country-western style and a bit of surreal Americana, but I guess my older, witchier pins (which I still love!) are heavily influencing my Pinterest algorithm.  

My searches were for animal, season, planet, plant, place, color, hobby, food, coffee, and character. My collage skills aren’t great, so I used the Layout app and ask ChatGPT to describe the result:  

“This collage is a collection of visually striking and evocative images, each carrying a sense of mystique and atmosphere:

1. **Top Left**: The swirling, vibrant bands of Jupiter evoke the grandeur and vastness of the cosmos.   
2. **Second from Top Left**: A chestnut horse rears with powerful energy, caught mid-motion, exuding wildness and grace.   
3. **Second from Top Right**: Rippling water captures light in a prismatic shimmer, resembling liquid art in nature.   
4. **Top Right**: An eerie scene of an abandoned chapel surrounded by overgrowth and reflected in a murky pond, where the skeletal remains of an animal rest—ghostly and surreal.   
5. **Middle Left**: A vintage-styled woman stands confidently near industrial surroundings, her attire and pose hinting at intrigue and defiance.   
6. **Center**: A decadent cheesecake topped with blackberries sits on soft, rumpled white linen—inviting yet otherworldly in its aesthetic.  
7. **Middle Right**: A narrow, fern-lined path leads into a lush, shadowy forest, suggesting mystery and escape.  
8. **Bottom Left**: Angel’s trumpets hang heavily from their lush green stems, their pale blossoms ethereal yet subtly ominous.   
9. **Bottom Right**: A cozy, creative corner featuring an open notebook, paint supplies, vinyl records, and scattered trinkets, evoking nostalgia and artistic introspection.   


The combination of images creates a mood that is both dreamy and haunting, blending natural beauty, decay, and moments of human artistry.”   

I then asked ChatGPT for three keywords to describe my collage. It gave me:  


1. **Ethereal**   
2. **Decay**    
3. **Mystique**    

And of course, I then asked for a title. Which was my favorite part of this entire exercise.  

**""Echoes of the Sublime and the Forgotten""**

I like the idea of putting some natural epoxy colors to match the walnut wood I'm using, and throw in some other tones in there to break it up so that it can let some light through. Maybe more opaque epoxy on the edges of the river, and lighter and more transparent colors in the center of it.

There has been this woman (age unknown, a bit younger than myself, let's assume 40ish) who works there at the front desk. Every time I'd bring my dog in, she would be beaming, and happy to see me. She would visit with me before my dog would go in, while my dog was in the back, and afterwards.

She told me things like her name, where she grew up, that she lived with a roommate, and that she loved to travel. She told me that she loved to travel after I had returned from a roadtrip and explained I had been away and seen lots of things for 3 weeks. She had told me that ""we should sit down sometime and talk more about your roadtrips"".

In the summer, I hadn't seen her for a few months, and one day she was working again. She instantly beamed her smile, and said that she had really missed me and my dog, and explained that her schedule had changed, and didn't line up with our appointments anymore. When I was rebooking the next appointment, I said it needed to be X days from today, and I counted, and gave her the date, and she confusingly asked about the day prior. After I had left, I thought maybe she was trying to coordinate my next appointment with when she was scheduled again, but I had to be X days from the prior visit, not a day more or less. So I booked for the day I mentioned, and left.

Suddenly, she was gone from the vet clinic. The vet mentioned that they had had a reorganization of staff, and some changes were made.

Knowing her name from her prior conversation with me, I looked her up on a social media platform, and I wanted to message her. But I didn't. I was too scared to. 5 months go by, and it was New Year's day. I was thinking about her, and wondering if she had posted anything, and she suddenly posted something, for New Year's, which I replied to, wishing her a Happy New Year.

Once she saw it, a few hours later, she followed me back, and replied to my message ""That makes me so happy!!!!!!! Thank you so much! I hope you had a great first day of 2025! \[5 party emojis\]"".

I replied back ""I did, hope your first day of 2025 was also terrific. \[dogname\] and I have really missed seeing you at the vet clinic. I was surprised to hear you no longer worked there."". She saw the message a few minutes later, but didn't reply back to me until 3 days later. Which she said ""It seems like so long ago since I've seen you guys. I am so happy to hear from you.""

I replied a few minutes later, saying ""I think it was July the last time I saw you. How have you been? Are you doing well?"" She hasn't seen that message, yet, since 2 days ago.

I was thinking of waiting a few more days, and if she doesn't respond, just sending a message inviting her out for a coffee. If she does respond, and it's more of the above, I was also going to invite her out for a coffee. If she doesn't reply, I after I was just going to leave it.

There, I picked a few basics that I figured each store would have, and I always picked the simple version of each: coffee, frozen vegetables, milk, cheese, chicken, and crackers.



Below are the results, with cheapest prices **bolded**:

It goes like this:

* Wake up without an alarm, which can happen anytime between 4am and 7am.
* Make the bed and throw on loungewear, jammie pants, T-shirt, slippers.
* Make a cup of coffee.
* Work morning puzzles like sudokos, Wordles, crosswords (there's a lap I make) until I'm functioning.
* Make some breakfast once the stomach decides just coffee is not right. I've been an experimental foodie, so this is sometimes interesting.
* Finally get some real clothes on with real shoes. I'm almost always dressed by 8:30.
* Review my list of to-dos for the day and get started on it.

We went on 2 dates, had a lot of chatting while she was traveling, and just went on our 3rd date yesterday.

1st date: Went great. She extended it and we ended up spending 4.5 hours together.

2nd date: We went ice skating but it was kinda underwhelming. We cut it short and went to a coffee shop, had a great conversation and again the overall date lasted 4 hours.

The conversations while she was away became so engaging that we were texting heavily too many details and sharing pictures of our day etc. I started feeling we’re getting closer.

3rd date: I was excited but got anxious again as if I was meeting her for the first time since it’s been a while. We talked over dinner but after 2 hours she asked to leave because she still feels tired after she her trip. I was clearly vulnerable and she noticed so she said let’s maybe walk around. When I got home, I texted to ask if she’s home safely, she responded that she is and asked about me. I said yes.

Niranjan Mehta often wondered what it might be like to let his eyes rest on something other than the

Arabian Sea. From the balcony of his tenth‑floor flat in Malabar Hill, that sea glimmered every

morning, enticing and empty all at once—like a polished mirror that only reflected his own worries.

Sometimes, standing out there, warm mug in hand, he would notice a yacht slicing through the

water. Perhaps it was a millionaire’s toy; perhaps it belonged to a visiting European. Mostly, though,

the sea was lifeless gray, offering him no real comfort, only an infallible sense of routine.

He lived in a spacious three‑bedroom apartment with his wife Anuja, their sixteen‑year‑old son

Shaan, and his seventy‑year‑old mother. In addition, of course, there was Rima, their live‑in

housekeeper and cook from a village near the Nepal border, and Imran, their driver, who lived in a

servant’s quarter in the basement garage. The building was a tall, modern structure in one of

Mumbai’s most prestigious enclaves, but the daily existence that took place within it, Niranjan often

felt, was one of small inconveniences piled upon small annoyances.

He heard the door creak behind him. Anuja emerged onto the balcony, freshly showered.

“Your coffee’s getting cold,” she said with a hint of exasperation, “and we have to leave in an hour for

that brunch at the Taj.”

Niranjan exhaled. “Yes, yes, I’ll be ready. Just trying to gather my thoughts. Do you know if Rima

remembered to iron my shirt?”

“Of course she did.” Anuja frowned. “Though, you know, she’s been complaining about her cousin’s

illness again. She might ask for time off.”

“Hmm,” said Niranjan noncommittally.

He gazed at the horizon, mulling over the typical Sunday fiasco: a plush brunch with the same circle

of friends, full of polite chatter, mild gossip, and that whiff of envy that lingered whenever someone

mentioned new business deals or real‑estate acquisitions. He felt that creeping suspicion that they

were all, in some sense, bred for pleasure—educated in top schools, cushioned by their family

resources, rattling around in oversized flats, anointing themselves with the mild but incessant

irritations of daily life. They had no real tragedies—no hungry children, no catastrophic lack of

money, no great conflict. And yet, how they fussed over the most trivial matters.

2

It had started two weeks earlier, when his friend Rohit announced he was buying a second property

in the new upscale tower near Tardeo. The notion churned in Niranjan’s head for days afterward:

Why can’t I manage to buy another property? He envisioned the gleaming tower, the high ceilings,

the panoramic view that outdid his own. He would never admit it to anyone—not even to Anuja—but

he felt a throb of envy so acute it sometimes bordered on rage. An absurd daydream took hold of

him one evening, in which he imagined bludgeoning those blessed with such real‑estate luck. He felt

ashamed immediately afterward, but the venom had surprised him. There was some fundamental

contradiction in the way he prided himself on being an enlightened, liberal man while wanting to

throttle the owners of bigger flats and better addresses.

That conflict continued even as he rechecked his email. He was a “consultant” to a finance firm,

working from home these days—though “consultant” was an inflated term for what mostly amounted

to sending a few emails and reading market reports. Anuja worked part‑time with an NGO that

produced children’s storybooks, but it was, in truth, more a side interest. They could survive on

family money if they wanted. And yet that sense of anxiety, the fear that someone else was always

climbing above them, gnawed at Niranjan. He was stuck in the half shadows of “upper‑middle class,”

overshadowed by that new breed of truly wealthy neighbors who strolled around Malabar Hill in

brand‑name wardrobes, glitzy cars, and an unshakable sense of self‑assuredness. It rankled him in

ways he could hardly admit.

3

The day after the Taj brunch, Niranjan sat in the living room, swirling the dregs of his late‑afternoon

tea. Rima had been quiet all day. She was folding laundry and ironing clothes in the corner, humming

under her breath in a low, sad tune. Anuja was in the next room, halfheartedly practicing a piece on

the piano; she had convinced herself she could become “cultured” by taking up music in her forties.

Occasionally, a dissonant chord rang through the flat.

Rima set down the iron and cleared her throat. “Sa’ab… I— I need to ask for some days off. My

cousin who lives in Sikkim—he’s very ill.”

She spoke in awkward Hindi, occasionally slipping into Nepali. Niranjan had always been a bit

uneasy with people from the far north or east—call it prejudice or ignorance, but something about

their features reminded him of foreigners, possibly the dreaded “Scandinavians” that an old friend,

half‑jokingly, had ranted against for no rational reason. The sense of difference niggled at him. Rima

was gentle and quiet, and still, he found it difficult to trust her wholeheartedly.

“How many days?” he said.

“I do not know—maybe a week, maybe ten days.”

“That long?” The cost of a stand‑in domestic worker for so many days alarmed him—besides, it was

so inconvenient. He had grown used to Rima’s cooking, the careful way she cleaned, the small

touches. “Are you certain you can’t postpone…?”

She bowed her head. “He’s in the hospital, Sa’ab. I’m sorry.”

He forced a small nod. “Yes, yes. Let’s see how we manage. Just let us know as soon as your return

date is certain.”

That conversation vexed Niranjan more than he wanted to admit. It was an utterly normal request,

not at all shocking, yet it underscored how reliant they were on her. He knew people of his class

usually professed compassion and liberal values—We’re not like those exploitative feudal types,

they all told themselves. Yet here he was, resentful that a young Nepali woman might dare to take

days off to care for a sick cousin. Did that make him a hypocrite? Or was it normal to be frustrated at

the “mild nuisances” that chipped away at his comfort?

4

That evening, Niranjan and Anuja went to a neighbor’s dinner party in the building’s penthouse. The

hostess, Arti, was rumored to come from a princely background in Rajasthan, though that was half

gossip, half self‑mythologizing. A few of Niranjan’s acquaintances from the brunch scene were there

too, nibbling on canapés and discussing the new wave of development in Mumbai.

“Oh, that monstrous glass tower next to the Hanging Gardens is an eyesore!” said one guest,

swirling her wine. “All these outsiders pouring into Malabar Hill. They’ll ruin the character of the

neighborhood.”

Niranjan found himself nodding in agreement, even though he’d never quite minded new buildings.

But a flicker of envy shot through him: that tower was rumored to have apartments listing at

astronomical prices. Yet part of him wanted it blocked, purely because it threatened the exclusivity of

Malabar Hill.

Another guest, a banker with a reedy voice, said, “We must keep the neighborhood refined. These

new developments will allow all sorts of riffraff—no family background, no sense of culture. I’m telling

you, it’s time we adopt stricter rules at the society level.”

Niranjan forced a courteous smile. He was not sure whether he was more appalled by the man’s

blatant prejudice or by the twinge of agreement in his own heart: Yes, keep out the riffraff. And then

there was a contradictory thought that bubbled up: But if they can afford it, they’re hardly

riffraff—they’re richer than we are.

Meanwhile, Arti breezed by, asking if they’d like more wine. “You must see the new painting I

bought,” she crowed. “It’s a Husain, you know.”

Anuja perked up. “A Husain? Truly?”

Arti led them into her living room, where a large abstract piece hung in pride of place. She clicked

her tongue, explaining the significance of the piece, quoting an art critic’s appraisal. Niranjan

watched as Anuja nodded along, murmuring appreciative words. Another guest feigned recognition,

though Niranjan suspected none of them truly understood the painting’s subtleties.

“Such a sophisticated piece,” Anuja cooed.

“A conservative’s paradise, in a way,” Niranjan said under his breath to her.

She gave him a quizzical look, and he shrugged. “We posture about modern art, but we really just

want to show off,” he murmured.

She gave him a hush, hush elbow in the ribs. “Don’t be so sour.”

5

Later that night, after they had returned home, Niranjan paced around the living room, tugging at his

collar.

“Those people,” he muttered, referring to the dinner party crowd, “they’re so full of contradictions.

They praise liberal art while wanting to keep out new residents who don’t fit their idea of a ‘cultured’

neighbor. This is the same Arti who hired a wedding planner from Delhi because ‘locals can’t match

the aesthetic sense.’ I can’t stand such hypocrisy.”

Anuja yawned. “We’re all hypocrites, Niranjan, darling. We just wear different masks. Did you see

how you nodded along with the complaints about that new tower? You were complaining about

losing exclusivity.”

He stiffened. “That’s different.”

“Is it?” She cocked an eyebrow. “You sounded pretty NIMBY yourself—‘Not in my backyard.’ Or do

you only say that because you can’t afford a flat in that new building?”

He glared at her, stung by the truth. She gave him a weary smile and headed to their bedroom.

Niranjan remained in the living room, flipping through some old books. One title caught his eye:

Mystic Tales of the West. It was a leftover from his father’s library—an odd compendium of myths

and half‑baked theological musings. He opened it randomly, skimming passages about a “Pharaoh

of the Father,” cosmic hierarchies, illusions of property and ownership. The grandiose language of

sacrifices and paternal authority made him uneasy, but also weirdly fascinated. A line stuck with him:

“He who builds his own false kingdom will forfeit the true inheritance.”

He thought about how each of them, in that building or in that circle of acquaintances, was indeed

constructing some “false kingdom” of property, status, a carefully curated social identity. He snapped

the book shut. It was too late for such musings, and he had an early morning phone conference

anyway.

6

The next day, Rima left for Sikkim. She left quietly at dawn. Shaan was still sleeping, so Niranjan had

to make tea for himself. He fumbled in the kitchen, scalded his finger slightly, cursed under his

breath, and then realized the day’s tasks had ballooned: We have no one to cook dinner.

Anuja proposed ordering in. “We’ll figure it out,” she said breezily. But the smallest disruptions

unsettled Niranjan. He had always told himself he was an adaptable, modern man, but now he

discovered how dependent he was on Rima’s steady presence. He felt foolish for his frustration—did

that make him like a spoiled child?

Imran, the driver, was milling about near the dining table, presumably waiting for instructions. He

was a laconic man from a small village in Maharashtra, carefully professional.

“Sir, shall I bring the car around at 11 for your meeting?”

“Yes, yes. Also, do you mind if I ask you to pick up some groceries on your way back?”

Imran nodded; he took out a small notepad, scribbling a list.

Before leaving, Niranjan checked his phone. A group chat with old college friends was buzzing. One

friend, Vikram, had posted pictures of his new villa in Alibag—a weekend getaway. Sparkling pool,

open lawn, an airy deck. Others chimed in with congratulatory messages. Niranjan felt that pang of

bitterness again, like a worm in the pit of his stomach. Vikram was never particularly bright; how did

he manage this new villa?

He typed out: Congrats, looks lovely. Then he scrolled away, seething in silence.

7

Over the next few days, the household sank into a kind of comfortable disarray. Meals came from

swanky delivery services, laundry piled up until Anuja shoved it into the washing machine, clothes

remained half‑ironed. The mild vexations added up, stoking little arguments between husband and

wife. Shaan muttered under his breath about the state of the household, though he personally did

nothing to help. Niranjan found himself uncharacteristically short‑tempered with the boy, snapping at

him for trivial issues such as leaving the lights on or wearing shoes in the living room.

He recognized, in the rational corner of his mind, that their problems were negligible. They were still

cushioned by money, by the safety of a well‑guarded building, by endless amusements. And yet the

accumulation of these small domestic inconveniences created a sense of oppression—he recalled a

line he’d once read, that the “thousand mild nuisances of middle‑class life are, in their total sum, a

greater suffering than the few but acute miseries of the poor.” It sounded absurd, even offensive, yet

he caught himself half agreeing with it at times, especially when stuck in a petty meltdown over

missing socks or delayed deliveries.

On the fifth day of Rima’s absence, Niranjan hired a temporary cook. She arrived that evening, a

stout woman named Meenakshi, who introduced herself in a voice that dripped with forced

politeness. The second night, she messed up the dal—too much salt. On the third day, the chicken

curry had lumps of half‑cooked masala. Niranjan’s stomach churned as he glared at the plate,

certain that she was incompetent.

“Don’t be such a snob,” Anuja chided him. “You’ll eat fine dining at posh restaurants but can’t handle

a slight oversalting? She’s doing her best.”

He didn’t respond. Instead, he recalled that line about how “the bride becomes a harlot when the

vow is broken.” A random snippet from that weird old book. It was about how everything has a

rightful place, and the disruption of that order leads to chaos. Maybe the “harlot” was, in some

metaphorical sense, the household turned upside down without Rima—though Niranjan was vaguely

embarrassed by how archaic that metaphor sounded.

8

Meanwhile, the tension with the new building project near the edge of Malabar Hill was ramping up.

Residents of Niranjan’s society had formed a small action group to protest the planned expansions.

“We can’t have more towers blocking our sea view!” one neighbor cried. “And do we want more

traffic? More noise? The place will turn into a carnival.”

They circulated petitions, pointed out the historical heritage of Malabar Hill, argued that uncontrolled

development would ruin the “aesthetic.” Niranjan found himself in a heated meeting in the building’s

community hall. He recognized this was all classic NIMBYism, but he still joined in. The sea view

was part of why he lived here, wasn’t it? He wanted that intangible sense of privilege, that subtle

superiority in being able to gaze upon the horizon. If others built equally tall or taller towers, that

vantage might be lost.

After the meeting, he realized how petty it sounded: these were men and women who had more than

enough space to live comfortably, balking at the idea that future residents might want the same. But

pettiness seemed to be woven into the fabric of Malabar Hill’s social tapestry.

9

By the time Rima finally returned, pale and drawn from her cousin’s funeral, Niranjan felt a twisted

combination of relief and annoyance. She quietly resumed her cooking, cleaning, and tidying,

seamlessly restoring the household’s daily rhythm—like a high priest returning order to a chaotic

temple.

Yet, as soon as Rima was back, Niranjan’s mind began to drift elsewhere. It was as if, now that the

small domestic headaches were solved, a deeper existential restlessness had returned. Everything

felt too easy again, lacking drama or meaning. Niranjan began to wonder if he needed those small

annoyances just to keep him from confronting bigger emptiness inside him.

After dinner on her second day back, Rima lingered near the sink, as if wanting to say something.

Niranjan asked, “Is everything all right?”

She hesitated. “I—I only want to say… Thank you for giving me leave, Sa’ab. My cousin…he did not

survive. But I appreciate the time.”

Niranjan swallowed. “I’m sorry for your loss.”

She nodded, eyes downcast, and disappeared into the kitchen. For a moment, Niranjan felt small,

almost ridiculous. Here he was, day after day, dwelling on petty class anxieties, while Rima had

faced real grief. He wondered if he had become so numb that someone else’s tragedy was just a

passing footnote in his busy interior monologue about property values and social hierarchies.

10

One afternoon, a few days later, Niranjan decided to stroll through the quiet lanes behind his

building. Malabar Hill, for all its aura of sophistication, still had pockets of old homes, lush trees,

hidden shrines. He turned a corner and found himself near a grand bungalow overshadowed by tall

hedges. He’d always been aware of it—a relic of British‑era Bombay. Rumor said the old widow who

lived there had refused to sell to any developer. Good for her, he thought, with a flicker of admiration.

He noticed a caretaker outside, sweeping the walkway. The caretaker paused, sizing him up.

Niranjan asked if the old lady was still in residence. The caretaker gave a curt nod. Niranjan

hovered, uncertain why he’d even come. Then, on an impulse, he stepped forward and peered

through the slightly open gate. In an instant, the caretaker’s posture stiffened. The unspoken

message: This property is not yours.

Niranjan sighed, turning away. A curious bitterness spread inside him, imagining how vast that

bungalow might be on the inside. How grand the rooms, how storied its walls. And again, that

absurd, fleeting fantasy: he wanted to “bludgeon” the idea of someone owning a property so

enviable. That savage envy surged up, then subsided, leaving him with a wave of guilt. He was no

barbarian. He even prided himself on reading serious literature, on supporting charitable causes. Yet

within him lurked something primitive. “We’re all idolaters,” he heard the old text in his mind. We

worship illusions, and they slowly devour us.

11

One evening, Niranjan was flipping channels, bored. A real estate commercial flashed on the screen,

extolling the virtues of a new development: Gated community. Impeccable sea view. The future of

luxury. He changed the channel in annoyance. In the next moment, a documentary about child labor

in India began, featuring shocking images of kids in dusty factories. Niranjan’s immediate reaction

was to turn it off—he didn’t want to be reminded of such realities. Then he froze, realizing how that

simple action—turning away from real suffering—epitomized everything that bothered him about the

bubble he inhabited. We’re so coddled, we become useless. We want to bury ourselves in illusions

of art, property, and private amusements.

He let the documentary run for a while, forcing himself to watch. After a few minutes, he stepped

onto the balcony, letting the crisp air cling to him. Lights shimmered across Marine Drive below. He

wondered what it would take to feel genuinely engaged with the world again—whether it would

require giving up certain comforts, or acknowledging that these “thousand mild nuisances” were a

petty farce next to the heartbreak so many faced.

12

Shaan, in the meantime, was finishing tenth grade. One night, he demanded that Niranjan buy him a

pair of expensive imported sneakers. “All my friends have them,” Shaan whined. “I’ll look like a loser

if I don’t get them.”

Niranjan’s face heated with anger. “They’re overpriced nonsense.”

“But you can afford them,” said Shaan, lips twisted in teenage defiance. “You waste more on a single

dinner out.”

Anuja tried to mediate. “Maybe he does have a point, Niranjan. It’s not that big a deal.”

“Not that big a deal?” Niranjan exploded. “It’s insane. We keep throwing money at him for empty

status symbols.”

That evening, father and son barely spoke. Niranjan retreated to the study, sifting through old notes

of his father’s. He came across a line scribbled on an envelope: “One cannot buy immortality, only

illusions of it through property.”

13

A week later, a house‑warming invitation arrived from Vikram, the old college friend with the Alibag

villa. He had arranged a get‑together. Niranjan dreaded it, yet found he couldn’t refuse. So, on a

bright Sunday morning, Niranjan and Anuja boarded the ferry to Alibag. The sky was a brilliant blue,

the sea a restless green. Niranjan felt a mixture of reluctant curiosity and the usual swirl of envy.

Vikram’s new villa sprawled across a lush, manicured lawn. Tall coconut trees swayed in the breeze,

a shimmering swimming pool reflected the sun. As Niranjan and Anuja stepped inside, they were

greeted by cool marble floors, contemporary art, and large windows framing the ocean beyond.

“Niranjan, my friend!” Vikram beamed, patting him on the shoulder. “Come, see what I’ve done with

the place.”

He guided them through a series of airy rooms, each furnished with taste that was more expensive

than actually refined. A few other guests from their shared social circle were already there, sipping

cocktails, comparing notes on real estate and flamboyant travels to the Greek isles or Swiss chalets.

Niranjan forced a smile, engaging in small talk. He told himself to be gracious. But inside, the old

bitterness coiled. He found himself thinking in a style reminiscent of sardonic commentaries: Here

stands a coterie of newly minted patricians, prattling about how they despise the hoi polloi while they

themselves are overshadowed by someone else’s greater fortune.

Eventually, he slipped outside to the terrace, desperate for some air. Anuja followed, exclaiming,

“Isn’t it lovely?”

He nodded, not trusting his voice.

She looked at him carefully. “You hate it here, don’t you?”

He sighed. “I don’t hate it. I’m just… trapped in this weird conflict. A part of me wants exactly this—a

breezy villa, an escape from the city, a statement of success. Another part of me despises how it’s all

so performative.”

Anuja took his hand. “You remember you once said you wanted to do something meaningful with

your life? Something beyond counting property as success.”

He laughed bitterly. “I remember. But I got complacent. We all did.”

14

Back in Malabar Hill, life carried on. Rima quietly returned to her daily chores, Imran kept the car

polished, and Niranjan kept receiving invites from Rohit, Arti, and others for lunches, dinners, golf

outings. The humdrum machinery of the “upper‑middle-class” existence rolled forward. But the

tension inside Niranjan grew. He recognized he was engaged in a constant performance of cultured

liberalism—applauding progressive values in conversation, outwardly condemning prejudice—while

harboring resentments, envy, and a fierce desire to preserve his privileged vantage.

One late evening, he stepped into the living room and found Rima there, dusting the bookshelf. She

was staring at a photograph of Niranjan’s father.

“Your father?” she asked softly.

“Yes,” Niranjan said, smiling faintly. “He was a professor. A man of many books.”

She smiled politely and continued dusting. Then, with some hesitation, she added, “He looks…

strong.”

Niranjan paused. “He was. At least in his own way.”

15

The next week, a swirl of gossip about a potential redevelopment scheme near their building

reignited the building’s committee. Rumor was that a tall tower might replace an old structure,

overshadowing the entire area. Neighbors debated how to respond. The same old arguments

reemerged: traffic, aesthetics, property value. Niranjan found himself less inclined to join the fray this

time. Instead, he told Anuja, “Maybe we should just let the city evolve. We can’t cling to illusions.

People need places to live.”

She looked at him in mild surprise. “You’re changing your tune?”

He shrugged. “I’m trying to. I realize we hold onto this sense of Malabar Hill as a fortress. We want it

to remain a ‘conservative’s paradise’—untouched, unchanging. But that’s not how life works. And

maybe it’s not the worst thing if new families find a home here.”

16

A new tension brewed at home: Shaan’s final exam results were due soon, and there were rumors

about which college he might get into. Niranjan was uncomfortably conscious of how social standing

intersects with education—whether he could brag about his son’s admission into a prestigious

institution. Would Shaan secure a seat in one of the top colleges, or would he land somewhere less

shiny? The notion of “intellectual capital” as a form of status lay heavily on Niranjan’s mind. Even if

we’re overshadowed financially by others, at least we can be proud of academic or cultural

sophistication, he told himself.

He recognized this logic mirrored that same desire for “immaterial ways” to feel superior. If he

couldn’t outdo Vikram’s villa, then perhaps Shaan’s academic success would be a new source of

pride. In that fleeting moment, he felt ashamed at how he was turning his child’s future into an

emblem of paternal vanity.

17

In the midst of it all, a sense of quiet clarity came to him one evening as he stepped onto the

balcony. The sea spread out once more in its calm vastness, the setting sun casting pink and gold

ribbons across the sky. The hush of the moment stilled him. Anuja was inside, reading a magazine

about interior décor. Shaan was at his desk, presumably studying. Rima was chopping vegetables in

the kitchen, humming a soft tune. Imran was likely out picking up the dry cleaning. The building itself

bustled with unseen neighbors.

Niranjan inhaled the salty air. For a second, he was struck by how small his worries were in

comparison to the immense city beyond—this unstoppable churn of life, with all its heartbreaks, joys,

illusions, and truths. We’re all in borrowed spaces, he thought. Malabar Hill, for all its prestige, was

just another speck in the mosaic of Mumbai. He found an odd solace in the realization that maybe it

wasn’t necessary to “win” at every status game. The real challenge was learning to carry one’s

privileges without letting them corrode the soul.

He recalled a line from that old text: “Once the victim is immolated, he is one with the god.” It

sounded obscure, but perhaps it meant that letting go of one’s illusions—offering them up—is the

only way to find real communion with a higher truth. He breathed out, letting the tension drop from

his shoulders.

He couldn’t say that, overnight, he became a changed man. The knots of class envy, prejudice, and

ego run too deep. But as he stood there, high above the city, with the last slivers of dusk curling

across the sky, Niranjan allowed himself to taste a moment of release. He recognized he had a

choice: cling to illusions of property and petty resentments, or acknowledge them, let them burn

away, and carry on, perhaps a little lighter.

Rima called out softly from the kitchen, “Sa’ab, dinner is ready.”

He stepped inside. “Coming,” he said. “Thank you.”

Wordlessly, he crossed the threshold from the open balcony to the warm interior of his home,

aware—perhaps for the first time—that he was both beneficiary and prisoner of his privileges. The

knowledge wouldn’t vanish, but neither would the city’s unstoppable tide of change. In that

knowledge lay both the sting and the possibility of transformation. And as he sat at the table, the

familiar comfort of home enveloping him, Niranjan realized that, if nothing else, he was finally

learning to see this life—his life—for what it was: a precarious gift, a half‑built mansion in a city that

never sleeps.",0,1736186020.0,redscarepod,0,0.5,False

1hv506s,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1hv506s/oatly_phoenix_or_trash/,OATLY : Phoenix or Trash,"My prior post on my rationale on OATLY ($OTLY) investment triggered some nice conversations – so thanks for contributing ; but also triggered me to put some numbers behind in addition to 8 bullets why I think it is a turnaround story.

I will have two different calculations in this, one for a potential buyout scenario and second one for remaining independent.

First of all, it is obvious (also shareprice is reflecting this), it is a distressed investment including risks (debt , profitability and current cash flow as main concerns). In order to consider investing in such cases, I try to look at asymmetrical risk and reward… In this case, my personal opinion is reward is outpacing the risk ( which will be multiples of current share price – which can be counted as the risk)…

**Starting with the buyout scenario…** My personal consideration is Oatly will complement many multinational CPG’s portfolio like Coca Cola, Pepsi etc ; but for me the best leverage for both companies can be achieved by Nestle. They have a new CEO (Laurent Frexie) having 30 years of Nestle career, knowing Nescafe (coffee mate) business inside out, also targeting bringing growth back to Nestle- and Oatly is the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle.

\-          Both European companies, similar/same regulatory framework

\-          Nestle tried peamilk with plant based, failed and delisted. They still look for alternatives.

\-          Coffee mate business is bleeding, based on the latest financial reports for 2024, Coffee-Mate sales have faced some challenges, particularly in North America, where there has been a noted decline. Partially this is because of overall market situation , but more importantly plant based.

\-          Many synergies possible : workforce, office consolidation, supply chain optimization and increase in distribution.

So numbers : Oatly as business can be absorbed quite quickly and easily with a big MNC having global footprint. Any buyout will cut this corporate costs significantly based on synergies to be generated and oatly articles will be just additional SKU’s in the assortment. In my opinion, this is also the reason why Oatly keeps reporting corporate (cost center) different than the three regions (P&L centers).

This corporate costs account for \~25M per quarter, almost 100M per year. This number can be up to a large extent. In addition, similar synergies will be achieved in the regions (sales force, production footprint, brand initiatives etc etc)… It would not be off to think 30-40% of SG&A can be saved by all the synergies can be achieved, which will be an EBITDA contributor of 100M to 130M.

Given the natural progress achieved by the management brought quarterly losses from 50M to 5M in 6 quarters (potentially zero or green in Q4), overall EBITDA will be \~120M.

Given the growth potential that Nestle will bring in, a 20x multiplier will not be illogical. This will end up a 2.4B valuation which will bring share price to 4USD.

**The second one is having the company continuing operation independently and considering what they do**, and I see here 6 catalysts for revenue growth

1)      Starbucks removed in US/CANADA/Middle east surcharge of non-dairy.  This is result of pull from market, but also will fuel additional consumption with one of the biggest key accounts of Oatly.

2)      As mentioned in my previous post, they announced extended partnership with CostCo and Walmart, hired business manager director level at Bentonville for Walmart and VP level for club and CostCo. These are world’s biggest and biggest third retailers.

3)       Bird flu in dairy in US can influence consumer behaviour as well as supply chain of dairy products. In November , USDA announced milk output was 9.8% less than November 2023.

4)      Partnerships in China on going. In an interview with regional president David Zhang, he mentioned they reached 100.000 point of sales in Greater China. Luckin extended it is limited time offering (inc Q2 2025) , with a potential for a permanent partnership. They also recently announced extended partnership with Tim Hortons China.

Zhang also mentioned price fluctuations and market consolidation is over in China, with few players remaining in the field. (Keep in mind that population in southeast asia is highest lactose intolerance in the world. Also coffee consumption is growing double digit, but still much lower compared to high consumption countries).

5)      White space expansions are on going, recent big ones were Poland and Mexico, but also potentially  there are more lined up.

6)         Dairy industry is under pressure because of methane emissions and water consumption. Denmark announced to put cow tax starting from 2030, will most likely be followed by other countries. In addition, government subsidies will be challenged for an ""unsustainable"" industry. This will pressurize prices and close the price gap with plant-based.

Combining above revenue drivers with company effort to become profitable, with support from declining price of raw/pacl=k and logistics, it would not be surprising to see more than 10-15% revenue growth in 2025 onwards , with positive EBITDA. For companies in fast-growing, health-oriented segments may have P/S ratios ranging from 2 to 5, therefore 900M sales will lead to a valuation for 1.8B to 4.5B , giving the stock price (net of debt) 2.5USD to 6.8USD.

So, in my opinion, even with the current financial difficulties (debt & profitability) – Oatly fulfills the asymmetrical risk and reward opportunity…",3,1736185812.0,pennystocks,2,0.8,False

I (35f) am not feeling very birthday like today. Last year I became a stay at home mom. Daycare is so expensive so my husband (39m) and I agreed to this arrangement until we get approved for state daycare assistance. Anyways, I'm not bringing in an income now obviously. Christmas hubs and I talked about presents. Since I'm not working we decided we would choose a joint gift for ourselves as a couple and then focus on the kids 5yr m and 7m f. Finances are tighter and my husband didn't think it would be fair for me to get him a gift that he was paying for himself which made sense to me. Well, I guess my husband decided against the joint gift which was totally okay with me since I'm not contributing financially. 

Well today is my birthday. On Friday we took the kids to the play place in the mall. My husband bought himself some new shoes, got the kids some new clothes and gave me permission to check out some jeans since most of mine don't fit since having the baby. He gave me a few minutes to look and I did grab a pair for $17. I covered a shift at my old job on Saturday. Sunday we took the kids to the snow and planned on roasting hot dogs but my husband forgot the ketchup and buns. I have severe PTSD from going off a cliff in a truck in the snow when I was 17 so driving into the Mountains in the snow is quite traumatic for me. I ended up having to get out of the truck to walk up the hill with the kids because the truck started sliding too close to the edge for my comfort and of course I had a panic attack. Husband knows this as we've been together 16 years. 

Well it's Monday and my birthday. There has been no acknowledgement, no card, not even a note by the coffee pot this morning. Got my oldest off to school and babes and I are stuck at home with no money or gas. I know I'm not contributing financially anymore but does that lower my value? I just want to be celebrated a little. Last week I told my husband all I wanted was my favorite meal from my favorite restaurant... yesterday he informed me we were having the hot dogs we didn't have up on the mountain. Maybe we can't afford it, id understand if he just communicated that but I currently feel like a burden on his plate financially and idk, maybe Im being a selfish baby who just needs to get out over it.

1hv4ron,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/1hv4ron/rf_kuangs_books_promote_racist_stereotypes/,"R.F. Kuang's books promote racist stereotypes against Asians, especially Asian men","R.F. Kuang is a bestselling writer who is often upheld as “Asian-American representation” in the literary scene. Her novels include the *Poppy War* trilogy, *Babel*, and *Yellowface*. Recently, Lionsgate has announced that it will be [turning *Yellowface* into a television series, with Constance Wu set to be one of the producers](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/yellowface-rf-kuang-tv-serues-karyn-kusama-constance-wu-lionsgate-1236167053/).

Although Kuang is often marketed as a leading Asian-American voice, her books have actually *promoted* anti-Asian racism on many occasions. For example. in Book 2 of the Poppy War (*The Dragon Republic*), Kuang randomly inserts a scene where the characters laugh about white men having larger penises than Asians:

>“**Have you seen their penises**?” Kitay asked.

>Rin nearly spat out her fish. “What?” He gestured with his hands. “**Hesperian men are supposed to be much, ah, bigger than Nikara men**. Salkhi said so.”

>“How would Salkhi know?”

>“How do you think?” Kitay waggled his eyebrows. “Admit it, you’ve thought about it.”

For context, in *TPW*'s fantasy universe, ""Hesperians"" are an analogue for Europeans and ""Nikara"" are the stand-in for Chinese people. *TPW* takes place inside a fantasy version of China, and Kuang constantly makes efforts to describe China as filthy, uncivilized, and barbaric. In the first book, there's this conversation:

>Tutor Feyrik rubbed his beard. “While you’re at it, stay away from the street vendors’ soy sauce, too. Some places use human hair to simulate the acids in soy sauce at a lower cost. I hear hair has also found its way into bread and noodle dough. Hmm . . . for that matter, you’re best off staying away from street food entirely. They sell you breakfast pancakes for two coppers apiece, but they fry them in **gutter oil**.”

>“**Gutter oil?**”

>“Oil that’s been scooped off the street. The big restaurants toss their cooking oil into the gutter. The street food vendors siphon it up and reuse it.”

For those who don't know, the trope about ""Chinese gutter oil"" is a favorite canard used to denigrate and slander Asians. Radio Free Asia (a media outlet ran by the US government) made a [YouTube ""documentary"" about it which got over 7 million views](https://imgur.com/a/HCm8tMQ). After that, white redditors constantly started spamming about ""Chinese gutter oil"", with their [posts regularly hitting the front page and getting 20,000+ upvotes](https://i.imgur.com/qaWcqYF.png). Very strange that Kuang chose to validate this claim which was propagated by the American government and continues to be spread by white racists.

Kuang's standalone novel *Babel* also has weird racial undertones. In Babel, 2 of the main characters are Asian men - Robin Swift (half-white, half-Chinese) and Ramy Mirza (Indian Muslim). Guess what? The two Asian male characters end up in a homosexual romance with each other and both of them are killed off. There's a third AM, a side character named Griffin, who is also half-white and half Chinese, and who is also killed off before the novel ends. Literally all 3 of the AM characters die, lol. *Babel* also includes a scene which randomly brings up Chinese foot-binding to accuse Asian men of being misogynistic:

>Like many young Chinese women, Afong Moy’s feet had been broken and bound when she was young to restrict their growth and to leave them curved in an unnatural arch that gave her a tottering, unstable gait.

Kuang's latest novel (*Yellowface*) is especially awful, with one of the characters (Athena Liu) literally being Kuang's self-insert. Athena is described as a successful Chinese-American author who went to both Yale and Georgetown... which completely matches up with Kuang's IRL biography. *Yellowface* contains a scene where Kuang portrays herself (through her self-insert Athena) as a victim of ""misogynistic Asian men"" and claims to be a victim of ""MRAsians"" who object to her beautiful and progressive choice to exclusively chase after white men. The scene is as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/qwdhk9y7tebe1.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7209ea32f0ee232c9262211d6fcc21538bfbda

Remember that this shit is literally being adapted into a television series.

Finally, Kuang has another book coming out this August, *Katabasis*, which is a romance between two characters named ""Alice Law"" and ""Peter Murdoch"". This shouldn't be surprising, though - she's already showed her colors before. In 2018, she wrote this public [blog post (which she deleted and desperately tried to scrub, but is archived forever here)](https://archive.is/5boCY) which will tell you everything you need to know about her ideology.

**Cold Open/No Credits**: 

**INT. PADDYS- DAY.**  *Dennis is behind the bar, idly scrolling on his phone. Dee sits nearby, sipping a drink. The bar is unusually quiet.*

*Dennis’ phone buzzes. He glances at the screen, and answers.*

Dennis:
(nonchalant)
Yeah? This is Dennis.

*His expression shifts as he listens, his face tightening with confusion and concern. Dee notices and sits up straighter.*

Dennis:
(more serious)
..Wait, what? Are you sure?

*He listens for a moment, the color draining from his face.*

Dennis:
(quietly)
Okay… Yeah. We’ll be there.

*Dennis hangs up, staring at his phone, shaken. Dee, sensing something is wrong, leans in.*

Dee:
(concerned)
Dennis? What’s going on?

Dennis: 
It’s Fra- It’s Dad..
Frank’s gone.

*Dee’s eyes widen, and she sits back, processing the news. The weight of it hangs heavily between them.*

Dee:
(quietly)
Gone? Like… dead?

*Dennis nods slowly, his usual smugness replaced with a rare moment of vulnerability.*

Dennis:
Yeah. The bastard’s dead.

**Scene Transition**: Dennis and Dee arrive at the morgue. Charlie is already there, sitting quietly, looking more subdued than usual. The three of them stand in front of a morgue attendant.


**INT. MORGUE - LATER**

Morgue Attendant:
(matter-of-fact)
You’re here to ID a body?

*The gang exchanges uneasy glances. Dennis steps forward, trying to maintain his composure.*

Dennis:
(reluctant)
Yeah, we’re here for… Frank Reynolds.

*The attendant pulls back the sheet slightly, revealing just the edge of Frank’s body, but the camera stays focused on the Gang's faces. We see close-ups of their reactions—Dennis trying to stay composed, Dee looking away, and Charlie swallowing hard, his eyes welling up.*

Morgue Attendant:
(gently)
Is this him?

*Charlie, his voice breaking slightly, speaks softly.*

Charlie:
(whispers solemnly)
Yeah… that’s him.

The attendant covers Frank’s body again. The Gang stands there, the reality hitting them fully.

**ACT 2:** Back at Paddy’s. The Gang, now dressed in black funeral attire, sits at the bar, drinking and doom-scrolling. The atmosphere is heavy. Mac walks in, his usual upbeat self, oblivious.


Mac:
(cheerful)
What’s going on guys? What’d you guys suddenly decide to be gothic and edgy!? Emo Hot Topic was *so* 2003.

*Dee and Dennis glance at him briefly, then go back to their phones without a word. Mac, confused, looks around.*

Mac:
Guys..? Seriously! What’s with the…? Oh.

*Mac stops mid-sentence, realizing the gravity of the situation.*

Cue Title Card: **The Gang Plans a Funeral.**


**INT. CHARLIES APARTMENT - NOON**

*Charlie is alone, sorting through some of Frank’s belongings. The atmosphere is somber. The door opens, and the Waitress enters cautiously.*

Waitress:
(gently)
Hey, Charlie. I just heard about Frank. I’m… I’m really sorry.

*Charlie doesn’t look up, focused on the task at hand. There’s a tense silence.*

Charlie:
(quietly)
Thanks. I’m just… trying to get through his stuff.

*The Waitress approaches, attempting to offer comfort.*

Waitress:
Do you need any help? I can—

Charlie:
(snapping, emotional)
No! I don’t need help! I just… I just need to do this by myself.

*The Waitress steps back, surprised by his outburst.*

Waitress:
(defensive)
Charlie, I’m just trying to be here for you.

Charlie:
(frustrated)
I know! But I can’t… I can’t deal with you right now. I just need space.

*The tension hangs in the air. The Waitress looks hurt but tries to mask it.*

Waitress:
(softly)
Fine. If that’s what you want.

*She turns to leave, pausing at the door.*

Waitress:
..But you don’t have to push people away, Charlie. It’s okay to let someone in.

*Charlie says nothing, focused on Frank’s belongings. The Waitress exits, leaving him alone, visibly conflicted.*

**Scene Transition:**  *Paddy’s Pub. Dennis, Dee, and Mac are seated at the bar, still processing the news. Artemis enters, looking her usual flamboyant self, oblivious to the somber mood.*

Artemis:
(dramatic)
Okay, what’s the tea? I heard something juicy went down.

The Gang exchanges a glance. Dennis sighs, standing up to break the news.

Dennis:
(flatly)
..Frank’s dead, Artemis.

*Artemis freezes, her theatrical demeanor dropping instantly.*

Artemis:
(genuinely shocked)
What? No, no, no. Frank? Dead?

*Dee nods, her expression weary.*

Dee:
Yeah. It’s real. We just came from the morgue.

*Artemis processes this, her face contorting with genuine sadness. She sits down heavily on a barstool.*

Artemis:
(softly)
Wow. I didn’t… I didn’t see that coming.

*The room falls into a heavy silence, the weight of Frank’s death perceptible. Artemis breaks the quiet, her voice trembling slightly.*

Artemis:
What are we gonna do?

Mac:
(earnest, trying to lighten the mood)
We’re planning the funeral. It’s what Frank would’ve wanted… sort of.

*Dennis rolls his eyes, but there’s a shared understanding. Artemis nods, pulling herself together.*

Artemis:
(determined)
Alright. If we’re doing this, we’re doing it right. Frank deserves it.

*Dee leans in, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.*

Dee:
Let’s give him a send-off only we could pull off, but first we need the money to do it.. Frank was always our piggy-bank.

*The Gang exchanges a look, the faintest hint of their usual chaotic energy returning.*

**Scene Transition:** Back at Charlie’s Apartment. Charlie sits alone, staring at the scattered belongings of Frank, lost in thought.

**ACT 3**

**INT. OFFICE - EVENING.**

A small, dingy office. Dennis, Mac, Dee, and Charlie sit across from a disheveled, slightly exasperated man — their longtime lawyer, referred to as “The Jew Lawyer” by the Gang. Papers are strewn across the desk, and the lawyer looks at them over his glasses.

Jew Lawyer:
(deadpan)
So, let’s get straight to it. You’re here to discuss Frank’s estate.

*Dennis, trying to maintain some semblance of decorum, nods.*

Dennis:
(calmly)
Yes, we just want to know what kind of financial situation Frank left us in.

*The lawyer sighs, rubbing his temples.*

Jew Lawyer:
Well, here’s the thing… there’s no money.

*The Gang collectively leans forward, confused.*

Dee:
(skeptical)
W-What do you mean, ‘no money’? Frank had millions!

Jew Lawyer:
(matter-of-fact)
*Had* is the operative word. Over the years, you four drained his assets. The businesses, the cash… it’s all gone.

*Mac, looking horrified, shakes his head.*

Mac:
(in disbelief)
No, that can’t be right. Frank always had money. He had stacks of cash! Gold! Guns!

Jew Lawyer:
(shrugging)
All spent or liquidated. There’s literally nothing left. No funeral home, no coffin, no embalming. Nada.

*Charlie, distressed, stammers.*

Charlie:
(panicked)
So what do we do? We can’t just throw him in the trash!!

*Dee, ever pragmatic, crosses her arms.*

Dee:
(dryly)
Well, actually, that’s exactly what Frank would’ve wanted.

Dennis:
(sarcastic)
Oh yeah, great idea, Dee. ‘Hey, we’re the Reynolds siblings, we just tossed our dad in a dumpster!’ Very classy!

*Mac, leaning into the absurdity, raises a hand.*

Mac:
(thoughtfully)
Technically, Frank did say, ‘Throw me out with the trash.’ He was pretty clear about that.

Jew Lawyer:
(chiming in, amused)
Well, he wasn’t exactly a stickler for tradition.

*The Gang sits in stunned silence, absorbing the gravity and absurdity of the situation. After a beat, Dee smirks slightly.*

Dee:
(half-joking)
Could save us a lot of money.

*Dennis glares at her, but even he can’t fully suppress a smile. Charlie, however, is still visibly shaken.*

Charlie:
(earnestly)
We can’t do that. We can’t just… just dump him.

*The room falls into an awkward silence. The lawyer, sensing the tension, clears his throat.*

Jew Lawyer:
(gently)
Look, I know this isn’t what you expected, but Frank loved you guys. In his own weird, twisted way, he trusted you to handle things… your way.

*Dennis, trying to lighten the mood, leans back in his chair.*

Dennis:
(dryly)
Yeah, because when I think ‘responsible,’ I definitely think of us.

*Mac, ever the optimist, claps his hands together.*

Mac:
(enthusiastically)
Okay, so we do this the way Frank would’ve wanted: cheap and weird.

*Dee raises a brow, considering.*

Dee:
(grinning)
Cheap and weird. That does sound like us.

*Charlie, still hesitant, looks at the others. Slowly, he nods, a small, sad smile creeping onto his face.*

Charlie:
(softly)
Yeah… for Frank.

*The Gang exchanges a look, their usual chaotic energy starting to bubble back up. The lawyer, sensing he’s about to lose control of the room, quickly interjects.*

Jew Lawyer:
(warning)
Just… don’t do anything illegal. Or at least, don’t get caught.

*Dennis stands, buttoning his jacket.*

Dennis:
(confidently)
Don’t worry. We’ve got this.

*As they file out of the office, the lawyer sighs, shaking his head.*

Jew Lawyer:
(muttering)
Fuck. I’m gonna need a drink.

**Scene Transition:** The Gang walking out of the office, a renewed, albeit twisted, determination in their step.

**ACT 3 (CONT’D):** 

**INT. CREMATORIUM - NOON**

A modest crematorium. Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie stand awkwardly in front of the Cremator, a no-nonsense older man in a lab coat. He holds a small clipboard, looking over their limited options.

Cremator:
(pragmatic)
So, you want the basic cremation package?

Dennis:
(nodding)
Yeah, just the basics. We’re… working with a very tight budget.

Dee:
(under her breath)
Thanks to someone.

*Charlie shoots her a look, but before an argument can brew, the Cremator continues.*

Cremator:
Alright. We can handle the cremation, no problem. But about the urn…

*He pauses, flipping through his notes. The Gang leans in expectantly.*

Cremator:
(apologetically)
You don’t really have enough left for a traditional urn.

Mac:
(confused)
Well, what do you put the ashes in if there’s no urn?

*The Cremator, unfazed, gestures towards a nearby shelf. Among the urns and boxes is a plain, metal coffee tin. He picks it up, holding it out.*

Cremator:
We can put him in this. It’s… functional.

*The Gang stares at the coffee tin, processing the suggestion. Dennis is the first to speak.*

Dennis:
(incredulous)
A coffee tin? You want us to put Frank in a coffee tin?

Cremator:
(shrugging)
It’s economical. And honestly, it’s not the worst I’ve seen.

*Mac, trying to make the best of the situation, nods slowly.*

Mac:
(thoughtfully)
Frank did love coffee. He was always jittery, you know?

Dee:
(sarcastic)
Oh yeah, Mac, because this is **totally** about honoring his caffeine addiction.

Charlie:
(quietly, to himself)
He did say he wanted it cheap.

*The Cremator, sensing their reluctance, sets the coffee tin down on the counter.*

Cremator:
Look, it’s this or you leave him here and we bury him unmarked. Your choice.

*There’s a beat of silence. Dennis sighs, rubbing his temples.*

Dennis:
(resigned)
Fine. Coffee tin it is.

Dee:
(grumbling)
This is so goddamn embarrassing.

*The Cremator starts filling out paperwork as Mac picks up the tin, examining it closely.*

Mac:
(earnestly)
Maybe we can decorate it. You know, make it look nice.

Dennis:
(deadpan)
Yeah, Mac, because bedazzling a coffee tin will totally make this less weird! **NO!** We are not decorating the tin!!

*Charlie, still holding onto the idea of doing right by Frank, nods.*

Charlie:
(determined)
We’ll make it work. For Frank.

*The Cremator hands them the final form to sign.*

Cremator:
You’re all set. We’ll have the ashes ready by tomorrow.

*The Gang collectively sighs, the reality of the situation settling in as they glance once more at the coffee tin.*

**Scene Transition:** The Gang walking out of the crematorium, the coffee tin now a bizarre symbol of their love and dysfunction.

Every morning: I'm a coffee girlie. I buy the cold brew concentrate and blend 6 oz of that with one scoop of the Quest Cinnamon Crunch protein powder, then top with another vanilla protein shake and drink over ice. DELICIOUS. 50 grams of protein. 

Lunch/Snacks: I work from home and am in dumb zoom meetings from morning till afternoon, so not a lot of time for an actual meal, plus I'm not super hungry during the day anyway. I have been blending 10 oz of Fairlife Milk, one serving of frozen fruit (if you are lucky enough to have HEB where you live, these Blendables are AMAZING, come in so many flavors and are always on sale), and one scoop of protein powder. I've used unflavored, vanilla and now trying out this fruity pebbles one, they are all good in my opinion. Approx 40 grams of protein between the Fairlife milk and protein powder.

As for my collection of clear protein, I'm OBSESSED with this brand MyProtein! They taste the best of all the brands I've tried. I tried so hard to like the Isopure clear protein and they are not for me, but I see them being mentioned a lot, people love them. I usually go through 2 batches of these drinks in my 40 oz tumbler in a day, so around 80 grams of whey protein just from these. Myprotein runs a lot of great sales constantly, so keep your eyes peeled if you don't want to pay full price like me because this shit gets expensive. 

I usually eat one big meal at dinner, meats and veggies but all the things above have really helped to get me through the days ☺️",0,1736185008.0,Zepbound,3,0.5,False
1hv4nyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1hv4nyh/wedding_timeline_review_for_wisdom_feedback/,Wedding Timeline Review for Wisdom & Feedback (3:30-10:30),"Hi everyone! Looking for input from those who has been to more weddings and seen how this stuff actually plays out in real life! Anything you'd suggest? Considerations I'm not thinking of?

Notes:

\- Our ceremony and reception are all within the same venue, with about 120 guests. The ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception are in different spaces (albeit just different joining rooms), but I'm assuming a bit a of transition time is needed to actually shuffle 120 people over into the next room.

\- The wedding is in September where sunset is at 6:40 and dinner will be outside where temperatures can drop to \~55 degrees (there will be some space heaters, but still, I'm trying to maximize dinner during the warmer part of the day before the sun sets)

\- The wedding is on a Friday and about 1.5 hour drive for many guests from the city we live in to the city that the wedding is in. Hotel check-in starts at 3, and they've agreed to try to check-in guests earlier if some of the rooms are ready, but there's no guarantee, so I think many guests will just have to leave their luggage at the hotel desk and freshen up in the bathroom before taking the shuttle to the venue :/

3:00-3:30 We will ask that guests arrive between 3-3:30 for a ceremony that starts at 3:45 (shuttles from the hotel will run at 2:50 and 3:15)

3:45-4:00 Ceremony

4:00-4:10 Transition to cocktail hour (also allow spillover time from ceremony if it runs a little behind)

4:10-5:35 Cocktail hour (we're doing first look, so don't need to take formal pics during cocktail hour. Venue is at an estate with a small museum so guests will be able to roam and check out small number of exhibits)

5:35-5:45 Transition to seated dinner

5:45-7:15 Dinner and toasts (family-style served dinner with 3 courses: salad course, entree/sides, dessert/coffee)

7:15-7:30 Transition guests to outside patio where cake cutting and first dance will be

7:30-7:45 Cake cutting and first dance (skipping parent dances)

7:45-10:15 Dancing; last song at 10:15 (when should last call for drinks be? 9:45?). Shuttle starts running to take guests back to hotel at 9:00.

1hv4np8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hv4np8,Willow,"Celebrated my friend’s birthday at Willow! We were both pretty blown away with almost all the dishes. 

1st Pic- Black Chicken. This herbal consommé was perfect as it was rainy day. Warmed us up immediately. 

2nd Pic - Botanebi. This was a great amuse-bouche to start with. The shrimp infused with tomyum and plated on a mini meringue sang a symphony in my mouth. 

3rd Pic - Wing Bean with shuto. This was a lot more subtle than the first amuse-bouche. 

4th Pic - Chutoro. The fatty tuna with a spicy hit of gochujang hits different! 

5th Pic - Pain Au Lait with nori and airy butter with bonito flakes grounded into powder, was so good! 

6th Pic - Toro Sawara. This was absolutely divine! Not big on jalapenos at all, but I loved how it gave a little spicy kick here, and it was the perfect pairing with the belly of the Spanish mackerel, fennel, nashi pear and nori oil. 

7th Pic - Signature Amadai. I loved the play of textures here. The combination of the crispy scales, melt in your mouth daikon and fragrant scallop broth was so hearty and yet, exquisite. 

8th Pic - Monkfish Cheek. This was a safe dish with the XO sauce and kam heong. I personally prefer the Amadai over this, but my friend really liked this dish. 

9th Pic - Miyazaki Wagyu with confit potatoes. I really thought the smoked kampot pepper reduction sauce was so well-executed. 

10th Pic - Iberico with chestnut, coffee and watercress. Personally, I thought the pairings were a tad odd, especially the chestnut, but my friend liked it as well. 

11th Pic - Sakura Ebi. This was another favourite of ours! I loved how the tempura toppings added a playful crunch, and it was served two ways. We were told to eat this dry first, before adding the insanely tasty roasted fish and prawn broth to instantly turn it into a paofan. 

12th Pic - Green Apple. This smart palate cleanser. The candied celery with yuzu and mascarpone was light and refreshing. 

13th Pic - Sollies Fig. This was a pretty nostalgic walk down memory lane if you’re a millennial who loved your sweets. The peanut, prune and praline reminded me of kacung tumbuk, haw flakes and white rabbit. 

14th Pic - Requested and paid extra for a birthday cake for my friend. This was more of a crumble with berries and ice cream, but still the ultimate comfort food for rainy days. A little biased because I used to make this in winter when I was living overseas. 

15th Pic - Petit Four: Black Truffle Financier, Sesame Mochi, Choux (Kaya Toast). My favourite was the Choux! 

Overall, I thought it was a pretty cosy and intimate setting. I loved most of the dishes and thought it would be even better if the desserts had a little more Asian/Japanese twist to it for consistency. 

I chose to sit at the counter on purpose so we can watch the chefs prep the food. Service was mostly friendly. Chef Nicolas Tam can come across as a little aloof at times. Not that I minded, as I can understand it can get stressful and busy managing a whole team while churning food out.

one of the most beautiful men i have ever seen in my entire life, and i’m not being biased, every woman wanted him. i mean this man had the most beautiful dark brown hair, 5”11, beautiful smile with the cutest “bunny teeth”, chiseled jawline, big nose, great cheekbones, the hottest, muscly body ever. 

the sex was great, i mean great, every time we had sex it felt like we hadn’t seen eachother in months, (he never made me finish, but he tried his best to) 

he tried to understand me here and there

things were really good, when things were good, and things were rarely good.

he kept a whole folder of my “sexy” photos and only used that to get himself off, he was obsessed with my body, and he treated my body like it was sacred to him.

cons:

saw me once a week for 3-5 hours maximum.

never made me finish, but maybe that’s a me problem.

never treated me as priority, like at all.

never took me out anywhere for the last year of our relationship.

stopped writing me sweet messages and letters after a few months

rarely ever ever complimented me unless it was during sex, or if i asked him to compliment me lol.

hated spending money on me, even for a diet coke.

usually went 50/50 with me

didn’t drive, because he gave up on studying for the theory test.

thought deftones was insanely underground 

didn’t know who the rolling stones were after my dad said he knew ronnie wood.

i was  a little upset when he told me he started watching porn, and he told me “tough shit”

struggled to apologise for his wrongdoings, and always got defensive when we tried to communicate 

ditched me at my prom not even 2 hours in because he was “tired” while i stayed at his the whole night prior to mine.

his mother was practically in love with him, and she called me a gold digger when he bought me a coffee.

i have more but im not bothered writing more.

i miss him.

1hv4h3t,https://www.everettpost.com/local-news/everett-chamber-returns-hyperlocal-resources-for-businesses,Everett Chamber of Commerce Returns,"
Mon, January 6, 2025 by Mikayla Finnerty    

EVERETT, JAN. 6: The Greater Everett Chamber of Commerce has hit the ground running as they prepare for a future focused solely on the needs of businesses in the Everett area.

“For the first time in over 13 years, Everett will have a dedicated organization to foster business growth, advocate for pro-business policies, and elevate the region as a hub for innovation and economic opportunity,” an Everett Chamber flier said.

Everett Chamber CEO Wendy Poischbeg said the desire to bring back the Chamber stemmed from a need for programs and resources solely for businesses in the greater Everett area.

Jim Burnett, Real Estate Broker and long-time Everett resident joined the Mill Creek chamber last year because “Everett didn’t have a chamber”.

“Chambers are much needed for any city, especially the size of Everett. It just helps bring the community together. There are businesses that we don’t know exist and you learn about them as you network at Chamber meetings,” Burnett said.

Now, the Chamber plans to officially launch next week under the leadership of Poischbeg, who worked with the Economic Alliance of Snohomish County (EASC) as interim President and CEO.

In August Everett city council voted to allocate $600,000 from the American Rescue Plan Act to revive the Everett Chamber. The first Everett Chamber was established in 1892, and in 2011 merged with EASC.

The funds will be dispersed over three years until the Chamber is self-sufficient through membership fees and other revenue sources.

Poischbeg said that although funded by the city momentarily, they are separated from the government agency.

“I think it is important to note that this is a business organization. Even though the city provided some feed funding, we are separated from the city. And we are grateful for the city’s support, but we are also a business organization,” Poischbeg said.

Between the Downtown Everett Association (DEA) and the EASC, the Everett Chamber plans to be different in a few ways.

“The Downtown Everett Association is more business improvement and they have a prescribed area downtown… and Economic Alliance they are largely business attraction. We are much more about business retention and represent all of Greater Everett,” Poischbeg said.


Community members gather at the first informational session about the Everett Chamber at Milk House Coffee on Dec.10. Contributed by The Greater Everett Chamber of Commerce.
One question Poischbeg has received from a majority of business owners is, ‘How can we grow our business?’. Future programs plan to address achieving growth, marketing, networking, industry trends, and more.

“That’s how this Chamber will show up. We will be curating workshops, training and events that are not just random but are very strategic in order to give people the tools and resources to improve their business and grow,” Poischbeg said.

The first official event will be from 11:30 a.m.- 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 15 at APEX Everett. Participants will hear from APEX Everett owner Johnny Carswell, who owns the world’s largest graffiti and urban art collection on canvas. Tickets begin at $35 for members and $45 for non-members.

The monthly Wednesday lunches will be an opportunity to hear from industry leaders while networking with other businesses.

“The community has just been so supportive… they want to know exactly how the Chamber is going to be, helping to resolve barriers and grow business. We are going to hit 2025 off with a bang,” Poischbeg said.

On a whim (and because I had a coupon code), I purchased a discovery set from a random house on Etsy--""Nose of Gatsby.""

The discovery set is listed as coming with 2mL each of 10 fragrances, and there was actually an 11th fragrance in the box as well (with notes listed on the package insert):

\* Aura (Guaiacwood, Sandalwood, Cedar Forest, Frankincense, Gentle Touch)

\* Bespoke (Lavender, Sandalwood, Bergamot, Linen and Fabric, Oxygen, Steam)

\* Burning Piano (Burned Maplewood, Sandalwood, Copper Strains, Iris, Rose)

\* Double Espresso (Coffee Arabica, Bitter Chocolate, Cardamom, Rose, Oud, Seattle Air)

\* Fantome (Sandalwood, Black Pepper, Petitgrain, Fog, Mist, Shadow)

\* Naive (Black Tea, Incense, Rose, Tobacco, Fig, Sandalwood, Milk) -Sentimental (Rose, Rose Prick, White Rose, Myrrh, Geranium, Memory)

\* Single Shot (Yuzu, Sea Breeze, Gin, Ice and Salt, Pineapple, Eucalyptus, Sandalwood)

\* Superbloom (Rose de Mai, Jasmine, Orange Blossom, Bergamot Rind, Green Accord)

\*Tranquil (Pink Grapefruit, Bergamot, Orange Blossom, Green Accord-Nutmeg)

\*Triple Vanilla (Vanilla, Caramel, Waffle Cone, Hazelnut, Mysore Sandalwood, Jasmine)

It was $100, which is pretty steep for 20mL from a virtually unknown house, and probably should've been a red flag.

When the box arrived in the mail, the first thing I noticed is that it reeked of sandalwood. Like, through the mail packaging itself. Not a good sign--I'm not a sandalwood fan. I check the notes for the fragrances (and again, I bought this one on a whim and didn't do my research), and 6 of the 10 fragrances have sandalwood listed as a note. That one's on me, and I'm not going to penalize any fragrances for having sandalwood. I've smelled enough fragrances to know what sandalwood smells like when it's done well and done poorly, so I think I'm a fair judge. However, the smell of sandalwood radiating from literally everything in the package is so intense (I wonder if one of them leaked during shipping), that I have to keep it sealed in two layers of ziploc bags or else it makes whatever room it's in reek. But oddly enough--after smelling all the fragrances, none of them had that detectable sandalwood note that I was smelling. I later was wondering if maybe the perfumer spilled one of their sandalwood aromachemicals, or something like that.

Frankly the packaging leaves something to be desired--it's a cardboard box with the sample sprays just rattling around in some tissue paper. For $100 I have seen much, much better packaging. It comes with cards to spray it on, emblazoned with the nose of gatsby name and logo. The sample sprays also have a nice personalized label on them. The sample spray bottles are neither good nor bad, pretty standard.

Anyways, onto the smells. First, please note that I refer often to whether a fragrance is masculine- or feminine-leaning. This is not to say they are for men or women, but that there are certain ""styles"" that are generally associated as being more masculine or feminine, and I'm using that as shorthand here. All fragrances are unisex.

Also note that I do not comment on longevity or projection because I don't personally care about those, and because I sprayed on scent strips for the most part.

My overall review: a somewhat disappointing, overpriced houses. The perfumer excels most at feminine-leaning fragrances. The perfumer clearly has some talent but probably needs to spend more time on some of these. Overall their fragrances are a mix of pleasant but not groundbreaking, very wearable feminine fragrances; a couple blah masculine fragrances; and two fairly challenging, artistic but unpleasant and unwearable fragrances.

\* Aura: 3/10. Poorly blended, extremely muddy, amateurish. I could not pick out notes, it just smells like what I've smelled from beginner hobbyist perfumers who use way too many notes. It just smells like masculine-leaning, olfactory white noise with an overall woody angle. It gets a 3/10 because it wasn't overtly offensive, it was just--nothing. I think the perfumer was attempting to balance out their fragrances by offering a more everyday masculine-leaning fragrance, but this misses the mark.

\* Bespoke: 7/10. The best masculine-leaning one of the bunch. I actually do pick up something almost like a steam accord in it. A decent, elegant male fragrance.

\* Burning Piano: 2/10. Well, the name is accurate. If you've ever been near a wildfire region--when the forests are burning, the smell at first is honestly a pleasant, fireplace smell. The next day or two after, it turns into the most overwhelming, awful, burnt smell. That is this. I sprayed it on a sample strip. It is incredibly strong. I immediately picked it up, walked outside, and threw it in my garbage can because I didn't even want it inside. It gets 2 points for being accurately named, artistic perfumery, but is nothing I would ever want to smell again.

\* Double Espresso: 2/10. An incredibly acrid coffee smell. Hard to describe, unpleasant to smell. It's almost interesting in how acrid it is--like a coffeehouse forgot to take the beans out of the roaster or something. Unique, but absolutely unwearable. Masculine-leaning.

\* Fantome: 6/10. A pleasant, but muddy feminine fragrance. Light, airy, and I can't pick up much more than that.

\* Naive: 5/10. I do get a bit of the tea notes, etc, but overall it came across a bit muddy to me. Feminine-leaning. Pleasant though.

\* Sentimental: 6/10. Another vaguely pleasant, feminine-leaning, light fragrance. Floral with an emphasis on roses.

\* Single Shot: 7/10. Vaguely fruit candy. Smells a bit like opening a bag of Pez or something, and was fairly interesting. Dries down to a fairly standard, pleasant coconut. Feminine-leaning.

\* Superbloom: 7/10. A pleasant, well-blended, light floral. I think this would be very very nice during spring and summer; it's not particularly unique, but it's just overall well-done. The most wearable in the discovery set.

\* Tranquil: 6/10. I get mainly bergamot and orange blossom. Pleasant, feminine-leaning.

\* Triple Vanilla: 8/10. Smells like buttered popcorn mixed with vanilla. The best of the bunch. Feminine leaning, quite pleasant",4,1736184298.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

Started at 30 mg and now on 50, for ADHD and BED. I've never been on a stimulant before, but was on Prozac and Clonazepam for about 10 years.

I am having a difficult time knowing if this is the correct medication for me. Recently asked for the increase because even though it does feel like it's helping a bit, it doesn't feel like it's enough? Not quite sure.

I don't have any of the negative side effects, which I was initially worried about. My blood pressure has actually come down to normal from being high before Vyvanse. I don't get jittery, anxiety has almost disappeared completely, no insomnia (actually am able to stay asleep all night and get more than 5-6 hours of sleep now). 

But..what the medication is actually supposed to be doing, doesn't feel very strong.
Some days I can focus better, some days my focus is zero. I seem more clear and concise in general, and much less chronic fatigue and executive dysfunction, but..maybe my expectations were too high? I'm still struggling with BED, especially at night, and on days I'm not at work, I very much struggle to focus on things I want to get done like exercise and chores, not just get sucked into my phone and laze around.

No matter the dose, it seems to wear off for me so fast. Like 5-6 hours max. 
I have acquaintances who are on much lower doses and have so much energy and zest now... increasing their dosage made them feel like they were on speed, was too much for them, and lasts all day. 

I'm experimenting with diet, exercise, magnesium, a lot of the tips and tricks I see online. Nothing seems to really make a huge difference, except now I don't need 5 coffees a day just to keep my eyes open. 

I don't know. Just looking for advice and insight mostly. 

For context I'm a 30 year old woman living in Canada. It's winter right now so maybe when the warm weather comes around, I'll feel better. 

Also, I did/do have bradycardia. Before Vyvanse, my RHR at night would dip into the low 40's. Now it's mid 50's to low 60's. Which seems like a good thing? But I can't find any information online to determine if it is or not. I am seeing my Dr again in March, although she doesn't seem worried about it. ",1,1736184251.0,VyvanseADHD,4,1.0,False

I love the public transportation and coffee scene. Other than some racism (due to people being hypervigilant), I have found the general vibe of the city to be depressing. Friendly people are hard to come by. Even when people are nice they aren't exuberant. In Boulder, I found that even old people had a bouncy energy. I lived in Boulder for a little over eight years - and it helped me get over a lot of the trauma of growing up in the poorer areas of NYC. That childlike forever athlete energy breathed so much energy into my life. 

Little things like gyms not opening until 5 am adds the sort of friction to my day that makes me feel tired (I used to go to Boulder's Crunch Fitness at 4:15 am). Being surrounded by introverts makes me feel socially exhausted because I try to strike up conversations and create connection but people don't seem interested.

The root of this is that I had a large group of parkour/tricking friends, and an even larger community, with lots of random friends that were peripheral to those athletic communities. In SF proper there are like ... three people that do my sport. There is a meetup in the greater bay area but that requires either a car or more than two hours of public transportation time.

Growth can be extremely fast the first few years! Blue was my 1st iguana and I definitely made mistakes the first year having her! My major mistake was dealing with enclosures! I wasted so much money buying and decorating them when I should've put that money into a vet nest egg (which you most definitely should have and learn about Care Credit) She was a Craigslist buy and came with a 75g tank. One of the first things I learned is iguanas don't belong in tanks! At the time we were fostering and doing end of life care for ferrets who weren't able to be adopted. That way they could pass in a home environment and not a shelter. We had a lot of ferret nation cages! Her first enclosure was a double cage that ended up being a 2 double cages put together with no inner walls or floors. We live in a smaller house and at that time she was always wanting to out so I spent about 2 weeks and potty trained her (sorta) and we moved from the ferret cages to the $220 cat tree. That was a huge fail! Most of it was unusable for an iguana. Free roaming was surprisingly completely normal and we continued it. I had a beaded dragon at the time and made a enclosure out of a vintage coffee table. We chucked most of the cat tree out and incorporated both into one set up. Fast forward to my dragon going to live with my friend because I was hopeless on bonding with my dragon. I overcompensated with bugs trying to get her to love me and ended up with a over weight dragon. I learned my area is iguana only! Blue's new set up was the back of my couch looking out the window. We ran her light and she enjoyed it. Magnus entered the picture and joined the motley crew and with him being male and reading about how breeding season can be extremely tricky and kinda dangerous and his previous enclosure being horrible I opted to get a catio! I think the price was around $300. He loves it and so do I! Unfortunately Blue also loved it, but we don't cohab so I got her a smaller version of a catio since she free roams. She snubbed it and I thankfully was able to sell it. 

All that money, time, and stress I wasted on enclosures is mind blowing! If I could hop in the DeLorean with Doc Brown I'd tell myself to just buy the damn catio and be done with it! They're spacious, easy to assemble and disassemble if you have to relocate, hold up well, and for the time span you'll use them are worth the money. ",2,1736184164.0,iguanas,0,1.0,False

But I do not feel like the preparation was a waste, as I want to carry that level of proficiency through the rest of my career. 

If you are already a good test taker, skip the next paragraph. 

I can see why this exam might be harder for those who are not good at taking tests, or those who don’t read carefully. Thankfully, I’m already a very good test taker and read every word in full. Which is really all the advice you need for most of the exam questions: read the prompts fully, and examine all of the answers taking care to understand why the words that were specifically used in the prompt were used and what that should mean. An example might be the prompt asking for commands that does several things and asks to add a secure method to login on the vty lines (I did not actually have any questions about this specific topic, and I would not disclose any specific questions I had as per the rules of the exam), and all the answers might include a string of many commands but only one might include allowing only ssh on the vty. 

Resources I used to prepare: Jeremy’s IT Lab including flash cards, Boson X-Sim. 

How I prepared: I watched all of JITL in about 45 days, then the holidays kind of blew my schedule by about four weeks, and I finally took the first boson exam and got a 78 last week. I panicked and thought I wasn’t prepared enough, so I reviewed every question - not just the ones I missed. I did the next practice exam and got an 85. Then did all of Jeremy’s lab videos over the weekend because Boson’s labs marked me wrong (even though I know I had some of them right) and partly to hammer home the commands. I did not do the mega lab, but will still do it this week just to practice more because I actually want to be good at this. I started Boson exam C last night but only got about thirty questions in on study mode before I was tired and losing focus. Decided to hit the hay early so I could wake up and have breakfast and coffee before the test.

When I make the foam, the machine shows quite a bit of foam.  However, when I drink it, it tastes like Nespresso shot + hot milk mixed, different from the taste I get at Starbucks / cafe, where I can taste the foam.  

What I notice also when I finish my drink is that the foam and creamy portion just stays at the top, and what I actually drink is just the coffee + milk mix rather than the foam taste altogether.  I even tried to use the Starbucks cup to see if that makes a difference- unfortunately that isn't the case. 

I use 2% milk.  The title and description might sound a bit silly, but hopefully some can enlighten me on what I can do to improve the taste.  Thank you!",0,1736183937.0,nespresso,5,0.5,False

—
DH and I have been in a relatively good place with the in-laws lately. Heck — when I learned they were passing through town last minute in November, I even offered for them to stay with us. I also attended an event with my MIL. We were as good as we were going to get. 

And, for years, my MIL has been pushing to have her two sons and their families “all together” at the holidays. This year, she got her wish for Thanksgiving. She would not allow me to bring food, so instead I made two beautiful flower arrangements — one for MIL and one for GMIL. I truly love flower arranging, so this was enjoyable for me. But I’ll admit that I dumbly splurged quite a bit. Peonies, roses, etc. 

During our 6-hour drive to her house, DH called his uncle’s family and arranged to meet them for dinner. We did not notify MIL. She doesn’t like that side of the family, inexplicably.

After dinner, when we arrived at MIL’s house, she had already “heard” via family that we were meeting the uncle for dinner. She gave us the cold shoulder and did not get up from the couch, initially… Clearly ticked off. I’m standing there holding a massive bouquet — and she didn’t even acknowledge it at first. LOL. Then she commented that it was pretty and sat it on the table. 
The next day, during Thanksgiving dinner, I noticed that the bouquet was MIA. She didn’t put it on the coffee table, fireplace hearth, etc…. She moved it all the way to the office… not on the desk… but on the floor. It stayed there all day, until at night I noticed that she put it back on the table. So I let it go.

Fast forward to Christmas. My DH and I were going on a big vacation and asked her if our dog could stay with her. We planned to deliver him, have Xmas dinner with his parents, then head to the airport. However, during Thanksgiving, we’d noticed that MIL’s corgi was being extremely aggressive towards our pup (who is very laid back). DH and I reevaluated and told MIL that we’d find another place for our dog to stay during our vacation. 
So, no longer needing to transport our dog, there was really no sense in us driving 6 hours before our flight… Additionally, we would have had to retrieve our car OTW back from vacation and repeat that drive. 12 hours driving for one dinner was just too much — on top of the stress of a holiday vacation, too. My DH explained this to MIL: we would not be coming for early-Christmas. She acted like this was totally fine.

But, on our vacation, we tried to stream a TV show. We use her login for Netflix, and in turn, she uses ours for a few other streaming apps. It’s reciprocal. 
Since we are the only ones that she password-shares with, she has always used my husband’s name as the password. For almost 15 years now.
So when the password didn’t work, we texted her to let her know. She replied that she made a new password — it was older brother’s name. Lol.
Also, I had just logged in a couple weeks ago, so it’s safe to say that she changed her password after we broke off Xmas plans.
My husband and I got quite a laugh out of this.

However, on Xmas day, she never called or texted him. While out sightseeing, I think he assumed that she would’ve checked in — or at least texted Merry Christmas. As the day went on and we heard from various family, he commented that he hadn’t heard from his parents. He said he’d shoot them a message when we got back to the hotel that night, but I could tell that he was sad. He shook it off… but out of all of her childish holiday spite, she finally succeeded in making me really angry. 

The irony in all this is that, after several years, she finally got her family “all together” for a holiday… We were all in a good place. She could’ve just soaked that in and tried to be happy for a bit. But she truly cannot help herself.

Motherboard: ASRock B450m/ac ([Documentation](https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B450Mac/#Specification))

BIOS: 10.31 Beta

CPU (old):  AMD Ryzen 1600 AF

CPU (new): AMD Ryzen 5700x3d

CPU Cooling: BeQuiet! Pure Rock 2 (Black)

PSU (old): Corsair CX450M

PSU (new): Corsair RM650 

RAM: Corsair DDR4 , 8GB x 2, 3200 MHz (Corsair Vengeance)

GPU: EVGA RTX 2060

OS: Windows 11

I initially changed to AM4 for future upgrades, now on the last upgrade before I change to AM5. 

Before swapping CPU's from the 1600AF to the 5700X3D, I noted my PSU was at 386 / 450W which didn't leave room for future GPU upgrades. Also noted I'd need a BIOS update for the new chip.

I decided to do 'incremental' upgrades to make sure each stage / part worked. 

Updated the BIOS, booted into Windows. 

Swapped out the PSU's afterwards, made sure the new PSU boot up into Windows as well.

Uninstalled Ryzen stock cooler and old CPU, put in new CPU and Cooler.

When I plugged it all back in, the PC would boot up for 30 seconds and then shut off, repeat indefinitely. 

I went to sleep to fix it this morning - after googling how to troubleshoot it properly on my phone. Since it wasn't outputting any video / black screen I figured it was RAM issue, so tried experimenting with the RAM configurations.

Both RAM sticks work in Slot A2 on their own, but when I boot with them in Dual Channel (A2 / B2) it goes back into the boot looping / black screen. 

I'm getting ready to troubleshoot some more, finishing my morning coffee. Currently posting from the machine with 1 stick of RAM installed.

Do I have to manually configure the RAM timings? Once I got back up and into the BIOS with the 1 stick of RAM I saw the Memory settings were all changed back to 'Auto' so I loaded back up my old XMP profile thinking it would fix the problem, but both sticks of RAM still didn't boot.

I also read that the CPU Cooler could be mounted too tightly, where the tension causes the board to flex. 

Any help is appreciated, going to start my next round of troubleshooting in like 30 minutes. I'm just looking for feedback or different perspective on things to try.",1,1736183840.0,buildapc,3,1.0,False

**Background:**

SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE last year celebrated their first 10 years as a band. And unless you read any interviews or press releases from them in the last year or two, you probably wouldn’t have realized that it almost never happened. After some inner band turmoil after the release of *ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH*, the band was on the verge of calling it quits. But instead, the trio picked up the pieces, shredded them even further, and put them all back together for their most realized and compelling work yet. But what the hell was this turmoil in the first place? Well let’s go back to 2014 and see how we got here.

Released the same year they formed, SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE’s somewhat self-titled debut is a fascinating document in a lot of ways. While a lot of folks now probably associate Zack Schwartz with SOTB, in 2014 he was simply the Glocca Morra guy, and so any fans of that band probably came into this record with a little bit of shock. “This is what the guy who made [*Just Married*](https://gloccamorradied.bandcamp.com/album/just-married-2) is making now?” certainly has to have come out of the mouth of at least one music fan when listening to *The Spirit of the Beehive*. But for Schwartz, SOTB wasn’t a side project but simply his next artistic endeavor.

However, it wasn't just an endeavor for Schwartz and Schwartz alone. From the beginning, it was conceived as a project for Schwartz and his partner, Rivka Ravede. Despite both of them growing up in Florida, their paths didn’t cross until Schwartz had moved up to Philadelphia with his Glocca Morra bandmates. And when Schwartz realized Glocca Morra was winding down, he immediately turned to Ravede. They were already dating and living together so fuck it, why not start a band too?

With Schwartz serving as the band’s frontman and Ravede as their bassist/co-vocalist, the two forged a path through the Philly music scene with a rotating cast of musicians for a few years, releasing a number of albums and EPs like *You Are Arrived (But You’ve Been Cheated)*, *Pleasure Suck* and *Hypnic Jerks* that would go on to become extremely beloved in certain music circles, but especially *Hypnic Jerks* as there’ll probably be one person in this thread who still regards that as their musical peak.

Soon after the release of *Hypnic Jerks*, the band brought on Corey Wichlin, a multi-instrumentalist from Chicago. After a year or so of steady touring, Wichlin’s role in the band would change rapidly, as during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, he became the sole other member remaining in the band aside from Schwartz & Ravede. But the trio didn’t have time to grieve (if there was anything to grieve in the first place, since the band’s lineup was never all that solid & it was an amicable split between the members that left), and remotely put together their fourth album, the abrasive & sampledelic *ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH* that while thematically wasn’t all that different from their previous records, was a giant sonic leap for the band that broke them through to a bigger audience in the moment, not after the fact like with *Hypnic Jerks* and its steady rise as a cult classic. 

But as is the case sometimes when a band appears to be celebrating a new level of success, things weren’t so upsy daisy in SOTB’s world, as after nearly a decade together, Ravede & Schwartz ended their relationship. Lots of questions came about in the midst of this breakup, but one of which they both had was wondering if SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE was gonna be a band anymore. In the meantime, Schwartz got to work on a new draag me album, the solo project he created in 2019. But once again, Schwartz didn’t want to go at it alone, as he brought Wichlin onto the project, turning it into a duo and eventually releasing *lord of the shithouse* in 2023.

After some failed attempts to regroup, eventually the trio reconvened after some time passed and Ravede & Schwartz both had moved on to new relationships. But there were still some things to hash out, and so out of these new sessions came the *i’m so lucky* EP, a test of sorts to not only see if they could still be a band, but write in a way they had never truly written before as a band: autobiographically. While there is of course an inherent abstraction to SOTB’s music I doubt they’ll ever fully shake, it’s now matched with a level of sincerity in Schwartz’s lyrics/songwriting that he hadn’t tapped into in nearly a decade. The real gut punch of the EP comes with its final track, “natural devotion 2”, a sequel song to the *You Are Arrived (But You’ve Been Cheated)* track that changes that song’s fiction to non, as Ravede, Schwartz and even Wichlin’s voices go back and forth, eventually meshing together for a bittersweet end.

**Write-Up by** u/ReconEG:

That bittersweet end proved to be the beginning of a new direction for the band, and so they quickly got to work on the album we are finally talking about today, *YOU’LL HAVE TO LOSE SOMETHING*. If *i’m so lucky* was the band testing the waters of being alarmingly direct, then this album is them driving into the river. But maybe you wouldn’t have felt that right away with the LP’s first single “LET THE VIRGIN DRIVE”, a track that by name alone feels like a response to “I SUCK THE DEVIL’S COCK”, but in composition feels vastly different to that song’s pure chaos.

*YOU’LL HAVE TO LOSE SOMETHING* was initially advertised as the band going in a more poppy direction, but you can barely hear that here at first. Upon multiple listens though, its layers peel back a bit more to reveal a much more controlled chaos than anything on their last record, and a clearer vision of songcraft compared to their early works. Beyond the intra-band changes, this was also the first album they recorded at their new studio, as it turns out you might have a clearer head for song creation when you’re not recording in a freezing cold studio popping a ton of adderall or at home swapping files. 

And lyrically, Schwartz’s approach hasn’t changed all that much on the surface, but there is much to be read in the subtext. Compared to the lyrical contributions Ravede and Wichlin make, Schwartz’s headspace here is especially dark as he imagines himself as a stalker and kidnapper, with Ravede and Wichlin (in hilarious, overblown autotune) portraying the external and internal sides of this tale. 

Though the content of what Schwartz says on this album is largely dark, the way he says it fully exposes the melodic gifts he’s possessed since the beginning of this band, but with a bigger and grander spotlight thanks to the production job he and Wichlin do on this record. Pretty consistently, you could hear me humming something from this album since I heard it a few months ago, and usually it’s something that Schwartz is singing or something he wrote.

The double hitter of “SOMETHING’S ENDING” and “I’VE BEEN EVIL” that served as the second released slice of the full album is one of the album’s most ominous moments thematically. Yet, this is one of its lightest musically with “I’VE BEEN EVIL” in particular; a little ditty in comparison to much of the album that feels fairly at home with some of the material off of *Hypnic Jerks*. In the song, the evil Schartz talks about are the evils we do to ourselves that spill out to the evils we do to others. For him, this is sweeping under rugs instead of picking up the dirt & dust himself. For others, his “buddy at work” he mentions, it’s bringing a gun to their workplace and saying he’s gonna “use it once”, as Schwartz wonders what would happen if he were the one who had the trigger pulled onto him. Evil takes many, many forms, and not caring is one of them.

Despite *YOU’LL HAVE TO LOSE SOMETHING* being described by the band as a less antagonistic album compared to their previous works, this is still SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE. They’re going to find ways to antagonize you. Part of it is in how direct some of the lyrics are (the band have plainly described this album as a breakup album, and you hear it clearly), and some of it is simply the songs themselves, whether that’d be MSPAINT’s DeeDee’s harsh interruption on the appropriately named opener “THE DISRUPTION”, or “THE CUT DEPICTS THE CUT”, an eruptive, industrial cut on what’s otherwise a record a little softer on the ears (relatively of course). 

One of the softer cuts on the first half of the record comes in the form of “FOUND A BODY”, the first full song Ravede brought to the band ever, that Ravede [describes](https://www.thefader.com/2024/08/23/spirit-of-the-beehive-youll-have-to-lose-something-interview) as “being nostalgic and looking back at the past and mistakes that I made, just kind of like watching it like a movie in my head.” I think a lot of folks can relate to feeling like a passenger in your own life, watching life like you’re not the one in control of it all, and this track presents an airy, loose sort of feel that brings you into that headspace.

While the band have said that not every song here is about the breakup, though it definitely hangs over significant portions of the album, there is one song here that absolutely is about the breakup, no questions asked. It’s the most direct song this band has ever made. There is little to no metaphors or even similes to be found here. Hell, the one time the song tries to pull that off it sounds like the most depressing fucking thing ever, and it is. And that’s “1/500”, a late in the game gut punch that turns all the subtext into text, and it’s maybe the best song this band has ever made. It’s also the most that Schwartz has probably tapped back into his past life as a songwriter, but it turns Glocca Mora’s sincere snark into heartbreaking sadness. Any words I’m typing here don’t do justice to what’s on the page, as hearing Schwartz open his heart up like this feels like seeing a normally guarded loved one cry for the first time. Standalone? The song is devastating. In the context of the album? It’s even more so. And in the context of the entire band? Don’t even get me started.

The band levels up in a lot of ways on this album, but I think the biggest showcase of the evolution of this band comes at the end of this album, “EARTH KIT.” When the band started, Schwartz just wanted to write My Bloody Valentine-style shoegaze & dream pop songs. Now he’s writing a string section with Wichlin to help resolve a melody of a string quartet he heard at his girlfriend’s sister’s wedding. And yet, this doesn’t feel out of place at all within the album, or even the band’s history. Schwartz always wanted to do something completely different to Glocca Morra, and this is still pretty god damn different, even more so now maybe.

But Schwartz, Wichlin and Ravede do more than resolve a melody of a string quartet, but resolve the melody of the band at large. After Ravede and Schwartz’s breakup, SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE could have been well and done, and left themselves with a solid legacy of influence on the Philly indie scene and great albums. But instead, they preserved and came back with what I think is their strongest record yet, and a path forward for the band. I would have said a clear path but nothing is ever very clear in SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE’s world. If anything’s clear though, it’s that while they might have lost something going into this record, they clearly gained so much more. It might take some time though to find out what that more’s gonna be.

**Favorite Lyrics:**

>Devotion is a cancer, a stone that’s falling endlessly

* “STRANGER ALIVE”

>Face keeps changing while channel surfing past the immovable beast; the daily rot

* “SORRY PORE INJECTOR”

>A buddy brought a gun to work

>Says he’s gonna use it once

>I wonder how close we are…

>And yet I also oh…

>Bye to my problems, bye

>Goodbye to the void

>Maybe it would be quick to cross the threshold

* “I’VE BEEN EVIL”

>Every night is a joke

>Face now feels light

>Crumbles like coffee cake

>Any move I can make I would have already made

>Practiced some speak I felt like I’d mean but what if I don’t?

>I can’t stop time but I need it to be on my side

>I have a body that I won’t itch

>I can’t change, I’m already it

>In a race against my own mind to fix what can not be fixed

>What can not be fixed can not be

>(Nobody left to keep the score when we both supernova)

>What if a photo doesn’t capture time?

>(I let the needle run, I know it could be now or nеver)

>I have a love that is on my mind and it feels likе everyone

>(Feels like the waiting, how pathetic, it’s a car crash)

>Feels like an apparition I can touch

>Put me in the back, put me back in the corner of your mind

>(A couple nights on the phone)

>(Another year spent with the television)

>(It’s just a mirror and it’s-)

>Looking back at me; our old house, faulty light switch

>I check it

>It’s off, it’s off, it’s off

* “1/500”

>I don’t wanna live no more

>Not if I have to speak

>My body sped up past me

>Speed wouldn’t allow more

>A letter read to your ears

>And it sounds like I sing

>You’ll never get close to me

>You’ll have to lose something

* “EARTH KIT”

**Talking Points:**

* How does this album compare to the rest of SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE’s discography?
* I’ve heard a number of their fans not gel with *ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH*, so what do you think about the sonic evolution of this band?
* In making the album, the band attempted to go for a less antagonistic and poppy sound, do you think they succeeded?
* “1/500”, right?
* And finally, where does *YOU’LL HAVE TO LOSE SOMETHING* land on your 2024 AOTY list?

For context, we are a family with two teens. We travel to see and try new things. We are not ""luxury"" travelers.

* We got a great price on a condo at WorldMark Kona through VRBO. It was a great location and clean. Beds were comfortable. We didn't use the pool so I can't comment on that, but we would definitely stay there again.
* Daytime snorkeling and Manta Ray night snorkeling through Fair Wind was top-notch. Professional crew, spotless boat, delicious food. I would 100% recommend Fair Wind. We did the smaller group for day snorkeling.
* We have used GuideAlong in the past for car tours, but used the Shaka guide this time. We loved it! The addition of the music was a fun upgrade from GuideAlong. We were able to see a lot of places on the island we might have missed.
* Driving along the north coast was beautiful and I absolutely recommend it!
* You can watch the sunset and stars from the visitor center level on Mauna Kea without paying a guide to go to the very top. The experience is amazing!!
* The best coffee we had was at Kona Coffee and Tea!
* We stayed 3 nights at a VRBO in Hawaiian Paradise Park on the Hilo side. This was a great location for us to explore Volcanoes National Park.
* We spent 2 full days in the National Park, but we are hikers and explorers. Pele also gave us an incredible show, so we went at night too. It was absolutely amazing!! Be sure to drive all the way down to the Holei arch and use the Shaka guide.
* We loved our meal at Pineapples Island in Hilo!
* The only part of the Big Island that was overhyped IMO is Punaluʻu Beach. It was crowded, the bathrooms were filthy, there was only 1 turtle, and it did not feel worth the drive. I know others love it, but we did not feel the magic there that we were expecting. Yes, the black sand is cool, but we also saw black sand at Pololū valley beach and THAT was an incredibly beautiful place on the island and worth the visit.
* Overall, we had an incredible trip and are SO glad we went to the Big Island!",7,1736183556.0,VisitingHawaii,1,1.0,False

I hope all are having a positive beginning of 2025.
 I'm taking keppra 2 tablets twice a day and vimpat 1/2 tab in the morning and 1 tablet  at night. 

I preface this by I was being knocked out by taking these meds  and my seizure specialist told me to take half of my vimpat tablet in the morning but I still feel sleepy and drowsy although not being completely knocked out. It's worse when I don't drink coffee. Has anyone experienced this? 

The plan so far is next time I see him depending on how I'm doing to also half the night vimpat. However I wonder if it's the vimpat or the keppra? I will note that I don't get drowsy or sleepy in the late evening/night dose.

Went to sleep after the dosage as i work nights. woke up and i wasnt feeling as hungry. was wary of how this hunger suppression works, but its just the feeling that your not hungry. i thought it was going to be something else.

by evening time i didnt feel hungry at all. i usually made 4 slices of bread at work to eat during work. made them as usual just in case. In the end that day i had 1 slice but i do think that was from habit more than hunger. I tend to snack and drive and there still is that feeling i should have my mouth moving so i've switched to chewing gum, pumpkin seeds and little mint sugar free sweets. 

Coffee was the big issue for me. it used to dry my mouth before this and so i stopped taking coffee and switched to tea but havent got a tea that i like. 

I usually drink lots of water as it is - i carry a 1ltr bottle and usually pop in some cordial. i've been drinking that during my shift. 

taking some multivitamins and vit d. 

very happy with the 8lbs - i can feel it on my body esp on the fatty area's. moobs have gone down, i can feel my thighs slimmer too. 

Bit of a side note - feeling alot colder too. i'm normally ok with cold weather but feet and hands get cold quicker. usually find myself wearing a fleece now. doesnt help that the bloody snow decided to come down this week. 

its been nice not get that sugar high/low affecting me. i used to find i'd feel groggy at times and would have one of the slices of bread to keep me up or snack on some crisps.

I was thinking this is different than airlines or hotels, but even for them, you earn points when you spend. But maybe not as large an amount?

Anyway, the specifics:

I need to buy a printer.  It costs $100.  

I can

1) use $100 of points to buy it. And yeah, I have over $1K of points with staples so that does come into the math - will I ever use all the points?

2) Buy the printer for $100.  And that earns me another $50 of points for a future purchase.

I know from the few times I use airline points, it's a nusance of trying to figure what a point is worth and how many points this flight will require and is this a good use of the points vs. some other flight I might take in the future.

But here, $1 of points is $1 of points. So it's a little simpler? But I am still stuck.

I suppose if I had millions of dollars of points, using them rather than buy the printer makes sense.  And again, I do have over $1K of points.  not sure if I will ever use all those points at staples.

But is it wrong to think - the effective cost of the printer is $50 if I buy it (cause I'll have $50 to spend later).  So is $100 of points worth using for a $50 printer? I COULD use the $100 in points for $100 of coffee pods, packaging products, etc..

I’ve have had recurrent stomach problems for a few months now. I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy 2 years ago due to blood on my stool and only internal hemorrhoids were found. In my colonoscopy, they tested for celiac disease and chrons but i apparently had neither. I was diagnosed with chronic superficial gastritis with hiatal hernia 2 years ago. 

Symptoms got better over time but recently in the last few months I have new symptoms like loss of appetite, occasional nausea, super bad fatigue, bloating after eating, unusual burping after eating and lots of trapped gas, random sharp stomach pains, and lower abdomen bellow belly button area pressure that is almost constant. I haven’t had the best of diet ever really and it mostly consists of coffee, milk, chicken, and snacks

I recently went to the gastro doctor again 5 months ago and got a 2nd endoscopy due to my symptoms being worse and was told I had mild inflammation and my hiatal hernia was still present, 4 biopsies were taken and no H Pylori. A few days ago I noticed I had been having cold hands and feet so I went to the doctor and they said my cbc was normal but I had mild iron deficiency as my ferritin was 27. My Hemoglobin was normal so was the rest of the iron panel. 

I insisted on getting a CT scan as the doctors thought it could be appendix related but the CT with contrast was completely unremarkable with nothing not even any inflamed lymph nodes seen.

I’m now more concerned that they could’ve missed something in the 2nd endoscopy. Any suggestions or insight appreciated!",1,1736182967.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Well long story, so strap in, grab a hot tea or coffee cuz there is much Tea to tell.

To start off I have socially come out to all my friends and work in August 2024, and I've been very lucky to be accepted with lots of love and support by them. I have lost my previous partner around the same time as me coming out due to many reasons but also because they didn't want to date a her, but a him and the more I exploded my true self the more distant we became. They were not transphobic I should mention, rather they helped me learn lots of things and have always supported me.

So for months I was dealing with losing my partner of 4 years which I still love to this day, I thought of ways to tell my parents and maybe family, I am born in Bulgaria and you can already tell even without googling that anything LGBT+ does not fly there. I am glad to be able to work and live in the UK but my parents and family are all still in Bulgaria. As such when I came out to a few very close friends they needed some time to learn and understand what it is to be Trans and all. 

The days went by and here I am visiting my family for Christmas and all (boymoding ofc), and thought it's the best time for me to let them know, so after all festivities are gone and allowing them to have a good time with their child, I knew they'd take the news bad so I wanted them to have a good holiday period. Anyways, after all that I sat then down and have told them all about who I am and my identity, why I am and how, all the questions. My mother spoke most out of the two, my dad just remained silent and agreed with my mom. My mom's initial reaction was ""you're not getting gender reassignment surgery are you” to which I said it's not in the plans (it is). Then she asked why have I told others and that it was a mistake to be so ""honest""... I continued to explain that I've changed my name and all people in the UK that I know and care for are super cool with me. Disapprovingly she asked me more similar questions as ""why would you do that"". They seemed to be allowing things to be in their own way untill I mentioned HRT...that's when they hit a hard NO and for days now are not budging on considering to understand it, let alone accept it.

So I guess I can't wait to fly back to the UK and hope that they maybe accept me. They still refer to me as ""him"" and have never mentioned my name, continue to deadname me. They're on the wave of ""you didn't meet the right person"" or ""you didn't get much love so you're looking for it in the wrong place"". As I am writing this my mom has sent me a post on how to be masculine...so I hope you all lovely people have had a better end to your holidays than I did.

I got mad and rebooted the game to restart the day, and luckily, Jojo appeared as the closer as normal. My question is, has anyone experienced something similar? Maybe in another Gameria, or only in Mocharia? Is there a reason why this happened?",2,1736182505.0,flipline,0,0.75,False
1hv3miv,https://i.redd.it/f7zqz9bxlebe1.png,How I study for almost perfect scores on finals.,"During finals I 'study' maybe 3 to 5 a day, including study groups, which means it's including a lot of side convos and goofing off. 

If you have friends who are pretty serious about school, it makes studying a lot more fun (and effective imo because you teach and get taught) to study with a friend group. Just go to a restaurant or coffee shop together and bring your backpacks. I'm not sure how long it really takes. Studying as a group just feels like hanging out, so I'm not usually too worried about how long it's taking.

Before you go, print any reviews you have and do as much as you can on your own, leaving any questions that you're struggling with or just have questions on blank to do with your group. Then go through the packet with your group, discussing together why each answer is right (even for ones you all got right) and explain problems people didn't get until they can do it, too. This way you get solo practice and don't have to feel stressed at all about getting stuck, which is a pretty big deal, since frustration seems to be what makes studying so hard.

Then, for social studies (or any subject with a lot of memorization) make a quizlet, blooket, or flashcards together and test each other. Set ones you get wrong aside and go until you get them all right. Then do the whole thing again. Repeat that until you can get them all right in one go. 

For math, make AI give you more problems on stuff any of you didn't understand while doing the review. Ask for help for ones you're even a little confused on.

Once you've done all of that for the subjects you have tomorrow, you can talk about other things and goof off until you're ready to leave.",5,1736182489.0,highschool,0,0.86,False

i met my partner just over 2 years ago on bumble (i know, sigh). coming off the pandemic was hard for me, week before the world shut down i’d ended a four year relationship with the person i thought id spend my life with. it had become dull, stagnant and more of a friendship. no hard feelings to him still cheering him on from afar 5 years later. 

i pretty much avoided men and dating for 3 years after that. i started to casually see someone in mid 2023, and i really had a thing for him. but sadly he was not looking for anything super serious and our long term goals did not align so when i met my current partner i broke things off with him because this guy seemed more in alignment with me and my long term goals. 

things were realllllly good reallllly fast. i see now i was definitely “love bombed”. i don’t think that’d always a bad thing but that’s what happened. 

he had shared with me that he had been in a 5 year relationship until march of 2022 and that the girl he was with cheated on him and then just left without saying anything. my heart hurt so bad for him. he seemed so great and i couldn’t hardly believe someone could do that to him. 

well. lolll. it’s now early february. one day he told me i could jsut head to his house and hangout and he’d meet me there once he was off since he worked about an hour later than me and we lived about an hour and a half apart. i get there and there’s a package on his porch, so i pick it up because that seems like a normal thing to do. well. the package is addressed to his ex 🤡 i don’t say anything until he gets there and he seems shocked and thrown off as well. says he will take it to his moms where she can pick it up there. he assures me he is only talking to me and i’m the only person he’s interested in. i brush it off. 

about a week later. one of my closest friends mom (who i counted as a second mom of my own) passed away tragically and very h expectedly. the funeral was quite a ways away so i stayed with my mom the night before who was also going to attend so we could travel together. that night he was so strange. barely texted me. said goodnight at like 8pm. very unlike him. 

a few days later we hangout. he goes to do something outside and it’s jsut felt so off and weird and even his space feels like different as in a bad energy is existing there. he left his phone on the coffee table where i was sitting and i see he receives a text from his ex. i am so ashamed but yes i picked up his phone and i looked. and i see they’ve been texting the entire time we’ve known eachother. he was begging her to come over the night i spent with my mom before the funeral. i get up and i leave. i do not say a single word. i leave. 

he finally realizes this and begins to call me non stop. i answer and he’s like hey what’s going on? and i say i saw you’ve been texting her xyz. he swears repeatedly he has not been. INSANE. i said i saw it so can you please stop lying. silence. he convinces me he’s trying to be nice to her so she will come get the rest of her stuff in his garage. i’m so stupid i believe it and go back. ugh. 

for about a month things are good again. just going through the motion. then again i have to leave town to attend a concert with my friends and he goes fucking weirdo again. he is into biking so i downloaded an app called strava that’s used to track rides. and i see they’ve been riding bikes together while i am away. i also see that they did not stop dating in march instead it was late october, a month and a half before we met. i would have never entertained it if id known it was such a fresh break up. i say enough is enough. i’m done. we go our separate ways. 

a month later he reaches out to me. full of apologies. saying he never got closure from her bc she just left without saying anything and that was hard for him (i have confirmed this to be true. this is indeed how she left and she did cheat on him). i am strong for maybe a week and then i give in. we hangout. things are going so well again. my lease ends in another month or so and we move in together. u. g. h. 

so we move in and it’s fine. we stayed in his area because he refused to go elsewhere. i’m now driving over an hour to and from work a day when my commute was ten minutes. 

i’m happy. i think? this is great, right? 

no. things never get better. this girl refuses to leave us alone and he won’t make her. she has continued to randomly text him throughout the entirety of our relationship.

one example being we went on a bike trip to snowshoe wv, and were having dinner after a wonderful day. he’s showing me pictures from the day. i say hey can i send that to me. he said yes. i hit the message button to send it to me and why is she the most recent contact listed. i say go to your messages. he does. sure enough there’s a text from her there. at this point i’m losing my mind in public. the text is phrased as a reply saying miss you too wish i was there with you blah blah. 

he said he didn’t text her so i keep asking how she knows where we are at and why she would phrase it like that and he can’t answer me. i start to call her from my phone bc at this point girl what are you even doin we both look dumb. she won’t answer. she instead has her mom send me a threat on fb messenger. 

i am states away with nowhere to go. this isn’t an isolated incident. she has ruined every trip we’ve gone on. he also tells me she has texted him recently asking him to buy her a phone and a new bike. 

i was going to leave but he promised things would get better. he finally texted her and her mom and told them to fuck off and i saw the messages. but i feel like it’s just too far gone. this happened may of 24 and it’s now january of 25 and i think about all of this everyday. 

i do have love for this person but im not sure im in love anymore. i’m also not someone who can continue to forgive and forgive because i don’t forget and it’s drastically hurting my quality of life. 

i’ve tried to leave many times and he just breaks down so hard it’s so hard to watch. i honestly know why she left th way she did because it’s so hard to have a conversation to end it where i don’t end up feeling guilty or pressured to stay in fear he may hurt himself or something. he hasn’t said that explicitly but the way he acts it is scary. 

the last time i was about to leave and was convinced to stay he went and adopted two puppies a few days later. i hate him for this. i am so attached to these dogs but i cannot afford anywhere alone where they can be and he knows that. i feel like he did it to trap me. 

he has hit me about three times and said some really awful things to me. i also replay these instances in my mind almost daily. 

i’m in a lot of pain but the biggest pain i feel is thinking about causing him pain. 

what’s wrong with me. please don’t be unkind i know i probably sound incredibly stupid and naive and maybe i am but cruelty won’t help me. i need encouragement that i deserve to live a happy life and sadly that’s not happening right now. i feel so insane for doing this to myself. i honestly think im happiest alone.

This is my first post here- and hopefully a decent one- also English isn't my first language, so please keep that in mind while reading-

I didn't know which flair to use. I put long post because this is a long rant, but since it's a rant I don't know if I should put the custom flair instead. I don't know, I'm confused- I'm sorry-😭🙏🏻

Also feel free to share something in the comments. You can use this post to rant as well if you want!

I decided to join this sub hoping to find a place where, for example, I could find answers to questions that could pop up in my mind, maybe where I could ask for others' opinions and help on something I'm writing and all things like that.

I write for fun in my free time, so I'm not an aspiring author or anything like that- which is one of the reasons why I want to write fanfiction with my favourite characters instead of making my own characters and plot.

I've written some things in the past, but they were really short and just not that great in general. Last year I started a wip for the first chapter of a fic I'd like to eventually publish on Ao3, but I was (and still am) incredibly busy with school and I couldn't seem to find the time for it. And when I eventually had a moment for it, so much time had passed that it was pretty evident that I hadn't written in a long time. And now I find myself in that same exact spot. I'm extremely 'rusty' when it comes to writing and I can't seem to find a way to 'make it better', for the lack of a better term (which is sad because I really like how I started that fic- the first few paragraphs of that chapter, considering how I usually write, are insanely good, but I now struggle to match that quality.)

So I decided to take a break from that fic and I thought I could instead try to write something shorter, maybe a one shot, just to get the gears back into motion. I have a lot of ideas for both one shots and longer fics alike, but the problem is that I struggle to put my thoughts into words. But at this point you might be thinking ""use one of those ideas and write a one shot, this way you get some practice and then work on your main fic, it's not that deep"" but for me it is that deep.

One of the reasons why I joined this sub is because I'm interested in sharing my work on Ao3. Whenever I read a fic I always feel grateful towards the author. They put time and effort into something beautiful and decide to publish it for everyone to see, so that me and others can read and appreciate it. And for whatever reason my smooth brain decided that it wanted to do the same. If I write something I want to share it hoping that someone might read it and appreciate it, not because I want them to praise me and my writing skills, but so they can find something they enjoy reading and maybe I could make their day a little bit better whenever I post an update or something.

Another thing that's pushing me to write and publish on Ao3 is that I can't seem to find the 'right kind of fic' I want to read (for my fandom). Not for the way it's written, like the format or grammar, but because of the plot I'm looking for and the way certain characters are interpreted. I've found similar works to what I would absolutely love to read, but they don't hit as much as I would like them to. I found a fic once that was almost perfect- it was so close to perfection that I was super willing to ignore some details (they weren't the end of the world, but it'd have been a little bit better without them). Turns out that fic was discontinued and I was incredibly sad to find out.

What I'm looking for is kind of niche, but not quite. You see similar things but, at the same time, they aren't the same thing. For example, my favourite ship can be considered a rare pair. There are some fics about it but they're mainly smut- and, as much as I don't mind reading it, they have basically no plot, they're very repetitive and some authors write it mainly because one of the two characters doesn't exactly look human (so it's mainly because they have certain kinks). What I would really like to find with this ship is fluff, I just want them to have a wholesome moment together. And yes, there's some fluff stuff out there, but they're mainly one shots and most of them are common AUs that I personally don't like that much (ex: coffee shop au, collage au, etc) so there's not much canon- I'm not asking for pure canon, obviously, but I'd like a setting a little closer to it- also, canonically they're best friends so the ship can make complete sense in a more canonical setting- AND SOME SCENES IN CANON ARE SO ROMANTIC IT'S INSANE- the reason why it's a rare pair is because, as I said earlier, one of them doesn't exactly look human and a lot of fans don't like them for that.

Another example could be that in this fandom it's really rare to find my two favourite and comfort characters of all time (not the same one I ship together) interacting with each other in a wholesome way. It's possible to find that, but it's in kind of strange ways usually. Canonically they've known each other for years, they even live together (for professional reasons- and they aren't related). One of the two characters isn't as popular as the other, so that is already one reason for people to not really include them, only mention them or make them appear in a scene for a short time in their fics. When you do find them being close it's still a little strange, mainly because of how the not-so-popular one is interpreted (there's not a lot of information on that character and they don't get much screen time so it's understandable). When it isn't strange the not-so-popular one basically acts like a parental figure to the other one, which is absolutely amazing and I love it, but I only found one or two fics in which this is the case, plus the not-so-popular one appeared for maybe a chapter- two if they were lucky- because their relationship wasn't the focus of the fic.

The discontinued fic I mentioned earlier was about one of these two characters. It was mainly about the more popular one, but the not-so-popular one appeared a lot and was actually really important for the plot. They acted like a parental figure and these two were basically perfect for my 'dream fic', but then it was discontinued- that fic literally had me bawling my eyes out because of an extremely wholesome scene with these two-

I'm absolutely dying to see my favourite ship in a longer fic in which smut isn't the main reason why it's being written (bonus points if it's not there at all, I would love a good plot without smut) and I'm dying even more to see those two other characters being close, the not-so-popular one being an older sibling to the other one and just not acting super strange to the point you just want to stop reading the fic altogether. So this is the main reason why I want to write my own fics and share them on Ao3. So that I can make a story about my favourite characters that I can't find online for both myself and other people that may be looking for something like this as well.

So now I'm stuck wanting to write something shorter so I can practice a little bit, but I also want it to be good enough to post on Ao3. And I know that I said I write for fun and I don't have to post every single thing I write- and I also know that anyone of any 'writing level' can write and post on Ao3, but I have a strange feeling whenever I write. And eventually I figured that I just don't like the way I write- not *what* I write, but *how* I write. I always feel like it's not good enough and I shouldn't publish anything if that's the way I write, because if someone were to read it they wouldn't like it or they would find what I'm saying difficult to understand.

But I know that how I write isn't an issue whatsoever, yet I still feel like it is. I have a friend irl that basically decided to be my beta reader, mainly because they also like fanfiction and we have some fandoms in common. Whenever I write something (that I'm comfortable sharing) I like to share it with them and they always tell me how I did a good job and how they can't wait to read more. Sometimes I talk with them about my ideas and they always tell me how I have great ideas. And usually I think my ideas are kinda cringe or embarrassing (I share them with my friend because we really don't care about being cringe with each other-).

Thanks to them I know that how I write and the ideas I have aren't that bad, I know that someone out there on the internet might enjoy reading them, but I still feel like I shouldn't be doing this.

*So now I want to try and change that mindset. I want to write and actually have fun. I want to make writing as fun as it was when I first started writing. I want to write whatever I want without feeling like it's cringe or embarrassing. I want to write something, share it on Ao3 and make someone's day.*

And to do that I'll start by writing a silly one shot. I haven't planned how long it's going to be, I have no idea how it will eventually continue after the main event, I have no idea how it will come out in the end. I'll just write freely, have fun and don't stress about it. And if I do this I'm sure it'll come out good.

The silly little idea I had is basically my favourite characters just playing hide and seek (with a twist that suits the 'canon universe'). Basically everyone wants to play the game, they're able to convince the one who's most likely to not play and that guy ends up being the most invested in the game! In my notes I literally wrote (+ not revealing the characters I'm writing about):

[Title idea for one shot] - in which his friends, especially ____, convince ______ to play hide and seek and he absolutely *LOCKS IN*

I don't know, I think it's kinda funny, especially when I got back to my notes after months and my humour is broken LMAO-

Al‑Anon continues serving up surprises, showing me how much can grow out of seemingly little moments.  
  
I was not expecting anything like the events that have transformed my life over the past 30 years. My wife had decided to do something about her drinking–an issue we had been discussing for months–and discovered an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting near our home.  
​  
“Will you drive me?” she asked.  “I don’t think I can do it myself.” To prove the point, she held her shaking hands in front of her. She found sobriety that evening and I took the first hesitant steps toward a spiritual and emotional makeover of my own.  
  
But I wasn’t expecting anything of the sort as I followed her directions to something called the Gulf Coast Club in Southwest Houston. I remember a crowded parking lot, sitting in the car, and studying her hands clasped tightly on her lap. I thought she was a portrait of combined commitment and uncertainty, in equal doses.  
  
“This is it?” I asked. I knew what her answer would be, but wanted to hear it from her lips.  
  
“I’m not going back now. This is it. Time to turn the corner,” she said, and got out of the car.  
  
Inside, a man behind the coffee bar nodded in our direction, taking us for what we were—two people looking for the answers to questions too difficult to put into words.  
​  
My wife was directed to an A.A. meeting: “Over there through that door. It’s a women’s meeting.” He walked her over and came back, turning his attention to me. “I suppose you want to go to an Al‑Anon meeting.”  
  
I looked at him, waiting for some kind of explanation about why he thought that might be, but his attitude suggested my only possible answer would be “yes.” I suppose I nodded.  
  
Al‑Anon—I was unfamiliar with the word before that moment.  
  
He guided me along a hallway, until we came to a closed door. He opened and announced to the dozen or so mostly older women, “You have yourselves a newcomer.” I was in my 30s at the time.  
  
I sat down and didn’t say anything. The details of a discussion I no longer remember whirled around me. I carefully avoided eye contact, not wanting to give anyone a reason to ask me anything.  
  
Posters with the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions were on another wall, as was the reminder to “Keep Coming Back.” And there I was, glancing around, studying the faces, thinking to myself: *There is nothing in this place for me*.  
  
What could I possibly have in common with these women? They might as well have been speaking Greek for all the sense it made. My package of dark moods felt out of place. There was one other man. Like me, he held back, giving the impression of a spectator, rather than a participant.  
  
*My wife’s the one with the problem* is what I was thinking. Getting her to an A.A. meeting had been my good deed for the evening. Mission accomplished.  
  
The meeting ended as many Al‑Anon meetings do, with everyone standing, holding hands, and reciting the Lord’s Prayer. I was urged to “Keep Coming Back” and get myself a copy of *One Day at a Time* (B-6).  
  
I nodded politely, smiled, said, “Yes,” and then got out of there as quickly as I could.  
  
A week later, my wife asked, “Would you drive me again?” “Yeah, okay,” I said, thinking that this would be it for me. I went to another Al‑Anon meeting.  
  
Weeks later: “You want to come with me?” she asked, sounding like she didn’t really care one way or the other. I said “okay” without really thinking about it, but I realized later that I might have been feeling the first stirrings of a response to what I had been hearing at the meetings.  
  
I thought I might as well try to understand the other side of this program to which my wife had so readily given herself. Besides, this stuff about feelings, well…it was interesting, kind of… hearing people discuss feelings that had been part of me all my life, feelings I had never felt comfortable discussing.  
  
That’s how it began, one meeting leading to another. My connections with the thoughts floating out of the conversations came slowly, but they took shape as I began to tune in: discussions about insights that made a difference, little moments big enough to hang a life on. Moments that made people laugh, get angry, cry, or even rejoice. Like looking into a mirror and recognizing important stuff for the first time—little moments and big differences.  
  
I would one day tell friends, as my sense of clarity developed, “God was talking to me and I began listening.”  
  
I was beginning to feel less like a victim and a little bit more like someone who might just find the strength to push back against the forces that had shoved me in all the wrong directions for much of my life.  
  
That’s Al‑Anon—my favorite one stop shopping place for life-altering insights.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects millions of women worldwide, impacting their hormonal balance, metabolism, and overall health. One of the most common ways to manage PCOS is through nutrition. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, certain dietary choices can help alleviate symptoms, balance hormones, and improve overall well-being. As a woman with PCOS, your diet plays a crucial role in managing the condition and improving your quality of life.

Here are some **nutritional health tips** specifically tailored for women with PCOS to help you feel your best:

# 1. Focus on a Low Glycemic Index (GI) Diet

One of the key challenges for women with PCOS is insulin resistance. This occurs when the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to higher levels of insulin in the bloodstream. A diet high in refined sugars and carbohydrates can worsen insulin resistance, so it’s important to focus on foods that help stabilize blood sugar levels.

**Tip:**  
Choose foods with a **low glycemic index** (GI), which are digested slowly and cause a slower, more gradual rise in blood sugar. Foods like whole grains (brown rice, quinoa), legumes (lentils, chickpeas), and non-starchy vegetables (leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower) are excellent choices for maintaining blood sugar balance.

**Foods to Include:**

* Whole grains like oats, quinoa, and barley
* High-fiber vegetables like leafy greens, cauliflower, and spinach
* Legumes, such as lentils, chickpeas, and beans

# 2. Incorporate Healthy Fats into Your Diet

For women with PCOS, inflammation is often elevated, and managing inflammation is key to improving symptoms. Healthy fats, especially omega-3 fatty acids, can help reduce inflammation and support hormonal balance.

**Tip:**  
Incorporate foods rich in **omega-3 fatty acids** and **monounsaturated fats**, which help reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and support overall reproductive health.

**Foods to Include:**

* Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines)
* Chia seeds, flaxseeds, and walnuts
* Olive oil, avocado, and nut butters

# 3. Prioritize Protein-Rich Foods

Women with PCOS often experience fluctuating blood sugar levels, which can lead to hunger and cravings. Including protein-rich foods in every meal can help stabilize blood sugar and keep you feeling fuller for longer.

**Tip:**  
Choose lean sources of protein that also provide essential nutrients. **High-quality protein** helps to regulate blood sugar levels, maintain muscle mass, and balance hormones.

**Foods to Include:**

* Chicken, turkey, and lean beef
* Eggs and Greek yogurt
* Plant-based proteins like tofu, tempeh, and edamame

# 4. Add More Fiber to Your Diet

Fiber plays a crucial role in managing PCOS by helping to regulate blood sugar levels, improve digestion, and support weight management. Many women with PCOS struggle with weight gain, and fiber can help manage your appetite and improve gut health.

**Tip:**  
Aim for at least **25–30 grams of fiber** daily, with a focus on high-fiber fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Fiber-rich foods also promote healthy bowel movements, which can help with bloating and digestive discomfort.

**Foods to Include:**

* Berries, apples, and pears
* Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts
* Whole grains like oats, quinoa, and brown rice

# 5. Consider Supplementing with Inositol

Inositol is a nutrient found in foods like fruits, beans, and grains that has shown promising results in supporting women with PCOS. Studies have indicated that **inositol supplementation** can help improve insulin sensitivity, regulate menstrual cycles, and reduce symptoms of PCOS.

**Tip:**  
Inositol is commonly available as a supplement (often as **myo-inositol** and **d-chiro inositol**). If you're struggling with PCOS symptoms, it may be beneficial to talk to your healthcare provider about adding inositol to your routine.

# 6. Stay Hydrated and Limit Caffeine

Dehydration can exacerbate symptoms of PCOS, such as bloating, fatigue, and skin issues. **Water** is essential for flushing out toxins, improving digestion, and supporting metabolic function. On the other hand, excessive caffeine intake can increase cortisol (stress hormone) levels, which can worsen symptoms like acne, anxiety, and irregular periods.

**Tip:**  
Aim for at least 8 cups (64 ounces) of water daily and limit caffeinated drinks like coffee and energy drinks to no more than one or two cups per day.

# 7. Avoid Processed and Sugary Foods

While the occasional indulgence is fine, processed and sugary foods should be kept to a minimum in a PCOS-friendly diet. These foods can trigger blood sugar spikes, worsen insulin resistance, and increase inflammation. They can also contribute to weight gain, which can make managing PCOS symptoms even more difficult.

**Tip:**  
Limit **refined sugars**, processed snacks, sugary drinks, and fast foods. Instead, opt for whole, unprocessed foods that nourish your body and support hormonal health.

# 8. Include Antioxidant-Rich Foods

Antioxidants play an important role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are commonly elevated in women with PCOS. Incorporating foods rich in **vitamins A, C, and E** can help protect the body from damage and support overall health.

**Tip:**  
Opt for a colorful diet, filled with a variety of **fruits and vegetables**. These provide a wide range of antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress and support hormonal balance.

**Foods to Include:**

* Berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries)
* Citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits)
* Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
* Nuts and seeds (almonds, sunflower seeds)

# Conclusion: Your Journey to Better Health

Managing PCOS through diet is a holistic approach that can significantly improve your symptoms and help you feel more in control of your body. By focusing on **low glycemic foods**, **healthy fats**, **protein**, **fiber**, and **hydration**, you can better balance your hormones and reduce inflammation.

Remember, every woman’s experience with PCOS is unique. It’s important to listen to your body and work with your healthcare provider to find the right diet and lifestyle changes for you. By taking small, consistent steps towards better nutrition and health, you can manage your PCOS more effectively and improve your quality of life.

1hv35rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1hv35rk/ranting_about_how_sleeping_has_been_a_weird_issue/,Ranting about how sleeping has been a weird issue for me for years. I can still fall sound asleep after taking my (prescribed) adderall and drinking coffee. ,"In highschool, i could never wake up for school.
I used to wake up (way past my alarm) and find that i would be wearing either half an outfit - (like jeans and still a pijama shirt) OR i would be fully dressed in my outfit for the school day with no recollection of ever getting changed. Some mornings i would be able to tell that my teeth had even been brushed with no recollection of doing so. 
A few times, i would have to search my room for my phone in the morning. Because I guess when my alarm was going off, i would shut my phone down and put it away somewhere in my room (like my sock drawer). 
Through out senior year, 3 seperate times, i texted people while i was fully sleeping and when i saw them in the morning, it would be funny crazy jumbled messages. 

Finally i got a sleep study done senior year. I was devastated to find that the results were overall normal, and my doctor “diagnosed” me with “delayed sleep phase syndrome” which to me sounded like a silly not even real issue. Apparently something off about my mental clock 


Off to college and i didn’t set myself up for any early morning classes. Though, senior year of college i had to take an 8am, and missed or was very late to several of those classes and it became a problem again.

Now, done with school, off to work. I’ve been much better than i was in highschool. But still. 
Some mornings, (while still half asleep) I get up to my alarm, take my (prescribed dose of) adderall, and quickly drink a cup of coffee… and then i STILL fall back asleep. Sound asleep. 
That can’t be normal!!!

My sister has also been having weird sleep things too over the last 2 years. She can sleep for over 24 hours with out waking up at all. On Friday, she’ll take a nap after work at 5pm, and i won’t see her again until Saturday night.

My aunt has had this thing her whole life where if she laughs too hard she passes out asleep. 

Anyway. Thanks for taking the time to read my rant if u did. Wierd right?  ",10,1736181337.0,Narcolepsy,0,0.92,False

1hv34jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1hv34jk/dementia_vs_mental_health_issue/,Dementia vs Mental Health issue?,"Hi all, 

Let me first state that I’m posting here out of desperation. My family is having significant issues helping my Dad with his ongoing mental/physical health issues. Keep in mind, he is 68 years old. I will try to keep this as concise and short as possible:

Since my Dad retired two years ago, our life has been complete chaos. Early on in retirement, we thought he was just having a hard time adjusting to the lifestyle. He has always worked long hours, and worked his entire life. He has never been able to sleep in retirement. Early on, we thought he was manic. He’d sleep 2-3 hours, wake up and drink a pot of coffee. Would fall asleep at family activities, at the zoo, etc. Also would sleep while his grand kids were playing and nobody else was there.   

Before retirement, he was a napper but never to this point. He worked long hours and traveled to and from KC <-> StL every weekend. 

His symptoms as we see them now:
- Sleeping very little. 3-4 hours at most
- Terrible social skills. Texts a bunch of people he’s not close with. He was always personable but soft spoken prior to retirement 
- Irritable. He’s had screaming episodes with both my sister and Mom. My mom took him on a friends trip and he was so rude she sent him home. When he got home, he got drunk and screamed at my sister. My mom and him do not speak now really but they live together. My sister is also living with them. 
- Cares a lot about how he looks. Wears watches. Dresses up now and where’s boots often. He was a hoodie and tennis shoe guy before. Also openly said he liked a woman at church and she “makes his day”
- obsessed with Music and guitar. He’s always played guitar, and was in a band when we were younger. Now it’s seemingly all he cares about over his children, wife, and grandkids
- unable to work/fix amps and guitars. He also is not trusted to work on our cars anymore. (He was an engineer at Ford prior to retirement, and we worked on cars together often)


Last night, was the last straw for worrying. My sister said she asked him something, and he said he couldn’t hear her. (He’s always had slightly bad hearing from guitar). He went downstairs to get hearing aides and pulled up a chair directly in front of her. She was on the couch. She said she didn’t want to talk at 11:30pm about the topic, and he went downstairs to play guitar. She asked him to stop playing and he told her to shut up. Then, about 20 mins later left the house without telling Mom/Sister where he was going. There was a snowstorm in St. Louis happening at the time. 


Worried, they called and called. Eventually he let them know he walked to his church, which is about 15 minute walk. 

I guess question for this Reddit: 
What are best steps in finding out if this is dementia or more mental health?

We tried to get him into good neurologist for scan, and no availability until July. Mom eventually found one in February, but that’s still far away. Is the ER a possible solution to bypass this wait? 

Any help is appreciated please - He has not been diagnosed with anything

Edit:
If I review FTD Dementia symptoms and/or Depression or Bipolar etc. He basically checks off boxes between them all. He ears a lot of sugars and carbs. Drinks a lot of coffee to stay away. No longer has interest in family. Bad judgement. Lost weight. Mood swings. It goes on and on ",2,1736181253.0,dementia,1,1.0,False

Equipment:
Bambino Plus
Baratza encore grinder
Fellow kettle
Scale with timer
Tamp and portafilter that came with machine 

1. Turn on machine and run a double shot of just water through it

2. Empty and dry portafilter, should be noted I still have the plastic part in my portafilter it came with. I use the larger basket it came with. 

3. Grind out the beans, I don’t single dose. I keep a day or two worth of beans in the hopper and have gotten exceptionally good at eyeballing how much I need so I’m not wasting much at all. 

4. I use the 12 setting on my baratza, it’s not course but could be finer? This is the setting I got to work best and I just stuck with it. 

5. With my portafilter on the scale, I spoon 16.5-17.5 g of grounds into it. I don’t have a dosing funnel so I use a spoon for less mess. I just find that 18 is too much and between 16.5-17.5 is great. I know that’s a big margin. If you don’t use a dosing funnel how are you getting the grounds into the portafilter?

6. I tamp in my tamping mat. I want a new tamp, I use the lightweight one the machine came with. 

7. I put the portafilter in the machine and pull a double shot. I’ve programmed it to pull between 50-60 mL of espresso in about 25-30 seconds.

8. Here’s what I might get roasted: I don’t weight it out or pull it manually. I can’t fit my scale under the head and so every few days, I weight my coffee cup before pulling the shot and then after to make sure I’m still in that 55mL~. And if I am, I don’t adjust. If I’m way off, I reprogram the shot. 

9. It should be noted I don’t use the single shot function because I don’t get out of bed for anything less than 2 shots of espresso. 

10. And then I steam milk/heat water depending on what I’m making. The two popular drinks in our house are americanos and cortados. 

What stands out? What needs to be fixed? It’s honestly making a good shot. Just wondering if I’m missing something important or if there is definitely a tool I need. I feel lost on why I would need a different portafilter but I’m open to conversations. ",1,1736181164.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

throw away account but here's some background: 

this is my first relationship in a while and I truly don't know where to draw the line. I don't have anyone in my life who has been in a long-term successful relationship to get advice from so that’s why I’m here. I used to give advice all the time to my friends when I was single and they were in relationships but as I am getting older, I recognized that’s not what I need. I need someone who has been in a long-term relationship to lend some advice, it’s easy to say “leave him” when you’re single but I know that relationships take work and compromise. 

Let me start by saying that he is a very sweet, considerate, and kind guy. The most considerate and thoughtful guy I’ve ever been with and this is also only my 2nd relationship. he opens my door, he likes to plan dates, he’s a gentleman, and when I had a bad week he bought me flowers and a Starbucks gift card. Stuff like that, we’ve been dating for about 3 months now and I also want to put out there that I have been lax and lenient with some things because when we met, *he lost his grandmother* and she was the one who raised him. I’ve lost people too and I know how hard it is to lose a loved one but I can't imagine losing my mom so I’ve extended a lot of empathy.

**Here’s how we are different**: I am a healthy person! I love to work out, and prioritizing a healthy lifestyle is huge for me. I really want my children to be in an environment where a healthy lifestyle is normal. I didn’t grow up with this and my family is riddled with health problems ultimately, my grandma died from a heart attack due to her immobility and obesity. He doesn’t work out and has said he would change in the past but he has already fallen off multiple times and hasn't stuck to it. He eats out a LOT, doesn’t exercise, and is at 7/11 daily getting candy, gas station food, and sugar-filled coffees. In the morning, it is a common occurrence that he will eat candy first thing until we get breakfast. This has happened many times, and it grates me so much! I’m not against sweets but he eats sweets and candy multiple times a day. He is overweight which actually doesn't bother me as much as his habits 

We go to his place on weekends, which I’m grateful for. So, after his grandmother passed, he inherited the house. I have said multiple times: *I know this is a lot to take on. Let me know if you need help with anything,* etc., but he just started to deep clean the place after I mentioned it to him. He’s lived with pets his entire life, and the house didn't smell great, with dust and cat hair *everywhere*, and the fridge was filthy and full. I don't think he was regularly sweeping and mopping or wiping down the counters, which is problematic when your cat gets up there. I'm not against pets, but I think to have them requires a higher level of cleaning and cleanliness which I brought to his attention. Now I'm scared that this deep clean is just a phase (like the healthy living thing), and he will go back to the way things were. And I don't want to come into this being a maid especially because I don't partially enjoy pets. I don't mind them but the hair everywhere and smells are just not my favorite thing, especially if it will fall on me to keep things clean in the future.

I'm not sure if it's a self-esteem problem or a self-love problem but for example, his boss treats him badly 7/8 times, and he’s like, “Yeah I’ll invite him to our wedding if we get married” I just think this is a huge issue! he treats you terribly the majority of the time…. why would you invite him when he's made it very clear how he feels about you? He said, ""Well the first year after I met him, he was a good male figure for me blase blah..."" So I'm like out of the 8 years you've known him, that 1 year overrides the 7 years of bad..? He has a history of toxic gf's and they've done some crazy stuff but it's almost like he's too self-sacrificial. any issue I bring up he's immediately on board to change or ""do better"". Like he would remove parts of himself to be with me which is an issue. He's also said something like ""If things don't work out between us, I won't date again""

Now there's the hygiene thing: I'm not sure how much he's brushing his teeth. Which is gross to me and I don't want to kiss him. and at the same time, I don't feel like I should have to tell a grown man to brush his teeth. I went to his place at 3 pm on Saturday and left about 2 pm on Sunday and I don't think he brushed his teeth. On top of the fact that it's just *gross* but because of how much sugar he eats, it adds a layer of gross-ness because I know he can feel that fuzzy feeling on his teeth.

I know we won't agree on everything and that compromise will happen but I’m unsure if this is too much of an incompatibility issue or if I should give him more time/space given he's likely still grieving on top of having an entire house to manage. Despite all of this, I've never had someone as sweet and considerate as him, but I'm also wondering if he's just doing that to keep me around and to avoid working on himself and distract me from the fact that he's not following through *(he has said a few times he wants to do better, but doesn't stick to it, etc*) I also don’t want to get in any deeper if we both need to find someone else more compatible. I am not perfect by any means but I believe in watching what people do versus what they say. 

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks",1,1736180949.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False
1hv300p,https://www.reddit.com/r/StraightTransGirls/comments/1hv300p/current_january_2025_mood/,current january 2025 mood.,"6 months later, and i'm still feeling the feelings of heartbreak, a little bit of demonic insanity in the mix too with the hope that he might come back, but what is heartbreak without being delusional, right? my days are spent drinking tons of coffee, while studying for my exams, writing my university essays, texting the current guys i'm texting, and then the unstoppable tears while i listen to taylor swift and reminisce. currently also watching the vampire diaries for the first time, and i need my stefan and elena moment now omg. they're so cute. the last time i saw a friend was ice skating with her and her boyfriend, but i was totally third wheeling while they romanced in front of me. i don't feel jealous or envious, because i know right now is the season of patience for me. i know good things will come.

still though, i feel possessed by histrionic emotion missing him. the last few months i processed my feelings by getting into hookups, new flings and dating new guys, i played the field but now i just wanted to be loved in a real way. he isn't my soulmate or the love of my life, because the man i love would never treat me like this. but i think it's okay to miss something real, a connection. he was the first guy i ever liked who liked me back after all.

these taylor swift songs are particularly relatable to me right now.

 [Haunted - Taylor Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cC6fw8EqWU)

""I know, I know, I just know, You're not gone, You can't be gone"" are literally such a simple lyrics but the emotional grief in me has such a strong reaction to them.

[If This Was a Movie - Taylor Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wZEx9A8p9k)

The fact that this song mentions 6 months since the relationship yep... it's like she's singing about me. 

my hook up party girl era made me forget what a lovergirl i am at heart omg. anyway, this is not my usual kind of post but instead of doomposting about my sad emotions i just wanna talk about the reality of heartbreak like a journal entry lol. anyone else coping with the feels rn? what are you listening to or watching to help?

Ako? Hindi naman ako gwapo, at wala pa akong confidence. I try to act na parang wala akong pakialam or hindi ako interested, pero lagi pa rin siyang nagcha-chat. Minsan, naghi-hint pa talaga siya na gusto niya ako.

Ang pinaka-challenging ay lagi niya akong ini-invite sa mga events or activities na halatang gusto niya ako:

-Lagi niya akong chine-chat kahit random lang, para lang magtuloy yung usapan.

-Lagi niya akong ini-invite kumain o lumabas kahit walang malinaw na dahilan.

-Bumibili siya ng snacks o coffee at binibigay sa akin bigla.

Ayoko naman siyang paasahin kasi hindi pa talaga ako ready at wala pa akong maibibigay emotionally or financially.

1hv2t8j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hv2t8j,Setting post op boundaries with Roommate ,"Hey y’all. So i have a straight, cis, autistic roommate and Im trying to set clear boundaries for my post op recovery time.

This is inspired by the fact that I told him I would be doing a huge batch cook meal prep the other night and him deciding to have 5 friends over at the same time to drink in the living room 

Not only was it super obtrusive to be dating around so many big dudes while trying to cook, as well as losing the coffee table as a cooling surface, but it also stressed me TF out germ wise. I have a pretty ass immune system and have been literally only leaving the house for the gym and grocery shopping for the last week. And of course been masking religiously (y’all ever try to do russian twists in a mask? not a good time.)

At first i was very annoyed with him for this, but then i realized i was operating under the assumption that he could read my social cues (saying no to going out and citing my need to stay healthy, asking everyone who’s come over if they’ve been feeling sick at all) and getting annoyed when he didn’t. Which is obviously not fair. I am in charge of setting clear and firm boundaries, I am the only one who is obligated to prioritize my health, and when i don’t do that it’s not other people’s fault when they act in ways I don’t like. 

So, because he’s got a terrible memory i decided to write it out for him before i leave for surgery tonight. He hasn’t responded which is stressing me out so i was so swing if anyone has the time to read what i sent and let me know if im being reasonable.

*for some context, we share a large friend group, and our apartment is central to most of our outings, and therefore is often the pre and post game spot. Also my roommate is incredibly social and has friends over at least 3 times a week. 

**also also i do regret not addressing this with him sooner but it wasn’t until the ‘throwing a small party when he knew id be using the kitchen and living room’ thing that i realized it needed to be clearly stated ",46,1736180463.0,TopSurgery,10,0.99,False

I (22M) had a dream last night involving my friend Joe (23M), and it stirred up a lot of old feelings I thought I had moved past. For some context, Joe and I have been friends for five years. We first met as coworkers at a coffee shop when I was a teenager.

Joe is more masculine-presenting, whereas I lean slightly more feminine, at least in my interests. Honestly, if it weren’t for his incredible personality, I probably wouldn’t be attracted to him at all. But Joe has an amazing personality—he’s charismatic, funny, kind, and one of the best listeners I know. He’s the kind of friend you can rely on for anything, and that makes him truly special.

The problem is that I love him, and I want to be with him, but he doesn’t feel the same way. He just wants to stay friends, and it crushes me. I know he’s not interested in me romantically or otherwise, but watching him hook up with other guys makes me feel an overwhelming sense of jealousy and envy. It’s a feeling I’ve never dealt with before, and I don’t know how to handle it.

These feelings have caused me to use hookups as a coping mechanism for the pain, which has been a pretty big issue for the past nine months. I’ve confessed my love and adoration to him twice, and both times, he gently made it clear that he doesn’t feel the same way. It hurts deeply, and the thought of confessing again fills me with so much shame and fear of rejection that I can’t imagine going through it a third time.

To make matters worse, Joe is part of a larger friend group that I value immensely. If Joe were just a random friend, I could go no contact and work on moving on. In fact, I’ve done this before—I went no contact with him for months—but he’s such a big part of our shared social circle that cutting him off entirely isn’t sustainable. I can’t abandon all of my friends again just because I can’t handle my feelings.

We all game together every night, which makes this situation even more complicated. Being around him constantly—virtually or in person—reopens the wounds I’m trying so hard to heal. On top of that, the thought of him finding a boyfriend or being happy with someone else makes me feel physically sick.

The dream I had last night really threw me off. In the dream, Joe hooked up with someone I was also interested in, which made me wake up feeling sad, envious, and jealous. It’s frustrating because I’ve been actively trying to move on, and I even have a date scheduled for tonight. But this dream brought all of those buried feelings right back to the surface, and now I’m stuck feeling terrible.

I genuinely love Joe and would date him in a heartbeat if I had the chance, but I know it’s not going to happen. I don’t want to keep embarrassing myself by confessing my feelings, and I value him too much as a friend to cut him off again.

How can I navigate these feelings? How do I move forward and stop feeling so crushed and jealous? I don’t want to let these feelings consume me or ruin my other relationships, but I’m at a loss for what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I have a massive crush on my best friend that resurfaced after a dream about him. He doesn’t reciprocate my feelings, and I’ve confessed before to no avail. Cutting him off isn’t an option because we share a friend group and game together every night. How can I manage these feelings and move forward",1,1736180125.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

I'm going to start this off as this dream took place a few days ago and I'm now 20, I completely forgot to write it down, but I did tell my mom and fiance about it.

  
I don't entirely remember the beginning but in my mind, it didn't matter because I didn't remember it to begin with. What I do remember though is this took place in my now home. Almost like a copy paste including the cars in the front of the house, even the homes across the street. I had memories of my neighbors, and I knew who they were and what they looked like. It was almost like it was real life with how detailed everyone and everything was, right down to the percentile dice i have laying on the floor right next to me as I type. My brother was sitting in my dad's new car looking at his phone. In this dream there was something like full life insurance. Where if you do something by accident that results in major body trauma or even death by your own cause, you'd be back to normal as if nothing ever happened seconds later. My brother had this. He did demonstrate that by placing a bullet in his head. and then in just a second the bullet popped out and my brother was back to normal, just as he was. Same memories and everything. Just not bullet. My mom found this fascinating and went outside to check to avoid the blood spill in the house...However she didn't have this deal and when she put a 12 gauge in her mouth, all i heard from my room was the shot and then 2 thuds. The sound of her body hitting the ground followed by the crack of her head hit the ground (I'm fully aware a 12 gauge that close would take your head clean off the stump.)

  
I remember running out of my room and looking at the gaping hole at the top of my mom's now lifeless body. Then i woke up. Now I love my mother to death, I do so that's why I find it strange I just had to dream that. But that's not where it ends. When I wake up its 6:30 on the dot. I have to wake up at 7:40 to get ready for work so I used the bathroom, and I went back to bed. 

  
After I fall back to sleep, I am brought to the same dream...however my mom is happily sitting on the couch sipping her coffee in her new Snoopy mug I randomly got her (In real Life) She waves at me and says something along the lines of ""She's awake!"" on my off days I sleep until 10:30 or so. So that wasn't out of the normal.  I use the bathroom in the dream (irl bed is fine dw) and I exit to talk to my mom. Asking her how she's okay and she looks at me confused. That is until I hear her voice coming from outside saying we locked the door on her by accident. This whole time im looking at my mom inside the house from across the living room before I glance to the door. (In my real life we have a towel in front of our blinds on our door because my dad, brother and I are very sensitive to light as it can cause us really bad headaches and migraines. At least my dad and I get migraines. So, in the dream there is also a towel over our blinds on our door) So I go towards the door and pull the towel aside very slightly to see my mom's rotten head shot zombie corpse on the other side from the other dream I JUST HAD. The dead bolt pops open and I panic to get it back. I'm holding the door back as I am deathly terrified of Zombies and have stated many time in real life that if one ever happened as a mass pandemic where the world becomes over run by zombies, I would not live more than a week and be taken by my own hand rather than a zombie.



I get weird dreams so often. Just a night or 2 ago I had a dream a train wrecked through my room and it just sort of...went around aimlessly through our home and out of our yard-?  I love to think dreams are our subconscious trying to tell us something but they're a little dyslexic. Does the dream I had a few days ago mean anything or am I just a weird dreamer-?",1,1736180092.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False
