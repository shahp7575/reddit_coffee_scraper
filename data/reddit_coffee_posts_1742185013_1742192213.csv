I was definitely caught off guard , idk how to react. I thought some just having fun with me but after like 2 min  that person was like nevermind I m sorry and all
That same day 
That person was like I m gonna be no more on reddit and shared Phone number , I was like definitely it's a joke , I saved the person but I texted after a day , hi 
 At this point we like weren't taking that much but like few messages checking on eachother nothing else
Then I was asked can we call , I said yes 
We talked like for 30 min after that
I  got a one time view of how that person look 
I didn't send my pic in response ( got caught off guard)
But it was good talking we laughed and all those things 
And exams r going of both of us so i m really busy 
And so today morning I sent my pic I was like what more it can harm  , that person viewed I think and I haven't got any reply 
I also sent a pic of the book that person recommended me to read ( it was good novel)
I kind of feel disappointed 
I don't talk to people now a days ( trusting people has been hard from last few months)

I guess if i don't get a reply it's okay I was no one soo that should be fine I think
But thoda I feel disappointed as i thought i could or might found a good friend nothing else , but I guess I was wrong I don't like to think of someone as a bad person may be I m too soft or too stupid 
But never really had been the one to push away people 
It hasn't been a good thing for me till now 
But I guess idk confused 

All the best buddy 😃

I've been applying to nearly every opening I see but slowed down recently with midterms and all. My resume has been reviewed both online and by school advisors (I use the WSO format) so I don't think that's the issue.

I've been networking a bit, admittedly I could do a lot more, but I have difficulty converting those first coffee chats into opportunities -- how does one go about doing that? My technicals are decent (I'm not really looking for IB/high finance stuff, mostly just finance/accounting roles at Oil and Gas companies since that's a huge industry in Calgary/Alberta) and I actively pursue learning outside of the classroom, mostly through certifications like the FMVA. 

I'm feeling lost and unmotivated at this point. Nearly all the feedback I get from rejections states that I lack finance experience, but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to have that without my first internship. I wasted the first 2 years of my degree not networking and barely even applying, which is totally my fault, but I want to make sure I don't waste this last year.

1jd5x4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/complainaboutanything/comments/1jd5x4n/im_losing_my_best_friend/,im losing my best friend,"I've posted this before but I have a long update and I want to complain more. 

ORIGINGAL: I've held this in for awhile, so this might be a long and confusing post. My friend and I have known eachother since the second grade and we're practically siblings. We'd been through breakups and different friendship groups but no matter what we always had each other.

However, once we started college we decided to go to different universities. My friend moved in with her boyfriend she'd had since highschool. Well, he began to go through a lot of changes once they moved in. He was getting angry, began to recklessly spend money, and even dropped out of school. My friend sacrificed a lot of herself to get him back on his feet and he put her down everytime she helped. On the surface he would seem like such a nice guy, but in private he would constantly say terrible things to her and just over all put her down.

We had tried to talk to him, suggest therapy, and even I tried to personally speak with him but it just wasn't working. Eventually he landed an okay job, but still he put a lot of the financial/emotional stress on her while she was still in college leaving her to balance both of their lives.

I tried to tell her multiple times that this guy was destroying her life. She constantly had to pick up the pieces after every fight, and it was taking such a toll on her that she was getting physically ill. He would do reckless things like buy extravagant gifts that he would hold over her head, or do something to make her feel terrible even though he was the one who did the bad action.

He didn't just do terrible things to her, he also constantly hurt his own friends feelings or would pick fights with them just to argue. He constantly did this with me to the point where I didn't even want to visit my best friend anymore. A lot of his friends cut him off because of this behavior.

As a last ditch effort to maintain civility, I tried to talk to him more and bring him stuff that I knew he liked, but I gave up on that after he started to pick fights with my best friend because she and I were going to hang out and he said that it was making him uncomfortable with how often we hung out. We see each other every few days depending on work and school, but we're also like family so I don't see how hanging out that often is weird. 

Her other friends were constantly worried for her, and they also dislike this guy. Her friend and I even held an intervention to talk with her, and she admitted they were bad for each other. She's even told us that she doesn't see a future with him, and she doesn't know why she stays.

I've tried everything to help her out of the situation, even offering to get us an apartment and pay the first few months of rent so that she can focus on herself. But no matter what is said she always runs to him, and will later gush about a funny thing he did or a nice date they went on.

Recently, her boyfriend contacted me. We used to be close friends but I had cut him off completely over the last year. He asked if I would tell him why I disliked him so much so that he could learn to grow. I decided to visit them both (after being invited of course) and laid out all the reason why I disliked him, and all the shitty things he's done to not just me but to my friend as well. He was quiet and he listened, but I could tell he was upset. At the end of it all I told him I saw no future with him in it as my friend, and I that we were probably better off not communicating for anything.

I had hoped this would open my friends eyes, to see him confronted with everything. But she didn't, even when he told her afterwards that he was upset I didn't let him explain why he did some of the things he did. (some of the things were done out of pure pettiness and he admitted that to me so I didn't feel like I needed an explanation lol) it feels like she's constantly defending him now. Mentioning every little nice thing he does, even though I told her I don't want to hear about him anymore.

It would be different if she were telling me about the ways he was changing, but from what she's told me, he's still doing the same manipulative and mean things he's always done. Except now he tacks on that he 'wants to change,' after doing the bad things.

It hurts to see someone I love so much sacrifice their life for someone who constantly hurts them. I don't want to cut them off but I've been watching them struggle for years now, and I just can't take anymore.

UPDATE: So after some talking and some therapy, I realized (and was blatantly told by my therapist) that the relationship I hold with my best friend is the same relationship they hold with their boyfriend. Constantly my best friend tells me these terrible things he’s done or these continued behaviors, gets upset that I tell them that that’s not right, and then I feel bad and attempt to comfort them. Much like how they call out their partner and then feel bad and comfort him. They chase after their partner and enable those behaviors, much like I chase after my close friend and enable them the same way.

I told my friend about this and what me and my therapist talked about and they didn’t say much. I did establish the fact I never wanted to see their boyfriend again, and that I didn’t want to be in the same room as him. I told her that he’s done a lot of mean things towards me that have really hurt my feelings and there are things he’s said about me and to me that just can’t be forgiven. I don’t care if she stays with him but I don’t want to see him. And I thought at the time this was fine, but im now starting to realize that theres not really a way to be friends if I can’t support her relationship.

Since Ive made this decision, everytime me and my friend hang out he picks fights with her when she gets home or accuses her of being unfaithful. He finds different ways to attack her for hanging out with me even when we do something as little as getting coffee. She tells me how frustrated this makes her and she tells me that he thinks I’m a bad influence on her. This has also started to make me upset because I don't understand why she lets him talk about me like that?

Soon, there will be an event that my bestfriend and I must attend, but i was not aware that their partner was also invited last minute. This event is being hosted by a mutual friend who said ‘I also don’t like their partner but what can you do?’ I told them I felt hurt because they know what he’s done to me and theyve also been extremely hurt by him before. I also was upset because this is the one boundary I established, and they all seemed surprised when I said I would no longer attend the event.

my best friend was shocked and texted me to say, ‘i didnt realized you hated him that much.’ And it made me so upset. My friend then told me that they feel like they are backed into a corner. She told me they want to make their relationship work, and while she’s not unhappy, she’s frustrated with it because she wishes he would change. She said she wants us to remain close friends and she doesn’t want to lose me. she also said she feels terrible that she’s with a guy who’s hurt me and others so much, but she doesn’t want to leave him. She asked for us to meet up so we can talk, but I just don’t see how this can work. I feel like I’ve been mourning our relationship for so long and I just dont Think there’s any coming back from this, especially after she expressed her surprise that I didn’t like her boyfriend.

I can't tell if I'm just overreacting about everything or if I'm the fool and should've called everything off months ago when these behaviors continued. There's so many specific things that he's done that I can't fully include for need of anonymity and just because there's so many that I don't know where to start. The idea of being without my best friend is devastating, but I feel like I've been choosing her for years, and it might be time to start choosing myself.",1,1742191164.0,complainaboutanything,0,1.0,False

1jd5ujk,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1jd5ujk/if_nc_doesnt_work_might_as_well_try_contact/,"If NC doesn’t work, might as well try contact.","Hello Limmies. Long time no see. 

I’ve come here with a testimony/update with everything. So here goes nothing 

Over the winter break, I tried going no contact with the guy from class cause I am very limerent with him. And let’s just say that didn’t work. I was miserable. And depressed. And it ended up causing more issues in my life. And I was just not good. Let’s leave it at that. 

Let’s just say. When school started in January I decided to hit him up and try to keep things going. Now. Note: this guy knew I was trying to leave him. But that Apparnelty didn’t affect anything between us. When I asked to grab coffee everything felt as normal as it was before hand. And I have felt much better with him in my life. Life is just easier. 

Now you’re thinking: well this doesn’t always work. And so I’m here to say. Sure it won’t work for everyone but it did work for me. And I did it through placing hardcore rules on myself I refuse to break. 

1. I do not speak about my feelings 

2. I do not become vulnerable 

3. I seldom mention dating 

4. I always assume we’re friends unless told otherwise (even if his actions show signs of romance I shut off those thoughts immediately) 

5. I have friends I can talk to and lean on when in need. 

6. I limit my texting. No double texting one right after another. If I text him once. I don’t text him again for a few hours at least. 

7. Find patterns. Finding out he doesn’t text much has a been huge game changer these past few months. I knew a long time ago he wasn’t a big texted but now being able to apply it without being emotional is really helpful. On top of that I kinda figured out his schedule and once asked when good times are to call if I chose to do so and it just ultimately helps feel less rejection and more understanding when I don’t get a response. 

I know I’m lucky cause my LO is very kind and sweet. But overall I just wanted to let you all know: it is not a bad idea to stay in contact. In fact. It might help. Just finding routine and being focused on other things as well really helps. Also knowing your place really helps. I’m at a point on this LO phase where I’m absolutely terrified he’ll fall for me cause that’ll change our dynamic and I’m just so used to this that I’ll think he’s lying or joking if he says he has feelings. 

But anyway. This is my testimony. Nc isn’t always the solution. But before deciding between the two, test each other out. I did NC for abt a month and realized it wasn’t for me. And ever since January, life has been relatively easier in the dopamine addiction area. It’s really weird tho. He seems to have change this semester as well. Like he’s making more time for me. He seems to want to hang out. So. Idk where this all came from. But it’s helped a lot. 

I hope this helps. I’m sorry if I come across rude or boastful. I’m just trying to say: NC isn’t always the solution. In fact being in contact might help more. 

Have a great day Limmies.

So just to start off I (17f) had a very traumatic experience with an adult man (who was very close with my family) when I was 15. I wasn’t mentally able to tell my family about what happened until I was 16 due to being manipulated and lied to by the man. They found out in late May-mid June of last year and so it’s been around 10 months and my parents still haven’t “gotten around” to getting me counseling. 

They are so lazy they do not do anything I don’t have a car cause it’s apparently too much work to go look for one (money is not the issue) and there are multiple things in my room like a broken door and a broken shower that have both not been fixed for years because they say that they can’t have someone come in to fix it unless my room is clean. They are acting like my room hasn’t been clean for 7 years!! 😭😭😭 

Anywho I am FINALLY getting to go to counseling in two days but my mom is trying to sit in on my first meeting so that she can see what they’re telling me and I don’t want her to. My mom is my real main issue in my life right now she is so overly controlling with everything I have to text her every single update of where I am and where I’m going while she has my location, she will get mad if she thinks my texts have attitude and scream at me/take everything away, and literally if I don’t do every little minuscule thing she wants perfectly then she will try to take my sports, boyfriend, church, and phone away from me. 

When I say everything I mean EVERYTHING. I almost got grounded the other day for trying to bring in my homework to a coffee shop she was going into because me doing homework would take away from us spending time together and so I didn’t take in my homework and it was miserable the entire time since she had already yelled at me. 

I need advice on how to get her to not go in the meeting. She is completely unreasonable and somehow always makes arguments out of insane points to the point that I don’t even know how to respond so PLEASE give me what I can say to her and how to respond to any crazy thing she could say.

This is how far I went, and there is a possibility to switch just back to a regular (and lightweight) theme. It was super fun to do it, find interesting names, but at the end, I really love the automations. Anyway, this was supposed to be the main control, super condensed. I have it on a EchoShow 21 (which I somewhat regret, due to the Amazon's limitations on opening the browser automatically (there is a solution-ish) and keep the page opened (there is also a solution-ish).

The theme is heavy, as I said, and used to clog during loading on the EchoShow, but I switched the canvas system to another version HA offers, and it started to load entirely.

I also made special mobile deshboards for all our smartphones, so we only have access to what we most need on our hands. Like, where is everyone (except me!), door open/close, family agenda, etc.

I added a lot of sensors everywhere, and replaced some light switches. Had to understand Zigbee (never played with that before) and it is indeed super cool. I failed to add sensors to my Mailbox, since it is 1 inch out of the radio limit, and also it is a metal box. I saw a project for this, but sounded a lot of work.

HA runs on a RPi5 as a docker container, and I had to code for alert me whenever there is a new version, and I coded a script that makes the upgrade.

I played with some other modules, like HACS (of course!) and installed Mosquitto, VSCode, etc. The one I am starting to play with is Frigate, and I added a TPU to process camera images. But didn't have the time to get back to it.",2,1742189823.0,homeassistant,0,0.75,False

I was diagnosed with endometriosis few years back when I went to see a gynae for painful periods. I didn't do anything about it bc I didn't know what to do.

Anyway this year, I accidentally found out that if I stop drinking coffee for a month, my painful periods disappear 100%. No pains, no numbness, nothing.

This week I chanced upon this Tibetan health teller, I take whatever he say with a grain of salt. But he read my palms and told me I can't conceive bc of ovary issue - I think he was referring to endometriosis. How he could tell just by reading my palms I'll never know. I have been drinking coffee even though I know it causes period cramps for me.

It got me thinking a lot. I was wondering if the diagnosis is just to scare people? And that answer is very easy, no pills nothing, just analysing your diet and see what works and what doesn't? I know people who drink coffee everyday but don't get cramps, but it does affect me so I decide to stop drinking coffee.

I'm grateful I found out about this when my lips was getting very dry everytime after I drink coffee and decide to stop for awhile.

I find eating clementines everyday also helps, but stopping coffee works the best. Coffee once a week works too, but I think it still gets me addicted. Today will mark the start of me without coffee. I will stop drinking coffee completely.

Having opened it, I see that it's the common problem of snapped tabs on the plastic ring, and I thought I might as well upgrade to the M2 burr assembly for a fresh (and cheap) start. But all Encore / M2 components seem to be sold out everywhere online except scam sites, and even the plastic rings are no longer $5 but more like $20+.

For context, we’ve been like brothers since high school. He was the best man at my wedding, we’ve traveled together, been through breakups, job losses—you name it. I trusted him more than anyone outside my family. But turns out, all that trust was misplaced.

A few months ago, I let him borrow a significant amount of money. He told me he was in a rough patch and needed help covering rent and some unexpected medical bills. I didn’t even hesitate—I transferred the money the same day, no questions asked. I told him he could pay me back when he was stable again. He was beyond grateful, even got emotional about how much it meant to him.

Fast forward to last week, I run into his girlfriend (now ex-girlfriend) at a coffee shop. We chat a bit, and she casually mentions, “It sucks how he wasted all that money.” I ask her what she means. She looks surprised and says, “Wait… you don’t know?”

Long story short, my “best friend” had lied about everything. There were no overdue bills. No medical emergencies. Instead, he used my money to go on a week-long vacation with some mutual friends—a trip I had to decline because I couldn’t afford it at the time. He partied, drank, and lived it up with my money, all while telling me he was struggling.

I was furious. I left the coffee shop, called him immediately, and confronted him. At first, he tried to deny it. When I told him who I had spoken to, he just went silent. Then he started giving excuses—“I was going through a lot,” “I didn’t think you’d find out,” “I was going to pay you back”—but I didn’t care. The money wasn’t even the biggest issue. The betrayal was.

I told him our friendship was over, and I expect my money back immediately. He tried to guilt-trip me, saying, “You’re really ending 20 years of friendship over this?” As if he wasn’t the one who threw it away first.

I haven’t spoken to him since. He hasn’t sent a dime. My therapist told me cutting him off was the right choice, and I agree—but damn, it still hurts. Losing a best friend isn’t just about anger. It’s about realizing the person you trusted the most was never who you thought they were.

I guess time will heal this, but right now? I just feel betrayed.",1,1742188830.0,stories,1,1.0,False
1jd5crp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jd5crp,AITA For dating my now ex friend’s ex husband,"First I want to say that this is my first ever story ever posted on here. Also, hello CharLOT I love you! I watch/listen to you daily and my boyfriend has started to as well. Here’s a little back story. 

About 3 years ago in the summer of 2022, I moved to a new town. I started a job at a coffee shop and became quick friends with my manager; Let’s call her Kim. We started hanging out, outside of work, along with a couple other co-workers. The first time we hung out after work she and I, along with another friend, went to a wine tasting. That is where I met her husband, we will call him Jake and his parents. Kim and Jake were high school sweethearts, having only ever really been with each other, and had 2 girls together. They married young and had been happily married for years. 

Eventually Kim started to complain about Jake. “He fell asleep watching the girls this morning”, “He’s so lazy”, “All he does is sleep”, “I always have to check cameras or call him to make sure he’s awake”, and my favorite one “He doesn’t help me clean or do anything around the house”. Jake works in a factory, 3pm-11pm Mon-Fri and sometimes Saturdays. He handles machines over 400 degrees and has to physically put all of his body into his work. He’s had other taxing jobs too like construction and road work, he’s been the main “bread winner”. When Kim would constantly talk down about Jake, I could never understand her. Jake is a sweetheart, selfless, loyal to his core and so gentle. 

He did just about anything Kim had asked him to do; Waking up at 4/5am every day to watch kids, take care of the dogs, do the dishes, pay the bills, go shopping, and pay for her things as well. Kim did the bare minimum at work. She’d sit at her desk and be on her phone and laptop, doing personal things. She’d also sit in her car for hours, or go “shopping” for the store and be gone. She often times would even come in for only an hour of work and leave, always saying “As long as I show up for a little bit” because she was on a set salary. Anytime there was an issue or question, she’d get upset and annoyed. She expected perfection and things done her way. Kim is a very big control freak and has been like that apparently forever. 

Regardless of her attitude towards him, the way she treated him, the way she talked to him; He stayed and loved her with all of his heart. Kim wasn’t so bad at first; or so I thought. She included a lot of people in outside things for work. She wanted to be friends with everyone. She’s artistic, funny, and sweet. Kim truly isn’t the worst person in the world. We became best friends within a year and a half. By summer 2023, she changed and so had their relationship. Funny thing is, things started to change when we got a new co-worker (he’ll be Nate); A tall, muscular man that worked out often and loved being outside and all sorts of stuff. Jake was the opposite. He was always exhausted, working when she was off, always in bed late and up early, sometimes no sleep at all. He didn’t work out or go anywhere. He had no time or energy. 

So over that summer, Kim and Nate had gotten closer. As a group of friends, we’d go to the lake, and on weekends Jake would join. Jake and Nate became friends, got along well and had quite a bit in common. Eventually it got to the point where Kim AND Nate would go to the lake on a daily basis (keep in mind she had 2 toddlers at home while Jake worked). Often times staying the night together. She claims nothing ever happened but I always felt skeptical. Eventually Kim confided in me that she wasn’t happy with Jake anymore because he didn’t put in “effort” and “let himself go” (he was a little chubby). She said she was starting to like Nate, which I had already assumed, along with everyone at work. She said she was enjoying his company and that he gave her peace and she felt like herself more. Okay, I can understand that except Jake was doing all he could to keep up and she didn’t thank him once. She then goes on to tell me how she plans to talk to him and give him 2 weeks to clean up and put in effort otherwise they were separating. This was the moment I knew she was NOT the person I thought she was. 

She got feelings for another man while married and WAITED to decide she didn’t want him anymore. But then gave him 2 weeks so she could decide between the two depending on what he does for her? He wasn’t happy and you could tell. He was exhausted, put no effort into his looks, and gave up on having friends. She got to go out to the bars and spend time with friends and be kid free whenever she wanted. Those 2 weeks were her way of pretending that she wasn’t leaving him for another man. That’s how I see it anyway. After the separation, even though the house was in Jake’s name and his alone, he moved out and into his parents’. He continued to help pay bills and did what she’d ask still because he needed his kids. 

Few months go by and the owners of the coffee shop want to sell it and open a new one in a town over an hour away. They offer her the manager position there; She can name it and create her own logo. Everything was hers to run. She thought about it for a while and told them that the only way she’d be able to move is if all of her debt and majority of her bills were paid for. So they gave her the money to do so. Little did they know, she had to pay off credit cards, a lot of them, that’s she had in JAKE’S NAME! Her vehicle stayed on Jake’s credit and she still kept it but didn’t pay any of it. He still has a credit card he has to pay off because of her mind you. On top of a car that is currently ruined because she never took it into the shop for the regular checks. 

By December, she was packing, dealing with her affairs, and went through the house to get everything she wanted from it. Guess what she did? If you guessed that she left the house trashed, YOU GET A COOKIE!! She had it DESTROYED. Jake and his parents had to go over to deep clean the kitchen, living room, and dinning room. She also left their dogs there and gave Jake no help when it came to them dispute them being her dogs. Jake couldn’t stand living in that house, he had just gotten his heart broken and was going through divorce and trying to figure out co-parenting. So he stayed with his parents and when he had the girls, they stayed too. It’s not ideal, but he confided in me as a friend (before we got together) that he couldn’t handle all the memories just yet. 

During all of this, I stayed friends with both Jake and Kim. I love Kim still and I have loved their girls since the start. HOWEVER, I was not seen as family. The girls didn’t call me auntie, I wasn’t her sister, we were just close friends. That is until she moved. I didn’t hear from her often, when she’d come to town she’d tell me she plans to see me but never actually contact me while she’s in town. I then started hearing things that she had said about me behind my back and things turned more sour. We had next to no contact. Jake however became closer friends. He and I had NO thought in our minds to be anything more as I had thrown the thought of him being even a little cute out of mind instantly. That was after all, my friend’s husband. Jake and I would go out with friends to the bars, I’d be there for their kids’ bday parties and I get along with the family. They all love me and have made it very clear. I am also the ONLY friend that ever showed up to their birthdays, Kim even told me that herself. 

Fast forward to September 2024. Jake and I are great friends. We have confided in each other and been vulnerable with each other. We’ve given advice, made inside jokes, all of it. He then started coming over to my place often, we always had other friends over. We’d watch movies or listen to music and talk along with special gardening involved 👀. I started to realize I was getting feelings for him, he was absolutely adorable because he was shy at first and didn’t get comfortable or close to me for weeks. He’d even get flustered while we gardened which I thought was the most hilarious thing. One day after his daughter’s bday party, I texted him telling him he looked good. He didn’t know how to respond so he just said “thanks” and I had thought that my shot was turned down. Despite his actions and the way he talked to me, I thought I had to move on from those feelings. 

Except I was wrong and he made that very clear at the beginning of October. About a week in, Jake and I had a movie night alone at my place. He needed a friend and so did I. So we started movie nights. Each night Jake would scoot closer and closer and finally the 5th movie night, we lean into each other and start cuddling. From then on, we had many movie nights with talking and cuddling and eat snacks. We laughed and felt so comfortable and at peace together in the chaos of our separate lives. My family had no plans for Thanksgiving, so I was invited (before dating Jake) to their family Thanksgiving. By November, we wanted to be more. Before making it official, I told Jake that I wanted to talk to Kim about him and I before she found out another way. She was a friend and I felt she deserved to hear it from me. Jake however, did not feel the same way, arguing that she was barely a friend anymore because she stopped talking to me and that it doesn’t matter if I tell her myself or she finds out. I was irritated and thought on it for a while and decided I WOULD talk to her. But I didn’t want it to be over the phone or text, that’s not how I deal with serious talks and she knows this. 

On the 8th of November I get a text. Kim had found out from Jake’s parents that I’d be at Thanksgiving. I never got confirmation if she assumed it or who told her that he and I were seeing each other seriously. But she was NOT happy. Now, I’m sure I said some things unreasonable and probably escalated things as we fought that evening. I however thought it right to defend myself and Jake, who has always had a hard time putting his foot down with anyone (Screenshots included of course 😘). After that, Jake and I decided to make it official on the 11th of November (11/11 imagine that 🥰).

Okay, this is where things get ridiculous in my book. The girls knew about Jake and I and I had asked them myself when they had brought it up. His oldest asked if we were dating as I had been around every weekend, he said yes and I looked at them and asked them, “is that okay with you guys?” And the smiles they had on their faces warmed my heart. I knew that as long as his girls and family liked me, I was set. I wanted Kim and I to be on good terms of course, I do not hate her, even now despite the things she has done and said. His girls are 6 and 4 and VERY smart and quite independent for toddlers. Jake’s parents have adored me since we met, his mother had a nickname for me from the start and his father and I share the same dirty mind 🤣 along with his Nana and his aunt and her kids. I have never walked into their home and felt unwelcome. 

Jake and I would take the girls to the movies or out to eat with us, our date nights were with them. I’d take pictures and videos and post them on my Snapchat. I had 3 of Kim’s other friends on my Snapchat because I thought they were also my friends. I would get screenshot notifications from my story. Of course it doesn’t show who, but I knew it was one of the three as she’d text or call instantly and chew Jake out. I removed all of them, it didn’t take a genius to figure out who would be the ones doing it. So after the first blow up, Kim set “rules”. I was no longer allowed in HIS PARENTS’ HOUSE when the girls were here. I was not allowed to see them. Period. We all thought it was absurd to set that rule. She had claimed it’s because “it’ll confuse the girls. You were an aunt to them and now you’re dating their dad” and we explained that they are perfectly okay with it. His parents and I had talked about how it made no sense and how she had no right to tell them who they could have there or not. On top of all of this, she starts asking for money. Kim has a 2 income household and rents a house; she shouldn’t be struggling as she has a great full time job and runs her own coffee shop. The issue is, she has a spending issue, hence all of the credit card debt. She wanted money for gas, for clothes for the girls, she needed a bill paid, etc. MY biggest issue with this: Jake was paying mortgage on his house which was raised to over $900. Then electricity which isn’t much to be fair but then again, the electricity barely works. Only 3 lights work in the house. He also has his mustang to pay for on top of insurance and he has to make sure his girls have clothes as they grow fast and Kim is of no help at all when it comes to taking care of the girls while they’re here. So she expects Jake to give money to HER? It’s insanity and I can’t express how disappointed I am in this woman. Jake only gets so much a paycheck and has plenty more bills than I can tell you guys. Let’s just say he spends over $3,000 a month. And it’s only him. 

1 week goes by and the next weekend Jake tells me that the girls keep asking where I am and when I’d be over. It breaks our hearts and his parents even wanted me over. The next weekend on a Saturday, Jake and I are texting and talking about how ridiculous this “rule” was. I had finally convinced him that she had no right to say I couldn’t go over there. It’s not her house or his and his parents didn’t care what she said. He sends me a video of the girls and they say hi to me and ask when I’m coming over. Jake and I instantly gave in and I jumped up and literally RAN to my car. After finding out the next day, Kim was livid. She was even more pissed when she found out that I’d be joining Jake when he dropped off the kids. Wanna guess what happened next? If you guessed that she set another rule, YOU GET A BROWNIE!! I was absolutely NOT allowed out of the car or to even look at her. Important note: Jake has a mustang. One with VERY small backseats and you have to get out to pull the front seats forward in order to let people in the back, out. So then one of his kids had to crawl over to the other side and struggle to get out because I wasn’t able to get out or I’d have to face the wrath of Kim. 

Then Thanksgiving comes around. Every family has their own way of doing things for the holidays. This was the first holiday I’d be at with his family, so I was unsure of how to help or what to do. I had asked Jake and he said I wasn’t expected to help seeing as his mother, aunts, and oddly enough Kim, had it handled. After Kim and Nate had left, she texted Jake. Now I don’t know the exact text as he told me what she said but she told him that it was rude and I looked bad that I didn’t get up and help. When his parents heard him say it, they all chimed in and let’s just say… I clearly had no idea who Kim truly was! According to Jake’s immediate family, Kim had never gotten up to help with holidays or events before. They were surprised when she started helping with the food and the setup. Even more so when she helped put food away. I could NOT believe it! She always made it seem like she was the one to organize the parties and events and like she would cook everything. Kim was TRYING to make me look bad in front of the family, when in reality, it showed them how childish she still is. Best thing about it, no one listened to her. 

It is now March 2025. Kim has stopped complaining about me and texting me. However! She HAS avoided family gatherings. Christmas was spent with no Kim or Nate. Fun fact: Nate is NOT at all better than Jake. This man smells like he doesn’t shower. He uses NO deodorant and doesn’t seem to wash his hair. Anytime he walked by, it smelt like BO and something just rotten. And god help anyone around when he holds his arms up. And there is no way Kim doesn’t know it as she had complained to Jake about his smell all the time when he’d come home from work. On top of that, Jake and others have commented on the smell and Kim just says “I know”. How the girls stay around him and not die by the fumes wafting off of him is beyond me. 

To this day, I still don’t talk to her. We don’t look at each other much or stick around each other long. Best part about it all? I have been the SWEETEST little honey bee in the hive to her. She dresses the girls up cute and does their hair every time they come home for the weekends. Each time I compliment it and ESPECIALLY when she’s around. Comments like, “Mommy did your hair so pretty!” And “I bet mommy would like that, go show her” and my FAVORITE kick in the stomach is “Behave for mom okay?” I only get out of the car and say goodbye to the girls now. Kim will stay inside, or have Nate come get them, and her favorite and most recent is “I had to run to the store”. We truly believe she’s still holding a grudge. 

I can’t tell you that I understand her anger, because I truly don’t. She loved me for 2 years, her children love me, her brother and I had been friends since before I met her, and Jake’s family also love me. How could she be THIS furious after being divorced and separated for over a year? Her argument is understandable at FIRST glance; You’re my best friend and you should’ve talked to me first. Except my argument is a lot more… detailed. I exposed her and told her EXACTLY what I thought. I wasn’t absolutely nasty, but I definitely made my feelings clear to her. Here’s a deeper dive into Kim and I’s relationship… 

I am a loud, clumsy, hyperactive, anxious, emotional mess. I also speak without thinking, so I often times interrupted people. I had been struggling to keep myself from doing that, but it took a lot of time and I still have the issue from time to time. I also tend to talk in a tone that isn’t the right tone if you know what I mean. Sometimes when I’m overwhelmed or irritated, my tone of voice is rough and snappy. Kim had to pull me aside and yell at me a few times for my “attitude” I had ALWAYS apologized to whoever I snapped at. Explaining how I get into my head too much and my tone is never something to take literally when I’m in that state of mind. Not only that, she’d snap at me outside of work. 

She’d judge me for the things I did, people I talked to. She tried to convince me to completely drop my best friend/sister of 15 years simply because we had a fight. I explained to her that I wouldn’t do that and I wouldn’t allow her to talk shit on her because regardless of our fighting, she’s my family. She’s the ONLY person who has seen every side of me. Good and bad. Kim would also butt in and try to get me together with guys even though I did NOT want to date. I was in a friend’s with benefits relationship with someone and had been since I was 21 years old (I’m 24 now). That ended a year ago and it’s old news. However, Kim constantly brought up that I’d see other people too. Which wasn’t ever an issue. I’d wear something or do my makeup a certain way and she’d pick it apart and tell me what I could’ve done different. At one point, a coworker and friend had moved in with me. We eventually had some differences and my roommate at the time wasn’t upholding our roommate agreement (we signed a paper and printed it and all). She ended up going to Kim and complaining, I had happened to mention it a couple times at work to another friend and suddenly Kim gets in the middle. 

At WORK she pulls us aside to talk things out. At work. She dragged my roommate and I’s personal issues and life into our work space so we could talk it out in front of her. She HAD to know. I don’t mind complaining a little bit at work about life, however I would not stop my working to talk about my personal situation with someone else when I can do it with that person on our own time. She did anything she could to have a say in things. 

I do not hold any grudge against Kim. I know she has good qualities, but she seems to have become more bitter as of late. She continues to make things difficult for Jake. She stopped paying her car payments and the car is getting repossessed, except guess whose credit gets screwed with? Jake’s. She knows this and won’t help him pay off HER car. Now she wants to move to Hawaii with Nate to be with his family. It costs over $4,000 a MONTH to live there. She claims they can do it and she’d pay for the flights back and forth for their girls. She struggles enough as it is to pay for things, enough to where she has to ask for help even with 2 incomes. BUT little does she know, Jake and I had talked about wanting to move as well. We don’t care for it here despite our families being here (I have a rough one with my family). So, if Kim moves out of state, we will be moving as well. Jake hates his job, I have such a bad history in this town that I want nothing to do with the outside world much. Thinking about leaving hits heavy in my heart because my friends would be left behind. My best friend and I of 15 years have NEVER been separated so far before; except for the 3 months I stayed in Texas after graduation. And those 3 months were HELL. 

I have yet to hear anyone really tell me that I’m in the wrong other than Kim herself. I feel she is unreasonable and will continue to be for a long while. However I LITERALLY have dreams of us making up and being friends again. I want that. Especially because I want their girls to be able to have both of their parents around along with their partners and see them getting along. I grew up around childish adults that held grudges. All I ever wished was for my parents to be kind to each other and nice so I could have both of them there on important days. The fighting traumatized me unfortunately and I suffer to this day. I do not wish for a child to watch their parents hate each other and fight. So am I the A-hole for dating my ex friend’s ex husband? ",0,1742188791.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,13,0.33,False

For me, presence looks like:
•	Catching myself before I scroll mindlessly and choosing to sit in silence instead
•	Making coffee and doing nothing else while I drink it
•	Pausing to really listen when someone’s talking, instead of thinking about what I’ll say next
•	Feeling my breath during a stressful moment and letting it guide me back

It’s small. Unimpressive. Sometimes inconsistent. But it matters.

And that’s what I love about this space — we’re not trying to perform presence, we’re just trying to practice it, however it shows up.

So I’m curious:

What does presence look like in your life lately?
It can be honest, imperfect, even strange. No wrong answers here.

I reset my badge three days ago and went cold turkey: no coffee, no tea.

I’ve spent those three days mostly in bed with the classic withdrawal symptoms: throbbing headache, fatigue, nausea, etc.

(Why oh why am I SO sensitive to caffeine?)

I’m through the worst of it, and returning to my old self.

The hardest part is not going to my favorite coffee shops. I miss them so much.

Looking forward to the 9-day mark when the lingering headache will probably go away.

I’m getting my true energy back… jitters are gone. I even went to the gym and squatted with genuine non-caffeinated energy.

I can’t thank the people in this forum enough for their guidance and support.

1jd55iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jd55iw/doctor_is_stumped_copper_deficiency/,"Doctor Is Stumped, copper deficiency","My doctor is ""stumped"" on what is wrong with me, so I thought I'd post here and see if anybody has any insights.

29F (despite my username), in late September 2024 I had covid for a second time (had the initial 2 part vaccine and a booster). Both when I got the vaccine and when I first had covid, it impacted my menstrual cycle, primarily giving me painful cramps when I had never had any before. So after my second instance of covid, I had a delayed period (~3 weeks late), and then cramping after it ended. I didn't think much of it due to the previously mentioned changes. However this pain went on for 2 weeks and became bad enough that I was concerned it was stomach pain and went to the ER for fear of appendicitis. They did urine, blood test, and CT scan and found nothing indicating stomach pain but did find a partial blood clot in my spleen. I'd been on hormonal birth control in the past but not since early 2021.

Prior to the ER, I was diagnosed with ADHD, copper deficiency and essential tremors. Have had the ADHD forever, taking Adderall for it. For the tremors we had done a precautionary MRI brain scan in mid 2024 that turned up nothing. Copper was caught in a CBC that was ordered when we were looking into the essential tremors, we tried a supplement but had no improvement. He said they also checked for Wilson's disease but I don't know when or how. Also worth noting, I was a pescatarian before the ER. After I stuck to the BRAT diet and to this day still eat that, fruits, and roast beef as that's all my stomach can handle without giving me bathroom problems or stomach pain. I also have severe insomnia, which we've tried some medications for (last one was the name-brand one that celebrities take and go party, cant think of the name) but nothing has worked. He gave me another one, Temazepam but i haven't tried it yet since it didn't go with one of my new medications. I have a lot of exhaustion because of this. If I take a 15 minute nap, I probably won't sleep that night. At worst I've gone 3 days with maybe 15-30 minutes of sleep because I can't fall asleep. Once I'm asleep I'm out like a log but I don't usually wake up feeling rested. There was a 6 month period where I wasn't working and I decided to let my body do what it needed, I would sleep 14-16 hours at a time and then be up for 36-72 hours. It's been like this since I was a child. Also, caffeine doesn't have an impact on me. I can drink a coffee or energy drink and still fall asleep 10 minutes later.

Saw my regular doctor the next day who prescribed me blood thinners and a litany of blood tests & referrals. In December, did another CBC and a bunch of blood tests but didn't have any indications other than the copper and increased cetaphils(?) as it turns out I am allergic to Lomotil which he prescribed me for stomach pain. In early January, did a colonoscopy and the throat version of that, and was diagnosed with acid reflux and lactose intolerance. Never noticed the acid reflux before and haven't noticed any change since taking the medicine. Never been lactose intolerant before (could eat ice cream, drink the milk out of the cereal bowl, etc.) but I did feel that after I had covid the second time that dairy was giving me a problem. Doctor said it wasn't related to the covid but idk what else would have changed that. 

Also saw an allergist in January who did blood tests, and now I was showing vitamin D deficiency (since it's winter she prescribed me a 10k supplement but did go back and forth between that and 5k), and low iron. The low iron particularly is weird as I'd started eating meat again. My regular doc had tested for these in December so it was odd to see a big drop just 1.5 months later. I have a lot of allergies but mostly pollen related (grasses were a big winner in this field). None of the tests were related to foods. This was a blood test and not the skin test.

My doctor has twice told me he's stumped and when he brings in students he goes, ""Oh yeah. This is the one I was telling you about, with the copper deficiency"" LOL. I'm mostly functioning fine, I do feel more exhausted than normal but work has also been busier and I'm halfway through moving so it may just be stress related. Any thoughts or input would be appreciated! My googling attempts are also stumped. Since it's been 6 months on blood thinners I'll be getting another CT scan soon, hoping the clot is gone. I think I got everything but let me know if there's questions. Typing this on my phone as well so apologies for any typos.

ETA: Never smoked, never been pregnant, did some heavy college drinking but never severe and may as well be sober at this point. Not overweight, adopted so don't know family history beyond Maternal grandparents died of lung cancer after being heavy smokers. Also, thyroid was tested and came back with no issues. K specifically asked for that as it matched a lot of symptoms but he's checked twice to be sure and both times the blood came back fine and the physical tests he did were fine.",2,1742187974.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1jd54l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jd54l8/aitah_for_demanding_that_my_girlfriend_showers/,AITAH for demanding that my girlfriend showers before she touches my bed?,"I, 18M, have OCD. While unofficially diagnosed (it just isnt in my best interests right now) I have had enough professionals tell me that I have it for me to consider it fact at this point. My OCD presents mostly in thoughts of contamination, namely objects contaminating me. My bed is one of these objects. The moment I view my bed as contaminated, I stop showering, ""If I will get dirty from touching the bed then what is the point,"" type beat. I have been able to combat this thought process by always making sure to shower right when I get home before I even touch my bed. 

Recently my, 18F, girlfriend has been staying over. Usually I just suck it up when she lays in my bed, and wash it the moment she leaves, to avoid any conflict or awkward situations. This system worked well enough at first, but it quickly grew draining for me, especially as she started coming over more frequently and started staying over most weekends. 

This Saturday when she came over to my house, I had just changed my bedding for the week, and wasn't really feeling like going through the hassle of washing it again that soon. I somewhat jokingly asked my girlfriend if she wanted to shower before we settled down to watch our show, but she just laughed and shot me down. I got more pushy after that, basically telling her that she had to shower if she wanted to touch my bed. I also gave her a few other options, telling her that we can go settle down on the couch to watch tv, and even move the coffee table and make a little makeshift bed out of blankets on the floor if she wanted. I thought that these were good compromises, but she didn't seem happy. After some back and forth, she grabbed her things and stormed out without even really saying goodbye.

She knows about my OCD, and she usually steals my clothes when she stays over anyway, so I dont see what the big deal was. She hasn't responded to my texts since then with anything other than short replies like ""k,"" ""yes."" ""no."" ""cute,"" so on and so forth. I'm scared that I might've done something wrong, and want to fix this so that things can go back to normal, but I dont see how I could be the bad guy for wanting her to shower before she touched my bed.

1jd53kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jd53kw/trapped_in_the_machine/,Trapped in the Machine,"Every morning, I wake up feeling like a piece of me has disappeared overnight. The alarm screams, and for a second, I just lie there, staring at the ceiling, trying to convince myself to move. My body feels heavy. My mind feels empty. But I get up anyway, because that’s what I do. That’s what I’ve always done.
The day unfolds the same way it always does. Coffee I don’t really want. Clothes that make me look like someone who has their life together. A train full of tired faces, all heading toward another day of pretending to care.
By the time I sit at my desk, I already feel drained. The emails pile up. The meetings drag on. People throw around words like “optimization” and “strategic alignment,” and I nod along like it means something to me. It doesn’t. It never has.
I don’t know when I started feeling this way. Maybe it was a slow burn, one bad day blending into another until it became my entire life. Or maybe it was always there, this feeling that I don’t belong here, that I don’t belong anywhere.
I hate this job, but I can’t leave. I can’t even imagine leaving. The thought of quitting makes my chest tighten, not because I love this place, but because I don’t know what else I’d do.
What am I even good at? What do I have to offer the world?
I scroll through LinkedIn sometimes, looking at people my age who seem to be thriving. Everyone has a title that sounds more impressive than mine. Everyone has a success story, a big leap they took, a passion they followed. Meanwhile, I’m just… here. Stuck.
People say, “If you hate your job, just quit.” But what they don’t understand is that it’s not that simple. It’s not just about money, though money is part of it. It’s about the fear. The fear of failing, the fear of realizing that maybe this is all I’m capable of. That maybe there is nothing better waiting for me.
So I stay.
I stay in meetings where my voice doesn’t matter. I finish work that I don’t care about. I push through the exhaustion, the loneliness, the nagging feeling that I’m wasting my life.
I tell myself I’ll figure it out. That one day, I’ll have the courage to walk away.
But that day never comes.
Instead, I wake up. I go to work. I come home.
And I do it all over again.

We’ve known each other for little more than a year (mostly as aquaintance, have each others phone numbers, just saying ‘hi’s and short talks). 

Past month, I was sitting next to him and actually had some long conversations. He mentioned the event related to the hobby, so I texted him on when he is playing (it’s a sport btw). He told me the date and also said to let him know if I ever want to do something outside of this hobby, so we met for coffee. For the second time I asked if he wanted to hang out and we got dinner. I was going to put my card down too for dinner but he said I could pay him back later. I emphasized that he should let me know where to pay back, also sent a text the day after dinner to let me know where to pay my part for dinner, but he just thumbs up’d the text and never told me (I just assumed that’s him wanting to pay?) Last week, I asked if he’s doing anything after work on Friday, he was busy due to something related to work, I wished him well, told him to let me know if he wants to do Saturday instead, and nothing since. He’s not a big texter so the only time we text is basically for logistics for meeting which I’m pretty much the similar way.

Being an introvert myself, it is hard to be so direct with him. I’m not sure if he likes me or just thinks of me as a friend (he told me he doesn’t have friends that he hangs out with). I don’t want to do something out of delusion and ruin the friendship by accident. What do we think..? Is he into me? ",0,1742187531.0,introvert,3,0.5,False

1jd4zid,https://www.reddit.com/r/dad/comments/1jd4zid/am_i_the_trouble_here/,Am I the trouble here?,"Let's go back to start of my teenage years. I started picking up little arguments with my parents, nothing major, classic temper tantrums and sometimes, just stating my opinions which my parents took as talking back. Sometimes, I crossed the line which my father sorted with a conversation if the argument was with my mom or with his belt if it was with him.

Things started escalating as years passed. The arguments became more serious and I started being more disrespectful and moody in general to the point I risked ruining my relationship with them forever a few days back.

All throughout these years, my father was very moody around me. When I was in my early teens, he'd scold me when I said hi to him (he thought it was disrespectful to talk to your father that way) and ignore me when I asked how his day was. But sometimes, he'd respond nicely and also initiate conversations. He still behaves this way. I think it's just the pressure from work that makes him behave this way but that doesn't change the fact that I've probably locked myself up and cried plenty of times because he was being rude to me for no reason.

He sometimes takes interest in my conversations and sometimes he doesn't, again depends on his mood. In the last few years, he has become incredibly strict with me, yelling at me for the smallest mistakes I make. However, I feel he's not doing it to hurt me and instead thinks it'll help me improve myself.

His dad was a classic old school stereotypical dad , so, I don't completely blame him for how he thinks a father-child relationship should be. 

He wants me to treat him like he treated his dad. He's extremely extremely extremely respectful towards his dad (the three extremelys are not enough to show how much he loves & respects his dad) but that is not the kind of relationship I wish to foster. 

I've always thought of all humans to be equal but I don't mind a little regard for older folks and respecting them but I don't believe in complete submission to someone and I believe a person's first responsibility should be towards protecting their self respect.

So, if I think I'm being wrongfully scolded, I retaliate. I state what I think and point out the double standards (there are many things that he wants me to do when he doesn't do them himself). I firmly believe a parent should lead by example.
My mother asks me to not retaliate and just let it go but tells me that I'm making the right arguments in private.

Now, my dad isn't the only one in the wrong. Despite everything that happens, he still loves me and is always there for me and I can get really disrespectful sometimes. But he sometimes mistakes me voicing my opinion as talking back and being disrespectful.

The second part, my mother has always pampered me. I'll be an adult next year but she still does everything for me. I have a reason, last few years I've been extremely busy with my studies and we've all fell in this routine where she does everything for me. I don't really want to leave this comfort zone as I'll be leaving for college next year which I why I wish to mend things with my father (I might not ever be back home once I go to college; I'll obviously visit but I mean staying at home like I do now)

My father has always opposed this and says she should let me do stuff on my own. For the record, I know how to do everything my mother does for me, so, I would still be able to function when I move out. However, life will always be busy and I think I should learn how to manage my daily tasks along with studies.

But since, my mom does everything for me, guess what, she does everything for my dad too and when she's not around, he wants me to things for him. Well, not all things but 50% of the things. Making him coffee, getting him water, etc. I am not the happiest person when doing these tasks, not because I'm lazy but because my father will refuse to help me in the simplest ways 80% of the times. There's something right behind his back and I ask him to pass it, he won't. He's walking past a table and I need something, he won't get it for me. He's moody, so, he does what I ask 20% of the time. I still have to do everything he asks me too because what other option do I have but I make sure he knows I'm not happy doing what he's asked.

As I mentioned I don't have responsibilities around the house and I would be ready to accept chores if my dad did too. I hate the idea of seeing my dad sit around not doing anything while mom and I do the chores. He does look after my dog though which counts as a chore, so, I feel I'm again in the wrong.

I've been assigned a chore once and I didn't really stick to it due to my schedule. So, I do think my father not helping me is a way to teach me responsibility but then it's again the hypocrisy that stings. Today as soon as he got off work, he asked mom for dinner. My mom works too and also takes care of the house. So, she had just lied down and told him that it was kept in the kitchen and to get it himself, but he refused and asked her to serve it when she gets up. 

Two major questions here as far as I understand are, first, me thinking I should be treated somewhat equal to my dad in a way that the respect he wishes I give him should be reciprocated. I don't want to be on my best behaviour just to be ignored and not even glanced at when I ask him how his day was. Is thinking I'm almost equal to my dad fine? My simple explanation for this thinking is that we're both human.

Secondly, my mother suffers from excessive workload because my dad doesn't help around a lot and neither do I because, as I said, I don't want us to be managing the house while he sits & scrolls his phone. Should I put my ego aside? I feel my ego is taking precedence over love for my mom.

I'm sure there are plenty of other things you could give for feedback on and as I always state while posting, please be honest.",1,1742187345.0,dad,1,1.0,False

## The Contenders: A Fast Overview

Before we delve into the nitty-gritty, let's quickly recap the key players. The AirPods Pro 2 (especially the USB-C version) have solidified their position as the go-to premium earbuds for Apple users. Known for their seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem, excellent active noise cancellation (ANC), and convenient features, they're a popular choice for everyday use.

On the other side of the ring, we have the Sennheiser Momentum 4. These headphones, whether we're referring to the over-ear version or the potential future true wireless iteration (MTW4), are Sennheiser's answer to Apple's dominance, prioritizing unmatched sound quality and a comfortable listening experience. The Sennheiser Momentum line has always been about delivering a rich, audiophile-grade sound in a portable package. When people search 'sennheiser momentum reddit reviews' they are looking for something that the more mainstream airpods may lack.

## The Soundstage Showdown: AirPods Pro 2 vs. Sennheiser Momentum

Let's get to the heart of the matter: sound quality. For many, this is the deciding factor. Redditors on r/headphones and r/audiophile frequently engage in heated debates about ""sound quality airpods pro 2"" vs.""sound quality sennheiser momentum,"" and the consensus, while subjective, leans slightly in favor of Sennheiser, especially when comparing the over-ear Momentum 4.

the Sennheiser Momentum 4 typically delivers a wider soundstage and a more detailed, nuanced sound signature. this means you'll hear instruments and vocals with greater clarity and separation, creating a more immersive listening experience. The bass is generally more controlled and less boomy compared to the AirPods Pro 2, offering a more balanced audio profile that audiophiles often prefer.Considering searches such as 'audiophile earbuds reddit', those interested in detailed audio will likely find something to love about the sennheisers.

The AirPods Pro 2, while significantly improved over their predecessor, still offer a more consumer-friendly sound signature. The bass is punchier and more prominent, which many find enjoyable for genres like pop, hip-hop, and electronic music. However, some audiophiles may find the sound a bit less refined and detailed compared to the Sennheiser momentum 4. The AirPods Pro 2, however, do excel in providing consistent sound across different devices and streaming services thanks to Apple's audio processing.

Keep in mind, tho, that individual preferences vary. What one person perceives as ""better"" sound quality, another might find less appealing. Ultimately, the best way to determine which headphones sound better to you is to try them both if possible. Some Reddit users even mention that the Momentum 4 sound can be tweaked more than the Airpods pro 2,which may greatly impact the sound.

## Comfort and Design: What Reddit Users Are Saying

Comfort is crucial, especially for extended listening sessions. when we analyze ""comfort airpods pro 2"" vs. ""comfort sennheiser momentum"" discussions on Reddit, a few key themes emerge.

The AirPods Pro 2 are designed for portability and discreet wear. Their lightweight and compact design make them incredibly comfortable for most ears, and Apple provides a variety of ear tip sizes to ensure a secure and snug fit. though, some users with smaller or unusually shaped ears might find them less comfortable over long periods.

The Sennheiser Momentum 4 (over-ear) prioritizes long-term comfort with plush earcups and a padded headband. Many users find them incredibly comfortable for hours of listening,making them ideal for travel or work. However, their larger size makes them less portable than the AirPods Pro 2. In a future true wireless iteration like the MTW4, Sennheiser would likely need to balance sound quality with a comfortable and secure in-ear fit, a challenge that many manufacturers face.Reddit threads frequently enough highlight that the over-ear Momentum 4 can get warm during extended use, especially in warmer climates. This is a common issue with over-ear headphones, but it's something to consider if you live in a hot environment.

Ultimately, comfort is a subjective experience. What feels comfortable to one person might feel uncomfortable to another. Again, trying both headphones on before making a purchase is highly recommended.

## Noise cancellation: Blocking Out the World

Active noise cancellation (ANC) is a major selling point for both the AirPods Pro 2 and the Sennheiser Momentum 4. Both headphones do an excellent job of blocking out ambient noise, but there are subtle differences in their performance.

Generally,the AirPods Pro 2 are considered to have slightly better noise cancellation,particularly in the mid-range frequencies. This makes them ideal for blocking out chatter in coffee shops, office environments, and airplane cabins. The adaptive ANC feature on the AirPods Pro 2 automatically adjusts the noise cancellation based on your environment, providing a seamless and effective experience.

The Sennheiser Momentum 4's noise cancellation is also very effective, especially in the lower frequencies. This makes them great for blocking out the rumble of engines and traffic noise. The Momentum 4 typically allows for more customization of the ANC level, which can be beneficial in certain situations. Again, those on reddit agree that the Airpods Pro 2s are better for being out and about, this may be attributed to superior noise cancelling.

Reddit users often praise both headphones for their ability to create a quiet and immersive listening experience. However, some users have reported that the Sennheiser Momentum 4's noise cancellation can sometimes create a slight pressure sensation in the ears, which can be uncomfortable for some people. It's therefore important to understand ""noise cancelling earbuds reddit"" user experiences to take it into account.

## Battery Life: Keeping the Music Playing

Battery life is another important consideration. When it comes to ""battery life airpods pro 2"" vs. ""battery life sennheiser momentum,"" the over-ear Momentum 4 headphones typically have a notable advantage.

The AirPods Pro 2 offer up to 6 hours of listening time with ANC enabled, and up to 30 hours with the charging case.this is generally sufficient for most users,but it may not be enough for long flights or extended listening sessions.

The Sennheiser Momentum 4 (over-ear) boasts an notable battery life of up to 60 hours, making them ideal for travel or extended use. This is a significant advantage over the AirPods Pro 2.

If we're talking about a potential Momentum true wireless (MTW4), the battery life will likely be closer to that of the AirPods Pro 2, but Sennheiser would undoubtedly strive to offer a competitive battery life in that category.[[Explore Top Rated airpods pro 2 vs sennheiser momentum headphones reddit on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/bose-700/?kw=airpods pro 2 vs sennheiser momentum headphones reddit)
## Features and Ecosystem Integration: Apple vs. the World

This is where the AirPods Pro 2 truly shine,especially for Apple users. The seamless integration with the apple ecosystem is a major selling point.Features like automatic device switching, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and easy access to Siri make the AirPods Pro 2 incredibly convenient to use.

The Sennheiser Momentum 4, while compatible with both iOS and Android devices, doesn't offer the same level of ecosystem integration. Though, they do offer a range of features, including customizable EQ settings, smart pause, and wear detection.

Redditors on r/apple often highlight the convenience and ease of use of the AirPods Pro 2, while those on r/sennheiser appreciate the Momentum 4's more open and customizable platform. Some reddit users also note that the airpods pro 2 are great if you're in the apple ecosystem.

[[explore Top Rated airpods pro 2 vs sennheiser momentum headphones reddit on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/bose-700/?kw=airpods pro 2 vs sennheiser momentum headphones reddit)
## Price and Value: Getting the Most for Your Money

Price is always a factor. When considering ""airpods pro 2 price"" vs.""sennheiser momentum price,"" it's important to compare apples to apples (pun intended). Generally, the AirPods Pro 2 and the Sennheiser Momentum headphones (over-ear) are priced similarly, placing them in the premium headphone category. The true wireless Momentum earbuds are often at a slightly higher price point.

The ""best headphones for [use case] reddit"" threads often weigh price against performance.Some users argue that the AirPods Pro 2 are a better value due to their ecosystem integration and convenient features, while others believe that the Sennheiser Momentum 4 offer better sound quality for the price.

Ultimately,the perceived value depends on your individual needs and priorities. If you're a heavy Apple user who values convenience and seamless integration,the AirPods Pro 2 might be the better choice. If you're an audiophile who prioritizes sound quality above all else, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 might be the better option.[[Explore Top Rated airpods pro 2 vs sennheiser momentum headphones reddit on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/bose-700/?kw=airpods pro 2 vs sennheiser momentum headphones reddit)
## Addressing ""Best Wireless Earbuds Reddit"" and Alternatives:

The search term ""best wireless earbuds reddit"" casts a wide net. It's crucial to understand that the ""best"" earbuds are subjective and depend on individual needs and preferences. while the AirPods Pro 2 and Sennheiser Momentum offerings are strong contenders, they are not the onyl options.

Reddit users frequently discuss alternatives like the Sony WF-1000XM5, Bose quietcomfort Earbuds II, and Technics EAH-AZ80 as strong competitors in the premium wireless earbuds market. these alternatives often offer a different balance of sound quality,noise cancellation,comfort,and features.

It's worth exploring these alternatives before making a final decision to ensure you're getting the best possible fit for your needs and preferences. The searches 'airpods pro 2 alternatives reddit' and 'sennheiser momentum alternatives reddit' may prove useful.

I decided I would just go out and try the Remarkable Paper Pro and return it if it wasn't what I was looking for.  

I am mainly looking to read and edit/comment on technical pdf documents.  Seems nice to be able to get away from sitting at my desk to review (coffee shop, chair, etc).  Currently, I just print out technical papers and get them bound to get away.  This works fine, but I tend to go through highlighters a lot and get stacks of documents on my shelves.  I was hoping to try a different approach.  

After messing around with the Paper Pro, I have the following question and I was curious if anyone had any insights.

* I want to be able to markup/edit the pdfs and then transfer back to my laptop where they are permanently stored for reference.  Can you bookmark pages on the pdf so that the bookmarks carry over when you open it up on your laptop using adobe?  Similarly, do the handwritten notes carry over to the document so you can see them when you open the document on your laptop?  So far, I can tag pages on the paperpro, but they don't seem to carry over.  Also, my notes and highlights are not carrying over when I push it back to my laptop (its just a clean pdf).
* Is there a different device that works better for this specific purpose?  I went with the paper pro mainly because it is backlit and has color.  Also, I got it at Best Buy, so I could return it easy if it wasn't what I was looking for.

1jd4wu5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jd4wu5,Classic for last 10+ years. Is it worth it?,"I have bought gaggia classic when we moved from Europe in 2013. I had that exact same one back at Denmark. After getting one in the US, for 120v I had minor issues. 

3 vibration pumps. Few brew head gaskets. Solenoid valve stuck with something maybe 3-4x. This usually results in low flow. I had that now 2025, removed solenoid, cleaned it, but still seeing black particles in my water. 
Also, my pucks are not very dry. Never have been. Why? I use my machine quite often, maybe 4-6 cups per day, in the last 13 years. 

Now, I had that low flow rate issue and replaced pump or cleaning of solenoid did not help much. Out of desperation, I opened the boiler. It was terrible. There was some black and white stuff, not minerals (calc) because warm citric acid did not made it bubble and dissolve. The stuff was coarse. Like maybe 1mm crystalline powder and platelets. Whole lot, 3 tablespoons?! 

I washed it out, aluminum boiler is heavily pitted and corroded. Upon cleaning and reassembly, everything seems to work fine. But is this the end of line for my machine? 

What should I do? Get new boiler (I have seen aftermarket brass for $170) with new gaskets $20, maybe new solenoid $50, and wait for another issue? What if the electrical switch block fails? I have seen people having problems with that. Part is no longer made and is hard to get. 

I was about to get new jura during covid as an upgrade. Finally gave up on that. Now they cost well over $2k. 

Maybe profitec for $1,200? Or keep classic for until another issue? 

What would you do and why?

1jd4ws6,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1jd4ws6/angles_los_angeles/,"Angles, Los Angeles","Sunset Boulevard has broken subtly in half.

(Draw a line.

The angle's no longer 180°.)

**Early morning on a building site in the Hollywood Hills:**

*...the smell of coffee drifts over power tools, planks and sawdust, as a construction crew works on an actor's new house.*

“Yo, Angulo, gimme another measurement on that, yeah?”

“Eighty-nine degrees,” Angulo says.

“Fuck.”

“It was ninety yesterday.”

(It was.)

“What now, boss?” Angulo asks.

“We do it over,” says the boss, *but what he doesn't know yet is: it's not just this right angle; it's every right angle. There is no do-over.*

**A schoolroom:**

*...already the corners are closing in—as a boy draws the four sides of a square, measures the four resulting angles and finds:*

89° + 89° + 89° + 89° = 356°

= the new rectangle.

= the new reality.

*His teacher checks, but can only confirm the result. She tries with another protractor, another rectangle, another shape… to no sane avail.*

(The protector's dull plastic edge provides one way out, if you run it across the skin enough times—

*There's screaming as the paramedics rush in.*)

So what does it mean—this discontinuity of mathematics—this acutization of angles?

It breaks the mind a little, considering it; because if *this* can change, *what can't?*

Are *h, G, Λ, etc.* expirable?

Is the speed of light

**mortal?**

Are the physical constants inconstant—which age, degrade and disappear?

(“We are gathered here today to lay to rest the electron-fucking-mass.”)

Was a line [until now] always(?) 180° or was it once 181°, because [some say] that we may still resist insanity in a changing universe if we understand the change.

I don't know.

*We lack the data to know*—caught, ignorant—in the cubes and other angular shapes that today we've realized are mere snares of our own, unconscious making.

They are shutting on us like jaws.

Humans developed bear traps in the 17th century. Physically simple, primitively effective. Something steps on the plate and—

As a species, we thus find ourselves having put intellectual weight on a metaphysical plate working on the same basic premise:

Geometry,

whose false immutability deceived us.

It's too late to step back.

The arms of the so-called “straight” line are already closing, one ° at a time. Reality, as we foolishly conceived it, is being crushed.

**Deangularization:**

*the act of exchanging angular for nonangular shapes*

is a chimera. The circle and the sphere will not save us. We cannot huddle safely in rings or survive in orbs while all around us the angles slam shut.

Yes, today the circle may be steady at 360°, *but who knows for how long that will remain true?*

The right angle was truth too.

The line was truth.

**Sunset. The Santa Monica Pier:**

*A man and woman hold hands, staring at the horizon.*

*A hawker sells rocks.*

They've brought their own bag, one for the two of them, chained to both. Together they fill it—

(“I love you.”

“I love you too.”)

1jd4unx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Henrycastel/comments/1jd4unx/book_review_first_break_all_the_rules_by_henry/,Book Review: First Break All the Rules by Henry Castel,"This week, I want to share an incredible book with you. Its title is bold yet insightful: First, Break All the Rules. This book amplifies the voices of one million employees and 80,000 managers—yes, you read that correctly, those numbers are massive! Conducted by the renowned Gallup Agency, the research behind this book is based on extensive interviews that provide deep insights into the nature of talent and reveal the secrets to turning that talent into lasting performance. It’s truly fascinating. Let’s dive in!

 

Let’s cut straight to the chase and talk about the role of a manager within an organization. As a manager, your goal is to create an environment where employees feel empowered to be their authentic selves, enabling them to perform at their best. To achieve this, you need to truly know your team members. Spend time with them, listen to them, take them out for coffee or a meal, and show genuine interest in who they are as individuals. Only then you can identify their strengths and define outcomes that align with those strengths. The best part? This book provides practical tools to help you do exactly that.

 

Through their research, Gallup distilled the essence of effective management and developed a way to measure workplace strengths. This is simplified into 12 key questions, known as the Q12, which measure the core elements needed to attract, engage, and retain top talent:

 

1. I know what is expected of me at work. 

2. I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right. 

3. At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day. 

4. In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work. 

5. My supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about me as a person. 

6. There is someone at work who encourages my development. 

7. At work, my opinions seem to count. 

8. The mission or purpose of my company makes me feel my job is important. 

9. My associates or fellow employees are committed to doing quality work. 

10. I have a best friend at work. 

11. In the last six months, someone at work has talked to me about my progress. 

12. This last year, I have had opportunities at work to learn and grow. 

 

If you can create an environment where employees answer positively to all 12 questions, you’ve built a workplace where people thrive.

 

This book comes highly recommended. As a manager, mastering these questions is essential. Ask them to your team, analyze their responses, and use the insights to improve your leadership. The role of a manager is critical to a company’s success. Without strong managers, a company is destined to struggle. A great manager must excel at four key responsibilities:  Selecting the right people (choose for talent, not just experience, intelligence, or determination), Setting clear expectations (define the right outcomes), Motivating employees (focus on their strengths), and Developing their team (help them find the right fit). 

Your ultimate responsibility is to turn talent and drive into performance.

My husband has ruined both our lives by asking me to double up his lunch serving for work.

I’m on a throw away because I still haven’t fully decided on divorce but I’m 95% sure on it. Me f26 and My husband m25 and I have been married for almost two years and have a 6month old baby.

I work part time only to supplement our income and to pay for the legal process of getting him documented. We are very fortunate that it seems it may be an easy process of maybe 2 years max for his residency but now I’m going to cancel everything and ask for a divorce.

My routine used to be I wake up 1.5hours before him in the morning and make him lunch and pack everything for him for work and have his breakfast coffee and clothes ready for him to wake up, eat get dressed and head out with in 30mins.

He used to be satisfied with what I packed him of freshly made chicken in either honey buffalo, lemon pepper and salad or some sort of chicken wraps ect. Pure healthy food. I did this because I wanted to make his life easier and show him I cared and love him and I’ve done this since we first moved in together more then 3 years ago.

Well recently I’ve had to start including dinner leftovers because he started asking for more food that he was still hungry afterwords, which I thought it was odd because no matter if I work or not he always comes homes to prepared food so even if he wasn’t full he would be okay. But I explained it off with maybe he’s bulking or something.

So I started including what I normally take to work which has caused me to either go without lunch and having to wait til after work or be late for work because I have to wait till the food is ready and take some because I’m breastfeeding and can’t miss eating every time(I’ll leave food going such as in a crockpot or low heat depending how long after I leave he gets home) Well last week when I was packing his lunch I found a unrecognized second fork in his lunchbox and was thrown off so I asked and he said he found it in the kitchen of his work and brought it home. (Odd why didn’t he just leave it?) I had noticed small changes in him that I gaslighted myself into I’m being insecure because I just had a baby but this made the pit of my stomach churn.

So a few days later I decided to go to his work during lunch to “surprise him” with dessert 🍮 and for him to see the baby. Well that was when I found out why he wanted more food. His coworker he told me no longer worked there, who I’d caught him talking too friendly to and I told him it bothered me and I had him remove from everything and block on whatsapp not only still worked there but was eating the lunch I freshly prepared for HIM and he was eating the leftovers.

I didn’t cause a scene instead took pictures and added to my folder of everything he’s done before from simple hearting other girls stories after telling me he didn’t to naked pictures of a coworker from a previous job he got fired from because of her.

I drove home crying to packed my things when I got home I took the bassinet and anything I’d need for the baby and my essentials and went to my sisters and BILs and told them everything and even showed him our conversations from WhatsApp where he told me she no longer worked there.

I normally text him through the day so he started texting me and calling me to see if I was okay and what was for dinner? He was almost off is everything okay? And then he got to the house a hour earlier than usual (which also has me question if he’s been lying about what time he gets off too) and saw mine and the babies things gone. And my letter that he had 7 days to leave my house (my mom gave it to me when I was 20) and that he can communicate with my mother to see the baby when I’m at work or whenever he wants to see her just let her know and I’ll drop off the baby with her. I for the time being don’t want anything to do with him. And I left the printed fotos of them eating lunch laughing together under the letter.

Later that night when I decided I no longer wanted anything to do with him I informed the lawyer (we had a group WhatsApp chat with me him, the lawyer, paralegal and my BIL (our cosponser)) that I no longer was going to need his services. And then messaged the lawyer privately to ask if I could maybe move our contract and the money I’ve paid so far over to his divorce and family practice. He said unfortunately no there’s some clause or something that if we decide to no longer pursue the case we lose the money we’ve invested and also that his immigration practice is a partnership with different people then his family one. But he will just leave our case open till we get a response for our next appointment from the government and if we haven’t worked things out by then, then he will cancel everything.

Well this cause him to go insane because now if he doesn’t get papers he has to choose between his daughter and parents. To either risk never seeing his parents and family again or never seeing his daughter again if he goes over there. He’s begging me to the point I blocked him on everything, he’s came to my BIL house and been told to leave or we are calling police then he later came back drunk with his buddies who then were all scared off by my BIL and his shotgun. I feel so lost, broken and depressed. I also have security at work to make sure he doesn’t show up at my office. My sister tells me to leave him but not to divorce so he can never get with anyone else and get papers but I can’t do that to him.

Ive gone back home (only to check on the house and see if he’s gone im still staying with my sister) and surprisingly there’s no damage to anything and his things (only) are gone. So at least I feel a little relief in that. I’m not looking for advice I know I’m not going back, there is no longer any trust, my mental health wouldn’t be safe in that relationship, and I know I can’t have my daughter grow up with that kind of relationship being an example.

I just needed to put this out there in order for it to solidify in my brain and to be able to reflect that this is now a pattern and he’s gone beyond disrespecting me by now also making me make HER food. I’ve been budgeting trying to make things last, sometimes eating less then I want to or skipping meals if possible (if a meal was heavier of carbs I’d skip since I should have enough for my milk supply) all to be able to pay bills, lawyer his gym membership and supplements. I lose out on rest and sleep because I ensure laundry and the house is kept spotless while the baby sleeps. I’ve basically gone from an independent educated career woman to a 1950s house wife with a job and school, all because I blindly fell for this man. When I say I feel stupid that’s an understatement.

**Anyhow TLDR**: my husband had me (his breastfeeding wife) skipping meals and going out of my way to make him an extra lunch for his side chick at work. And now I have the house cars and he’s lost his nuclear family and ability to get a green card to be able to stay in the states and/or see his family in Mexico ever again.

Edit: My phone seems to post it without paragraphs no matter what I do but I promise i tried to format it even though I was an emotional mess. This time I double spaced the paragraphs to see if that helps idk if it’s my phone or what.

Some things I want to clarify I’ve been seeing in the comments.

No my sister isn’t pushing me to stay in a relationship with him, she’s telling me not to divorce him so that he can’t just go find another woman to marry and use for the green card.

No im not taking anything from him that wasn’t mine before we got married. Before me he lived in a house with 7other men sharing a bedroom with a bunk bed, and he drove a 2000 Buick he had to unplug from the battery in order to use it again. That car got scrapped after the electrical when out. The car he is using is my car I got in high school that got me through high school part time /seasonal jobs and community college.

Also my mom isn’t dead, she gave me my childhood home because I was going to college and it’s 10minute commute from the college. She gave it to me because I’m the last of the kids all my brothers and sisters are at least 10 years older and aside from my sister who’s helping me, they all live in different states.

He left home with a motorcycle his customizing, his gaming systems, clothes and the guest bedroom tv which was the only tv that was not mounted.

Also I’m not keeping his daughter from him. I just personally don’t want to see him because I know he will try to give me a ton of excuses and try to make me “understand” him. He can speak to my sister or mom and they will supervise him to see his daughter whenever he wants to. There is no battle in that. I don’t think he’s a bad father but I just don’t think my relationship with him is the example I want to give my daughter.

Yes, I am Mexican too, my dad came to the states and then later brought my mom and 2 brothers 2 sisters. Took a decade to see each other again which is why I’m so apart from my siblings and the only one born here.

>I’ve been told by my sister to inform everyone that this was my first actual long term relationship. She says that may give people a clue as too why I was so naive.  
It was also very early in the relationship and we weren’t living together yet. I met him when I was traveling around to local jobs where it was known immigrants worked to post and inform them of local resources to help them with medical insurance, free clinics and ESL programs for children and adults. I was working for a seasonal daycare program for agriculture workers.

*How are you going without food if you both work and own your own home?*

>He makes below minimum wage due to undocumentation, I work part time minimum wage because I can’t be away from the baby due to breastfeeding. He also sends money to provide for his parents and younger siblings

*Why did putting more food in his lunch cause budgeting issues?*

>Yes, I was budgeting in order to be able to save money for the lawyer expenses but now that I look back it was basically him paying bills and pocketing the left over for gym and supplements plus tools/paints and whatever while my paycheck was going to groceries, his family in Mexico and diapers.  
And yes, I feel really stupid, naive and blind

*What would get you more child support- him getting a green card and permanent job here or not? Basically when should you divorce?*

>This may be the numbness in me talking at the moment but I don’t need his money he can contribute by buying her diapers clothes and whatever necessities. Now that I’m not catering to him I can leave my part time paper pushing job and find a good daycare for my daughter go back to teaching.  
I might also just sell my second car and lower my car payment. Full time job and one less person in my home also means lower utilities since it’s less utilities being used at home. No mortgage, no stupid expenses on random gym crap/ $40 membership, just protein creatines and supplements was at least $150 a month not to mention whatever he was doing to that junk motorcycle.  
My sister and mom have talked me through finances and my BIL said I could honestly keep my part time job get on government benefits and spend more time with my daughter but I think mentally I need to go back to teaching, and feel the independence of being self reliant again. Food stamps feels like it’s just one thing he will throw in my face. Idk if I’m trying to hold on to what little bit of pride I have left or it’s just the anger I have inside that I wanna show him and his chick I am better without him.

*To another commenter:*

>If I continue with the process I’ll be legally and financially responsible for him for years to come. Supervised visits is due to him never being more the. 3 hours (aka one bottle fed) alone with the baby. Also the fear of him taking my child to another country now that he’s loss everything here and he may just decide to go to Mexico a place where he can’t come back unless he risks his life again, is very real.""

*The other woman:*

>Idk she doesn’t have anything to offer she doesn’t have a legal status either because she overstayed her visa to my understanding from a coworker of his I went to school with. According to her that woman is younger, no legal status or education, no English and she’s already gotten in trouble for being inappropriate in the work place before and if there is proof that they are being inappropriate that will be a strike against him and firing against her. Apparently she likes to call herself “one of the guys” because she’s a woman who works in a male dominated job and degrades women making jokes with the men.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/17r90k1/update_husband_feeding_side_girl_wives_cooking/)**: November 9, 2023 (almost 3 weeks later)**

Sorry it’s been a while since I updated anyone, I’ve been busy sorting out my life and this was supposed to be a throwaway so I didn’t expect it to blow the way it did much less anyone to actually want updates.

\-I guess I’ll start with the most asked question which was if I left him?

Yes, I also got a full check up and I indeed had an infection I was lucky I could treat and be good without any further issues.

This also confirmed his unfaithfulness because as I mentioned I had a baby not long ago and during the whole pregnancy they checked me for everything and they had done a full panel when I was 3months postpartum because I got a UTI and my doctor wanted to ensure it was only that.

\-Did I talk to him to get his side of the story?

Yes, when I went to tell him about the infection I allowed him to speak his mind about everything I only asked him for the truth as there wasn’t anything else for him to ruin, it was completely over at this point.

And here’s a basic tldr:

• He never meant to hurt me, he loves his daughter and me •he enjoyed the attention it was something new and exciting •it took his mind off the stress of bills, kid, my “emotional” state and the general routine his life •life had gotten boring and she entertained him (I’m sorry that your wife organized your previously chaotic life)

That’s about what I believed to be true out of the couple of hours of begging, excuses, gaslighting, and even blaming.

The rest was:

•The infection is a common one that happens because of cow 💩 everywhere and because he goes out and pees outside without washing his hands or something 🙄

•She doesn’t like men she was just one of the guys (cmon really??)

•I only gave her lunch that day! It was just the one time that she forgot her lunch and she asked me because she saw I had two lunches 🙄

•He would never stand so low to break his family why would I make such assumptions (oh so you knew what you were doing)

Once I showed him my MyChart with my results and explained how it’s not a normal infection like ecoli that you can get because of poop and it was an actual transmissible infection.

I also explained that I hadn’t slept with anyone since we met! And how my doctor explained that if I would have had any kind of transmissible diseases I would have known during my pregnancy because not only is it common practice to test for all risks but my high risk pregnancy and preterm labor she tested for all kinds of things to see if she could find the cause of issues and afterword to find the cause of preterm labor.

He admitted it shortly after that he listened to me and saw my drs note (I’ll add I have the best obgyn and she was amazing in listening to me and allowing me to cry and gave me not only support during that moment with even having a nurse take my daughter out for me to cry but also printed me information and ensured me that a simple medicine will make it all go away and I should not see any more issues)

Anyhow

He’s staying at the dairy at some trailer the owner let him borrow and for those who thought she would take him in turns out she’s engaged and she is about to start her wedding and do a adjustment of status (get her papers)

Anyways I’m back to living on my own, my baby is doing great, I have another office job lined up for January, and I have a few universities I’ve applied to, I’m currently going to community college online but if I get into a uni I think I’ll move out of this town, my grandma said she would move with me to help me.

Some days are long like today it’s late at night and I can’t sleep because I miss him. But I’ve been entertaining myself getting rid of stuff in my home to start a new slate and organize everything.

I won’t lie and say I’m doing great. On my days off I don’t get out of bed. My house is clean but my bedroom has my laundry basket over full and I brought out the guest blankets and pillows to use.

People at work have noticed a slowed pace in my work and I was offered time off but I denied it. Although now that somehow the rumor of what happened has reach my job I may take it.

Thank you for all the support everyone. Although I had a few people call me names and talk badly to me in my messages, I appreciate the other people who commented nice things and showed me support.

……………………….

Edit for update:

Woke up to husbands call, he apologized again. I’m Still not budging, but he told me he was talking to some guys at work about free clinics or where they go when their sick and turns out that same woman has been sleeping with a few from there. Idk if around the same time but one of them told my husband where to get treated for free because he got it from her too.

In his apology which sounded more sincere this time but I believe it’s worse because it’s only after he realized he wasn’t special to her just another one of the guys she slept with.

But I say sincere because he didn’t have many excuses instead he seemed to hold himself accountable by saying he had won the lottery and messed up. He begged for a second chance because he doesn’t know what came over him. He says he hates coming home to an empty trailer he misses seeing his daughter the moment after work.

What choked me up was when he said he used to feel more exhausted when he used to come home to us because the baby would be excited to see him and would cry to be held by him, and during the week I would often leave the same easy meals made for him so he could eat while I left to work and he started to feel tired of it. It was a boring routine of same foods during the week. Coming home and having to watch the baby so I could go to work.

That solidified to me that I don’t ever want to find another relationship much less go back to him. The routine I worked hard to put my family together, was a chore to him. I literally dealt with a fussy tired child til he got home so she would mostly sleep and he would only need a single bottle for her but even that was too hard.

He said he would give up the world just to be back into his routine because now he comes home to an empty trailer where it’s just a bed and a fold out table. He hasn’t eaten his diet because he doesn’t have time to prep. He started spending money on lunch because he doesn’t have food made for him. He says he misses the baby so much that he now cries when he goes home.

I told him idk what to tell him about that, but if wanted to see the baby when I go to work he can go see her at my moms who now’s babysits for me. Knowing my mom she makes food and she would never deny him food so he can go over there and eat and be with the baby after work. But I had to go I couldn’t talked anymore.

When I tell yall I’ve never cried so hard in my life, it’s an understatement. It doesn’t help it’s raining today. I think I’m calling into work today and tomorrow talking to my boss about taking those days.

……..

**Edit: November 10 (Same Post)**

I was logging off for a while but I figured I’d update everyone to let you know she found my home and started harassing me now. I guess somehow her fiancée found out and she thinks it was because of me. I feel like things are just going from bad to worse. I had to leave my car in my moms garage and borrow my nephews car which my neighbor let me park in her driveway because she threatened to ruin my car like “I ruined her relationship”, which isn’t just hypothetical but also ironic.

***Relevant Comments:***

*What have you decided regarding legal aspects of this (ie green card)?*

>I don’t want to make any legal decisions at the moment. I’m barely getting through leaving him, I don’t want to also put on too being responsible for my daughter to lose her dad. Because of his stupidity""

*Someone cautions her to not overly listen to reddit here, because this is a decision with huge ramifications. She should just do what feels right for her and her child:*

>I feel like there’s no way out without severe damage. I feel like I’m in that bridge game from squid games except all tiles break at any decision just some have lesser consequences than the others.  
I currently don’t want to make ANY decisions because I feel safe in limbo atm because even though my logical reasoning understands if he gets deported it’s going to be from his decision my emotional reasoning feels responsible for it. I don’t want him back the betrayal and his dishonesty has broken any trust I could ever have and I don’t think it would be good for my mental health to continue a relationship like that.  
I grew up seeing my mom always asking and wondering if my step was cheating or not to the point my mom neglected us because she was so busy ensuring her husband wasn’t cheating. It turned a once loving caring involved mother into a toxic person who would take her daughters out at 3 am to go to shady neighborhoods to see if her husbands car was outside someone’s house.  
I don’t want that for myself or daughter. I saw cheating ruin my mother without her ever being unfaithful, I seen it destroy my sisters first engagement , I have seen my brothers bleed from aggressive cheating women who attack them for wanting to take their kids from toxic environments with drugs and other men.  
Cheating is something I don’t want ANY involvement in and I’ve seen what it does to people. But I also have that responsibility that I want my daughter to have her dad. So in the meantime I am having that distance because I KNOW what is better for her and I am trying my best to stick to the logical conclusion not the emotional one.  
No matter how much I miss him, but I tell myself I don’t miss this person talking to me. I miss the person who made me feel safe, loved and cared for. And even then I’m starting to look back and realize a lot of it was me in a delusional state thinking that him hugging me when I asked, me going to him for kisses, me cuddling to him, was all love. I felt safe with him not because he made me feel safe but because I thought i was. But looking back it’s embarrassing to say I was the one who did a lot of the instigating of affection.  
Maybe some of the people who messaged me saying I was I was psycho were on to something. I’m starting to feel like maybe I was in some delusional state and he was just using me.""

**Legal Advice** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/17rz46f/what_do_i_need_to_file_a_restraining_order_in/)**: November 10, 2023 (Same day as the edit in update post)**

**Title:** What do I need to file a restraining order in Texas?

My husband cheated on me and the woman who he cheated with is now harassing me. Ig she was engaged and was about to go from a visa to residency because of her fiancée but somehow he found out about her relationship with my husband.

She believes it was me but I don’t know who her partner is/was or who told him yet since like 4pm today she’s done the following:

•punctured a hole in one of my tires

•wrote on my front bay window “home wrecker”

• keeps calling me from different numbers and now I’m starting to receive spam text messages after I blocked all of her numbers and stopped answering random numbers

•threaten “I’ll ruin your car like you ruined my relationship ####”

This is all since this afternoon. I called the police but by the time they showed up she was gone. And they said I had no prove of what’s she doing so unless they find her doing it or I have prove their hands are tied.

My mom and step dad said they will put up cameras in my home and my mom is keeping my car at her home. They want me to stay with them too but I don’t want to leave my home incase she tries something against it.

The most I was able to get is a police officer patrolling the area. Meaning they will be close by and randomly pass by.

I’m not sure what to do, I don’t even know who her partner is and I’m already dealing with leaving my husband and now she’s harassing me?

Any advice before it gets worse?

**\*\*\*\*\*New to this sub Comments\*\*\*\*\***

Commenter: Your situation is very similar to mine which started 15 years ago. I made the decision to stay to make sure he got his green card and stayed with his son in turn, I received so much abuse from him. He is a narcissist and he subjected me to all kinds of abuse. I stayed because of my son and finally decided to leave. I was waking him for 15 years and once I left he stopped contact with our child, so all the abuse I endured it was pointless.

>**OOP:** He was never abusive in any physical way but looking back I believe him to be very manipulative and immature. I don’t want to waste anymore time if it was possible I would go back and refuse to ever give him the time of day. It’s been the worst month of my life and going back or if I’d stay I can’t see it would have ever gotten better.  
I’ve loss so much hair from stress my milk supply has plummeted to the point I think I may need to supplement formula soon, my mom tells me to just switch to formula because all my stress is going to go to the baby. But we’ve had such a bad formula shortage I don’t want to.  
I don’t think my situation would have been any better if I would have stayed because I don’t think he would have changed his behavior just hid it better. My trust issues (which I had already prior to this whole mess) would have driven me into the same stress so I’m just give god thanks for him opening my eyes and not putting me in a worse situation.  
I’m sorry your ex was just as horrible and you feel all your suffering was pointless. I believe it tells how important your son was for you and how selfless you are.

Thank you. My baby and I are. Doing better. She’s doing okay atm but unfortunately I’ve started to show some physical symptoms of the extreme stress I’ve been going through. As of Wednesday I haven’t had anymore issues with the woman as my step dad put cameras up and the moment one of the cameras alerted me they captured movement I got on the phone with police.

I’m not sure what she was planning but she spent enough time under my kitchen window and my laundry window that the police showed up and got her for trespassing now with my video evidence I’ve sent it to the guy who was originally our immigration lawyer who said he will be doing a immigration report on her and use my original picture of her “working” and my video evidence of her trespassing and idk what else to prove she’s not only in the country while her visa isn’t active but also working and doing illegal things.

Idk what she wanted but if she would have left me alone I would not have done anything. I didn’t report to her fiancée or do anything against her. Everything naturally happened and now in order to protect myself I’ve had the lawyer report her for me.

**Update** [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/17r90k1/comment/kd59zjg/?context=3)**: December 12, 2023 (about 1 month later, shy of 2 from OG post)**

TLDR: I’m okay, ex is still a ex, ex is still sleeping with others, harassment is less severe but now more people. Ex is either stupider than I thought or manipulating women to harass me. And the girl, my ex and all other illegal workers were fired but to my knowledge not deported.

Now more detail is below ⬇️

We’re okay, I’ve been numb to the whispers and just waiting for the office closing days for holiday vacation to start so I can go to Mexico for a while til our office reopens mid January. I’ve made friends with my areas police officer so he comes by and sweeps the area often and even has had his wife come stay with me and help me with my daughter and help me stay safe.

I quit posting because the post actually blew up enough to where she found out about it I guess I wasn’t vague enough. I guess her husband uses Reddit and after he found out about her cheating and drama he put two and two together and reached out to me and I was able to confirm it was him by phone and met in person to talk. *\[editor's note- this post did get a lot of traction on several different subs and was posted several places outside of reddit, including facebook, youtube, pinterest and tiktok. To me it's actually quite plausible someone found it\]*

Turned out he actually reported her overstay but I guess somehow she didn’t get deported but she along with a few others including my ex were all fired from their job because of his report. According to him she won’t be able to ever renew her visa again because she came as a tourist which means she can’t work. He apologized for her craziness and offered to help me but I turned him down because his involvement might actually make it worse.

My ex started sleeping around and I guess doesn’t learn his lesson. I don’t care anymore though I’ve come to peace he’s not the person I married. I’m so disgusted by him now that I don’t even like him kissing on my daughter. He does come to see her when my mom watches her more now that he got fired and is job haunting. I ask my mom that he leaves before I pick up because he will start crying the moment he sees me and tries to hug me.

Police have been useless aside the friendly officer and his wife. It’s not just that girl now, it’s like 3 girls who are her friends plus a few others who have slept with my ex who harass me because he tells them he loves me and wants me back which I don’t know if he’s stupid or is manipulating them to attack me for him.

Either way I’ve deactivated all of my social medias and the ones I do use are all private or with a different name so I can just use but I just don’t post.

Sorry it’s long and boring.

***OOP adds:***

Also one of the people who was sending me hate messages saying I’m a psychopath I deserved the cheating and talking a lot of crap to me was her, her ex confirmed her account.

Shes finally stopped but I think it’s because she doesn’t know anything of where I live work or do. “Suspiciously “ when I quit informing my ex she also quit finding me. I only meet my ex in public now.

Honestly I’m trying to focus on healing now. After everything I’m disgusted to think back of a time I slaved for him. I look at him and it’s just not the same.

I used to see his green eyes and love his long lashes, now I notice his pimple scares and bad skin.

I used to be excited for him to be home and try to think of something special to surprise him when he got home or what would get him to smile, now I just wonder how many time he was screwing around while I was fixing him something special or preparing everything for him to come home to a warm clean welcoming home.

I never thought I would dread to have to see him or have anxiety when he’s near.

I just focusing on myself now.",541,1742186450.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,73,0.94,False
1jd4r4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1jd4r4g/how_are_your_experiences_with_a_curious_guy/,How are your experiences with a “curious” guy?,"Good day everyone! 

Like what the title says, I am respectfully asking for some of your wisdom in terms of entertaining a “curious” guy. Wanna hear what you guys can share/advice so that ill know how to tread myself and process my thoughts and emotions in this space that we created bc I have noone to share this with.

Here’s my story:
I guess I can say that im a closeted bi/gay guy, just started exploring last year (already have my fair share of experiences). In the T app, an account with just food pictures swiped. A day after, out of boredom and curiosity, checked the profile and it was labelled as “straight”; I swiped back but didn’t have any intentions to message first or any expectations to receive one, but he messaged me. We had our few courteous exchanges here and there, and eventually I had the courage to ask what was the reason for swiping knowing that Im a guy and he’s straight. He answered that he is curious and complimented me that I was the one of the/most good-looking profile he saw from the app (in all modesty). I asked for a picture so that I can reciprocate the compliment and we continued talking in another app. He sent a picture and we did not know each other personally (so safe lol hahah). To describe him: Taller (5’10”), moreno, I can say that he is cute, charismatic and kind, wears an eyeglass, normal physique (wip daw hahaha), with a mustache (this is one of my physical preferences in a guy).

He then asked if pasok ba daw sa next round. This time I’m intrigued, “why would a curious guy ask me to continue our talks?” I said sure. We had our exchanges of playful/naughty banters and eventually did a video call. His voice is deep and big, my impression was “parang yung isa sa mga makulit/bully na lalaki sa highschool na ayaw kong lapitan o kausapin”, sure enough, he said that he was this kind of a student daw, a bit lang daw amppp hahaha. During the entire call, he repeatedly teased that I’m very cute and he wanted to meet and kiss me. Asked if is it ok to call me baby. I just laughed and thought of that as a joke. I thought to myself “This is too good to be true and abnormally fast, clearly an infatuation”. So I was still on my guard which he noticed. I asked him some things that were important for me to know.

He and I are the same, our exes were women. I never had a relationship with a guy before (but ofc Ive had my hookup experiences and rejected courtships). He didn’t have any experience with a guy, emotionally and physically. I expressed to him that this will be a kind of a problem because maybe he will have the tendency to find a woman again after “experimenting” with a guy, like me, and come to a conclusion that “this” kind of set-up isn’t for him. He acknowledged. Nonsmoker, but a party-goer and a drinker (I can say that he is outgoing, while I am very introverted). During the time that we talked, he expressed that he wants to court me and be in a LTR considering our present age; jokingly asked from time to time “So tayo na?”. He also politely asked if is it ok to say iloveyou. Mind you, we did not meet yet. So I said that he needs to chill, that he should get to know me first, to see my person realtime and assess if he legitimately likes me. But as a compromise, I said that he can say cuter/playful versions like “labyu”, etc.

Fast forward to the day that we planned to meet (this recent weekend lang). He invited me to go this bar together with his friends. This I considered a red flag. “This will be the very first time that we’ll meet and is inviting me to a bar with his friends? Very inappropriate”. I just kept this to myself and said that I’m down but Ill just be on a separate table because I don’t want his friends to think something about him. And, I don’t go to bars that much, im really introverted. They were veryyyy late from the agreed time and I was frustrated already because I was at the place, good thing there’s a nearby coffee shop from that the same compound with the bar. I told him that ill just meet him in person (para di masayang ang pinunta ko) then will just go home afterwards, I had no intention in partying with them zzzz. He sneaked off and eventually met me at the coffee shop, we had our formal introductions and small talks. I jokingly expressed to him about my frustration during that time and he apologized, said that he really wanted to go first and leave his friends to have more time with me. He invited me again to enter the bar with him but I have decided to go home na, which he respected naman. As we said our goodbyes, he called my attention one last time and mouthed “labyuu”. I was so surprised that my reaction was just “Psshhhhh”.
While driving home, I pondered, “Can a curious guy really do what he did a while ago? Can he really commit? Will I just be a phase in his life? Will this initial infatuation really be something more and serious?” and everything in between. 

He’s aware that I’m still guarded, that whatever may come will come. I have my growing career that Im currently locked in to, that I’ll be fine whether or not someone will be together with me. But boy, he sure knows how to make me giggle and be bubbly, he has been in my mind most time of the day. He is a distraction that I dont want to disappear and I really enjoy the time that I have invested to him. Currently, we r still talking, planning for our next hangout, i guess. Should I take the risk?

I apologize for the long read. Thank you everyone, be safe.",10,1742186442.0,phlgbt,2,0.86,False

For days on end, John and Evan looked outside their prison cell window and waited and waited for a day with thunderstorms. Eventually, a thunderstorm came at 1:30 AM with lightning crashing down from the heavens onto Earth.

“I’ve got the 20-foot lightning rod made of antennas.” Evan said.

“I’ve got the jar of battery acid and the bicycle chains that are attached to car hood hooks as grappling hooks.” John said.

Evan looked down the hallway to see if there were any guards around, and there were no guards in their area.

“Coast is clear!” Evan loudly whispered to John.

Evan and John tiptoed towards the electrical closet room and Evan stuck the lightning rod made of antennas up through a small crack in the ceiling into the sky where rain came pouring down. John then wired that lightning rod into the central electrical control panel.

“Now we just have to wait for it to be struck by lightning so that the prison’s power goes out and we can hop over the electric fence.” Evan said.

Two hours later, John and Evan saw a lightning bolt come through the small crack in the ceiling traveling down the lightning rod made of antennas and into the central electrical control panel, shorting it out. All of the lights in the prison went dark, and they realized that they successfully shorted out the power in the prison.

“Hurry, power-walk this way towards the prison yard. Don’t run or you’ll draw attention to yourself and the guards will notice you. If someone notices us and tries to catch us, then switch from power-walking to running.” John instructed Evan.

John and Evan powerwalked about 500 feet from the electrical closet to the backdoor past a few security guards who were all asleep, which makes sense considering that it was 3:30 in the morning.

John and Evan walked through the empty prison yard lit by the moon to the first wall.

“We’ll both take turns using my grappling hook first to get past this first wall with the electric fence, and we’ll take turns using your grappling hook to get past the second with the barbed wire.” Evan directed John. 

“Really, why can’t each of us just use one grappling hook for both walls?” John asked.

“Because these grappling hooks are single-use because once you’ve used them to ascend and descend the walls, you would have to re-ascend the walls so you could retrieve the grappling hooks, and then jump off the wall to unhook it and retrieve it. This would be both time-consuming and dangerous because if you jump off of the walls incorrectly, you could break a bone.” Evan explained.

“Well shit, I guess you’re right,” John replied
Evan held onto the end of the bicycle chain that was not attached to the car hood hooks, and threw the bicycle chain into the air, causing the end attached to the car hood hooks to latch onto the top of the electric fence that was shorted out due to the power outage. Evan went first, climbing up the bicycle chain with all of his might. He almost slipped, but he made it up to the top.

“Now it’s your turn to climb up. Once we're both at the top, I will start climbing down, as neither of us can climb down until both of us have climbed up.” Evan explained

“And why is that?” John asked

“Because someone has to re-adjust the grappling hook for us to start lowering ourselves on the other side of this wall in a safe manner, and if I have already lowered myself by the time you start climbing up, then no one will be at the top to re-adjust the grappling hook.” Evan replied.

“Fair point.” John replied.

John, who was much stronger than Evan, used his strength to propel himself up the bicycle chain. The chain almost broke under John’s weight, but John made it to the top successfully. Once John and Evan both were at the top of the wall, Evan re-adjusted the grappling hook position so that it pointed down the other side of the wall, allowing Evan and John to descend the wall on the other side. Evan climbed down first, then John. 

“One wall down, one wall to go,” John said

“With this 2nd wall with the barbed wires, we will treat it exactly like the first but because of the barbed wires, I will pour this battery acid on it, which will make that part of the barbed wire deteriorate which will allow us to go through the barbed wire and escape,” Evan explained
John grabbed his bicycle chain on the end that was not attached to the car hood hook and threw the other end into the air, as it latched onto the top of the 2nd wall with the barbed wire. Evan then grabbed the jar filled with battery acid and shoved it into his back pocket and climbed up the bicycle chain to the top of the wall with the barbed wire. Evan got out the jar and poured the battery acid onto the barbed wire, which caused it to melt, creating a clear passageway for John and Evan. John then climbed up the chain with Evan. Evan then re-adjusted the chain for it to go down the other side of the wall and slowly descended it to the other side, finally making his way to the outside of the prison into freedom. John followed Evan down the chain and was now also on the outside of the prison. As the sun started to rise, Evan and John heard sirens activating in the prison, meaning that they knew they had fixed the damaged power system and that they knew that Evan and John had escaped.

“First things first, we will be too recognizable in our orange uniforms. There’s a dumpster filled with all kinds of clothes with only tiny holes in them in the garbage behind the clothing store over there. Let’s get some new clothes so we don’t get caught.” John said. 
Evan and John both went into the dumpster and got themselves new clothes with a few holes in them and threw out their old prison uniforms so that they would not get caught.

“Look over there!” John said “There's a boxcar with a homeless person riding in it. Maybe we can ride in it to get away from this prison so that we don’t get caught.” John said.

“Good idea,” Evan replied.

Evan and John ran towards the boxcar train with a homeless man on it and hopped on. As soon as they hopped on, the homeless man said 

“Looks like this is my stop.”And hopped off. 

The boxcar train whisked Evan and John hundreds of miles away.

**Chapter 8: The Breakup**

The boxcar train that was carrying John and Evan was now hundreds of miles away west of the prison in an abandoned wilderness.

“Ok, so now that we have escaped prison, what will we do next?” Evan asked.

“We’ll probably flee to Mexico where the tax laws are very loosely enforced and we can get away with not paying taxes and not going to prison.” John replied.

“But I don’t want to go to Mexico, I want to go to Canada where there is an enormous welfare state and I can easily get away with welfare fraud and not go to prison,” Evan complained. 

“Well, I’m sure as hell not going to Canada where I’d be forced to spend all of my hard-earned tax dollars on lazy bums like you!” John yelled.

“Did you just call me a lazy bum?!” Evan snapped back as he grabbed John’s shoulder.

“That’s exactly what you are, a lazy bum!” John snapped as he threw Evan to the floor inside the boxcar train. “You’ve never worked a day in your life and all you ever do is leech off of hard-working taxpayers like me to pay for your luxurious lifestyle while I get none of the luxuries you can get. That’s exactly why I stopped paying taxes 20 years ago!”

“Fine, I’m going to Canada by myself.” Evan declared.

“I’m going to Mexico by myself.” John declared.

The boxcar train then stopped at Millennium Park Station in Chicago with networks of trains and train tracks going every which way. John and Evan both parted ways, as John snuck onto the back of a train going south to Mexico, while Evan snuck onto the back of a train going north to Canada. 

**Chapter 9: Monotony**

Once Evan rode that train from Chicago to Toronto he got a job as a safety inspector at a nuclear power plant and bought a cheap apartment downtown. The next few weeks were a steady routine for Evan: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed:

and so on. 

Evan loved having a steady routine for once, as this was something he had never had before as a criminal who was always running from the law. In Canada, he got a steady job and never resorted to welfare fraud. One day Evan was watching the news when he heard a disturbing report.

“This just in, a man named John was kidnapped and brutally beaten by the infamous gang MS-13” John’s full name and face were shown across the TV screen and a video was shown of John being tortured.

“Good riddance!” Evan said to himself “That’s what he gets for not listening to me and going to Mexico instead. I hope your tax evasion scheme worked out well.”

A few more weeks went by when Evan was subject to the same old monotonous routine: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed.  

And so on and so on.
Evan started to hate the monotony of the routine he once loved. He realized just how boring life had become without someone to argue with like John. Evan then became so lonely without John or anyone else in his life that he found himself pacing around the floor at his lunch break talking to himself, and his coworkers started to get weirded out. 

“Sure, I might be bored and lonely, but am I going to risk life and limb just to save someone I love to hate?” Evan said to himself while he was pacing around the lunchroom floor.

“Evan, what the hell are you doing? You’ve been pacing around talking to yourself in public all lunch break? You seem lonely and you need a friend!” Rick, one of Evan’s coworkers, yelled at Evan while they were in the coffee break room at the nuclear power plant. 

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!” 

Rick's words rang in Evan’s ears over and over again.

“A friend eh?” Evan said to himself. “I think I know just where one is in Tijuana, Mexico who just so happens to need my help.”

Evan sprinted out the door toward the parking lot

“What are you doing this time!?” Rick asked

“Risking my life to save someone I hate for reasons I don’t quite understand. Gotta go!” 

Evan yelled back at Rick as he sprinted out the door. He ran over to the nearby train station where he booked a ticket to Tijuana.

“Time to fight a drug cartel and kick ass!” Evan whispered to himself as he boarded the train to Tijuana.

**Chapter 10 Evan frees John**

The train got off in Tijuana in a train station in a sketchy ally with city maps for both English and Spanish telling tourists where various attractions and shops are, and one of them was a gun shop, which would allow Evan to get his hand on a weapon so he could take down MS-13 and save John. 
“Why is a gun shop one of the primary tourist destinations listed on the map?” Evan thought to himself out loud

“Mexico has very loose gun laws unlike Canada and the US, so people from across the border in San Diego cross the border all the time just to get guns.” a tourist responded to Evan.

“Oh, you speak English?” Evan asked.

“Yeah, virtually everyone in Tijuana speaks both English and Spanish,” the tourist responded.

Evan then found a currency exchange station where he exchanged his Canadian dollars for Mexican pesos. Evan then walked a few blocks to the nearby gun shop where he purchased a gun and some ammo to take down MS-13 to save his friend. As soon as he started to wonder how he could find MS-13, he saw a guy with a large MS-13 tattoo and asked him if he could join MS-13 as a new member.

“That’s a talk between you and the leader. I will take you to him, but to join MS-13, you first must prove your loyalty to him.” The guy with the MS-13 tattoo explained. 

Evan followed him through a maze of complex allies, each one sketchier than the last, into an enormous run-down warehouse-looking building with a 10-foot pyramid structure in the center, and at the top of the pyramid was a golden chair with a fat man sitting in it.

“Why have you come to bother me?!” the fat man snapped.

“We have a new potential recruit to MS-13.” the guy with the MS-13 tattoo replied.

“Hmmmmm, that’s odd, we haven’t had a recruit in several years. Well, I guess we could always use more members.” the fat man said to himself “Your loyalty test to this organization will be that you are required to assassinate Tijuana city council member Luis Francheco and have his corpse brought to me. He is the primary member of the Tijuana city council who is trying to push corruption out of the Tijuana city government and we rely on that corruption so that we can continue to bribe the government officials so that they don’t arrest us. Do you understand?”

“Yes sir,” Evan replied. “Do you by chance happen to know where you guys keep your prisoners?” 

“That is confidential information that I can not tell you until you have brought Luis Francheso’s corpse to me.” The fat man replied.

“Understood.” Evan replied.

Evan walked out of the MS-13 layer and walked a few blocks until he saw an ally where he could buy some roofies. Evan then ran his next errand to a local grocery store where he purchased a big bottle of wine and a pen and a thank you card where he wrote “Thank you Mr. Franchesco for being the best city council member, we have a gift for you in the form of a bottle of wine.” Once Evan was out of the store, he opened the bottle of wine and opened the package of roofies and dumped the roofies into the wine bottle. Last but not least, Evan got on a bus and went to the outskirts of town where he saw a farm. He snuck onto that farm and slaughtered one of the pigs and emptied the blood from the pig’s carcass into the same jar he used to carry the battery acid during their escape from prison. Evan then rode the bus to city hall and went into Mr. Franchesco’s office and put the thank you card and the bottle of wine on his desk. Evan then heard Mr. Franchesco’s footsteps down the hallway approaching his room at the end of the hallway, so Evan hid in the closet in Mr. Franchesco’s office and peeped through the ventilation desk to see Mr. Francesco sit down in his office chair.

“Oh Boy!” Mr. Franchesco said to himself “Someone’s left a big bottle of wine and a thank you card for me. I normally don’t drink at work, but it’s 4 pm, so I guess we can make an exception here. Plus it’s been a long stressful day for me. “Juan, my assistant, can you take a sip of this wine for me please so that I don’t get poisoned?.. Oh, I forgot, he’s out sick today.”

Evan quietly breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing that Mr. Franchesco’s taster assistant was out sick today, and Mr. Francesco took a sip of the wine and instantly passed out. Evan then looked in the hallways to see that no one was coming, and he saw that no one was there, so Evan dragged Mr. Franchesco’s unconscious body out the door. Once he was out the door, Evan dumped the vile of pig blood all over Mr. Franchesco’s dead body to make it look like he killed him. Evan then used all of his strength to drag Mr. Franchesco’s body to the MS-13 lay and present it below the fat man who led MS-13. 

“Excellent work.” the fat man said to Evan. “You are officially now our newest member.”

“So where exactly does MS-13 keep their prisoners?”

“We keep them at 4-303 Bolivar Rd. When you get out of the warehouse, you make a right out of the driveway onto our street and go down it 6 blocks and then you make a left onto Bolivar Road. You will then go down 3 and a half more blocks and you will come across 4-303 bolivar road on your left. I am granting you this MS-13 badge. Just show the guards this badge and they will let you in. May I ask why do you want to go into our gang prison?” The fat man replied.

“Because there’s this guy in there named John who I am going to shoot with my pistol because he’s behind on his mortgage to me. I lent him a car, and he has now been behind on his monthly payments for 6 months in a row, so I’m going to show him why you don’t mess with me” Evan responded.
“Well, we hate John too. We only captured him in the hope that we could hold him ransom for the US government, and because they have refused to buy him from us, he’s essentially a useless prisoner who you are free to kill.” The fat man replied. 

John walked 6 blocks, turned left at Bolivar Road, walked 3 and a half blocks more, and found 4-303 Bolivar Road and opened the door to get in. Once he opened that door, there was a short hallway with a door at the end with two more guards who both had guns both pointed at Evan and announced.

“Halt! Please show us your ID and your purpose for the entry” 

“I have been sent here to kill prisoner John,” Evan announced. “The boss ordered for him to be killed because we were unable to sell him for ransom back to the US government. Here is my ID.” Evan showed him the badge

“Your entry is granted!” the guards stepped out of the way and withdrew their guns. “Here is the key to Evan’s cell.”

 Evan then walked through the maze of cells filled with prisoners who were beaten, bloodied, and battered, until he came across the one he was here for. He approached John’s cell and unlocked it.

“Evan?” John asked, with blood pouring out of wounds on his torso and arms

“Yes, it’s me, Evan,” Evan replied. “I’m here to set you free.”

Evan and John then both ran out of the prison, with Evan using his gun to shoot both of the prison guards in the knee and freeing John from the torture of the MS-13 prison. 

“I can't believe you risked your life to save me?!” John said as he hugged Evan and cried

“Shhhh!” Evan whispered loudly “We have to be quiet and remain out of sight. MS-13 could send out reinforcements anytime.

As John and Evan ran through the city of Tijuana towards the train station, they passed by this electronic store with an enormous glass window with multiple TVs in the store showing through the glass onto the streets where people could watch the TVs. One of those TVs in the electronics store showing on the street had the news on, and it showed that the President of the United States’s 13-year-old daughter had been kidnapped by a gang called the Tijuana Cartel and that the president was offering a reward of a million dollars to whoever could rescue the president’s daughter.

“Are you thinking what I am thinking?” John asked Evan
“That we could get a million dollars from saving the President’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel?” Evan replied.

“Better yet, we could get a presidential pardon for our crimes if we save the president’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel and get our criminal records expunged.” John replied

“Good idea.” Evan replied.

“Freeze” John and Evan both heard as five gunmen and a leader approached John and Evan at the electronics store with the TVs that showed out into the streets and were about to shoot them then and there. 

“Do you have any last words before MS-13 kills you?” The leader of the gunman asked.
 Evan pulled out his gun to try to shoot them in self-defense, but it was no use as Evan was out of ammo and at the mercy of the five MS-13 gunmen.

“Thanks for saving my life by rescuing me from the MS-13 prison. John said to Evan “Even if it only extended my life for five more minutes.”

“Be prepared to die!” the leader of the gunman said as the five gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at Evan and John, as they flinched, knowing that this would be the end. The five gunmen all had their fingers on the triggers about to shoot and end Evan and John’s life when suddenly the five gunmen and their leader all fell and had bullet-holes in their torsos with blood oozing out on the sidewalk at the Electronic store with the TVs pointing out to the streets. 

“Whoever you are, thank you for saving our lives.” Evan and John said.

“Call me Enedina, the leader of the Tijuana Cartel.” A woman stepped out of a shadowy ally with smoke coming out of her AR-15. “MS-13 has been one of our biggest rivals in the gang war, and your escape has certainly made headlines in the news of the criminal underworld, and for publicly slapping the face of our biggest rival, we want to make you the newest member of the Tijuana Cartel.

“Hold on, I need to have one moment alone with my associate,” Evan said

“Take your time,” Enedina said

“John, is this the same Tijuana Cartel that has kidnapped the President’s daughter?” Evan whispered to John.

“It sure is.” John replied, whispering to Evan. 

“Ok, so we will join and then free the president’s daughter.” Evan replied whispering to John.
“We will join the Tijuana Cartel with you.” Evan and John said to Enedina.

“It’s always good to have two new members,” Enedina replied.

**Chapter 11: a presidential pardon**

John and Evan were welcomed into the layer of the Tijuana Cartel, and they asked Enedina if they could have some more bandages for John’s wounds and ammo for Evan’s gun and Enedina happily provided those to them. 

“Enedina, would you know where we keep the Tijuana Cartel gang prisoners?” John asked

“We keep them at 3-506 Zaragoza Road. You have to first get a right out of the driveway and then go down the street for 4 blocks and make a left onto Zaragoza Road. You go down the road for about half a block and you will see 3-506 Zaragoza on your right. May I ask why you want to go down to where the prisoners are kept?” Enedina replied.

“We were looking to kill the President of the United State’s daughter. We have fed her for days, yet the president still shows no sign of paying her ransom or doing anything, so we have no other choice but to kill her as she means nothing to us now.” Evan replied.

“Yeah, you have a fair point. I see no reason why the president’s daughter needs to live. We’ve broadcasted her face all over the news for days and everyone knows that she has been kidnapped and if the president wanted to save her or pay her ransom, he would have easily done that by now. I permit you to go kill the president’s daughter in her jail cell. Here’s a Tijuana Cartel badge. Present this badge to the guards outside and they should let you into the President’s daughter’s cell. 

John and Evan took a right out of the driveway and walked 4 blocks, turned left, walked another half block, and came across 3-506 Zaragoza Road. They opened the door and then walked into a very short 5-foot-long hallway with another door at the end with two guards with guns both pointed at them.

“Halt!” The guards shouted “Show us your authorization and purpose for the entry.”

“We are with the Tijuana Cartel and we have been sent here to kill the President’s daughter, as we have held her for ransom for days, and yet the president has done nothing to save her or pay her ransom, so we have decided that the best use of resources is to simply kill her so we don’t waste our resources feeding her.” John stated.

“Here is our Tijuana Cartel badge handed to us by Enedina.” Evan stated.
 
“You are free to enter our prison, here’s the key to the president’s daughter’s cell.” The guards stated.

John and Evan walked through the Tijuana Cartel Prison with prisoners in every shade of orange, each one looking scarier than the last until they came across the sweet-looking face of the president’s 13-year-old daughter. John unlocked the key while Evan entered the cell and leaned into the president’s daughter’s ear and whispered that they were there to save her life.

“Yippie!” the President’s daughter shouted.

“Shhhhh!” Evan whispered loudly.

 Evan and the President’s daughter exited the cell and joined up with John who was outside of the cell. John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all walked swiftly but calmly towards the entrance they came in, as Evan got out his gun and shot the guards in the knees before they could suspect anything, meaning that John and Evan had now just freed the President’s daughter. The trio then started running away from the prison northward towards the US border.

“Next stop, to San Diego across the border,” Evan said panting while running. “I brought a makeshift grappling hook made of bicycle chains and a car hood that we can use to hop the Tortilla wall that separates Tijuana and San Diego.”

“Ugh, do we have to use one of those? Last time I used one of those I almost fell off of the prison . . . I mean a city wall.” John coughed and awkwardly corrected himself as he noticed the president’s 13-year-old daughter look at him as he slipped up and said he escaped from prison.

“Wait, you two are outlaws?” The president’s daughter asked John and Evan.

“*sigh* yes,” John and Evan said in unison as the trio all continued to pant in unison as they were running towards the border while talking.

“Awesome!” the president’s daughter squealed. “I've always wanted to meet an outlaw, but my dad won’t let me walk outside without secret service supervision and engage in any fun activities that kids my age do like spray painting and skateboarding.”

The trio continued to run and they were less than a block away from the Tortilla wall at the US-Mexico border when 6 men with guns all blocked the street in front of them and pointed their guns at the trio and said

“Freeze, we have orders to terminate you by the Tijuana Cartel!”

Evan once again reached for his pistol and tried to fire it, but it was jammed and unable to fire. John, Evan, and The President’s daughter all cowered there helplessly in fear and saw their entire life flash before their eyes, and time stood still, knowing that the gun of the Tijuana Cartel was about to end their very lives within the flash of a second.

“On my command fire,” Their leader shouted. 

The 6 gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at the trio, when all of a sudden, two attack helicopters with American flags came out of the air and shot all 6 gunmen, and all 6 fell with bullet holes in their torsos and blood oozing out on the sidewalk less than a block away from the Tortilla wall. After the two attack helicopters shot down the 6 gunmen, Airforce One descended onto the ground in front of the trio. The president opened the door to the plane and the stairs descended to the sidewalk where John, Evan, and the president’s daughter were all standing.

“Hop on in honey!” The president announced “Who are your two new friends”

“They just saved me from prison in the Tijuana Cartel by pretending to join the organization and then double-crossing them to save me.” The president’s daughter explained. “Can they come too?”

The president stood there for a long moment, seeing that these guys were sketchy and looked like convicts themselves, the president would normally let these types of guys into his plane, but considering that they had just saved his daughter, he reluctantly agreed to let them in. The trio climbed into Air Force One, and Airforce One took off towards Washington DC.

“Before I say anything else, I just want to say that I am incredibly sorry that I didn’t come and save you earlier and that you were captured for over a week.” The president went on. “You see when I first got to Tijuana to have a meeting with the President of Mexico, I received anonymous death threats, so I was ordered by my secret service to abandon my meeting in Mexico and to flee to an undisclosed location in Nevada that had no cell signal, broadband, or internet for my safety so I had no way of knowing that you were captured. Before I left Tijuana for the undisclosed place in Nevada, I decided that for your safety, it would be best for you to stay behind in Tijuana with my presidential aide named Edwin, as I knew that keeping you with me in New Mexico would put you in more danger as I am the one they are after not you. If I had known that Edwin was such a heavy sleeper and wouldn’t detect kidnappers breaking into the house in the middle of the night, I would have never assigned him to protect you and I would have assigned someone else to protect you instead. I only found out that you had been captured once the secret service traveled to my undisclosed place in Nevada by car and informed me that you had been captured.” The president explained.

“It doesn’t matter now.” The president’s daughter said “What matters is that you and I are safe and together” as they both hugged and embraced, as a tear fell on both of their cheeks
. 
“And you two” the president motioned towards Evan and John “What made you two risk your life to save my daughter.”
Evan told his story about how he is a far-left activist who was arrested for welfare fraud, befriended his assigned cellmate who was a far-right activist who was arrested for tax evasion, and how they worked together to Escape prison. Then Evan went on to describe how they both planned to flee the country and for Canada, but then John and Evan got into a fight when they got out of prison and John went to Mexico while Evan went to Canada, and Evan found out that John had been captured while watching the news, so Evan went down to Mexico to save his friend. While they were in Mexico, they both saw the news about how the President of the United States’s daughter had been kidnapped, and they both agreed to break her out to receive a presidential pardon for their crimes. 

“A welfare queen and a tax evader working together?! That’s odd.” The president responded. “If only I could get along with members on the opposite side of the aisle in Congress as you do.” The president chuckled.

“Would you grant us a pardon?” John asked, “We have been through hell and back just to get to here, and we saved your daughter from death and we promise that we won’t do it again after having been on the run from the law for several months which taught us our lesson.”

“Normally, I would say no, but because of your heroism in risking your life to save my daughter from death, I will agree to grant you a full presidential pardon for your crimes, but be warned however, this pardon does not protect you from future crimes that you commit, so you can’t abuse the welfare system anymore and you can’t evade taxes anymore.” The president said.

“We promise we’ll be good from now on!” John and Evan said.

“This might be a weird request for you guys, but how would you two like to work at an entry-level job in the FBI for me? Our FBI has currently been ineffective at catching criminals, and I think the reason why they are is that none of them are ex-criminals, meaning they know nothing about how a criminal thinks or behaves, so we were wondering if you would like to take on a job in the FBI hunting these guys down?”

“That sounds good!” John squealed.

“Having a steady job for once in my life would mean that I would no longer have to resort to a life of crime” Evan cheered. 

“Thank you, Mr. President!” John and Evan said.

“You’re welcome.” The president replied.

Air Force One had just touched down in Washington DC, and John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all decided that they would get motorcycles, matching switchblades, and matching tattoos that read “Kill all betrayers” (although the President’s daughter’s was a temporary tattoo, as she wasn’t old enough to get a real one.) The president then approached John, Evan, and the President’s daughter with their matching motorcycles, tattoos, and switchblades, looking at his daughter with disgust for her new punk lifestyle.

“Honey, would you like to come with your dad on a cool diplomatic trip in Wilmington Delaware? There would be lots of tall chairs for you to sit in.” The president bribed his daughter.

“No thanks. I’m tired of going on trips that involve people in itchy clothing bitching at each other. I’d rather hang out with my cool new friends John and Evan!” The president’s daughter replied as she mounted on her motorcycle, as John and Evan each mounted onto their own.

“Well, you three have fun while I’m gone!” The president shouted as the three of them raced away on their motorcycles. 

“Secret service, follow them at a distance!” The president whispered to his secret service agents who proceeded to get in their motorcycles and follow them at a distance.

For days on end, John and Evan looked outside their prison cell window and waited and waited for a day with thunderstorms. Eventually, a thunderstorm came at 1:30 AM with lightning crashing down from the heavens onto Earth.

“I’ve got the 20-foot lightning rod made of antennas.” Evan said.

“I’ve got the jar of battery acid and the bicycle chains that are attached to car hood hooks as grappling hooks.” John said.

Evan looked down the hallway to see if there were any guards around, and there were no guards in their area.

“Coast is clear!” Evan loudly whispered to John.

Evan and John tiptoed towards the electrical closet room and Evan stuck the lightning rod made of antennas up through a small crack in the ceiling into the sky where rain came pouring down. John then wired that lightning rod into the central electrical control panel.

“Now we just have to wait for it to be struck by lightning so that the prison’s power goes out and we can hop over the electric fence.” Evan said.

Two hours later, John and Evan saw a lightning bolt come through the small crack in the ceiling traveling down the lightning rod made of antennas and into the central electrical control panel, shorting it out. All of the lights in the prison went dark, and they realized that they successfully shorted out the power in the prison.

“Hurry, power-walk this way towards the prison yard. Don’t run or you’ll draw attention to yourself and the guards will notice you. If someone notices us and tries to catch us, then switch from power-walking to running.” John instructed Evan.

John and Evan powerwalked about 500 feet from the electrical closet to the backdoor past a few security guards who were all asleep, which makes sense considering that it was 3:30 in the morning.

John and Evan walked through the empty prison yard lit by the moon to the first wall.

“We’ll both take turns using my grappling hook first to get past this first wall with the electric fence, and we’ll take turns using your grappling hook to get past the second with the barbed wire.” Evan directed John. 

“Really, why can’t each of us just use one grappling hook for both walls?” John asked.

“Because these grappling hooks are single-use because once you’ve used them to ascend and descend the walls, you would have to re-ascend the walls so you could retrieve the grappling hooks, and then jump off the wall to unhook it and retrieve it. This would be both time-consuming and dangerous because if you jump off of the walls incorrectly, you could break a bone.” Evan explained.

“Well shit, I guess you’re right,” John replied
Evan held onto the end of the bicycle chain that was not attached to the car hood hooks, and threw the bicycle chain into the air, causing the end attached to the car hood hooks to latch onto the top of the electric fence that was shorted out due to the power outage. Evan went first, climbing up the bicycle chain with all of his might. He almost slipped, but he made it up to the top.

“Now it’s your turn to climb up. Once we're both at the top, I will start climbing down, as neither of us can climb down until both of us have climbed up.” Evan explained

“And why is that?” John asked

“Because someone has to re-adjust the grappling hook for us to start lowering ourselves on the other side of this wall in a safe manner, and if I have already lowered myself by the time you start climbing up, then no one will be at the top to re-adjust the grappling hook.” Evan replied.

“Fair point.” John replied.

John, who was much stronger than Evan, used his strength to propel himself up the bicycle chain. The chain almost broke under John’s weight, but John made it to the top successfully. Once John and Evan both were at the top of the wall, Evan re-adjusted the grappling hook position so that it pointed down the other side of the wall, allowing Evan and John to descend the wall on the other side. Evan climbed down first, then John. 

“One wall down, one wall to go,” John said

“With this 2nd wall with the barbed wires, we will treat it exactly like the first but because of the barbed wires, I will pour this battery acid on it, which will make that part of the barbed wire deteriorate which will allow us to go through the barbed wire and escape,” Evan explained
John grabbed his bicycle chain on the end that was not attached to the car hood hook and threw the other end into the air, as it latched onto the top of the 2nd wall with the barbed wire. Evan then grabbed the jar filled with battery acid and shoved it into his back pocket and climbed up the bicycle chain to the top of the wall with the barbed wire. Evan got out the jar and poured the battery acid onto the barbed wire, which caused it to melt, creating a clear passageway for John and Evan. John then climbed up the chain with Evan. Evan then re-adjusted the chain for it to go down the other side of the wall and slowly descended it to the other side, finally making his way to the outside of the prison into freedom. John followed Evan down the chain and was now also on the outside of the prison. As the sun started to rise, Evan and John heard sirens activating in the prison, meaning that they knew they had fixed the damaged power system and that they knew that Evan and John had escaped.

“First things first, we will be too recognizable in our orange uniforms. There’s a dumpster filled with all kinds of clothes with only tiny holes in them in the garbage behind the clothing store over there. Let’s get some new clothes so we don’t get caught.” John said. 
Evan and John both went into the dumpster and got themselves new clothes with a few holes in them and threw out their old prison uniforms so that they would not get caught.

“Look over there!” John said “There's a boxcar with a homeless person riding in it. Maybe we can ride in it to get away from this prison so that we don’t get caught.” John said.

“Good idea,” Evan replied.

Evan and John ran towards the boxcar train with a homeless man on it and hopped on. As soon as they hopped on, the homeless man said 

“Looks like this is my stop.”And hopped off. 

The boxcar train whisked Evan and John hundreds of miles away.

**Chapter 8: The Breakup**

The boxcar train that was carrying John and Evan was now hundreds of miles away west of the prison in an abandoned wilderness.

“Ok, so now that we have escaped prison, what will we do next?” Evan asked.

“We’ll probably flee to Mexico where the tax laws are very loosely enforced and we can get away with not paying taxes and not going to prison.” John replied.

“But I don’t want to go to Mexico, I want to go to Canada where there is an enormous welfare state and I can easily get away with welfare fraud and not go to prison,” Evan complained. 

“Well, I’m sure as hell not going to Canada where I’d be forced to spend all of my hard-earned tax dollars on lazy bums like you!” John yelled.

“Did you just call me a lazy bum?!” Evan snapped back as he grabbed John’s shoulder.

“That’s exactly what you are, a lazy bum!” John snapped as he threw Evan to the floor inside the boxcar train. “You’ve never worked a day in your life and all you ever do is leech off of hard-working taxpayers like me to pay for your luxurious lifestyle while I get none of the luxuries you can get. That’s exactly why I stopped paying taxes 20 years ago!”

“Fine, I’m going to Canada by myself.” Evan declared.

“I’m going to Mexico by myself.” John declared.

The boxcar train then stopped at Millennium Park Station in Chicago with networks of trains and train tracks going every which way. John and Evan both parted ways, as John snuck onto the back of a train going south to Mexico, while Evan snuck onto the back of a train going north to Canada. 

**Chapter 9: Monotony**

Once Evan rode that train from Chicago to Toronto he got a job as a safety inspector at a nuclear power plant and bought a cheap apartment downtown. The next few weeks were a steady routine for Evan: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed:

and so on. 

Evan loved having a steady routine for once, as this was something he had never had before as a criminal who was always running from the law. In Canada, he got a steady job and never resorted to welfare fraud. One day Evan was watching the news when he heard a disturbing report.

“This just in, a man named John was kidnapped and brutally beaten by the infamous gang MS-13” John’s full name and face were shown across the TV screen and a video was shown of John being tortured.

“Good riddance!” Evan said to himself “That’s what he gets for not listening to me and going to Mexico instead. I hope your tax evasion scheme worked out well.”

A few more weeks went by when Evan was subject to the same old monotonous routine: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed.  

And so on and so on.
Evan started to hate the monotony of the routine he once loved. He realized just how boring life had become without someone to argue with like John. Evan then became so lonely without John or anyone else in his life that he found himself pacing around the floor at his lunch break talking to himself, and his coworkers started to get weirded out. 

“Sure, I might be bored and lonely, but am I going to risk life and limb just to save someone I love to hate?” Evan said to himself while he was pacing around the lunchroom floor.

“Evan, what the hell are you doing? You’ve been pacing around talking to yourself in public all lunch break? You seem lonely and you need a friend!” Rick, one of Evan’s coworkers, yelled at Evan while they were in the coffee break room at the nuclear power plant. 

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!” 

Rick's words rang in Evan’s ears over and over again.

“A friend eh?” Evan said to himself. “I think I know just where one is in Tijuana, Mexico who just so happens to need my help.”

Evan sprinted out the door toward the parking lot

“What are you doing this time!?” Rick asked

“Risking my life to save someone I hate for reasons I don’t quite understand. Gotta go!” 

Evan yelled back at Rick as he sprinted out the door. He ran over to the nearby train station where he booked a ticket to Tijuana.

“Time to fight a drug cartel and kick ass!” Evan whispered to himself as he boarded the train to Tijuana.

**Chapter 10 Evan frees John**

The train got off in Tijuana in a train station in a sketchy ally with city maps for both English and Spanish telling tourists where various attractions and shops are, and one of them was a gun shop, which would allow Evan to get his hand on a weapon so he could take down MS-13 and save John. 
“Why is a gun shop one of the primary tourist destinations listed on the map?” Evan thought to himself out loud

“Mexico has very loose gun laws unlike Canada and the US, so people from across the border in San Diego cross the border all the time just to get guns.” a tourist responded to Evan.

“Oh, you speak English?” Evan asked.

“Yeah, virtually everyone in Tijuana speaks both English and Spanish,” the tourist responded.

Evan then found a currency exchange station where he exchanged his Canadian dollars for Mexican pesos. Evan then walked a few blocks to the nearby gun shop where he purchased a gun and some ammo to take down MS-13 to save his friend. As soon as he started to wonder how he could find MS-13, he saw a guy with a large MS-13 tattoo and asked him if he could join MS-13 as a new member.

“That’s a talk between you and the leader. I will take you to him, but to join MS-13, you first must prove your loyalty to him.” The guy with the MS-13 tattoo explained. 

Evan followed him through a maze of complex allies, each one sketchier than the last, into an enormous run-down warehouse-looking building with a 10-foot pyramid structure in the center, and at the top of the pyramid was a golden chair with a fat man sitting in it.

“Why have you come to bother me?!” the fat man snapped.

“We have a new potential recruit to MS-13.” the guy with the MS-13 tattoo replied.

“Hmmmmm, that’s odd, we haven’t had a recruit in several years. Well, I guess we could always use more members.” the fat man said to himself “Your loyalty test to this organization will be that you are required to assassinate Tijuana city council member Luis Francheco and have his corpse brought to me. He is the primary member of the Tijuana city council who is trying to push corruption out of the Tijuana city government and we rely on that corruption so that we can continue to bribe the government officials so that they don’t arrest us. Do you understand?”

“Yes sir,” Evan replied. “Do you by chance happen to know where you guys keep your prisoners?” 

“That is confidential information that I can not tell you until you have brought Luis Francheso’s corpse to me.” The fat man replied.

“Understood.” Evan replied.

Evan walked out of the MS-13 layer and walked a few blocks until he saw an ally where he could buy some roofies. Evan then ran his next errand to a local grocery store where he purchased a big bottle of wine and a pen and a thank you card where he wrote “Thank you Mr. Franchesco for being the best city council member, we have a gift for you in the form of a bottle of wine.” Once Evan was out of the store, he opened the bottle of wine and opened the package of roofies and dumped the roofies into the wine bottle. Last but not least, Evan got on a bus and went to the outskirts of town where he saw a farm. He snuck onto that farm and slaughtered one of the pigs and emptied the blood from the pig’s carcass into the same jar he used to carry the battery acid during their escape from prison. Evan then rode the bus to city hall and went into Mr. Franchesco’s office and put the thank you card and the bottle of wine on his desk. Evan then heard Mr. Franchesco’s footsteps down the hallway approaching his room at the end of the hallway, so Evan hid in the closet in Mr. Franchesco’s office and peeped through the ventilation desk to see Mr. Francesco sit down in his office chair.

“Oh Boy!” Mr. Franchesco said to himself “Someone’s left a big bottle of wine and a thank you card for me. I normally don’t drink at work, but it’s 4 pm, so I guess we can make an exception here. Plus it’s been a long stressful day for me. “Juan, my assistant, can you take a sip of this wine for me please so that I don’t get poisoned?.. Oh, I forgot, he’s out sick today.”

Evan quietly breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing that Mr. Franchesco’s taster assistant was out sick today, and Mr. Francesco took a sip of the wine and instantly passed out. Evan then looked in the hallways to see that no one was coming, and he saw that no one was there, so Evan dragged Mr. Franchesco’s unconscious body out the door. Once he was out the door, Evan dumped the vile of pig blood all over Mr. Franchesco’s dead body to make it look like he killed him. Evan then used all of his strength to drag Mr. Franchesco’s body to the MS-13 lay and present it below the fat man who led MS-13. 

“Excellent work.” the fat man said to Evan. “You are officially now our newest member.”

“So where exactly does MS-13 keep their prisoners?”

“We keep them at 4-303 Bolivar Rd. When you get out of the warehouse, you make a right out of the driveway onto our street and go down it 6 blocks and then you make a left onto Bolivar Road. You will then go down 3 and a half more blocks and you will come across 4-303 bolivar road on your left. I am granting you this MS-13 badge. Just show the guards this badge and they will let you in. May I ask why do you want to go into our gang prison?” The fat man replied.

“Because there’s this guy in there named John who I am going to shoot with my pistol because he’s behind on his mortgage to me. I lent him a car, and he has now been behind on his monthly payments for 6 months in a row, so I’m going to show him why you don’t mess with me” Evan responded.
“Well, we hate John too. We only captured him in the hope that we could hold him ransom for the US government, and because they have refused to buy him from us, he’s essentially a useless prisoner who you are free to kill.” The fat man replied. 

John walked 6 blocks, turned left at Bolivar Road, walked 3 and a half blocks more, and found 4-303 Bolivar Road and opened the door to get in. Once he opened that door, there was a short hallway with a door at the end with two more guards who both had guns both pointed at Evan and announced.

“Halt! Please show us your ID and your purpose for the entry” 

“I have been sent here to kill prisoner John,” Evan announced. “The boss ordered for him to be killed because we were unable to sell him for ransom back to the US government. Here is my ID.” Evan showed him the badge

“Your entry is granted!” the guards stepped out of the way and withdrew their guns. “Here is the key to Evan’s cell.”

 Evan then walked through the maze of cells filled with prisoners who were beaten, bloodied, and battered, until he came across the one he was here for. He approached John’s cell and unlocked it.

“Evan?” John asked, with blood pouring out of wounds on his torso and arms

“Yes, it’s me, Evan,” Evan replied. “I’m here to set you free.”

Evan and John then both ran out of the prison, with Evan using his gun to shoot both of the prison guards in the knee and freeing John from the torture of the MS-13 prison. 

“I can't believe you risked your life to save me?!” John said as he hugged Evan and cried

“Shhhh!” Evan whispered loudly “We have to be quiet and remain out of sight. MS-13 could send out reinforcements anytime.

As John and Evan ran through the city of Tijuana towards the train station, they passed by this electronic store with an enormous glass window with multiple TVs in the store showing through the glass onto the streets where people could watch the TVs. One of those TVs in the electronics store showing on the street had the news on, and it showed that the President of the United States’s 13-year-old daughter had been kidnapped by a gang called the Tijuana Cartel and that the president was offering a reward of a million dollars to whoever could rescue the president’s daughter.

“Are you thinking what I am thinking?” John asked Evan
“That we could get a million dollars from saving the President’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel?” Evan replied.

“Better yet, we could get a presidential pardon for our crimes if we save the president’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel and get our criminal records expunged.” John replied

“Good idea.” Evan replied.

“Freeze” John and Evan both heard as five gunmen and a leader approached John and Evan at the electronics store with the TVs that showed out into the streets and were about to shoot them then and there. 

“Do you have any last words before MS-13 kills you?” The leader of the gunman asked.
 Evan pulled out his gun to try to shoot them in self-defense, but it was no use as Evan was out of ammo and at the mercy of the five MS-13 gunmen.

“Thanks for saving my life by rescuing me from the MS-13 prison. John said to Evan “Even if it only extended my life for five more minutes.”

“Be prepared to die!” the leader of the gunman said as the five gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at Evan and John, as they flinched, knowing that this would be the end. The five gunmen all had their fingers on the triggers about to shoot and end Evan and John’s life when suddenly the five gunmen and their leader all fell and had bullet-holes in their torsos with blood oozing out on the sidewalk at the Electronic store with the TVs pointing out to the streets. 

“Whoever you are, thank you for saving our lives.” Evan and John said.

“Call me Enedina, the leader of the Tijuana Cartel.” A woman stepped out of a shadowy ally with smoke coming out of her AR-15. “MS-13 has been one of our biggest rivals in the gang war, and your escape has certainly made headlines in the news of the criminal underworld, and for publicly slapping the face of our biggest rival, we want to make you the newest member of the Tijuana Cartel.

“Hold on, I need to have one moment alone with my associate,” Evan said

“Take your time,” Enedina said

“John, is this the same Tijuana Cartel that has kidnapped the President’s daughter?” Evan whispered to John.

“It sure is.” John replied, whispering to Evan. 

“Ok, so we will join and then free the president’s daughter.” Evan replied whispering to John.
“We will join the Tijuana Cartel with you.” Evan and John said to Enedina.

“It’s always good to have two new members,” Enedina replied.

**Chapter 11: a presidential pardon**

John and Evan were welcomed into the layer of the Tijuana Cartel, and they asked Enedina if they could have some more bandages for John’s wounds and ammo for Evan’s gun and Enedina happily provided those to them. 

“Enedina, would you know where we keep the Tijuana Cartel gang prisoners?” John asked

“We keep them at 3-506 Zaragoza Road. You have to first get a right out of the driveway and then go down the street for 4 blocks and make a left onto Zaragoza Road. You go down the road for about half a block and you will see 3-506 Zaragoza on your right. May I ask why you want to go down to where the prisoners are kept?” Enedina replied.

“We were looking to kill the President of the United State’s daughter. We have fed her for days, yet the president still shows no sign of paying her ransom or doing anything, so we have no other choice but to kill her as she means nothing to us now.” Evan replied.

“Yeah, you have a fair point. I see no reason why the president’s daughter needs to live. We’ve broadcasted her face all over the news for days and everyone knows that she has been kidnapped and if the president wanted to save her or pay her ransom, he would have easily done that by now. I permit you to go kill the president’s daughter in her jail cell. Here’s a Tijuana Cartel badge. Present this badge to the guards outside and they should let you into the President’s daughter’s cell. 

John and Evan took a right out of the driveway and walked 4 blocks, turned left, walked another half block, and came across 3-506 Zaragoza Road. They opened the door and then walked into a very short 5-foot-long hallway with another door at the end with two guards with guns both pointed at them.

“Halt!” The guards shouted “Show us your authorization and purpose for the entry.”

“We are with the Tijuana Cartel and we have been sent here to kill the President’s daughter, as we have held her for ransom for days, and yet the president has done nothing to save her or pay her ransom, so we have decided that the best use of resources is to simply kill her so we don’t waste our resources feeding her.” John stated.

“Here is our Tijuana Cartel badge handed to us by Enedina.” Evan stated.
 
“You are free to enter our prison, here’s the key to the president’s daughter’s cell.” The guards stated.

John and Evan walked through the Tijuana Cartel Prison with prisoners in every shade of orange, each one looking scarier than the last until they came across the sweet-looking face of the president’s 13-year-old daughter. John unlocked the key while Evan entered the cell and leaned into the president’s daughter’s ear and whispered that they were there to save her life.

“Yippie!” the President’s daughter shouted.

“Shhhhh!” Evan whispered loudly.

 Evan and the President’s daughter exited the cell and joined up with John who was outside of the cell. John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all walked swiftly but calmly towards the entrance they came in, as Evan got out his gun and shot the guards in the knees before they could suspect anything, meaning that John and Evan had now just freed the President’s daughter. The trio then started running away from the prison northward towards the US border.

“Next stop, to San Diego across the border,” Evan said panting while running. “I brought a makeshift grappling hook made of bicycle chains and a car hood that we can use to hop the Tortilla wall that separates Tijuana and San Diego.”

“Ugh, do we have to use one of those? Last time I used one of those I almost fell off of the prison . . . I mean a city wall.” John coughed and awkwardly corrected himself as he noticed the president’s 13-year-old daughter look at him as he slipped up and said he escaped from prison.

“Wait, you two are outlaws?” The president’s daughter asked John and Evan.

“*sigh* yes,” John and Evan said in unison as the trio all continued to pant in unison as they were running towards the border while talking.

“Awesome!” the president’s daughter squealed. “I've always wanted to meet an outlaw, but my dad won’t let me walk outside without secret service supervision and engage in any fun activities that kids my age do like spray painting and skateboarding.”

The trio continued to run and they were less than a block away from the Tortilla wall at the US-Mexico border when 6 men with guns all blocked the street in front of them and pointed their guns at the trio and said

“Freeze, we have orders to terminate you by the Tijuana Cartel!”

Evan once again reached for his pistol and tried to fire it, but it was jammed and unable to fire. John, Evan, and The President’s daughter all cowered there helplessly in fear and saw their entire life flash before their eyes, and time stood still, knowing that the gun of the Tijuana Cartel was about to end their very lives within the flash of a second.

“On my command fire,” Their leader shouted. 

The 6 gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at the trio, when all of a sudden, two attack helicopters with American flags came out of the air and shot all 6 gunmen, and all 6 fell with bullet holes in their torsos and blood oozing out on the sidewalk less than a block away from the Tortilla wall. After the two attack helicopters shot down the 6 gunmen, Airforce One descended onto the ground in front of the trio. The president opened the door to the plane and the stairs descended to the sidewalk where John, Evan, and the president’s daughter were all standing.

“Hop on in honey!” The president announced “Who are your two new friends”

“They just saved me from prison in the Tijuana Cartel by pretending to join the organization and then double-crossing them to save me.” The president’s daughter explained. “Can they come too?”

The president stood there for a long moment, seeing that these guys were sketchy and looked like convicts themselves, the president would normally let these types of guys into his plane, but considering that they had just saved his daughter, he reluctantly agreed to let them in. The trio climbed into Air Force One, and Airforce One took off towards Washington DC.

“Before I say anything else, I just want to say that I am incredibly sorry that I didn’t come and save you earlier and that you were captured for over a week.” The president went on. “You see when I first got to Tijuana to have a meeting with the President of Mexico, I received anonymous death threats, so I was ordered by my secret service to abandon my meeting in Mexico and to flee to an undisclosed location in Nevada that had no cell signal, broadband, or internet for my safety so I had no way of knowing that you were captured. Before I left Tijuana for the undisclosed place in Nevada, I decided that for your safety, it would be best for you to stay behind in Tijuana with my presidential aide named Edwin, as I knew that keeping you with me in New Mexico would put you in more danger as I am the one they are after not you. If I had known that Edwin was such a heavy sleeper and wouldn’t detect kidnappers breaking into the house in the middle of the night, I would have never assigned him to protect you and I would have assigned someone else to protect you instead. I only found out that you had been captured once the secret service traveled to my undisclosed place in Nevada by car and informed me that you had been captured.” The president explained.

“It doesn’t matter now.” The president’s daughter said “What matters is that you and I are safe and together” as they both hugged and embraced, as a tear fell on both of their cheeks
. 
“And you two” the president motioned towards Evan and John “What made you two risk your life to save my daughter.”
Evan told his story about how he is a far-left activist who was arrested for welfare fraud, befriended his assigned cellmate who was a far-right activist who was arrested for tax evasion, and how they worked together to Escape prison. Then Evan went on to describe how they both planned to flee the country and for Canada, but then John and Evan got into a fight when they got out of prison and John went to Mexico while Evan went to Canada, and Evan found out that John had been captured while watching the news, so Evan went down to Mexico to save his friend. While they were in Mexico, they both saw the news about how the President of the United States’s daughter had been kidnapped, and they both agreed to break her out to receive a presidential pardon for their crimes. 

“A welfare queen and a tax evader working together?! That’s odd.” The president responded. “If only I could get along with members on the opposite side of the aisle in Congress as you do.” The president chuckled.

“Would you grant us a pardon?” John asked, “We have been through hell and back just to get to here, and we saved your daughter from death and we promise that we won’t do it again after having been on the run from the law for several months which taught us our lesson.”

“Normally, I would say no, but because of your heroism in risking your life to save my daughter from death, I will agree to grant you a full presidential pardon for your crimes, but be warned however, this pardon does not protect you from future crimes that you commit, so you can’t abuse the welfare system anymore and you can’t evade taxes anymore.” The president said.

“We promise we’ll be good from now on!” John and Evan said.

“This might be a weird request for you guys, but how would you two like to work at an entry-level job in the FBI for me? Our FBI has currently been ineffective at catching criminals, and I think the reason why they are is that none of them are ex-criminals, meaning they know nothing about how a criminal thinks or behaves, so we were wondering if you would like to take on a job in the FBI hunting these guys down?”

“That sounds good!” John squealed.

“Having a steady job for once in my life would mean that I would no longer have to resort to a life of crime” Evan cheered. 

“Thank you, Mr. President!” John and Evan said.

“You’re welcome.” The president replied.

Air Force One had just touched down in Washington DC, and John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all decided that they would get motorcycles, matching switchblades, and matching tattoos that read “Kill all betrayers” (although the President’s daughter’s was a temporary tattoo, as she wasn’t old enough to get a real one.) The president then approached John, Evan, and the President’s daughter with their matching motorcycles, tattoos, and switchblades, looking at his daughter with disgust for her new punk lifestyle.

“Honey, would you like to come with your dad on a cool diplomatic trip in Wilmington Delaware? There would be lots of tall chairs for you to sit in.” The president bribed his daughter.

“No thanks. I’m tired of going on trips that involve people in itchy clothing bitching at each other. I’d rather hang out with my cool new friends John and Evan!” The president’s daughter replied as she mounted on her motorcycle, as John and Evan each mounted onto their own.

“Well, you three have fun while I’m gone!” The president shouted as the three of them raced away on their motorcycles. 

“Secret service, follow them at a distance!” The president whispered to his secret service agents who proceeded to get in their motorcycles and follow them at a distance.

I'm in tears right now because I'm losing my mom, or at least who she was. We've been extremely close since I was little. She always had my back throughout my life, and I'm trying to return the favor. But I feel like I'm failing. Like I'm a terrible son because I'm not handling this well...

My sister is working on bringing in a caregiver at least part time, which will help. Though I'm scared that the time is coming where she won't even remember me anymore. Thanks for listening, I'm not good at talking about all this, and don't really have someone who understands how hard this is for me. My sister hides her emotions and is not empathetic, so I can't count on her for support. Not sure what else to say. It's late and I need to sleep. :(",5,1742186029.0,dementia,2,0.86,False

For days on end, John and Evan looked outside their prison cell window and waited and waited for a day with thunderstorms. Eventually, a thunderstorm came at 1:30 AM with lightning crashing down from the heavens onto Earth.

“I’ve got the 20-foot lightning rod made of antennas.” Evan said.

“I’ve got the jar of battery acid and the bicycle chains that are attached to car hood hooks as grappling hooks.” John said.

Evan looked down the hallway to see if there were any guards around, and there were no guards in their area.

“Coast is clear!” Evan loudly whispered to John.

Evan and John tiptoed towards the electrical closet room and Evan stuck the lightning rod made of antennas up through a small crack in the ceiling into the sky where rain came pouring down. John then wired that lightning rod into the central electrical control panel.

“Now we just have to wait for it to be struck by lightning so that the prison’s power goes out and we can hop over the electric fence.” Evan said.

Two hours later, John and Evan saw a lightning bolt come through the small crack in the ceiling traveling down the lightning rod made of antennas and into the central electrical control panel, shorting it out. All of the lights in the prison went dark, and they realized that they successfully shorted out the power in the prison.

“Hurry, power-walk this way towards the prison yard. Don’t run or you’ll draw attention to yourself and the guards will notice you. If someone notices us and tries to catch us, then switch from power-walking to running.” John instructed Evan.

John and Evan powerwalked about 500 feet from the electrical closet to the backdoor past a few security guards who were all asleep, which makes sense considering that it was 3:30 in the morning.

John and Evan walked through the empty prison yard lit by the moon to the first wall.

“We’ll both take turns using my grappling hook first to get past this first wall with the electric fence, and we’ll take turns using your grappling hook to get past the second with the barbed wire.” Evan directed John. 

“Really, why can’t each of us just use one grappling hook for both walls?” John asked.

“Because these grappling hooks are single-use because once you’ve used them to ascend and descend the walls, you would have to re-ascend the walls so you could retrieve the grappling hooks, and then jump off the wall to unhook it and retrieve it. This would be both time-consuming and dangerous because if you jump off of the walls incorrectly, you could break a bone.” Evan explained.

“Well shit, I guess you’re right,” John replied
Evan held onto the end of the bicycle chain that was not attached to the car hood hooks, and threw the bicycle chain into the air, causing the end attached to the car hood hooks to latch onto the top of the electric fence that was shorted out due to the power outage. Evan went first, climbing up the bicycle chain with all of his might. He almost slipped, but he made it up to the top.

“Now it’s your turn to climb up. Once we're both at the top, I will start climbing down, as neither of us can climb down until both of us have climbed up.” Evan explained

“And why is that?” John asked

“Because someone has to re-adjust the grappling hook for us to start lowering ourselves on the other side of this wall in a safe manner, and if I have already lowered myself by the time you start climbing up, then no one will be at the top to re-adjust the grappling hook.” Evan replied.

“Fair point.” John replied.

John, who was much stronger than Evan, used his strength to propel himself up the bicycle chain. The chain almost broke under John’s weight, but John made it to the top successfully. Once John and Evan both were at the top of the wall, Evan re-adjusted the grappling hook position so that it pointed down the other side of the wall, allowing Evan and John to descend the wall on the other side. Evan climbed down first, then John. 

“One wall down, one wall to go,” John said

“With this 2nd wall with the barbed wires, we will treat it exactly like the first but because of the barbed wires, I will pour this battery acid on it, which will make that part of the barbed wire deteriorate which will allow us to go through the barbed wire and escape,” Evan explained
John grabbed his bicycle chain on the end that was not attached to the car hood hook and threw the other end into the air, as it latched onto the top of the 2nd wall with the barbed wire. Evan then grabbed the jar filled with battery acid and shoved it into his back pocket and climbed up the bicycle chain to the top of the wall with the barbed wire. Evan got out the jar and poured the battery acid onto the barbed wire, which caused it to melt, creating a clear passageway for John and Evan. John then climbed up the chain with Evan. Evan then re-adjusted the chain for it to go down the other side of the wall and slowly descended it to the other side, finally making his way to the outside of the prison into freedom. John followed Evan down the chain and was now also on the outside of the prison. As the sun started to rise, Evan and John heard sirens activating in the prison, meaning that they knew they had fixed the damaged power system and that they knew that Evan and John had escaped.

“First things first, we will be too recognizable in our orange uniforms. There’s a dumpster filled with all kinds of clothes with only tiny holes in them in the garbage behind the clothing store over there. Let’s get some new clothes so we don’t get caught.” John said. 
Evan and John both went into the dumpster and got themselves new clothes with a few holes in them and threw out their old prison uniforms so that they would not get caught.

“Look over there!” John said “There's a boxcar with a homeless person riding in it. Maybe we can ride in it to get away from this prison so that we don’t get caught.” John said.

“Good idea,” Evan replied.

Evan and John ran towards the boxcar train with a homeless man on it and hopped on. As soon as they hopped on, the homeless man said 

“Looks like this is my stop.”And hopped off. 

The boxcar train whisked Evan and John hundreds of miles away.

**Chapter 8: The Breakup**

The boxcar train that was carrying John and Evan was now hundreds of miles away west of the prison in an abandoned wilderness.

“Ok, so now that we have escaped prison, what will we do next?” Evan asked.

“We’ll probably flee to Mexico where the tax laws are very loosely enforced and we can get away with not paying taxes and not going to prison.” John replied.

“But I don’t want to go to Mexico, I want to go to Canada where there is an enormous welfare state and I can easily get away with welfare fraud and not go to prison,” Evan complained. 

“Well, I’m sure as hell not going to Canada where I’d be forced to spend all of my hard-earned tax dollars on lazy bums like you!” John yelled.

“Did you just call me a lazy bum?!” Evan snapped back as he grabbed John’s shoulder.

“That’s exactly what you are, a lazy bum!” John snapped as he threw Evan to the floor inside the boxcar train. “You’ve never worked a day in your life and all you ever do is leech off of hard-working taxpayers like me to pay for your luxurious lifestyle while I get none of the luxuries you can get. That’s exactly why I stopped paying taxes 20 years ago!”

“Fine, I’m going to Canada by myself.” Evan declared.

“I’m going to Mexico by myself.” John declared.

The boxcar train then stopped at Millennium Park Station in Chicago with networks of trains and train tracks going every which way. John and Evan both parted ways, as John snuck onto the back of a train going south to Mexico, while Evan snuck onto the back of a train going north to Canada. 

**Chapter 9: Monotony**

Once Evan rode that train from Chicago to Toronto he got a job as a safety inspector at a nuclear power plant and bought a cheap apartment downtown. The next few weeks were a steady routine for Evan: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed:

and so on. 

Evan loved having a steady routine for once, as this was something he had never had before as a criminal who was always running from the law. In Canada, he got a steady job and never resorted to welfare fraud. One day Evan was watching the news when he heard a disturbing report.

“This just in, a man named John was kidnapped and brutally beaten by the infamous gang MS-13” John’s full name and face were shown across the TV screen and a video was shown of John being tortured.

“Good riddance!” Evan said to himself “That’s what he gets for not listening to me and going to Mexico instead. I hope your tax evasion scheme worked out well.”

A few more weeks went by when Evan was subject to the same old monotonous routine: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed.  

And so on and so on.
Evan started to hate the monotony of the routine he once loved. He realized just how boring life had become without someone to argue with like John. Evan then became so lonely without John or anyone else in his life that he found himself pacing around the floor at his lunch break talking to himself, and his coworkers started to get weirded out. 

“Sure, I might be bored and lonely, but am I going to risk life and limb just to save someone I love to hate?” Evan said to himself while he was pacing around the lunchroom floor.

“Evan, what the hell are you doing? You’ve been pacing around talking to yourself in public all lunch break? You seem lonely and you need a friend!” Rick, one of Evan’s coworkers, yelled at Evan while they were in the coffee break room at the nuclear power plant. 

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!” 

Rick's words rang in Evan’s ears over and over again.

“A friend eh?” Evan said to himself. “I think I know just where one is in Tijuana, Mexico who just so happens to need my help.”

Evan sprinted out the door toward the parking lot

“What are you doing this time!?” Rick asked

“Risking my life to save someone I hate for reasons I don’t quite understand. Gotta go!” 

Evan yelled back at Rick as he sprinted out the door. He ran over to the nearby train station where he booked a ticket to Tijuana.

“Time to fight a drug cartel and kick ass!” Evan whispered to himself as he boarded the train to Tijuana.

**Chapter 10 Evan frees John**

The train got off in Tijuana in a train station in a sketchy ally with city maps for both English and Spanish telling tourists where various attractions and shops are, and one of them was a gun shop, which would allow Evan to get his hand on a weapon so he could take down MS-13 and save John. 
“Why is a gun shop one of the primary tourist destinations listed on the map?” Evan thought to himself out loud

“Mexico has very loose gun laws unlike Canada and the US, so people from across the border in San Diego cross the border all the time just to get guns.” a tourist responded to Evan.

“Oh, you speak English?” Evan asked.

“Yeah, virtually everyone in Tijuana speaks both English and Spanish,” the tourist responded.

Evan then found a currency exchange station where he exchanged his Canadian dollars for Mexican pesos. Evan then walked a few blocks to the nearby gun shop where he purchased a gun and some ammo to take down MS-13 to save his friend. As soon as he started to wonder how he could find MS-13, he saw a guy with a large MS-13 tattoo and asked him if he could join MS-13 as a new member.

“That’s a talk between you and the leader. I will take you to him, but to join MS-13, you first must prove your loyalty to him.” The guy with the MS-13 tattoo explained. 

Evan followed him through a maze of complex allies, each one sketchier than the last, into an enormous run-down warehouse-looking building with a 10-foot pyramid structure in the center, and at the top of the pyramid was a golden chair with a fat man sitting in it.

“Why have you come to bother me?!” the fat man snapped.

“We have a new potential recruit to MS-13.” the guy with the MS-13 tattoo replied.

“Hmmmmm, that’s odd, we haven’t had a recruit in several years. Well, I guess we could always use more members.” the fat man said to himself “Your loyalty test to this organization will be that you are required to assassinate Tijuana city council member Luis Francheco and have his corpse brought to me. He is the primary member of the Tijuana city council who is trying to push corruption out of the Tijuana city government and we rely on that corruption so that we can continue to bribe the government officials so that they don’t arrest us. Do you understand?”

“Yes sir,” Evan replied. “Do you by chance happen to know where you guys keep your prisoners?” 

“That is confidential information that I can not tell you until you have brought Luis Francheso’s corpse to me.” The fat man replied.

“Understood.” Evan replied.

Evan walked out of the MS-13 layer and walked a few blocks until he saw an ally where he could buy some roofies. Evan then ran his next errand to a local grocery store where he purchased a big bottle of wine and a pen and a thank you card where he wrote “Thank you Mr. Franchesco for being the best city council member, we have a gift for you in the form of a bottle of wine.” Once Evan was out of the store, he opened the bottle of wine and opened the package of roofies and dumped the roofies into the wine bottle. Last but not least, Evan got on a bus and went to the outskirts of town where he saw a farm. He snuck onto that farm and slaughtered one of the pigs and emptied the blood from the pig’s carcass into the same jar he used to carry the battery acid during their escape from prison. Evan then rode the bus to city hall and went into Mr. Franchesco’s office and put the thank you card and the bottle of wine on his desk. Evan then heard Mr. Franchesco’s footsteps down the hallway approaching his room at the end of the hallway, so Evan hid in the closet in Mr. Franchesco’s office and peeped through the ventilation desk to see Mr. Francesco sit down in his office chair.

“Oh Boy!” Mr. Franchesco said to himself “Someone’s left a big bottle of wine and a thank you card for me. I normally don’t drink at work, but it’s 4 pm, so I guess we can make an exception here. Plus it’s been a long stressful day for me. “Juan, my assistant, can you take a sip of this wine for me please so that I don’t get poisoned?.. Oh, I forgot, he’s out sick today.”

Evan quietly breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing that Mr. Franchesco’s taster assistant was out sick today, and Mr. Francesco took a sip of the wine and instantly passed out. Evan then looked in the hallways to see that no one was coming, and he saw that no one was there, so Evan dragged Mr. Franchesco’s unconscious body out the door. Once he was out the door, Evan dumped the vile of pig blood all over Mr. Franchesco’s dead body to make it look like he killed him. Evan then used all of his strength to drag Mr. Franchesco’s body to the MS-13 lay and present it below the fat man who led MS-13. 

“Excellent work.” the fat man said to Evan. “You are officially now our newest member.”

“So where exactly does MS-13 keep their prisoners?”

“We keep them at 4-303 Bolivar Rd. When you get out of the warehouse, you make a right out of the driveway onto our street and go down it 6 blocks and then you make a left onto Bolivar Road. You will then go down 3 and a half more blocks and you will come across 4-303 bolivar road on your left. I am granting you this MS-13 badge. Just show the guards this badge and they will let you in. May I ask why do you want to go into our gang prison?” The fat man replied.

“Because there’s this guy in there named John who I am going to shoot with my pistol because he’s behind on his mortgage to me. I lent him a car, and he has now been behind on his monthly payments for 6 months in a row, so I’m going to show him why you don’t mess with me” Evan responded.
“Well, we hate John too. We only captured him in the hope that we could hold him ransom for the US government, and because they have refused to buy him from us, he’s essentially a useless prisoner who you are free to kill.” The fat man replied. 

John walked 6 blocks, turned left at Bolivar Road, walked 3 and a half blocks more, and found 4-303 Bolivar Road and opened the door to get in. Once he opened that door, there was a short hallway with a door at the end with two more guards who both had guns both pointed at Evan and announced.

“Halt! Please show us your ID and your purpose for the entry” 

“I have been sent here to kill prisoner John,” Evan announced. “The boss ordered for him to be killed because we were unable to sell him for ransom back to the US government. Here is my ID.” Evan showed him the badge

“Your entry is granted!” the guards stepped out of the way and withdrew their guns. “Here is the key to Evan’s cell.”

 Evan then walked through the maze of cells filled with prisoners who were beaten, bloodied, and battered, until he came across the one he was here for. He approached John’s cell and unlocked it.

“Evan?” John asked, with blood pouring out of wounds on his torso and arms

“Yes, it’s me, Evan,” Evan replied. “I’m here to set you free.”

Evan and John then both ran out of the prison, with Evan using his gun to shoot both of the prison guards in the knee and freeing John from the torture of the MS-13 prison. 

“I can't believe you risked your life to save me?!” John said as he hugged Evan and cried

“Shhhh!” Evan whispered loudly “We have to be quiet and remain out of sight. MS-13 could send out reinforcements anytime.

As John and Evan ran through the city of Tijuana towards the train station, they passed by this electronic store with an enormous glass window with multiple TVs in the store showing through the glass onto the streets where people could watch the TVs. One of those TVs in the electronics store showing on the street had the news on, and it showed that the President of the United States’s 13-year-old daughter had been kidnapped by a gang called the Tijuana Cartel and that the president was offering a reward of a million dollars to whoever could rescue the president’s daughter.

“Are you thinking what I am thinking?” John asked Evan
“That we could get a million dollars from saving the President’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel?” Evan replied.

“Better yet, we could get a presidential pardon for our crimes if we save the president’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel and get our criminal records expunged.” John replied

“Good idea.” Evan replied.

“Freeze” John and Evan both heard as five gunmen and a leader approached John and Evan at the electronics store with the TVs that showed out into the streets and were about to shoot them then and there. 

“Do you have any last words before MS-13 kills you?” The leader of the gunman asked.
 Evan pulled out his gun to try to shoot them in self-defense, but it was no use as Evan was out of ammo and at the mercy of the five MS-13 gunmen.

“Thanks for saving my life by rescuing me from the MS-13 prison. John said to Evan “Even if it only extended my life for five more minutes.”

“Be prepared to die!” the leader of the gunman said as the five gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at Evan and John, as they flinched, knowing that this would be the end. The five gunmen all had their fingers on the triggers about to shoot and end Evan and John’s life when suddenly the five gunmen and their leader all fell and had bullet-holes in their torsos with blood oozing out on the sidewalk at the Electronic store with the TVs pointing out to the streets. 

“Whoever you are, thank you for saving our lives.” Evan and John said.

“Call me Enedina, the leader of the Tijuana Cartel.” A woman stepped out of a shadowy ally with smoke coming out of her AR-15. “MS-13 has been one of our biggest rivals in the gang war, and your escape has certainly made headlines in the news of the criminal underworld, and for publicly slapping the face of our biggest rival, we want to make you the newest member of the Tijuana Cartel.

“Hold on, I need to have one moment alone with my associate,” Evan said

“Take your time,” Enedina said

“John, is this the same Tijuana Cartel that has kidnapped the President’s daughter?” Evan whispered to John.

“It sure is.” John replied, whispering to Evan. 

“Ok, so we will join and then free the president’s daughter.” Evan replied whispering to John.
“We will join the Tijuana Cartel with you.” Evan and John said to Enedina.

“It’s always good to have two new members,” Enedina replied.

**Chapter 11: a presidential pardon**

John and Evan were welcomed into the layer of the Tijuana Cartel, and they asked Enedina if they could have some more bandages for John’s wounds and ammo for Evan’s gun and Enedina happily provided those to them. 

“Enedina, would you know where we keep the Tijuana Cartel gang prisoners?” John asked

“We keep them at 3-506 Zaragoza Road. You have to first get a right out of the driveway and then go down the street for 4 blocks and make a left onto Zaragoza Road. You go down the road for about half a block and you will see 3-506 Zaragoza on your right. May I ask why you want to go down to where the prisoners are kept?” Enedina replied.

“We were looking to kill the President of the United State’s daughter. We have fed her for days, yet the president still shows no sign of paying her ransom or doing anything, so we have no other choice but to kill her as she means nothing to us now.” Evan replied.

“Yeah, you have a fair point. I see no reason why the president’s daughter needs to live. We’ve broadcasted her face all over the news for days and everyone knows that she has been kidnapped and if the president wanted to save her or pay her ransom, he would have easily done that by now. I permit you to go kill the president’s daughter in her jail cell. Here’s a Tijuana Cartel badge. Present this badge to the guards outside and they should let you into the President’s daughter’s cell. 

John and Evan took a right out of the driveway and walked 4 blocks, turned left, walked another half block, and came across 3-506 Zaragoza Road. They opened the door and then walked into a very short 5-foot-long hallway with another door at the end with two guards with guns both pointed at them.

“Halt!” The guards shouted “Show us your authorization and purpose for the entry.”

“We are with the Tijuana Cartel and we have been sent here to kill the President’s daughter, as we have held her for ransom for days, and yet the president has done nothing to save her or pay her ransom, so we have decided that the best use of resources is to simply kill her so we don’t waste our resources feeding her.” John stated.

“Here is our Tijuana Cartel badge handed to us by Enedina.” Evan stated.
 
“You are free to enter our prison, here’s the key to the president’s daughter’s cell.” The guards stated.

John and Evan walked through the Tijuana Cartel Prison with prisoners in every shade of orange, each one looking scarier than the last until they came across the sweet-looking face of the president’s 13-year-old daughter. John unlocked the key while Evan entered the cell and leaned into the president’s daughter’s ear and whispered that they were there to save her life.

“Yippie!” the President’s daughter shouted.

“Shhhhh!” Evan whispered loudly.

 Evan and the President’s daughter exited the cell and joined up with John who was outside of the cell. John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all walked swiftly but calmly towards the entrance they came in, as Evan got out his gun and shot the guards in the knees before they could suspect anything, meaning that John and Evan had now just freed the President’s daughter. The trio then started running away from the prison northward towards the US border.

“Next stop, to San Diego across the border,” Evan said panting while running. “I brought a makeshift grappling hook made of bicycle chains and a car hood that we can use to hop the Tortilla wall that separates Tijuana and San Diego.”

“Ugh, do we have to use one of those? Last time I used one of those I almost fell off of the prison . . . I mean a city wall.” John coughed and awkwardly corrected himself as he noticed the president’s 13-year-old daughter look at him as he slipped up and said he escaped from prison.

“Wait, you two are outlaws?” The president’s daughter asked John and Evan.

“*sigh* yes,” John and Evan said in unison as the trio all continued to pant in unison as they were running towards the border while talking.

“Awesome!” the president’s daughter squealed. “I've always wanted to meet an outlaw, but my dad won’t let me walk outside without secret service supervision and engage in any fun activities that kids my age do like spray painting and skateboarding.”

The trio continued to run and they were less than a block away from the Tortilla wall at the US-Mexico border when 6 men with guns all blocked the street in front of them and pointed their guns at the trio and said

“Freeze, we have orders to terminate you by the Tijuana Cartel!”

Evan once again reached for his pistol and tried to fire it, but it was jammed and unable to fire. John, Evan, and The President’s daughter all cowered there helplessly in fear and saw their entire life flash before their eyes, and time stood still, knowing that the gun of the Tijuana Cartel was about to end their very lives within the flash of a second.

“On my command fire,” Their leader shouted. 

The 6 gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at the trio, when all of a sudden, two attack helicopters with American flags came out of the air and shot all 6 gunmen, and all 6 fell with bullet holes in their torsos and blood oozing out on the sidewalk less than a block away from the Tortilla wall. After the two attack helicopters shot down the 6 gunmen, Airforce One descended onto the ground in front of the trio. The president opened the door to the plane and the stairs descended to the sidewalk where John, Evan, and the president’s daughter were all standing.

“Hop on in honey!” The president announced “Who are your two new friends”

“They just saved me from prison in the Tijuana Cartel by pretending to join the organization and then double-crossing them to save me.” The president’s daughter explained. “Can they come too?”

The president stood there for a long moment, seeing that these guys were sketchy and looked like convicts themselves, the president would normally let these types of guys into his plane, but considering that they had just saved his daughter, he reluctantly agreed to let them in. The trio climbed into Air Force One, and Airforce One took off towards Washington DC.

“Before I say anything else, I just want to say that I am incredibly sorry that I didn’t come and save you earlier and that you were captured for over a week.” The president went on. “You see when I first got to Tijuana to have a meeting with the President of Mexico, I received anonymous death threats, so I was ordered by my secret service to abandon my meeting in Mexico and to flee to an undisclosed location in Nevada that had no cell signal, broadband, or internet for my safety so I had no way of knowing that you were captured. Before I left Tijuana for the undisclosed place in Nevada, I decided that for your safety, it would be best for you to stay behind in Tijuana with my presidential aide named Edwin, as I knew that keeping you with me in New Mexico would put you in more danger as I am the one they are after not you. If I had known that Edwin was such a heavy sleeper and wouldn’t detect kidnappers breaking into the house in the middle of the night, I would have never assigned him to protect you and I would have assigned someone else to protect you instead. I only found out that you had been captured once the secret service traveled to my undisclosed place in Nevada by car and informed me that you had been captured.” The president explained.

“It doesn’t matter now.” The president’s daughter said “What matters is that you and I are safe and together” as they both hugged and embraced, as a tear fell on both of their cheeks
. 
“And you two” the president motioned towards Evan and John “What made you two risk your life to save my daughter.”
Evan told his story about how he is a far-left activist who was arrested for welfare fraud, befriended his assigned cellmate who was a far-right activist who was arrested for tax evasion, and how they worked together to Escape prison. Then Evan went on to describe how they both planned to flee the country and for Canada, but then John and Evan got into a fight when they got out of prison and John went to Mexico while Evan went to Canada, and Evan found out that John had been captured while watching the news, so Evan went down to Mexico to save his friend. While they were in Mexico, they both saw the news about how the President of the United States’s daughter had been kidnapped, and they both agreed to break her out to receive a presidential pardon for their crimes. 

“A welfare queen and a tax evader working together?! That’s odd.” The president responded. “If only I could get along with members on the opposite side of the aisle in Congress as you do.” The president chuckled.

“Would you grant us a pardon?” John asked, “We have been through hell and back just to get to here, and we saved your daughter from death and we promise that we won’t do it again after having been on the run from the law for several months which taught us our lesson.”

“Normally, I would say no, but because of your heroism in risking your life to save my daughter from death, I will agree to grant you a full presidential pardon for your crimes, but be warned however, this pardon does not protect you from future crimes that you commit, so you can’t abuse the welfare system anymore and you can’t evade taxes anymore.” The president said.

“We promise we’ll be good from now on!” John and Evan said.

“This might be a weird request for you guys, but how would you two like to work at an entry-level job in the FBI for me? Our FBI has currently been ineffective at catching criminals, and I think the reason why they are is that none of them are ex-criminals, meaning they know nothing about how a criminal thinks or behaves, so we were wondering if you would like to take on a job in the FBI hunting these guys down?”

“That sounds good!” John squealed.

“Having a steady job for once in my life would mean that I would no longer have to resort to a life of crime” Evan cheered. 

“Thank you, Mr. President!” John and Evan said.

“You’re welcome.” The president replied.

Air Force One had just touched down in Washington DC, and John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all decided that they would get motorcycles, matching switchblades, and matching tattoos that read “Kill all betrayers” (although the President’s daughter’s was a temporary tattoo, as she wasn’t old enough to get a real one.) The president then approached John, Evan, and the President’s daughter with their matching motorcycles, tattoos, and switchblades, looking at his daughter with disgust for her new punk lifestyle.

“Honey, would you like to come with your dad on a cool diplomatic trip in Wilmington Delaware? There would be lots of tall chairs for you to sit in.” The president bribed his daughter.

“No thanks. I’m tired of going on trips that involve people in itchy clothing bitching at each other. I’d rather hang out with my cool new friends John and Evan!” The president’s daughter replied as she mounted on her motorcycle, as John and Evan each mounted onto their own.

“Well, you three have fun while I’m gone!” The president shouted as the three of them raced away on their motorcycles.

I (32M) have been dating my girlfriend “Lila” (29F) for six months. I’m a catch—good job (senior sales rep, six figures), decent looks (I work out), and I’ve got a sharp sense of humor. Lila’s great too—cute, sweet, works as a teacher—but let’s be real, I’m the prize here. She’s told me herself she’s never dated anyone like me before.

Last weekend, we had plans for a nice dinner. I’d booked a spot at this upscale place she’s been dying to try. But Friday night, my buddy “Mark” hit me up—his company was throwing a last-minute rooftop party with free drinks and some big clients I’ve been trying to network with. I couldn’t say no—opportunities like that don’t just fall in your lap. So I texted Lila, “Hey, something came up, rain check on dinner?” She replied, “Oh… okay, hope it’s fun,” with a sad emoji. I figured she’d get over it.

The party was epic—closed a deal, got some numbers, felt like a king. I got home late, and Lila was already asleep on the couch (she has a key). Saturday morning, she was quiet, picking at her coffee. I asked what was wrong, and she said she’d been looking forward to our date all week, especially since I’d been busy lately. She wasn’t yelling, just mopey, which honestly annoyed me more.

Here’s where it went down: I told her, “Look, I get it, you’re disappointed, but I had to take this chance. You should be happy I’m killing it—most girls would kill to date a guy like me.” She stared at me, then said, “I don’t feel lucky right now, I feel like an afterthought.” I laughed—couldn’t help it—and said, “Come on, Lila, don’t be dramatic. You’re with me, that’s more than most get.” She grabbed her stuff and left without a word.

Now she’s barely texting back, and my sister (who’s Team Lila) says I sound like “a narcissistic ass.” I think Lila’s overreacting—I didn’t cheat or lie, I just prioritized something important. I’m out here building a future she’ll benefit from too. AITA for being honest about my value?

He promised me he would spend the next day with me . So he had some essential work at a store so took me w him on call on the way . I got him coffee and a snack ( paid for it ) too as a sweet gesture. Like I wasn’t on call the whole time but in between when he was travelling . So when he was in the coffee shop eating at around 4:30 pm it was decided that he’ll come back to his room and we will spend time together as he wasn’t there with me yesterday. 
His battery was running low so he asked me to cut the call and he would directly call me on reaching home ( his house is minutes away from the coffee shop ) . 
As usual I was waiting but a text came through that he would again go to this friends house as apparently 2 other guys were even coming and they would play fifa again . I was so sad bcz it was my time to spend with him . And I tried explaining that to him . But he just said stop it or I’ll block . I feel so sad . I just wanted him to spend time with me too .

Got a Pixel 9 a month and a bit ago. Noticed in the first week that the Bluetooth was absolutely horrendous (<3m range), and the phone bezel isn't attached to the body. I logged faults with Google, then spent 2 hours doing troubleshooting and getting logs for them - after which they said ""Oh yeah, we know about that and have no solution currently"".

Attempted to take it back to my local store for an exchange, and was told I would have to wait an hour for an appointment. I waited the hour, was told it would be another hour. I waited the second hour, and was told it wouldn't be any longer than 30 minutes. 30 minutes passed, and I was told that it would be at least another 3 hours to see anybody. No staff offered any follow up or attempt to help. Saw at least a dozen different people talking to sales staff in the time I was there who were able to walk straight in and talk to somebody if they wanted to spend money.

I left, and put in a negative review. I was contacted by a Telstra representative and asked to call to book an appointment so they could sort it out. I called, was told that they couldn't book any appointments over the phone and would have to do it through the app. I went to book an appointment through my phone, and there were zero available at the store for 3 weeks.

Telstra then suggested I go to another store about a 20 minute drive away as I could only get help if I was in a store. Did the drive, was told there was zero people at the store that could help, no managers around and any appointment I could book would be at least two weeks for anything that wasn't during work hours. There were 4 staff members there who were sitting around drinking coffee, and when I asked if any of them could help I was told they were ""booked out"".

Since then, the phone has gotten progressively worse (phantom touches on the touchscreen, random black dots that have appeared, an entire area of the screen that's now black) - and there are still no appointments I can make outside of work hours at any Telstra store within half an hour of me.

Is there ANYTHING I can do outside of taking time off of work or wasting hours waiting in a store to see somebody except for lodging a complaint with the TIO? I am on the south side of Brisbane fwiw.",1,1742185355.0,TelstraAustralia,8,0.67,False

1jd4fpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jd4fpb/problematic_friend/,Problematic friend?,"I'm part of a friend grupo of four, we’ve been friends for about 9/10 years (from secondary school), honestly they are (to me) my closest and best fiends. One of the girls in the group has been causing some issues lately and I don’t now how to still make sense of or group friendship anymore. 
The friend group formed mainly because we weren’t very social and were somewhat excluded form our class group in class so we would always be together. Now we are all in university studying different this me and two of the other girls go to the same faculty (not sure how to say this in English) but are all from different mayors/departments this third friend (A) goes to a different faculty (somewhat relevant information), she is about to graduate having only one class left. 
For the past year or so I’ve been feeling like the group is almost on its last leg I don’t think we are compatible friends anymore I haven’t said this to the rest because I don’t have concrete reason is just a feeling.
Now onto the problem with A, she has a tendency to make insensitive or problematic remarks not just about other people, but to us as well. Things like going to our friends house and going “omg your house is soo small hehe” or making weird implications/questions about our friends illness. To be honest in the moment all of this comments make me raise an eyebrow and from time to time I shut them down because frankly im a bit of a serious person so im not super good at taking shitty things as “just jokes” but A doesn’t really make this comments towards me, she has a wired respect to me that does not hold for the other two friends, this is why I try to shut down her comments by their laughing at them for being wildly ridiculous or ignorant or just outright questioning her on the logic she used to reach whatever she said. I think for all of this reasons I don’t recall super specific moments but I do know she can be really shitty at times. 
But for the past six month I have felt that the amount of time we have discuss/ talked about this behaviour increased a lot, im not sure I like that I don’t like to talk badly behind my friend back to my other finds at that. I can understand discussing/venting about this behaviour, but maybe making a plan for thing to improve like how to confront or even may how to pull out of the friendship. But it just feels like we are criticizing her to no end and then meeting up for coffee and encouraging her to be the best she can be, and then we get the “I love hanging out with you/ I love you guys” and its not right to me it feels really weird also because I don’t leave or hangouts feeling like that, when she is there I dread them a bit. I talked with one of my friends form the group and she agrees, she says we are just going to hang out less often.
I guess that its the real solution to all of this my thing is I don’t really know why still be friends with her (A) and what I really don’t get is A, why does she love hanging out with us to then be really bitchy to us and to get somewhat mistreated by me (im not the nicest person and can be really tactless when shutting her down, specially because it annoys me to no end when people are not nice to people I like and the they say just absolutely ignorant shit knowing full well nobody in the table is going to agree with them). Yeah I have some issues with A when we were in school I didn’t really like her and now as time goes on it becomes harder to justify our friendship. 
I don’t know if anybody has any advice about how to deal with people like her and honestly what to do, should we confront her and have a full-blown friendship break-up or more of a “we just fell out of touch but nothing really happened”, also I think I needed to vent a little. Oh! And you have any type of insight into this time of behaviour from A I would really appreciated i don’t understand her and it bothers me not being able to, I feel like it would help me deal with her if I could understand her behaviour a little better.

My firstborn had hoooooorrible sleep the first year but he was a great napper during the day and I was able to nap a lot with him. Around a year old, he finally slept through the night and then I got pregnant again. 
With my two month old, it’s been a LOT. He is fully breastfed (firstborn was too). He co-sleeps with me. After the sleepy 2-3 weeks where he slept a lot, it has been a great challenge. Now that he has longer wake windows, he just wants to be entertained a lot. He’s so darn cute but he needs to be on me/entertained thoroughly. Or else he just wails. I can only baby wear so much! 
But also, getting him to nap is such a challenge. Tried everything. Swaddling. Two different swings. Nursing to sleep. Mobile in a mini crib with light music. Sound machine. All of it. Just hates taking long naps or going down. When my toddler goes down, I can’t get a nap since I’m on call with the baby. I’m also up multiple times through the night. Some nights are better than others but very sleep deprived. My husband can’t help with anything during since I’m fully breastfeeding. We tried several bottles with either breast milk or formula and he hates it! Just WAILS and wants no part of it. He’s a chunky boy being 89 percentile for weight so feeding is not an issue. 
I have full access to taking cara babies and it’s not working for him. 
I guess what I’m trying to ask is, I’m two months in and BARELY surviving. Honestly most days I feel sick from being so sleep deprived. All while being “on” for my toddler. Literally takes every fiber in my being to hold everything together - do the very basics. 
I’m on a very healthy diet (I mill my own flour, low sugar, lots of protein, meat, eggs from our chickens, etc to give you an idea that’s 90% organic). I’m also extremely consistent with all my prenatals, iron supplements and vitamin D etc. coffee is basically a moral support drink and does nothing for me. It’s like water. Just nothing can replace sleep for me but I couldn’t sleep even if I tried - and really want to. 
My mom takes my toddler a couple times a week like today to help. He was gone from 11am-4pm and I STILL couldn’t nap because the baby takes forever to get down (I try anywhere between 60-90mins and check all his sleep cues) and only stays down temporarily. By the time I get drowsy to sleep, baby is up crying. This is TOUGH! My husband does his best to help out as best he can but he sees how hard it is with the baby. 

Ugh. Anyone been in this situation? Are you alive to tell your story? Does everyone just have unicorn babies that are content, happy and easy to take care of because they don’t exist in my little family 😅 it’s hard not to compare to my family members around me that have happy content babies over and over, thriving. Going out and doing all the things while I’m in pajamas and staying home 24/7. The reels/post I see about going from 1-2 kids “was so much easier” got me feeling like 🧐. I feel like I’m a new mom all over again and that I’m doing something wrong when I’m literally researching all the time and implementing what everyone else is doing…that’s not working. 

TLDR: have a 2 yr old and 2 month old. Severely sleep deprived. Breastfeeding. Tried taking Cara babies program. Not helping. Baby takes very short naps. Takes forever to get him to nap.
