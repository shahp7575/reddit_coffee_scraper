The canister is entirely plastic-based, not compostable or refillable, so every single one goes straight to landfill. Multiply that by the millions sold every year, and it adds up fast. Nestlé as a company has also been under fire for years, unsustainable cocoa sourcing, child labor in supply chains, water rights disputes… the list is long. And this product doesn’t carry a single sustainability certification.

On top of that, the ingredients are pretty much ultra-processed filler: sugar, artificial flavors, maltodextrin, soy lecithin, synthetic vitamins. Not only are they bad for your health over time, but producing these additives at scale isn’t exactly low-impact either.

1nbon5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1nbon5r/what_do_i_do/,What do I do?,"I just started working at a very small coffee shop as a barista. I have no real experience—other than being a latte addict. Years ago I had an espresso machine at home, and a friend who managed a Starbucks gave me a few tips, so I’m not completely clueless.

Here’s the thing: the two 20-something baristas training me (I’m 40-ish) do not purge the steam wand before or after making drinks, they don’t wipe it down, and they reuse steamed milk.

The other day I came in for my shift and there was a jug with an inch or two of steamed milk just sitting on the counter. An hour later a customer ordered a latte, and the barista grabbed that same jug, topped it off, and used it. That milk had been sitting out for who knows how long!

Then, when showing me how to clean the machine at closing, she finally purged the wand. The amount of crusty, rotten milk that came out was vile.

I’ve resorted to YouTube for proper training because I want to do things right…but as the brand-new person, how do I tell them what they’re doing is absolutely disgusting without sounding like the annoying “know-it-all” newbie?",3,1757340295.0,barista,3,1.0,False

# **Original**

[**A man came up to me and said he was my father, but I already know who my dad is, or do I? What should I do? Is he a scam artist?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/senxl/a_man_came_up_to_me_and_said_he_was_my_father_but/)

He claims that he was married to my mom before my dad and she left him for my dad. He says this happened while she was pregnant with me and she put my dad on the birth certificate and ""they"" (my parents and grandfather) used their power and money to make sure he couldn't stay in contact with me. He also claims when I was five he tried again and my dad broke his fingers. He says he is just now contacting me because with my grandad's tragic death last year it's ""safe"" now.

Issues with this story:

1. He had no documentation (although he promised to show me some and suggested he bring it by my apartment...that he knows the location of) 
2. I am 20, why now? 
3. My dad is a nonviolent man, I can't see him breaking anyone's fingers. He never spanked me when I was a kid and was always the pushover parent 
4. My grandad traded stocks, he was hardly a mafia kingpin 
5. My parents were childhood sweethearts and are still crazy about each other...in addition to being decent people

He also kept commenting on my money (saying I looked like a banker (in jeans and a button up) asking if my dad gave me my watch and how much my bike cost). He did tell me his name and his number and show his license and I am considering running a background check, but my parents see my expenses.

In his favor: 

1. I look like him 
2. I've never seen my parents wedding pictures
3. He didn't seem insane
4. He knew a lot of information that would be hard to find about my family 
5. He mentioned a coat I had as a kid 
6. I am an only child, my mom said that they never got so lucky as to have another

I don't know. I would usually ask my parents, but my mom just got diagnosed with breast cancer and I don't want to worry her or my dad that some pyscho is trying to swindle me or harass or harm me.

**tl;dr** man says he is my father. My dad has always been in my life and presumed to be my bio dad. Could this be a scam? How should I check it out? (my parents are going through a crisis so I'd rather avoid bothering them)

**EDIT 1** 

I called my real dad first, deciding that he was a better call than fakedad or the cops (until I access the situation). I asked if he knew NAME. He responded by asking if I was at my apartment, when I said yes, he said he'd be here in half an hour. Shit, this isn't good.

**EDIT 2** 

He is my biological father. My dad AND my mom showed up, he said it was more her story than his. Apparently when they were married he was abusive. When she told him she filed for divorce he pushed her down the stairs and she had to be hospitalized. She decides promptly that he will never get near enough to hurt her child. Her childhood best friend offers to marry her. This is all pretty convoluted. My life and parents are a lot different than they were this morning.

&nbsp;

---

**What happened after your parents came?**

*I opened the door- I was surprised to see my mom. Although I should've known he wouldn't come alone (both because that's not how they do things and because on Tuesdays at that time he is usually home between business and raquetball). We greet.*

*My mom hugs me. My dad just puts his hand on my cheek and says that I'm everything he could want in a son. I say so, who is NAME?*

*My mom says I'll start at the beginning- I met him when I was 19, he was a moody violinist and it seemed the right amount of rebellion to fall in love with him. I was hardly the type to date a drummer. And then it unfolded.*

*By the end me and my mom are crying. My dad is holding her arm. And I don't know why this bothered me but I asked if they were in love. My dad said I've loved your mother since I was five years old, but we're both so stubborn it may have taken us forty years to realize it if we hadn't become a family to protect you. We were going to get a divorce when you were two, but we were so happy neither of us brought it up.*

*Then we all laughed a little and I'm heading there for dinner in a few hours. It's a screwed up situation but my family is still my family and i'm a lucky guy.*

---

**Did your dad break his finger**

*Yes... my dad said when I was little my mom caught him watching us in the park and promptly ushered me into the car. He came to the apartment and she went down to the lobby, he cornered her and when his ""charm"" (I gave you such a fine son, he's got my looks doesn't he, I think the least you owe me is a few hours) grabbed her leaving bruises and had to be escorted out by security.*

*He was waiting for my dad outside his office the next day.My dad is angry but listens to him go on, give a man enough rope to hang himself he always says. Then he mentions money. He's been deprived of his son, if this continues reparation only seems fair. my dad decided that you can't stalk his family and shake around his wife with loose threats.*

*So he grabs his hand and twists it until it breaks- telling him that the next time will be his bow hand. And he will never give him a dime or let him ruin his son.*

---

**How did your parents marry?**

*My parents claim they married as friends to give me a name other than his and a ""father"" to make it difficult should the abusive ass ever attempt to use me as leverage.*

*Then they fell in love. Originally they planned to divorce after a respectable time frame, but they found marriage suited them.*

---

**How are you parents now?**

*They've always been best friends. There's a picture on our mantle of them at five years old, their nannies used to let them play together. They were never romantic they both claimed. My mom says her father was so severe and unemotional that she never would have risked the person closest to her for mere dating. Then they got married to protect me and they're madly in love.*

*They have lunch together every day.I remember as a kid being embarrassed by how much they touched- that during a sleepover we'd walk out and they'd just be reading with his head in her lap. They're very happy.*

*Honestly this story seems completely out of nature for him.He's really mild mannered, never raised a hand to me. My mom is the more serious partner.*

---

**Why no half siblings**

My dad is infertile. They tried for years to have another baby and it never happened.

---

**How do you fairly consider both sides when there's strong emotional and physical evidence of abuse?**

Honestly, this makes sense. It explains the situation and my mom to an extent, who spends so much time volunteering with domestic abuse charities. also, you can't fake emotion, we were all practically crying by the end.

Plus, he was imprisoned briefly for this. And my mom has scars from where she had to have surgery on her leg.

# **Update 1 - 1 day later**

[**[update]A man came up to me and said he was my father (I have a sister)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/shcjt/updatea_man_came_up_to_me_and_said_he_was_my/) 

My question got an amazing amount of replies and I appreciate it, so, not being an ass I decided to give a final update before I go back to my usual account.

After a lot of thought, I've decided that, all issues aside, I simply have no interest in this man who has my jaw and some shared DNA. I'm a junior at NYU doing a dual major and overload this sem, between that and lining up internships I barely have time to sleep. I have a great family and couldn't ask for better. I was never that kid who wished his parents were anyone else (except maybe batman when I was 9.) I wish I had more time for them than once a week dinner and phonecalls, I don't wish I had some extra father figure and I've got enough friends.

If he were a decent man I might feel like I owe it to him. But considering the fact that his actions resulted in this and if my mom had stayed I would have been raised in an abusive home, likely abused myself, I don't feel bad about this- just relieved.

I also (for those who are worried about any possible truth from fakereal dad) i asked my dad if I could see any of the paperwork on my bio dad, to assuage curiosity. He assuaged my curiosity. The divorce papers were in there, the restraining order, and even pictures of my mom after he shoved her. Yeah, he's an scumbag.

He was waiting at my usual coffee shop today (will find a new one) and basically was pushy and an ass. He never once admitted any kind of wrong doing or anything. I ended the conversation by saying ""Thank you for contacting me, but I am happy in life right now, if I ever change my mind I will contact you"".

He then got this weird look of outraged dignity and said that I was an ungrateful little bastard and that if were richer than my dad I'd be on my knees. Then he said that without him I wouldn't exist. Said I was his only son and he wished he didn't have one, hell, he wished he didn't have a daughter as she was just as ungrateful. He said a lot more but that's the gist.

I have a dad, it's not this joker. I may look up the sister at some point in the future when I have the time and mind set to explore that. Although, she's probably just a kid.

tl:dr No interest in forming relationship with biodad, due to his past acts (satisfying proof seen) I also don't feel obligated. He stalked me today and confirmed this. Oh, and I have a sister.

&nbsp;

**About OOPs safety**

*Unfortunately, I think the best thing if for me to take up my dad's offer of a car and driver until all of this settles. I will also be moving into a rental property we own because it has tighter access, ie a doorman has to admit you. I honestly should have been in a nicer apartment anyways- just on the off chance someone finds out my parents worth and thinks my place would be nice to case.*

---

**About sister**

*Yeah, I won't contact him about it- I'll have a routine background check and she should show up*

*I honestly don't know what to do about it or how to go about it. What if her life is horrible? I don't really have any power to change it. What if she's like 8 and lives across the country? it seems doubtful we'd connect on any meaningful level*

*I can only assume she has a caregiver and hope its a good one. Honestly, contact from me won't do much if she was in a bad situation. I'm a 20 year old kid whose income until my first trust opens is entirely dependent on my parents and I'm not even legally her brother, it's all word of mouth.*

*I guess the main point is I see no need to rush. Even if she's in a less than tenable place, there's little I can do to change anything.*

*although I can't help but feel horrible when I think of the pictures of my mom I saw, her face bloodied from his hands and her body bruised because he shoved her down the stairs and feel bad for any kid he raised.*

---

**About bio father**

*I'm dismissing my biological father because he's an abusive ass. He pushed my mom down a flight of stairs while pregnant after he knocked her around a little, she still has a slight limp. To me that's unforgivable.*

*To me, shared experiences are what bond people anyways. That's why I love my parents. Not because of money of blood. I have no interest in a relationship with him. If he hadn't been abusive we would have had an obligated lunch but I still wouldn't truly want to form a relationship- I would just feel obligated to this stranger.*

*I just don't want to start something until I've considered the implications. This could be just as negative in the girl's life as it could be positive. It's also possible that she might be in contact with my bio dad who I want nothing to do with.*

*Let me adjust your ""facts"". Biodad did not live near poverty line. He was middle class. An amazing violinist who taught in the city and did very well. Also, my mom had access to her trust fund during the marriage and contributed a large amount into household income.*

*Their marriage lasted 2 years, not counting the separation. Records of hospitalization go back close to the beginning. The pictures of after the final incident have her with black eyes, odd in an accidental shove.*

# **Final Update - 6 months later**

[**[update]I'm not sure anyone remembers this, but about 6 months ago a stranger approached me on the street I found out my dad wasn't my bio father. Today I met my sister.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11hig2/updateim_not_sure_anyone_remembers_this_but_about/) 

I took some time, but eventually curiosity got the best of me. She's 17 with a five month old and her background is completely different than mine. We corresponded a little on the internet but met today. I drove two hours.

She seemed like a nice girl. But I didn't feel like any ""wow, we are related"" moment or strong sense of kinship. Maybe I don't know how siblings are supposed to feel. I don't know. Mostly it was awkward. Me and 17 year old girls don't have a lot in common. She said I reminded her of someone on Gossip Girls and owned Justin Beiber cds.

But she did reinforce my belief that I'm doing right by not connecting with the biodad. He hasn't seen her son and hasn't contacted her in a year.

Just wanted to let those of you who helped me out last year know. Thanks guys.

&nbsp;

**Meeting half sister**

*I'm a whole twenty one years old now- fall of vain wisdom and false prophecy. I guess, it's not just age (although I am the youngest in my friend group) but upbringing, too. She's... uninformed about so much. She was giving her son koolaid and I had to bite my tongue and kept swatting his hand to keep him from thumb sucking. She's also really into YOLO and partying and baby mama drama. She was nice..just really different.*

With a click, seven years of career and three years of long hair fell to the ground.

Three months—enough time for a resume refresh, a full interview schedule, and enough time for stubble to grow two centimeters.

1nbog6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatizeThemBack/comments/1nbog6h/cabin_neighbor_kept_stealing_our_firewood_and/,"Cabin neighbor kept stealing our firewood and blaming “local rules,” so I taught him a local rule of my own","Earlier this year, my friends and I rented a remote cabin in the mountains for a long weekend. Nothing fancy, but it had a wood-burning stove, great hiking trails nearby, and that quiet, foggy vibe that makes you forget your inbox exists.

The rental came with a covered woodpile out back. We were told it was fully stocked and included in the rental, just don’t waste it. Pretty standard. The first night we used maybe five logs for the stove. By morning, we noticed the pile looked… smaller. But we assumed we just miscounted.

Second morning, after another cold night, we went out to grab more firewood and realized nearly half the stack was gone.

We checked the security cam above the back door. At around 2:30 a.m., some guy in flannel PJs walked up to our cabin, grabbed armfuls of wood, and walked off like it was his job.

We found out from the rental host that the neighboring cabin — just barely visible through the trees — was privately owned. The guy had a reputation for “disagreeing with rental guests” about what’s shared and what isn’t.

Later that afternoon, as we were returning from a hike, we saw him outside his cabin. He waved.

“You guys burnin’ a lot over there?” he asked with a smirk. “Gotta be careful. Can’t take more than your share. Local rules.”

I smiled and said, “Right. Wouldn’t want to mess with local customs.”

That night, we waited until lights went out in his cabin. Then I left a little note in our woodpile that read:

**""Borrowed wood has to be returned with interest. Local rule.""**

Then we carried every last log inside our cabin and locked the doors. Every. Last. One.

The next morning, he was out front glaring at the empty wood shelter like someone had stolen his car.

We waved back from the porch, holding mugs of coffee by our roaring stove.

And yes, we left the place with some unused logs — because *we* follow the rules.

1nbofg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1nbofg1/the_journey_that_proves_adventure_still_lives_in/,The Journey That Proves Adventure Still Lives in Our World,"The Yukon Territory is not just wilderness. It’s a full-throttle acid trip through pine and tundra, where you catch your dinner in glacier-fed streams and cook it over a flickering fire below endless skies. In 2024 the Yukon shattered records with an estimated 596,100 visitors (including Yukoners) soaring past 2023’s 523,600, according to Yukon Tourism Indicators. Airport arrivals alone climbed 22 percent year-on-year, hitting almost 27,000 passengers in a single August, reported by the Government of Yukon. This territory is not quietly recovering. It is roaring.

In these mountains the real feast begins when you land a salmon on your hook or skin a caribou just harvested from wild timberline. Wilderness cooking camps dot the landscape where guides teach how to gut, season, and sear your catch over open flame. Charter an 8-day fishing adventure into the Ruby Range Lodge territory and expect to pay around USD 2,550 per person, or USD 1,460 for a four-day version, with lodgings, gear, meals, and guide included. That places you inside the raw alveoli of this land. No prep kitchens, no aprons, just gut and grit and flame. The perfect summer window is June to mid-July, and the hunt ends then. Not just for fish, but for mosquito tolerance too.

If blood mist is not your map, there’s adventure in other veins. Canoe the Big Salmon River on a 15-day guided paddle for an immersive price in CAD around 4,800, letting sweepers and swift water narrate your route. Or mount a horse and ride the Yukon backcountry across ridge and meadow on a 7–10-night horseback expedition starting at roughly USD 2,325. Indigenous guided experiences layer in culture. Watch caribou from lookout platforms (about USD 150 per person), or join a campfire storytelling night in Fort Selkirk starting around USD 650, which tethers wilderness to memory.

Best season? Summer. Late May to September delivers days longer than your burnout, with up to 22 hours of daylight and temperature grips between 6°C to 26°C, according to Travel Yukon. Spring and fall sing with wildflowers and fall color, and winter backdrops northern lights and snow-carving adventures, but to chase salmon and caribou the earth must be thawed, the sky endless, the bug nets ready.

Food here transmutes survival into ritual. Wild fresh-caught sockeye, hot off the fire, tastes like dawn. Bannock fried on coals, USD 3 at roadside stands, is the perfect knife to cut through rich fish fats. A cold Yukon beer or a shot of local brewbacks that memory for about USD 5. If you’re at a lake cook-out, expect to pay USD 99 for a full salmon bake experience, complete with sides, bottomless iced tea, cowboy coffee, and the kind of smoky bliss that clings to clothes until they bury you.

Accommodations. Cozy wilderness cabins go for USD 175 per night for two, or USD 700 to USD 875 for the week. These bunkers of comfort in the wild are as essential as warm toes at dawn.

Yukon’s tourism boom is in the data. The truth, though, lives where you gut a fish, light the fire, and taste your catch with wind pressing your ear. It’s primal, feral, and fierce. And travel statistics only prove that the world is waking to what used to be secret.

1nbofeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1nbofeo/does_dash_mini_maker_electric_griddle_live_up_to/,Does DASH Mini Maker Electric Griddle Live Up to 4.5 Star Reviews?,"Testing the DASH DMS001PK Mini Maker Electric Griddle has been an interesting and fun journey. This compact piece of kitchen magic seems like a peculiar blend of functionality and cuteness. Right from the moment I unboxed it, the playful pink design caught my eye. Honestly, I can see why it might make for a perfect housewarming gift or something to add a little charm to your kitchen counter. But as cute as it looks, it left me wondering—does it cook as great as it looks?

**Compact and Lightweight Design**  
The first thing I noticed was how incredibly lightweight this little appliance is. At just over a pound, you could practically carry it in one hand while brewing coffee with the other. Moving this from the kitchen counter to storage or even packing it for a quick RV trip feels ridiculously convenient. I’ve personally used it daily for a week, and it took up minimal counter space. For those in smaller apartments, dorm rooms, or with limited kitchen storage, this feature is a win.

**Quick Heating and User-Friendly Operation**  
The simplicity of the operation is another feature I immediately appreciated. Plugging it in and allowing the indicator light to turn off before cooking surprised me with how fast it heats up. We’re talking minutes here. The dual non-stick cooking surfaces ensure even heat distribution, which means those pancakes I tried first came out evenly browned and perfectly round—a struggle I often face with larger pans. One thing worth noting is that I didn’t have to use any oil or butter for non-stick results, which makes cleanup a breeze.  

[Check DASH DMS001PK price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b06w53zj8j/)

**Diverse Cooking Options**  
Calling this just a pancake maker might sell it short. Over the past few days, I’ve put this mini griddle through its paces with eggs, cookies, and even grilled cheese. It’s surprisingly versatile. For smaller recipes or moments when you need just one serving, it’s an absolute lifesaver. I also tried whipping up a quick hash brown on it, and while the result wasn’t overly crispy, it was consistent and satisfying. However, larger meals or anything requiring more cooking surface is where it struggles.

**Strengths**  
- Compact and insanely portable design.  
- Heats up quickly and evenly for consistent results.  
- Non-stick surface is genuinely non-stick—cleanup is child’s play.  
- Super lightweight, especially for travelers or students.  
- Perfect for single servings or small household portions.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Small cooking surface makes it unsuitable for larger recipes.  
- Limited functionality—this is not replacing your skillet or main griddle.  
- The power cord feels short at times, especially when outlets aren’t located nearby.  

**Included Extras and Build Quality**  
The DASH Mini Maker also comes with a petite recipe book and access to an online database of unique ideas. As far as the build quality goes, I’d say it feels reasonable for an item in this price range. While it lacks the premium feel of pricier griddles, nothing about it feels inherently flimsy. I’ll admit I was skeptical about its durability because of how cute (and let’s be real, somewhat toy-like) it looks. But after nearly a week of daily use, it powered through without showing any signs of wear.  

**Industry Competitors**  
I’ve had my eyes on similar compact griddles like the Bella Electric Mini Griddle or even Dash’s other Mini Maker models. Compared to competitors, the DASH Mini Maker’s design is perhaps its strongest selling point. While others in the same category skim close in performance, they often lack the stylish flair or lighter weight offered here. If you’re just looking for a basic griddle and don’t care about aesthetics, there’s not a huge difference in cooking ability. However, Dash’s recipe database access and wider brand recognition as a reliable maker of mini appliances edge it slightly ahead of some direct rivals.

**Affordable Quality**  
Whether this little pink wonder is worth the money depends on your lifestyle and needs. If you value convenience, portability, and single-piece cooking solutions for smaller portions, this griddle justifies its price point beautifully. Larger families, though, or those expecting more robust performance may want to look elsewhere. On the affordability spectrum, it strikes a good balance: functional enough not to feel like a throwaway gadget, but lightweight on the wallet.

Durga's Most Captivating Scents,"D.S. & Durga captured my heart with their distinctive approach to perfumes. Their style is clear, and they have a masterful understanding of their signature fragrance notes. Here’s a review of my favorite scents, including their latest release, Cognac Reign.

***Cognac Reign***  
**Notes:** Caramelized Bergamot, Antique Wood, Cognac Essence, Concrete of Orris, Tonka, Limousine Oak  
  
**My Thoughts:** The newest release from D.S. & Durga will catch you in a whirlwind. A woody gourmand evoking the feeling of a royal party that lasts all night long. There’s a hint of lacquered parquet floors, powdery wigs, and gooey caramelized bergamot. A sweet scent for those who enjoy complexity and a boozy touch.

***I Don’t Know What***  
**Notes:** Bergamot Essence, Iso E Super, Vetiver Acetate, Civettone, Firsantol, Ambrox Super  
  
**My Thoughts:** D.S. & Durga are pioneers in creating groundbreaking scents that leave a lasting impact on the perfume community. I Don’t Know What is no exception. One of the first skin scents on the scene, it turns heads and invites compliments. It’s a fresh, zesty take on Iso E Super.

***Debaser***  
**Notes:** Bergamot, Green Leaf, Pear Stem, Fig, Coconut Milk, Iris, Blond Woods, Tonka Bean, Moss  
  
**My Thoughts:** One of the original fig scents. Juicy green goodness, softened with coconut milk and dry musks. Compared to other fig perfumes, this one doesn’t take itself too seriously.

***Sweet Do Nothing***  
**Notes:** Neroli, Green Coyote Chola, Desert Pepper, Texas Everbearing Fig, Orange Flower, Incense, Texas Cedar, Water Musk, Creosote  
  
**My Thoughts:** A cousin to Debaser, but with a pocketful of incense and desert dirt. It’s surrounded by the sandy Texas landscape, juicy cacti, and a cowboy hat resting on your head.

***Rose Atlantic***  
**Notes:** Bergamot, Petals, Lemon Oil, Linden, Rose Accord, Dune Grass, Muscone, Salt Water, White Moss  
  
**My Thoughts:** The prettiest girl you’ve ever seen walking down the boardwalk in a flowy dress, carrying an armful of pink roses. Delicate rosy petals embrace warm musk and the fresh breeze of salt water.

***Radio Bombay***  
**Notes:** Radiant Wood, Copper, Cedar, Sandalwood, Radiant Iris, Boronia, Balsam Fir Absolute, Coconut Musk, Ambergris  
  
**My Thoughts:** A bone-dry sandalwood scent, like copper wires entangled in an old radio. It evokes a room filled with vintage furniture and dust floating in the air. Polarizing.

***Steamed Rainbow***  
**Notes:** Red Mandarin, Orange, Yellow Elemi Resin; Heart Notes: Green Cedar, Blue Almond Flower, Indigo Grass; Base Notes: Violet, Vetiver, Vapors  
  
**My Thoughts:** There’s a reason everyone calls this perfume nostalgic. It smells like summer during childhood. Water heated by the hot sun in a green rubber hose or the scent of an indoor pool. Realistic and surprisingly wearable.

***Brown Flowers***  
**Notes:** Acacia, Dried Cedrat, Queen Anne’s Lace, Brown Orchid, Coffee Flower, Sambac Jasmine, Aged Musk, Roots, Coffee  
  
**My Thoughts:** If you ever wanted to smell like the IT girl from the early ’70s with bell-bottom jeans, a suede vest, and big orange sunglasses—this is it. Wet dried jasmine and orchid flowers dipped in leftover coffee, spiced with cedrat.

For context we both work everyday and we have four cats. In the morning I wake up and I feed the cats, clean their litter, fill up their water, pack my partners lunchbox and my own, make us both a coffee, clean up anything from the night before, get the diffusers going, make the bed, start on laundry all while she wakes up brushes her teeth and gets dressed. I have voiced many times how I wish she would wake up earlier to help me start the day, on top of that she always talks about how she doesn’t feel like she looks good but she won’t do her hair or any makeup or anything for work because she just slaps on an outfit and is out the door. AITAH? I just feel like having a routine in the morning is so good for people and every-time I tell her this she just says she needs the extra sleep. 

I’m gonna add an edit because I left some things out: 
- she LOVES to do fun makeup and hair and talks all the time about how she actually wants to get up and get ready for work and do her hair and makeup, that’s why i mentioned it- she looks perfect no matter what she does! 
I think I more so am looking for how can I help her feel better! I say i do 80% of the household tasks as a whole morning and night and while I agree with some of you that yes I do these things on my own accord (ie lunch and coffee and such) but if I don’t do them, they don’t get done at all and then it’s just an upset morning on her end.

October 26, 4:00 PM. Suburbs of the Megapolis.

An autumn mood. Yellow-orange leaves fell from the trees, and the air outside smelled of freedom. People were walking home from work, schoolkids, joyful after their autumn break, were heading home. The sun was shining unusually bright for the gloomy, horror-filled month of October.

Among this crowd, only Freddy walked slowly, calmly munching on a warm burrito, a shopping bag in his other hand. He thought of only one thing: to get home, make dinner, open a bottle of wine, enjoy it with some cheddar, take a relaxing bath, and start reading the new volume of his favorite book.

He reached his car, packed everything into the back seat, and drove home. He lived in one of the city's skyscrapers. As he drove, he watched the people and the world outside. Enjoying every second of his vacation, passing through squares already being decorated for the upcoming holiday, he realized this would be one of his most pleasant breaks. After parking, he noticed a strange shadow. It unsettled him; a chill of terror ran down his spine, but he didn't pay it much mind. Grabbing his purchases, he took the elevator up to his apartment. Slowly unlocking the door, he stepped inside.

October 26, 7:30 PM. Fred's Apartment.

Freddy cooked his favorite pizza, enough pasta for a few days, and an aromatic soup. He turned on the TV, started watching a show, and devoured the hot pizza, thinking about the wine and a warm, gentle bath. Enjoying the evening, he heard a noise from outside his apartment—like the sound of something scraping against metal. He approached the door, trying to fight his fear and the sinister chill of the evening. He slowly walked up to the door and very carefully looked through the peephole. He saw a semi-purple shadow. Fred froze in terror; his palms and face were so sweaty one might think he’d just stepped out of a sauna. Gathering his thoughts, he decided it must just be a trick of the light, reflections from the windows in the stairwell... but he didn’t dare go out to check. The noise grew louder with each passing second, the shadow along with it, and Fred’s fear escalated in tandem. He retreated deeper into the apartment to calm down.

Locking himself in the bathroom with his wine, he began to enjoy the wine and the sound of the warm water filling the tub. As it ran, he thought to himself:

""FRED""—What could that have been..? The entrance is locked.. the windows are too.. Maybe it’s just reflections and the neighbor’s dog got loose...? Ah, whatever. I shouldn’t think about this. I don’t want to ruin my own evening. It would be nice to add some bubble bath and a forest berry bath bomb. And I should lock the door with all three deadbolts.

Fred said this and exited the bathroom. He began to move slowly, cautiously, and very quietly through the apartment. The noise outside his apartment didn’t stop.Hearing these screams, Fred was terrified, ready to cover his ears or escape down the fire escape. But with each passing moment, the screams only grew louder. He’d had enough. Fueled by anger and frustration, he grabbed his phone and called his musician neighbor.

""FRED""—What the hell is going on? Not only does his dog trash the hallway, but he’s recording his fucking albums in the evening. I hope it scratches his damn door to shreds.

Fred said angrily, dialing his neighbor. The phone just rang and rang, and soon the call dropped entirely. Fred was too upset and fairly drunk by now to care anymore.

Writing off his neighbor, he slowly walked to the kitchen for more pizza and cheese. He gazed out at the beautiful city from his height, enjoying the magnificent October night, when he saw some kind of shadow leaping between buildings. From below, the sound of ambulance and police sirens was audible, accompanied by the nearby drone of helicopters. This terrified Fred. He was on high alert and, more than anything, wanted to be in his bathroom right now—with its strong walls, bolted door, and no windows. He felt sick after everything that had happened, but once all the noises finally died down, he immediately put in his earplugs and, hearing nothing, began to take his bath. After the routine, he felt better. Removing the earplugs, he could only hear his neighbor on the landing doing something.

Probably cleaning up his dog’s shit, Fred thought, and went to his room.

October 26, 9:20 PM. Fred's Apartment.

Freddy, softened by the wine and water, went to bed with the window open. He could feel the autumn smell and the wind. He could forget all the noise from today like a bad dream. He could finally calmly read his favorite book, the one he’d been waiting for all day. He began to read against the backdrop of a beautiful nightscape and the cool, fresh autumn breeze. Fred didn’t even realize how quickly he fell asleep.

October 27, 5:50 AM. Fred's Apartment.

Fred was awakened through his sleep by the sound of water, the smell of bleach, and the sound of rubber suits in the hallway. Half-asleep and angry, he grabbed his phone and started moving closer to the door. The closer he got, the louder the sounds became. Now fully awake, Fred began to sweat, frantically trying to figure out what was happening. Slowly, he leaned against the door, wanting to look through the peephole, but it was smeared with a black-red substance. This sent Fred into a rage; he didn’t give a damn what was behind the door anymore. The moment he swung it open, he froze in fear.

He saw five unknown people in white suits, with various cases and test tubes, cleaning blood from the hallway and carrying a large black bag out of his neighbor’s apartment. The entire hallway was covered in deep scratches and signs of a struggle. Fred immediately retreated into his apartment and began frantically reaching for his phone to call the police. Slowly dialing 911, he realized there was no signal and no electricity on the entire floor. He tried to calm down and understand what was happening. From fear, he grabbed a cigarette and stepped out onto the balcony to smoke. Looking into his neighbor’s window, he paled and uttered only:

""FRED""—FUCK.

Fred vomited. He saw a severed finger in the neighbor’s window. Bloody handprints and glass smeared with blood. Someone was cleaning it. A person in a white suit looked up at Fred.Though his eyes were hidden, Fred understood from his gaze that this was none of his business. As soon as Fred stepped back into his apartment from the balcony, he smelled a strange odor. And Fred collapsed to the floor.

October 27, 6:40 AM. Fred's Apartment.

Fred jolted awake. He didn’t understand what was happening. Panic, fear, and anger ate away at him from the inside. He ran out into the hallway, but when he stepped out, he saw absolutely nothing. No signs of a struggle. No bloodstains, let alone any people. Fred was deeply disturbed by this.

""FRED""—What was that? I can’t believe it. That was definitely not a dream. IT WASN'T A FUCKING DREAM.

Fred said, lighting a cigarette. He smoked right there in the apartment. He turned on the TV, switching channels, trying to understand what had happened to him during the night. It couldn’t have been just a dream.

Then Fred stumbled upon the morning news..

""ANCHOR""—GOOD MORNING, RESIDENTS OF |CITY REDACTED|! Today with you is your MORNING NEWS ANCHOR! Brew your coffee, get comfortable, and LET'S GO! Overnight,the new cryptocurrency ""BOOM$DOG"" surged by a whopping 70%! A single coin of this new currency is now worth a staggering $70,000, surpassing the price of BITCOIN!

Our condolences from the entire channel.. Now onto other news..

Fred turned off the TV, smoking his cigarette in complete shock. Primarily from the fact that he had invested in the new coin and was now rich, and from the realization that last night's events were not a dream. He was covered in adrenaline and horror",1,1757339273.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False
1nbo7cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nbo7cu/should_i_pay_for_wifes_friend_to_come_visit/,Should I pay for wife's friend to come visit?,"Looking for some advice. My wife brought up the idea of paying for her close friend who lives in another state to fly over and stay with us for a bit as a birthday gift (to my wife and her friend because their birthday's are close, and they typically exchange gifts with each other every year.)

  
I have no issues with hosting her friends. Last year we hosted this friend which was fine, but someone else helped pay for her to come visit, and the idea of us paying their fare is kind of bothering me and I'm not sure if I should go along with it or not. I only briefly looked at costs and it will probably be in the range of $400-$500 plus probably covering meals and stuff while she is here. 

While we could afford  that, I think it bothers me for a number of reasons. One being that some of my closest friends live out of state too now, but I don't think any of us would accept something like that from one another, and when we do hang out we're always very clear about splitting costs fairly or paying others back at another time. My wife tends to just offer to pay for things for other people because she doesn't want to deal with the ""awkwardness"" of dealing with splitting costs, even for things like a joint coffee order for the whole office. 

This friend has confided in us some financial troubles they are in, but with deeper conversations we've had about it, we know that a lot of the issues are self-inflicted and on some level it also feels like we would be subsidizing her poor decision making by gifting her free travel. However, this is where I am more conflicted because if I think of it in terms of being a gift for my wife to get to see her friend I feel more okay with going along with it because I would other wise be spending that money towards some random gift/nice dinner she probably wouldn't need. 

We definitely aren't rolling it in by any means, but we have gotten to a decent point financially because we've made a lot of sacrificing. I was able to let my wife quit and be a stay at home mom, because she wanted to do that and hated her job. We cut back and don't spend a lot on traveling and extras so that we can save for our retirement and for our new child to have a good life. So that kind of goes back to the last point, that it almost makes me feel a bit angry in a sense to be spending those discretionary funds on someone else like that because they can't figure out how to save for themselves and I would rather put that money towards a fun experience with our child.

  
Some other backstory that isn't completely relevant, a few years ago the friend's now ex-husband had arranged a surprise trip to Disney for her and asked us to go too. We did, and made our own arrangements. During the trip they wanted to stop and get a drink at a bar within the park (which my wife and I would never do on our own because who wants to pay for overpriced amusement beers) and we each paid for our own drinks but their card came back declined. My wife immediately interjected that we'd cover their drinks too, and neither of them mentioned paying us back later or anything of the sorts. And on the last night they asked to share our hotel room because they had some issue with their airbnb, which of course we did, but again no real mention of returning the favor and the whole thing just kind of came across as entitlement.  I don't blame her friend necessarily for any of this because this was all a surprise for her by her ex-husband but why plan a trip to Disney if you can't afford the trip to Disney?? and it just rubbed me the wrong way about their character ever since.

With the EFZO-FIT readout window now almost upon us, I wanted to take a step back and put together a detailed and factual overview of where things stand - both for those who’ve been in the trade for a while and also for anyone tuning in for the first time. This post isn’t intended to be a trading signal or a call to action - it never is. This post isn’t bullish or bearish. My aim here is to lay out the facts as they stand, so that the post is as useful to shorts as it is to longs. My goal is to break down the major moving parts of the setup -  what matters, how to interpret the tape, and why certain market dynamics are surfacing at this pivotal point.

This post is intended to serve as a reference for everyone. In this post you’ll find sections on options mechanics, short interest, float structure, sentiment, and catalyst timing. The analysis reflects my current read on the setup, rooted in facts, data, and market structure, and leaves behind the noise and somewhat ridiculous drama that’s been dominate social media of late.

Hopefully, if you’ve followed along with the analysis over the last few months and taken ATYR as a case study, you’re getting more comfortable reading the tape in situations like this. But I still think there’s value in walking through it piece by piece - seeing how I break it down, and what I’m paying attention to. If nothing else, I hope it helps sharpen your own approach as you look at similar setups in the future.

As always, if you find value in these write-ups - whether you’re building out your own process, learning the mechanics of event-driven biotech trading, or simply want to support independent, open-access research – I’d really appreciate your support via Buy Me a Coffee. The time and effort that goes into sourcing, cross-checking, and synthesising this kind of analysis is significant, and your support is what keeps it available for everyone.

Okay, let’s get into it.

**Options Chain & Volatility**

In a setup like this, where the readout could fundamentally reprice the stock, the options market is a crucial barometer for what participants are expecting and how risk is being managed. It isn’t just about who’s betting bullish or bearish - it’s about how the entire market is positioning around a major uncertainty. 

**Key Concepts:**
- **Open Interest (OI):** The total number of outstanding contracts at each strike. High OI at certain levels is a signpost of where positioning is heaviest – and where volatility could cluster.
- **Implied Volatility (IV):** A measure of how large a move the market is pricing in. IV north of 600% is not normal - it’s the kind of level you see when traders expect extreme movement, not gradual drift.
- **Gamma Exposure:** This is what forces market makers to buy or sell the underlying stock aggressively as prices move through key strikes, amplifying any move.

**Where Is the Market Positioned?**
- **Most Active Expiries:** September and October are clear focal points, but November and out-months carry meaningful OI too, as traders hedge or speculate on post-readout scenarios.
- **Strikes with Heaviest OI:** $5, $6, and $12 calls are the main clustering points, with open interest in the thousands. There’s meaningful activity at the $3 and $10 strikes as well, which could act as secondary pivots if price moves sharply.
- **Highest IV:** Several strikes show IV over 600%, concentrated around the money and at crowded call levels. 

| Expiry      | Strike | Calls OI | Puts OI | Implied Volatility (IV) |
|-------------|--------|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Sep 19, 25  | $5     | 23,941   | 11,250  | ~600%                  |
| Sep 19, 25  | $6     | 8,573    | 7,341   | ~600%                  |
| Sep 19, 25  | $12    | 23,322   | 54      | ~590%                  |
| Oct 17, 25  | $5     | 10,584   | 9,722   | ~500%                  |
| Oct 17, 25  | $12    | 9,909    | 203     | ~410%                  |
| Nov 21, 25  | $5     | 589      | 2,534   | ~370%                  |
| Jan 16, 27  | $2.50  | 2,511    | 1,642   | ~180%                  |

These numbers are approximate, based on the most recent option chain data. Actual OI can shift day-to-day, but the clustering and magnitude are clear.

**Why September 19 Expiry Matters**
- This is the main “reset point” in the near term. If the catalyst lands before expiry, thousands of contracts will need to be settled or rolled, forcing market makers and traders to adjust their hedges rapidly.
- If the readout comes after expiry, the focus and volatility will migrate to the October chain, but there could be a sharp unwinding and repositioning as September contracts expire.
- Expiry acts as a “volatility magnet.” The closer we get, the more each uptick in rumors or pre-readout noise can mechanically move the tape.

**How to Interpret the Setup**
- **Look for Clustering:** Strikes with major OI – especially $5, $6, and $12 - are natural battlegrounds. Any meaningful move toward or through these levels can cascade into forced buying or selling.
- **High IV = Market on Edge:** IV over 600% is a red flag for anyone not used to binary events. The market is saying: “anything could happen, and the move could be massive.”
- **Gamma Effects:** As price approaches high-OI strikes, market makers’ hedging can “chase” the move, creating feedback loops, especially in thin-float situations.
- **Expiry = Reset Button:** As September 19 draws closer, traders with short-dated options will be forced to close, roll, or delta-hedge, which may create violent price action. If the event comes during or just after expiry, I would expect even sharper swings.

**Balanced Takeaways**
- If you’re long: This setup means there is definite potential for outsized, mechanically driven rallies if the readout is positive and triggers a squeeze through key strikes. 
- If you’re short: The same mechanics that drive squeezes can obviously also cause air pockets on the downside, especially if the outcome disappoints and mass options unwind triggers selling.
- For both sides: In setups like this, the tape can move further and faster than most expect – not always because of the news, but because of how the market is structured and forced to respond.
- Options-driven volatility won’t care about sentiment or fundamentals in the moment - it’s all about positioning, hedging, and ultimately the physics of crowded trades.

**Extra Context for Readers**
- This is not what you’d call an everyday market – IV at these levels is rare, and options positioning is unusually crowded. Whether you’re bullish, bearish, or neutral, it’s worth knowing how much of the next move could be driven by pure mechanics rather than investor conviction.
- The September 19 expiry is the first major inflection point, but October, November, and January show the market is hedging for further event-driven volatility well after the readout as well.
- This setup can generate “booster” moves in stages, with each expiry or cluster of strikes acting as its own fuel. Time will tell.

**Short Interest, Borrow & Float**

When I look at the short mechanics in play for $ATYR, I have to say, even for biotech, this is a setup that seriously jumps off the page. The numbers here aren’t just outliers - they’re a sign that both sides of the tape are taking big risks, and that market structure itself could play as big a role as any fundamental news in the days ahead.

**Key Current Data (as of September 5, 2025):**
- **Short Interest:** 28,245,132 shares (NASDAQ)
- **Short Interest % of Float:** 29.43%
- **Short Interest Ratio (Days-to-Cover):** 5.48
- **Off-Exchange Short Volume:** 1,315,746 shares, 66.44% of off-exchange volume (FINRA)
- **Short Shares Availability:** Fluctuating between 0 and 500,000 (intraday/week)
- **Short Borrow Fee Rate:** 1.58% (relatively stable, but subject to change)
- **Fails-to-Deliver:** Multiple spikes (80,066 on 12 Aug; 276,042 on 8 Aug; 275,333 on 24 July)
- **Tradable Float:** Estimated as thin; 10–12% sticky retail, 2–3% insiders, most of the rest with institutions

**How I Read These Numbers:**

- **Shorts:** To me, seeing almost a third of the float shorted suggests this isn’t just about weak hands - it’s also about deep conviction from funds or larger players who either have a clear reason to be skeptical or are hedging for a big event. There’s real liquidity here, but the crowding can mean the risk of things moving quickly against the consensus is higher than usual.
- **Longs:** On the other side, the combination of a thin, sticky float and high short interest means there’s certainly fuel for a squeeze - that potential is obvious. Still, it’s never as simple as “shorts must cover” - crowded setups like this can sometimes resolve the other way, especially around binary catalysts, and squeezes are often sharp but brief.

**Takeaways and Observations:**

- **Short interest like this is rare for a reason:** The market doesn’t see this every day, and it tends to mean volatility gets exaggerated. In my experience, it’s not just about which side is “right” – it’s about how little room there is for everyone to get out at once if things turn.
- **The float structure is a double-edged sword:** I think when so much of the float is locked up, even a small change in sentiment or news can push things far. But the same float that can drive a squeeze can also turn into an air pocket on the way down if sentiment sours.
- **Borrow swings and FTDs keep me on my toes:** That 1.58% borrow fee doesn’t look scary in isolation, but when availability goes from zero to half a million shares in a week, it’s a reminder that supply can dry up or flood in with little warning. And persistent FTD spikes usually mean there are players pushing up against the edges of what the system will bear.
- **High days-to-cover is always interesting:** I tend to watch this number closely in setups like this. Above five, it feels like exits could easily get crowded if something sparks a move.

**My Perspective on the Risks and Setups:**

- I think shorts need to be extra careful with their sizing and exposure here, just because the setup is so compressed. Binary catalysts are notorious for blindsiding crowded trades -  even when the story looks “safe.”
- For longs, I’d be wary of leaning too heavily on a squeeze thesis alone. It’s not that a squeeze can’t happen - the mechanics are clearly there. It’s just that these rallies can reverse just as quickly, especially if the outcome isn’t decisive or the move gets overextended.
- For both sides, my sense is that tape mechanics and positioning will be at least as important as the headline news in the short run. I’d expect any reaction to be fast, possibly disorderly, and probably not as “clean” as anyone would like.

---

**So where does that leave us?**  
I have a strong sense that this is the kind of setup where mechanics could take over from fundamentals - at least for a while. It feels spring-loaded, but with real two-way risk. A positive catalyst could easily ignite a squeeze, but that isn’t a guarantee, and a letdown could see things unwind just as quickly. For me, it’s all about watching the tape for signs of stress and being ready for a move that could go further and faster than most expect -  regardless of which way it breaks.

---

**Ownership Concentration**

Ownership structure is one of the core variables that shape how a stock like this trades-especially heading into a binary event. In the case of $ATYR, the story isn’t just about the science or the readout: it’s about *who* owns the float, *how much* is actually available for trading, and what happens if supply or demand shocks hit.

**Key Facts (as of September 5, 2025):**
- **Institutional Ownership:** 70,020,817 shares, or **71.5%** of shares outstanding, held by 194 institutional holders (mostly passive, some active).
- **Retail/Sticky Retail:** Estimated **10–12%** of float held by “sticky” retail investors—those who are likely not trading around the event and tend to hold through volatility.
- **Insider Holdings:** **2–3%** of shares are held by insiders (management, directors).
- **Tradable Float:** While the official float is higher, the *true* tradable float (shares not held by institutions, indexes, insiders, or sticky retail) is **very thin**, often less than 15% of outstanding shares. In practical terms, this means that out of ~98 million shares outstanding, the actual shares available to trade day-to-day are likely in the low-to-mid single millions.
- **Index/ETF Positioning:** Large positions are held by broad market and small cap index ETFs (IWM, IWO, ITOT, VTSMX, VEXMX), which tend to be mechanical in their rebalancing and do not provide “liquidity” in the sense that active traders do.

**Why This Matters**
- **Volatility Magnifier:** With so much of the float locked away in passive or “hold forever”-type hands, even modest supply/demand imbalances may drive huge price swings. If you see an outsized move on news or volume, it’s often going to be because there simply aren’t enough shares available to meet the market’s needs at that moment.
- **Squeeze/Unwind Risk:** In setups like this, both squeezes (forced buying) and unwinds (forced selling) can be violent. Neither side - shorts or longs - can count on being able to exit cleanly if the crowd moves all at once. This is the classic “float trap” scenario: the market structure matters as much as the fundamentals.
- **Institutional vs. Retail Dynamics:** Institutional holders (especially index funds) are price-insensitive and won’t provide liquidity during fast moves. Meanwhile, sticky retail tends not to sell into strength, adding to the volatility. If a squeeze gets underway, there are fewer shares for shorts to cover; if sentiment turns, there’s less cushion on the way down.

**Takeaways & Interpretation**
- **Why It’s Different This Time:** Compared to most small caps, $ATYR’s current setup is UNUSUALLY tight. Over 71% institutional, up to 12% sticky retail, and 2–3% insiders means the actual float that’s trading day-to-day is a fraction of the headline number. In my view, that sets the stage for moves that might quickly get disconnected from “fair value,” especially in the wake of the binary readout.
- **Why Ownership Structure Isn’t a Catalyst (Alone):** While many see a thin float as inherently bullish, it should be said that it cuts both ways. The same float mechanics that make a squeeze possible can also amplify a selloff if sentiment turns. The most important thing is to *respect the tape mechanics* and understand that price discovery can get extreme when the market is thin.
- **For Newer Players:** This is why you’ll often see small caps “not trade like they should.” It’s less about fundamentals, more about who owns what and how quickly they can move.

**Summary Table: ATYR Ownership Breakdown (as of Sep 5, 2025)**

| Category             | Shares Held      | % Outstanding | Notes                            |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Institutional        | 70,020,817      | 71.5%         | 194 holders, mostly passive       |
| Sticky Retail        | 9.8–11.8M est.  | 10–12%        | Estimated from float data         |
| Insiders             | 2–3M est.       | 2–3%          | Management, directors, 13D/G      |
| Index/ETF Holdings   | Large subset    | (in above)    | IWM, ITOT, VTSMX, VEXMX etc.      |
| Tradable Float (Est) | 10–15M          | 10–15%        | Actively trading at any time      |

**In My View:**  
The way I see it, this is as close to a textbook “float trap” as can be found in the market right now. With so much of the float locked away, even relatively small events have the potential to drive major price movement. That’s both a risk and an opportunity - mechanics can trump fundamentals for stretches of time. For anyone actively trading this setup (long or short), understanding *who* owns the shares, and how quickly they might move, is certainly just as important as understanding the trial data.

**Price Action & Technicals**

When I look at $ATYR’s tape, it’s a snapshot of classic pre-catalyst trading. There’s healthy two-way action, but aside from a couple of outsized days in late August - likely tied to index rebalancing - most volume has stayed in the normal to moderately above-average range. Through it all, the price has moved within a well-defined range, and both sides have been probing for conviction, but there’s little sustained momentum either way.

**Key Data & Facts (as of September 6, 2025):**
- **Volume:** Typical daily volume has been consistent, with the exception of those late August spikes (index-driven). Recent sessions have seen between healthy but not extreme volume ranges for this float.
- **Price Range:** $ATYR has mostly traded between $3.60 and $5.80 over the past month, with key support building around $4.10–$4.25, and resistance at $5.80 and up. The tape feels “range-bound,” and even the sharper moves tend to fade back toward these levels.
- **Volatility:** While there are plenty of 5–10% intraday swings, the action usually retraces, and the market has yet to find a real direction. This is what I’d expect before a true binary event, especially in a name with this sort of float and options setup.

**Key Learnings & Practical Insights**
- **Tape Action:** Price and volume, in the days before a catalyst, are usually more about positioning than news. Moves that look dramatic on a 15-minute chart are often mechanical - market makers hedging options, shorts jockeying for position, or retail chasing headlines.
- **Support & Resistance:** Support around $5.20 and resistance at $5.80 have repeatedly attracted interest from both buyers and sellers. The tape gets heavy at these levels, and recently, neither side has been able to force a meaningful break.
- **Volume Spikes:** When you do see outsized volume, it pays to look for the reason- late August’s spike was almost certainly index and ETF driven. It’s a reminder that not all big prints are about conviction or new fundamentals.

**My Interpretation of the Setup**
- From what I see, the price action fits an expected pattern in the final days before a biotech readout. Both sides are active, but nobody wants to show their hand until the event lands. There’s plenty of positioning, some “tape painting,” and the usual games, but the real story will only get started when the data hits.
- For newcomers, I think it’s worth emphasizing that pre-catalyst moves are often misleading. Tape action right now reflects event-driven flows and hedging, not fundamental news or new science. A move that looks like a “breakout” or a “flush” may just as easily reverse on the next session.
- This is a period where patience pays. My take is that the market is setting up for the main event, with both shorts and longs reluctant to go “all in” until the binary outcome arrives. It’s a technical holding pattern, and that’s exactly what I’d expect given the float, the event, and the options setup.

**Summary Table: ATYR Technical Snapshot (as of Sep 6, 2025)**

| Metric           | Value/Range      | Notes                                   |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Daily Volume     | 1–2.5M shares    | Spikes in late August (index flows)     |
| Price Range      | $3.60 – $5.80    | Support at $4.10–$4.25; resistance $5.80+ |
| Volatility       | 5–10% intraday   | Typical pre-catalyst chop               |
| Stocktwits/X     | Top 10 trending  | High event-driven and retail activity   |
| Technical Setup  | Range-bound      | No strong trend until catalyst          |

**Takeaway**  
In my view, this tape is being “played” - with both sides jostling for position and the algos taking advantage of every move. Until the binary readout, these price swings are mostly mechanical. For those watching, the real event hasn’t happened yet.

**Sentiment & Social Media: How Much of This Is Noise?**

Social media always heats up ahead of a major binary event, and $ATYR is no exception. In the lead-up to the readout, the volume of conversation on Stocktwits, Reddit, and X has been relentless, often pushing the stock into the top trending tickers on every platform. But unlike prior weeks, the nature of the discourse has become noticeably more adversarial, and the “signal-to-noise” ratio is as low as I’ve seen in a while.

**Key Data & Observations (as of September 6, 2025):**
- **Trending Everywhere:** $ATYR is consistently trending on Stocktwits, Reddit, and X. Post volume has surged as the readout window approaches, but there’s been no actual new science or “hard” data released in weeks.
- **Narrative Over Data:** The vast majority of recent activity is narrative-driven. The conversations are focused more on speculation, rumor, and positioning than on new developments or meaningful updates.
- **Bull & Bear Voices:** There’s still a core of serious analysis from both bulls and bears, with thoughtful discussions around trial mechanics, potential endpoints, and valuation. However, in my experience cataloguing sentiment, I’ve seen a pronounced uptick in aggressive, adversarial posting - most of it from the bear side.
- **Adversarial Tactics:** Lately, many of these bear-oriented posts are less about facts or detailed critique of the trial and more about stirring anxiety, shaking out weak hands, or flooding the feed with negativity. It’s classic “narrative warfare,” a tactic that is hardly unique to $ATYR, but it does add to the noise.
- **Hype on Both Sides:** There’s certainly some hype on both the long and short side - no surprise for a binary event setup. But the sheer volume and tone of negative posts has, in my view, become a notable feature of the current sentiment environment.

**Key Learnings & Takeaways**
- **Volume Isn’t Signal:** The fact that $ATYR is a top trending ticker doesn’t mean there’s a new signal. High volume on social media is often just a sign that positioning is crowded and emotions are running high—not that anything fundamental has changed.
- **Filter for Facts:** It’s critical to focus on what’s verifiable. Ignore emotional, bullying, or baseless posts - especially those that seem designed to provoke a reaction or instill doubt. In crowded trades, the loudest voices are often the least reliable.
- **Why It Matters:** For traders and investors alike, understanding the difference between “noise” and “signal” can be the difference between being shaken out of a position and sticking to a sound thesis. Social sentiment can absolutely drive short-term volatility, but it’s rarely a source of durable insight.

**My Read of the Situation**
- The reality is that this sort of “narrative warfare” is part and parcel of pre-catalyst biotech trading. I continue to catalogue and monitor the most extreme posts, not because I see them as actionable, but because they help me understand the psychological backdrop that can drive tape action - especially when volatility spikes.
- For those new to this space, my advice is to anchor to facts and mechanics, not the daily drama. Adversarial posts often say more about trader anxiety and positioning than about the underlying fundamentals of $ATYR or its trial.
- Ultimately, I see social sentiment as just another current in the river - sometimes it’s loud, sometimes it’s quiet, but it almost never tells you where the river actually leads.

**Catalyst Timing & Event Window: What to Expect**

Understanding the “catalyst window” is one of the most important skills in event-driven biotech trading. In this case, we’re entering what is almost certainly the most important two-week stretch in $ATYR history - so timing, mechanics, and risk management all matter more than ever.

- **Official Guidance:** Management has publicly said “mid-September” for topline readout. Based on typical company behavior, previous data drops, and public statements, most expect the binary to drop between September 15 and 19.
- **ERS & Embargo:** The ERS late-breaking abstract session is on September 30, but as noted in community discussion and via ERS’s own embargo policy, most embargoes lift on September 15. That’s another clue that public data could hit right after that date.
- **Options Expiry:** The most active expiry is September 19. If the readout comes before expiry, it sets up a maximum-volatility event as thousands of contracts are forced to resolve instantly. If it comes after, OI and IV can roll forward, but many “lottery ticket” plays will have burned out.
- **Most Likely Scenario:** Based on management’s history of Tuesday pre-market PRs and the above, many seasoned watchers (myself included) are pegging September 16 as the likeliest date. However, the window officially runs through September 30, and management can always adjust for strategic or regulatory reasons.
- **Historical Precedent:** Previous $ATYR readouts and most peer company binaries have dropped just before a major conference or options expiry, but there are exceptions. Never anchor to a single date; always be prepared for surprises.

**What to Watch For (Key Learnings):**
- *Catalyst timing* matters because it can determine whether mechanical tape forces (options expiry, ETF rebalance, etc.) magnify the move, or whether positioning resets in a new cycle.
- Knowing when risk “resets” (i.e., after expiry or after ERS) helps in sizing and risk controls, as crowd behavior changes once the catalyst passes.

---

**Scenarios: What to Expect As We Approach the Binary**

Here’s how I see the main tape and price scenarios for the next two weeks. Whether you’re new or seasoned, it pays to game out the mechanics before the move happens.

1. **Scenario 1: Readout Drops Before Sep 19 Options Expiry**
   - Forced options hedging, rapid tape moves, possible squeeze/unwind as September OI resolves in real-time.
   - Violent opening prints, huge volatility, market makers scrambling to rebalance. Short gamma positions can amplify the move.
   - Most “lottery ticket” contracts settle with a bang; risk resets into October.

2. **Scenario 2: Readout Drops After Sep 19 but Before ERS (Sep 30)**
   - September contracts expire worthless, new OI builds in October. Volatility remains, but short-term “magnet” effect is diminished.
   - Choppy trading, gradual OI bleed, and repositioning by traders who rolled contracts forward.

3. **Scenario 3: No Readout by ERS (Sep 30)**
   - IV collapses, options premiums drain, maximum anxiety as market “prices in” delay or uncertainty.
   - Tape re-prices for risk; sharp moves possible on rumors or leaks, but real volume likely waits for official drop.

4. **Scenario 4: “False Moves” or Volatility Spikes on Rumors**
   - Price whipsaws on news/rumor flow, but the true move only comes with formal topline release.
   - Traps for both sides, “fake-out” rallies or flushes, but fundamentals unchanged until data is public.

**Key Calendar Dates to Watch:**

| Date              | Event/Trigger               | Commentary                                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Sep 15            | ERS embargo lifts           | Earliest “safe” date for data drop                 |
| Sep 16 (Tues)     | Likeliest binary drop       | Fits company history and guidance                  |
| Sep 19 (Thurs)    | Options expiry              | Maximum OI in the chain; massive volatility event  |
| Sep 30            | ERS late-breaking session   | Full data set, KOL/management analysis, re-rate    |

**Takeaways and Perspective:**
- No one, not even management, can say with certainty when the binary lands. Treat all “date calls” as informed guesses, not gospel.
- The “window” is as much about psychology and market mechanics as it is about fundamentals; that’s what makes these periods so wild.
- If you’re trading around the binary, map your positions to these windows and know where your risk resets.

**In My View:**
- I continue to lean towards September 16 as the most probable date for topline, but with the caveat that we could see a surprise earlier or later. The options setup means that, whenever the data hits, the tape could move fast and far - mechanically, not just on fundamentals.
- For anyone sizing up trades or investments, the best approach is to know your windows, control your sizing, and expect the unexpected. In this environment, preparation matters more than prediction.

**Bringing It Together: Final Thoughts**

At this point in the $ATYR journey, we’re staring down the barrel of one of the purest event-driven setups in biotech that at least I can remember. Every single mechanical ingredient - record-high options open interest, wild implied volatility, nearly a third of the float shorted, a razor-thin tradable float, and relentless social media engagement - has come together to create what I see as a real “textbook” moment for anyone trying to learn how markets really work ahead of a binary catalyst.

Over the past few months, we’ve dug through the moving mechanical parts in granular detail:  
- **Options positioning is as crowded as I’ve ever seen in a microcap.** The September 19 expiry, in particular, is loaded with open interest at key strikes like $5, $6, and $12, with IV readings above 600%. This creates the potential for explosive hedging flows if the binary hits before expiry, or for wild repositioning if it lands after.
- **Short interest is at the upper limit for any stock this size,** with nearly 30% of the float reported as short, days-to-cover north of five, and real-time borrow availability swinging intraday between “none available” and just a few hundred thousand shares. Add in a borrow fee around 1.5% and persistent fails-to-deliver, and it’s clear that the supply/demand dynamics are stretched to their limit.  
- **Ownership structure amplifies everything.** With at least 10–12% of the float in the hands of sticky retail, another 2–3% with insiders, and the remainder held by a concentrated block of institutions, the “true” tradable float is far smaller than headline numbers suggest. This means even a moderate change in positioning can send the tape flying.
- **Tape action and volume tell the story of a market on edge.** Healthy volume and sharp swings above support show that both sides - bull and bear - are actively positioning for the catalyst, but neither has the upper hand until data drops.
- **Sentiment is maxed out and adversarial.** In cataloguing the last few weeks of social posts, it’s clear that the narrative battle is raging, with a rising volume of aggressive, often unfounded bear commentary, but also a fair bit of hype and wishful thinking from bulls. This kind of back-and-forth is exactly what you’d expect ahead of a major binary: neither side truly knows, so the loudest voices try to fill the void.

What does all this mean if you’re trying to learn from the setup - or just survive it?  
- **Volatility is guaranteed - direction isn’t.** With so many mechanical pressures converging, price can move farther and faster than fundamentals alone would dictate. That’s why risk controls and sizing matter so much right now.
- **Events like this are more about process than prediction.** The biggest lesson is not about “guessing” the outcome, but understanding how the setup itself shapes what’s possible. Mechanics, liquidity, and crowd behavior can all matter as much (or more) than the data - at least in the immediate aftermath.
- **Options expiry and catalyst timing are “force multipliers.”** Whether the readout comes before or after Sep 19 can change everything about how the move unfolds—violent forced hedging and “lottery ticket” resolution if before; mechanical OI bleed and new positioning if after. Both scenarios demand a real-time read on the tape.
- **Float and crowding are two-edged swords.** A thin float and sticky hands can drive explosive upside if the catalyst is good, but also sharp downside if crowd expectations are dashed and liquidity evaporates. Neither side is guaranteed a win, and tape mechanics can cut both ways.

**Educational Guidance & Key Takeaways for All Readers:**  
- For those new to this kind of trade: Pay attention to the interplay of options, short mechanics, float, and timing. Don’t get anchored to social narrative or let loud voices drive your thesis.
- For experienced hands: This is a near-perfect “stress test” for process. Watch how the market digests the binary - tape structure, volume flows, and speed of repricing often matter more than the headline itself.
- Across the board: Don’t let mechanics become your only thesis. The best setups are those where you respect both the data and the market structure, knowing that binary events can humble even the most experienced.

**In My View:**  
This is as close to a generational event setup as I’ve seen (is that overstating it?). Everything is set for a move that could define the year for small-cap biotech trading - regardless of direction. My strongest advice is to focus as much on risk as on profit. Learn from what the tape does, not just from the result. If you come away from this with a better understanding of mechanics, crowd behavior, and risk, you’ll have built a toolkit that will serve you in any binary event for years to come.

I hope that you have taken that away from my posts!

I will be visiting Australia for 5 days in February 2026 and was hoping for some help in planning out my itinerary. I would have loved to have had more time obviously but at least 5 days is better than nothing. I will be flying in and out of Cairns (Land in CNS 5pm Feb 18 and depart 7pm Feb 23) so I was trying to decide if its worth visiting either Sydney or Melbourne in addition? I will be traveling from Singapore so hopefully jet lag won't be terrible.

I realize I will have to book another round trip flight which will likely be expensive for potentially only 2 days in another city but wanted people's opinions on which city would be easier to navigate with only a couple of days. Of course I'd love to check out the famous beaches and sights of Sydney but am curious about the city vibe and coffee culture in Melbourne as well.

First time is Australia so please let me know if I'm missing anything in regards to logistics. Tentative idea is to spend February 18 - February 21 in/around Cairns and then fly to Sydney/Melbourne on February 21 and then back to Cairns in time for my flight on February 23.",1,1757339183.0,AustraliaTravel,2,1.0,False

**How One Petty Move Got My Awful Restaurant Boss to Quit**

 

A million years ago I was waiting tables at my first job, enter ye old standard dick boss could easily talk about what a dumb prick he was, but I'll skip to the straw that broke the camels back.

We were short handed one day, and I was pulling double closing work for my shift (remember, as a waiter you make $2.63 hourly plus tips, so anything that doesn't involve tips is essentially just slave labor that they can get away with pulling on you to keep your job...)

After I finished up my work, I ordered and paid for a lunch (something I would often do, 1/2 off is a decent deal)... Sombonavitch comes charging into the side room that employees would use to eat/relax in before and after work and just effing explodes at me (with an off duty cook watching). Another employee had simply bailed on their work, and he was blaming me for not having done TRIPLE duty before punching out. Essentially tells me that if I don't do the cleanup and restock before I went home that I would be fired (this was a waiters side station--restock glasses, straws, coffee cups, ice, etc...)...

I wanted to keep my job, so I did the job.. but when it was done, I felt that it could be better. I opened up the ice bin, and got another bucket of ice. Then another. And another. I filled the ice bin up to the ceiling, then I went home.

I had a message from him waiting for me when I got home, but laughed and went about my day. When I went in to work the next day, I had been fired, then an investigation had taken place, and I was rehired. Dildorino's hiring and firing privileges has been revoked, and had subsequently given his 2 weeks notice. :D

 

**The Tyrant Boss Who Made Everyone Miserable—Until We Took Him Down**

 

I have worked in retail for almost 9 years. One boss I had was terrible. I'm summing things up to keep the story moving.The full story takes way too much time to tell. He first started wouldn't shake my hand and basically said I sucked. Yelled at co-workers(upper managment), direct supervisors(lower management) and his regular employees equally. He made girls cry and go home from the stress of dealing with him. He was trying to assert his superiority by firing all vetern employees. Two things made me look for a way to get him fired. One he almost made my favorite supervisor quit(she's now my big boss). She left my store crying and I nearly took his head off. I would have if I could have found him. He liked to disappear after doing something dirty like this. Two he refused to have a young kid I worked with go to the hospital after I know he broke something in his ankle/foot area. This guy actually remarked ""are you a doctor?"". My response "" are you?"". Now say those two lines screaming at each other. That young man came back later. He shook my hand for defending him and then with a casted foot hobbled up to my boss and said ""fuck you, I quit!"". Very shortly after this the overall manager of my store forced him to quit. The official story is that he made the decision. But we know he had no plans to leave. Therefore they had to have forced him out. The one thing I can say is you don't mess with my favorite boss! We (my coworkers) called the human resources phone lines, complained directly to corporate level management, and refused to do any work he insisted upon. My favorite boss went through the channels available to her(high, high level management). We worked together and took down a tyrant. Nothing has ever felt so satisfying.

 

 

**How One Manager’s Ego Took Down an Entire Company’s IT—and Cost Millions**

 

I worked at a place that had outsourced its IT department (basically) and our so called manager treated those guys like shit. So they quit and because the program they used belonged to that company they just shut the entire place down effectively. When I headed upstairs to try to get the system going because the orders weren't going out the manager was in his office screaming at a pitch I've not heard a human make since trying to find anyone in IT. Which they couldn't because the numbers were in the system.

CEO arrives a few days later, nothing has been done and thousands of dollars have been lost. The manager was hiding out at the golf course. Customers have been burnt, no one else in town wanted to work with us.

When they eventually found a company that could do the work they charged them 6 times the original cost and the system would have half the functionality and not be ready for 5 months. Also the new guy looked so much like Tony Soprano we were all scared of him.

A lots of people lost their quit (like I did). Last I heard from an old friend was that the senior guys had all sued the manager in charge and him and his rich dad had to eat the cost.

I’m on week 3 but I just don’t know where to get pleasure from anymore. 

I always start off feeling really positive, everything’s great and I am happy to be changing my life etc. but then it wears off and I how I am right right now. I am irritable, have no interest in anything, indecisive and I feel unwell physically. I know from experience this is lack of dopamine and my brain is trying to tell me that. 

This morning I had an energy drink (which in general I don’t even like) and three strong coffees, no effect on me whatsoever, and I’m just constantly thinking what can I try next. My brain is even like maybe I should go get a vape, or start smoking again after years of not. Drinking has definitely been that crutch that has got me through the day - knowing I’ll have a glass of wine (or 6) in the evening 3-4 times a week. 

I don’t even know why I’m posting because the answer is order your meds, or speak to your GP etc. but I needed to tell somebody about it, and nobody else in my life really cares. My mum is always sending me ADHD memes and videos but doesn’t like being around me when I’m like this.

1nbo29l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeEasyMoney/comments/1nbo29l/interac_online_casino_canada_reddit_picks_2025/,Interac Online Casino Canada - Reddit Picks 2025,"Hey everyone. I’ve been gambling online in Canada for around five years now, and since so many folks keep asking about the best Interac online casino sites, I figured I’d share what I’ve learned as of 2025. When I first started, I used credit cards and random e‑wallets, but I soon switched to Interac e‑Transfer because it’s faster, safer, and much more convenient.
Back in the day, playing at land‑based casinos like Fallsview or Casino Montreal meant a long drive and waiting for a table. Over time, I realized that online casino interac platforms offer more convenience, more games, and better control over how I play. This post isn’t about hyping any particular site — just sharing what a Canadian gambler has figured out, especially around Interac deposits and withdrawals.

**What Makes the Best Interac Casino Online**

After testing dozens of Canadian online casinos that accept Interac e‑Transfer, I’ve noticed a few key things that separate the solid sites from the shady ones:

1) **Fast Interac deposits and withdrawals.** Deposits should land instantly (they usually do), and withdrawals shouldn’t take more than a few days. Interac withdrawals typically reach your bank in 1–3 business days after the casino’s internal review.

2) **Trusted software providers.** Look for games from Pragmatic Play, NetEnt, Microgaming, Play’n GO, etc.

3) **Support that understands Canadian banking.** Staff should be familiar with Interac e‑Transfer, not just generic payment methods.

4) **Smooth mobile play.** Slots and table games should work flawlessly on your phone.

5) **Reasonable bonuses.** Watch for wagering requirements that aren’t ridiculous.

**The Reality of Online Gambling in Canada**

Online gambling in Canada exists in a grey area. Most casino interac online platforms are licensed offshore (Malta, Curaçao, Kahnawake) but still accept Canadian players. The industry has matured in the last few years, and online casinos for real money have become more sophisticated. Many Canadians use Interac daily: it’s a domestic network established in 1984, and in 2022 Interac processed over a billion transactions in a single year, which speaks to how trusted it is.

However, major banks like RBC and TD sometimes block or reverse gambling-related transfers. In my experience, sticking to Interac e‑Transfer (rather than Interac Online) and using well‑known licensed casinos avoids most of the issues. You may encounter daily withdrawal limits around C$2,000 - C$3,000, so plan accordingly.

**What Interac Online Casino Sites Actually Offer**

The top Interac online casinos in 2025 typically provide:

1) **Thousands of slot titles and casino games.** Top sites offer 1,000–3,000 slots, with new releases weekly.

2) **Real-money blackjack, roulette, and baccarat.** Live dealers stream from studios, making the online experience feel like a brick‑and‑mortar venue.

3) **Banking in Canadian dollars with Interac e‑Transfer.** Deposits are often instant, and withdrawals can be processed via Interac e‑Transfer or other e‑wallets.

4) **Mobile apps or responsive websites.** You can play anywhere, whether you’re at home or on a coffee break.

**How I Find a Reputable Online Casino in Canada**

When I’m looking at new online casino **interac e transfer** sites, here’s my checklist:

1) **Licensing.** Curacao and Malta are common, but some players prefer Kahnawake or Ontario‑licensed sites.

2) **Real player reviews.** Reddit threads and forums give honest feedback on payout reliability and support.

3) **CAD banking options.** If the site doesn’t offer Interac or other CAD-friendly methods, it’s not worth my time.

4) **Track record.** How long has the casino served Canadian players? A new site might offer huge bonuses but could disappear overnight.

5) **Responsible gambling tools.** Self-exclusion and deposit limits are must-haves for safe play.

**Real Money Games Like Canadians Actually Play**

The best Interac casinos aren’t just about flashy slots (though those are fun). Here’s what’s popular right now:

1) **Online Slots.** Most Interac casinos focus heavily on slots. Titles from Play’n GO (fun features, solid RTP), Pragmatic Play (big jackpots, loads of choices), Microgaming (classics), and NetEnt (polished graphics) dominate the lobbies. Top sites often have 2,000+ slot titles.

2) **Table & Live Dealer Games.** You’ll find live blackjack with Canadian-friendly dealers, multiple roulette variants (European, American, Lightning), baccarat for all bankrolls, and often poker or video poker rooms.

3) **Specialty & Crash Games.** Some sites feature crash or instant-win games for quick adrenaline hits.

**Money Management at Interac Online Casinos**

This part matters more than the games themselves:

1) **Set deposit limits before you start.** Interac makes it easy to send money, so set a budget and stick to it.

2) **Stick to your bankroll.** Don’t chase losses — it never ends well.

3) **Use bonuses wisely.** Some sites have reasonable wagering, while others trap you. Read the terms before claiming.

4) **Think of it as entertainment.** Online gambling should be fun; treat any win as a bonus, not a paycheck.

**What Good Interac Casinos Do Right**

The best **online casino canada interac** platforms stand out because they:

1) Offer **support during Canadian hours.** Getting help at 3 a.m. matters.

2) Are **optimized for Canadian internet speeds.** Smooth play even in rural areas is a plus.

3) Have **CAD banking without hidden fees.** No conversion to USD or EUR.

4) Provide **mobile gameplay that doesn’t crash** on Telus, Rogers, or Shaw networks.

**Current State of Online Gambling in Canada**

Canada’s gambling market is shifting. Physical casinos are still busy, but more people are going online. Offshore casinos remain accessible, and the best real‑money sites are adapting to Canadian players’ needs. As long as you stick with licensed platforms and use trusted payment methods like Interac, you’re in decent shape.

**What Safe Interac Online Casinos Provide**

The most reputable Interac casinos in 2025 always include:

1) **Secure deposits and withdrawals in CAD.** Transactions are encrypted and backed by bank-level security.

2) **Transparent return-to-player (RTP) percentages.** Many providers publish RTPs, so you know game fairness.

3) **Responsible gambling tools.** Self-exclusion, deposit limits, and reality checks help keep things under control.

4) **Reasonable withdrawal times.** Interac e‑Transfer withdrawals usually take 1–3 business days after approval, sometimes faster if auto-deposit is enabled.

**Online Casino Experience vs Land-Based in Canada**

These days, the online experience often matches or surpasses physical venues:

1) **Better payout rates (RTPs).** Online slots can offer higher RTPs than land-based machines.

2) **No travel or parking costs.** Play in your pajamas if you want.

3) **24/7 access.** No need to wait for a seat at your favorite table.

4) **Comfort and privacy.** You control your environment and pace.

**Finding Your Match**

Not every **online casino interac payment** site is the same. Some excel at slots, others at live dealers or specialty games. Picking your best fit depends on:

1) **Game preferences.** Slots vs table games vs live dealers.

2) **Bonus style.** Some offer huge welcome bonuses; others reward loyalty.

3) **Banking needs.** Interac, credit card, crypto — choose what suits you.

4) **Preferred device.** Playing mainly on mobile? Make sure the interface works smoothly.

**Final Thoughts on Real Money Interac Casinos**

After years of playing, I’ve learned that the best Interac online casino isn’t always the flashiest. The platforms that stand out pay quickly, offer fair terms, and don’t mess players around.

Online casinos beat land-based options for convenience and variety. Start small, test withdrawals early, and see what fits your style. At the end of the day, gambling online in Canada should be fun. Set your limits, gamble responsibly, and enjoy yourself.

What about you? Have you found an Interac online casino that actually delivers? I’d love to hear how other Canadians are navigating the 2025 Interac casino landscape.

1nbo0xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1nbo0xh/does_this_genre_exist/,Does this genre exist,"I've been thinking of a genre for this book I was considering to write. But I'm not sure what the genre is, or is there any?

TLDR: What is (or is there) a genre for a book, that has various subjects interconnected together to make a book which could be described as some sort of book about opinions. All opinions would still be backed up with actual research and data. For example if one would say earth is round, it wouldn't be just that, there would be explanation of why the writer thinks that, what science backs that up in his mind and so on. And then the subject would someone smoothly switch to something else. Creating this book which tells the world ""This is me, I'm a nobody, this is what I think of stuff"". And nobody would probably buy it. What's the genre? Is it diary? Epistolary?

And then the longer form if anyone is interested:

So this book would be about someone completely random nobody explaining various subjects and how they see them? I'm not talking about some experienced scientist explaining how stars are formed. Not talking about a professional in computer sciences how artificial intelligence is going to cause lot of problems. But more like someone who you have never met sat next to you in a cafeteria and started telling you that capitalism is just a fancy word for slavery. And as you listen, it seems like this guy has some really good points, who is he, you've never met him, but it sure looks like he has made his research on the subject and has been thinking about this a lot.

But then suddenly you would realize that the topic has changed at some point. It's dark outside already, you've been so mesmerized about this mysterious nobody telling you about all sort of stuff and made you lose the track of time. The subject is not about world economics anymore, as the man is spilling words and the bartender brings yet another cup of coffee for the both of you, the subject is about artificial intelligence and how it's going to cause problems in the future that the world leaders fail to see. And you get to hear everything about why they fail to see it. Followed by a lot of questions, because this man doesn't know everything, he's just filling your head with these interesting topics and everything feels like it's the absolute truth. Feels like he's inside your head and so correct about everything. You wanna follow this guy to his home, like you were interconnected. The transitions between the subjects are so subtle, smooth and natural, you don't even notice them. It feels like one story, about universe, life, people and everything.

So all in all, this would be like a book of opinions about, well just about everything (not really everything, but a lot of stuff), but the point would be to smoothly transition from one topic to another so that you wouldn't really notice. From a completely random guy you have never ever met. Who isn't a professional of any kind in most of the matters he's telling you, but you still think he has good points.

I know celebrities write books about their life and definitely put their opinions in there. But they are celebrities, and if some celebrity sat next to you in that cafeteria, you would most likely listen as long as you could. Unless you dislike them obviously, but that's not the point. The point is, what is this genre? Or does it even exists? Do books have to contain just one general topic? Maybe it could be disguised as some fiction, but this world would be similar to ours. Yeah I guess that's the way it must go. Oh right, I had 3 hours sleep last night, maybe this doesn't even make sense.",0,1757338799.0,writing,10,0.2,False

**The tool is completely free to use, no signup, no login.**  
  
It restores the image without creating a new version which is quite different from how open ai does it. Most other restore photo ai tools will attempt to create a new photo. But this one, it cleans up the old photo but does not repair blemishes.

 The technology behind this is very impressive because it can work on damaged photos that are many years old. Sometimes the photos have scratches or they are faded from the time, but the AI can still make them look better. 

 However, if there are big damages or the photo is too much destroyed, then the AI cannot fix everything. But for normal wear and tear from age, it works very well.

 The process is also quite fast - usually takes only few minutes to complete the restoration.

On our way my brother insisted he needed a coffee, I was happy to comply. We found this coffee place called Cafficana just 1.5 km away from my home. I parked my scooter ahead of 2 other bikes. My brother went in to check their menu out. That's when this guy who works as a valet comes up and tell me I cannot park my two wheeler there cause then they wouldn't have space for a car. Inspite of two two wheelers parked on the side, they somehow didn't want a scooter parked up front. He asked us to park it outside the property, cause you know people who come in 4 wheeler are kings but people who actually use more eco friendly and economical means of transport aren't as welcome. It was a horrible experince. This is the most classist place I have ever come across in panambilly. And mind you I have been staying in that area for 1.5 years now. I hardly come across a place where they do not have a designated space for 2 wheelers. I guess this is how they keep the poor customers away. I do own a car, but decided against it in this traffic. But if this how they treat me, I wonder how they treat the poor.

I live in TN and am a homeowner of about two years. I don't have much equity in the house due to stagnation in local house prices.

Due to being laid off unexpectedly, my family has run up a huge amount of credit card debt.

I've thought about:

1. Refinancing my home and trying to include the credit cards in the mortgage so I have one payment
2. Taking out a personal loan and clearing the CCs. Again, the thought of having one monthly payment rather than 5 across different credit cards would be such a stress relief.

There might be other options I'm not considering. What are they? And what are your thoughts on ways to tackle this debt?

My spouse and I have committed to clearing the credit cards and getting rid of them. We'll spend using our debit card moving forward, and if we run out of money halfway through the month, so be it. This will teach us not to live by credit cards and will cut out overspending on barista coffees and takeouts.

Thanks for any guidance!

  
**EDIT:** I am no longer unemployed. I have a decent salary and may receive a pay increase soon, which will help give us some spare cash to put towards paying down debt. Right now, even with the good salary, there's no spare cash at the end of the month due to high monthly mortgage costs, car finance payments, and feeding my spouse and two kids.",0,1757338555.0,Debt,7,0.33,False

With AI-driven insights, you'll know exactly when to hit “post” to snag those eyeballs! Bye-bye, manual grind. 

3. **Personalized Content Recommendations**  
   AI isn’t just for writing and scheduling! Think about platforms that can analyze your audience’s behavior to suggest what they want next. **Guess what?** If you can give your audience what they crave, you’re basically a content magician. 🎩✨ Consider experimenting with tools like HubSpot for personalized email campaigns!

4. **Subscription Models & Memberships**

Most of my life I’ve experienced issues with eczema/dermatitis, asthma, hayfever, intermittent hives, intermittent wheezing, scalp itching even when using fragrance free products, sinus infections, post nasal drip, gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, flatulence, hiccups, burping/belching, heart burn, indigestion, constipation and diarrhoea), food intolerance to gluten and diagnosed with IBS after blood and biopsies initially indicated but didn’t confirm Coeliac Disease. I’ve had severe skin reactions to different things including perfumes, grass, cat scratches, moisturisers, cleaning products. Many fragrances give me migraines, make me wheeze and feel nauseous. 

I had allergy desensitisation treatment approx 12 or so years ago for cat, grass, dust mite and wild oats. I can’t drink coffee even decaf after I was having increasingly serious reactions to it. A caramel latte once put me in Emergency twice in the same day but at that time the doctors thought it was the caramel syrup causing the issue and not the coffee. I haven’t knowingly had coffee in 13 years now as reactions would range from an upset stomach to, migraines, wheezing, asthma attacks, itchy mouth, throat swelling, racing heart. 

I have been taking a H1 antihistamine daily for about 12 years now. If I go more than a day without taking an antihistamine my body feels like it’s been held over flames. 

A few weeks back I brought a new bottle of Cerave Moisturising Lotion to use as a face and all over moisturiser. I had been using their cream formula for the past year or so without any issues. Last weekend I started getting any itchy face, especially around my eyes, lips and nose. I just thought it was hayfever as the sun had finally made an appearance after a long wet winter. Over the past week my face had gotten increasingly red, swollen and now most of my body feels like it’s on fire. I have tiny hives almost everywhere. After speaking to a Pharmacist on Saturday night I added an extra H1 antihistamine a day, plus cold compresses to my face, avoided hot showers and have put nothing but water on my face since then. The antihistamines are helping a little but I’m still very uncomfortable and all but the smoothest fabrics feel prickly on my skin. 

I should also mention that I’m hypermobile and have symptoms of hEDS but no diagnosis as it’s difficult to get a diagnosis where I live due to shortage of Rheumatologists. I test 6/9 on the Beighton Scale despite having very limited range of motion in my neck due to also having congenitally fused C6/7 vertebrae. 

I can’t get in to see my GP until next week and I’ll be asking for a referral to an Allergist/Immunologist. I haven’t seen one since the allergy desensitisation treatment and at that stage MCAS and other immune issues were never explored. ",2,1757338371.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

For as long as I remember, I’ve never been able to dream. Well, that’s a lie I suppose – everybody dreams, it’s a vital part of the sleep cycle. A chance for your brain to renew itself and process the day, to take the raw data of existence and organise it into understanding. It’s not one to one, of course – anybody who claims that there are direct correlations between dreams and conscious experience are typically parroting Freud’s worst tendencies. No: you saying “You too” to a barista when she said to enjoy your coffee does not *cause* the nightmare of being chased by your babysitter while fully in the nude. Not directly at least. There are correlations, but nothing in that space is cut and dry.

It is far more accurate to say I’ve never been able to *remember* my dreams. This never bothered me in my childhood: I was prone to bouts of night terrors that would compel me to dash out of my room naked and lock myself in the bathroom, hoping whatever it was that assailed me would not be able to breach the door. Despite this mental turbulence, I was never able to know just what it is that my brain had cooked up that would frighten me so. It was gone as soon as I became lucid, and so my inability to remember was a blessing, perhaps my brain protecting me from its horror show.

Years passed, and I tended not to think about it. The night terrors faded, and as I reached adolescence they ceased entirely. An overactive mind, my parents claimed: something that with age would be smoothed off at the edges, nervous energy becoming motivation. That, and the medication that came with being prescribed ADHD in my mid-teens caused the night terrors to drip off me. Still, I never remembered, and did not care to. Not until I met my girlfriend.

She has insomnia, and a similarly overactive mind. But she remembers all of her dreams, is able to recount them hours after waking, something improved by her dream journal that she keeps on the bedside table. I usually brush off her stories in the cheeky way you do with someone you’re comfortable with. She would tell me them at breakfast, and maybe I’m just impatient, or my brain isn’t fully in at those times, but I would find myself getting hopelessly *bored*. A dream, of course, is only interesting if you’re the one who experienced it. Going on a dinner date with Peaches Geldof and your childhood dog would be a fantastic thing to have done, I am sure, but it makes for a poor story. The charm of the quasi-random elements that make up a dream become boring after a while, and the lack of any narrative flow or stakes makes is more as like to put me to sleep than it is interest me.

 

Still, I can’t pretend that it didn’t make me jealous. Just a tad, at first, but the feeling grew over time. It takes her a good while to doze off, and she tells me about what I’m like, fast asleep in the hours before she can settle. She tells me I always have a slight smile on my face, a satisfied grin. I don’t snore or fuss, but I do still talk in my sleep sometimes, fragments of conversations peek through to the outside world. Most of it gibberish, but my interest was piqued when she told me I’d been muttering about ‘Cuckoo’s Nook’.

That was the name of the house my grandparents lived in – way up north. They’d passed when I was very young, but I still remember my times there with the family; the way we’d all crowd around their dining table for Christmas, the smell of freshly baked bread, and my Grandma’s signature stew; something my mom (bless her) was never able to replicate.

Knowing that I was there, in that sacred place, made me feel like I was missing out in a way that never bothered me before. In the proceeding weeks, I attempted a host of techniques and tips to improve the memory of past dreams. I attempted a dream journal, which was of no use as I couldn’t remember anything to journal about. I tried going to bed on an empty stomach, on a full stomach, drinking heavily before bed, being sober. I tried setting alarms in the middle of the night, apparently this makes you have very vivid dreams when you settle off, but this didn’t work either (and was incredibly annoying to my girlfriend).

All these strategies I tried, with no result. I don’t know if the ‘Other Me’, the dream me, was enjoying dinner in Cuckoo’s Nook with my grandparents – and in a way it didn’t matter. *I* couldn’t remember a damn thing. If anything, I was starting to get intensely jealous of the dream me. He was having all the fun.

Eventually, out of boredom, and my obsessive need to tinker and create little devices, I started to experiment with other methods. I was past believing it would work now, but if anything, it was professional curiosity. After playing through a couple of ideas in my head, I had an idea. I bought a sleep mask online, one of those that has earphones in, so you can listen to a podcast in bed. I stripped it of its internal parts immediately – I had no need for the speakers, I just needed a headband that you could fit electronics into (and I’m hopeless with textiles anyway, let someone else do all the work on that front).

I’d been messing around with something akin to a shock collar, something that that could provide a jolt of electricity. Nothing dangerous mind, only something that could be powered by a couple of triple A batteries. My thinking was that I needed some way to jolt my consciousness awake, keep the brain somewhat active while crossing the threshold into REM sleep. Just a little zap, only as much as you’d get from a static shock, administered at regular intervals throughout the night – nothing fancy.

Like I say, I had no idea if this was going to work or not, I was in it for the thrill of the process. It took a few attempts, but eventually I figured out how to get it working, just a simple digital timer that I’d wired into a couple of shock pads I’d taken from a shock collar online. The output of the shock could be regulated, so I started it off on low, and tested it out by wearing it while awake. All seemed to work OK, so I tried it out proper that very same night.

The first night of attempts, nothing happened. I woke up as I normally do, and still could not remember anything at all. So, for the next week, I incremented up the output of the shock. Only a tiny amount, not enough to cause myself any damage, but enough that it may have an effect on my sleeping brain. And then, on day 5, it seemed to actually work.

I was there, In Cuckoo’s Nook. I could *smell* the food cooking – my grandmother’s signature stew. I could smell that fresh loaf of sourdough cooking in the oven, I could see her pots and pans, all hanging up on the walls. I could feel their large wooden dining room table as I’d run my hands across it. It was extendable, and they’d open it up fully when family were visiting – all of us would sit across from it for Christmas or a birthday. Now it was retracted, intimate. There was a plate out for myself, my grandmother and grandfather. I could hear rattling around in the kitchen – Grandad attempting to find matching cutlery out of the eclectic mix of silverware they had thrifted over their decades.

I had stood to go over to talk to them when my morning alarm went off. But I *remembered*. I remembered all of it. I rushed off out of my bed, half naked and almost tripping over myself with excitement, finding a piece of paper to write down what I dreamed. I had half a mind to call my girlfriend right there and then, to tell her of my wonderful invention, to tell her that it worked. I stopped myself before I could, suddenly embarrassed. She’d think me a madman, I thought; using a shock collar to zap myself all night. She’d worry about how safe it could be, and with good reason. Either way, she’d be sleeping and I wasn’t about to wake her when sleep is such a precious commodity. No – it would be best to try it out for a while, make sure that its entirely safe before telling her my news.

So, I kept it close to my chest, and went about my day as normal. When home from work, I took stock of my findings, recording everything in my notebook. I drew out complex diagrams of the workings of the device, its power source, the output of the shocks, the timings between applications. I noted it all down, made sure there was no way I could lose this information, and then, almost too excited to sleep, put the headband on and went to bed once more.

The next couple of nights were magical. I found myself in a host of different dreams, all exciting and interesting in the way that a dream could only be to the person that experienced it. I was in a rowing boat with my father, then at once on holiday to our little caravan, playing with the other kids at the playpark. I never got so far as flying, but my heart soared as if I was. Each morning I woke up, beside myself with glee and excitement, wishing I could drop asleep again right there and then. I also, privately, wished I could be back at Cuckoo’s Nook again – that I could spend a full dinner with my Grandparents. That dream did not reemerge until the fourth day.

I remember I was once again seated in their dining room. The familiar smells drifted back in, the stew, the sourdough. The sounds of cutlery clattering in its draw. I took a beat, just breathing in the atmosphere of it all, feeling *home.* Once again I ran my hands over the table, feeling the roughness along the grain of the unvarnished table. Something Grandad was going to get around to before he died. I then stood, and began walking to the kitchen, aching to see their faces once again.

 

 



***SNAP***

 

 

At once, all of the lights turned off, accompanied with an awful sound, a wrenching, tearing POP that sheared the senses in two. The sort of sound you hear when your eardrums burst; the sort of sound I imagined they would hear in a warzone, that is accompanied by a dreadful silence in which you contemplate if you will ever hear again. The sounds of clattering immediately ceased, as did the smells of sourdough and stew, all senses ripped away, all inputs null. The room was dark, pitch dark. I tried to shout out, but my words became caught in my throat, I tried to reach for the table but I felt nothing – not even a rush of air past the arms that would indicate any movement at all. I had no idea if I even had arms anymore, no idea if I was even in my body anymore. I floated there, a deep terror welling in my chest, making me feel light, a helium balloon expanding and stretching at its seams.

The silence continued, for some awful eternity, or maybe a second. I was screaming at myself in my head, gasping, aching to wake up, to be taken from this nightmare, to be able to run into my bathroom and lock the door, to lock myself in, sequestered away from this awful, awful nothingness. And just when I thought I could take it no more, I heard the creaking of those old wooden boards in Cuckoo’s Nook. The heavy footing of my grandad, the familiar shifting of weight as he stepped from his good leg to the bad one, the one riddled with polio, that he couldn’t move since he was five years old.

The creaking was becoming closer now, each whine of those old floorboards like some beautiful reassurance, that everything would be ok. He was right beside me now, I swear I could feel his breath on my face. And that voice, that voice that I have missed for so long, that I was worried I would one day forget entirely, said “*Power’s out”.*

 

I woke with a start, swallowing air rather than breathing it, choking on each inflow, forcing it down my throat as best as I could. I was in my room now once more, dark, but so much lighter than the void I was in before. And there was a heat, a burning heat on my temple. I reached up and snatched away the makeshift shock mask, burning my fingertips as I did so. I could smell textiles smouldering.

I flicked the light on. The shock mask was a mess. It looks like it somehow short circuited, or the batteries weren’t of good quality, or something. Either way, the thing was totally fried, the fabric smoking on either side of the band, the batteries kaput. I chastised myself, gently first, but increasing in intensity towards flagellation. *Stupid, stupid man. What were you thinking, shocking yourself, like some mad nazi doctor, like some fucking inventor. You could have killed yourself. IDIOT.*

 

I eventually came to, and went downstairs to make myself a coffee. I didn’t care what time it was, I wasn’t sleeping again now. If the dream wasn’t bad enough, blasting yourself directly to the brain is a surefire way to wake you up in the morning. That’d probably have been a smarter gadget idea. The battery must have fully discharged, directly between my temples. *A dangerous amount of power? Surely not.* It was only triple A batteries anyway. Probably more at risk from the burning than the electricity.

I drowned the sleep mask in the sink – stupid I know, but it was hot and I wasn’t fully there. I returned downstairs to grab my coffee, and was thankful for every feeling, every sense I could take in. I glided my hand down my banister as I walked, revelling in every detail of my landlord’s poor paint job, the flicks of dried bumpy paint that I privately seethed about. The sound of the floor beneath me, the ruffle of the rug beneath my bare feet. *The smell of stew and sourdough baking in the oven.*

NO. I thought. No, no no this isn’t right. I felt that balloon inflating once more inside me, felt the tension of neurons firing, muscles contracting into tight nervous knots. I threw myself at the kitchen door, hoping that it was just an aftereffect, that it was some half remembered echo of the night, I opened the door, and found myself in Cuckoo’s Nook once more, dark, quiet.

 

*Power’s out.*

 

I awoke in my bed once again, terror pounding my body like a wave. I just dreamt I’d waken up. Happens all the time. I’m just a bag of nerves. Overanxious mind. It happens. It was troubling all the same. I felt small, small in the way I felt as a child, locked into that bathroom, keeping the bad world out. I took some deep breaths but couldn’t quite pull myself together. That little voice in the back of your head. *How do you know you’re not dreaming now?*

But no, this was my house, I’m sure of it. I flicked the lights on. Power’s *not* out. The sleep mask was there, still smouldering on the bed. I looked at my hands, a clock, everything that looks ‘off’ when dreaming, pinched myself, went so far as banging my head on the wall. No, this time I was surely awake. Surely.

I went to the toilet to drown the sleep mark once more. I went in, and tried to flick on the light. The switch didn’t work. I was fiddling with it when I heard the familiar creak of my grandfather approaching, those old groaning floorboards.

 

*Power’s out.*

 

It was around the thousandth cycle when I decided to record my experience. For fifteen minutes I exist in the waking nightmare. It all feels so real, feels like you are there. Like the room is solid. Every detail. But after fifteen minutes, I am brought back to Cuckoo’s Nook once more, announced by the smell of sourdough, the creaking of floorboards.

 

*Power’s out.*

 

The details began drifting away after some time. I struggle to remember names, the name of my girlfriend, the names of my grandparents. I stopped referring to them by name some time ago. I need to write, write what I know, write enough that it becomes muscle memory, that I do not need to think when I type out my story.

 

*Power’s out.*

 

Other details are becoming lost to me now. I am used to these words, I have written them thousands of times, it makes up the sum total of my existence. That, and stew. And sourdough. I worry soon I will forget what it is to write at all, what the words mean, what they even are. But I continue, I continue in the hope that one day I will wake up, I will truly wake up, and to make sure that I cannot forget what I’ve been through, what I unearthed that should have been forgotten.

 

*Power’s out.*

 

As my inch of eternity grows, everything has begun to lost meaning. I have the script completed now – I can type it out in seven and a half minutes. I write it out, and send it off to anything I can think of, reddit, the newspapers, Facebook, Instagram. All muscle memory. An empty vessel, a parrot that speaks English though it doesn’t understand the words. It won’t mean much soon. I can’t forget. Overactive mind. Nervous energy, mustn’t forget.

 

 

*Power’s out.*

 

All I have left, all I wish I will be able to cling to, is my ability to count the number of cycles, the amount of times I have walked this path. I count it, each and every time. It started just as a reminder that time was progressing, that it was moving forward. Now, as all loses meaning, I hope that that is the only vestige of this decaying mind that may hold firm before I wake. There must be a record. I must remember.

 

*Powersout*

 

I don’t think I’m insane. Not yet. But when I do wake up, when the day breaks. Then. Then I think I will snap. THen I will lose what’s left. I’m so scared of waking up.

They did a good job with the architecture - very attractive modernist design with a nice pool. However the actual guest rooms are very underwhelming. There is no desk or chair; hot water took 5 minutes everytime to reach the bathroom, no coffee-maker in the room, and lack of lighting over the bathroom vanity made it impossible to shave or for the wife to put on makeup. Plus they seemed to be understaffed at breakfast every morning. Overall experience is meh considering the high cost. Won't return. ",1,1757338285.0,fredericksburgtexas,0,0.67,False

Back in February I was having a terrible day and decided to try this new coffee place near my work. When I walked in, the barista immediately smiled and said ""Hey Mike! The usual?"" I was so caught off guard and honestly just wanted my coffee without any awkward corrections, so I just nodded and said yes.

Turns out ""Mike"" apparently orders a medium oat milk cortado with an extra shot. It was actually really good so I just went with it. I figured it was a one time thing and I'd never go back.

But then the next week I was craving that exact coffee and went back. Same barista, same ""Hey Mike!"" and I just... went along with it again. Now its been 8 months and I'm full blown ""Mike"" at this place. They know my ""usual,"" ask about my weekend plans, and last month they even gave me a free coffee on what they thought was my birthday (it wasn't).

The worst part is I've actually become friends with some of the staff. There's this guy Jake who works mornings and we chat about everything. He thinks my name is Mike and has shared so much personal stuff with me. I feel like such a fraud but I'm also genuinely invested in his life now. He told me about his breakup last month and I actually worried about him all day.

I've put aside a little money from a thing online thinking I should eventually give them a big tip and come clean, but how do you even explain this? ""Hey sorry I've been lying about my name for almost a year because I was too awkward to correct you that first day?""

The coffee shop has become this weird safe space where I can just be ""Mike"" - who apparently is more confident and social than regular me. Real me would never strike up conversations with strangers, but Mike chats with other customers and even helped this woman with her laptop once.

I know I need to either stop going there or tell them the truth but honestly both options make me want to cry. This sounds so pathetic but this coffee shop and these people have become such a bright spot in my routine.

I just needed to tell someone because I feel like I'm living this bizarre double life over a freaking cortado.",34,1757338188.0,offmychest,7,0.97,False

Hey folks! I’m so energized by what’s happening in the automation space—you can feel fresh breezes blowing through our days as ""no code automation"" takes the slog out of, well, pretty much everything repetitive! The power to automate entire workflows with a few clicks or drag-and-drop stacks? Yes, please!

Let’s be honest: not so long ago, if you wanted a process automated, you’d either have to dust off your JavaScript books or negotiate with your dev team for the millionth time. Now, with all these no code platforms, you can build automations for:

- Sending emails and Slack alerts
- Updating spreadsheets in real time
- Connecting your favorite apps like Trello, Airtable, Notion, and Google Calendar
- Even handling data flows and chatbots

All with *literally zero* need to write or debug a single line of traditional code.

What does this mean for us—indie makers, small teams, curious experimenters? FREEDOM! Creativity before credentials. You dream it, and with tools like Zapier, Make/Integromat, GPT Apps, or Pipedream, you *see* it come together before your eyes.

And the happiness of hitting “run” on your first automation and watching the bots do the work—it’s joyful! You save time (hours, not minutes), reclaim dull afternoons, and get to focus on building, exploring, or even just taking that deserved coffee break.

Of course, I know some people worry that “no code” might be too basic or limiting. Here’s the cool twist: most platforms are adding pro-level features like API calls, conditional logic, variables, and yes, even AI-in-the-loop for natural language tasks! 

Here’s what I love most:  
- **Democratizes tech:** Anyone, regardless of background, can become a developer of their own life
- **Fast prototyping:** Ideas aren’t chained to developer cycles—you spin them up in an afternoon!
- **Empowers small businesses:** You get scalable systems without breaking the bank

But let’s get real: I also see wild opportunities ahead. Imagine what happens when no code, automation, and AI combine. Picture filling out a simple form, and then—boom!—your tool not only analyzes your request but also stitches together multiple platform automations *and* suggests helpful tweaks.

We are *so close* to workflows that can genuinely “think” along with us. It makes me super excited for what tomorrow will bring!

Curious—what has been your proudest/most surprising automation with no code tools? Do you foresee any challenges when everything is automatable? If you haven’t tried these tools yet, what’s stopping you?

Last month, I did an out-and-back to Colorado Springs (IND to DEN and back). This month was a quick solo overnight to Orlando. I’m 47, single, and an empty nester. These quick solo trips are becoming a fun way to reset without overcommitting time or money.

PLANNING

This one came together fast.
* Thursday at 12:01 AM, I booked a one-way flight from IND to MCO for Friday evening.
* Friday at 12:01 AM, I booked the return leg, reserved a hotel, and debated whether to rent a car. I decided against it. 

More on that below.

PACKING

I packed light with my Osprey Daylight 35L, which fits Frontier’s personal item size if it’s not overstuffed. The first seven items are always kept in my travel backpack:
* GoRumpl blanket (packs down small and doubles as a travel wrap or beach blanket)
* Blackout eye mask
* TRTL neck pillow
* AirPods
* Anker power bank and spare charging cables
* Pill organizer
* Nylon hanging toiletry bag with duplicate travel-sized items
* One pair of sneakers
* Bathing suit
* Two tank tops and one skirt
* Travel outfit (long pants and a zip-up jacket)
* Baseball cap
* Underwear and socks


FRIDAY - DEPARTURE

After work, I sped to the airport but got stuck in downtown traffic. I had planned to park in the economy lot to save money but ran out of time and had to park in the covered garage instead.
Parked at 5:36pm
Breezed through TSA PreCheck.

At the gate, agents were asking travelers to measure their bags. One woman had wheeled luggage that was just over the limit. As the agent got distracted, she slipped through and boarded anyway.
If you fly Frontier, you probably already know that most of the plane gets called for Zone 1. Since I always plan to put my bag under the seat, I prefer to be among the last to board. It helps avoid the crowd and stress.

Boarded at 5:53pm, landed at MCO at 8:26pm.

After landing, I walked to the rideshare pick-up area and saw Lyft was cheaper than Uber. I took a Lyft to Disney Springs for $35.90.

HOTEL

I stayed at Holiday Inn, booked through Expedia using $41.23 in OneKeyCash. After taxes and the resort fee, the total came to $109. They do charge a $39 resort fee at check-in, which I think is unnecessary. I asked if they could waive it since I was leaving early the next morning, but they said no.

After checking in, I walked toward Disney Springs (9:23pm). It was a 10-minute walk along a well-lit and safe sidewalk. The path is heavily trafficked with tourists and families, which makes it feel even safer, especially when traveling solo.

EVENING AT DISNEY SPRINGS

First stop was dinner at Polite Pig. I love brisket, and theirs is top-tier. I had a full meal with a drink and spent some time people-watching. Live music was playing throughout the area, and I had even come across a salsa dancing concert that had drawn a crowd.

After dinner, I walked over to Gideon’s Bakehouse. The line was about 20 minutes, which is reasonable compared to the hour I waited last time. The cookies were for my 20-year-old son, currently in college. They’re expensive, but worth it. 

These trips are as much for me as they are for him.

It was about 11pm when I decided to head back to the hotel. The crowds were starting to shift more toward adults and away from families. After a shower, I went straight to bed.

SATURDAY

I woke up early and realized I had used the last of my travel toothpaste the night before. The hotel had a pharmacy vending machine, so I bought a replacement tube for $6.99.

I had some complimentary coffee in the lobby, checked out the pool, and noticed it was already open. I went back to my room, changed, and spent the next two hours by the pool. It was quiet and relaxing. A few families were out early, and I watched some dads playing in the water with their kids while I read and enjoyed the morning sun.

By 10:15, I went back to the room to change, pack up, and check out.

I walked back to Disney Springs and went straight to Homecomin. It’s usually busy, but bar seating is open and easy. I had a morning cocktail and breakfast while enjoying the conversations around me and watching the world go by. The bill came to $46.80.

After brunch, I walked through some of my favorite stores like Sephora, Free People, Anthropologie. I took photos of some outfits I liked, but since I fly Frontier and avoid baggage fees, everything stayed on the rack.

My final stop was Amorette’s Patisserie for a Bailey’s iced coffee and a crème brûlée ($23.40). I sat outside, relaxed, and enjoyed the last moments of a sunny Florida day.

At 12:55 PM, I called a Lyft and was back at MCO by 1:25. TSA PreCheck was fast, and I had plenty of time before boarding.

EXPENSE SUMMARY

* Flights: $30.62
* IND Parking: $23.00
* Hotel: $109.00
* Uber to DS: $35.99
* Uber from DS: $29.87
* Polite Pig: $34.86
* Gideon’s: $19.70
* Homecoming’ $46.81
* Unplanned/Toothpaste: $6.99
* Unplanned/Amorette’s: $23.43

* Planned: $312.62
* Actual: $361.27
* Over Budget: $48.67

Was this trip necessary? No.
Was it fun and totally worth it? Absolutely.

Traveling solo to a place like Disney Springs might sound unusual, but it’s actually perfect. It’s safe, there’s tons to do, and it’s designed for families, which makes solo travelers stand out less than in other tourist destinations.

1nbnpsj,https://i.redd.it/qlw0v4o50ynf1.png,Do people really think that Cecil did nothing wrong or is that just a joke?,"I'm just curious cause this fandom,a lot of times, can be lowkey a bit emotionally abusive to Mark at times and especially were regarding the conflict when he had genuine and justified reasons to be upset.
""Oh he has no right to be upset, he's just being emotional""
Sinclair literally tortured numerous people and almost did the same to his close friend since high school. 
This is very personal for him + Darkwing II killed numerous thugs and randos + nearly killed him all cause he was Nolan's son. 

This is basically if you're a Police officer and you dealt with 2 highly dangerous criminals who are not only insane but nearly killed you and hurt your loved ones and your boss,The Chief says that they'll go to jail but instead are basically rewarded with a Gun and a badge of their own.

I think anyone would be genuinely upset and too claim that Cecil ""doesn't have to tell Mark anything"" is wild considering They're gonna be running to Mark and needing his help for whatever threat they'll have to face in the future. 

You don't even have to give him authority but a genuine heads up and conversation over coffee about it would've just cleared things up and made things better.
You guys are basically saying that Mark is old enough to where he has to nearly die for others but not old enough to where he shouldn't be involved with matters that concern him, which is a very American way of thinking. 

Plus the amount of people who say Mark ""threw the first punch"" is insane cause I rewatched the scene and Mark doesn't even lay a finger on Cecil once during their talk.

Mark doesn't even do..well,anything until the Reanimates come out and even then, he doesn't consider doing crap until one of them grabs him.

Cecil brought those out as a means to threaten/intimidate Mark into following his orders but that clearly doesn't work on someone like Mark. 
.
At most, he was arguing and talking back but it really doesn't help that Cecil was being a manipulative slimeball by throwing his moment with Angstrom back in his face as a Gotcha to control him.

Again, this is Mark we're talking about.
He was talking back and being stubborn like every angry teenager but when the heck has he ever gone from Arguing/shouting to straight up murder and violence towards not only regular people but also on someone who wasn't fighting back?

Mark literally was just making empty threats, he wasn't actually gone do anything. 
The smart thing would've been to just call his bluff and go to get lunch or do work in his office or something. 

Heck ,he could've just pulled up 2 chairs for them to genuinely talk about things and explain his past and how he got his scar and make it clear that they're only gonna be used limited and that they'll be under constant watch and won't hurt others again and actually say you understand his frustration. 

Or hell, Cecil could've just lied through his teeth to get Mark to leave if he really wanted him to go.

But he chose to surround him with zombie corpse robots cause he just wanted Control and was trying to achieve that through means of intimidation and threats + manipulation.

when Mark dealt with the first batch of Reanimates, that should've been Cecil's call to stop using brute force since it's clearly not gonna work out for him and use words but he continues to use more Reanimates as a way to get him to stand down and continue to threaten him.

Then he busts out a torture device he implanted in his body without his consent as a means like a shock collar to get Mark to comply and when Mark tries to leave to do the reasonable thing and get the weapon out, Cecil basically hunts him down and continues to torture him with said weapon. 

All this weapon shows to Mark is that Cecil was lying about him not being his father and that he never trusted him at all.

Mark trusted Cecil and he repaid that by stabbing him in the back and putting a weapon inside him without his consent or knowledge. 

People say Cecil shouldn't blindly trust Mark but that's very different from having no basic human trust in him at all.

Mark has been through too much since his late teens to not even deserve basic human trust and respect and by revealing that weapon in him, you basically showed that no matter how good you are and your intentions are that he'll still weaponize you and see you as nothing more then tools.

Mark is very different from Nolan cause Nolan never sacrificed himself or got damaged the same way Mark did.
+ Mark literally stood up to Nolan(his father of 17 years,mind you)to defend this planet and actively has refused to let the Atlantic people die and even refused to lie to Anissa. 

That goes beyond playing the long game, that shows he genuinely wants to help others and protect Earth but Cecil's paranoia and trauma + need for Control regarding Nolan refuse to separate the 2. 

Cecil couldn't control Nolan and it pisses him off that he can't put a leash on Mark and that makes him uncomfortable. 

Then when Mark gets to the Guardians, Cecil continues to torture him the minute Mark refused to go back to the Pentagon and he basically has his zombie corpse robots he was losing control over beat the life out of him until the frequency stopped.

If you prefer Cecil over Mark and all that ,fine but don't act like Mark didn't have genuine reasons to be angry and upset and that Cecil was some helpless little victim the entire time.

Cecil has a point to use villains and maybe have contingencies on the off chance of mind control but he's also the definition of creating his own problems he was trying to avoid cause he's a extraordinarily untrustworthy and untrusting Jerk with control and paranoia issues and a Ego problem. 

I talk about it a lot and I'm sorry but that is always going to be one aspect that bothers me.",21,1757338014.0,Invincible_TV,18,0.92,False

1nbnoqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1nbnoqv/am_i_overthinking_this/,Am I overthinking this?,"My house is about a month away from going live on Airbnb. I travel for work, living in an RV, and my home is near the beach in a vacation / touristy area. There are quite a few airbnbs in the area, a couple on the same street, and they all seem to be doing well, staying pretty booked throughout the year. 


I’m struggling with looking at this home from a guests perspective. I look at it and notice some flaws. Shower could be better, maybe I should’ve bought some different furniture, I should’ve painted the patio a different color, I have an island table as the dining room table but it can only fit 4 chairs- not the 6 the house sleeps, windows could use replacing, the laundry is in the garage, etc.


I bought new couches, new beds, new mattresses, all new linens and towels, new curtains, new pots and pans sets, flatware, beach towels, new keurig coffee pot, spices and oils, board games, TVs in each bedroom, front door keypad lock, luggage racks, wooden hangers for the closets, outdoor camera overlooking the front door / garage, new propane grill for the patio and a picnic table for outdoor dining (that does fit 6.) Hired a professional photographer for listing photos, got the exterior pressure washed, and have a cleaning service coming for a very thorough deep clean. I can’t afford to really do more right now until I start getting bookings. I’d like to add some beach toys / chairs, and a playpen / crib, probably get bigger / fluffier couches (even though I just bought these 2, literally haven’t even been sat on yet.) I have a nice fridge but the water / ice dispenser on the door doesn’t work (repair guy says I need to replace the whole fridge) but I just can’t afford it right now. So there will be a case of water in the fridge and full ice trays in the freezer. I’m going to leave snacks and sunscreen in the welcome basket. 


I pretty much took the chance on STR and Airbnb working out, I spent a couple thousand in savings furnishing and upgrading this place. This isn’t a new construction home I bought specifically for Airbnb. It’s my home. And while it’s good enough for me I really want to make sure it’s good enough for families on vacation who are paying me to stay here. 


I’ve been using Airbnb for over 5 years, but this is obviously my first time hosting.

It’s a smaller town. Not many people here. Those that are all are highschoolers. Some cute girls here and there but there’s not many opportunities. And if there are it’s like “oh shit i gotta approach THIS one. And not mess it up”

HOWEVER… I’m a 1 hour train ride from manhattan NYC

I work remote in coffee shops anyway….

Here’s the 2 thoughts going through my mind & tell me if it’s BS:

1. CT: Where I live is a smaller area but if I DO see a girl and approach it can definitely be successful because it’s so rare for them. And there local. 

2. NYC: if I go here I’ll get so much more volume but I’m not sure if the quality is the same. Because they know there’s 1M guys. Also they are far away for me. But I can do that 

Curious what you would do if you were me. Just say screw it and stay in your local coffee shops. Or travel far to see more woman. Even if there out of reach almost for dates",1,1757337919.0,PickUpArtist,1,1.0,False

I'm 32 and still living at home with my parents. My plan had always been to move in with a partner, but two relationships ended, so that never happened. I now have a stable full-time job (Monday to Friday, 9–5:30), and while my day-to-day life is pretty routine, I can't shake the feeling that I’m just coasting through life.

After work, I usually go home, make dinner, shower, and either read or watch TV before bed. On my lunch break, I eat with colleagues and go for a 30-minute walk while listening to a podcast. My weekends are usually spent at home with my parents and our dog — reading, watching sports or TV, and relaxing.

One thing worth mentioning is that my mum is genuinely my best friend. We spend a lot of time together, and I'm very grateful for that closeness. Still, sometimes I wonder if staying home this long has made me too comfortable or cautious.

My current partner is very introverted. He works evenings and weekends in a pub and prefers staying in and playing video games, so our schedules and lifestyles are quite different. I have friends, but most are in relationships, have kids, or are travelling, so I don’t see them often.

I used to love going out partying and drinking on weekends, but I don’t enjoy it as much anymore — I hate the hangovers, and it doesn’t really appeal like it used to. I also avoid going out for coffee or treats because I’m trying hard to save money with the goal of eventually buying or building a home.

I’m not unhappy, and I do enjoy my own company, but I often feel like I’m not really achieving anything. Life feels very static — like I’m in this weird limbo where everything is fine on the surface, but lacking any real momentum.

Has anyone else felt this way? How do you bring a sense of purpose or progress back into your life when you’re not struggling exactly, but still feel kind of lost or stuck?",4,1757337850.0,Life,10,1.0,False
1nbnn9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1nbnn9c/review_004_makers_mark_hsb_mocha_3/,Review 004 - Maker’s Mark HSB Mocha #3,"https://preview.redd.it/vdwadojkzxnf1.jpg?width=1848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dad2687f0df2ff0530251d967ee861f9b7ad8148

**The Acquisition:** Another solid recommendation from my buddy Mike, who’s been batting close to a thousand lately. Picked it up at Haskell’s in White Bear Lake, one of their annual store picks that’s earned a loyal following.

**Cost:** $72.99, reasonable for the proof and the uniqueness of the stave profile.

**Why’d I buy it:** Mike’s nudge, plus the story he told me resonated. Evidently Haskell’s has sold out of this pick three years running, and even though it uses a retired stave, Maker’s agreed to keep producing it exclusively for them. That kind of local legacy was hard to ignore.

**Bottle Details:** ABV-112.3; NAS, but presumably 6 to 7 years; 10 Mocha staves (Mocha staves were retired, but apparently, they are high heat and high toast staves, producing chocolate/toffee notes).

**Nose:** Subtle mocha, front and center. It leans into coffee liqueur and hot chocolate territory. Reminiscent of a spiked hot chocolate.

**Palate:** The mocha carries through, joined by a touch of brown sugar. It’s subtle, not overpowering, which makes it surprisingly enjoyable. There’s restraint, so it works. This dram was very nostalgic to me. The flavor reminded me of a dessert my late mom used to make for me, caramel bars. They were a cookie bar with a soft oatmeal cookie crust, filled with chocolate chips and caramel. They were my all-time favorite.

**Finish:** Once the mocha fades, the oak steps in. Long, pleasant, and warming. A truly enjoyable finish.

**Final Thoughts:** This is a bottle I’d keep on the shelf, especially for those long Minnesota winters. It’s not flashy, it’s just good. I can imagine sipping on this next to the fireplace at night. Mike at Haskell’s has picked another winner.

**Morning after glass sniff (This is a ritual I swear by, and if you haven’t tried it, you’re missing out.):** Still mocha-forward, but softer and sweet. The brown sugar lingers, and there is no oak.

**Score: 8.3**

**Scale (I would not buy anything under 8 a second time):**

1 Harsh, disappointing, and hard to finish.

2 Confused and off-course.

3 Hints of character, but obscured by flaws.

4 Neither bold nor balanced; lacks direction; mixer.

5 Shows promise, but still figuring itself out; decent mixer.

6 Reliable and well-made; not thrilling.

7 Flavorful, balanced, but not worth repurchasing unless the price is right.

8 Distinctive and memorable; rich in character and worth a permanent spot on the shelf.

9 Bold, complex, and exciting. A pour that surprises and delights with each pour.

10 Transcendent. A rare bottle that sets a new standard and leaves a lasting impression.

**About me:** For years, I focused on Scotch, with a focus on peated smoky expressions, exploring its depth and character one sip at a time. Tequila made a brief appearance at the recommendation of my cousin, but never took root in my heart. In April 2025, something shifted. I started contemplating what I had been missing in bourbon, rye, and American whiskey. Since then, I’ve been tasting, learning, paying attention and having fun, not just with what’s in the glass, but to the people, places, and experiences surrounding my adventures. I’ve spent time in small shops, asked questions, and built relationships with folks who have come to understand my taste and helped me appreciate that my preferences are vastly different than most. Some bottles are straightforward, others more complex, and a few surprise me each time I try them. My notes aren’t just about flavor. They’re about how each pour fits into a moment, a mood, or a memory. The whiskey is part of it, but the story is what makes it an adventure for me. — ***Captain Otter***",6,1757337834.0,bourbon,0,1.0,False

1nbnlfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedItRatedIt/comments/1nbnlfv/explore_if_the_best_earbud_headphones_shure_se535/,Explore if the Best Earbud Headphones Shure SE535 Live Up to the Hype,"Testing the Shure SE535-CL earphones gave me the feeling that I had upgraded to a professional-grade audio experience. These earphones, featuring triple high-definition drivers, blew me away with their clarity and rich bass. I’ve tested my fair share of earbuds and headphones, but plugging these in transported me to a sound realm that revealed intricate musical details I'd never noticed before. That being said, they aren’t without their quirks, which might be worth considering depending on your preferences, needs, or general patience levels.

**Design and Comfort**  
The transparent design of these earphones is striking, making the internal components visible, which adds a subtle but unique aesthetic. As someone who often struggles to find a comfortable fit in earbuds, I appreciated the inclusion of three earbud sizes (small, medium, and large) with flex and black foam sleeves. I had to experiment to find the best size for me—medium foam turned out to offer maximum comfort. Once fitted, the over-the-ear wire design locked them into place. Whether I was sprinting to catch a bus, nervously pacing during a meeting, or just jogging at the park, they stayed secure, which is a rare win for me.  
[Check Shure SE535-CL price on Amazon.](https://beatpops.com/p/b003nsbksw/)

**Performance and Sound Quality**  
These earphones deliver full-range sound powered by triple balanced armature drivers, and I could feel it with every note and beat. The output was smooth, rich, and free from distortion, even at higher volumes. Compared to my usual Bluetooth earbuds, the depth of the bass was unbeatable. Songs I’ve heard a hundred times suddenly felt new. Listening to Daft Punk or orchestral tracks was an auditory treat. However, these earphones lean toward neutrality, which might not satisfy bass enthusiasts looking for an overpowering low-end punch.

**Noise Isolation Capability**  
One standout feature is the sound isolation. I tested these on the morning commute, tuning into my playlist while surrounded by screeching train wheels and chatty commuters. The noise around me faded into the background—almost like someone switched on ""mute"" for life. That level of isolation comes down to both the snug fit and the passive sound isolation technology. They’re also perfect if you need to focus in noisy environments, like busy coffee shops or open offices.

**Pros**  
- Exceptional sound clarity with balanced mid, high, and low frequencies  
- Customizable earbuds for a snug fit  
- Superior noise isolation  
- Durable and lightweight  
- Detachable cables for easy replacement  

While the strengths are impressive, there are certainly aspects to think through before purchasing.

**Limitations**  
- Pricey compared to other models with similar specifications  
- Lacks ANC (Active Noise Cancellation), relying solely on passive noise isolation  
- The detachable cable connectors feel a little stiff; it took me a while to adjust them comfortably  

**Carrying Case and Accessories**  
I was happy to find the earphones came with a durable cloth carrying case. It's not a hard shell like some models provide, but it gets the job done for basic portability. The additional adapters and accessories felt like a thoughtful touch, ensuring I could use these with multiple devices like my laptop, smartphone, and audio interface.

**Direct Competitors**  
While testing these earphones, I couldn’t help but compare them to the Sennheiser IE 500 Pro and Audio-Technica ATH-E70, which fall into a similar price range. The Shure SE535-CL have better durability and slightly better noise isolation than the Audio-Technica model but lack the bass emphasis that some may prefer in the Sennheiser alternative. On the other hand, the IE 500 Pro felt more fragile when I handled them, which is where the Shure SE535's build quality felt reassuringly superior.

**Worth Every Penny**  
I have to admit, these earphones cost more than I anticipated spending initially. However, after testing their performance and features, it became clear why they sit at a premium price point. They’re ideal for professionals or dedicated audiophiles who want unparalleled sound quality. Still, if casual listening is your goal, it might make sense to explore more budget-friendly alternatives.

⚠️ Trigger Warning

This is the weekly recap of the monetized posts from Kylea and Joseph ""Joe"" Gomez of Kylea G, You Grow Girl from 08/22/25-08/28/25.  

Disclaimers: I am not a physician, influencer, or paid content creator.  I am not affiliated with WW.  I have no background in law; however, I am semi-retired from the healthcare field with multiple college degrees.  These opinions are my own based on social media content.  I wish no harm to Kylea & Joe Gomez or Kylea's legal team.

👋 everyone!  Let's take a peek into Kylea's busy week...

Takeout & Shopping 

08/22 Kylea got a pedicure; she announced they will decorate 2 small Christmas trees in a Grinch theme for their entertainment center; Hobby Lobby: shopping cart full of fall home decor; announced she will decorate for fall today instead of waiting until Sep.; Kirklands: new wall decor 

08/23 Chick-fil-A nugget tray for family meal; Glitter freckles for the Jonas Brothers concert; Hobby Lobby: additional fall decor

08/24 New blanket for accent chair by master bedroom

08/25 Pineapple Bliss for Kylea; Manicure, sparkly skirt for the concert & Kali Rose Boutique top for Kylea

08/26 Boutique top for Kylea 

08/27 The Human Bean ""smoothie"" for Kylea; Aldi: 4-pack of Gilmore Girls reusable coffee cups

*This week was full of decor & items Kylea didn't purchase & an announcement they will go with the flow for dinners on Sundays.

Travel

08/22 Joe came home at 1:00 am from his 
Thuggish-Muggish-Mafia Tour featuring Bone Thugs-N-Harmony concert at the Walmart Amp in Rogers, AR and went to work a few hours later.  Kylea would not reveal what concert he attended...

*This week, there were multiple reminders about the Colorado trip and Jonas Brothers concert.

Pets, Family & Religion

08/23 A Facebook Story was posted of Birdie playing with her squeaky chicken; UNdisclosed family (not shown) allegedly came over for Chick-fil-A 

08/24 Kylea allegedly went to church alone.  There was no mention of Joe attending the late service.

08/27 In my opinion, the ""My Best Friend Has 4 Paws"" Facebook Story was alarming due to Birdie not physically reacting to being petted or having her paws manipulated, while taking a nap on the couch.  This increased suspicion amongst snarkers that the dog is medicated. 

*This week= No video content was posted of Birdie on a walk, playing with her puzzles/ball pit or swimming pool.  The cats, Alice & Oliver, were not shown in images or on video, and there were ZERO posts dedicated to them.

Health & Fitness

08/23 Kylea posted a video about her self-worth being more than weight loss BUT frequently reminded her audience about her weight loss...

08/24 She posted an odd video dancing in her nightgown with a broom in her living room with Joe lying on the couch in the background. 

08/26-08/27 Increased discussion about her seasonal allergies resulting in an alleged medical visit 08/27 for the issue.

*This week= No images or videos of Joe at the gym were posted; no walking pad content was shared; no content was shared showing Kylea on a walk to elevate her heart rate

Final Thoughts 

In my opinion, Kylea was in the mood to argue this week about her back patio being a ""front porch"", why she likes to be barefoot in dressing rooms, and not asking for advice on what she should eat in her own home.  She was condescending and rude.  The best part of the week was her alleged 24 hr Facebook restriction, resulting in ZERO posts on 08/28/25!!! She could post a story and reply to comments on previous posts, but this punishment was perfect karma for her attitude. 🙌 

☎️ If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, please call or text 988 for assistance.  Please speak with a medical professional about any questions or concerns you have about your health.  Please contact a veterinarian about any questions or concerns you have about your pet(s).

Rehashing and expanding a post I made a few years ago. Many people wisely choose to skip renting a vehicle in winter and base themselves out of Reykjavík. A tour is good for people who haven't rented a vehicle or are uncomfortable driving around in the dark during winter. The guides and drivers are experienced with Iceland roads and weather. They will get you out and about safely. Many tours will help you with your camera settings so that you can get the best photos, or take photos for you. Tours are roughly 3-5 hours, weather dependent, and depart later in the evenings, often at or after 21:00 / 9:00 p.m. Definitely read all details for any tour you book, especially if you are bringing kids.

**I invite the locals who participate here and who are licensed to give tours in Iceland to add their information here!** I will then edit this top post and add your information so then people who are looking for a tour can find you. I know there are a few of you but I am too lazy to dig around for all of your info. Put your website/socials, website booking info, etc.

1nbnimv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_not-awkward/comments/1nbnimv/how_i_beat_social_anxiety/,How I beat Social Anxiety,"If you've ever felt your heart race before walking into a room full of people or dreaded small talk so much you thought about skipping the event altogether—you're not alone. I went through this for majority of my life and it SUCKS. Social anxiety affects millions of people, and while it can feel isolating, it's something you can learn to manage and overcome. I know because I have done it.  
  
This isn't about ""just being confident"" or ""getting over it."" Social anxiety is real, and it takes time, patience, and practical strategies to work through. The good news? With small, consistent steps, you can build confidence and feel more at ease in social situations. **It took me years to learn the things I am going to share with you below so that you can reduce your social anxiety even faster than I did.**  
  
**What Is Social Anxiety?**  
  
[Social anxiety is more than just shyness](https://notawkward.app/articles/do-i-have-social-anxiety). It's an intense fear of being judged, embarrassed, or rejected in social situations. You might:  
  
• Rehearse conversations in your head before saying anything.  
• Worry for days about a simple meeting or party.  
• Avoid situations altogether because the stress feels overwhelming.  
  
Sound familiar? If so, know that you're not broken—you're just human. And there are ways forward.  
  
**Practical Strategies to Beat Social Anxiety**  
  
**1. Challenge the ""What Ifs""**  
  
Social anxiety loves to whisper worst-case scenarios: ""What if I say something dumb?"" or ""What if they think I'm boring?""  
  
When those thoughts come, pause and ask yourself:  
• What's the evidence this will actually happen?  
• Have I survived similar situations before?  
  
Chances are, your mind is exaggerating. Reality is almost always kinder than our anxious imagination.  
  
**2. Start Small (and Celebrate Wins)**  
  
You don't have to give a TED Talk tomorrow. Begin with little things—making eye contact, smiling at a cashier, or saying hello to a coworker. Every small win is progress, and over time, these moments build up your confidence. Try to challenge yourself to do one thing each day that you find difficult. The more you do them, the more comfortable it will become! When I was at my worst, it was so hard for me to even just go up to the counter at Starbucks and order a coffee. I would practice what I was going to say over and over in my head before I went up there.  
  
**3. Breathe Through the Nerves**  
  
When anxiety hits, your body reacts—racing heart, sweaty palms, shallow breathing. Counter this with slow, deep breaths. Try inhaling for 4 counts, holding for 4, and exhaling for 6. This signals your nervous system that you're safe. Focusing on and controlling my breathing has been one of the most effective strategies that helped me beat social anxiety. I use it to this day if I ever start to feel anxious about anything and it works every single time.  
  
**4. Shift the Spotlight**  
  
PSA: No one thinks about you more than you. Most of us think everyone is analyzing us, but the truth is—people are usually focused on themselves. Instead of worrying about how you come across, get curious about the other person. Ask questions, listen, and let the pressure lift off you. People LOVE talking about themselves and if you need help coming up with conversation starters and questions, here are a few from the Not Awkward app:  
  
""What's been the highlight of your week so far?""  
""What's been the most interesting thing you've learned this semester?""  
or even something as simple as— ""how is your day treating you so far?""  
  
**5. Reframe Social Situations**  
  
The next time you have a social event to go to try this: instead of labeling them as threats, see them as opportunities. A networking event isn't a test—it's just a chance to meet one or two interesting people. A party doesn't need you to perform—it just needs your presence.  
  
**6. Consider Professional Support**  
  
Sometimes, the best way forward is with guidance. Therapy, coaching, or support groups can give you tools to navigate anxiety faster and with less struggle. Talking it through doesn't mean you're weak—it means you're ready to grow.  
  
Beating social anxiety isn't about becoming an extrovert (I have never been one or ever will be) or never feeling nervous again—after all, you are still human. It's about learning to manage your social anxiety so it no longer controls your choices. Progress may feel slow, but every conversation you have, every room you walk into, every moment you stay instead of leaving—that's a win.  
  
You don't need to be perfect to be accepted. You just need to show up as yourself—and that's more than enough.

So, I follow this big YouTuber who shares their daily puzzle list every single day. The problem? It's always a link to a super ugly Pastebin. It just felt wrong. That, plus my own bookmark bar was turning into a disaster zone of Wordle clones, so I figured I'd try to build something better.

So, I built **Dailyle**, a sleek and fast dashboard for daily game lovers. It's built with vanilla JS and Tailwind CSS, with no backend or logins required.

**Key Features:**

* **Curated List:** Over 70 of the most popular daily games, sorted into intuitive categories.
* **Fully Customizable ""My Games"" Tab:** Star any game to add it to your personal daily list.
* **Add Your Own:** Can't find your niche favorite? Just add any custom name and link.
* **Multiple Collections:** Create, rename, and manage different collections for different moods (e.g., ""Morning Coffee Puzzles,"" ""Lunch Break Games"").
* **Share & Import:** Share your unique collections with friends via a simple text code.
* **100% Local & Private:** Everything is saved directly in your browser's local storage. No accounts, no tracking.
* **Clean UI:** Includes a system-aware dark mode.

I'd love to get your feedback on the project! What do you think? Any features I should add or games I've missed?

1nbnhq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1nbnhq3/delve_into_grab_green_dishwasher_detergent_powder/,Delve Into Grab Green Dishwasher Detergent Powder Worth It or Not,"Testing out the Grab Green 854822003196 was quite an enlightening experience in the world of eco-friendly cleaning. As someone who’s used a fair share of dishwashing products claiming to be “gentle” or “natural,” I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect with this one. From the moment I scooped out the powder for the first load of dishes, I knew there was something unique about it. Promising powerful grease removal and a brilliant shine minus the harmful chemicals, it certainly brought intriguing claims to the table. But does it really live up to the hype? After several weeks of putting this dishwasher detergent powder through its paces, here are my thoughts.

**Design and Usability**

The packaging is nothing short of brilliant. The velcro closure bag is a small yet impactful detail that makes an everyday chore significantly less frustrating. I don’t know about you, but fumbling with finicky zip closures after a long day isn’t my idea of fun. Plus, the included measuring scoop makes dosing super simple, sparing me from messy guesswork. The instructions are crystal clear, which is a bonus for anyone like my partner, who takes appliance-related guesswork way too personally. While it’s 3.17 pounds, the bag doesn’t take up much storage space, which is ideal for our relatively small kitchen.

[See Grab Green 854822003196 deals on Amazon now.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b00kicp4vu/)

**Performance and Effectiveness**

Once loaded into my dishwasher, this powder consistently tackled even my grimiest dishes with ease—a claim I had my doubts about initially. Sticky lasagna remnants? Gone. Greasy baking trays? Spotless. Stubborn coffee stains on mugs? Not a trace. I loved how it left no chalky residue or watermarks on glassware, which had been an ongoing battle with another well-known detergent brand. Its hypoallergenic, fragrance-free formula was a big win for me personally, as I’m highly sensitive to synthetic scents, and my eyes didn’t water every time I opened the dishwasher post-cycle.

**Highlights**

- User-friendly velcro packaging design  
- Simple yet effective measuring scoop included  
- Hypoallergenic and fragrance-free, ideal for sensitivities  
- Exceptional cleaning against grease, grime, and stains  
- Leaves dishes spot-free with no residue  

**Downsides of the Product**

Of course, it’s not all perfect. One slight inconvenience was that the powder sometimes clumped when exposed to even a small amount of moisture, which was a minor annoyance during humid days. It’s also worth noting that while it cuts through grease impressively, there might be instances where an extra pre-rinse effort is required for overly dried-on food. On top of that, for a product this effective, it could feel slightly pricier than conventional brands. However, that’s to be expected with high-quality, eco-friendly ingredients.

- Prone to clumping if not stored properly  
- Occasionally requires pre-rinsing for tougher loads  
- Slightly steeper price compared to some alternatives  

**Competing Products**

Having tried other options like Cascade Platinum pods and Seventh Generation dishwasher detergents, I noticed a few differences. While Cascade pods are undeniably effective for baked-on messes, they come packed with artificial chemicals and fragrances that aren’t gentle on my allergies—or the environment. On the other hand, Seventh Generation offers decent eco-friendly performance but often leaves behind a faint film on glassware, which doesn’t happen with this detergent powder. In my experience, Grab Green stands out by striking the perfect balance between effective grease-cutting power and a residue-free, fragrance-free finish—without sacrificing its eco-conscious promise.

**Value for Money**

When it comes to cost-efficiency, the product situates itself in the “you get what you pay for” category. Sure, you might spend a little more upfront compared to traditional dishwasher detergents, but the quality justifies it. Each 3.17-pound bag is designed for 80 loads, which translates to long-lasting use. More importantly, the peace of mind that comes from using a cleaner free of phosphates, chlorine, and toxins is priceless for a household like mine. If supporting a cruelty-free, USA-made product matters in your daily choices, this one checks those boxes effortlessly.

1nbnftt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1nbnftt/should_you_try_the_best_coffee_percolator_presto/,Should You Try the Best Coffee Percolator Presto 02811 Today,"Testing the Presto 02811 coffee maker felt like stepping back into a kitchen classic while marveling at a modern twist. I’ve used many coffee machines over the years, but this stainless steel percolator truly stands out in its design, functionality, and the nostalgic charm it brings to the table. As someone who treasures the ritual of morning coffee, having a brew that balances robust flavor with ease of preparation is essential, and this elegant machine delivered on almost all fronts.

**Elegant Stainless Steel Design**

The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek, traditional stainless steel construction. It has this timeless aesthetic that blends effortlessly into any kitchen style. Unlike plastic coffee makers I’ve owned, the metal casing feels durable and promises longevity. The handle, spout, and polished exterior really make it a centerpiece rather than something you’d want to tuck away. It’s compact enough, measuring 6.25 x 9.5 x 12.9 inches, so it doesn’t hog counter space, which is a plus in my relatively small kitchen.

[Check Presto 02811 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b00df5honi/)

**Performance Highlights**

Brewing coffee with the Presto 02811 is almost therapeutic. It takes just a little over a minute per cup, meaning I can get a quick fix in no time. I tested the full 12-cup capacity for a busy weekend brunch with friends, and it brewed piping hot coffee while keeping the flavors rich and consistent. The signal light conveniently lets you know when it’s ready – such a small yet thoughtful detail. I found the automatic keep-warm feature handy, as it maintains the coffee at the perfect temperature without burning it.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**

Operating this coffee maker couldn’t have been easier. It’s a fully automatic system, so there’s no need to fuss with complex settings. The reusable filter eliminates the need for paper filters, which not only saves money but also reduces waste – an eco-friendly win. Cleaning was fairly straightforward, provided I followed the care instructions. Warm soapy water was enough for daily maintenance, and I avoided steel wool, as recommended, to keep the gloss intact. I did have to invest a bit of extra effort in scrubbing the perk spout with a pipe cleaner to get rid of stubborn coffee stains.

**Strengths**

The Presto 02811 certainly has its merits:

- Durable stainless steel body that’s both attractive and long-lasting.
- Percolates up to 12 cups at a quick, consistent pace.
- Reusable filter that reduces waste and additional expense.
- Keeps coffee hot after brewing without compromising on taste.
- Compact yet elegant design that’s ideal for table service.

**Areas for Improvement**

While I mostly enjoyed using this coffee maker, a few flaws stood out:

- It isn’t immersible, which limits cleaning to manual scrubbing.
- The spout tends to drip slightly after pouring.
- The detachable power cord can be a bit finicky during storage.
- Some might find the coffee too hot right after brewing.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other percolators like the Farberware 12-Cup Percolator, the Presto fares incredibly well in terms of design and durability. The Farberware model is slightly lighter and offers similar features but lacks the full stainless steel build of the Presto. Alternatively, modern drip machines like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 come with advanced features like programmable brewing but miss out on the bold flavors produced by percolation. If you value flavor over bells-and-whistles technology, the Presto 02811 definitely takes the crown.

**Cost-Efficiency**

When considering value for money, this coffee maker offers a highly satisfying experience. While it doesn’t pack in tech-heavy features like digital timers or Bluetooth controls (yes, some machines have that), the focus on simplicity and timeless functionality makes it worth every penny. The reusable filter and stainless steel build mean you’re making a long-term investment rather than settling for something disposable.

1nbnfd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1nbnfd1/what_worked_for_me/,What worked for me,"So a few weeks ago I did a post on this sub complaining about a 3 weeks constipation, it lasted 4 weeks overall. It felt like FOREVER and advice from some redditors was incredibly helpful for me. So here’s what worked : 

Diet/medication :

- More water
- I stopped eating fibers so much because it made the situation worse
- I stopped taking intense laxatives
- Polyethylene glycol 3350 powder once a day during 3 days
- I trusted my appetite and body signals
- I started taking phloroglucinol 3 times a day before each meal to ease my stomach burns, it helped me eat at peace.
- I had more liquid foods for my first and last meal of the day (natural orange juice along with breakfast and homemade soup in the night sometimes)
- Magnesium Citrate just after waking up, and just before sleeping. 
- I stopped drinking coffee in the morning even tho I was a morning coffee person, to avoid the cortisol that comes along with it. 
- I prioritised fresh foods and home made stuff.
- I made sure to always eat slowly.
- I ate more fruits for hydratation. 

Then, I made some changes in my lifestyle : 

- Bought some fresh gym clothes and hit the gym again, not necessarily intense workouts. It made me feel lighter and I started to feel hunger again. I was so constipated I couldn’t feel hunger anymore. Moving helps.
- I started to only sleep on my left side, it supports digestion during the night.
- I stopped food intake at least 4h before sleeping. And had a little walk/workout after my last meal to support digestion.
- I did my best to ease my stress and anxiety. Do whatever relaxes you. Take a walk, have a nap, listen to quite music, watch your comfort show, whatever it is, relax.

I think what really made the process faster was the Polyethylene glycol 3350 powder (HydraLax), I started taking it after about 25-27 days of constipation. I had to wait 3 days and boom, first bowel movement in 4 weeks. It wasn’t only Hydralax I think, but all the lifestyle and diet changes I mentioned above that helped. 

To this day, I still take the magnesium citrate twice a day, I make sure to move my body after every food intake (especially the last meal of the day), and my bowel movement is mainly activated by workout out or moving in general after meals. So I’m not completely cured I’d say, even tho I’m now able to have a bowel mvmt everyday, sometimes twice a day lol, because I still need to stay careful with water intake, quality of food, taking magnesium etc… 

Hope this helps ! ",2,1757337277.0,Constipation,1,1.0,False
1nbndxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1nbndxn/i_think_i_just_broke_my_relationship_with_my/,"I think I just broke my relationship with my mother, HELP PLEASE","I never thought I'd be writing in to this sub after years of reading, but here I am. Throwaway account because I can't have this on main.

So late last week, my mother and I were in the kitchen, talking about healthcare, when she said something about her acquaintance dying of pneumonia. So I said I'd never wish pneumonia on someone else after having had it. So she goes ""you didn't have pneumonia, you had COVID."" So I told her that yes I had COVID in 2022, but last year what I had was pneumonia.

Then I asked her why she tends to downplay my crises knowing that last year I had pneumonia but she kept saying it wasn't that serious so it might have been bronchitis, even though the only reason it didn't progress was because I medicated it early. She accused me of always assuming the worst of people and being harsh, and assuming she always operates on bad faith.

I told her in my experiences with her, this assumption is not unfounded, I have years of evidence. I have great memory, and fortunately/unfortunately, I don't forget stuff. She then told me my worldview makes it hard for her to relate with me and perhaps I should ask my friends if any of them care about me enough to be honest with me and they'd tell me the same. So I told her my friends were honest with me, and I don't react like this to them because they don't have a history of acting in bad faith towards me, unlike her.

She then said I'm trying to blackmail her, so I asked her what I get from blackmailing her, because I don't get any money, power or status. She said satisfaction, so I asked her how this could possibly be satisfying. She then said I don't have evidence of her acting in bad faith, so I started rattling evidence off.

I told her about an incident in 2017 where she sided with one of our (former) staff to accuse me of drinking in my car and throwing up on the front passenger seat, when it was juice that had poured there and was smelling. She didn't believe me, in fact she almost slapped me and sided with the worker. She then took away my car keys and drove my car for the day, only to call in the afternoon to say she realised it was in fact juice. I was infuriated, and so so hurt. I've never been so hurt. She has never apologised. Mind you, this staff member claimed she found needles in my trash to my sister insinuating I was on heroin (a lie), but my mother says she was unaware. It's true, and that's why I hate that former staff member.

So I asked her how she can do and say such things (it's a long list) yet she expects me to be her caregiver in old age, and I said in fact I do my best to be polite and still speak to you regardless. I said I'd have to be foolish as a person to believe she wishes me well. She then said I never have to speak to her again, told me she has released me of any obligation to her ever, and started crying very big tears. She seemed to be in very real pain, and she said ""I can't believe you can say such a thing given how much I bend over backwards to support you and your sister."" To be fair, it's true, she has always provided for us as a single parent. that's not in question, and I appreciate it greatly, I just don't think we can gloss over the things she's said/never apologised for. She threw her hands up and said ""Sorry for everything, I never want to hear about all this again!""

As she was walking up the stairs and I was walking after her, I said something cruel. I said, remember how when I was 15-17 and you always said you'd leave your wealth to charity and not my sister and I? Well, you better leave it to X (former staff member) and hope she steps in to cover for me and take care of you, and not me. She retorted that she can leave her money to whomever she wants, and I said good, that's what I'm suggesting. she started bawling.

I apologised for my statement and said I would still take care of her because it's my duty, but she refused. She then said I would pay for it, God would make sure of it. So I asked if she was cursing me, because parental curses are a big deal in our culture. She said no. I told her that sounded like a curse, she said it wasn't. She then said she forgave me after crying again. I did not ask for her forgiveness so I don't know why she did it. In all this, I was not crying, my expression was deadpan because she doesn't move me emotionally, she hasn't for years.

So then I started listing all my evidence, going as far back as 1997 (I was 7), when she told me that my sister would be lighter skinned than me as if it was such a bad thing not to have light skin. In 2001, when I had my period, she said it was because I was fat and ate too much, and sneered at me like I was dirty while giving me a pad. Between age 6-12, she'd always tell me to be careful what I ate if I didn't want to be fat like my estranged father's sisters.

In 2002, when I had my primary school finals, I decided to nap cause I was tired. She told me I'd fail my geography paper, and she'd not be surprised if I failed my exams overall. I was top in my school. In 2010, I came home at 10pm and she called me a prostitute and even slapped me for talking back and telling her I must be the most unsuccessful prostitute of all time, what kind of prostitute goes home that early?

She told me to stop when I got there, apparently her head was ""full."" She then said to write her a list of all her transgressions so that she can have/keep it. I said no need, I remember it all, fortunately/unfortunately. I told her I hope she was happy with the evidence. She was completely quiet, which is rare for her. She normally would argue back or interrupt, she did none of that. That was when I knew I might have gone too far, but I've wanted to say exactly what I said for a while now, though now I'm wondering if it was worth it.

For context, I'm not a very emotional person, and I'm not a crier. So as she was bawling, I was awkwardly standing there, I patter her back a few times and said ""there there."" I think she's hardened me so much to the extent that I have become a cold, hard person, especially towards her. You know how other neurodivergent people have RSD? I don't. I don't flinch when people exclude me, in fact I have some kind of schadenfreude (it happens very rarely now because I'm an adult who selects for suitable spaces).

Perhaps she's just emotionally immature, but I'm open to corrections from you all. She normally would try to speak to me and skirt past apologising, but she hasn't so far. She only called up to the attic (where I sit) yesterday to tell me the cleaner would be coming in a day in case I needed my things cleaned. When I went downstairs for my coffee today, she and my sister were in the kitchen. I greeted them, and only my sister responded. Quite immature, but that's okay. FWIW, I'm not waiting on an apology.

Now, I know I need to move. I'm here because I'm getting my business off the ground but I'll be out by 2026. My question is whether this is a permanent break so that I can mentally prepare for it. Have I broken our relationship, if so, how do I proceed?

1nbndt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1nbndt4/switched_generics_crippling_anxiety/,Switched generics - crippling anxiety!,"Hi all. I know this has been covered a bunch on here, but I figured I would share anyway. 

I take the Rhodes generic, 20xr at 6am and 10x at 11am. Works like a charm, but took a bunch of trial and error to get here.  I was diagnosed in April at age 49. It's taken a few months to dial in the medication but I finally got there..... THEN my pharmacy (Walgreens) ran out. I switched to Costco, didn't think to check the generic brand, took the meds the next day..... and crippling anxiety all day long! I then remembered reading about different generics affecting people in different ways. I looked at the bottles, and the 20s are Activus and the 10s are Elite. The Activus just gave me anxiety all day and the 10s seem to do nothing at all. I have tried these for 3 days now, and the same outcome. I didn't change anything in my schedule. Took them at the same times as usual, got exercise, stopped caffeine intake at 7am (I make a small iced coffee in the morning), ate the same, got the same sleep, etc. 

So yesterday (the 4th day), I went back to 20ir that I had left over from a prior script. At the time, I was talking half as a booster in the PM, but I found that it was too much. Anyway, I tried it again, but this time broke it into 5s and took them spaced out over the day. It actually worked really well, with no anxiety. I have about half of that script left. I see my doctor tomorrow. My question to you all is, can an IR script be filled right after 2xr scripts were filled? I just don't think I can do these generic XRs, but I just got them filled! I know I can't swap out the XRs for different XRs. I'm also worried that my doctor won't believe me or think I'm drug seeking. Hell, I will give them the freaking XRs. I don't want them. 

If anyone feels like sharing similar experiences, I would appreciate it. Have a great Monday!

There's a comic where Spider-Man's villains come to fight him and notice that he's not uttering a single word as he fights, unlike how he usually makes funny and witty one-liners when facing them. They get so unnerved by this that they turn themselves to the police, since they feel Spider-Man is silent because he's bloodlusted and is intent on finishing them off permanently.

Right out of the box, the sleek, modern design stood out. It has this minimalist aesthetic, typical of German engineering and Italian design flair, that effortlessly fit into my kitchen. I’m not usually someone who gets excited over kitchen appliances, but the black stainless steel finish is undeniably pleasing. It’s like the kind of kettle you’d expect in one of those high-end home magazines. 

**Performance and Functionality**

The first thing I noticed was how quickly this kettle boils water. With its 1500-watt power output, I’ve gone from cold water to steaming hot in just a few minutes. This is genuinely a game-changer during busy mornings when I need tea or instant coffee fast. The double-walled body is another feature that’s seriously impressed me. It’s not just about keeping the water warm but also the fact that the outer surface remains cool to the touch. I tested it while multitasking breakfast, and there was no risk of accidental burns even while carelessly reaching out for it. 

[Check ZWILLING 53101-201 price on Amazon.](https://sohdu.com/p/b08ncd98hg/)

**Highlights**

- Double-walled body keeps water hot for longer durations while staying cool to the touch.
- The 70° lid opening prevents steam from blasting into your face when pouring.
- Easy cleaning thanks to the seamless stainless-steel interior, which leaves no chance for grime buildup.
- Stylish black finish and compact design that complement any modern kitchen.
- Integrated cord winder ensures the countertop stays neat and organized.

**Areas for Improvement**

While I loved its overall build and features, there are aspects where I found room for improvement:

- The lid doesn't open fully to 90°, which makes it slightly tricky to fill water directly under a faucet.
- Skeptical about durability since it’s lightweight at just 2.87 pounds, though it hasn’t shown any issues yet.
- A slight plastic smell during the initial usages. Thankfully, this dissipated after a couple of boils.
- Price slightly leans towards the premium end for an electric kettle, even considering the brand quality.

**Ease of Cleaning**

As someone who hates scrubbing appliances, the seamless interior was a nice surprise. No little crevices where residue can accumulate. A quick rinse, and there’s no lingering smell of tea or coffee. This impressed me, especially because my previous kettles always had those mineral buildups that were a nightmare to clean. Being a hand-washable product may discourage some dishwasher enthusiasts, but honestly, it’s so easy to clean, you won’t mind the manual effort.

**Target Audience**

If you’re into efficient, durable, and thoughtfully designed appliances, this kettle is undeniably worth exploring. I’d recommend it for those who appreciate more than just functionality from their kitchen items. It’s perfect for coffee or tea enthusiasts who need their water at the ideal temperature quickly and without too much hassle. Stylish enough for a modern urban apartment and functional enough for everyday family use.

**Competing Brands**

When comparing to some of the competitors, like the Breville Luxe Kettle or the Cuisinart Cordless PerfecTemp, the ZWILLING model finds itself in an upper-tier category. Breville has a higher capacity and more temperature settings, but the ZWILLING kettle wins when it comes to its cool-touch exterior and sleeker compact design. Against the Cuisinart option, which flaunts variable temperature settings, the ZWILLING kettle feels a bit limited, but the overall craftsmanship and easy maintenance give it an edge. Where the ZWILLING kettle could improve is by offering similar temperature control settings—especially for tea drinkers who prefer specific presets.

**Price Performance**

Talking about its value, the kettle doesn’t come cheap. But it’s built to combine aesthetics, safety, and utility, which probably justifies its price tag. For someone who values a mix of style and functionality, it does feel like a worthwhile investment. Compared to budget-friendly electric kettles, the ZWILLING kettle undoubtedly presents itself as a premium alternative. Whether that’s a fair trade-off depends on how much you care about improved safety features, user-friendly design, and long-term durability.

When I got pregnant, I had a tough time and wasn’t as sexual as I was before. When I was 3 months pregnant, I saw some flirty messages and he said that it was just a girl he met at a coffee shop and it was nothing. That he would tell her he was in the wrong for engaging with her etc. When my daughter was 1 years old, I discovered that he had continued with that woman and had fallen in love with her. They never stopped communicating and even had a sexual relationship. I was shocked, heartbroken, hormonal and confused. He was so incredibly sorry, crying. Telling me that he didn’t want to lose me or our daughter and that he didn’t really love her but that he got carried away with lust. He also told me that he fell out of love with me at some
Point but that he wanted us to fall in love again. I saw convos where they were telling each other how much they love each other and how he wanted to introduce our daughter to her. I also saw naked pictures of the woman, she is beautiful - but all plastic. Fake boobs, fake butt, nose job, fake lips etc. everything I am NOT. To make a long story short, we decided to work on things to not break up our family. For 6 months, we did couples therapy, he stopped drinking, smoking, no porn etc. he seemed like a new man. Well fast forward once again to a year later (my daughter is now 2) and I checked his phone after a work trip. And I saw that he was making late night phone calls to that girl AGAIN!!! And also has pictures from her instagram saved on his phone (new pics she had posted).. I’m so heartbroken, but clearly he is in love with her and can’t let her go. 
My thing is - should I leave and break up our little family? I have a job but don’t make nearly enough money to be on my own or even just move out. Or should I just stay as is and tell him we can have an open marriage or live as roommates? He is such a good guy without the dark side. He’s a great father, s great friend. He just happens to be in love with someone else. I will never trust him again. I am so mad. Mad at him and mad at me. Please help. I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this.

My (28F) brother Jake (31M) is getting married next month to his fiancée Sarah (29F). Here's the issue: Sarah used to be married to our cousin Mike (32M), and they had a really messy divorce two years ago that split our entire extended family.

During the divorce, Sarah accused Mike of some pretty serious things that were never proven, and she ended up with most of their assets. Mike's side of the family (including my aunt and uncle who helped raise us) completely cut her off and said she was manipulative.
Six months after the divorce was final, Jake and Sarah started dating. Jake claims they ""reconnected"" at a coffee shop, but the timing feels suspicious to everyone. Mike found out through social media and it destroyed him. He had a breakdown and had to take leave from work.

Now Jake's getting married and wants me to be a bridesmaid. My parents are going because ""family comes first"" but half our relatives are boycotting. Mike and his parents aren't invited, obviously, which means I have to choose between my brother's wedding and the uncle who basically raised me when dad was deployed overseas.
Jake says I'm being dramatic and that Mike's mental health isn't his responsibility. Sarah keeps texting me about dress fittings like nothing happened. Meanwhile, my cousin Mike is barely holding it together and seeing a therapist twice a week.

I told Jake I can't support a marriage that destroyed our family, and now my parents are furious, saying I'm ""choosing sides over love."" But I can't shake the feeling that this whole situation is wrong.

They’ll let you taste and customize the level of sourness but by default, their tamarind-based broth was mild, beefy and a bit salty. It had chunks of tender corned beef hence the pink color, it’s flavorful on its own, more savory than tangy, but overall goes well with this dish. The veggies were cooked ok, so yeah, I get the hype! We loved their Fried Kesong Puti, P530 which had a nice crunch and chew, served with their sweet chili guava and garlic sauce. Also tried their Beef Caldereta, P780 which also had tender beef and lots of spices but not necessarily spicy, not intensely tomatoey nor bland, just somewhere in the middle. I can eat their Sentro Bagoong Rice, P550 on its own as it has lots of toppings, and hits all the right notes. Rated GG, P416 was crunchy but a bit too salty.

On my second week, my manager (male, 40s) handed me his empty coffee mug and said, “Since you’re the new girl, you can grab my coffee for me, black with one sugar.”

Nowhere in my job description did it say “coffee fetcher.” But instead of arguing, I smiled, took the mug, and went straight to the break room.

I filled it with piping hot water, added exactly one sugar packet, and placed it back on his desk with the brightest smile I could manage.

He took one sip, immediately gagged, and spat it into the trash. “What the hell is this?”

I said, “Black with one sugar, just like you asked.”

How do I navigate this after asking once didn't have results?,"Hi everyone, I am F36, en have been seeing a M43 since a few months.  
We live long(ish) distance, about a 4 hour drive in different countries (EU), and can only meet up every 2 months or so, but are in regular contact over whatsapp and IG.  
We are both non native English speakers, but speak English together because we don't speak each others language. My English is better than his, but we can have full conversations without too many issues. (give or take a few words)

We decided to take things slow because of this reason also.  
We mutually agreed that it was important to focus on getting to know each other in this stage.

He is very sweet, excited about texting me, and we have making music as a mutual hobby, which we share about regularly and hype each other up.  
This has been super nice, but I do not have a lot of dating experience due to an abusive ex when I was beginning 20's that made me avoid dating for a really long time, so I have no real experience on how to deal with issues when it comes to dating. 

Despite that we can talk for hours, and that we call twice a week, I recently have noticed that he does not really ask me any questions to get to know me.  
I do so with him and I have fallen into a habit of telling about my things after I asked him about his, but he never asks me anything about myself out of his own curiosity.

My love language is communication and feeling seen.  
One of the things that makes me feel loved the most is when someone is genuinely curious about me.  
You know, when I tell something and someone makes it into a conversation. I enjoy doing that with other people also. I do that with him too, when he tells me something about himself or his life, I ask questions and want to hear more about it  
So this hurts me a little that I do not get that back.

I mentioned to him, because it makes me feel like he does not care to get to know me at all, and he was very kind about it. He told me that he did not want me to feel that way and that he wants to know everything about me. He said he will try to ask me more questions.

This has not exactly happened yet.  
What he does though, is ask me 12 times a day how my day is going and what I am up to.  
In the beginning that seemed sweet, like at least he was trying, but that fell flat once I realized he does not react to the things I tell him.

Yesterday he asked me how my day was going. I told him I had a nice day: I went to the park for a coffee, had a phone call with my best friend as she is going through a divorce, and I planned to work on some music later.  
His only reaction was to tell me about what he was doing. No acknowledgement of anything I told him.

Now, I understand that this happens sometimes, and that not everything I say is worthy of a response. (lol)  
But this is how it goes every time. He asks about my day, I tell him something, and he doesn't react to it.  
It feels as loving as the mandatory ""how are you"" people ask when seeing you, where you are just supposed to say you are fine and not actually tell them how you are. It feels scripted in a way..

Important thing to mention is that he has adhd, and so am I. He grew up in a family where half of them have autism, so he is might not be used to actually expected to be asking things / talking.  
I know and understand that some of this could be contributed to this,, but I am tired of always being the one to ask him about him, and have a conversation with him about how he is doing while he does not do that back.

Besides this issue he is kind, and friendly, and we have fun together, but I struggle to feel important and to feel seen/understood. It makes me feel like he just like the attention he is getting from me, and it makes me doubt if I want to build a relationship with this man.

Any helpful advice, personal experiences, or anything that can help me navigate this is very welcome.

Edit: Before anyone trips over the distance: I know it is a bit of a hurdle too, but I never felt like something is off with him. I also have met his family and sisters, so I don't think there is anything going on in the line of him living a double life or anything.  
We also spoke about our future together, and agreed that we take it slow but are both definitely in the same boat about what this relationship is now and where we want it to grow.  
He also seems open to talk about stuff, but I struggle with understanding if he fully gets what I mean.  
The language barrier might also contribute to that.",2,1757336197.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1nbmzm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nbmzm3/i_think_i_just_broke_my_relationship_with_my/,"I think I just broke my relationship with my mother, HELP PLEASE","I never thought I'd be writing in to this sub after years of reading, but here I am. Throwaway account because I can't have this on main.

So late last week, my mother and I were in the kitchen, talking about healthcare, when she said something about her acquaintance dying of pneumonia. So I said I'd never wish pneumonia on someone else after having had it. So she goes ""you didn't have pneumonia, you had COVID."" So I told her that yes I had COVID in 2022, but last year what I had was pneumonia. 

Then I asked her why she tends to downplay my crises knowing that last year I had pneumonia but she kept saying it wasn't that serious so it might have been bronchitis, even though the only reason it didn't progress was because I medicated it early. She accused me of always assuming the worst of people and being harsh, and assuming she always operates on bad faith. 

I told her in my experiences with her, this assumption is not unfounded, I have years of evidence. I have great memory, and fortunately/unfortunately, I don't forget stuff. She then told me my worldview makes it hard for her to relate with me and perhaps I should ask my friends if any of them care about me enough to be honest with me and they'd tell me the same. So I told her my friends were honest with me, and I don't react like this to them because they don't have a history of acting in bad faith towards me, unlike her.

She then said I'm trying to blackmail her, so I asked her what I get from blackmailing her, because I don't get any money, power or status. She said satisfaction, so I asked her how this could possibly be satisfying. She then said I don't have evidence of her acting in bad faith, so I started rattling evidence off. 

I told her about an incident in 2017 where she sided with one of our (former) staff to accuse me of drinking in my car and throwing up on the front passenger seat, when it was juice that had poured there and was smelling. She didn't believe me, in fact she almost slapped me and sided with the worker. She then took away my car keys and drove my car for the day, only to call in the afternoon to say she realised it was in fact juice. I was infuriated, and so so hurt. I've never been so hurt. She has never apologised. Mind you, this staff member claimed she found needles in my trash to my sister insinuating I was on heroin (a lie), but my mother says she was unaware. It's true, and that's why I hate that former staff member.

So I asked her how she can do and say such things (it's a long list) yet she expects me to be her caregiver in old age, and I said in fact I do my best to be polite and still speak to you regardless. I said I'd have to be foolish as a person to believe she wishes me well. She then said I never have to speak to her again, told me she has released me of any obligation to her ever, and started crying very big tears. She seemed to be in very real pain, and she said ""I can't believe you can say such a thing given how much I bend over backwards to support you and your sister."" To be fair, it's true, she has always provided for us as a single parent. that's not in question, and I appreciate it greatly, I just don't think we can gloss over the things she's said/never apologised for. She threw her hands up and said ""Sorry for everything, I never want to hear about all this again!""

As she was walking up the stairs and I was walking after her, I said something cruel. I said, remember how when I was 15-17 and you always said you'd leave your wealth to charity and not my sister and I? Well, you better leave it to X (former staff member) and hope she steps in to cover for me and take care of you, and not me. She retorted that she can leave her money to whomever she wants, and I said good, that's what I'm suggesting. she started bawling.

I apologised for my statement and said I would still take care of her because it's my duty, but she refused. She then said I would pay for it, God would make sure of it. So I asked if she was cursing me, because parental curses are a big deal in our culture. She said no. I told her that sounded like a curse, she said it wasn't. She then said she forgave me after crying again. I did not ask for her forgiveness so I don't know why she did it. In all this, I was not crying, my expression was deadpan because she doesn't move me emotionally, she hasn't for years.

So then I started listing all my evidence, going as far back as 1997 (I was 7), when she told me that my sister would be lighter skinned than me as if it was such a bad thing not to have light skin. In 2001, when I had my period, she said it was because I was fat and ate too much, and sneered at me like I was dirty while giving me a pad. Between age 6-12, she'd always tell me to be careful what I ate if I didn't want to be fat like my estranged father's sisters.

In 2002, when I had my primary school finals, I decided to nap cause I was tired. She told me I'd fail my geography paper, and she'd not be surprised if I failed my exams overall. I was top in my school. In 2010, I came home at 10pm and she called me a prostitute and even slapped me for talking back and telling her I must be the most unsuccessful prostitute of all time, what kind of prostitute goes home that early?

She told me to stop when I got there, apparently her head was ""full."" She then said to write her a list of all her transgressions so that she can have/keep it. I said no need, I remember it all, fortunately/unfortunately. I told her I hope she was happy with the evidence. She was completely quiet, which is rare for her. She normally would argue back or interrupt, she did none of that. That was when I knew I might have gone too far, but I've wanted to say exactly what I said for a while now, though now I'm wondering if it was worth it.

For context, I'm not a very emotional person, and I'm not a crier. So as she was bawling, I was awkwardly standing there, I patter her back a few times and said ""there there."" I think she's hardened me so much to the extent that I have become a cold, hard person, especially towards her. You know how other neurodivergent people have RSD? I don't. I don't flinch when people exclude me, in fact I have some kind of schadenfreude (it happens very rarely now because I'm an adult who selects for suitable spaces).

Now, I don't think my mother is an actual narcissist, perhaps she's just emotionally immature, but I'm open to corrections from you all, I really learn a lot from this sub. She normally would try to speak to me, but she hasn't so far. She only called up to the attic (where I sit) yesterday to tell me the cleaner would be coming in a day in case I needed my things cleaned. When I went downstairs for my coffee today, she and my sister were in the kitchen. I greeted them, and only my sister responded. Quite immature, but that's okay. FWIW, I'm not waiting on an apology.

Now, I know I need to move. I'm here because I'm getting my business off the ground but I'll be out by 2026. My question is whether this is a permanent break so that I can mentally prepare for it. Have I broken our relationship, if so, how do I proceed?",3,1757336151.0,raisedbynarcissists,6,1.0,False

this is what it’s like

it’s a phone call
that rips through your chest
leaves you gasping in the grass
while your wife’s mother pulls into the driveway
because neither of you can drive
not like this

it’s the longest hour of your life
in the passenger seat, silent
watching the world blur by
feeling every second
like glass in your lungs

halfway there
your hand reaches back
you hand her your gun
tell her “hide it”
because you know yourself
and you don’t trust yourself
and that’s just the truth

it’s pulling open the door before the car stops
running across a field you grew up in
toward people you know, lined up, waiting
like you’re supposed to know what to do

it’s seeing the ambulance
seeing the looks in their eyes
knowing before you even get close
you’ve lost your only son

it’s the first decision
within twenty minutes of arrival
fire or dirt?

it’s the first night alone
in your childhood bedroom
knowing that’s where he spent his last 
It’s yelling at stars
walking circles in the field
looking for answers that aren’t there

it’s the funeral
where everyone comes to say they’re sorry
you stand and shake hands
hug strangers
feel nothing but the weight in your chest
and the heat behind your eyes
you just keep swallowing life

it’s going home
to a house that doesn’t fit anymore
trying to make coffee, trying to eat
trying to look your daughter in the eye
when she asks questions you can’t answer

it’s going back to work
pretending to care about schedules and calls
while your mind drifts
to the dirt under your knees
when you fell in that field

it’s buying a new house
ripping out carpet, painting walls
tearing your hands on nails
forgetting to eat
because working until you can’t think
is easier than thinking

it’s starting a company
fighting depression with a paintbrush
trying to find purpose again
in straight lines on a wall
in the steady hum of a sander

it’s watching your heart shut off 
the moment he died
and clawing to bring it back online
not for the world
not for strangers
but for your wife, who stayed
and your daughter, who still needs you

it’s being the man beside the casket
and then being the man beside the sink
beside the bed
beside the school drop-off
beside your wife on the days she breaks too

it’s not heroic
it’s not strong
it’s not anything people say it is

it’s just what you do

because the world didn’t stop
even when yours did

because love didn’t die with him
and neither did you

and that’s the hard, cold, ugly truth

this is what it’s like.

I remember she told me that when she was in high school that her and her sisters had used a ouija board to connect with the other side - one sister is dead and the other has serious mental illness issues.

What she didn’t tell me is that they still had the ouija board and it was hidden in the closet of the bedroom I had. I found it during spring cleaning - the box fell out of the closet, and I picked it up long enough to put it back.

From then on, I would hear things when home alone, getting the feeling that someone or something was watching me. One night I awoke to the smell of stale cigar smoke and the sound of heavy boots stamping across the floor in my small bedroom. I opened my eyes to see a man in an old-timey suit with a tall hat and a cigar sticking out of his mouth; I could feel the heat off the cherry of the cigar. He stared at me for a minute or two and then walked through the bedroom door.

We ended up moving the following spring. The duplex we rented seemed innocent enough at the time. And then the uneasiness set in when Dad’s girlfriend started coming over and leaving her things there. Then the “things” started happening.

I began to have night terrors, I would feel a large snake or small leviathan crawling in my bed and curling up to put its head on my chest. I started having vivid dreams about a friend that died of a heroin overdose and could smell the dank smell of his menthol cigarettes.

It got so bad that I developed insomnia and could only really sleep on the couch in our living room. And then I encountered the Shaman.

I found bits of old arrowheads in our backyard but didn’t tell anyone. I was laying on the couch opposite a big picture window one night. I felt something grab my wrists and pull me hard into our coffee table. It was so hard and fast that I woke up ready to fight. And then I saw the Shaman…. He stood in my living room , lit only by the moonlight coming through that window. He stood there staring me down - he remained no matter how many times I blinked or rubbed my eyes. And just like that he was gone. From then I never felt safe in that house - disembodied voices, lights flickering, shadows, figures passing in peripheral vision. 

Those two periods brought the understanding that I’m not alone… and there are things that go bump in the night.

1nbmowm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nbmowm/lost_and_kinda_hopeless/,Lost and kinda hopeless,"Hello. Yes I’m reaching out for help on Reddit. I’ll
preface this with I’ve never been the type of person who gets depressed. That seems to have changed. For 20 years I was in a relationship with my best friend. We did everything together, we were always together. We grew up together. We shared experiences together. We built a life together. For ten of those years we were married. Almost two years ago she cheated on me and lied about it. After some discussions and time, we agreed to do couples therapy. But that never happened. She didn’t wanna do therapy anymore. Then she told me she cheated on me again. Again she lied about what she was really doing when she was actually cheating on me. We’ve been divorced for almost a year now. She’s already moved on to a new relationship and seems to be doing way better without me. This person that I’ve seen almost everyday and talked to everyday, I have no relationship with anymore. It feels like a death. 

So I did what I thought was the next step for me, I got back on dating apps. I got back on sooner than I should have but I met someone and we really hit it off. We connected instantly. I thought I hit the jackpot and found someone again. I told her I liked her a few months after but she didn’t feel the same way. We still hung out as friends but then she got into a situationship with another guy and our relationship got weird. She sends me a text one day and says she doesn’t want to see me for a while. Now we don’t talk but I still think about her all the time. Like literally all the time. I want to text her everyday and see how she is doing or what she’s been up to but I just can’t because I know she doesn’t want anything from me or to see me. I feel as though my time with her is done and that’s really hard to process. 

I’ve tried therapy a few times. First time I couldn’t afford the continued sessions and the second time I didn’t really click with my therapist. I’m still looking for the right one currently but haven’t had any luck. 

The reason I’m writing this is because today I went on a date with a girl I meet through a dating app. She asked me out and we met up at a coffee shop. I tried so hard to be in the moment but I couldn’t. Our conversation just wasn’t working. I was disassociated and I could tell she could see that. She even pointed out how nervous she could tell I was. I walked away from that meeting with such an empty feeling. When I got home I couldn’t function. My mind went to places I haven’t been before. “You’re not good enough” “you’re boring” “no one wants to be with you” ”just give up” “why are you still trying?” Although I haven’t been diagnosed as depressed, I feel like I’m in the stages or already there. I am always sad. Some days it’s so unbearable. There are only two things keeping me moving forward right now. One is I have a trip with my parents coming up soon. The other is I’m moving to be closer to my family in a different state early next year. 

I know the internet isn’t the best place to be sharing these feelings and thoughts but I don’t know. Maybe someone out there needs to see this. Maybe I’m looking for advice. Maybe I’m typing this right now as some sort of process to help me deal with everything. ",1,1757335362.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1nbmo11,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1nbmo11/kendu_why_community_based_coins_are_better_than/,Kendu - Why Community Based Coins Are Better Than KOL Based,"KOL based coins are pretty rampant in the market rn and tbf to them some are actually doing quite well in terms of market cap. However, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this won't last. They typically hold incredibly large supplies, engagement and community efforts have a single point of failure and tbh they have a ceiling, there is only so much work one person can do.

IMO decentralisation is always the way, after all look at Doge. Doge follows a decentralised type of development and look at the success that is having. 2021 Shib was also heavily dependant on community efforts as well as Pepe... History favours community led projects over KOL reliant ones so why would this cycle be any different, after all 10,000 heads are better than 1

**Kendu** is a completely decentralised, community led project with IRL projects announced very frequently all by random community members, these are not led by a ""team"". Some examples include energy drinks, coffee, merch, Pickleball tournaments, spices and many more!

Kendu is also not ignoring the social media realm and has the strongest Reddit and Stocktwits community, whilst also performing very strong on X. This alone would be enough to make Kendu a top gainer during AltSeason. Instead of relying on one person we have 1000s working round the clock pushing this project to the top.

This decentralisation is also present in our distribution, we have a HHI score of 27 which is insane, I highly recommend you compare this with other coins to show the levels to this.

We are outworking coins at much higher market caps and with more holders because we do not rely on KOLS.

**We rely on ourselves - no one is coming to save you - this is the Kendu mentality**

Join the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  
Skip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.  
All the signs were there...

I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)

1nbmnxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1nbmnxv/am_i_adding_pressure_by_supporting_boundaries/,Am I “adding pressure” by supporting boundaries,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years and moved in together about 5 months ago. He has an adorable 4 year old who I care for and treat like my own. I am childless and this is my first experience dating someone with a child.  My parents divorced when I was around 3 and I’ve also had stepparents on both my mom and dad’s side so can sympathize with his child a lot. I love this man with all of my heart and we have plans to get engaged within the next year.

My SO and his BM were never married and had a child unexpectedly after 3 months of knowing each other. Despite everything my SO did the right thing and proposed and bought a house. However they broke up when his child was around 6 months old due to multiple cases of infidelity on her end and a domestic dispute. My SO tried his best to work with her to stay together even did therapy but his efforts were met with her getting her hair done during therapy sessions or her saying she fell out of love with him when she was 6 months pregnant. 

All of this being said, when our relationship was still fresh she did make several attempts to try again but he declined for his own sanity. I did not let this bother me but did continue to move slower with him because I wasn’t sure if he would go back. 3 years later we are still together and very much in love. We spoil his daughter and have an amazing time living together as a family. I even started to form a relationship with her mother, have her my number, met up for coffee hugged and shared some laughs. She and I have never had any issues personally with one another and she’s even invited me to her daughter’s bday last year with my SO. 

My SO is amazing with his daughter and has 50/50 custody, pays for all extracurriculars and clothes supplies ect on his end and showers his child with affection, trips, and extended family love. From my observation his daughter has never liked transitioning back to her mothers house as much as being with her father and I. She cries every time she goes back to her mom and even says I don’t want to be with her or go back there. At daycare drop offs she cries when her dad (my SO) drops her off but not when her mom does. As their daughter has gotten older and started to be more vocal she has continued to say things to her mother like “I don’t like being with you” which has now caused tension between us and her mother. Her mother blames my SO for not saying no to her or having rules. He has spoken to his daughter several times saying you will have a great time at mommy’s house and supports her spending time with her mother. He has even asked her why she’s doesn’t like going back but all she says is I want to be with daddy.

Recently because of her sadness my SO’s BM has been suggesting that they spend time with one another together for the child. My SO does not want to do joint birthday parties but has agreed of course of schooling events recitals etc everything else together. She gets angry and upset everytime he sets a boundary and lashes out at him. Recently she’s become more persistent and even started sending old personal photos of just the two of them (my SO and BM) to his phone. She has also started asking the child what would it make her feel better if she and daddy and mommy did things all together, basically filling her head with ideas when the child did not explicitly ask. She has also started reaching back out to my SO’s family giving them gifts from her trips and even going directly to his sister asking her to watch their daughter without telling my SO. She texts my SO’s family for Mother’s Day and Father’s Day and even invites them to her separate birthday party for the child knowing my SO has asked to keep things separate for now. Most recently SO and I went on a trip for a friends birthday and she dropped their daughter at my SOs sisters house because the child asked to see her and she needed to run errands. She also has her own family that lives close by mother and sister who occasionally watch her. While she was at my SO’s sisters house somehow their conversation divulged that my SO and I were in a foreign country and she texted him during an argument saying have fun in “fill in country where we are.” 

I am starting to feel like she’s doing things to be spiteful or that she is feeling guilt that her child enjoys being with her father more but I’m not sure that involving herself into my SO’s personal life despite his uncomfortability with it is the way. While everything she does pisses me off and makes me feel like she’s trying to weasel her way back in with him by going through his family I still have said to my man that I support whatever decisions he want to do for his child even if that’s doing activities alone with his ex. I am also starting to not want to have a relationship with her at this point due to the disrespect of our relationship. My SO wants to set boundaries with her and has let his family know that and while some are in support some are feeling sorry for her and want to maintain a close relationship for the sake of the child. On top of all this my SO’s father has told him not to let pressure from me have him affect relationships with his BM or his sister. This is extremely hurtful when all of his decisions have been his own and all he does is support me in my feelings when his ex disrespects me. We are torn here any advice on how to keep boundaries but not let down the child would be great. ",0,1757335285.0,stepparents,4,0.5,False

1nbmkwp,https://v.redd.it/nr8mmgubrxnf1,Why Do People Assign Value to the Process?,"The journey is where identity, meaning, and mastery are forged

📦 Framing the Question
Why do people assign value to the process—even when the end result is all that others may see? From software engineering to gourmet cooking, it’s not just about what gets made, but how it’s made. The keyword here is “value the process”, and understanding that value reveals how we grow, persist, and find meaning. This post explores both the beauty and the limits of process—and how it can either elevate or obscure our purpose.

From Assembly Lines to Masterpieces

Imagine two cups of coffee. One from a vending machine—quick, convenient, impersonal. The other from a barista who grinds beans, steams milk, and perfects the pour. They may cost the same, but one carries story, skill, and intention. That’s what the process adds—depth.

We value the process because it’s where we demonstrate care, craftsmanship, and commitment. It’s why handmade items cost more, why fans follow an artist’s evolution, and why builders prefer solving a problem over simply copying code. The process shows how much of us is in the work.

Process Is the Real Resume

We praise results—but we remember process. A product might succeed or fail, but the process reveals grit, curiosity, and integrity. That’s why interviews probe for failure stories, learning loops, and decision-making patterns.

In many cases, the process outlives the product. A startup might fold, but founders who built with integrity get backed again. Process becomes your narrative—and your calling card.

When Process Doesn’t Matter

But here’s the crucial caveat: context matters. Emergency medicine doesn’t reward elegant technique over saving lives. Military operations prioritize speed over craftsmanship. In these cases, the best process is raw, adaptive execution.

Even in creative or technical fields, obsessing over process can backfire:

A writer hand-copying their drafts to “feel inspired”
A team with 5 approval layers but no output
A coder who endlessly refactors while deadlines fly by
These are moments when process becomes performance art—detached from purpose.

Real-World Example: From Kitchen to Character

Consider a chef preparing a 10-course tasting menu. Guests only see the final plate, but behind it lies weeks of sourcing, testing, and refining. Every dish is a story of failure, experimentation, and trust in the process. It’s not just food—it’s philosophy served hot.

This holds across domains:

In software: clean, tested code is more trusted than a last-minute patch
In therapy: deep change requires time and repetition
In education: conceptual understanding outweighs memorized answers
Yet even here, balance is key. A chef perfecting one sauce for six months while customers wait? That’s process turned obstacle.

Process Gives Meaning. Meaning Fuels Motivation.

So, why does process matter? Because meaning lives in effort. The process is where we stumble, reflect, adapt—and become something new. Outcomes can be lucked into. But process? That’s ours.

Still, process can become a crutch. When people fall in love with their routine, they may avoid the hard part—shipping, sharing, finishing. The writer who never submits. The artist who’s “still refining.” The manager who prioritizes meetings over action.

That’s not honoring the process. That’s hiding inside it.

The Tension: Process vs. Results

The healthiest approach recognizes this tension: Process shapes us. Results test us. Great practitioners don’t choose—they dance between both.

Value the process enough to grow.
Respect the result enough to deliver.
The process should support your impact, not replace it.

🧠 Summary & Takeaway

People don’t just value what you build—they value how you built it, but only when that “how” supports a meaningful “what.” The process reveals dedication and depth—but must remain a tool, not a shield. Strive for the sweet spot: care about your craft, stay accountable to outcomes.

🧬 QuestionStrings to Practice

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding.

🎯 Purposeful Process String
For when you’re deep in effort and unsure if it’s worth it:

“What am I learning right now?” →

“Is this shaping me for the better?” →

“Would I still do this if no one noticed?” →

“What part of this excites me?” →

“Is my process helping or hindering my goals?”

Try using this when refining a habit, building something complex, or mentoring someone stuck in “perfection mode.”

1nbmfua,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1nbmfua/half_a_decade_later_and_we_connected/,Half a decade later and we connected,"Six years ago, my ex (M33) and I (M31) broke up because he needed to get sober. It wasn’t about a lack of love, but about him needing to focus entirely on his recovery. We never had a clean breakup; it was more of a fade-out, and later I got an apology as part of his Step 9 amends. I accepted it, and I honestly thought that was the end of our story.

Out of nowhere, he recently reached out and asked to meet. It was on his sobriety anniversary. He told me he needed “closure,” that the “door was never closed,” and he wanted to shut it so he could move on. Instead of a quick coffee, we ended up on a four-mile walk that lasted over an hour. During that time, he admitted that he still feels love for me as his first real love, that he’s never felt the same with anyone else since, and that what we had was intense and meaningful. He even apologized again for ghosting me when he left. I told him that it was painful but also happy to see him, and that I never really got over him either.

Since that walk, things have only gotten more confusing. He reacted with jealousy when I mentioned I had been with someone else, literally joking “gross” and laughing. He asked me not to attend an upcoming event because he didn’t want gossip or drama in front of his conservative family and friends. They might remember me and piece together what happened in the past. I get it probably is awkward i will be around all of those people he introduced me to without him there. I reassured him multiple times that I would never disrespect him, but he kept circling back to make sure I’d stay quiet. He practically jumped when I first told him I planned to go. And mind you I told him while we were on our walk - unexpected he would act that way. Later, he backtracked, saying, “I never said don’t go. It’s your choice. Just keep it low key. Don’t make your decision about me.” But the reality is that his comfort clearly dictated everything. Then, after I sent him a thoughtful message about how I’d protect his peace, he went completely silent.

This is now two weeks in a row where my emotions have been completely shaken up by him. He says this was about closure, but nothing about his actions feels like closure. To me, closure should be clean, short, and final. Instead, I got confessions that he’s never found what we had again, jealousy and protectiveness, long texts unpacking family shame, gossip, and control, and then silence when I tried to reassure him. I keep asking myself: if he doesn’t want me back, then why do all of this? His actions and words don’t match. It feels like unfinished love, but he’s too scared or ashamed to admit it.

The hardest part is that despite all of this — the anger, the confusion, the emotional rollercoaster — if he told me he wanted to try again, I would. I’d take it slow, I’d work on it, and I’d get to know the “new” him as a sober adult. That’s how much I still love him. But right now, I feel stuck in limbo, where his words say “closure,” but his actions keep me hooked and emotionally invested. It’s exhausting and it feels deeply unfair.

TL;DR: My ex came back after six years saying he wanted “closure,” but instead admitted he never found anyone like me, acted jealous, tried to control me going to an event, and then went silent. Nothing about this feels like closure, and I still love him. Do I try to get him back, or finally close this chapter myself?",1,1757334655.0,ExNoContact,3,1.0,False

1nbmcvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1nbmcvm/immersion_brews_500ml/,Immersion brews 500ml,"So I was wondering what people do for immersion when doing 500ml. I want to add a brewer. 

BACKGROUND: I have a Moccamaster Automatic, a Barista Pro and a French Press. There’s a grinder on the Barista and I have the Moccamaster Burr Grinder. 

The coffee on the Moccamaster is great when doing big brews (1l) with generic powder. But when I try to make 500mls with expensive fresh beans I feel like the grounds aren’t saturated enough. So I tried the bloom technique where you withhold the pot and it works but it’s janky. 

I tried doing shots on the Barista Pro and adding water. That works but it feels like I’d rather add milk to my shots. 

The French Press tastes the best imo but it’s so grimey. 

CHALLENGE: So I’ve been looking to add a manual brewer. Has to make 500ml which I drink with like an hour in between. I have thermos options. And I add milk. I know. But still. 

I know there are tons of options and V60 is love etc but I honestly don’t want to add a gooseneck kettle and spend too much time pouring. I can do bloom and then dump. 

Also most posts only focus on 250 ish ml brewing. I need 500. 

I see the Clever is an option. The Hario Switch. And a Mugen switch. And a Switch/Mugen hack which I think is the same but I can’t really tell. There’s the Stagg X/XF which gets mixed reviews. Kalita and V60 seems labour intensive. 

There’s also the option of going with a better filtered French Press like the Espro but that seems to withhold some water. 

I know you can’t pick for me but I’d be interested to hear from others who brew for two cups (500ml) in the morning and add milk. 

Cheers and thanks.

Here’s the unfiltered version.,"People think modelling is all about fancy clothes, photo shoots, and strutting down runways. Truth is… it’s a lot of waiting around, rejection, and learning how to pose like your spine doesn’t hurt.

Here’s the breakdown from someone actually in it:

* You’ll hear “not the right look” more times than you hear your own name. Don’t take it personally sometimes it just means you weren’t tall enough, edgy enough, or didn’t have the right haircut that day.
* Skincare and grooming matter more than your morning coffee. If you think “washing my face with soap is enough,” forget it.
* Portfolios are everything. Selfies won’t cut it. You need pro shots that show range: editorial, commercial, runway.
* Networking is huge. Sometimes the big jobs come from random casting calls, sometimes it’s just someone remembering you from a test shoot.

But here’s the upside: you get to work with insanely creative people, wear clothes you could never afford, and occasionally see your face blown up on a billboard (which is both cool and weird).

TL;DR: Modelling is hard work in disguise. If you love fashion and can laugh at yourself while posing in clothes you’d never pick out on your own, you’ll probably survive.",1,1757334420.0,u_Remote-Departure6946,0,1.0,False

# Bleeding Across the South

**A tale of loyalty, desperation and loss.**

Origins

Donovan Larrick, sixteen, lost his father overseas before he could walk. Kit Ketrey, seventeen, lost his mother to a heroin overdose. They work the counter at a failing pawn shop in small-town Georgia, keeping the lights on with side hustles: fake jewelry, skimmed cash, and unregistered pistols.

Donovan spends his nights on Luna’s porch. She's his girlfriend, first love and the center of his world trapped in an abusive home. He is saving every dollar he can to get her out and move out of town with her.

Don and Kit are glued together like brothers. They work dead-end shifts at the pawn shop, scamming where they can, and killing long nights with cigarettes, old kung fu movies, and each other’s company.

Segment I: Easy Money.

One night in the pawn shop’s back office, Kit stumbles on a job post that feels both stupid and serious: $1,000 cash to torch a suburban home. The request is posted under a throwaway handle by a man named Clay Holloway.

Clay’s father, Walter Holloway, had been a local real estate baron—owned half the strip malls in the county. When Walter died, his will divided everything between Clay’s two older sisters and his younger brother. Clay got nothing. “Incompetent, unfit to manage finances,” it reads. Clay fought it in court. The siblings lawyered up. After six months of bitter probate hearings, Clay was slapped with legal fees he couldn’t pay and barred from appealing again. His sisters sold off Walter’s boat and vacation property, cashed in a hefty life insurance policy, and put the suburban house--the family’s original home--on the market.

Donovan leans over Kit’s shoulder, reading every line. “A grand for one night’s work. That’s more than we’ll make in a month here.”

They reach out to the poster, Clay Holloway, and strike a deal: one thousand dollars in cash for burning the house to the ground, and payment after the job is finished, They decide on a date for tomorrow night, around 3-4AM.

3:00 A.M.

The sedan creeps down the street, headlights off. They cut the engine and let it die. The car ticks as it cools, metal settling into silence.

Donovan steps out first. Baggy black cargos stuffed into boots, suspenders hanging over a plain shirt. A rifle slung across his back, heavy. Beretta M9 on his hip, flashlight fixed under the barrel. Military posture in a quiet suburb.

Kit slips out the passenger side, wearing all black.

He looks like the dark itself. He opens the trunk, hauls out the duffel, the zipper rattling like a warning. Gas cans, chemicals, oily rags, a handful of firecrackers.

The house waits at the end of the driveway. Dark. Hollow. For Sale sign tilted in the grass, sun-bleached No Trespassing nailed to the fence. The kind of place that feels emptied of air.

They cut across the ditch, boots crunching leaves. Kit notices the breaker box. It has a pad-lock.

The carport stretches along the cement drive. They notice the sliding glass door that leads into the living room. Locked.

Donovan pulls the Beretta. Clicks the light on. Pops one round. Glass shatters, raining over the concrete in sharp little teeth.

They step inside. Careful steps over broken glass. Flashlights sweeping, guns drawn.

The house smells stale, like carpet and dust. Big mirrors reflect their beams back at them. Wide rooms. Vaulted ceilings. Built in the 80s, still carrying that weird family comfort.

Their flash lights cutting through the darkness.

Kit kneels, drops the duffel. Starts pulling gear. Gas cans. Matches. Firecrackers. He lines them up like tools on a workbench.

Don shines his light down the hallway. Checks each corner. Empty. Just beige walls, carpet, old wallpaper peeling in the dining room. The house has been stripped, but the bones are still here.

Kit twists a gas can open, the fumes spilling out sharp.

They pour, gasoline soaking deep into the carpet, dark stains spreading. Kit shoves firecrackers in the corner, sticks a rag like a fuse.

Don glances at a cracked wall mirror. His flashlight catches his reflection.

The house breathes gasoline.

Kit lights a test fuse. Smoke curls up. His voice is low. “One thousand bucks feels cheap for something this big.”

The fire begins to spread, and Don and Kit run out.

Segment II: The Repo Job.

After torching the house, Don and Kit get tipped off to another job on the forum. This one’s from a man who just lost everything in a bitter divorce. His ex-wife kept the car he loved, a cherry-red ’71 Chevelle, and then bragged about her new boyfriend driving it around town. For $800, He wants it gone. No questions asked.

The boys take him up on his offer.

3:15AM.

The street’s quiet. No cars, no lights on, just the two of them pulling up to the driveway. Don cuts the engine and kills the headlights. The car ticks as it cools.

Kit crouches behind some bushes near the garage. Don is right behind him, rifle on his back, Beretta at his side. They move slow, careful, knowing every sound carries.

The garage has a simple padlock. Kit pulls out a set of picks from his pocket and starts working it. A couple of clicks, some pressure, and the lock pops. He motions Don over. No words. Just a nod.

Inside, the garage smells like oil, dust, and old tires. The ’71 Chevelle sits tight against the shelves, the paint dull in the weak light from a single bulb overhead. Kit moves along the side, checking corners, workbenches, and boxes. Don crouches behind the car, flashlight sweeping rims, tires, windows.

“Keys?” Don asks, voice low.

Kit slides the center console open, grabs a small envelope with the registration, and tucks it into his jacket. “All clear.""

They slide the Chevelle out carefully, inch by inch, along the driveway so the engine won’t start inside the garage and wake anyone up. Kit kneels beside the ignition, signaling Don.

“Stay inside. Keep an eye on the house. Any movement, any sound, you signal me.”

Don nods, moves back into the garage and gently opens the door that leads inside. He steps quietly, boots whispering over the wood floors. The house is normal—furniture, TV, books, nothing flashy. No alarms, no surprises.

He notices a slice of bread on the counter. Shrugs. Pops it in the toaster.

Cut to Kit outside, crouched at the wheel, patiently trying the ignition without revving it. Sparks, clicks, nothing.

Cut back to Don, nibbling toast, chewing slow, alert. Silence except for the faint ticking of the toaster and the subtle sound of his boots on the floor.

Curiosity wins. He creeps upstairs on tiptoe, scanning the hallway, hands brushing the railing.

Then a sound. From the bedroom.

A low, unmistakable moan. Female. Followed by rhythmic pounding.

Don freezes, grimaces, disgusted, then carefully retreats down the stairs as quietly as he can. Boots soft on the wood, body tense.

Outside, he meets Kit, who hasn’t moved a muscle.

Kit finally gets the ignition to catch. The engine hums low, no revving, no sudden noise. Don slides behind the wheel, shifting smoothly. Kit rides shotgun, scanning the backroads, eyes sharp.

They take the Chevelle off the driveway, careful not to hit gravel or make a sound, hugging the shadows. The night smells of mud and wet leaves.

Minutes later, they reach a remote swamp, thick with reeds and soft mud, a place nobody would ever think to check. Don guides the car slowly, inch by inch, until the tires sink, then the hubcaps, then the body, swallowing it whole. Water and mud cover the chrome. The Chevelle is gone, lost to the black swamp.

They climb out, boots muddy, chest heaving from adrenaline, but grinning. Don lights a cigarette.

“Clean,” he says.

Kit wipes his hands on his cargos, smirking. “Too easy.”

Segment III: The Warning

The fourth forum job isn’t fire or theft like the last -- it’s intimidation. Denny Rogers, a greasy loan shark who runs his racket out of a billiards hall, posts the job. Randall Corbin owes him a pile, and Denny wants the reminder delivered loud enough that Randall pisses himself but quiet enough the cops don’t get wind.

Don and Kit take it. They track Randall to a neon-soaked nightclub, bass rattling the walls. The crowd is a mess of perfume, sweat, and cheap vodka.

They push through until Kit spots Randall and some random woman slipping into the bathroom. Don pounds on the last stall door.

RANDALL (muffled, grunting): “Occupied, asshole!”

Don slams his boot through the lock. The door flies open, revealing Randall, shirt untucked, pants tangled at his knees, a girl crouched in front of him on the filthy tile. Her lipstick is smeared, her eyes wide. Randall curses, trying to cover himself.

DON (cold, raising the Beretta): “Out of the way, girlie.”

The girl bolts, heels clattering on the tile. Kit plants himself at the bathroom door, pistol low but ready. Don presses the barrel in-between Randall's eyes.

DON:

“Denny says you’re outta time. Next knock won’t be a warning.”

Randall trembles, fumbling his zipper up with shaking hands.

KIT (smirking, low):

“Tick, tick, tick.”

After leaving Randall trembling in the bathroom stall, Don and Kit head to the bar inside the club. The bass rattles their chests, neon lights reflecting off spilled drinks. They slide onto bar stools, order beers with their fake IDs, and let themselves relax a little. Kit sips cautiously, scanning the crowd for trouble. Don downs half his beer in one gulp, laughing, shaking his head at the absurdity of what just happened.

Finally, they leave through the main entrance, stepping out into the empty streets. The chilly night air hits them.

Don notices a young, buxom woman being sexually harassed by an older, sleazy man. He steps in gently at first, politely telling the man to back off. When the man pushes and mocks him, Don’s soft-hearted patience snaps — he beats the guy mercilessly, leaving him bleeding and humiliated. The woman escapes safely, and Kit smirks at Don’s brutal efficiency. The encounter shows Don’s moral code: he’s compassionate but will not tolerate injustice, even on the streets.

Don strolls into the diner late at night, the neon sign flickering outside painting the empty booths in pink and blue. Luna’s behind the counter, effortlessly juggling orders, and he can’t resist tossing her a sarcastic joke. She fires back, sharp and playful, and just like that, the night hums with easy laughter. He lingers, helping her refill coffee, swapping stories with regulars, leaning on the counter, and Don eats a killer omelette, and for a few hours, the weight of their pasts feels a little lighter.

Segment IV: The Contract

Kit spends hours in the pawn shop’s back office, scrolling shady forums. He finds a post by Nico Riggs offering five thousand dollars to kill Vicki Ramirez, Nico Riggs wants his ex-wife dead to collect a life insurance payout and recoup losses from recent divorce settlements and court costs. The post is sloppy, bitter, and chillingly real.

The terms are simple. A small amount of crypto sits in escrow. The rest releases only after proof of death. The client wants Vicki’s phone and a photo of a playing card laid on her body.

Kit is hesitant at first. Donovan sees five thousand dollars and a way to rescue Luna. Vicki had a life insurance policy. Nico believes her death is the only way to recover the money she took in the divorce.

The Plan

They stage it as a burglary. They steal a car, wear gloves, take a .38 revolver for noise control, and a 9mm as backup. Tuesday night is chosen because Vicki usually returns from the salon late.

The plan is to cut power to lights and cameras, take the phone, drop the card, and leave without being seen.

What Goes Wrong

Vicki is not alone. Her boyfriend has two friends over watching a game.

The doorbell camera still works on battery and records their faces in partial profile. A fragment of the stolen car’s plate is captured. A neighbor hears a struggle and calls 911. Patrol cars arrive early.

Inside, the boyfriend rushes Donovan. The .38 misfires on a bad round. Donovan switches to the 9mm. Kit is tackled. A second shot ricochets and kills one of the friends.

Vicki grabs a knife and slashes Donovan’s arm. Kit shoots her. Donovan places the playing card on her body and takes her phone to satisfy the forum’s proof requirements.

They flee but drop a glove in the yard. DNA is left behind. The doorbell camera has recorded everything.

Vicki is dead, but the scene is far from clean. Three additional deaths occur. The news calls it a massacre. The forum freezes the escrow. Nico deletes his account. There is no payout, only a manhunt.

Escape

Traffic cameras and the doorbell footage catch the stolen Civic. Gas-station footage shows Donovan buying gauze and hydrogen peroxide twenty minutes after the murders.

The 9mm casings match ammo Kit recently resold from the pawn shop. Detectives begin canvassing the strip mall. Witnesses recognize Donovan and Kit.

If they stay, they will be caught. They take cash from the pawn shop, ditch the Civic, and hop a freight train heading west.

The Road

They travel through Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, changing cars often. They lift wallets at truck stops. They sleep wherever they can, hitchhike, crash nightclubs and bars frequently, steal cars, hop freight trains, and avoid law enforcement at every turn, they first hop a freight town to escape and ditch their car.

Hitchhiking

Donovan and Kit leap from a slow-moving freight train onto a gravel shoulder. Their legs burn, arms are scraped, and hearts hammer.

A beat-up Honda pulls over. Morgan leans out the window. She sees the cuts and fear but does not ask questions. She lets them in.

Inside the car, they whisper jokes and share a smoke, trying to calm down. For a moment, the world feels normal. By dawn, Morgan drops them at a roadside motel. She leaves a map marked with backroads and a small trace of human kindness before disappearing.

Billy

On the streets next to a casino, Billy Tran is running with a duffel bag. He has ripped a rigged dice game and owes dangerous people.

Donovan and Kit corner him, expecting an easy score. Billy offers the car, cash, and himself. By midnight, the three of them are driving down empty streets, reckless but feeling free.

Town-to-Town

By the time they reach Lafayette, fear and tension weigh heavily on them. They juggle fake IDs, crowded clubs, and the constant fear of recognition.

“What is Love” blares on a club speaker, a cruel reminder of the carefree life they no longer have. A stripper’s keys provide the next getaway. News updates flash on phones and TVs: four dead in Georgia, two juveniles wanted, police warn they are armed and dangerous.

Who is on Their Trail

Ulrick Birch, a private investigator hired by Vicki’s sister, tracks the boys through eyewitness reports, gas-station surveillance, and pawn shop records. He shadows their movements quietly, piecing together their trail from what people say and what they leave behind.

Loris Delmar, a bounty hunter, is after Billy for skipping bond on the casino scam. Loris does not care about the murders, only bringing Billy in.

Local and state police coordinate once the doorbell footage circulates. The manhunt intensifies. The case is no longer a whodunit. It is a dragnet.

Themes

1nbmc4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1nbmc4c/how_i_overcome_the_where_do_i_even_start_feeling/,How I overcome the ‘where do I even start?’ feeling when cleaning,"I used to stare at my messy apartment and feel completely overwhelmed. You know that feeling when everything looks chaotic and you literally don't know where to begin? I'd end up procrastinating for hours (or days... don't judge me 😅).

Here's what actually helped me break through that paralysis:

**1. Take a photo of your space first**

* Sounds weird, but seeing it through a camera lens gives you an objective view
* You'll notice what's actually bothering you most vs. what you think is the problem

**2. Start with the tiniest possible task**

* Empty one trash can
* Put away ONE item
* Wipe down just the coffee table
* The goal isn't to clean everything - it's just to START

**3. Ditch the ""perfect clean"" mindset**

* I used to think I needed 3+ hours to make it ""worth it""
* Now I aim for ""slightly better than before""
* Progress > perfection

**4. Focus on high-impact areas first**

* Clear surfaces (desk, counters) show immediate visual change
* Floor space - even just picking up clothes makes a huge difference
* These give you that motivational boost to keep going

**5. Set a stupid-short timer**

* 5-10 minutes max
* You can do ANYTHING for 5 minutes
* Often you'll want to continue once you start, but if not - that's totally fine!

The key insight for me was realizing that the ""overwhelm"" was worse than the actual cleaning. Once I started treating it like tiny experiments instead of major projects, everything changed.

This morning, when I was lying in bed, dreading getting up because I know how stiff I've been lately.   I started thinking about what has changed during that time. What's changed is that after 5 years of being an over-the-road truck driver, I got a new job last October as a waitress. I was miserable as a truck driver because I felt isolated and missed my homelife. Plus, I was team driving with my husband, with whom I have worked together since we were married 35 years ago. I needed space! As a truck driver, I would get a large coffee, add sugar, and drive. That was my one cup for the day. 

Now at home, I drink coffee, maybe 4 cups throughout the day, sometimes 5. BUT I have a lot of sugar. I'm embarrassed to say almost a quarter cup of sugar with each cup. So I started thinking that's really what's changed. I don't eat a lot of sweets. I eat mostly healthy, and a lot of the time, only 2 meals a day. My shifts at work typically are anywhere between 3 to 5 hours a day. I get home between lunch and dinner time so I'll snack on almonds or cucumbers...small things because I eat dinner around 6 pm.

 Has anyone cut back on table sugar and seen a difference? I had a cup this morning with sugar. I'm on my second cup, and I only put milk in it. I did a little research this morning, and research shows coffee on its own is not really bad for RA, but sugar is. Milk in moderation has anti-inflammatory agents. The research also said to try natural sugars in moderation, like Stevia, honey, or real maple syrup. I'd rather use milk and cut the sugar out completely for now. I want to see if that's the culprit.

Has anyone actually made dietary changes and felt the difference? I mean, ten years and mostly flare-free. Sugar is the only thing that has changed for me. Way too much.

CONGRATS ON THE WEDDING

First off this is kind of a weird move for me to post here since gf is the one who showed me this community, but I'm genuinely dumbfounded and lost on how to proceed with anything given what is to follow. I suppose in some sense it's an aita and seeking advice at the same time.

In late 2021 I met gf online as at the time we were both experimenting with content creation, we had a lot of shared interests and vibed well, however we were on opposite sides (like look straight down level opposite) of the planet and she was trapped in an abusive marriage she'd been attempting to exit for a couple years.

As time went on I came to be of the opinion that if her and her ""adopted"" daughter (his niece, unwell sister) didn't get out soon he'd snap and do them both in, abuse was pretty obvious and continuing to escalate.

I'd been looking for a framework to get out of my birth country for a long time (she's from the same country but emigrated over a decade earlier) so we hatched a plan that I'd leverage most of (sigh, I know) my resources to buy a property in the same neighborhood as she was living in, which she could ""rent"" one of the buildings on to use to start a business and work her way out of the situation he'd had her trapped in while also providing a place for her to flee when he escalated and hang out etc.

So around six months in to the situationship I flew 30 hours or so to the opposite side of the planet with pretty much no idea what I was doing to buy a house in a foreign country the first time I'd ever even left my country. I have a tendency to jump into the deep end, clearly. And, with some hickups here and there, it worked, we hung out, I rented an airbnb nearby while the paperwork went through on the house, he continued to escalate, she fled child in tow to my airbnb, and eventually I managed to take posession of the house, which I totally got scammed on but whatever it was legitimately like 20x cheaper than where I'm from (I'd never be able to own real estate in my wildest dreams where I was born) and we moved in and I fixed the place up. The stuff of movies yeah?

However, while all this was going on she lost her job which was meant to support things while everything shook out, I burned up all my savings, had friends liquidate most of my assets (I didn't have much but it went a lot further in the new area) and her ex in process started a bunch of fraudulent/illegal court cases to make things appear more serious than they were. So, having run out my visa extension and savings, I returned to \[insert birth country here\] to make money while she sorted things out on her end and got set up so I could return on a more long term visa.

Only she didn't, it's now the tail end of 2025 and she still hasn't found a job, and she still hasn't sorted out her own visa (one of the ways he was controlling her). Really all she has managed to do is finalize a restraining order against him after wasting a ton of my money on the worst law firm imaginable (like actually criminal, there are proceedings against them now) after I repeatedly tried to help steer things in a more helpful direction. My feedback on this and many more subjects was pretty much unwelcome. I would send money for things like fixing a crack in the wall, fixing the security system (which she was constantly reminding me she felt unsafe because he had toyed with the idea of hiring a hit man for his previous ex) fixing the pool so the social workers would calm down etc, and none of it would ever get done. I know she had it hard trying to deal with everything herself, but I was sending her 2.5-3x the average salary of someone local AND I was paying rent/mortgage separately.

Meanwhile I was being worked to death by one of the most exploitative companies to ever exist (who are also getting sued left and right) destroying my body and getting proper injured, despite my best efforts, to support her while trapped in a country that is rapidly trying to turn itself into national socialism the reduxening. It was supposed to be three months, not three years, granted that was optimistic.

So as things really started to come to a head in \[insert birth country here\] and the visa rules were about to change in \[insert prospective new home country here\] due to the issues globally we hatched a new plan. I'd have to return before the rules changed or it would be a lot harder to make my way back, we'd both apply for asylum as now there was clear cause for it, and that would allow us to do more traditional work to stay afloat. I landed 10 days ago.

I'd had my concerns and my reservations, I would have left if it wasn't for the house at many points, while we'd still played games together and stayed in near daily contact we'd had a lot of rough patches. I didn't feel like she was taking things seriously, doing her fair share, or acting with the regard a well adjusted adult would, and I felt undervalued and taken advantage of. I'm not really sure how to word a lot of this but I just felt like things had not gone they way they should have all along, but still, I had to grain of salt because I wasn't there, and she was dealing with a system stacked against her with a traumatized child on a big property by herself. Though I did feel that if she had done what she was supposed to I would have been there to support her much sooner. The main thing was she was constantly having mental health issues, which is warranted and fair, but she refused to get proper help for any consistent period, despite making most of the gains she did in the few months she actually talked to a therapist. Anything I asked for or suggested was anathema, and I felt like I was the enemy.

Soon comes the part where it goes from life sucks, things are hard, other people have it worse, maybe I'm being too harsh etc to true mind blownedness.

After traveling for 46 hours--including being detained and sleeping all day on a dirty bench at immigrations because I had the audacity to request the officers adhere to their constitutional obligation to issue an asylum seekers transit permit in order for the proper authorities to evaluate the claim (they didn't, I entered on an exemption, legally)--she picked me up after struggling for an hour and a half to secure transport while I sat there getting eyed up clutching all my remaining worldly belongings and we went to the house, she asked me to sit down and talk to her before we went in.

Sidebar--To be clear, the country I arrived to is a place I truly love, but it also deals with the legacy of interference from the country I've fled and it's allies. Things are hard, and while the people I truly believe to be made of more fair and honest stuff functioning within a system that's far more humanitarian, things here aren't a picnic either, just better than a place that's collapsing violently while making enemies of the entire planet. So it wasn't great that she left me standing there after having consistent updates the whole time holding everything I own while people were looking at me knowing they might go home hungry.

So I sit down

She tells me things really got away from her while I was gone, she has her ""adopted"" daughter beg me not to leave them. I promised nothing and said clearly that I can't make a promise without knowing what it is I'm promising about, and that they were freaking me out. I'm kind of an a\*hole for that, the kid is seven, but why did gf even put me in that position when I was in such a compromised state.

Mind you, the whole relationship she wouldn't shut up about her ex to the point where I pretty much said if you are going to talk about your ex don't talk to me at all, so I know his house is full of cat poop and dead animals and he was illegally taking child there against court orders and how he blamed her for it even after she'd been gone three years etc and all that has been corroborated

But she said this from the stance of the property I'd gotten to help her was spotless, so hey, even if she was messing up literally everything else at least she was sortof doing something right?

It was a crime scene.

Like those hoarder shows on tv, youtube, whatever? Yeah at or beyond that level.

Her parents had come to visit a year or so in so I know it hadn't been like that all along.

There was poop, there was mold, there were bugs, the entire bottom floor is water damaged.

You could not see the floor.

There was rotting desiccated meat on the counter.

She had been telling her parents the house was perfect and she was about to take a video for the social workers.

Turns out the money was going to buying stuff, losing it in the hoard, and buying it again. There were hundreds of dollars of unopened groceries rotting and buried in all of it.

I spent two days dealing with as much of it as possible, the kid would still be worse off if the government took her and the whole rest of the family rejected her already partly cause racism, partly cause unc (ex) is a full blown narcissistic psycho and rages out on anyone who tries to help cause he wants to hurt gf. So that was priority number one. I couldn't even physically get to the shower to clean myself for the first time in half the circumference of the planet until day three of cleaning. She helped a lot day one, admitted she was delusional which I don't even know how to begin to address that, I asked if she talked to anyone about it and she said her mom, so I talked to her mom secretly (this became a big issue later, she hadn't told her squat and then her dad got involved and they have a strained relationship) cause like what was I supposed to do, I'm one person, and clearly I was not who I needed to be and she was in way deeper than anyone knew and needed support and monitoring.

Day two she still did a good amount but not as much and then she accidentally hurt herself, conveniently as always happens. The injury itself is real but this is a pattern that has played out all along. Since then she's pushed through the pain some and done some each day (we got stuff for it, I'm not a monster, I think, but this also isn't my horrific mess and I'm still the injured party here) but she makes promises she can't keep, as has been an issue the entire relationship, pretty much if she says she'll do something or I ask for something those are the two ways to guarantee it won't happen.

So day three I asked her mom to talk to her. Her mom sent a supportive message being like yo wtf but hey I'm here for you and this has to get fixed. If they could her parents would be coming to help but it just isn't an option right now. So then gf was gonna leave and come back to clean, to which I said you aren't even getting it done without the travel. Many fights ensued over the following days, and I told her she's in no position to be getting indignant with me. I should have just turned around and left, maybe even pressed charges, not tried to save her AGAIN from losing the child she's been raising since birth.

I suppose in posting this knowing if it makes it into a video she'll see it is asking for another big blow up. But I mean, you know like don't do the crime if you can't do the time and she's practically getting it swept under the rug for her, which I have moral issues with.

Day 10 the microkitchen is still biohazard level unsafe, but other than that what can be fixed mostly is, though she still hasn't touched the room where she was keeping the dog she refused to send me a picture of until it was gone, whole other issue I almost left over--I've tried deep cleaning it twice and it's still gnarly, that's another part that is just destroying me morally. She's having all kinds of attitude issues and mood swings despite how I've taken a major part of the burden off of her. We're vaguely getting along. I told her I don't see how I could possibly continue this relationship after witnessing child abuse, animal abuse, financial abuse, vandalism et all. She had a major freakout at that, I mean I'll admit I'm a very facts based blunt task oriented person but like in this instance, my charitability is being shown in my actions I don't have the energy to mince words. We do stuff together, she cooks, and makes coffee. Partly cause the kitchen isn't in a state yet where I can even figure out how to do it myself and frankly it just disgusts me to the point where I have trouble trying. I'm probably kind of a jerk on that front but sue me.

She still hasn't gotten her asylum stuff to a point where she can legally look for avenues to support herself, I already wanted to sell this property and move into something smaller and more manageable closer to kids school, in her name instead of mine this time, before any of this transpired.

Now I kind of want to just sell and leave, I haven't started the asylum process yet so I have the option. I might be denaturalized and sent to torture prison if I go back, but I'm also the complexion the new regime likes so I might squeak through, even though I have a record of battling their horrifically violent hateful bs. Also while I was traveling my step mom died twice and got resuscitated despite having a DNR and now my dad is dealing with that on his own, though honestly I probably wouldn't be able to help him much even if I was there. He was planning to move this way as well once my step mom passes, and if I don't start the asylum process it would be a lot easier to come back with him as his caretaker when the time comes.

The kid adores me, but to be honest her behavior is pretty extreme too at this point, gf let her walk all over her while I was gone, and I'm not really prepared to do worst case scenario level parenting on top of trying to keep gf from falling apart and risking everything falling on me again.

Word is they were about to give her full custody though so if she suddenly has to move that may jeopardize things.

So yeah, I'm sure I left out an absolute ton but I'm at this point where I don't know whether to try to stay, either doing asylum alone which I don't really want to, trying to salvage this mess which I don't really want to, going back and ending up in prison for being a dissident which I don't really want to or if I squeak through probably getting nuked cause the country I'm from is truly awful on the world stage and antagonizing everyone on top of being irrational and run by racist misogynist drunks playing with the big red button--which I don't really want to. I honestly just hate my fellow countrypeople so I don't want to be there for that reason even if the rest is pure hysteria--it's not, because they're all about how to screw over the person next to you to get ahead, just going outside is a case study in antisocial behavior.

So yeah that's my aita, seeking advice, vent, whatever it is. I've got a month or two to figure out my plan before the visa gets too short, meanwhile everything devolves by the day and if we don't figure something out we'll be going hungry soon. I'm going to talk to a real estate agent about selling as soon as I post this, I'll get less than I paid even with inflation probably, and I'll be underwater on the mortgage and who knows if they'll even let me take the money back out of the country but if I can get a clean break it would be worth it, even if I have to spend some time cleaning it up, like I played a stupid game and won a stupid prize I guess, even if my intentions were good.",15,1757334056.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,0.9,False

32 years old. Female. 120lbs. 5’4”. Non smoker. Not pregnant. No meds other than vitamin and probiotics. No current or past medical issues, but I do suspect some hormonal bowel issues…


I have occasional stomach upset/discomfort. It usually aligns with my period or ovulation. The worst of it is just before ovulation or just before my period. I’ve always assumed it’s hormones. Usually manifests as unexplained diarrhea and stomach pain (ie, I didn’t eat terrible the day before, didn’t drink a ton of alcohol, etc). 

I’ve never really been concerned because it seems pretty consistent with the timing, but I guess I’m just anxious today. Tell me this doesn’t look like coffee ground stool, please! It is straight liquid on the way out, and I have some stomach discomfort but again this is normal for me around this time of the month. I don’t take any regular meds, just a multi vitamin and probiotic.

She is two years older than him, they belong to two different religions, they are polar opposite by personality. Met on the first day of work somewhere in the early 1990s, and over three decades later, I doubt they have willingly spent one day apart.

One day, we were having a drink, and he told me he wanted to marry her the day he saw her for the first time. After dating for two years, he proposed while they were sitting in the office canteen and having rajma chawal. He asked, ""We have free time this afternoon, do you want to get married?"", to which she replied, ""Okay, we can get married today, but Special Marriage Act needs one month notice for registration"". No frill, no fluff. They went with four friends, got married that afternoon.....and went back to work the very next day (LOL!!) 

They resumed work immediately because they were already living together and didn't understand the concept of a honeymoon; instead using that money to invest and buy the house where I was raised. Those primitive years set a beautiful foundation to build my life brick by brick. 

When my mum told my dad she was pregnant, he said, ""Great news, now I'll have one more friend!"" And I believe this story. That's how they treat me. I spent a lot of time in my childhood resenting them because, despite their wonderful traits, they were never serious about parenting. They were never around a whole lot due to their full-time jobs. In my adulthood, I can appreciate them more. They are smart. I'm talking about freakishly smart and ridiculously talented individuals.

It's not gone unnoticed that he has never cracked a wife joke. Never. When friends and relatives chat and crack jokes on ""women, eh?"" or ""wives, eh?"", I've noticed him fidget with his phone or look away. She has a tight friend circle where they whine and crib about their husbands allllllll theeeeeee timeeeee. Honestly, even as a joke, I have never heard her utter a bad thing about my father. Not once. 

They are friends, best friends! I have seen love between them, but I also see genuine fondness and respect. They extend that to me too. While I see peers getting pressured into marrying and producing babies quickly (we are all approaching 30), mine remind me often how crucial personal happiness is and they want me to be happy, irrespective of my personal definition of it. 

I genuinely love hanging out with them! For example, yesterday we were sipping on scotch while talking about Hemingway, solipsism, and the history of coffee in India. Three topics completely different from one another and each one of us had something to talk about them. In my drunk stupor, I realised how fortunate I am. I don't think discussions like these are common. Are they?

I see my friends' parents - most of them had arranged marriages, some of them had love marriages. With time, many of them have become wonderful companions. 

But my parents? I LOVE LOVE LOVE being in the same room as them just to experience their love. There's so much comfort, admiration, banter, random living room dances, smiley smiles. They are giddily happy. I think that's the difference - I see other couples content and at peace. My parents are two madhatters in passionate love, the kind sonnets are written for and about. Every other story pales in comparison and sets my expectations bar unrealistically high. Why settle for someone who doesn't look at you like you're magic? 

PS: He gifts her gladioli on her birthday. I know for a fact that roses are her favourite flowers. I suspect it's an inside joke because of the way she giggles on receiving them.

1nbm3nl,https://www.inforum.com/news/moorhead/moorheads-red-raven-coffee-shop-to-close-at-end-of-september,https://www.inforum.com/news/moorhead/moorheads-red-raven-coffee-shop-to-close-at-end-of-september,"MOORHEAD — A Moorhead coffee shop is closing, with co-operators citing a lack of resources and support from the shop’s legal owners.

In a post on social media on Friday, Sept. 5, The Red Raven announced the shop will be closing at the end of September.

“We found ourselves as the last two people of what had been an eight member team,” the post read. “This work is not sustainable with two people, especially when we are volunteering our time and effort, and we were not given the tools or the resources needed in order to sustain the shop long term.”

While the shop was billed as a co-op, with multiple employee-owners, it never operated that way, co-operator Margaret McKenzie-Ray told The Forum.

“When me and my co-operators signed on, we never anticipated being fully in charge of any of these things,” McKenzie-Ray said. “It was supposed to be, again, a collective of people all taking on responsibilities and helping each other.”

The shop is closing about a year and a half after it moved to Moorhead. The shop has historically been a hub for members of the LGBTQ+ community, artists and local activists.

The Red Raven Espresso Parlor first opened in 2005 on Roberts St. in Fargo. Five years later, it moved to 916 Main Ave. in Fargo. The business lost its lease at the Main Avenue location in 2022. It reopened in a strip mall off Main Avenue in Moorhead in February 2024.

After opening in Moorhead, the Red Raven also operated BLK Cat Studios two doors down in the same building, which was intended to be an artist space and music venue.

McKenzie-Ray came on as a volunteer in March 2024, and said she was told employees would eventually be paid. However, volunteers were never paid, McKenzie-Ray said.

The business opened without a working espresso machine, McKenzie-Ray said. The shop’s location did not attract regular foot traffic, while BLK Cat Studios was not set up for artists or shows, she added. Without revenue from the artist’s space, the business pays for additional space without generating revenue from it.

All of the money generated from the coffee shop went to paying the two leases, McKenzie-Ray said. Workers had to chip in to cover rent and utilities.

“You can’t simultaneously have what is supposed to be a free, pay-what-you-can, all-inclusive, no-one-turned-away-for-lack-of-funds space, and then be paying a commercial landlord,” McKenzie-Ray said.

LexX Francis, one of the people whose name is on the leases, said they stepped away from the business around two years ago due to safety concerns and not feeling like their voice was being heard or respected.

Francis was one of the owners in the Red Raven’s previous location and helped it move to Moorhead. They said they agree the way the shop has been run is not sustainable, equitable or safe for its workers.

“I’d say that there are many sides to each story, and I’m not trying to say ‘well, this happened to me, so it had to happen to you,’ but I was also never given resources,” Francis said.

Francis said the shop was less-than-inclusive because of the lack of transgender people and people of color involved in the collective. They said others with names on the leases stepped away from the business around the same time.

“I hope that this doesn’t deter people from wanting to organize and continuing to try to build in community, because we can ask ourselves to be better,” Francis said of the shop’s closing.

McKenzie-Ray said updates about the shop’s hours will be posted on the shop’s Instagram page, u/redravenep.

The coffee shop will host three last events before closing: Underdogs Doodle Club from 6-8 p.m. on Sept. 16, FM Craft Club from 5-8 p.m. on Sept. 19 and Sacred Chaos Political Collage DIY from 12-2 p.m. on Sept. 20.",22,1757333726.0,fargo,10,0.92,False
