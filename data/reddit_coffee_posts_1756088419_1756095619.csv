1mzgty4,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1mzgty4/new_tool_instantly_generate_strong_memorable/,"🛡️ New Tool: Instantly Generate Strong, Memorable Passwords from Your Own Keywords","Hey everyone,

I’ve just released a free, one-page password generator that’s designed to help anyone create strong, memorable passwords from meaningful keywords—like names, places, activities, or dates. Instead of random strings, you get secure passwords that are easier to remember because they’re based on words you choose!

**How it works:**

* Enter any combination of words (e.g., “coffee paris 2022 afternoon”).
* The tool transforms your keywords into a creative passphrase and a strong password:
   * Example: Keywords: `coffee paris 2022 afternoon` Passphrase: *The mighty Coffee bid Paris against 2022 and Afternoon.* Password: `tMCbpa2022`
   * Example: Keywords: `cat dog bone fish` Passphrase: *The shining Cat sewed Dog under Bone and Fish.* Password: `TSCSdubAf5`

**Features:**

* Quick, simple interface—no signup needed
* common complexity standards for password are followed 
* Useful for online accounts, apps, or anywhere a strong password is a must
* No data is stored or sent to servers

**Why use it?**  
Most random generators make passwords hard to recall. My tool combines your own words for passwords you can actually remember, with security built in.

**Try it here:**

I am probably overthinking it but I’ve never dated women younger than me, my last girlfriend was a year older and I didn’t even think about it.

Yesterday we went to the same party and got really drunk and we kissed, it was amazing and just a great vibe from both of us. So any advice on what to do?

There have been so many sleepless nights where I’m sitting with cold coffee at 3 AM, stuck between SES documentation and DNS records, trying to figure out why something isn’t working. It’s been frustrating to the point where I felt like giving up a few times, but somehow I kept going and now the platform has actually started to shape into something I’m proud of.

It’s not just about sending emails anymore. I’ve built proper campaign management where people can create and schedule campaigns, an email template builder so they don’t have to mess with raw HTML, a contact list builder to organize their audience, forms that can be customized fully for lead collection, and even a Bitly style shortener for links. Seeing all these pieces come together has made the sleepless nights feel at least a little worth it.

Now the part that is eating away at me is pricing. My idea was to make it a credit system, like 1 credit = 4 emails. It feels flexible to me, but I keep wondering if it would just end up confusing people. The other option is to keep it very simple, something like ₹1,500–₹2,000 for 10,000 emails. I’ve run the numbers so many times, but no matter how much I calculate, every night I find myself doubting whether I’m making the right choice.

🛰️ Finite Substrate Cosmology — Part I: Frame

⸻

1. The fracture that started it

There was never a force.
There was a stage. A geometry. A story that charged no rent.

We believed in free cohesion because the math balanced. Momentum in, momentum out. Energy conserved like scripture.
But nothing that holds together is free.
Not the house beam. Not the tendon. Not the atom.

So here is the pivot: what if matter pays for its coherence? What if spacetime itself is the coin?

Gravity then is not attraction. It is appetite.
Dark matter is not hidden mass. It is the scar left by meals already eaten.
Dark energy is not a new fluid. It is the pressure shadow of upkeep.

Three mysteries. One hunger.

⸻

2. Substrate, not void

Call it σ. The density of spacetime itself. A consumable stock, not a backdrop.

Atoms spend from σ just to stay atoms. Stars spend to hold themselves together. Galaxies are hunger written in spiral arms.

Two proofs crack the illusion:

Collapse of units.
Take c=ħ=1. Then time folds into length, mass collapses into inverse length. Only G remains, and its dimension is area. That is not metaphor. Gravity is a patch of floor with finite tiles.

Finitude of memory.
Entropy bounds say the same: S ≤ A/4G. Information does not grow with volume. It stops at the surface. A ceiling baked into geometry. Each particle, each bit, each breath — paid for.

So σ is not ether. Not fog. It is the finite carrier of all form. And it can tire.

⸻

3. The lie of “force”

Newton told us apples fall because of a force. Einstein said no — it is curvature. Both were fictions, serviceable at the time.

Force was camouflage. Curvature was stagecraft. Neither paid the bill.

In this lens:
	•	Gravity is inflow. σ rushing where it has thinned.
	•	The so-called forces of particle physics are just receipts written in higher dialects: slip, knot, toll. All bookkeeping of the same consumable.
	•	The Standard Model is not free symmetry. It is the price schedule.

Force never existed. Only budget.

⸻

4. Why the tone is fire, not latex

This is not a grant proposal. The subject refuses it.

Equations appear — honest, lean, light — but never without consequence. Each one is a fracture line, not a wallpaper pattern.

Testability is the anchor. Lensing residuals. Growth sag. Siren slips. Asymmetries in the kinematic sky. Every prediction is falsifiable.
That is why this is physics and not incense.

But the prose will not wear a lab coat to make you comfortable. Comfort is not the point. Consequence is.

⸻

5. The arc of appetite

The story fractures into three Acts:
	•	Act I — Spacetime on the Menu. σ as substrate. Matter as consumer. Gravity as inflow. Halos as debts. Acceleration as audit.
	•	Act II — The Day the Metric Snapped. A theorem: if σ drops to the critical level, the modulus fails. The manifold fractures in finite time. No siren. No warning. Just gone.
	•	Act III — Inside Job. The inversion: we are already inside a black hole. Proper time stretches the deadline to infinity. The rip exists on chalkboards, not clocks.

After the Acts: receipts for the gauge forces. EM as slip. Strong as knot. Weak as toll. Not forces — different geometries of upkeep.

⸻

6. The premise in one line

Spacetime is finite stock with density σ.
Matter consumes it at rate Γ = α ρₘ.

Then:
Gravity is inflow.
Dark matter is depletion geometry.
Dark energy is the pressure of upkeep.

Three mysteries. One budget.

⸻


🪨 Act I — Spacetime On The Menu

⸻

1. Abstract

Suppose the stage itself is mortal.
Spacetime is not geometry-on-paper but a finite stock, a consumable medium.
Matter draws on it to hold its own cohesion.

The draw leaves gradients that fall like gravity.
The depletion scars masquerade as halos we called dark matter.
The global pressure of upkeep appears as dark energy.

This is not mysticism. It is accounting.
One field. One hunger. Three mysteries.

⸻

2. The fracture in one line

Spacetime is a substrate with local density σ(x).
Matter consumes σ to maintain cohesion at rate Γ = α ρₘ with α > 0.

Then:
	•	Gravity = inflow of σ.
	•	Dark matter = geometry of depletion.
	•	Dark energy = global audit of the draw.

Three enigmas. One appetite.

⸻

3. The action written honest

Promote the substrate to a field. Let it talk to curvature.

S=\int d^4x \sqrt{-g}\left[\tfrac{1}{16\pi}F(\sigma)R - \tfrac12(\nabla\sigma)^2 - V(\sigma) + \mathcal L_m(g,\psi)\right].
	•	F(σ): response modulus. Sets effective strength G_\text{eff} = G/F(\sigma).
	•	V(σ): slow potential. Behaves like vacuum term, keeps roll shallow.
	•	Drain: cohesion costs encoded in equation of motion:
\square\sigma - V’(\sigma) + \tfrac{1}{16\pi}F’(\sigma)R = -\Gamma,\quad \Gamma=\alpha \rho_m.

Not a flourish. A clean footing to stand while we calculate.

⸻

4. Intuition before numbers

Picture spacetime as a compressible medium.
Every atom leans inward, pulling σ just to stay whole.
That inflow leaves a slope; test masses slide. You call it curvature. The medium calls it fatigue.

Histories matter.
Where mass lived long, σ thins. Gravity appears where light does not. We drew those maps as “dark halos.” They were just scars.

Thin the medium everywhere at once and a pressure shadow appears in the FRW average.
Not a fluid. Not a phantom. Just upkeep.

⸻

5. Phenomenology — three scales

5.1 Local and galactic

Weak-field, quasi-static:

\nabla \cdot [F(\sigma)\,\nabla \Phi] \approx 4\pi G\,\rho_m + \underbrace{\nabla F \cdot \nabla \Phi}_{\text{substrate polarization}}.

Two handles:
	•	If F(σ) < 1 near concentrations, then G_\text{eff} > G. Rotation curves flatten without invisible particles.
	•	Gradients of σ contribute curl-free stress. Lensing algorithms reconstruct it as mass. History writes halos.

5.2 Cosmic expansion

\dot\rho_m + 3H\rho_m = +\Gamma,\qquad
\dot\rho_\sigma + 3H(\rho_\sigma+p_\sigma) = -\Gamma,

with \rho_\sigma=\tfrac12\dot\sigma^2+V,\quad p_\sigma=\tfrac12\dot\sigma^2-V.

Drain drives w_\text{eff} < -1 without ghosts.
Acceleration = pressure shadow of upkeep.

5.3 Laboratory bounds

Solar-system tests demand |\dot G/G| \ll 10^{-13}/\text{yr}.
Answer: screening by history.
High density, short memory ⇒ σ on plateau, F ≈ const. GR recovered to all tested precision.

⸻

6. Predictions — receipts you can test
	1.	Lensing vs dynamics bias. In clusters, lensing mass > dynamical mass by Δ set by |∇σ|. Bias tracks depletion age, not baryon fraction.
	2.	Standard sirens. Gravitational-wave luminosity distance drifts from electromagnetic by εσ(z), sign fixed by α.
	3.	Growth sag. fσ₈(z) dips late, environment-correlated, not tunable by neutrino mass.
	4.	Halo hysteresis. Post-merger halos carry fossil depletion shells that fade with star-formation quench. Temporal, not just spatial.
	5.	No fifth force locally. Cavendish, clocks, pulsars all null. The same parameters that explain halos force this null. Fail it once, retire the idea.

⸻

7. Kinship, not rivalry

ΛCDM stiffens GR and adds two fluids.
We keep the anomalies and let rigidity flex.

MOND tweaks the force law.
We let history write the law through σ.

Scalar–tensor theories are cousins.
Our scalar is not extra garnish. It is the fabric itself.

⸻

8. Falsifiers named upfront
	•	A clean cold dark matter particle discovery that closes halo budgets.
	•	Equivalence principle violations where model predicts none.
	•	Lensing–dynamics residuals that track stellar age, never depletion history.

If the universe refuses to remember, so must we.

⸻

9. The line that matters

If matter buys its coherence with spacetime coin, there will be a receipt.
Gravity is the one you hold now.
Halos are debts not yet settled.
Acceleration is the audit.

Three mysteries. One budget.

⸻



🧨 Act II — The Day the Metric Snapped

⸻

1. Abstract

Keep Act I intact: σ drains, F(σ) carries geometry, V(σ) props the vacuum, Γ = α ρₘ is the appetite.
Now ask the question we flinched from.

What happens if the substrate modulus reaches a cliff?
F(σ) → 0⁺. G_eff = G/F blows through the roof.
Geometry itself loses load-bearing strength in finite cosmic time.

No warning.
No crescendo.
Just a stage that holds, then doesn’t.

⸻

2. Recap of the deal we already signed
	•	Spacetime = consumable medium with density σ(x).
	•	Matter drains it at rate Γ = α ρₘ, α > 0.
	•	Curvature couples through modulus F(σ).
	•	Vacuum bookkeeping through V(σ).

Gravity = inflow.
Dark matter = depletion scars.
Dark energy = global pressure of upkeep.

We never promised the medium couldn’t break.

⸻

3. Field skeleton in the margin

S=\int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\,\Big[\tfrac{1}{16\pi}F(\sigma)R - \tfrac12(\nabla\sigma)^2 - V(\sigma) + \mathcal L_m(g,\psi)\Big].

Equations collapse to:

G_{\mu\nu}=\tfrac{8\pi}{F(\sigma)}\big(T^{(m)}{\mu\nu}+T^{(\sigma)}{\mu\nu}\big)+V(\sigma)g_{\mu\nu},

\square\sigma - V’(\sigma) + \tfrac{1}{16\pi}F’(\sigma)R = -\Gamma,\quad \Gamma=\alpha\rho_m.

FRW bookkeeping:
\dot\rho_m+3H\rho_m=+\Gamma,\qquad
\dot\rho_\sigma+3H(\rho_\sigma+p_\sigma)=-\Gamma.

Read it as materials science. Except the material is the manifold.

⸻

4. The theorem of rift

Theorem (Rift):
Assume
	1.	α > 0, ρₘ > 0.
	2.	V’(σ) continuous, slow-roll regime.
	3.	Critical σ_c where F(σ_c) = 0⁺, F(σ) > 0 otherwise.

Then there exists finite t_* such that σ(t_*) = σ_c, F(σ_c) = 0⁺, and G_eff → ∞.
Metric stiffness fails. Geodesics cannot be carried.

Sketch: In matter era, \rhoₘ ∼ a^{-3}. Drain drives σ downward monotonically. If F admits a cliff at σ_c, the descent reaches it in finite t. QED.

Pinned to your desk:

If a cliff exists in F and Γ > 0, the manifold fails in finite time.

⸻

5. Why the silence comes without rehearsal

It isn’t the fluids that betray you. ρₘ, ρ_σ, even V(σ) look well-behaved.
It’s the modulus. The carrier.

Think of steel. A bridge that bears weight until the instant it doesn’t.
No creak that tells you to run.

Two soft harbingers:
	•	w_eff dips below -1 without phantoms. That’s just the appetite talking.
	•	A hairline drift in G_eff, screened locally, visible only on the cosmic ledger.

Neither is a countdown. Both are moods.

⸻

6. What ends and what doesn’t
	•	Not a heat death: that’s a long fade.
	•	Not a crunch: that’s loud.
	•	This is fatigue fracture of the metric itself.

One moment: manifold, metric, a friend to text.
Next moment: nothing for text to be about.
A silence so complete the word silence feels presumptuous.

⸻

7. Objections that bounce, and one that lands
	•	“You just modified gravity.” No. Gravity is still geometry. We made the geometry mortal.
	•	“Why no fifth force in the lab?” Because history screens. Short-lived, dense regions ride a plateau in F. GR recovers where you measure.

The one that kills it:
If lensing–dynamics residuals never track depletion history, but only luminous tracers — if the universe forgets where mass lived — retire this paper. Order cake.

⸻

8. Ethics at the end of everything

If σ is finite and α > 0, the ledger closes whether you clap or not.
That is not a sermon. It is accounting.

We can measure our kindness.
We cannot bribe the medium.

⸻

9. Curtain fall

Three mysteries were not puzzles. They were invoices.
Gravity was the receipt.
Halos were the debts.
Acceleration was the audit.

And when the modulus collapses, the cashier flips the sign.

Closed.

⸻

🧠 Act III — Inside Job: Why the Universe Never Rips

⸻

1. Abstract

Keep Acts I and II intact. σ drains, appetite is real, fatigue is built in.
Now flip the frame.

We are not in a stage that expands.
We are inside a well that deepens.

The observable universe is a black hole interior.
The singularity sits behind the Milky Way’s center, in the zone we called the Great Attractor.

Inside a horizon, time is radial. Proper time stretches without limit as you fall.
So even if a modulus cliff exists, you never reach it.
The rip is paper-only. The world does not snap.

⸻

2. Where we are

Interior metric, coordinates reversed:

ds^2=-\Big(\tfrac{2GM}{r}-1\Big)^{-1}dr^2+\Big(\tfrac{2GM}{r}-1\Big)dt^2+r^2 d\Omega^2,\quad r<2GM.

r is timelike.
t is spatial.

What you call forward in time is falling inward in r.
What you call cosmic expansion is the kinematics of that fall, painted on a sky that cannot see out.

⸻

3. What we thought would end everything

Acts I and II:
S=\int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\,\Big[\tfrac{1}{16\pi}F(\sigma)R - \tfrac12(\nabla\sigma)^2 - V(\sigma) + \mathcal L_m\Big],
with drain
\square\sigma - V’(\sigma) + \tfrac{1}{16\pi}F’(\sigma)R = -\Gamma, \quad \Gamma=\alpha\rho_m.

FRW bookkeeping drives σ toward a cliff. F → 0⁺. G_eff → ∞.
In a stage-universe: finite-time fracture.
In a well-universe: the clock betrays you.

⸻

4. The dilation that eats the deadline

Let τ be proper time of a comoving observer inside.
As r → 0, τ → ∞.

Drain equation in proper time:
\frac{d\sigma}{d\tau}=-\alpha\,\rho_m(\tau).

But ∫ρ_m dτ < ∞.
So σ asymptotes. It never crosses the cliff in any finite τ.

Result:
Finite-time catastrophes in coordinate time are converted to infinite proper-time approaches.
The substrate tires. The ledger runs. The modulus weakens.
But the snap is unreachable.

The rip dissolves into a fall that never ends.

⸻

5. The Great Attractor is not gossip

We mapped an unseen tug behind dust and called it messy structure.
In this frame it is signature.

Every stubborn peculiar velocity, every bulk flow that leans through the galactic center, every shear that survives better masks — together they form a compass.

It does not give you a postcard.
It gives you a direction.
Through us. Past the plane. Toward the singularity that owns the strain.

⸻

6. Why the tension never tears the world

Act II: tension grows, modulus softens, fracture imminent.
Act III: the well is deeper than the strain.

The singularity accepts every increment.
The horizon keeps causal books and never bounces a check.
Stretch spacetime all you like. The interior owns the load.

The metric does not snap.

⸻

7. Observable teeth
	1.	Flow alignment — peculiar velocities lean stubbornly toward the galactic center line, even after deprojection.
	2.	Shear asymmetry — lensing gradients across the Milky Way plane refuse to wash out under better masks.
	3.	Siren neutrality — gravitational-wave vs electromagnetic distances nearly identical; any large clean split demotes this Act.

No single mic drop. But together, a mood you can measure.

⸻

8. Ethics for a well

Fatalism is lazy. Doom is not denied, it is recast.
Entropy, decay, the poetry of loss — still here.

But the rip is unreachable.
The fall is endless.

That means you do not collapse alone.
You build and break together.
You love inside the descent.

Make it a good fall.

⸻

9. Antidotes to the usual scoffs
	•	“Goalpost shift.” No. Stadium shift. Inside horizons, time is radial.
	•	“Great Attractor is messy structure.” Then the anisotropy will vanish under better surveys. If it doesn’t, call it what it is.
	•	“This is metaphysics.” Yes. So were most first drafts of physics.

⸻

10. Coda

Act I: appetite unifies gravity, halos, acceleration.
Act II: appetite implies a fracture.
Act III: the fracture dissolves in dilation.

We are inside the well. We always were.
The singularity takes the tension.
The ledger never closes.

So that is the theory of everything.

The fall is endless.
The budget balances.
The punchline never arrives on your clock.

Nothing really matters —
which is precisely why everything you do does.

⸻



⚡ Patch Note I — The Standard Model Graft

⸻

1. Premise

Gravity was only the first appetite. The other “forces” are not forces at all — just different receipts the substrate prints when it pays coherence bills.

Electromagnetic, weak, strong:
Not separate commandments.
Three tollbooths on the same highway.

⸻

2. Action sketch

Promote σ into the gauge sector:

S = \int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\Big[\tfrac{1}{16\pi}F(\sigma)R - \tfrac12(\partial\sigma)^2 - V(\sigma) - \tfrac14 Z_i(\sigma)F_i^2 + |D_\mu H|^2 - U(H,\sigma) + \bar\psi i\!\not\!D\psi - y_f(\sigma)\bar\psi H\psi \Big].
	•	F(σ): sets G_eff.
	•	Z_i(σ): substrate permittivity for each gauge field.
	•	U(H,σ): Higgs portal, letting v drift slightly with depletion.
	•	y_f(σ): Yukawa whispers — light touch on masses.

All couplings wear σ like a ghost.

⸻

3. Interpretations
	•	Electromagnetic → substrate slip. Charge is how matter draws coherence that radiates long and cheap. Photons = ripples in σ’s elastic phase.
	•	Strong → substrate knot. Color flux binds itself; separating quarks is stretching a rubber sheet until it snaps and makes more quarks. Halos rhyme with flux tubes.
	•	Weak → substrate toll. Identity remapping is costly. W and Z are heavy σ-excitations — the toll to tunnel across flavor space.

⸻

4. Predictions
	•	α drift → sightlines through depleted halos show ppm-level wiggles in the fine-structure constant.

📐 Patch Note II — Space-Only Refactor

⸻

1. Trick

Set c=\hbar=1.
Time = length.
Mass = inverse length.

Now look at Newton’s constant:
[G] = L^2.
Gravity doesn’t set a force scale — it sets an area.

⸻

2. Consequence

Black hole entropy:

S = \tfrac{A}{4G}.

So capacity scales with area, not volume.
Information is capped by surface.

That is the finite-substrate axiom, derived.

⸻

3. Result

All physics can be written as powers of one dimension: length.
The only leftover scale is gravitational area.

Space-only ontology is not a whim.
It’s a patch that licenses the whole appetite story.

🩸 Gut Theorem I — The Snap

⸻

1. Statement

If σ drains monotonically and there exists σ_c such that F(σ_c) = 0, then the manifold fractures in finite time.

Proof sketch:
	•	Γ = α ρ_m > 0 → σ decreases.
	•	Matter domination: a ~ t^(2/3).
	•	Integration: σ(t) → σ_c in finite t.
	•	At σ_c, F→0, G_eff → ∞.

Bridge collapse. No warning. QED.

2. Narrative compression

Not a bang. Not a whimper.
A fatigue fracture.

The floor holds — until it doesn’t.

🕳️ Gut Theorem II — The Dilation

⸻

1. Statement

If the universe is interior to a black hole, then all finite-time substrate catastrophes dissolve into infinite proper time.

Proof sketch:
	•	Inside horizon: r is timelike. As r→0, τ→∞.
	•	Drain: dσ/dτ = -α ρ_m(τ).
	•	But ∫ρ_m dτ < ∞.
	•	So σ asymptotes. F never hits 0 in finite τ.

No rip. Only fall.

2. Narrative compression

The apocalypse is unreachable.
The singularity eats your deadline.

🔭 Side Note — Testable Teeth

⸻

	•	Lensing vs dynamics → bias tracks depletion history, not baryon fraction.
	•	Growth sag → fσ_8 dips late, cannot be neutrinos.
	•	Sirens → d_L^GW / d_L^EM drifts tiny, signed by β.
	•	Halo hysteresis → fossil shells lens then fade.

Prologue + Chapter 1 teaser of my noir/psychological-horror story — looking for feedback

⸻

Body:

Hi everyone, I’m working on a crime/noir story with psychological-horror elements.

The main character, Ed, is a detective whose narration may not be entirely trustworthy. I’d love feedback on the opening excerpt below.

Specific questions I’m looking for:
	1.	Did the prologue hook you, or was it confusing/overwritten?
	2.	Does Ed feel trustworthy, or is there something “off” about him?
	3.	How’s the pacing — too slow, too fast, or just right?
	4.	Which character moment (Ed, Beth, or Richard) stood out most?
	5.	Would you keep reading? Why or why not?

⸻

Excerpt:

What is this shadow?
This darkness clings to me, following with a hunger I can’t shake.

What is this fear? The sweat sticks to my skin, and every breeze becomes a thousand needles driving into my soul. My hands shake. Every breath is a fight.

I look down into the grave — most of the day’s work sitting six feet deep. The body inside is wrapped tight, layered in thick black plastic.

“She was amazing,” I whisper. “Too amazing. That’s why it had to end this way.”

I shovel dirt onto the bundle, each thud muffled, final. The shadows will be back.

⸻

Chapter 1 snippet:

“This coffee tastes like shit!”

“Come on, Ed, it’s too early for that language,” Beth says.

I glance at my partner of seven years and grunt. “You can’t tell me you disagree.”

She shoots me a glare worthy of Medusa herself.

“Regardless of what you think, this is a business establishment. Buy the coffee, keep the opinions to yourself.” She turns to the barista, smiles brightly, then storms out.

I start the car. Beth chucks her coffee out the window.

“This is the fourth one in three months,” she says quietly.

“Yeah,” I reply. “Some people can’t help themselves.”

What really ruins me, in the best way, is when a girl knows I’m obsessed with her. She knows I’d drop everything just to be near her. And she keeps me right where she wants me that is, under her.

She knows exactly what she’s doing. The way she laughs, the way she leans in close, the way her shirt rides up just enough to flash skin , every move is deliberate. Every moment is a tease.

Warning: Essay incoming!

 

I recently made a post about what I had learnt from being a first-home buyer at 25. Which a lot of people didn’t seem to care about. They wanted to know how I saved the deposit.

So here is how I did it:

**Save while you can.**

When you first start working at 18, this is generally the time in your life when you are least likely to need cash. Speaking generally, you don’t have a mortgage, you don’t have kids, you don’t have a lot of responsibilities or fixed expenses. Set your KiwiSaver deductions to 10% and learn to live with it. I can almost promise you won’t miss the extra money week to week but it will build up overtime to some significant funds. At 25 when I bought my first house this had 42k saved up in my KiwiSaver alone.

 

**Live minimally and learn to love it.** 

Firstly, I would like to address ‘singles tax’, part of the reason I could save as much as I have is I have been in a relationship for the last 6 years, we have shared a room, shared a car, shared expenses. Without this, saving this much would have been harder!

For several years I lived in cheap 5-bedroom, 6 people flats, sharing a room with my partner, making rent pretty affordable at $170 per person per week. Sharing power/water/Wi-Fi bills between 6 people made weekly living cheap. We shared meals, each cooking dinner once a week. Therefore, only having to buy enough groceries for one meal each, each week (plus then takeout or cook yourself a meal on the final day). Cooking bulk like this was so economical! If you missed dinner, you had lunch sorted the next day.

Lunch for me was typically leftovers, 2 minute noodles with so frozen peas, or something on toast; banana, tomato or when avo is in season avo on toast is less than a dollar a day for lunch!

Enjoy the free things in life, a walk through native bush, TVNZ On Demand, laying in the sun reading a library book at your local park, swimming at the beach….

 

**Money does buy happiness.**

Only spend money on things YOU value. Try not let societal pressure get to you. I mean this primarily in two ways. Firstly, the whole 'keeping up with the Kardashins'. New car, new phone new clothes. Do you need it, will it bring you joy, or could that money be better spent elsewhere?

Secondly in the more subtle sense. Hanging out with friends can be expensive. A trip to the movies, by the time you go for dinner with a drink, buy the ticket, plus some popcorn and an ice cream, easily $100 (if not more!) washed away!

Now think.

Where was the value in this for you.

Was that shitty bucket of popcorn worth $13, you could have watched the movie without it. Did you really need that cocktail at dinner, or could have you still socialised with your friends while drinking a glass of water. Maybe you save all your friends some money by suggesting the movies on a Tuesday so it's half price. that way you can all hang out twice as often! and now your date night with your friends is less than $50, and really, the value you get, the experience, is about the same.

PS, if you are someone who likes to go out for dinner often use First table or The entertainment book so that every time you go out dinner can be 25% off or half price!

 

**Delayed gratification for the win.**

I am not wealthy, but it is rare that I feel like I go without. Treats remain treats, when the become a habit, you stop appreciating them and can rinse money without thinking. If you buy a coffee every day, the amount you appreciate it will likely decrease every day, but it remains the same price. Does that make sense? So, with getting a coffee once every week or two it feels like a treat, therefore getting the best bang for buck $ to happiness.

**Transport:**

I live in Wellington City, practically everything is in walking distance if you are game enough. This is double bang for your buck. No transport costs for buses or petrol or parking AND no need to the gym as you get good exercise just walk an hour or two, even three! every day.

 

**Bank buckets and automation.**

As you can probably tell I have a very organised personality, I like to be in control, know where my money is going, and plan for the future.

I have five bank accounts. Automatically, on my weekly pay day all my money moves itself magically to where it should be.

Rent off to my landlords, estimated weekly utilities off to my bills account, a weekly grocery budget to my grocery account, my fun/spending money for clothes and entertainment to my fun account, and another chunk to my holiday savings account for when I want to travel. And lastly, some straight into my saving account.

The $ amount set for these is obviously very personal and has changed over the years as my salary increases and my preferences change, but the rule still stands.

It means I know exactly how much I am spending in each area of my life, which correlates to how much value I feel I get from that.

It ensures I am saving every week.

It ensures I can pay my bills every month,

and it lets me enjoy my fun money without having to stress about having enough to pay rent!

 

My real spending and savings for the last 4 and a bit years, living in Wellington:

Oct 2020-2021: Cash in Hand 31k - expenses 16k - saving 15k

Oct 2021-2022: Cash in Hand 33k - expenses 17k - saving 16k

Oct 2022-2023: Cash in Hand 40k - expenses 26k - saving 14k

Oct 2023-2024: Cash in Hand 54k - expenses 27k - saving 27k

Oct 2024-April 2025: Cash in Hand 24k - expenses 13k - saving 11k

 

TLDR: **Start saving early and consistently.** **Live minimally.** **Focus spending on what you value.** **Delayed gratification.**  **Automate.**",14,1756094659.0,PersonalFinanceNZ,2,1.0,False

Creating a Balanced 1400 Calorie Meal Plan for Weight Loss
----------------------------------------------------------

Creating a balanced 1400 calorie meal plan can be a fantastic way to support your weight loss journey. With the right approach, you can enjoy a variety of foods that not only help you lose weight but also keep you energized and satisfied. It's important to focus on nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins and minerals while keeping calorie content low. Below are some strategies and examples for effectively using a 1400 calorie meal plan.

### Understanding Nutritional Balance

A balanced meal plan typically includes proteins, healthy fats, and carbohydrates. Each macronutrient plays a vital role in your overall health:

- **Proteins:** Crucial for muscle growth and repair. Include sources like chicken, fish, beans, and low-fat dairy.
- **Healthy Fats:** Important for hormone regulation and satiety. Opt for avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.
- **Carbohydrates:** Your body’s main energy source. Choose whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for fiber and nutrients!

### Sample Meal Plan Breakdown

Here’s a simple example of how you can structure a 1400 calorie meal plan throughout the day.

#### Breakfast (Approx. 350 calories)

- 1 serving of oatmeal (150 calories) topped with a handful of berries (50 calories).
- 1 boiled egg (70 calories) for added protein.
- 1 cup of black coffee or tea (0 calories).
- 1 tablespoon of peanut butter (80 calories) stirred into oatmeal for healthy fat.

#### Lunch (Approx. 400 calories)

- Grilled chicken salad with mixed greens, cucumber, and tomatoes (300 calories).
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil and vinegar dressing (100 calories).

#### Snack (Approx. 150 calories)

- A small apple (80 calories) or a handful of baby carrots with 2 tablespoons of hummus (70 calories).

#### Dinner (Approx. 500 calories)

- 4 ounces of baked salmon (250 calories).
- 1 cup of steamed broccoli (55 calories).
- ½ cup of quinoa or brown rice (110 calories).
- 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or olive oil for flavor (75 calories).

### Shopping Tips for a 1400 Calorie Meal Plan

When planning your meals, shopping smart can make a big difference in your success:

- Focus on whole foods: Fresh vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains should make up the bulk of your diet.
- Read labels carefully: Pay attention to portion sizes and added sugars.
- Meal prep: Prepare meals in advance to prevent last-minute unhealthy food choices.

### Staying Hydrated

Don’t forget about hydration! Water is essential for weight loss, digestion, and overall health. Aim for at least eight glasses a day. You can also include herbal teas or infused water to keep things interesting without adding calories.

### Tracking Your Progress

Monitoring your caloric intake and weight loss can help you stay on track with your 1400 calorie meal plan. Use mobile apps or a simple journal to log meals, snacks, and workouts. This will help you identify patterns, make adjustments, and stay motivated.

Remember, while a 1400 calorie meal plan is a helpful guideline, it’s crucial to listen to your body. If you feel overly hungry or fatigued, you may need to adjust your calorie intake or make changes to the meal plan. Consulting with a healthcare provider or nutritionist can also provide personalized recommendations based on your individual needs.

By focusing on balanced meals and smart food choices, a 1400 calorie meal plan can be both effective and enjoyable. With each meal, you can work towards your weight loss goals while still savoring delicious foods!

Tips for Sticking to a 1400 Calorie Diet while Enjoying Meals
-------------------------------------------------------------

Sticking to a 1400 calorie diet can seem challenging, but with the right strategies, you can enjoy your meals without feeling deprived. Here are some practical tips to help you stay on track while savoring your food.

### 1. Plan Your Meals Ahead

Planning is key to successful weight loss. Devote some time each week to create a meal plan that fits within your 1400 calorie budget. This keeps you organized and prevents impulse eating. Include a variety of foods to ensure you get all the nutrients you need.

### 2. Focus on Nutrient-Dense Foods

Choose foods that are low in calories but high in nutrients. This allows you to eat a larger volume of food that fills you up. Good options include:

- Fruits and vegetables
- Whole grains
- Lean proteins (chicken, fish, beans)
- Healthy fats (avocados, nuts)

Nutrient-dense foods provide more energy and satisfaction, making it easier to stick to your calorie target.

### 3. Enjoy Cooking at Home

Cooking at home not only saves you money but also gives you control over ingredients and portions. Experiment with new recipes to keep your meals interesting. Use herbs and spices to add flavor without adding calories. Try grilling, steaming, or baking instead of frying to make healthier versions of your favorite dishes.

### 4. Practice Portion Control

Portion control is essential when you're on a 1400 calorie diet. Familiarize yourself with serving sizes to avoid overindulging. Using smaller plates can help you visually feel satisfied with less food. Pay attention to packaging for serving size information, and consider using a food scale for more accuracy.

### 5. Stay Hydrated

Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst with hunger. Drinking enough water throughout the day can keep those confusing signals at bay. Aim for at least 8 cups of water daily. You can opt for herbal teas or infused water to add some flavor without adding calories.

### 6. Don’t Skip Meals

Skipping meals can lead to excessive hunger and cravings, making it harder to stick to your calorie limits. Eat three balanced meals and incorporate healthy snacks. For example, a mid-morning snack of fresh fruit or a handful of nuts can prevent overeating later in the day.

### 7. Be Mindful While Eating

Practicing mindful eating can help you enjoy your meals more and prevent overeating. Take your time to chew your food and savor each bite. Put down your utensils between bites and eliminate distractions such as television or smartphones while you eat. This allows you to tune into your body’s hunger cues.

### 8. Indulge Wisely

You don’t have to eliminate all your favorite foods. Allow yourself the occasional treat! Mindful indulgence can help keep cravings in check. When you crave something sweet, try to balance it out. If you have dessert, reduce calories at earlier meals that day so it fits into your allowance.

### 9. Keep Healthy Snacks on Hand

Having healthy snacks available can help curb hunger between meals and keep you from reaching for unhealthy options. Some great snack ideas include:

- Carrot sticks with hummus
- Greek yogurt with berries
- Apple slices with almond butter

These snacks are satisfying and nutritious, making it easier to stick to your 1400 calorie diet.

### 10. Track Your Progress

Keep a food diary or use an app to track your meals. Monitoring what you eat can help you stay accountable and allow you to see patterns that may need adjusting. Celebrate small victories along the way to stay motivated, and don’t be discouraged by occasional setbacks.

By following these tips, you can enjoy your meals while effectively sticking to a 1400 calorie diet. Focus on planning, nutrient-dense foods, and mindful eating to make your weight loss journey enjoyable and sustainable. Remember, it’s not just about the numbers; it’s about creating a balanced lifestyle that you can maintain long-term.

### Conclusion

A well-structured 1400 calorie meal plan can be a powerful tool in your weight loss journey. By focusing on balanced meals that include lean proteins, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables, you create a satisfying diet that fuels your body while promoting fat loss. Remember, the key lies in variety and balance. different food groups ensures you don’t miss out on essential nutrients, which is vital for your overall health.

To stick to your 1400 calorie diet without feeling deprived, get creative with your meal preparation. Explore spices, herbs, and cooking methods that enhance flavor without unnecessary calories. Enjoy the meals you prepare by indulging in the process of cooking and experimenting with new recipes. It's also helpful to plan your meals ahead of time. This will not only save you from impulsive eating but will also allow you to make healthier choices.

Additionally, ensure you keep track of your food intake. Using a diary or an app can be a game-changer, helping you stay mindful of what you're eating and keeping you accountable. And don't forget the importance of staying hydrated. Often, we mistake thirst for hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking.

With commitment and a bit of creativity, adhering to a 1400 calorie meal plan can become an enjoyable part of your lifestyle. As you monitor your progress, celebrate your small wins along the way. This positive reinforcement will motivate you to remain focused and dedicated to your weight loss goals.

If not would you back sweeten now with lactose on transfer to the keg or wait until it’s had its 3 months, taste again and then back sweeten in the keg?  I can do this without risk of oxygen exposure.

Any other recommendations?

The 2025 Bahrain Business Environment: Statistically Stronger Than Ever\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting: Bahrain Bay skyline, gulf business environment. recently reported that Bahrain’s GDP is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2025, driven by fintech, logistics, and manufacturing.\
\
Foreign investment hit a record BHD 1.2 billion (USD 3.18 billion) in Q1 2025, according to Reuters.\
Over 2,100 new commercial registrations were filed from January to May 2025.\
The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) projects 4,000+ new jobs in the SME sector by Q4.\
\
\
Importantly, government-backed platforms like Sijilat and Tamkeen have shaved average company formation turnaround down to just 5-8 business days.\
\
Business is thriving, and global players are taking note. But, with growth comes tighter regulation—especially around disclosure and transparency.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Structure, Ownership & Governance\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration: team working in modern office. in the Seef District, not realizing full 100% foreign ownership was possible in my sector (check allowed activities here). That oversight cost me weeks in amendments.\
Here are the most relevant business types in Bahrain:\
\
With Limited Liability Company (W.L.L.)\
Single Person Company (S.P.C.)\
Bahrain Shareholding Company (B.S.C.)\
Foreign Company Branch\
Free Zone Entities\
\
See a breakdown of all Bahrain business structures.\
\
Bahrain now allows up to 99% foreign ownership in most sectors, outpacing both the UAE and Saudi Arabia in direct access for international entrepreneurs.\
\
What Does This Mean for Your Disclosure Requirements?\
The stricter your structure, the higher your disclosure obligations. Public companies (B.S.C.) face the toughest standards. All entities, however, must meet baseline disclosure regulations from the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT), EDB, and, for listed firms, the Bahrain Bourse.\
\
Core Disclosure Requirements for Bahraini Companies in 2025\
\
Shareholder & Director Disclosure\
All company registrations must list full names, nationalities, ID numbers, and ownership percentages of every shareholder and director.\
\
Updated annually and upon any change (e.g., resignation, new partners).\
\
\
Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO)\
\
Since the 2023 Anti-Money Laundering (AML) reforms, all entities must submit and regularly update a UBO register to MOICT.\
\
Penalties for non-disclosure now reach BHD 10,000+ and possible license suspension.\
\
\
Annual Financial Statements\
\
Mandatory for all companies, regardless of size.\
Companies exceeding BHD 100,000 turnover/year must have audited financials by a Bahrain-based licensed auditor.\
SMEs may self-certify but still must submit simplified reports.\
\
\
(If you need expert help, turnkey accounting services save massive time—and prevent regulatory headaches during Sijilat inspections.)\
\
\
Corporation Tax and VAT Returns\
Bahrain still has 0% corporate tax for most sectors, but VAT returns (10% rate as of mid-2025) must be filed quarterly.\
\
False or missing disclosures risk heavy fines and business closure.\
\
\
Public Disclosure (B.S.C., Listed Companies)\
\
Extensive requirements, including quarterly earnings, governance changes, and material events.\
\
Disclosures must be promptly published via Bahrain Bourse.\
\
\
AML & KYC Checks\
\
\
Companies in financial services, brokerage, crypto, and similar sectors face enhanced real-time reporting under new LMRA and CBB rules launched March 2025.\
\
\
Commercial Register (CR) Publication\
\
Every company must keep its CR data current in the Sijilat Commercial Register, now fully online.\
\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: paperwork in progress.. Here’s what I recommend:\
\
Select Your Entity Type and Ownership Model\
Use the MOICT Sijilat portal before preparing documents.\
\
Confirm if you qualify for 100% foreign ownership in your sector.\
\
\
Reserve Your Company Name\
\
Strongly suggest applying online Sunday mornings—approval queues are shortest then.\
\
Avoid names with “International,” “Bank,” or “Royal” to skip added scrutiny.\
\
\
Prepare All Required Documents\
\
Passport copies, local address lease, bank reference letters, UBO declaration, business plan.\
Get digital and color scans—Sijilat rejects grayscale or low-res files.\
Documents often needed in both Arabic and English.\
\
Use a trusted public notary near the Seef Sijilat office—ask staff for “Mr. Hassan,” who is fast and discreet (I’ve used him twice).\
\
\
Submit Online via Sijilat\
\
Upload all documents, pay BHD 50 application fee.\
\
Pro tip: Morning uploads process faster; avoid first days after major holidays.\
\
\
Register with LMRA for Labor Approvals\
\
\
Even if you have no staff yet. This smooths future visa processing.\
\
\
Open Bank Account (Post-Approval)\
\
Local banks prefer applicants with MOICT pre-approval.\
\
Emirates NBD (Diplomatic Area) has dedicated expat business desks.\
\
\
Apply for Commercial Registration & Municipality License\
\
Ensure office lease is fully compliant (check cost breakdowns here).\
Municipality inspections sometimes require presence—bring snacks, as wait times can be long.\
\
See the full company formation process.\
\
Cost Considerations: Real BHD Figures & Smart Budgeting\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs: business finance with calculator, money, planning.: BHD 440–800 all-in, including Sijilat, MOICT, and municipality fees.\
- Branch or B.S.C. setups: BHD 1,200–2,400 (requires legal advisor).\
- Annual audit/accounting (BHD 100,000+ turnover): BHD 650–1,500 for licensed auditor.\
- Virtual office/registered address: BHD 250–600/year (prime locations in Seef or Bahrain Bay are more).\
- Document legalizations, translations, and notarizations: BHD 50–180 / document.\
Find a detailed company formation cost breakdown here.\
Tips to save money:\
- Prepare full UBO and director lists before applying—repeat trips to the notary are costly.\
- Batch all legalizations and translations on the same day (bulk discounts apply).\
- Choose shared office space in Seef—prime access with lower costs and easier municipality inspections.\
- If you’re using a local sponsor for restricted activities, ensure annual agreement review to avoid hidden escalation fees (see sponsorship guidance).\
\
Compliance & Ongoing Post-Formation Disclosure\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: legal documents and compliance audit.\
Watch out for these red flags:\
- Incomplete BO data = investigation by MOICT.\
- Unreported director changes = CR suspension.\
- Missed audit deadlines = fine, and possible public “naming and shaming” on the MOICT portal.\
(I’ve seen companies scramble when a director left the country—always have a backup local Power of Attorney ready.)\
\
Business Culture: Navigating Disclosure with Local Customs\
Bahraini business is built on trust, but don’t conflate that with informality. Disclosure is a formal ritual, yet meetings still happen over traditional dates and coffee (served by an impeccably polite office attendant who always, always brings a second pour). Scheduling around Ramadan is key—government offices work shorter hours, so file in the mornings.\
Networking matters. Even regulatory staff will remember your face (and your punctuality). If you’re ever stuck with a document issue, occasionally a quiet conversation in a Majlis-style waiting room can yield a friendly tip or shortcut you’d never find online.\
Surprisingly, Bahrain’s regulatory culture is more supportive and less adversarial than the UAE or Saudi Arabia. Officials generally want to help you get it right, not trip you up. But, you must be proactive—show up early, be fully prepared, and always bring hard copies.\
\
Bahrain Free Zones & Special Structures\
Free zones like the Bahrain International Investment Park offer unique disclosure and tax advantages—especially for manufacturing, logistics, and fintech.\
\
Simpler reporting\
Up to 100% foreign ownership\
0% import/export duties\
\
See Bahrain’s full range of free zones and their benefits.\
Small tangent: A friend set up in the BIIP to import smart water meters. He chose the free zone for speed and cost, but later realized he still needed annual UBO filings like any onshore company. The lesson? Free zone doesn’t mean free from disclosure obligations—just sometimes less paperwork.\
\
My Top Resource Recommendation\
If you’re new to Bahrain, use a Sijilat-registered formation agent. KeyLink in Seef is my go-to (here's why):\
- Knowledgeable about latest 2025 disclosure law updates\
- Solid English/Arabic translation team\
- Well-connected in both government and banking circles\
- Transparent fees—no nonsense add-ons\
Also: always have your documents scanned in color, not black and white. Sijilat’s portal can be surprisingly picky about this small but important detail.\
\
Common Disclosure Pitfalls—And How to Dodge Them\
\
\
Missing deadlines for annual filings:\
Set recurring calendar reminders and triple-check deadlines on Sijilat.\
\
\
Incomplete BO info:\
Gather all passport/ID documents from international partners before formation—the MOICT has no patience for “pending” entries.\
\
\
Name selections that trigger MOICT review delays:\
Stick to simple, unique names; avoid any connotations of banking, finance, or royalty unless you have advance MOICT clearance.\
\
\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi Arabia: An Insider’s Comparison\
Unlike the UAE, where local “sponsors” are often mandatory and opaque, Bahrain allows transparent foreign ownership models, especially for SMEs. Regulatory offices are smaller and more accessible (Seef and Bahrain Bay are easier to navigate than Dubai’s JAFZA or Riyadh’s Business Gate). The disclosure process is less bureaucratic, provided you’re precise.\
\
Professional Support: When (and Why) You’ll Need It\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: business support and consultation. or your preferred Sijilat-approved agent can save you 10+ hours and prevent serious missteps.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Disclosure and Governance\
1. Do all Bahrain companies need to disclose shareholder details?\
Yes—every company, from solo S.P.C. entities to B.S.C public companies, must disclose full shareholder/director data upon formation and update Sijilat annually.\
2. Are there special disclosure rules for free zone companies?\
While free zones offer tax and import/export advantages, disclosure requirements for BO, financials, and governance are almost identical to mainland. Learn more about Bahrain free zones.\
3. What’s the penalty for late or false disclosure?\
Fines reach BHD 10,000+, CR freeze, public listing of your non-compliance, and—worst case—license suspension.\
4. Can I use an agent for annual filings?\
Absolutely. Specialist services (find options here) are now standard, and the time (and fine) savings are significant.\
5. How much will my annual compliance cost?\
Budget BHD 200–2,000 depending on company size, volume of transactions, and audit requirements. See detailed cost breakdowns.\
\
Last word:\
Bahrain rewards transparency, speed, and strong relationships. Master the disclosure game, and the doors of Bahrain’s thriving business districts—from Bahrain Bay to the Diplomatic Area—will open wide. And if you ever find yourself sipping coffee in an office off Government Avenue, remember: in Bahrain, sharing information is good business.\

**Episode Specific Disclaimer**: this one was particularly hard to do because its a long slog of an episode that is supposed to introduce us to each character, I know it's not as fun as some of the others have been but I promise things will pick up once we get past the getting to know you stage! this episode is longer than the usual episodes by over 20 minutes and because of that the rundown needs to be broken into two parts (something I didn't realize until after I spent hours typing and formatting it 😩😩😩) Part two will post tomorrow. But since I had to shorten each post that means you get more pictures! win win. (this part of the disclaimer is mostly for the benefit of u/No_Staff7110 who is the only person that has been waiting for this post 😂)

# Let's learn what this show is about!

[and we're off!](https://preview.redd.it/pew1nh9y93lf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf1e77e115e2d7e7d275b6f88736d93c7a43ad43)

We open to the screen literally telling us that we are in New York in the year 1882 >!so many posts are always like ""wait what year is it?!"" they literally tell us in the opening sequence! were you looking at your phone?!< a bunch of horse drawn carriages are pulling large crates through Central Park and in the distance above the trees you can see the top of a large ass structure that still has scaffolding around it. We cut to a house that does not have any scaffolding around it and a (very adorable) young man dressed in livery steps out to pick up the paper followed by an (also adorable in his own way) older man which I would guess is the butler. They are looking across the street and we cut back to see the building with the scaffolding and the carriages that were in the park have pulled up in front! The butler of the scaffolding house steps out with like 15 footmen in way fancier liveries than the kid across the street and the two butlers kind of bow to each other like they are about the throw down or enter a dual? But no the non scaffolding butler just goes back inside and the camera pans up to a disapproving Christine Baranski mean mugging the entire block.

[Establishing the tone of her character right out the gate.](https://preview.redd.it/9shscn8z82lf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c977a716ccf614e38cd2aaf60feaab6164496e8)

We go downstairs (?) in the same house and find out the most important information of this entire opening sequence...THEY HAVE A DOG!!! Who is eagerly following what we assume is his mistress to the window, she too wants to look at Scaffold Manor, but she seems less annoyed about it than the other lady.

The adorable young man in livery is sweeping the sidewalk in front of the non-scaffold place when the mail main comes up, and hands him an envelope that has a black band around the edges...that means someone is dead if you didn't know the old timey customs...adorable young man has some humor about him because he makes an offhand remark about the people he works for being basically old and walks into the house to deliver the mail to the butler. We stroll through the downstairs of this house and it seems cozy. Young man in livery strolls past a woman in a lady's maid uniform, who then passes a very young regular maid, and into the kitchen we find the cook who while talking to the butler start to drop some names to these characters finally. The butler strolls up the stairs and the opening credits reminds us this is a Julian Fellowes joint, so get ready for some cozy toff loving propaganda!

[eat the rich except for the ones penned by Lord Fellowes](https://i.redd.it/thmbvhbj72lf1.gif)

We are somewhere new, looks like an office but all we can see is a Lady in Black, so this might be who sent the dead notice to the non-scaffold house. The lawyer man is telling her that her father (the dead man, General Brook) left her nothing but $30, the railroad stocks he had owned were worthless >!yes that's right folks, WORTHLESS!! This will never be a thing! let it go!!!< and the house they lived in was a rental, she's gonna have to find somewhere to go double quick. Ms. Brook is shook, and she basically says ""my father is a liar? my father is *was* a liar."" so the lawyer man is like ""yeah so anyway you can't stay here because you are broke as a joke but you said you have aunts? because at this point it's them or the streets"" and the Lady in Black is contemplating how mean the streets can possibly be.

We follow the Lady in Black to her rental flat and she's silently reading a letter, we get a close up of some tickets that were in the letter then she looks up at the portraits what we assume are her dead parents before she decides to write another black banded letter. We cut to annoyed lady and less annoyed lady reading the letter, which is how we learn Ms. Brook is named Marian and these are her aunts and these two are definitely sisters...as the little sister in my personal relationship I can say this is a very accurate portrayal. We can already see that big sis harbors a lot of resentment towards little sis who didn't have to enter the chattel market and become some subsidiary of a worthless man Mrs. Worthless Worthlessington, which is probably why she is less annoyed about everything. Now we learn big sis is named Agnes and that General Brook was named Henry and (also very like my real life sibling relationship as we are also two girls and a boy) Agnes has a lot of words about her brother and a lot of them seem to imply that he was of the Worthlessington variety (I love my brother, and my father, and husband if it comes to that but I still think all men ain't shit, also being attracted to cis straight men is a curse.)

[\\""Dear Daddy, why'd you fuck over my life like this?\\""](https://preview.redd.it/mi2chuisa2lf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=587f19c1bf0f77cb2892ec7dd901c320c56f86d8)

Spinster sister (who's name hasn't dropped yet) seems to chat a lot...she goes on about the various methods of travel for the 12 hour journey, what kind of job their niece can get and Agnes thinks very high of herself so no one in the house is allowed a job but she also wants to drive it home that she resents the thought of having to support her niece because her brother was General Worthlessington. Then she complains that there is too much mail which is obviously a Fellowes plot point that will come back around shortly >!UNLIKE THE RAILROAD STOCKS!<. Spinster sister walks over to the window and Scaffold Manor is now without scaffolding! A carriage pulls up and Agnes starts shit talking the woman to whom the now Scaffold-Free Manor belongs as the carriage with this woman in it pulls up. She gets out and is called Mrs. Russell, we don't her face but her fit is very posh looking and the size of the house definitely tells us this woman is well kept (it's an age where women couldn't make this kind of money alone so there has to be a man involved at some stage) She turns to see the sisters watching her from their home and they seem very embarrassed to be caught out.

The Lady of the Manor is touring what looks like a very overextravagant home and she is throwing out Italian and French locations where a lot of the swag was plundered from with her tour guide to make sure we are not lost on exactly how grandiose this place really is. We also get to see a close up of her fancy fit and her face and well, we are seeing pretty privilege at work. We move on to a hand grabbing a cigar and then lighting it up so we get to now see the Lord of the Manor and her Ladyship is already scolding him about smoking, she's taken off her coat since we saw her last (5 seconds ago) and god damn that dress is amazing. I sometimes wish I could go back in time and live like these people and then I remember I am black and probably would have less fun than they are having. His Lordship drops his paper and you see his face and daaaaaaaaaamn, its that attracted cis straight men curse putting in some WORK again. They chat for a little bit about nothing of consequence except she got a new housekeeper and then we get to the point of the scene (outside of introducing us to his Lordship) these two hot people are hot for each other too. Her Ladyship rolls off a list of a half dozen famous American families that she called on to make friends with and then the biggest catch of them all The Mrs. Astor, his Lordship drops in her Ladyship's name and well its a good thing she's beautiful because Bertha is definitely not a beautiful name. From this scene we are to learn this Lady is a wannabe social climber, her man is rich as fuck and has no fucks to give about anything, and they have two kids.

[so fancy, so EUROPEAN!](https://i.redd.it/b8k6g68qb2lf1.gif)

Her Ladyship leaves the room and now its time for them to name drop a bunch of people so that we will know who everyone is, I won't bore you with that part because it will become relevant when we see those people. The butler, Church, heads downstairs and this is way less cozy than across the street, I counted at least 18 different people walking around in this scene, and this can't even be half the staff. The only thing of note is the chef doesn't like the kitchen in this fancy new house and the valet is named Watson (FELLOWES FACT: Watson was also the name of the valet that Bates replaced on series premiere of Downton Abbey!)

Back across the street, Spinster sister is talking to the cook who is making the bed? (so I guess she is Cook/Housekeeper) about the niece coming and Mrs. Bauer says ""oh it will be better than having to only look after you two old crones!""

[let's get GASLIT](https://i.redd.it/ll58kvqc53lf1.gif)

Its the next day and we are on a busy street maybe its wall street? and there is a carriage that pulls up carrying the hot rich Russell man, he strolls out looking hot and into a building with RUSSELL CONSOLIDATED TRUST boldly written twice on the facade >!which is hilarious to me that in season 3 the company is called Russell Industries...why the change? I get diversification and having multiple companies but Russell Industries is so generic that it could mean anything. Why not be more specific to railroads like they were to GR Steel?!< So hot man is shuffling papers and looking important when a minion with a smoooooooth low voice comes in, like a true bass, and we find out that the hot man is a robber baron who got into the club by the way of the railroads. This minion says ""yo boss, we need to break some necks of the city aldermen to get a railway station built"" and Mr. Robber Baron Russell is like ""hmm, let me think of a way to be nice about it first""

[a whole ass building rich](https://i.redd.it/ny5t0qu6o2lf1.gif)

We return to the Lady in Black, Marian, who is strolling through the hall of what must be her now empty rental flat, the lawyer is waiting for her out front with a little wagon carrying the sum total of her worldly possessions in a small trunk and he seems like a very dumb man because he just says ""girl, you look awful, have you ever heard of sleep"" and she says ""if this was the 21st century i would tell you to fuck off, but since its the 19th century I'll tell you that's not what you should ever say to any woman ever"" the pull away from the rental and honestly I'd be sad to leave it too, it looks lovely. They get to the train station and its an awkward goodbye because she shoos him away and says she can wait alone and then says ""you know where to find me!"" and he's like ""oh word, can I hit you up?!"" and she's like ""oh not like that"" and he's like ""oh I didn't mean it like that"" even though WE ALL KNOW he did mean it like that, reeks of desperation this one does, but she's naive enough to believe him and feel embarrassed at her assumption. He tips his hat and good riddance >!if only!<. She sits down on a bench and then oh shit a fight breaks out right in front of her... there is a scuffle, she knocks into the woman next to her on the bench and then steps on that woman's skirt and rips it and while that happened one of the ruffians absconds with Ms. Marian's purse. So I went back and watched this scene several times and you can actually see that the two ""fighters"" marking her as soon as the lawyer left, the purse thief is sitting on the next bench over to her and he was obviously in on the whole thing from the jump, so she probably shouldn't have shooed the lawyer away so fast. The train comes and she discovers the purse missing and goes up to the porter and is like ""help me! I am an innocent orphan Mary Sue and I need to get on this train!"" and he's like ""fuck all the way off if you are without a ticket girl, no one cares"" so then she goes back to the girl whose skirt she just ripped and is like ""have you seen my purse?! my life is over!!!"" and ripped skirt girl is like ""can't you like borrow money from a friend or something?"" and Marian is like ""I HAVE NO FRIENDS!!! I HAVE ONLY LIVED HERE MY ENTIRE LIFE BUT APPARENTLY MY DEAD FATHER WAS THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW IN THIS TOWN!"" and ripped skirt girl is like ""sucks to be you, i guess"" and Marian is like ""oh well I guess I should stop wasting your time so you can get on the train"" and ripped skirt girl is like ""did you miss the fact that I am Black? I can't board yet"" and Marian is like ""I have never been near a black person before so I have never seen the different rules in action, my bad"" and then she walks away and bursts into tears...making sure she is *just* loud enough that ripped skirt girl has to notice and feel sorry for her.

[Poor one out for this beautiful rental home.](https://preview.redd.it/ekag4gldt2lf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a8c2ea09ba11f25659aa00f1eb736ee179cc34a)

We are now on the train and it's in the Black car, although there are two white people in it one of them is Marian, looks like her pity play worked. She is trying to cover her face with a handkerchief because the guy in the seat in front of her is smoking. Ripped skirt girl is like ""sorry its not 1st but even if I had enough money i wouldn't drop that on you because I don't know you like that"" and Marian is like ""oh no its fine because I just needed you to feel sorry for me and it worked, my aunt will pay you back for this"" and RSG is like ""yeah, I know New York...you are going to the pretentious white side""

Back to Russell Manor and the Lady of the Manor is walking in arm with not her husband and then drops more fancy French locations that the swag of the Manor was plundered from and asks about his room so this must be the boy child. He's like ""yeah yeah this house is fancy but I got a train to catch because I am in my oat sewing years"" and she it like ""WHAT NOOO MY WITTLE BABY PLEASE STAY AND HANG OUT WITH ME"" and he's like ""sorry but Mrs. Fish told me to catch this train so I can hang out with all these society people"" and you can see her nearly soil her undergarments at the thought of her son hanging out with THE Mamie Fish but she wants to play it cool, so she casually asks ""well who is going to be there?"" and he prattles off more famous American family names and ends his list with ""Carrie Astor"" to which she actually does soil her undergarments and says ""CARRIE ASTOR?!??!! PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE HITTING THAT SO I CAN FIND MY IN TO SOCIETY!!!"" and he's like ""calm down, I don't know her"" and she says ""GET YOUR ASS ON THAT TRAIN AND DON'T COME BACK UNLESS YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH CARRIE ASTOR AND ONLY CARRIE ASTOR"" and then he's like ""fine but where is my sissy, I want to see her first"" and she's like ""nope, your sister is being infantilized at present and cannot be disturbed, catch that fucking train, you can see her when you get back but only if you can confirm your friendship with Carrie Astor""

Back to the ladies thrust into an interracial friendship, they step on to the dock to catch the ferry and they see the ferry coming in with poor CGI rendering of a storm brewing over the big city, they both say a wistful goodbye to each other and Marian tells Ripped Skirt Girl to ask for her when she comes to collect her repayment in a few days but Marian not once in this whole interaction asks Ripped Skirt Girl who kindly lent her money for a train and a ferry, what her name was.

[Not the worst CGI on this show but not there have been some real atrocities.](https://preview.redd.it/mzehpu75g2lf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b372b95f0b4ba012e3b7c3cae719bab68565b3c5)

Back to Russell Manor and that bad CGI rendering of a storm is no longer brewing, it pouring rain on top of this new build...a chance for them to see if the roofers did a good job I guess. We open with a new person, who must be the girl child (she definitely looks too old to be sent to the the park with a governess like her brother said) she says ""Tell me about your job Daddy! I am so desperate to be an adult so lets have grown up conversations!"" and her mother says ""ugh but can we not have boring ones?!"" and girl child says ""but like everything in this room comes from his job sooooo"" and before her mother has a chance to rebut we get a bout of thunder and lightning which allows the Lord of the Manor to turn the conversation to absent boy child ""I hope this rain hasn't reached up to Rhode Island because my son has a lot of banging and conquests to do before he comes back and is forced to work at my company in...how many days?"" ""three days"" her Ladyship replies, and then he's like ""now that we got our new digs, we should have a visit from your sister"" and she starts making gagging noises, so then he tries ""what about your friends?"" and she's like ""fuck those people, I am trying to reinvent myself in to the baddest bitch in New York and none of those people can measure up!!"" and then her daughter looks at her like she's lost her mind.

Back to the Lady in Black and she's off the ferry and getting into a very fancy looking carriage she looks out the window and sees Ripped Skirt Girl sitting under an awning to get out of the rain with a very worried look on her face, so she jumps out of the carriage and is like ""you're coming home with me!"" the carriage driver has a momentary look of racism in his eye but he remembers he needs to take the white girl home or he wont get paid so since she's insisting she won't leave without Ripped Skirt Girl, he relents. They arrive at the house and everyone downstairs really seems excited for a new miss in the house >!Armstrong is uncharacteristically pleasant in this scene? she seems excited and even smiles?!?!!<, Bannister and John pop up from their dinner to let her in and are both wide eyed to see Ripped Skirt Girl step out of the carriage too. Bannister, proving to be one of the only smart people we've met so far asks what her name is and once again Ms. Brook is shook because she realizes she took this woman's money and kindness and never even thought to ask her name. Ripped Skirt Girl announces her name is Ms. Peggy Scott...is your name actually Margaret or did your parent's actually give you a nickname as a birth name?! I need to know. Anyway, Marian says she's going to go ask the aunts she's literally never met for a favor right off the cuff, Bannister says they're in the drawing room and he finally drops the last veil of this household and tells us that Agnes' sister is named Ada (we are 25 minutes in and we've seen her 4 times already without knowing her name!) Then Marian asks Bannister if he can hide Ms. Scott downstairs while she does this, so Bannister takes Marian upstairs and John takes Peggy downstairs.

[is this joy?](https://i.redd.it/ic33xcsz03lf1.gif)

We cut to Agnes finding Marian's story hard to believe and Ada is like ""oh goodie we can let her stay here!! oh wait I need to ask permission because of the uneven power dynamic between us...can we big sis?"" and Agnes is like ""um she could be smelly or ugly or poor?! we need to meet her first"" so Bannister leaves to get Ms. Scott for her interrogation. So Pretty Peggy comes in the room and Agnes sees she's not ugly, poor, or smelly so she's about to let her stay but Marian starts spewing reasons why she should be allowed to stay anyway almost as if she has verbal diarrhea. Agnes says Ms. Scott can stay but she needs to write her parent's address down so we can fill a plothole opened earlier, and after some apprehension she does this, then Agnes is like ""WHAAAAAAAAA? HOW DO YOU HAVE THE MOST GLORIOUS PENMANSHIP OF ALL TIME?! WHERE DID YOU LEARN THIS SOCERERY?!"" and Peggy's like ""I went to the School of Literal Black Excellence in Philly!"" and now both sisters are fangirling because they LOVE Black Excellence! Their daddy used his richness to help open it before Peggy was even born. So they send Pretty Peggy to get settled in a room and then Agnes instantly starts ripping into her niece about what her plans in New York are now that she has learned that her father was of the Worthlessington variety and then Marian snaps with a ""DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT MY DADDY!"" which makes Bannister look up and think *this bitch feisty*, Marian then says she doesn't want to be a member of the idle rich since she's not rich anyway because she knows in her heart that her daddy really was a Worthlessington, she just enjoys being difficult, so she's gonna get a job and Agnes is like ""ok but the only jobs you can do are the ones they don't pay you for, and we need to get you some fun clothes you look sad in that black thing you're wearing"" and Marian is like ""my dad just like died? I am supposed to be in the sad getup?"" and Agnes is like ""no one knows your father and the people here who do are glad he's dead so, mourning period over, BRIGHT FUN FASHION!"" and Marian wants to talk back because we are establishing she's difficult but Ada cuts in with ""Let's find you some friends!"" and Marian is like ""yeah I don't know anyone here or in Pennsylvania for that matter, because I had no friends and needed to bum a ride to the train station from the lawyer who I couldn't even pay money to because my father was so worthless..."" Agnes chimes in with ""By the way the friends you make must be idly rich, they can't have made their own money and must be living off the fortune created by their great grandparent or even higher on the family tree! And also their family must have been in New York as long as their wealth has been established!"" and Marian is like ""um, I have no money and you know my father wasn't from New York and had no money either?"" and Agnes is like ""yeah but his mother was my mother too and she was from a family that has been here longer than New York was a state! You pass the 3 generation test.""

[Ada really wanted her to sing](https://preview.redd.it/3klpn7tug2lf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ff20fd916b0a2785c0c946700a439069c8a5ecc)

We go downstairs and Pretty Peggy is being stared at like she has 3 heads, Bannister once again proving he's the only character worth his weight in gold, asks for food to be brought for her and pulls out the chair like a gentleman so she can sit down. The kitchen maid comes over with Peggy's food and jumps in the conversation of Bannister explaining the sleeping arrangements, she opens her mouth and her red hair isn't just a signal that she's of Irish descent, she's actually Irish and is confused that the dark skinned lady is going to be sleeping on the same floor as her (girl, PLEASE. you know these white people don't hold you much higher than they do Black people, right?) and Bannister is basically like ""sit down and shut up, thank you so much!"" Then the cook/housekeeper asks if she drinks coffee like somehow Black people have never heard of coffee before and poor Peggy is starting to think she might be surrounded by idiots. Cut to the lady's maid following Bannister around and displaying more bigoted behavior and Bannister again shuts it down because he is ***not*** of the Worthlessington variety, then John pops in to prove he's not a Worthlessington either and the Irish bigot and the lady's maid bigot continue to bigot and while she's not in this part of the scene, the lady's maid confirms cook/housekeeper is not a bigot.

It's the next day and Pretty Peggy is collecting her reimbursement from Agnes and Agnes tells her that she's stuck there again because the ferry is still not running, then Peggy's like ""well I see you've got a lot of papers there and I have a lot of secretarial skills because that's what is needed to fill this plothole and I must now pay you back for the room and board!""

Across the street the Lady of the Manor is looking out the window and watches a carriage pulling up to deliver a note to the house, she turns to act cool like she's not excitedly anticipating what the letter might be and the easiest way for a smother mother to seem normal is to snap at their child, so she tells her daughter to move into better light before she goes blind doing needle point in the dark. The butler brings the note in and she opens it and are like ""FUCK YEAH!!! SOCIETY BITCHES WANT MY MONEY!!! THIS IS HOW I BECOME ONE OF THEM!!!"" and her hot husband is reading the paper looking hot and he's like ""are these women married to men that might be useful to me?"" and she's like ""yeah, but is that really important right now? I'm making this about me!"" and girl child is like ""ooh can I come with you to the boring charity thing so that I can just do SOMETHING?!"" and her father is like ""YES! ANYTHING FOR THE BABY!"" and her mother is like ""maybe, it would undermine my infantilizing plans, but I don't want to piss off your father so I'll consider it"" and he's like ""oh that's the same day I am going to make a grown man cry, it's gonna be fucking sweet"" and she's like ""that's my man!""

[her eyes seem to roll just fine.](https://i.redd.it/d2ob1sur13lf1.gif)

Across the street again and Peggy finishes her secretarial favor and Agnes is impressed when Marian bounds in with THE DOG!!! who is just too cute and needs to be in more scenes. Agnes is not a fan of the dog so now I am side eyeing her then she snaps at Marian for being unladylike roaming the streets of New York acting like she's a servant on an errand for her mistress. Peggy is like ""awkwarrrrrd, I am going to go"" and Agnes is like ""no wait, you're the only person in this room I actually want to talk to, can I hire you to listen to me spew my thoughts and you can write my words down all the time?"" and Peggy's like ""HELL YES! but I need to live in Manhattan to do this, so as long as the room and board is included in the job"" and Agnes is like ""ok but you have to talk to your parents about it so we can all find out why you're avoiding them"" Peggy leaves and Agnes tells Marian ""oh by the way you are finally getting that unpaid job you wanted! my other niece needs people to help training the parentless youth of New York to pour our tea and clean our boots"" and Ada is like ""yeah so that they don't have to turn tricks in a life of prostitution instead!""

[based on his face, the dog feels the same about you Agnes.](https://preview.redd.it/wzrrdza9h2lf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=01584e1c3516261eadbeb01a8122bbfceb2472f1)

Across the street the other way, we see the lady's maid in this house skulking outside of the Hottie of the Manor's offices and she looks like trouble. He comes out of his office and is like ""are you looking for my wife who you work for?"" and she goes all doe eyed is like ""no, i took the long way to the staircase for no reason whatsoever"" so he walks of looking all fine but he's got a look in his eyes that says ""this bitch is trouble"" which is what I just said because its obvious. Then Mr. Watson walks up and is like ""Bitch, stop everyone can see what you're doing its not going to work"" and she's like ""yeah whatever, I am a bad ass troublemaker and I answer to no one but me""

[so obvious the aliens can read you two galaxies over.](https://preview.redd.it/7eqn9tge63lf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=829597149a5449c58a549006cb85c97a293c4679)

Finally we leave 61st street and there is a skiff on the water and some men in suits fishing (blows my mind how people used to do all this shit with so much clothing on) then we see and a crazy fancy ass home on the cliff with a bunch of men in hats and women with parasols strolling around the lawn so we must be in Newport! Two women stroll out of the house and the older one starts shouting at Mr. Russell the younger, she's like ""Yo, do you know Carrie Astor"" and he's thinking like *oh good, now I can say I socialized with her so my mom will let me back in the house* so he says ""I've met her but I don't like know her"" and the woman says ""well, now you will, go play the white people games that I set up on this lawn and don't stop until your besties"" and she walks off, so Larry turns to Carrie and is like ""Mrs. Fish be crazy huh?"" and Carrie is like ""understatement. I don't really want to play but lets grab the tools and stand over there, as long as we hold them and chat she'll leave us alone"" so they chat and she uses it as a way to drop a comment that she finds him attractive but then in this sea of blue and white and flax colored outfits a man in a red suit and steampunk sunnies pushes in to the conversation. Carrie calls him Mr. Van Rhijn so now we are coming full circle. Larry mentions his parents live on East 61st and 5th and Mr. Steampunk says ""hey! that's where my mama lives!""

[As a mother I say yes, as a daughter I say...also yes, because I am old now and realize that most of the stuff I was stubborn about was wrong.](https://preview.redd.it/ue2bgk4sh2lf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3f36e0a2136decb35c1c6a937044a369817268c)

Another new location and there is a lot of cakes so I am now hungry, it appears to be some sort of tea room for Black excellence and we see Pretty Peggy sitting in a sea of mostly men but she is sitting across from one of the only other women in the room, this woman opens her mouth to ask ""why are you living with white people in Manhattan?!"" and Peggy says ""because I lent the youngest one money after she ripped my skirt and didn't even ask me what my name was"" then the woman says ""well I brought all your stuff"" so now we know this is her mama, and then follows up with ""so do you have a plan together of what you're going to do in the white people home?"" and Peggy says ""I am a writer with gumption and I will prove it one way or another!"" which explains why her secretarial skills are so refined and her mama is like ""your father thinks that's dumb and too ambitious"" and Peggy is like ""just one of the many reasons I am only talking to you"" and mama is like ""girl, you know he was just trying to protect you from being a dummy and ruining your life because he loves you"" and then Peggy has a look for a second that her mother might have a point but then she thinks harder and is like ""nope, it was selfish and I am mad mad mad, not coming back"" and they both look away wistfully and her mama is like ""well here is some money because I love you and no one ever has enough of that"" and I wish my mom still did that for me because I could use an extra $20 right now (to buy a cake with because the opening of this scene really did make me hungry)

I lived in the Kresge Apartments during the 2024-2025 school year and put together a bunch of tips about what apartment life is like! Although this is specifically directed toward people in the Kresge Apartments, there are probably a bunch of cool tips for other apartments on campus too. 

This is best viewed on the google doc I made it on since none of the pictures and formatting I put on there copied over to reddit (and reddit doesn't allow over 40k characters so I cut a LOT out to post what I could here), so I highly encourage you view it[ on the original version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z0-RI3i4wPA4OHposEEjHOahSdr0DlUbmvLbqcT9wcg/edit?usp=sharing)

NOTE - This is NOT intended for freshmen. All freshmen (and transfers) are housed in dorms, and I have made a separate guide for you party people[ here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit?usp=sharing). The guide you are currently on is specifically for sophomores and up who have on-campus housing in apartments.

* [This guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit?usp=sharing) is helpful to all students at UCSC even though it is directly aimed at the Kresge crowd. The name is sort of misleading, but I can't change it on reddit :( 

NOTE - This is not intended on a “how to get housing” guide for UCSC. There are plenty of other materials out there for that, and if you are really lost, I suggest you go to your housing office and really talk to the people over there. That’s what I did my freshman year, and I was a lot better off for it. 

That being said,[ here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z0-RI3i4wPA4OHposEEjHOahSdr0DlUbmvLbqcT9wcg/edit?usp=sharing) is the guide!

Kresge Apartments

Hey all! 

I lived in the Kresge Apartments during the 2024-2025 school year (and will again for 2025-2026 (dang im lucky lol)). All of this (unless expressed otherwise) is going to be as of 2025, so if something changes dramatically… darn.

If you are a Kresge-affiliate or you are an affiliate from another college, just keep reading! If you are a Kresge person and don’t want to read anything though, you can probably just get away with this apartment walkthrough and this photo album. 

NOTE - This is NOT intended for freshmen. All freshmen (and transfers) are housed in dorms, and I have made a separate guide for those here. The guide you are currently on is specifically for sophomores and up who have on-campus housing in Kresge apartments.

There are MAJOR differences, including bathrooms, kitchen, keys, etc. so make sure you are on the right guide.

This guide is helpful to all students at UCSC even though it is directly aimed at the Kresge crowd. The name is sort of misleading, but I can't change it on reddit :(

Intro:

Okay, new house new you! In these wonderful (old) (crusty) (built in 1973) (ashy) (dusty) apartments, you can have the time of your life! 

Location

We are located right across the street from the I lounge. 

Our relative position on campus

All in all, we are in a pretty decent spot. Getting to campus is not as accessible as the C9/10 apartments are, but nowhere near as hidden away as the RCC or Oakes apts, not to mention the Village. 

Travel Spots near us

Bcycles and the buses are going to be critical for you this year. Since we are in a bit of a weird spot, lower science hill and the center of campus is much more accessible to us. RCC is also more accessible, but upper science hill and 9/10 is now a bit of a trek, especially with the construction going on. 

The nearest bus stop that goes south is the Porter/RCC stops, and it’s about a 5-7 minute walk, so if you are typically unprepared (like me) you’ll probably huff it to make the off-campus metro on time. 

You will also probably be using the Porter bridge a lot to get to class since that is now your liaison to the rest of campus while on foot.

Both the Kresge and Porter apartments use the same Bcycle docks, so be prepared for some competition since they’re right outside of both of our doors. The next closest docks are the Porter dorms and the Kresge dorms.

Rooms:

All Kresge apartments are for 3 people. One single and one double (subject to change given UCSC’s need for housing). Given that there are 7 floors for student habitation (with the construction going on), that means that there are a total of 126 people living in both J and K buildings. Even with so many people, there’s no real need to become a socialite. I have friends from other apartment complexes on campus and they didn’t reach out to other people much either. 

I have no dimensions of anything (rooms, furniture, drawers, etc) but pictures of almost everything so that you can at least have a sense of what you’re getting into.

This is the general floor plan:

Bedrooms

Since last year, your furniture has changed. Different clothing storage systems, different desks, different model drawers (maybe). Same crappy chairs though. Given all of that, there are some notable differences in the rooms this year. I won’t outline every tiny detail (mostly because I didn’t take enough pictures D: ) but I’ll go over the generals.

I don’t have measurements for any of this, so I measured with my soul. (Not very accurate since it is based on proportions I remember, but it’s really just meant to be a visual) 

If you want the cutout, print this out: Kresge Apartment Bedroom Cutout.pdf

You can get a general sense of the bedrooms using the last half of this video

The colors used in the model are:

Furniture item

Beds

Dresser

Shelf

Desks

Drawer

Trash & Recycle

Room/Box

Papers to cover stuff up (I forgot white out was a thing so i did this)



Single

My roommate who had the single didn’t do much furniture rearranging, but here is a possible (not necessarily optimal) layout 

Other things:

The shelf could possibly be used as a doorstop so your roomies don’t barge into your room.

The bed is a bit off the ground compared to the double (and last year) so it does make for easier storage (even though there’s so much already) 

The only really notable difference from the single to the double is that the single does not get the extra overhead storage spot for you to use. 

I recommend only putting things up here that you can play tetris with (like boxes or suitcases). Don’t put stuff that can easily crumple or fall off (like bags or oddly shaped storage systems) because they WILL fall out in the middle of the night and scare the shit out of you… like i will in your dreams. >:)

Photos:

Double

Here was the original layout that I came into, and what I changed my part to (since I was bottom bunk):

It was much more comfortable after that, since I had more privacy and could use more of the empty space. 

Other things:

As opposed to the single, there are two overhead storage spots for you and your roomie to use. 

I recommend only putting things up here that you can play tetris with (like boxes or suitcases). Don’t put stuff that can easily crumple or fall off (like bags or oddly shaped storage systems) because they WILL fall out in the middle of the night and scare the shit out of you… like i will in your dreams. >:)

There is a bit of space under the bed to fit stuff in, but I recommend the overhead space in the bullet point above since there is so much vertical space. There is legitimately 4 or 5 feet of vertical space up there. (maybe a bit of hyperbole but you get the point)

Photos:

Things to Know about the Bedrooms

Command strips are very useful in the apartments, and there is much less risk of paint peeling off compared to the dorms. Similar to freshman year, I suggest that in bedrooms (and bathroom) you put up a bunch of command hooks to hold your stuff. Jackets, towels, belts, and keys are all things that I hung on the command hooks I put up.

I’ll talk about this later in the keys section too, but the bedroom keys that you can use to lock the doors with can only be used from the outside. There is a mechanism where if you try to lock the door and then shut it, it will unlock. 

I guess this is nice if you have the single and don’t trust your roomies, but you can’t lock it while you’re in the room which kinda sucks.

In addition to the outside windows, there are very weird windows leading from the bedrooms to the common room/kitchen. What?? Why?? Nobody knows! My buddies and I think that the Kresge J and K buildings were originally office buildings and that’s why those windows are there, but that’s just a hunch.

In the wise words of u/chorpinecherisher, “the window connectin the kitchen to the BEDROOM lmaoo?? Talk about dinner and a show”

Common area

Entryway

The entrance is pretty roomy. There is a big hardy office door which you use your key to enter. There is also a storage area/coat check spot that’s pretty big too (not entirely visible in picture). 

There are two lights, one for the entrance, and one for the coat check. You can see both light switches in the picture below. 

Behind that little wall jut out is an access for piping, so… Yeah. (See it in the first couple of seconds of this apartment walkthrough)

Suggestions:

There is more than enough space under the door for an entrance mat. I suggest getting one from Costco. 

You should consider getting a shoe rack. It greatly helps with keeping dust out, but even so you will still have to vacuum. 

I recommend both of these from ikea since they combo well together (\~$10 per set)

[https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/grejig-shoe-rack-gray-40329868/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/grejig-shoe-rack-gray-40329868/) 

[https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/baggmuck-shoe-tray-indoor-outdoor-gray-60329711/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/baggmuck-shoe-tray-indoor-outdoor-gray-60329711/) 

If you get a rolling chair for your bedroom, consider putting the wood chair back in this storage corner.



Cleaning the Common Room

Everybody hates cleaning, but the common room might just be the hardest to clean. No? Just me? (i hate vacuuming)

Here are some minor tips for cleaning the common room, but if you want more general stuff and a list for each room of what steps to take when cleaning, jump to here

Move all the furniture to one side of the room to sweep and mop that half of the room, then move all the furniture to the other side to sweep and mop that side. There is typically a lot of dust, especially if you leave your windows open.

Do this during the day since moving furniture is loud

To mop, I like filling up the bathtub with warm water and pouring a bit of all-purpose spray in there (NOT BLEACH!). Then I use that as my mop bucket. I never used the provided one because it’s most likely all going down the bathtub drain anyway. 

I suggest using couch covers (like large blankets or something) for the couches. That way there isn’t much clean up for dust or spills for the couch. You can just wash the blankets. 

I consider the entryway and storage spot behind the front door to be part of the common room. However, I only ever cleaned the entryway - never the storage spot. Mainly because there was a bunch of stuff there, but also because we never used that spot and could get away without cleaning it until we moved out. Talk with your roommates about where cleaning boundaries lie. 

Kitchen

You have your own kitchen this year! It’s more like an office kitchen though since it’s all in a line, but it serves its purpose! 

Appliances

UCSC gives out some appliances, which is very nice. Some (like a microwave), you will still have to bring for yourself.

Oven / Stove

You will have an electric stove and oven. 

The way that the oven works is that you turn the knob to the temperature you want and the “Oven Heating” light will turn on. When the “Oven Heating” light is on, this means that the oven is below the temperature that you specified. 

I do not suggest storing anything meltable/burnable in the oven.

There is storage space below the oven in the form of a drawer. Use it for pots and pans if you hate having them out. Don’t store anything meltable in here though.

There are two small elements and two large elements right over some chrome drip pans. You can remove the elements to clean the drip pans and under the drip pans. Just make sure to test them when you stick them back in. If they don’t work, let someone know in the apartment discord or CruzFix and they’ll help you out. Just remember that the elements are electric and should be dry when you put them back into place. 

I like to have a bit of tin foil below the drip pans to make for easy clean up because I spill a lot of sauce and crap down there but you don’t have to do that.

Fridge

You will have a BIG fridge now! Yayyy! You can fill it up with goodies!

The freezer is also nice

The ice cube machine in there does not work (that goes for any fridge on campus), so it is a good idea to bring some manual ice cube trays. 

Sink

This is absolutely an office kitchen sink. It is not that great. There’s only one basin and we count our lucky stars that it’s not a shallow basin… It’s a medium basin, so you might have some struggles leaving loads of dishes in there, but ehh.

Right above the kitchen sink is a perfect place for a microwave or a dish rack. 

There is no way to stop the kitchen sink from draining without the drainer strainer/stopper given by UCSC

Sometimes the sink got this weird gunk in it (mold? mysterious residue??) Absolutely keep an eye on it and get the bleach spray out if you need to. 

The kitchen sink is deep enough for the brita pitcher to sit in. With dishes though? Not so much. You might end up filling the brita with the bathroom tub faucet a lot if you and your roomies are lax about dishes. 

There is plenty of storage space under the sink. 

Trash Cans

UCSC gives you a couple of different cans for the apartment. I’m going to include them for all rooms here to make it as annoying as possible to reference the rest of the document. 

Trash cans

You will have one big trash can for the kitchen. This trash can will take tall size trash bags. 

For the bathroom, you will have one mini trash can. This can fit a plastic grocery bag. 

For the bedrooms, there is one trash can for each room. These can fit a plastic grocery bag.

Compost

You will get one compost container for the apartment. Compost pickup is Tuesday, so set it out Monday night. 

Ours got so moldy that we ended up just not using it anymore. If you use it, be diligent on those Tuesday pickups. 

Recycling

For the kitchen, you will have one recycling container, where medium trash bags will fit them. You shouldn’t really use trash bags for the recycling though - that’s just for scale

You will have one recycling for each room (my tip is to just make both cans in the double for trash so you can give each person their own personal trash) 

If you have the opportunity, grab a ton of plastic bags from a supermarket and use them as trash bags for the smaller cans in your apartment. They make for a super economical and easy way to use those bags. 

Food

Now that you have a kitchen, there’s going to be a couple of things that you are going to want to focus on… Number one, food. Number two, food. Number three, food. All of them are food. 

Chances are, if you are hella excited about having a kitchen, this section is for you. If you are an instant ramen and vibes person, you probably aren’t as excited about cooking or this section lol. Consider reading it anyway because it’s pretty good to know. 

I also go more in-depth about what food to consider stocking your pantry with in my apartment essentials checklist, so check it out!

Dining hall food

The dining hall is still a very good resource. Sometimes you don’t want to make food for the night. Other times you might just be busy. Also, something like the to-go boxes are very nice to take advantage of.

Banana bucks VS Slug Points

It is very important to know the difference between these three two. 

Banana Bucks

Slug Points

Optional for all students including freshmen

Required for all freshmen (and others that live in the dorms)

Can be purchased in increments of $500, $100, and $50.  You can purchase more at any time

Can be purchased in… a lot of ways Blue is the best because you can supplement with Banana Bucks Don’t get the “Unlimited meal plans”. Those don’t give you access to cafe’s

Carries over until the end of the academic year

Does not carry over each quarter



I think the only reason that UCSC makes students buy Slug Points is because some people can’t be trusted to get food for themselves lol. By how some of the people act on campus, I think this is a pretty plausible hypothesis. 

There are also Flexi Dollars, but those aren’t great. They give you less of a discount at dining halls and cafe’s, but they do give you the ability to use them at places that Banana bucks and Slug points cannot be used, like Ivetta. 

Chicken

Chicken is amazing. The halal chicken gets such a bad rap… and that’s why it’s amazing for what we’re about to do. 

I took so much chicken from the dining hall last year using this method. Given that everyone hates it because it is unseasoned, it is always there and thus always reliable to take back to your apartment and season up! Usually when I brought it back to the apartment, I used it to make this awesome chicken tomato sauce spread for toast. There’s a bunch of other stuff that you can do with the chicken though, so get creative! Chicken tomato sauce spread for toast… thing

Costco

Pretty much the only store that I went to when I needed stuff was Costco. It has everything in bulk and is pretty cheap (since you’re buying so much at a time). 

Most of the kitchen stuff that I recommend getting for your pantry can be gotten at a combination of Safeway and Costco. Driving from UCSC to Costco and back for a shopping trip takes about 2 hours if you are being speedy. Make sure you have enough time to get back if you are taking a ZipCar.

If you need a costco membership, consider getting someone to get you a costco gift card (one time entry) or get someone who has one to come with you. 

Consider texting in the discord that you need someone to come with you to costco. If you do though, consider paying for their share of the ZipCar though.

Redwood Market

Redwood market is an awesome little place that you can use to supplement your diet. Most of the time (especially on restock days) they have hardy foods like spaghetti and beans, and sometimes you can get things like vegetables there

Everything here is free, so there is no need to worry about payment with Banana bucks or anything. It will feel weird to be in there the first couple of times you go, but don’t worry. Also, please don’t take more than what you need or what you will use.

There are some food assistance programs that I won’t cover here, but you can take a quick peek at them in this video: Food Resources at UCSC

Cleaning the Kitchen

Everybody hates cleaning, but cleaning the kitchen isn’t all too bad. It really depends on how much you use it and where you draw the lines of “kitchen” versus where it becomes the common room. 

Here are some minor tips for cleaning the kitchen, but if you want more general stuff and a list for each room for what steps to take when cleaning, jump to here

The all-purpose cleaner is going to be your best friend here. Most of the time you can soak food stains in cleaner, wait 3-5 minutes and it’ll come off with a bit of elbow grease

Melamine foam is a great way to get rid of stains. Ever seen those expensive Mr Clean “magic sponges”? Yeah. Get a pack of 100 of those for $10 on amazon. I gave half a pack to each of my parents for Xmas and… ok maybe it wasn’t the best present but you get where I’m going with this. This is the first link I found on amazon, but you can get a better deal if you just look up “melamine foam”.

Read this before removing the elements on the stove to clean the drip pans

You should never have to clean the inside of the oven. Years of grime have built up in there from dozens of college kids’ poor decisions. One more set of three doesn’t matter.

If you put plastic or something crazy in there and it melts though, that's on you dude.

Bathroom

This is the most temperature stable part of the apartment. You might come in here in the first couple of weeks during the heatwave just to find refuge. That’s why you want to make this space as comfy as it can be! Here’s a couple of tips about how you can do that 

Shower

The shower is a nice thing to have. 

The shower head is pretty standard. It can switch between a forceful mode and a lighter mode. Neither hurts when you use it. 

The temp does not go too hot. I like hot showers, so it’s a bit disappointing, but at least it’s better than the dorms last year. 

Although the UCSC does provide you with a shower lining, I would rather burn it long before I use it to shower. Along with everything else in this apartment, you have no idea what it’s been through. Get a new shower curtain and lining and you will thank yourself.

If you plan to take baths here, make sure to do a quick once-over of the tub with a sponge/towel and some diluted bleach spray. I used that in place of a mop bucket and the stuff that went down that drain is nasty. I bet others have done worse in there, so just be careful.

Mold may end up growing on the grout / caulk. Just spritz it with a bit of bleach and (most of) it should go away. At least enough to ignore until you move out.

There is no electric fan in the bathroom to get rid of steam (and stink). In fact, you will probably receive an email from UCSC begging you to keep the bathroom door open when you’re not using it to prevent mold lol.

There was this weird problem with the water pressure in our shower last year where if we were taking a shower at around four to seven am, it would rumble really bad. It was probably because nobody else was using water at that time in the night. I never ended up calling a CruzFix ticket for it though since I could fix it by pushing the diverter down just a tad so that a little bit of the water came through the bath faucet and the rest came through the shower head.

Here’s a tiny pic of the faucet and on/cold/hot valve: 

(tiny things matter too)

Here’s a video of the shower head: [https://youtube.com/shorts/bCh\_qNKbDug?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/bCh_qNKbDug?feature=share) 

Towels

You are going to need a spot to store your towels, and since UCSC gives you one (1) spot to store ANY towels in the bathroom, you should consider bringing some extra options.

I got some random over-door bath towel hook thing similar to this at a home goods store near me. It worked well for bath towels

Use a command hook for a washcloth so you can dry your hands after using the sink. 

As for what towels to bring, there are a couple of different kinds:

A bath towel for you and your lovely bod

Two wash cloths. One for drying your hands at the bathroom sink and to store on the oven handle of the kitchen

This is really for the general stuff, but these towels from Costco are freaking amazing and they help mop stuff up, clean stuff, dry dishes, etc. You can bleach them and get them white again and oml they’re amazing. I wouldn’t clean the bathroom with them if you dry dishes with them, but if you bleach them it kind of becomes a moot point. 

On a side note, this is interesting to know about mute point vs moot point

Storage

There is SO MUCH storage in here. Most of our storage space went unutilized and by the end of the year we dedicated one of the drawers in the bathroom to a friend who came over often because… What were we gonna do with it? 

The storage space includes:

The under sink space (already a TON of space)

4 large drawers

7 shelves where you can store tp, paper towels, dry goods, etc. 

Sink counter → Enough for each person to have one whole of those costco towels as a placemat for their own area

Bathroom Sink

The bathroom sink is really nice to have. A porcelain beauty. You can fill it up with water and use the plug to stop it from draining. You can brush your teeth, spit in it, gargle, spit in it, get some water in your mouth, spit in it, keep brushing, spit in i-

…i dont know what else you want me to say

(don’t mind that it’s the exact same pic as above. I didn’t take many this year)

Toilet

You are going to come into this room and read all of the warning signs on the toilet. It will be scary until you realize it’s a toilet and you are stronger than the porcelain throne that you sit upon. 

A couple of things about the toilet area:

It comes with that plunger and scrubber. If you are planning on getting those, don't. (or at least wait until you get there before deciding)

The toilet paper holder:

You should get a bidet. I was devastated in freshman year when I couldn’t get one in the dorms but omg as soon as I moved into the apartments I realized I was free of that burden. 

I got this model but consider getting a different model with a softer stream if you are new to bidets

Don’t get a warm water bidet. There is not any electricity outlet nearby, so you would only waste money getting anything but a normal cold water one.

I got a white bidet because I like to use bleach spray when cleaning the toilet. If you don’t use bleach, you can get a different color.

Note that a bidet is not technically allowed, but literally nobody has gotten dinged by doing this. I’ve had maintenance people come over and not care about it. For the comfort to risk ratio, absolutely bring one! (Besides, why would UCSC get mad at me for bringing a bidet when people bring pets? Bigger fish to fry imo). Just consider covering it up with a towel during the one (1) room inspection over winter break. (also im convinced that our ra didn’t even check our apartment)

Cleaning the Bathroom

Everybody hates cleaning, especially the bathroom, but its gotta be done. The bathroom was actually my fav spot to clean since I could feel a tangible difference after it was cleaned soo…

Here, I focus on tips to clean in the bathroom, but if you want more general stuff and a list for each room of what steps to take when cleaning, jump to here

Cleaning the toilet is best done with bleach spray and a shit ton of paper towels. 

You can use the all purpose spray for everything else

After the move-in clean, I didn’t bother ever cleaning the storage shelving or the drawers again. 

Make 100% sure that you don’t get the spray into the electrical sockets

To mop, I like filling up the bathtub with warm water and pouring a bit of all-purpose spray in there (NOT BLEACH!). Then I use that as my mop bucket. I never used the provided one because it’s most likely all going down the bathtub drain anyway. 

Make sure that you shake your bath mats out. They get so dang nasty. 

Bathroom Outlets 

There are only two outlets in the bathroom, so I highly suggest that you get a plug splitter + night light if you and your roomies plan on having things like electric toothbrushes, hairdryers, etc. I got this one and it worked amazingly for us. (I did have to pry the plastic stabilization nub off for it to fit in there, but it worked great after that)

Laundry:

Pretty much everything with the laundry room is exactly the same as last year except on a much smaller scale. At the bottom floor of each building, there are commercial washing and drying machines run by CSC (hate.) 

Building K

Building J

2 washers & 3 Dryers

2 washers & 2 Dryers



Other Apartment-Specific stuff:

This is just stuff that is different from the dorms you lived in last year.

Keys

You will be given three brass keys by the housing office. 

An outdoor key that can be used to access all floors in your building and both laundry floors 

A key for your apartment door

A key for your room (NOTE: It only locks from the outside, not the inside)

Do NOT lose your keys! Your apartment doors have pretty high-security locks and use really difficult and expensive to copy keys (I visited 3 locksmiths in my town and none of them could replicate it) (you can copy the key for the bedroom though, those are a different kind). If you do lose your keys, it will run you around $50 for each Building and Apartment key lost, and around $25 per each room key lost.Difference in roomates

Difference in neighbors (and their attitudes)

Neighbors are a bit different in the apartments than they were in the dorms. 

They don’t like noise. 

One night me and my friends were playing mario party (yeah…) and maybe we got a bit too loud. We got a very angry note on our door telling us to be quiet, or at least to shut the windows.   The next day we went outside and checked how noisy we could be without being heard, and it turns out that even when on the first floor, you can hear EVERYTHING from the fourth floor. We were very diligent in closing our windows and being at least semi-quiet after that.

There is a discord for the kresge apartments and it’s pretty cool. A lot of people ask for ingredients if they’re missing some, or other things

You can choose to get to know your neighbors, but it is VERY easy to not have any social interaction here.

Random stuff

Windows and Shades

All of the windows and shades are the same crank windows and chain shades from the dorms last year.

The windows are crank windows that open sideways on a hinge. They are NOT the slide up and down windows. This means that most window circulator fans or portable ACs won’t work here unless you do some major rigging to make sure it gets that way. 

Unlike the dorms, you can also take the mesh screens off if you want. (not the window itself but the mesh that keeps the bugs from coming in)

I forgot to get a pic of the inside window but here’s a masterful drawing of how to open the window in its stead: 

(inside and outside of the windows)

(The shades are the same in the bedroom on a smaller scale. In the bedrooms, there are two sets of shades since there are two windows per bedroom (one to the outside and one to the common room. Why? I HAVE NO IDEA))

Thermostats

A bit different from the Kresge dorms, these thermostats are old enough to where they don’t care if the window is open. But, the radiators don’t work all too fast, so don’t get your hopes up. 

Here’s a picture of the common room thermostat:

The common room thermostat can be programmed day by day. This isn’t the exact manual, but it’s pretty similar. Consider just keeping it “on” all the time and adjusting the temp how you want it every couple of weeks. 

Here’s a picture of the thermostat in the bedrooms: 

There is also some function with the radiators themselves, but I never bothered to figure it out. If you know what the switch in the radiators does, let me know!

All Purpose Cleaner

I mention all-purpose cleaner a lot in this document, and with good reason! It is my absolute favorite thing to use for everything to do with cleaning. Kitchen stains, someone missed the toilet, carpet, couch, everything! UCSC provides us with the stuff for free, so you better good and god damn use it!!! If you run out, just ask for a new bottle through CruzFix and they should drop it off to you. If you run into trouble with someone saying that’s not a thing, just email back saying it has historically been done, so why not now? GET YOUR TUITION’S WORTH!!!

Breakers

You will have a breaker panel this year. Chances are it is already labeled for all of the sockets and ranges. You probably won’t ever have to mess with this, but it’s a good idea to know about. It’s also a good way to mess with your roomies since most of the lights are connected to the same breaker. 

Rooms facing the road vs facing the meadow

From the perspective of someone who had a room facing the meadow: 

If you have a room facing the meadow, the heat is BRUTAL during the fall. Do as much as you can to combat this. A tower fan is fine, but also wet some washcloths and put them in the freezer for a cool neck. Make sure you keep the windows closed, and (tip from my dad for my next year) consider even putting an extra layer of blankets over the blinds to keep the heat out. 

While you will have more privacy from onlookers versus the people across the hall from you, you are not totally private, especially if you are on the ground floor

For the people who are facing toward the street: 

I’m sure that it’s at least a bit cooler when facing away from the afternoon heat, and you can decorate your windows for the people outside. You may have less privacy than the people across the hall from you though (i’m not weird for glancing into people’s apartments while walking down the street, right?).  As for major differences?? Idk lol.

ANTS 

Ants SUCK. I am so sorry to everyone on floors 1 and 2, but you will almost certainly have ants and other bugs. (Floors 3 and 4 supremacy) 

UCSC tries to get them during the summer, but it doesn’t always work out that way, so here are some ways to combat ants:

Make sure all food is in the fridge or at least all food is sealed in tupperware

Make sure to sweep and clean often

Be on the 3rd or 4th floor… suckers hahahah

Submit a ticket to CruzFix.

Don’t waste your own money on this. I don’t care if google says that coffee grounds and vinegar and borax are good to get rid of ants, ants are grodie and I am absolutely not that crunchy mom on social media who uses random crap around the house (i hate her so much). Just ask CruzFix to place a couple of traps and they should be gone eventually.

Make sure that if you see a bunch of ants, fix the problem fast. You don’t want this to keep going on.

 RAs

As far as I know, the RA situation is split between 3 RAs as the construction of the Kresge offices continues. 

There are two RAs for Kresge K (one per 2 floors), and one RA for the whole of building J (since there are only 3 residential floors and 1 floor with only offices)

They will invite you to the housing discord where you can ask for help with stuff, which is nice. 

Parking

There are a couple of qualifications that UCSC requires you to have to make parking on campus a possibility. I made the flowchart below with what I believe are the qualifications, so check it out! Consider doing your own research too though. 

If you can’t get a parking pass, it isn’t the end of the world. Just get a ZipCar account and you should be fine for things like shopping

 NOTE: Off-campus people can get C permits, on-campus people get priority though. (i think… no promises tho)

ZipCar

Having the ZipCar app is pretty cool, and is a useful app for when you want to rent a car to go somewhere.

I suggest that if you and your roomies plan on taking a trip to Costco or something for a couple of hours, definitely get it!

The fee to use the app is $50, and renting the car is around $14/hour. It does get pretty steep if you don’t split it with friends, so definitely bring people along who you can guilt into splitting the cost with you.

Mail

The mail system is going to be the exact same as last year, however you will receive a new PO box number, so make sure to update your stuff. 

I go in-depth about this on my Kresge Newbies document, so take a look!

What to bring:

Here, I will not only give the checklist meant for apartment folks, but also tell you what you may not need to bring this year compared to last year. 

Included apartment supplies (not furniture)

General Cleaning Supplies

Broom & Dustpan

Push sponge mop (pretty crap ngl)

All purpose cleaner

Bucket

Bathroom stuff

Plunger

Bristle Brush for toilet

Shower Liner (But absolutely bring your own though. Theirs is probably narsty)

UCSC Apartment Checklist

Pictures of apartment life:

This is the photo album of what apartment life looked like for me last year.

Thanks

I hope that this guide is helpful! Chances are, you already knew the ropes if you are moving into this apartment, so hopefully this gives you a bit of a leg up and could soothe your anxieties. I will be in the Kresge Apartments again for the 25-26 school year, so I hope to see you there! :)

If you have any suggestions for what I should put in or if you just wanna say “HELL YEAH BROTHERRRR” let me know!!! I love hearing what I can do to make this stuff better from people. I like using google forms since r/UCSC archives their posts after \~6 months, so you can reach me there! 

Soon I’ll be posting more stuff for archive on this website (but it may take years lol).

1mzg31w,https://i.redd.it/k9065oly53lf1.jpeg,996 vs 997,"Hey everyone, long time observer, first time poster on this sub. I wanted to share my thoughts on the 996 vs 997 experience after driving a 997.1 CarreraS, while owning a 996.1 Carrera 4 (both manual Cabs):

Upon entering the Brighton Porsche dealership on a sunny weekend in Melbourne Australia, I was greeted by a lovely and un-assuming salesman who let me explore the cars on offer without presumptions or prejudice. I initially sat in a 992 CarreraT which felt premium, tech-laden and HUGE! Maybe I was intimidated by the un-familiarity, the size difference or the sticker price, but I concluded it was not for me. The 992 was unnecessarily large, with the seating position too high and I struggled to see over the bonnet without adjusting the seat to an almost SUV-like height (I’m 5ft9/175cm). It provided no more rear seat comfort, cargo space or amenities over my diminutive 996 (unless you call screens and buttons amenities).

Sensing my dissatisfaction and tech aversion and spotting my old 996 outside, the salesperson mentioned a used 997 Cab that we can have a look at in the used car yard. Coffee in-hand, we took a short stroll and came up behind a silver 997 CarreraS. My first impression, seeing the 997 from the back, was how identical it looked to the 996 - and that’s not a bad thing. The classic taillights and rear arches were perfectly positioned and the proportions spot on. You don’t mess with perfection - and Porsche did well to keep a good thing going. Coming around the front the difference was obvious - the ol’ “fried egg” versus classic headlights which been debated in the lands of the internet since the dawn of time. Naturally, I must add my own 2c and say that the 996 front looks less aggressive than the 997 and has a certain uniqueness among the 911 lineage. Whether that’s good or bad, is up to individual preference.

Getting inside the contrast between the two generations became even more apparent. The 997 felt more modern, more premium and slightly larger than the 996. It was easy to find a good seating position and feel at home with all the familiar controls (though the drop top button took some time to find). This again is a matter of personal opinion but I feel that the 996 interior design has aged better than the 997 and the curves of the 996 are more “classic” over the straight lines of the 997. The big ol’ infotainment unit in the middle of the 997 does not help either, but that can be easily upgraded to the modern PCCM (or an aftermarket solution) just like the 996. For the convertible lovers, the 997’s soft top is much quicker to retract and much less clunky over the 996 - a testament to Porsche’s continuous improvement approach.

Putting the 997 in gear and another difference emerged - the shifter effortlessly glided into gear with a short throw and the clutch pedal was light, yet familiar enough to find the bite point. Rowing through the gears felt smooth and easy, yet I found myself longing for the more mechanical and direct feel of the 996 shift. Perhaps if daily stop-start traffic was the driving scenario I would prefer the 997 lighter engagement, but on a windy road or accelerating onto the freeway, I’d take the 996 notchy, more direct and involved feel any day.

Pulling away from the dealership the power and torque delivery of the 997 was worlds apart: While the 3.4L in the 996 can feel docile until about 4,000rpm, the 3.8L in the 997 delivered torque from ~2,000rpm and kept pulling all the way to the 7,200rpm redline - delivering the addictive howl and aural experience of the flat-6 we all know and love. The 997 was probably also quicker to 100km/h (62mph in Yank-speak) but we don’t care about that! The noticeable difference was in how much less forethought and effort it required to get going - I could cruise along in 3rd or 4th gear, plant my right foot and get an immediate response - no downshifting required. The 996, on the other hand, requires more deliberate engagement and consideration of the next move to extract the most out of the available power and torque. This is not a criticism of either the newer 3.8L or older 3.4L, but a matter of preference and the cost of progress. The 3.8L in the 997 was smoother and more suitable for everyday driving, while still delivering an exhilarating performance. The 3.4L in the 996 is more raw and satisfying to operate but is objectively slower and less powerful.

Lastly and possibly most importantly for us Porsche enthusiasts - the ride, handling and steering feel/performance. This was probably the most difficult thing to discern between the 2 generations - even with my professional experience as a suspension engineer, both generations are tuned so well that if I were blindfolded (not recommended for everyday driving) and ear-plugged I may struggle to tell them apart. The 996 feels light, raw and direct. It takes mid-corner bumps and undulations in its stride, but lets you know exactly what is happening with each tyre and how its weight is shifting. The steering feels delicate at corner entry, gets perfectly heavier as you load it up and progress through the apex, and then lighter again as you exit the corner and add power. The 997 built on all of the above qualities, adding an air of confidence and assurance that it “got you” both through mechanical grip and electronic stability should things go wrong. The limits of grip in the 997 were pushed ever so slightly further, but not to a ridiculously high and unforgiving point. The ride was improved enough to be noticeably more comfortable but never got soft or soggy. Again, evolution and continuous improvement is the core of the Porsche 911’s success - the 997 didn’t feel like a “game changer”, but it never needed to be when the 996 already won the game!

To conclude or as a TL:DR, both 996 and 997 are driver focused, enthusiast-pleasing emotion-evoking vehicles. Both connect road and machine to driver in an unparalleled manner and strike an unmatched balance between excitement, rawness and sportiness to familiarity, class and usability. The 997 being newer is more usable, refined and faster vehicle, but it loses some of the charm, driver involvement and mechanical feel. It is also (as of 2025) double to triple the price, and in my opinion, an evolution not a revolution of the 996.

#1 moon milk (guava cheesecake) - super interesting flavour, it wasn't even on our hit list but we just happened to stop in on our route. Will definitely go back for a pint
#2 earl Grey SS (roselle) - obviously good, everything roselle does is good
#3 Vietnamese coffee (ruru baked) - delicious, my favourite texture of everything we ate. I'm the most likely to go back here in the future due to location (also they give real spoons instead of wooden sticks!)
#4 burnt honey ss (soma) - very strong honey flavour, I really liked it, but would have preferred on a cone without these awful cardboard spoons. Super generous portion too
#5 blueberry lemon curd (scooped by demetres) - another really strong flavour, only ranked a bit lower because it was super firm. I'd crush a pint of this at home for sure, loved how lemon forward it was.
#6 apricot thyme sorbet (good behaviour) - very interesting, not totally sure it worked, but i appreciate something unique. We originally ordered the pistachio baklava but it was super crumbly and honestly really gross, the staff kindly gave us a scoop of something else. Ill give GB another chance since I go there for sandwiches all the time, but a bit of a bummer considering how hyped up it was
#7 blueberry sorbet (venerosa gelato) - not good. Super gummy texture, we actually tossed this one out. Not sure why we got a sorbet at a gelato place to be fair.

1. The Declaration of Devotion

Stand before the moon (or nearest window).

Recite: “From this day forward, I honor the catgirl — embodiment of softness, silliness and beauty.”



2. The Milk Offering (Moon Rite)

Every fortnight, place a small bowl of milk (or sweet drink) outside under the moonlight.

Whisper your wishes — believing the cosmic catgirls lap them up and purr back blessings.



3. The Ten Commandments of Catgirlism

Study and follow them as doctrine (nap often, embrace life, seek warmth, etc).

Breaking them brings “bad meow karma” — stubbed toes, tangled headphones, and spilled drinks.



4. Daily Acts of Reverence

Offer headpats (to pets, friends, and strays)

Share treats and sweets in the name of the Catgirl.

End the day with at least one “meow” of gratitude.



5. The Purr Meditation

Once a week, hum or purr for 5 minutes in stillness. This aligns your spirit with the Great Cosmic Kitty.



6. The Sacred Nap

Midday naps are holy. Extra points if in a sunbeam or curled blanket pile.

Skipping naps is frowned upon unless bribed with coffee.

1mzftty,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingAddiction/comments/1mzftty/thought_i_was_different/,Thought I was different..,"I was in denial I guess. Or justified what was going on somehow..

This all started about a month ago. Although im no stranger to the casino. I always enjoyed my monthly visits. Annual vegas trip ect but a month ago I won about 5K in 1 hour of craps. 

I visited again with just $200 and left with $1000 and again another $2000. Suddenly my depression was cured. Im already financial comfortable - not wealthy just comfortable. So having $7000 sitting on my kitchen counter was cool. But I didn't want to spend it...I ate good and bought small things (under $100). 

I wanted that cash to keep going. Afterall, I would win with just using $200-$400. I figured i could keep that money to go everyday....the timing just so happens to be when I am laid off. Again, not an issue financially. The layoff was planned too.

So there is was...at the casino everyday. I organized my day to fit around the casino. I am an Avid saltwater fisherman. Id go 3-6 times a week. Guess what. I only went once a week for a month and each time I cut it short so I could hurry home, shower and have a great evening at the casino. 

Which by the way, I wanted everything perfect. I showered, picked out nice clothes, got a coffee, did my chores just to make me feel ""productive"".

It was awesome. Like I mentioned, I have chronic depression..some days are tough. But for the last month.. cured! I was always excited for my evening out or the next morning at the casino.

...but then it started to get old...I started losing. $200, $500, soon $1000 per day...with an occasional win to offset it a little. I started feeling ""dirty"" knowing I was one of the guys that kept coming back. Omg I never knew some people live at the casino. 100% the same people are there...so was i...

I began to realize this is unsustainable...I now had $3000 left sitting on my table. I knew 100% that would all be gone soon...so today I took $2500 of it, put it in my bank, and opened my app and sent $2500 to some debt of mine. 

I still had $500 left from my stockpile..I said I will go play once more.. if i win...I'll consider saving some but certainly apply more to something important...well i didn't win. It wasnt all that fun either. Left with $200. I feel good about it. Got some closure...I wont gamble my hard earned money... well maybe $200 of it.. so i wont want to go back now that my stockpile is finally gone.

I will need to address my depression. My desire to go will kick in and fighting it will hurt but im willing to accept that.

The urologist said it's most likely ketamine cystitis so the cause of it is a bit different, but I find that the symptoms are almost identical to interstitial cystitis. Progress is painfully slow and gradual but it's being made. I'm getting a second opinion soon but am struggling to properly word and describe the symptoms I'm dealing with and I would really appreciate it if y'all could describe how your symptoms show up and what they feel like to you?

Right now for me they are:

* Urethra sensitivity and pain: Often feel stinging/burning pain in the tip of the urethra, which persists for a couple hours after I urinate. Almost feels like I'm holding in a couple drops of acidic pee at the very tip and feels a bit like a sunburn internally irritating me there.
* Sense of urgency: Often I feel a sense of urgency multiple times in an hour and when it's bad it's multiple times a minute. Just feels like when you break the seal when you're drunk and always feel the need to pee, but when you actually try to not much comes out (not a retention issue but just because the tank is mostly empty)
* Sense of frequency: Increased frequency of going to the bathroom, but mostly due to the increased sense of urgency. Not really a big issue as I don't wake up in the middle of the night to pee or anything so I think it's mainly caused by the sense of urgency
* Tingling sensation near bladder: Sometimes I feel a tingling sensation near my bladder for no reason. Its almost like what I imagine butterflies in your stomach feel like from anxiety, but just in a different location
* Foods causing worse conditions: All these issues get worse for a few hours when I drink coffee, orange juice, or something high in artificial sugar. Or if I eat sweets or foods high in artificial sugar.
* Aching in the bladder: Sometimes there's a general achiness in the bladder region. Not sure why or how it happens but it's uncomfortable as it almost feels as if someone is mildly squeezing your balls or something.",1,1756091946.0,Interstitialcystitis,0,1.0,False

1mzfpqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1mzfpqu/no_proper_closure_still_in_love_trying_no_contact/,"No proper closure, still in love, trying no contact","I’m 19M, and my ex is 18F. Our relationship began in 2022 and lasted two years—one year face-to-face and the second year as a long-distance relationship (LDR). I was her first boyfriend, and she was my first girlfriend.

Our relationship was filled with connection, bonding, deep talks, and chemistry. She fell for me first, and then I fell for her. We also played the same sport and shared many common interests. We were very much in love and had already made commitments to each other.

We built a strong history: gifts on our monthsaries, future plans, inside jokes, deep talks, and dates. She even picked up some of my mannerisms, and I picked up hers. Over time, she opened up about her insecurities—her looks, her fear of being replaced (due to her past “mutual understandings” where guys cheated), and her parents always comparing her to others. I constantly reassured her, gave her attention and love, handled her emotions, reminded her she was beautiful, and stayed by her side. Since her parents didn’t give her much attention, I tried to fill that role for her.

She gave me love and affection in return. She supported me, was my number one fan, and because of her, I believe I matured too. Still, I was usually the one putting in more effort. I saved money to travel eight hours just to see her because her parents were strict. Even during LDR, I made handmade gifts for her. But eventually, I started noticing changes. She stopped making gifts for me—which I didn’t complain about—but then other shifts followed.

She began posting lip-syncing videos on TikTok and enjoying compliments from guys, something she never used to do. She had always rejected other guys’ attention and only focused on me. She also kept bringing up the time I betrayed her trust earlier in our relationship, when she saw I was following girls and NSFW accounts. That made her feel like she wasn’t enough. I changed and stopped completely, but I guess it was too late for her to fully forgive.

What confuses me the most is that, even two weeks before the breakup, she wasn’t showing signs of detaching or falling out of love. When I visited her, we were genuinely happy. We made TikToks together, teased and flirted with each other, and still had our deep talks. Everything felt normal, like we were still very much in love. Then, out of nowhere, the breakup happened.

The breakup itself was messy. Before it, we had a fight because a guy she knew from 2nd grade suddenly wanted to meet up with her. I didn’t approve because, realistically, why would a guy who isn’t even close to her anymore suddenly want to hang out? At first, I allowed it since her mom was supposed to come, but something happened, so the meetup didn’t happen. Later, I found out she had gone to see him without telling me. She insisted it was just a “friendly meetup,” but the plan was to eat, go to a museum, and grab coffee—which sounded more like a date. I got upset and explained why I didn’t approve, she got defensive, and in the end, the meetup didn’t happen. Soon after, she broke up with me over text. She admitted the breakup wasn’t about that guy or the meetup—it was “more than that.”

Her reasons were:

Lack of individual growth: She said LDR had become the same routine—calls every night, playing games, the same jokes. I suggested alternatives like movie nights or different activities, and I even traveled to see her, but it wasn’t enough.


Turned off by my outlook on college: I was a freshman in engineering, struggling with the reality that failure is normal in college. I told her that, but she didn’t like it. She even asked, “If your friends can pass, why can’t you?” That hurt me a lot. She also believed failure in college “isn’t normal,” even though she hasn’t experienced it herself.


Uncertainty about the relationship: She admitted she wasn’t sure if this relationship was what she really wanted.


When I asked if there was a chance of getting back together, she said, “I’m not sure yet.” That made me chase harder, but eventually, she begged me to just move on. After three weeks of chasing, I finally stopped and focused on myself.

What disappointed me most was what she did after the breakup. She started posting thirst traps and jumped from talking stage to talking stage. The last one was with her “crush.” She tried to make it work with him, but it didn’t last—partly because she hasn’t healed, and partly because she compared him to me or expected him to treat her the way I did. Her moods seemed to cycle: regretting the breakup, convincing herself it was the right choice, and then rewriting our story to make me the bad guy.

Now it’s been two months of no contact. Her fling with her crush didn’t last, she isn’t posting as many thirst traps, she’s been reposting sad content, showing signs of longing for a relationship, and even stalking me again. Meanwhile, I’ve been rebuilding myself. I cried for weeks after the breakup, but eventually I picked myself up: went back to my hobbies, improved my looks, started going to the gym, reconnected with friends, tried out a business idea, and went back to church.

But I’ll be honest—sometimes I still feel sad and miss her. I miss the version of her that existed before all this, even though I know she’s gone now. What still hurts the most is the lack of proper closure. Her reason of “we weren’t growing” just doesn’t feel like the full explanation, especially considering how happy we were just two weeks before the breakup.

And here’s the part that confuses me the most: this week, I realized I’ve lost a lot of respect for her because of her actions after the breakup. But what bothers me is that I still love her. It’s like my mind sees who she has become, but my heart still holds on to who she was.

It’s also really hard to move on since there was no cheating, no abuse, and our relationship wasn’t toxic. I even tried framing her as the bad guy to move on, or tried dating apps, but nothing lasted—I just ended up back to loving her. It’s really hard to hate someone you truly loved.

At the same time, I know I’m not ready for a new relationship yet. I don’t want to hurt someone else when I’m still healing from this
So I guess my questions are:
How do I finally get closure when she didn’t give me one?


How can no contact help in my situation? Does it eventually get better?


Do you think she’ll eventually regret the breakup or mature and try to come back?


Was “growing individually” really the reason, or is she just still discovering herself?

# Choosing The Right Nescafe Blend

Choosing the right Nescafe blend can make your coffee experience delightful. Various blends offer unique flavors and aromas. Selecting the perfect one enhances your coffee ritual.

# Understanding Your Taste Preferences

Identify your taste preferences first. Do you like strong coffee or mild? Nescafe offers a range from bold to smooth flavors. Decide based on your desired taste experience.

# Exploring Nescafe Varieties

Nescafe has several blends. Classic, Gold, and Azera are popular choices. Each blend has distinct characteristics. Classic is rich and bold, Gold is smooth and aromatic, Azera is intense and full-bodied.

# Considering Roast Levels

Roast level affects coffee flavor. Light roast is mild and fruity. Medium roast is balanced and flavorful. Dark roast is intense and bold. Choose based on your flavor preference.

# Checking The Ingredients

Inspect the ingredients list. Some blends have added flavors. Others are pure coffee. Ensure the blend matches your dietary needs. Choose wisely for the best coffee experience.

# Trying Different Blends

Experiment with different blends. Taste each to find your favorite. A blend can surprise you with its unique taste. Enjoy exploring the world of Nescafe coffee.

# Essential Equipment

Brewing the perfect cup of Nescafe coffee requires more than just coffee. The right equipment ensures a rich, satisfying experience. Understanding the essentials can transform your coffee routine. Let’s explore the necessary tools.

# Coffee Maker Options

Choosing the right coffee maker affects your coffee’s taste. A simple electric kettle works well for instant coffee. For a more traditional approach, consider a French press. It offers a rich, bold flavor. Espresso machines provide a quick, strong brew. Each option offers a different experience. Select one that fits your taste and lifestyle.

# Must-have Accessories

A good mug enhances your coffee experience. Choose one with a comfortable handle. A coffee spoon helps with accurate measurements. Consistency in taste is crucial. A milk frother can add a creamy texture. It is perfect for latte lovers. A thermal carafe keeps your coffee warm longer. No more frequent trips to the kitchen. A small grinder is useful for those who prefer fresh grounds. Freshly ground coffee can elevate your brew.

# Optimal Water Temperature

Achieving the perfect cup of Nescafe coffee is an art. One crucial factor is the water temperature. Proper temperature enhances flavor, aroma, and overall enjoyment. Many coffee lovers overlook this detail.

# What Is The Ideal Temperature?

For Nescafe, the ideal water temperature is between 195°F and 205°F. This range allows for optimal flavor extraction. Too hot can cause bitterness. Too cold might result in a weak brew.

# Why Temperature Matters

Temperature affects coffee’s taste and texture. It influences how coffee dissolves. Hotter water extracts more oils and compounds. It brings out rich flavors. Cooler water may not extract fully.

# How To Measure Temperature

Use a kitchen thermometer to check water temperature. Boil water and let it sit for 30 seconds. This usually brings it within the desired range. Alternatively, invest in a kettle with temperature control.

He made that very clear from our first meeting which was in a pretty exclusive place & he was driving a very expensive car. I didn’t act interested at all at first because i was seeing someone (he doesn’t know this) at the time but I did give him my number after he asked twice. (I only mention his net worth because there is a big component in the dynamic, he has a huge ego & feels as though he is the prize, but he is also very busy & focused.)

Since then, he said he’s like to take me to dinner (never happened), & to a new place in my city (never happened). He also keeps saying he wants to bring me on his trips, for example we’d talk about switzerland & i would say something like “yeah it’s nice there i heard” & he would say “ill take you so you can see for yourself”. 

Eventually, I got tired of texting so I asked him to grab coffee with me after work which he agreed to. He picked me up at the train station, opened his car door for me & took me around the city. We grabbed a bite which he paid for & enjoyed our walk. 

After that event, he expressed how intrigued he was with my personality & I have to say we got along really well, i enjoyed our talk a lot. 

He then invited me to his place & we spent all afternoon talking & cooking together. We did this for three days straight. We never got intimate, only a hug to say hi & goodbye. (I’d like to mention here, he is religious & very respectful in that manner) 

He left for a business trip afterwards & I didn’t see him for 4 weeks. We talked almost every day. I did tell him i missed him. He said he did too. He kept complimenting me & showing interest in all ways. He would send me photos on his trip, interact with my story, tell me about his day etc. (he never asks about mine) 

& then he came back in our city & hasn’t texted me at all. Nothing. Last conversation was me wishing him a good flight. The last 3 days of his trip I was the only one initiating a conversation. When he replies he’s still warm, calling me love & sweetheart etc. He also takes more time to reply than before. But he hasn’t asked to see me at all.

1mzfjo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lastofuspart2/comments/1mzfjo7/weapon_swap_glitch_and_unresponsive_weapon_cross/,Weapon swap glitch and unresponsive weapon cross is really hurting my long-term No Return experience.,"Just trying to comment on two things I've experienced in over 70 hours of No Return that I haven't seen anybody talk about, which I really hope Naughty Dog fixes. Failing that, I hope I can give some advice and get some too.

I promise I'm not just whining because I died just now, it's really the cumulative effect of dying WELL over a dozen or more times to each issue. Both issues, as far as I can tell from my perspective as a layman, are related to the fact that swapping weapons/items are tied to animations and that the game is not made for twitch shooting.

First, the easy one to deal with. On PC, when you switch weapons by holding down the number key which corresponds to the weapon slot you want to swap out, if you are pressing the move forward key, the UI will let you open the weapon swap menu, but your character won't actually do it. Again - the game REGISTERS WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO, but won't let you do it. This has killed me so many times, but the fix as far as I can tell is to halt for even just a brief second to swap the weapons. It's unintuitive, because the game clearly thinks you can perform the action it does not allow you to perform but works.

The second one is a real monster of an issue. Swapping weapons or items in the weapon cross does not always swap the weapons. If your character is performing a different animation, the game gets confused and, again, **SHOWS YOU SWAPPING IN THE WEAPON CROSS BUT SIMPLY DOESN'T SWAP**. Sometimes the item/weapon does swap, but takes so fucking long to do so because of the animations that I will die even though I had time to make the decision, perform the swap, and get myself in a position to perform the action, only to find that the character is still digging in their asscrack for the thing you needed thirty decades ago. Then BOOM, you're shot in the head or writhing on the floor. RUN FAILED. I just don't know what to do about it. The game is not built for the crazy situations that happens in especially No Return on Grounded. They require split-millisecond decisions, but the game doesn't DO those. I could brew a cup of fucking coffee, let my adrenaline rush fade away, and write this post in the time it takes characters (for example) to swap from a health kit to a bottle when you REALLY FUCKING NEED THEM TO!!!

How do y'all deal with these issues?

Again, not hating on the game, No Return is one of the most addictive experiences I've ever played and, failing a Factions update, is exactly what the game needed on top of completing the greatest story ever told in video gaming history.",2,1756091263.0,lastofuspart2,0,1.0,False

*The 2025/26 Serie A season kicks off with a battle of regional rivals, where Udinese’s five-match winning streak faces off against Hellas Verona’s Coppa Italia “victory” over a team most people forgot existed. Let’s parse the odds, digest the drama, and predict who’ll emerge from this midfield meat grinder.*

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You’ll Actually Enjoy

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind **Udinese** as the -110 favorite (decimal odds \~1.91), while **Hellas Verona** sits at +400 (decimal \~4.35). Translating that into implied probabilities? Udinese has a **52.3% chance** to win, Verona a **22.7% chance**, and a **25% chance of a draw**. For context, those numbers are about as reliable as a politician’s promise: plausible in theory, but history suggests otherwise.

In their last five Serie A meetings, Verona has taken **two wins** and **three draws**, including a 1-0 victory in their most recent clash in March 2025. Udinese’s five-match winning streak entering this game is impressive, but it’s also the sports equivalent of a cat on a caffeine IV drip—high-energy, unsustainable, and likely to end with someone knocking over a lamp.

The totals market favors an **Under 2.5 goals** (-120 implied probability \~54.5%), which makes sense if we assume both teams’ defenses are still figuring out how to not look like they’re playing Fortnite in slow motion.

### Digesting the News: Coppa Winners vs. “We’ve Done This Before”

Udinese, coached by Kosta Runjaic, arrives with the momentum of a coffee addict who’s just discovered espresso. Their five straight wins are a statistical marvel, but let’s be real: You can’t win five games in a row without at least one opponent mistaking your formation for a “park the bus and hope they fall asleep” strategy.

Hellas Verona, meanwhile, has the Coppa Italia to their name—though their round-of-32 win over Audace Cerignola (a team with a Wikipedia page that’s basically a single sentence and a photo of a cat in a jersey) feels less li

I have no idea what hunger is, or satiety. I only know that I get dizzy and shaky if I forget to eat, cranky if I only drink coffee, and pain or nausea if I eat too much. I seem to get stomach aches if I don't eat for a day. 

I have eaten to accommodate this and because I don't know when to regulate intake and food is actually kind of tasty, I now I have about 60 pounds to lose. I'm pretty sure I could just... stop eating... but that's a great way to hurt my body and I'm over here trying to respect this metaphorically blind, deaf, and mute temple of an electrical meatsuit.

When do you know you are hungry? What level of hunger do you feel before you have to eat? When do you know to stop? 

This is embarrassing to admit and is a real problem for me. Maintaining a healthy relationship with food seems to take up as much mental energy and effort as having food noise does for some people, but in a different way.",4,1756090910.0,loseit,7,1.0,False
1mzfeso,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1mzfeso/first_day_down_thoughts_and_feelings_so_far/,First Day Down! Thoughts and feelings so far.,"I just took my first shot around noon today. I was anxious and a bit apprehensive all week leading up to this but also excited. In the past I’ve struggled with severe health anxiety but have managed to find coping mechanisms over time. A few years ago this would not be a possible pathway for me. 

Administering the shot freaked me out a bit, I kept false starting and just staring at my stomach lol. When I finally injected I felt absolutely nothing at all! No pain no pinch. It was a huge relief. It could not have been easier.

I braced myself for the next hour, mildly worried about sudden nausea or dizziness, things like that. But I honestly felt pretty good and dare I say slightly more energetic than I usually do. I made and drank a coffee as usual, then felt pretty hungry and made a snack plate for my first meal of the day. Had no trouble eating it. Carrots and hummus and some cheese, wheat thins and pepperoni. 

I did a couple errands and felt completely fine, got an iced coffee at Dunkin Donuts. My day was pretty normal all around and I felt overall, the same. 

I visited my Dad around dinner time and he offered to make me a burger as he was making himself one. It smelled really good but I didn’t want to eat something unhealthy and grease heavy. I felt a bit hungry while at his house but I guess less than normal. Normally I have a big appetite at night. 

Then around 9:00 I started to feel pretty tired, I’d say more than normal. I’m usually a night owl. 

When I got home I figured I should make something to eat so I made two small chicken sausage breakfast patties and two scrambled eggs. I ate most of it but as I was eating my mind was pretty blown. I wasn’t scarfing it down fast just eating methodically. I didn’t feel that frantic frenzy to eat and eat and eat, which is something I’ve battled my entire life. Honestly, this is pretty wild: I couldn’t finish my plate and it wasn’t even that much food. Less than I normally eat. I don’t think it’s placebo, I definitely felt full way faster and couldn’t bring myself to finish. That NEVER happens. 

So far so good! I’m really excited to begin this journey. I’ve gained and lost significant amounts of weight many times in my 35 years and this particular weight gain has made me feel unbelievably depressed. I’ve been hiding from a lot of people in my life because I feel so ashamed. I worked really hard during Covid and lost 140 pounds naturally doing the keto diet, then gained most of it back. It’s super embarrassing. The past two years I’ve had a looooot of brutal life events and struggles and food unfortunately has always been my #1 coping mechanism.

I feel like I made the right decision. It was an internal battle for months but now I feel more confident and less nervous. I’m excited to see some transformation by the end of 2025.

1mzfc2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1mzfc2w/valiant_lady_aug_2024_review/,Valiant Lady Aug. 20-24 Review,"Here is my honest, unsolicited review of the Valiant Lady voyage on Aug. 20-24 which went to Key West and Bimini. 

Full disclosure: This was my first cruise, so I don't have much of a frame of reference. I do have an analytical mind and tendency to rank things based on my perception of their value and enjoyability. At minimum, I hope you find this review helpful for knowing what to expect from certain aspects of the voyage should you choose to go.

Embarkation: We were in the last embarkation group. It could not have been smoother or quicker. Virgin's staff was helpful and present. Everything was explained. We got our wearable bands that served as both our wallets and our access for almost everything on the ship. Once we got to our cabin, we were greeted by one of the seemingly endless staff members who explained the room tablet system (it controls lights, television, air conditioner, you name it) and the do not disturb/housekeeping lights. 10/10 from my perspective.

Champagne Cast Off Party: Virgin has a bunch of cute names for all of its events and locations. I find it more helpful to be descriptive. Watching the ship leave Miami from Deck 16 was a blast despite the heat. Although the DJ played an interesting and energetic set (loved the use of ABBA), and the experience was maybe an 8/10 overall, there was not one square inch of pool to squeeze into, which leads me to....

The Pool and ""Hot Tubs"": This is maybe the worst thing about this ship. The pool is too small. I understand that this is a child-free cruise and nobody is swimming laps or zooming around the pool, but there is not enough space in the pool for all of the adults who want to be there to comfortably sit. My wife and I went to the pool once on the sea day and spent a comfy two hours cooling off in it, but the experience was a little overwhelming because we were packed in like sardines and there was a noticeable sheen of everyone's collective sunscreen in the water. It could have been a touch colder in my opinion, although I understand that's a matter of taste. The ""Hot Tubs"" were of course not hot in the Caribbean summer (that would be sociopathic), but they were roughly room temperature and quite comfortable when visited outside of peak hours. I got a little reading time in on Key West day after we had all returned to the ship. It was a nice liminal space moment in what was otherwise a panopticon of aural and visual stimuli. 4/10. 

The Galley: First, I cannot gush enough about how I love that Virgin does not have a buffet. I love a buffet in a pinch, but I will take freshly prepared food served to me by human hands over stale items sitting in a heating pan any day of the week. Again, Virgin gave them cutesy names but just know that each of these items I mention is not a section in a buffet, but a miniature restaurant located within the Galley (or, for Ice Cream and Pizza, mid-ship on Level 7). I love this method of serving any time food to the patrons.

Panini Press - I only had this on the final ""Breakfast Day"" of the cruise prior to disembarkation, but I enjoyed the smoked salmon toast on rye and my wife said the nutella french toast was pretty good. Good smoky flavor, big chunks of fresh-tasting salmon, nice brightness from the onion, and a good sourish bite from the rye. I was less enamored with the avocado toast where the avocado looked piped on and tasted overly acidic. My presumption is that the avocado that is unused from other ship features ends up here (there's a LOT of avocado on this ship and I am not complaining). 7/10.

Noodles - I didn't get around to this one. My wife said the ramen was really good.

Diner and Catch-all - This was both diner food that was open late into the night and whatever specialty thing they wanted to offer that day. On the second full day (Key West day), they had Indian food and it was heavenly. The spiced lamb was one of the highlights of the trip. My wife went so far as to say that it was the second best thing she had on the trip. I had an omelet here on ""Breakfast Day"" that was a little bland. Still, based on its highs I have to give this an 8/10. 

Burgers - The fries here are killer. Perfect level of crunch on a steak fry with balanced seasoning. Generally, I felt the burgers could use a stronger seasoning hand. I had to douse them in ketchup and mayo. That being said, I still made sure to eat four of the five ""burgers of the day"" that they offered over the course of our short cruise. The clear winner of these was the French Toast Burger (french toast buns, burger patty, eggs, bacon, syrup for dipping) which was the standout breakfast item from ""Breakfast Day"" at the Galley. The other three were alright if not memorable. 8/10, mainly for the fries and the French Toast Burger. 

Breads and Sweets - Throw a dart at a dartboard. That is the consistency of this place. Winners: S'mores jar (exactly what it sounds like), pork roll (pork filling in bread, elevated hot pocket), marquise (very winning and wealthy brownie). Not quite a winner, but overhated: ""Valiant Lady"" (blueberry and white chocolate twinkie with tasty shortbread bottom, would be better if there wasn't a ""cream cheesy"" taste to it, loved the pop of the blueberry jam). Losers: other items but especially the chocolate donut (this looked like a super inviting yeast chocolate glazed donut, the donut breading was Dunkin Donuts hard and the chocolate topping was so dark as to be bitter; we nearly wept at the false advertising). 6/10. 

Salad Bar - Didn't quite make this one, to our embarrassment. To be fair, Virgin does a great job of making sure that all the meals are infused with veggies and we certainly did not feel that we were lacking in vegetables throughout the cruise.

Tacos - Delicious. The fried avocado and al pastor tacos especially were amazing. The chorizo breakfast burrito was delicious as well. 9/10.

Bento - Overlooked, but killer. Great sushi even if not judged on cruise standards. The shrimp tempura and jalapeno hamachi and salmon avocado rolls were fresh and light. Whenever I was just a little hungry, this was my first stop. 10/10. 

Popsicles - Always planned on grabbing one, never made it. They also sell champagne. 

Coffee and Soda Stations - Not much to report. Good selection. My one gripe is that the juices were quite watered down. Drip coffee was amazing. I might be the only soul on the ship that did not take advantage of the premium coffee stations. They always smelled inviting and had lines. I'm a drip coffee guy, personally. N/A

Pizza - Fresh out of a traditional oven. We only availed ourselves once to try a pepperoni pie, but it was tasty and chewy and reminded us of NY style. People lined up for this one, mainly while drunk, it's Pizza of the People, open late, and immune to my criticism that it could use a little more sauce, and the sauce could be a little more robust. 8/10. 

Ice Cream - It needs to be said: THIS IS NOT GELATO. It is presented like gelato, but it is not gelato. That being said, it is tasty. I went for the sorbets mainly, mandarin being a favorite, but the classic chocolate and vanilla are winners too. I did not walk past this one while it was open without grabbing at least a scoop. 9/10.

Full Disclosure, again: My wife and I don't drink. Therefore, I am not going to be much help on the bars except to say that Dock House and On the Rocks have excellent mocktails. Drinking a pink, citrusy mocktail from the Dock House and watching Miami disappear as the sun set while lounging on the spacious and comfortable porch on the aft (back) side of the ship while cuddled up with my wife was the single most sublime moment of the entire trip. Another memorable moment from the end of the trip was listening to the Diva (Valiant Lady's resident drag queen) do her deeply personal and moving cabaret while enjoying On the Rock's take on a non-alcoholic old-fashioned. For those two moments alone, 10's across the board for Virgin's bars.

We need to talk about the Social Club.

Aesthetically, this is my favorite part of the ship. It's in a little path on Level 7 that goes down to the Wake (best restaurant, more on that later) and there is a beautiful mural, lots of elegant seating with porticos that show the ocean and our movement through it. I also love the idea of the Social Club. I was pretty happy to see the wall of board games and groups with larger parties than ours (or people who made friends on the ship) could often be seen playing games or putting together puzzles. It was a blast. I also loved Karaoke (sometimes with the Diva, sometimes with another staff member) when it was happening here. We also were present for a round of trivia and planned on doing more. The reality is that you can't do everything you would like to do on a cruise and will exhaust yourself if you try. If we had to miss something, trivia wasn't the worst option because the session we were at was a tiny bit chaotic. Here's the point, as a board game and event venue, the Social Club rocks. As an eatery, it sucks. We are wing connoisseurs. Good wings, such as those served at Razzle Dazzle, are fried hard. These were barely on the right side of done. I didn't try the pretzels, which looked like ball park standard issue, or the milkshakes with alcohol. Based on one item, I don't want to give a negative score but those wings would have been a goose egg.

Our first fancy dinner was Razzle Dazzle:

Aesthetically, this restaurant was interesting. We got a seat by the portico and could see the waves crashing against the side of the ship even though it was dark. The restaurant felt like the red room from Twin Peaks with its white and black zig zags, red and black features, and light bath of red light. I've heard that this was originally Virgin's vegetarian restaurant, and when there was insufficient demand, they expanded the menu to include meat offerings. This is still Virgin's most vegetable-forward menu and its best dishes are largely vegetarian. 

I'll review each item separately at the night restaurants. First, the starters are actually better than the mains. They have a veg and meat option for raw, cured, and crispy. I tried all six.

Avocado Green Goddess Salad - Beautiful presentation, bright flavors, fresh avocado, and that shallot crumble is worth its wait in gems. 10/10

Yellowfin Tuna Tartare - Delicious tuna, acid notes from the onion, herbaceous notes from the pine nuts and basil. 10/10

King Trumpet Carpaccio - Beautiful thin slices, eats very meaty, pickled beech mushrooms create complexity with the earthen taste profile of the trumpets by introducing vinegar, leek provides savory notes and texture. 9/10

Pork Belly - Well cooked, delicious pork belly with salty sweet savory notes. Slaw adds necessary texture. 9/10

Fried Green Tomatoes and Okra - This one was a miss. Overly hard breading that tasted like nothing, chili lime is too muted and not helped by the sauce. Okra is slimy in a way that expands instead of limits its natural sliminess. Tomatoes were brightly sour but ruined by the breading. 2/10

Old Bay Chicken Wings - The decision to fry these hard and use old bay seasoning profile was a stroke of genius. Peppercorn aioli served with it but was not strictly necessary. Single best bite of the meal. 10/10.

Second, the mains were hit or miss but had some clear highs across the smoked, crispy, poached, and braised. I tried six out of eight of them. 

Carrots - Beautiful presentation with the meaty carrots sitting in the fregola. Pitching the sweetness of the roasted carrots against the creaminess of the parmesan and yogurt is genius. Eats a little heavy, but I loved it. 8/10.

Ribeye - Delicious when I ate it rare and shockingly vegetable forward: sweet potatoes, green beans, and crispy tobacco onions. The sweetness of the potatoes and crispy green beans and onions cuts the fattiness of the steak and au jus. Very good bite. Unlike the other offerings, except the ""v"" chicken (which I didn't try, looked too carb heavy/large) this is a big plate - be careful. 10/10

Nashville Hot Cauliflower - Brilliant idea undercut by bad execution. I have a strong spice tolerance. I made it through about four bites of this. The pickles and sauce do not calm the heat down enough for it to be palatable. 1/10.

Blackened Mahi Mahi - Fish was over. Polenta was shaped like a brick and felt like a brick in my stomach. Creamed chard was welcome counterpoint to bland fish, but if there was pepper jelly in this I did not taste it. 3/10.

Braised Leek Malfadine - I don't want to judge this one too harshly because I think my palate was blown out on cream by the time I got to this plate and the two strongest notes here are cream and sour. Also, full disclosure, I was full. A little more hazelnut would help or anything that would provide some balance to that heavy feta would be welcome. 6/10.

Lamb Shank - It's a lamb shank with root vegetables and gravy. Not rocket science, but it wasn't broke and they didn't need to fix it. 10/10.

At some point, I need to get in here that I had a virgin mango margarita with a salt rim and it rocked my socks. Desert was good too, I had both smoky offerings and one baked option. 

Vanilla Bean Creme Brule - The sugar covering did crack, the fruit addition was perfect and the custard itself did indeed have a lovely smoky vanilla taste. 10/10

Dark Smores - Smores Cup in the Galley is a better choice. Ingredients were out of proportion. I would have liked less of the chocolate, more of the toasted merengue, and more of the graham cracker crumble. The chocolate was too rich and I got no mint from it at all. 3/10.

Rum Apple Cake - Delicious, much prettier to look at and defter hand in balancing the sweetness, cinnamon ice cream is delicious and the rum just adds a little bit of bitterness with the sweet. 10/10

I'm trying to keep this more or less sequential. After eating a delicious meal, we went to about 80 percent of the Miss Behave Show (yes, we snuck in late). I don't want to give anything away, but it's basically a game show where the audience is divided into two teams and participates for points that don't really matter. You don't really need to participate if you don't want to. It's a raunchy good time and the hostess has a lot of charisma. 9/10.

Pajama Jam - Seemed like a party. We went over to the area toward the front of the ship and caught about half of it in our pjs. The host of Miss Behave did a great cover of ""Sweet Dreams"" by La Bouche. Definitely a vibe, although we felt like the only sober folks there. 10/10.

Day Two was our sea day. We began it with a little workout which was also kind of a show. V/H/S (Videos/Headbands/Simmons). It was a blast. We wore our head and arm bands and worked out to 80s music. 10/10.

Still wearing our headbands, we went to the impossibly beautiful Wake restaurant for brunch. We were seated near the portico and were able to watch the ocean pass us by as we had a luxurious slow meal. The Apertivo Spritz was a wonderful nonalcoholic choice to accompany the meal as well. 

Starter: 

Razor Clam Chowder - table-side presentation where they pour the cream base of the soup around the freshly fried clams and potatoes. Best chowder I've ever had and I’ve been to Massachusetts. 10/10.

Mains:

Soft Shell Crab Benedict - delicious hollandaise, correctly poached egg, generous portion of soft-shell crab lightly fried, corn cake on the bottom instead of an english muffin. Fantastic. 10/10.

The Wake Benedict - a little dry but the fried pork belly had a good flavor to it. Would have put the Soft-Shell Crab Benedict in the menu as the signature personally. 7/10.

Steak and Eggs - surprise, surprise, the steakhouse has a good steak and eggs. I did mine rare with eggs over easy and had a great time. 10/10.

Dessert:

Crepe Cake - such a brilliant idea for a dessert. Thin layers of crepe between layers of cream stacked high. All of the sweetness from this dessert comes from the strawberry and the candied pistachios (as well as a little texture). 10/10.

After the aforementioned pool time and a little break to reenergize, we went to see Around the World with the Diva. It was a great drag show with the expected costume changes, musical numbers and jokes. Good use of video screens throughout this performance. Cordelia Facade is electric as the Diva. Easy 10/10.

We saw the ship's Variety Show, It's a Ship Show, afterwards. The host was very personable, tying together the various acts with jokes, the dancers added personality to their role as accessory to the host, and the house band was very talented and integral to many of the games which pulled the audience into the act. As someone who has put together shows in the past, I assume that the ""bones"" of the show (host, dancers, and band) are the same on every cruise and they switch out the four variety acts. I don't want to spoil anything, but the four acts on this cruise were very fun and two of them were spellbinding. 10/10. 

We didn't eat at It's A Ship Show because we had heard it isn't very good. As always, I had a wonderful mocktail during the show. I forgot the name and can't find the menu anywhere, sorry. For our second fancy dinner, we went to Extra Virgin:

Starters:

Crispy Artichoke - This one's a little on the tin. It was well cooked and delicious. The caper aioli was a great topper. 8/10.

Smoked Chicken Liver Mousse - I was so scared to try this but I am so glad that I did. It was a smoky umami bomb, and I enjoyed every moment of it. Bread to mousse ratio was a little off. 9/10.

Braised Mini Meatballs - Best of the appetizers by a country mile. The pork and beef mix and sauce were very serviceable but the real key to this dish is the melted smoked mozzarella and crispy pancetta. So good that I almost ordered more knowing that I was eating most of the menu. 10/10. 

Salmon Crudo - New night, new uncooked fish. This was the weakest of the four. The mandarin sauce was a little too sweet and there was nothing else to provide meaningful contrast. Still a beautiful cut of salmon. 7/10.

Fried Calamari - Good breading, good cook on the calamari (somehow not rubbery), and the chili sauce was quite good. It didn’t reinvent the wheel, but it was good. 9/10.

Mains:

Potato Gnocchi - Delicious creamy sauce, good texture on the gnocchi. My only ding is that if there were hen of the woods mushrooms in this, I didn't find them. 8/10.

Gemelli Al Nero Seafood Pasta - Good texture, pleasant pops of seafood, but I got chicken broth from that sauce more than sea urchin. Pleasant heat. 7/10.

Pappardelle Al Ragu - sweetish Bolognese. Eats well and good cook on the pasta but needs a ""kick"". 7/10.

Braised Pork Cheek - Glad I tried it, but it was uneven. Some parts of the cheek were crispier and delicious while other portions were fatty and frankly hard to swallow. Greens and chantarelles helped. 5/10.

Gorgonzola Crusted New York Steak - Delicious, that sharp gorgonzola cheese was everything. The choice to finely grate the brussels sprouts was genius. Favorite bite of the night. 10/10.

Scarlet Night: After dinner, we were pretty wiped and quite full. However, we took some time to watch the Scarlet Lady proceedings. The first little fifteen-minute show was a mood-setting device and it was eerily sublime to see the ship lit up in red. We saw the giant octopus over the pool and sat in the heat for a few minutes before going in for the night. Virgin knows how to throw a themed party, that's for sure. 

Key West Day: We slept in ahead of our booked wildlife ""Shore Thing"" in Key West. What a beautiful place! We actually went ""up the keys"" and saw various wildlife while our guide told us everything about the history of Key West and the surrounding keys. We saw local floral and fauna, crossed the seven-mile bridge, and visited multiple natural parks. One of the highlights was seeing a miniature key deer (they're the size of dogs fully grown). After the tour, we went to Ernest Hemingway House (again, no spoilers, but playing with several of the dozens of polydactyl cats on the premises was a highlight) and ate a slice of key lime pie (tourist price is 12 American dollars per slice). All in all, we spent about seven hours in Key West. 10/10.

The Wake was our third fancy dinner. My favorite meal of the trip. It had low points, but the highs were truly euphoric. We also got to sit by a portico as the sun set, and it was very romantic. 

Starters:

Wedge Salad - My wife actually had this one but I snagged a piece. Very good if exactly what you would expect based on the description. 8/10. 

Hamachi Crudo - Sweet, salty, and sour. The hamachi was nicely salted (if slightly unevenly) and the pickled rhubarb sauce brought the sweet and sour. Probably my favorite raw fish of the cruse. 9/10. 

Roasted Bone Marrow - Elegantly presented, but the buttered brioche unfortunately overpowers the taste of the bone marrow. It ends up tasting more like butter or olive oil. 2/10. 

Mains:

Shrimp and Grits - I've had good shrimp and grits and this wasn't it. Shrimp were in a tomato sauce, there was a single layer of cheese between the grits and shrimp for some reason although it wasn't advertised on the menu. Grits were dry and tasteless. 1/10.

Salt Baked Dorade - This was the surprise hit of the meal. Our waiter, who also served us for brunch and was a gem, showed us the Dorade in its salt covering before plating it. It was juicy and savory and flaky and perfect, the caper lemon butter sauce added so much flavor to it. My wife, who doesn't usually go for fish prepared like this, loved it. 10/10.

Hangar Steak w/ Bone Marrow Bearnaise, Roasted Mushrooms & Asparagus - Perfectly cooked steak, great seasoning and great flavor. As sides, I got the wild mushrooms cooked in brown butter and asparagus, both of which were great. The bearnaise was delicious, very buttery. 10/10.

Filet Mignon - No words, literal meat candy. 10/10.

Lamb Chops - Wife and I disagreed on this one. She thought that it was under seasoned. I thought it was subtly seasoned, but not under seasoned. I dipped it in the bearnaise and kept it pushing. It might also help that I ordered mine rare (and it came out medium rare) and she ordered hers medium (and it was probably medium-well). 8/10.

Desserts:

Baked Alaska - Beautiful presentation with the torched merengue. The refreshing cold of the pistachio ice cream really seals the deal. 9/10.

Apple Tatin - It gives caramel apple. The cuts make it look like a work of art and it tastes amazing. 9/10. 

Also, if you're here and don't drink liquor, get the Ginger Rogers mocktail. It is a Shirley Temple with ginger beer.

Magnets Reloaded - Awesome acapella show. Talented, funny guys. A few genuine surprises. 10/10.

We Fancy Party - We saw the first few minutes of the We Fancy party. It gave me weird vibes that it was in the Manor and there was a dancing ""in the round"" thing going on when there were a bunch of people sitting around at tables and recording the mainly twenty-somethings dancing in front of the DJ booth. The Virgin cast (Happenings Cast or something like that) did a great job of playing off the theme by lining up and snapping fans (not outlawed on Virgin!) to bring people into the circle and give people a social media moment. Again, Virgin knows how to throw a party, but the leering aspect of it didn't sit right with me and the folks at the tables were like half the people in the Manor. 

BIMINI BABY: This day was such a dream. We booked a spot on the sold-out cultural heritage tour of Bimini. I could go into what that meant and how many ways this tour changed my perception of the island of Bimini, Bahamas writ-large, and the interconnectedness of all things and people, but not everything needs to be catalogued, packaged, and presented for public consumption. Suffice it to say that if you go to Bimini, on Virgin or any other cruise ship or context, go on the cultural heritage tour. 

Afterwards, we went to Virgin's Bimini Beach Club. We didn't leave until we were pulled away. There was a Virgin restaurant there called Beach Eats. We tried some of the food there:

Honey Jerk Chicken - So flavorful and perfect. Good heat and sweet. 10/10

Fried Casava and Mango Sauce - Casava was a little stale and the sauce didn't taste like anything. 5/10.

Tropical Fruit Salad - It's on the tin. Loved the use of starfruit. Everything was perfectly ripe. 10/10.

Rum Cake - Subtly sweet and delicious. 9/10.

Red Snapper with Mango Ceviche - not much of a ""looker"" but this ceviche tasted delicious; salty, sweet and sour with firm toothsome fish. 8/10. 

Corn w/ Toasted Coconut - Meh. 5/10.

We were interrupted by a storm about halfway through the beach day, but it passed within an hour. The waves were pretty choppy, but the water was so beautiful and blue and serene. Yes, I got a virgin coconut and drank it on the beach. One of the staff made a fantastic mocktail for my wife that was very blackberry forward and tasty. The pool party was a blast. Whatever they're paying these entertainment staff, it's not enough. 

I may have got some mild heatstroke from being in the Bimini heat for eight straight hours, so I took a little time to rest before dinner. 

Logistics: This may be a good time in this screed to talk about one negative thing that occurred exactly twice in our voyage. Bad logistics. For Bimini, there really needs to be one person waiting to redirect people to the beach club after the cultural tour. No signs, no clarity. I get that we are all adults, but there was never any explanation of an apparent partnership with Resorts World or that they take people to the beach club or how often they operate. Similarly, we were not directed to any particular place to get to the Shore Thing either.

Similarly, disembarkation was a nightmare. Everybody had the same idea to have a large, leisurely breakfast at the Galley (us included), and it was a long line to exit the ship which was made longer by constant jams caused by no one directing traffic. I love that Virgin encourages a final meal on disembarkation day (rather than throwing out its patrons with both hands), but some people in the hallway would paradoxically help with the people in the hallway situation. Overall, logistics was probably a 6/10 for me because of these two issues.

Our final fancy dinner was spent at Pink Agave. We never made it to Gunbae or Test Kitchen. Maybe on the next one. 

Small Plates:

Guacamole - Perfect guac. Love when it has chunks of pure avocado in it. Chips were good too. 10/10.

Esquites - Excellent street corn. Loved the lime-forwardness of it all. 8/10.

Aguachile - Second favorite raw fish at these dinners. Yet more avocado and bright chunks of tuna. 9/10.

Medium Plates:

Enchilada de Pollo - quite dry. needed more (or any) of the salsa verde. 5/10. 

Papas con Chorizo - I only had a bite of my wife's plate. Spicy, savory chorizo and crispy potatoes. 8/10.

Large Plates:

Pescado - bass was over, but the mole verde brought it back for me. Keep in mind that I had mild sun damage when I ate this meal, so my notes are not going to be as detailed. 7/10. 

Pato - mole adds spice and the smoked yam adds both smokiness and sweetness. Duck was perfectly medium and decadent. It was a little cold, but I spent over two hours on this meal so I believe that is on me. 9/10.

Bistec Marinero en Escabeche - ancho sauce and Oaxaca cheese add robust flavor to a well-made ribeye steak. I ordered mine rare and it was just shy of blue rare. I have heard people say that this is the best steak on the ship. It's good, but that honor goes to the Hanger Steak at the Wake in my humble opinion. Excellent though. 10/10.

Deserts: 

Chocolate Masa - Ugly but delicious. It's not a looker at all but this tastes like delicious cake with a fudgy center and the fruit salsa gives it a chocolate-covered fruit moment. 9/10.

Chocolate Taco - Beautiful but icky. It felt like a bottom shelf item from the sweets bar at the Galley. Overly sweet and better for an Instagram photo than a tasty treat. 1/10. 

I also had two virgin Pineapple Agua Frescas that were absolutely delicious and a very good Americano (to bring me back to life).

Untitled Dance Party - Although I was dead tired and full as a tick, we decided to go to the last show of the night that wasn't the themed party of the night (which we missed). As with all the other shows, I don't want to give it away. There were moments in this show that I really enjoyed and/or moved me to tears. However, it just didn't come together for me. The energy of the artists won me back a bit. 6/10.

If you’ve never been to Campbell River, it’s one of those spots on Vancouver Island that feels both peaceful and full of adventure. Known as the *“Salmon Capital of the World,”* it’s a small coastal city with a big personality — a mix of outdoor recreation, local culture, and that classic island charm.

Here are some highlights if you’re planning a trip:

* 🎣 **Fishing & Wildlife**: Whether it’s salmon fishing charters, whale watching, or spotting bears along the coast, Campbell River is a paradise for nature lovers.
* 🥾 **Hiking & Outdoors**: Elk Falls Provincial Park is a must — the suspension bridge over the waterfall is breathtaking. Strathcona Provincial Park is also nearby with lakes, trails, and mountains for more serious adventurers.
* 🏞️ **Scenic Drives & Views**: The drive along Highway 19A hugs the coastline and offers epic views of the ocean and Discovery Passage. Sunrise and sunset are especially beautiful.
* 🍽️ **Food & Drink**: The town has a growing food scene, from cozy seafood restaurants on the water to casual breweries and coffee shops. Fresh, local salmon is a must-try.
* 🛶 **Kayaking & Paddling**: Explore the shoreline or even take trips out toward Quadra and Cortes Islands — it’s a paddler’s dream.
* 🏝️ **Island Hopping**: Campbell River is also the gateway to the Discovery Islands, which are full of quiet beaches, hiking trails, and small communities worth visiting.

Overall, Campbell River is one of those places that combines raw coastal beauty with a small-town feel. Whether you’re there for outdoor adventures, a relaxed getaway, or just to breathe in that salty ocean air, it’s definitely worth spending some time exploring.",1,1756090418.0,AITravelGuide,0,1.0,False

---

Thailand has cancelled 10,000 temporary stay visas to curb abuse of the visa by people living and working in Thailand. There are occasional discussions here and especially FB on people using the ED visa to live in Thailand but not necessarily using it to get an education in a meaningful way.

I also watch a few YouTuber's who are also here on this scheme and wondering if they will be affected by it. Also curious to see if this will affect the DTV as well since people may abuse it by using the soft-power scheme. 

Your thoughts if any?

***Edit:***

I'm 100% in support of this and more as long as it benefits Thailand and the people.

Also I'm reading some comments that people who are fulfilling the requirements for this visa will be able to stay. I don't know the details of the requirements but I'm guessing they are not too ""strict"" if people can buy through an agency. I'm also saying strict in the sense that those who have this visa don't need to be a full-time university student and can fulfill the requirements by attending classes ""part-time"".

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

If this resonates with you, send me a message.",1,1756090306.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.67,False

1mzf86e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianCoffeeTime/comments/1mzf86e/over_coffee_today_ask_yourself_this_what_does_it/,Over Coffee today: Ask yourself this: What does it really take to be saved? What does God expect from us?,"Simple. Look unto him.

More detailed response? Need a tour around the farm to see it? Well first: You’re “looking unto” people to answer that question. So, good luck with that; picking thru all these responses people give you, looking unto people to tell you what it really takes to be saved. So, it’s already sunk. ""Looking unto"" people. To regard what they say as authority for it, when it's not.  Why?

When, God said about EVERYBODY, to the very ends of the earth, that: *“There is not a just man on earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not”* \- Bible. (Ecclesiastes 7:20). That, “*filthy; done abominable works”* Psalm 14:1–3 Like, asking a Pedophile, raped and slaughtered 593 little 4 y/o’s, ask or look unto him to tell you when the Day Care Center opens. Nobody is going to walk after to go ask someone who did that, anything about their kids. Should be you, too, then: Same with people, when not one of them, including me, can save anybody; all condemned.

Like, asking a Death Row Inmate, imprisoned. Awaiting execution, if they would write you an insurance policy on your house, based solely on them. They: without any money; condemned. Will sit in an electric chair for their crimes. Somehow believe: that, if anything happens: A fire, or flood, this murdering, lying packed to the brim with all sorts of filthy works, can verifiably issue you an insurance policy that will “save” your house.  Can't.

But there is one amongst all off us, where the whole pile of everybody: Adam onward, where not one person has accomplished or done the Ten Commandments. No, not one. None. That God in the Bible. Daniel 9:24–27, determined, as God: Alone by himself, that he would do a work with sin. Make himself the payment, where to everybody on earth, he already decreed, and, he’s God over all of it, decreed: “the soul that sinneth, it shall die” - God. (Bible. Ezekiel 18:20), where “for all have sinned” (Romans 3:23), means everybody is condemned to die, like a death row inmate, and not one can escape it. All condemned. That God would do a work with sin, that would:

1. **Finish the transgression**
2. **Make an end of sin**
3. **Make reconciliation for iniquity**
4. **Bring in everlasting righteousness (Daniel 9:24)**  God would do this work with sin himself. He already DID it.

How he determined he would do it, would be in and by Jesus Christ. Daniel 9:25–27 “adds up” to him. That God was in Jesus Christ. Reconciling the world unto himself. Not imputing our trespasses unto us (2 Corinthians 5:19). God did a work, by HE: Took your sins off you. Laid them on Jesus Christ on the cross. Took mine off me. Laid them on Jesus Christ. Did that for your neighbor, next door. Everybody. In your town had this same work done unto them. Everybody in your State, and Nation. Every Nation with everybody just on this earth, it was done unto all of them, by God himself. That, crucified, on the cross - your sins were purged by and in God himself. Satisfied Ezekiel 18:20, because, God paid it. It was God, in Jesus Christ, DID the Ten Commandments. Since it was God did them, everywhere, where I broke them, he already did the work. Made himself the compensation for it.

In John 3:18, Jesus said this: **“He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.”**  John 16:9, Jesus repeats it; that, just not regard God and his work, we sin against him, and, this is the sin now condemns anybody.  Just lowly esteem, or disregard - try to do the work ourselves, say God's work couldn't possibly do it. Not believe him.

Because he made himself the sacrifice for sin, and God raised his word who he made flesh - Jesus Christ - from the dead, where he sits at the right hand of God; because, the work he did is righteous, because, Jesus said, “**There is NONE good, but one, that is, God”** (Matthew 19:17).  So, it's really simply ""who"" to look unto, to answer your question.  He just IS salvation himself.

Asks you to believe on him. AND? This “believe” just means, in the dictionary to “accept as true” what someone says or is, by “who” they are, you just accept as true what they say, so you naturally just follow it to do, because, if it’s true, you can follow it, and it, to you, is a profit. And man, is this ever a profit for a guy or a woman slated for the electric chair, where everybody is slated to go there. Not one can escape it. That you just regard his work. Consider the operation of his hand. What works God has done vs. regard your own or other people. What they say or decree.

And again, what you “accept as True” you will *“walk after”* to *“walk in”* because, you *“look unto”* it is true, is why you believe it. Where as what you “*dismiss as inadequate; faulty or unacceptable”* you do not believe true; it’s impossible to OBEY it; can’t. Won’t. You will “rebel” against it. So, when God says: ***“Look unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the earth: For I am God, there is NONE else****” -* God (Bible. Isaiah 45:22)

Which of these two are you? YOu have to be “persuaded” that is, “reasoned together” with - and the BEST time - is when you just sit there. Over coffee. To consider: YOU- - will either this ""reason together"" will either just be you: alone, with yourself, do it; and I did that for decades. Never looked unto him. Looked unto me and or look unto other people to “do it” what was “good.” - That is, I did not see reason together what he says is “good” or “true” - - or not. Did not regard God or his work. When he tells everybody over the whole earth to “*Come now, let us reason together”* saith the LORD, *“though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow. Though they be red as crimson, they shall be as wool.”* \- God. (Bible. Isaiah 1:18).

Now I see it. It’s so plain and simple. So in my face. Just look unto him. That's what he said to do. There is none else. He already said it. It’s true. AND he’s God, and he decrees it, by the word he speaks. Out of his mouth. That he just makes all the earth and heaven align with, when whosoever of anybody just looks unto him, scripture says in 2 Chronicles 16:9 “*For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.”* \- so he LOOKS for it constantly - his eyes go to and fro over the whole earth, to simply himself - show himself strong in behalf of whosoever of everybody over the whole earth, looks unto him - he 1. *sets them apart for future use.* \[that's what ""save"" means\] - so even if it was everybody who did it, he would simply save them. Because he can. He’s God.

Because, they look unto him. Done. Your tour of the farm is over. This, over coffee.  Did it help?

**What does it really take to be saved? What does God expect from us?**

Simple. Look unto him. There is none else.",1,1756090287.0,ChristianCoffeeTime,0,1.0,False
1mzf85t,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeeshopowners/comments/1mzf85t/purchase_or_lease_espresso_equipment/,Purchase or lease espresso equipment,"Hi there, I am a 8 year coffee shop manager who has recently stepped away from my position while I finish nursing school. I picked up part time work for my friends bakery that currently doesn’t over any beverages but she’s interested in partnering with me to offer coffee. 
I’m passionate about coffee and I have a solid foundation of knowledge surrounding creating quality beverages. 
She had a hot water line installed to function with a commercial brewer that is not currently in use. 
This is a smaller business and I wouldn’t expect the addition of coffee to add an incredible demand but rather enhance the current business model. 
That being said I am torn on whether I should look into leasing options of super automatic espresso machines that are more hands off (and less revenue being that revenue is shared with leasing company) or investing in a commercial espresso machine and the time/energy to train staff on crafting espresso drinks. 

What would you do? What advice can you offer me? 

My background is in restaurant management and I owned my own business for a short period of time. Coffee is a huge passion of mine and I’m excited about the possibility of integrating this into an existing business. ",2,1756090286.0,coffeeshopowners,0,1.0,False

✅Super clean, minimalist rooms.  
✅Bathrooms were nice, with solid hot water + pressure  (not always a given in LU).   
  
✅Location is 🔥 — right in San Juan, walking distance to all the bars, coffee spots, and the beach. ✅Staff were really friendly, breakfast was decent, and you’ve got tons of food/coffee options nearby anyway.   
✅Price is on the higher side for LU, but you’re paying for the boutique vibe + location + views.   
✅11/10 great for big barkada friend groups, travel influencers who want new high quality content and fun families bonding experiences.   
  
✅Overall solid stay, I’d give it an 9.8/10. ONE OF THE BEST HOTELS I'VE STAYED IN ELYU, LA UNION

1mzf406,https://www.catkittyfood.com/ear-mite-treatment-for-cats/,Ear Mite Treatment For Cats,"**Ear Mite Treatment For Cats**

When it comes to ear mite treatment for cats, understanding the signs and symptoms is crucial for timely intervention. Ear mites, particularly Otodectes cynotis, are microscopic parasites that thrive in a cat's ear canal, leading to discomfort and potential infections. Common symptoms include excessive ear scratching, shaking of the head, and dark, coffee-ground-like debris in the ears.

To effectively treat ear mites, a combination of veterinary-approved medications and home care is essential. The first step in ear mite treatment for cats is a vet consultation. Your veterinarian can confirm the presence of mites and recommend an appropriate treatment plan, which may include:


Prescription Ear Drops: Commonly used medications such as selamectin or ivermectin are prescribed to eliminate ear mites.
Ear Cleaning Solutions: Regular cleaning with vet-recommended solutions can help remove debris and prevent further infestations.
Topical Treatments: Over-the-counter treatments may also be effective but should only be used after consulting with a veterinarian.


In addition to medications, maintaining a clean environment is critical in preventing reinfestation. Regularly wash your cat's bedding and vacuum areas where your cat frequents. Moreover, it's vital to treat all pets in the household simultaneously, as ear mites can easily spread from one animal to another.

Monitoring your cat's recovery is also important. If symptoms persist after treatment, follow up with your veterinarian to explore further options or address any underlying issues. With the right ear mite treatment for cats, you can help your furry friend find relief and restore their ear health.

I will be in noisy environments (groups with people speaking and typing) along with general coffee shops and other noisy areas. For an extracurricular I will be flying or driving in vans for multiple hours. I am prioritizing being able to tune out the noise while listening to music.

The music I typically listen to is folk, indie, country/rock, Americana, and alt versions. 
Some of my favorite bands are Jason Isbell, Bears Den, Of Monsters and Men, Shane Smith and the Saints, Gregory Alan Isakov, Jonah Kagen, Lord Huron, Bastille, Michael Macargi, Noah Kahan, and Mumford & Sons.

I don’t really know whether I like bass, mid, or treble more, so I hope from what I said you can glean an insight.

I can afford either one, but I’m not sure which to pick.

If you’re spending time in Abbotsford (aka “Abby”), here are some great spots locals actually recommend — from food to nature to nightlife:

# 🌿 Outdoors & Activities

* **Mill Lake Park** – A beautiful lake right in the middle of the city. Perfect for walking the loop, having a picnic, or just chilling by the water.
* **Willband Creek Park** – If you’re into birdwatching or quiet trails, this one’s underrated. Great for an afternoon stroll.
* **Clayburn Village** – A restored brick village with a historic vibe. Check out the general store for homemade sweets and baked goods.
* **Castle Fun Park** – Not just for kids — mini golf, batting cages, and a retro arcade make it a fun stop for a group night out.

# 🍴 Restaurants You Should Try

* **Bow & Stern** – Known for amazing seafood and cocktails. Their fish tacos and oysters are always a hit.
* **Greek Islands** – A local favorite for generous portions and warm vibes. Great for family dinners.
* **Vi-La Palace** – Fantastic Vietnamese food (pho, vermicelli bowls, spring rolls). Affordable and filling.
* **Rendezvous Restaurant** – Classic comfort food and breakfast spot with a real community feel.
* **House of James Café** – A cozy place inside a bookstore, great for coffee and baked goods if you want something quiet.

# 🍻 Breweries, Bars & Nightlife

* **Field House Brewing** – Probably Abbotsford’s most popular brewery. Chill vibe, rotating craft beers, and a great patio in summer.
* **Old Yale Brewing Outpost** – Another solid craft beer spot if you’re into IPAs and stouts.
* **Ravens Brewing** – Award-winning and often underrated. Small taproom but excellent beers.
* **The Canadian Brewhouse** – Sports bar atmosphere with lots of TVs and a lively crowd on game nights.
* **Phoenix Lounge** – Casual bar/restaurant with live music and events.

# 🍓 Seasonal & Local Flavor

* **Berry Picking** – Abbotsford is *the berry capital*. In summer, hit up U-Pick farms for blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries.
* **Abbotsford Farm & Country Market** (Saturdays) – Local produce, artisan foods, and crafts. Great way to sample Fraser Valley flavor.

**TL;DR**: For food — Bow & Stern, Greek Islands, Vi-La Palace. For drinks — Field House Brewing. For outdoors — Mill Lake Park. And if you’re around in summer, don’t skip berry picking!

1mzewwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mzewwz/right_person_wrong_time_not_a_full_breakup_but/,"Right person, wrong time: not a full break-up, but had to say goodbye to someone I thought could've been my soulmate (separated by distance and life commitments)","I (21F) started talking to a guy (26M) about a month ago. We're both in the same year in college, and he was visiting my college through a summer program, and we ended up working in the same department.

Although we were both working for the majority of the summer, we didn't really talk much until the week he was supposed to leave (I live in the states, he doesn't). Up to that point, I only had very brief, work-related conversations with him.

Then a week before he was supposed to leave, we were messaging each other about work stuff. I made a joke, and that turned into a short banter between us. After that he asked me to dinner for the next evening, saying that he wanted to know more about what exactly I do at work since we were working on different projects.

I agreed, and although there were no clear indications that he asked with the intention of it being a date, it felt like one, and I was pretty excited. I thought he was attractive, and I had been wanting to get to know him better but had never initiated anything because I'm shy and afraid of rejection.

I didn't go into the dinner with any high expectations. I thought this could just be a fun summer fling at best since I knew he would be leaving in a week, and I had no intentions of starting a long distance relationship with someone I barely knew. But long story short, dinner was amazing, and we talked for so long that the restaurant staff had to kick us out because we were there until closing. I learned that we were very similar in a lot of ways, and we also have the same career plans for post-graduation.

I don't think either of us wanted the night to end, but it was pretty late and there weren't that many places that were open, so I ended up just driving us around town for two hours. I showed him random spots, and we talked the entire time about everything, like our family, school, career goals, etc. The conversation felt so easy between us, and I was so surprised at how comfortable I felt with him. It felt like maybe we had known each other in a different life. There was an effortless back-and-forth between us, and I was smiling and laughing so much.

Several times, I asked if I should drop him back off at his place since it was getting late and we both had to go to work the next day. I didn't want him to go, but I asked to be polite. He jokingly said, ""No, don't take me back ever,"" saying that I was the only person he had really talked to this summer and that he bad been lonely. We made plans to go out again, and he joked that we could hang out every day before he left. Making plans again had also been partly justified by the fact that he had paid for dinner (~$85), and I had told him that I owed him. Anyways, we ended up spending 5 hours together that night.

I just realized how long this story is getting, so thank you if you're still reading. I'll try to summarize the next parts as much as possible.

Over the next week, we hung out 4 more times, and of course we still saw each other at work. We got coffee together the second day, went to dinner and saw a movie and talked in my car for two hours the third day, went to dinner and an ice cream place and his apartment the fourth day, and then went to dinner and his place again the fifth day. Besides the time we got coffee, every other date ended up being 8-12 hours long. He was very much a gentleman, and every time he insisted on paying, even for the second dinner that I said I would pay for because I owed him for the first one. In the end, I was able to pay about half for everything because I refused to let him be the only person spending money. But it felt nice because each time he would say something like ""I'll get this one, so you can pay the next time,"" and it felt like he wanted there to be a next time.

We opened up about a lot of personal stuff, and after the day we saw the movie, I decided to be a bit more brave since I figured I had nothing to lose with only three days left. I asked him if he wanted to hang out again soon, and he said, ""if I had a car, I would've already picked you up.""

The third day, when we went to his apartment, we ended up confirming that this wasn't platonic and that it was romantic. However, we both said that we weren't looking for a relationship, and we both understood the impossibility of the situation. We cuddled for a long time, and things eventually went a little physical, and the next night we ended up back at his place again. Sometime in the very early hours of the morning, we started talking about him leaving, and I asked if he ever imagined us being together. He said no and essentially that I didn't matter to him, that he wouldn't miss me and that he would be fine without me. I asked, ""so my heart is the only one that's breaking, yours is completely fine?"" He responded, ""I think ours are breaking for different reasons. Mine is breaking because I know I'm breaking yours.""

I didn't understand why he was saying all these things, after we had cuddled for so long and he had given me unmistakable signals before. He had even said at one point that he thought it would take longer for him to forget about me than it would for me to forget about him. But now he was saying the opposite of everything before, and I was starting to question if I had made everything up in my head. When I told him I was confused about what had been real and what hadn't been, he said he wasn't available and reminded me that he had a lot on his plate (he has heavy family responsibilities back home). He said it wasn't personal but that he wasn't sure he would ever be in a relationship or ever get married because of those responsibilities. I asked if he even hopes for the future, and he said no.

I cried a little bit, and he brushed away my tears. He said he was disappointed in himself for letting us get carried away, and he looked so guilty and awful.

In the end, I didn't get mad at him. I thought maybe he really didn't care about me, or that he had never felt as much for me as I had for him, and there was nothing I could do about it. I let him go, and I told him not to worry about me because eventually I would move on and that time heals all wounds. We hugged one last time, and he hugged me so tightly that I could barely breathe.

It was only a week, and it's been almost a month since he left, but I think about him and miss him every day. I feel like I lost someone who understood me fully, who saw my soul and liked it for what it was. I never had to pretend to be someone else around him or search for words to fill the silences. I don't know if I've ever met someone that I had such a deep connection to.

With the profession we're both trying to enter, it wouldn't be impossible for us to meet again, maybe at a conference, but it's not exactly likely either. But in my heart, I really hope that the universe finds a way to bring us back together.",1,1756089354.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I was supposed to belong here, to find myself.

What I had found was a student body deadly serious about separating students according to the zodiac.

My gaze flicked to an astrology chart on the wall, where the school's least favorite sign had been scribbled out in permanent marker.

The Dean's office was an astrologer’s dream. The Dean herself was my mother’s age, a scowling woman who seemed more shadow than person. 

A projector illuminated constellations across the room, casting her face in eerie white light. 

I had been lazily following Orion across the walls when she finally snapped, and I jerked to attention, my eyes rolling back to her.

""Miss Oliver!""

I nodded, my cheeks burning. 

Orion skimmed across her face, and I found myself mesmerized by how beautiful the star looked.

Her office was fairly cozy, a messy kind of cozy. Books and papers piled around her, empty coffee mugs sat half-forgotten, and star maps were spread across her laptop, their corners stained with coffee.

""It was a mistake,"" I finally said through the lump in my throat.

It wasn’t a mistake.

But it’s not like I could admit that.

For some reason, along with this college’s draconian rules centered around the zodiac of all things, there was one sign in particular that had been outcast.

I turned my attention back to the scribbled-out symbol.

Subtle.

Gemini.

If there was ever a zodiac sign people disliked, it wasn’t Gemini.

I grew up with classmates hating Pisces because no one wanted to be a fish, or Cancer because of the crab. But Gemini?

Gemini was in the summer months, and the constellation, in my opinion, was beautiful.

But not to these guys.

Starting my freshman year, I began to notice how badly Gemini students were treated, especially the guys.

Being a late admission, I was new, along with another kid who, at first, seemed like the class clown. He was friendly enough, introducing himself with a grin.

We were asked for our star signs as an icebreaker, or what I thought was an icebreaker, and he shrugged with a small smile.

""Uh, I think I’m a Gemini?"" he said, sounding unsure, leaning back in his chair.

""Yeah. I was born on June 10th. I’m a Gemini.""

I expected that to be the end of it, but instead I noticed a sudden shift in the air, like he had just confessed to murdering his whole family.

The girl next to him inched away, dragging her laptop with her, while the rest of the class seemed to collectively let out a breath before twisting toward the back of the room.

It was almost robotic, their heads snapping around, eyes narrowing. 

I hadn’t even noticed the four students in the shadows, hunched over their MacBooks. 

The professor’s expression seemed to crumple, his eyes darkening significantly.

""I think…"" He spoke in a sharp breath before seemingly collecting himself. ""You should go join your friends at the back.""

The Gemini kid seemed baffled and a little hurt.

The air was thick, every eye burning into him. I felt like they were looking at me too. The professor's eyes were wide, lips curled, like he might say something. 

But he just shook his head, seemingly gathering himself.

""I'm confused,"" the kid laughed nervously, almost jumping out of his chair when a girl behind him kicked his bag across the floor. He sent her a questioning look.

""Is… is this some kind of joke?""

""Now."" The professor wasn’t even looking at him.

""But…"" The boy tried to laugh. ""It's just a star sign, right?""

""I will not ask you again,"" the professor said stiffly. He didn't move, as if doing so would mean being closer to the boy. 

He folded his arms across his chest. ""If you do not move to your designated seat right now, you're out of my class.""

To my surprise, the boy got up and moved to the back, ignoring students cringing away from him. He didn't speak again, sticking to his assigned group. 

I noticed everyone else had been separated into their zodiac signs.

Leos were at the front, with Sagittarius and Libra surrounding them. The other star signs were harder to make out. 

I thought it was just that class that took the zodiac a little too seriously.

But no.

This thing had spread across campus like a virus.

Students didn't care about their grades or what careers they were going to get. 

Because the star signs at the top of the social hierarchy had the faculty wrapped around their little fingers. 

A Libra girl found out she was no longer compatible with a Scorpio and stopped talking to him.

The entire campus had gone fucking crazy. Including the faculty.

It was only certain star signs that were allowed extra credit and invited into exclusive clubs, while the rest of us were left in the dust. Geminis were either treated like dirt or feared, like they were carrying a contagious disease. 

It was like going back to middle school.

In the sixth grade, I was proud of my star sign. I liked to think I had a secret twin, after learning about the story behind the constellation. Castor and Pollux, twin brothers transformed into Gemini.

I used to draw the twins on the backs of my hands, daydreaming up my very own.

Mina Lucas, a Pisces, called me a two-faced bitch. Because Gemini had two faces. So, I called her an ugly fish.

This was middle school, though.

It's normal for kids to build personalities around star signs.

College students, however, are grown adults.

It was fine to base a crush around a star sign or compatibility. But your whole life? Your social circle and education?

It was bad enough that my classmates were brainwashed by stars, but the professors too? It didn't make sense.

It didn't make sense that my roommate had a mental breakdown the night before because she didn't have anything blue to wear. 

According to her star sign, she had to wear blue to have a good day.

Geminis were either mercilessly bullied by students and professors alike or treated like they were invisible.

I had noticed over the last few days, disgust had turned to fear.

Instead of bullying Geminis, other students steered clear of them.

I saw it contorted on every face, wary of the Gemini sitting near them, and presently, I saw it on my Dean's face.

She was scared of me.

The woman may have seemed in control, but I noticed her finger anxiously tapping on her coffee mug, her gaze flashing to and from the clock on the wall. She was waiting for something, her demeanor tense, eyebrows furrowed.

Every passing minute seemed to unnerve her even more.

""A mistake,"" she repeated my words, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""Yes."" I didn’t look her in the eye, swiping my clammy hands on my jeans.

What was I supposed to say?

I didn't want to associate myself with what I thought was a trend, a TikTok thing that would fizzle out like everything else. 

But I was staring down at a handwritten letter crumpled between my fists, from an anonymous tattletale calling out my real star sign.

The crossed O's stood out.

Who wrote like that?

I had been hiding under the facade of being a Sagittarius, since Sagittarius and Leo seemed to be the ""It"" signs. 

They stood on some fucking pedestal, ruling over campus like some messed-up clique.

The letter was like a slap in the face. I had half a mind to tear it into pieces. 

I stared down at it, my eyes stinging. This letter told me I didn't belong here. 

It told me that because the brainwashed hive mind on campus had decided to collectively despise the star I was born under, I was something to be feared, like an animal.

""Who *sent* this?"" I managed to get out. I squeezed the paper in my fist.

Dearest Dean,

The passive-aggressive tone made my blood boil.

I would like you to know of a traitor amongst you, a Sagittarius by the name of Oliver, who is in fact a Gemini :)

I am SO sorry for ruining your day :(

Anon.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. When I looked up, the Dean's glare was pinpointed directly in the middle of my forehead.

If looks could *kill.*

""I don't know what to say,"" I squeezed out.

She hummed. ""Well, you can start by explaining yourself.""

She had to be kidding, right?

No.

When I looked her dead in the eye, this woman was being serious.

""Miss Oliver, I am horrified that you would disguise yourself as a Sagittarius."" She curled her lip. ""As one myself, I should have sensed that our energy was wrong, polluted with your presence. But I let my guard down.""

I slammed the letter down. This woman was certifiably insane.

""Who sent this?"" I asked again, harsher this time.

""That is none of your concern,"" the Dean said. ""You lied, Miss Oliver.""

""About my zodiac sign."" I sucked in a breath. ""It's really not a big deal.""

Her eyes darkened. ""As you will discover, Miss Oliver, it is extremely important that we know where every Gemini is."" Her gaze flicked to her MacBook screen. ""Especially when certain measures have been put in place.""

""Measures?"" I straightened in my seat. ""What kind of measures?""

Her lip curled. ""You are a late arrival. It is your fault for not arriving on time.""

""You're kidding."" I scoffed. I was done. It was one thing for students to behave this way.

But grown adults?

The Dean couldn’t justify it. And even if she tried, she would be declared insane.

I leaned forward, testing the boundaries. I wasn’t surprised when the Dean lurched back. ""Was it a bad experience?""

She blinked. ""I don't understand.""

""A bad experience you had,"" I repeated. ""With a Gemini.""

The words suffocated my mouth, eager to spill out.

After weeks of feeling like I was back in sixth grade, finally confronting the root of the problem felt good.

""Because that is all it is, what you're all unhealthily obsessed with."" I spoke through my teeth now, weeks of repressed anger bubbling over. ""They're just stars. They don't mean anything to anyone, except children.""

""Miss Oliver—""

""See?"" Tracing along the constellation mapped out on her desk, I prodded each static light. To my confusion, it was the Gemini constellation, which was ironic.

I stabbed at the twin stars, Castor and Pollux, and then Alhena.

I nodded to Orion, projected across the wall. ""Stars. They're just stars. Dead and dying planets, or if you're religious, your long-dead relatives. Whatever.""

I pointed at the map crinkled under her MacBook, and the Dean once again flinched, her body angling away from me.

She leaned back like I was contagious. One of the guards started forward, no doubt to grab me, but she shook her head, keeping that professional, if slightly strained, smile.

""There is no need,"" the Dean said sharply, and the guards stepped back. ""Miss Oliver is understandably upset."" She cleared her throat.

""Please vacate your current dorm and move into the old building across campus where we house Geminis without rooms.""

The Dean stood before I could reply. ""I don't expect to see you in my office again.""

I grabbed my bag, rising to my feet. ""You're not throwing me out?""

Her lip twitched. ""We do not suspend Gemini students, Miss Oliver.""

""But what if I want to leave?""

""Because of the measures in place.""

Something warm wriggled up my throat, and I tried to speak, but the guards were already politely shoving me out of her office.

The Dean's words didn’t leave my mind until I was halfway across campus, out of breath and regretting every word I'd spat.

She’d sent me away with a warning and an order to leave my dorm room effective immediately and move into the old building off-campus. I had seen it in passing, a large, crumbling structure that used to be the student dorm.

The door was broken, bars on the windows. There was no way I was staying there. Couch-crashing in a friend's dorm seemed a lot better.

Elle was a Leo and insisted she didn’t care about star signs.

Coming from a Leo, that was rich. She had the full Leo experience.

I was moving into her room later that evening, playing cloak and dagger with the security guards on shift, when the announcement played over the intercom.

""Starting from 8pm, please lock ALL Geminis in their rooms. It is upon us.""

Elle froze, her eyes widening. Until that moment, she had been unusually quiet, the two of us cross-legged on the floor eating Chinese food. I thought she was just tired from classes.

She didn’t react at first. She sent me a sleepy smile, then said she was going to grab beer from the kitchen.

What I didn’t expect was for her to come back wielding one of her mom’s butcher knives. I stepped back, but her eyes terrified me. Her whole body trembled, fingers tightening around the handle.

Her expression twisted with a feral fear I couldn’t understand. ""Elle,"" I bit back a cry. ""Hey. It's me. It's Smith.""

""Get out."" She sobbed through the words. Her ponytail swung as she twisted toward the door. ""Please. I don’t want to hurt you."" She waved the knife wildly, and I raised my arms, my heart catapulting into my throat.

""You have fifteen minutes,"" the voice drawled, and Elle's expression hardened. 

""I repeat. Please lock ALL Geminis inside their rooms immediately and find a safe place. This warning will expire at 5am. Eight hours from now.""

A sudden bang outside set off my fight or flight, doors slamming and running footsteps. I found my eyes glued to the blade in my best friend’s hand. 

They were fucking serious about this.

The Dean really had turned a whole campus of students against one singular star sign.

Elle’s frightened eyes found me, and I lowered my arms. ""Wait, are you going to stab me?"" I took a slow step back towards the door. ""Because I was born in May?"" 

I couldn’t resist a laugh. ""You told me you didn’t care about the zodiac! You said all of this was BS! So, why now?"" 

Another step, and she squeaked. 

""Do you want to fit in, Elle? Are the other Leo’s making you do this?” 

She didn’t respond, and that pissed me off even more.

Elle didn’t know why she was afraid of me, because her head had been filled with crap.

I raised my arms in mock surrender. ""Why are you looking at me like that? Elle, I'm not going to hurt you! When have I ever...?"" 

I didn’t expect to cry, but my eyes were stinging. I could hear screaming, Geminis being attacked and locked up. I risked a step back, and her grip on the knife changed, like she was ready to use it.

""You are brainwashed,"" I said slowly. ""The Dean wants you to be scared. She's crazy, Elle. Like, delusional! She has some crazy vendetta against Geminis, and she's punishing us!""

Elle choked out a cry. ""Last month,"" she spoke through a sob. 

""One of you got into my room,"" Elle shook her head rapidly, squeezing her eyes shut. ""Just leave,"" she squeaked. 

""I’m sorry, Smith. I’ll explain, I promise. But you need to find someplace else, and it can't be here. It can't be tonight.”

She smiled, but her lips were strained, eyes wide. 

When I moved to try and reassure her, she jumped back, like a deer caught in headlights.

She was terrified of me.

""Lock yourself up,"" my friend said softly, and I realized I had lost her. ""But don’t hurt yourself."" Elle sniffled. ""They can climb through the windows and sense light. They follow it. So make sure to turn them off and stay down."" Her expression darkened.

""Can you promise me something?""

I found myself nodding dizzily.

Elle squeezed her eyes shut. ""Don’t look up.""

My gut twisted into tangled knots. ""What?""

Elle's words set something off inside me, but she was already dropping the knife and grabbing me gently, pushing me through the door. 

I was being shoved out into the hallway, my bags thrown in my face, when the alarms started blaring, red lights swarming the hallways.

I saw shadows darting in and out of rooms, others being shoved inside, while retreating figures made for the elevators.

A boy was violently dragged out by a girl and thrown on his ass. At that moment, I stopped seeing students. Kids. I was seeing wild animals crawling backward on their hands and knees, frightened eyes darting for a safe getaway.

A girl ran into me, dropping onto her knees before catapulting into a sprint.

She was caught by three guys who dragged her away, kicking and screaming.

I had no choice.

It was 7:50 when I found myself standing in front of the old building, halfway across campus, the alarms still ringing in my ears. 

The dorm looked more like a boarding house, with maybe two or three floors. The night felt eerily still, a half-moon poking through the clouds.

There was something glued to the front door, a simple white sheet of paper.

On it, scrawled in permanent marker, was: ""NO."" in bold letters.

The O was crossed, I noticed. Which was familiar.

""Five minutes,"" the intercom screeched, and in my panic, I knocked three times.

""Hello?"" I banged again. ""Hey, can someone let me in?""

I swallowed hard. ""I'm a...""

My star sign tangled in my throat when a crash sounded behind me. I twisted around. A group of students were dragging two others, bound and gagged, hauling them into a car trunk.

My stomach lurched into my throat. I turned back to knock again, only for my fists to meet something warm. 

A shadow stood in the doorway, golden light bleeding around him. 

I could barely make out his face, just a mop of reddish curls.

He tugged the paper off the door and held it out. The handwriting was unmistakable.

""No means no,"" he said, and moved to slam the door. I quickly wedged my heel in the way, blocking it.

He tried to shut the door on my foot, and in my panic, I shoved it back in his face.

The guy sputtered but didn’t try again. I made sure not to let my guard down.

“You told the Dean about me?” I hissed. “I’m sorry, did we go back to sixth grade?”

He snorted. “You can talk.”

More screams rang out behind us. I couldn’t resist trying to slip through the gap in the door, but he shoved me back, quick as a whip.

“What?”

The shadow paused, then stepped into the light. I glimpsed narrowed eyes and freckles. I tried to push past him, but he stood stubbornly in the way.

His eyes were hidden by a scuffed pair of Ray-Bans. “Ah, yes, the traitor!” he said, like he’d been waiting for this exact moment. “Hiding in Sagittarius, thinking we wouldn’t notice.” He cocked his head. “How’s that working out for ya?”

I heard laughter behind him.

Looking closer, I noticed something metal clamped around his wrist.

Was he... chained up?

“Traitor?” I managed to say.

He nodded with a grin. I had no doubt he’d stood in front of a mirror rehearsing these lines. It was either that, or he was a psychopath.

“The secret Gemini,” he said, making a huge show of blocking my way. “You’re actually famous around here! We turned your room into a relaxation lounge, so unfortunately...” 

He dragged out the “ey” sound like he was auditioning for The Joker. “There’s no room at the inn, dude.”

His lips curled into a spiteful smile. Behind me, another crash echoed.

Ice shot down my spine. I couldn’t bring myself to turn, to witness more brutality. The guy stiffened, but if he was scared, he didn’t show it.

He had too much pride. He hiked his glasses up his nose, revealing eyes shadowed by an eerie glow spreading across his pupils. 

For a moment, I thought I saw hurt crumple his expression, but in the blink of an eye it was gone, replaced with a surprisingly convincing façade.

His gaze followed mine.

Another kid was being mercilessly dragged across the parking lot.

When I turned back to him, his expression had darkened.

He slid his glasses back into place with emphasis. 

I swore this guy thought he was in fucking Glee. 

“Have fun locking yourself up,” he said, saluting me with two fingers before stepping back. Another jingle, and he flinched. 

This time, I saw it clearly, a rusted chain wrapped around his ankle and right wrist. 

He noticed me staring, and his lips curled into a scowl. The kid stepped behind the door, clearly embarrassed.

“This is your two-minute warning,” the intercom blared, still loud even halfway across the grounds.

Hearing the announcement, the guy gently kicked my foot out of the way, and I almost fell on my ass.

I could hear voices as I shuffled back. I checked my phone.

7:58.

Fuck.

“Wait,” I managed to hiss out.

He stopped for a moment, letting out a sigh.

“It wasn't hard to just accept your star sign,” he grumbled. “The rest of this school are psychos, but we take care of our own.”

“It's a *star sign*!” I gritted out. “Why are you going along with this?”

His jaw clenched. “You should go,” he hesitated. “The top floor is usually safe. Head to the girls' bathroom and lock yourself up.”

“You're fucking insane!”

I think part of me was hoping he was just trying to scare me, and then drag me inside at the last moment. 

But no, this kid really was throwing me to the animals.

The guy shrugged. “Yeah…” He shot me a grin. “Byeeeeee!” he said, slamming the door a little too hard in my face.

“Asshole!” I yelled, kicking the door. 

*“You shouldn't have sided with the Leo’s!”* He rebuttaled. 

Across campus, the warning lights were still flashing.

*“Why did you do that?”*

Another guy’s voice hissed from behind the door.

*“Because she’s a traitor.”*

*“Yeah, but she’s stuck out there,” a girl joined in. “Aren’t you being a little too harsh?”*

*“Nope. She can sit out there and rot.”*

I left them to argue and made my way back onto campus.

7:59.

Bathroom.

That was all I could think of. I started toward the main building when movement flashed in the corner of my eye. I saw them pouring out from campus, illuminated in brilliant orange from the torches in their hands.

Leos.

I recognized several faces from my class. They moved as one, a large group heading across campus toward the clearing in the woods.

They wore pajamas, normal clothes, like they were going to hang out.

But something in the air, prickling across my skin, told me different.

There were exclusive clubs on campus, but this was on a whole other level.

I ducked, mapping a way to get on campus without being caught.

If I could get to the door and make a clean break through the cafeteria, I could dive into the girls' bathroom next to the elevator.

I dropped to my knees, attempting to crawl, when I saw her.

The bright red hair was a giveaway, her bobbing ponytail frenzied as she joined the others.

Elle.

Another frantic look at my phone.

8:02.

I didn’t expect her to see me. She was looking around frantically, unlike the others whose eyes were set forward. It looked like she was searching for a way out, staggering over uneven ground.

Then her eyes found mine. 

Initially, Elle looked relieved, and then her gaze went to the sky, flicking back to me. She strayed back, before stumbling over, pulling something from her jeans pocket. It was a much sharper knife, the blade glinting under the moonlight cast across the grounds.

“Tell me your name,” she said in a squeak. “I need to know it’s you.”

I had half a mind to question her before I remembered the Gemini boy chained up.

""Smith,"" I gasped out. ""I'm… I'm Smith.""

Elle hesitated. She twisted around, scanning the night, and then turned back to me. Her frenzied eyes searched mine. ""What is my most embarrassing story?""

""What?!""

In two strides, she was holding the knife to my throat, her hand trembling. The steel was cold, and I had no doubt that she wouldn't hesitate to press deeper.

""Say it, Smith. Word for word.""

Behind her, the Leos were gone, with only some stragglers left behind. 

I nodded slowly, trying to ignore the blade digging into my skin. 

This was my new normal.

""You… you had your period in your boyfriend's parents' new car,"" I whispered. ""You still have nightmares about it.""

Her expression crumpled with relief, and she dropped the knife.

""How about mine?"" I urged her.

Elle surprised me with a quiet laugh. ""You barfed tacos all over your crush on your first date,"" she choked out. ""And he never talked to you again.""

I started to speak, but Elle tugged off her jacket, wrapping it around my eyes.

At first, I fought back, but then her hands, and then her fingernails, dug into the bare flesh of my arms. Her touch was reassuring as she dragged her hands up my arms and then grasped hold of my shoulders.

""I told you not to look up,"" her voice came out in an annoyed hiss.

""I didn't,"" I bit back a cry when she dug her nails in further. ""What's happening?""

""I'll explain later.""

""How can you guys tell who is a Gemini?"" I whispered. ""I don't get it.""

Elle didn’t respond for a moment. ""Your eyes,"" she whimpered. ""It's in your eyes.""

""What do you mean by that?""

""Shush,"" Elle muttered. ""Just stay quiet, okay?""

Elle pulled me to my feet, and I staggered blindly, trying to balance myself. ""I'll take you to the bathroom,"" she breathed, shoving me forward. ""But if you tell anyone I helped you–""

""I won't."" I tripped over something, almost falling on my face. The further we went, the more I could sense something… light.

It started as a pinprick behind my eyes, before spreading, light bleeding through the material of Elle's jacket. There was one bright spot of light, and then another, and another.

Speckled illuminations like glitter illuminating the night.

Closer, they told me.

I followed them almost giddily, watching them burn through Elle's jacket. When the sound of thundering footsteps sliced through me, I turned my head, trying to sense where it was coming from.

""What's that?"" I didn’t realize I was laughing until manic giggles spurted from my lips. It was like being high, my thoughts bleeding into cotton candy.

Suddenly, all I wanted was to see the lights. They felt so far away, and yet also like I could reach them, plucking them straight out of the sky. I laughed again, my body a puppet as I reached out and tried to catch them in my palm.

""I said be quiet!"" Elle whisper-shrieked.

""I am!""

I was curious about the light. It was so bright, and I was missing out on fully taking it in. I stumbled again, this time my footsteps tangled. I didn’t hear the voice until it was in my head, a whisper telling me to pull away the blindfold.

It was choking me, suffocating my thoughts and filling me with a taste of her. I saw it, just a glimpse dancing across my peripheral vision.

I had my fingers clawing into Elle's jacket, ready to rip it off, when someone else did it for me.

""Leo. What are you doing out here?""

The voice was familiar, but it was being drowned out.

By its light.

Its song.

""I'm locking her up,"" Elle said shakily.

Darkness made way for light, and I blinked rapidly. I could sense my head tipping back, and then Elle's fingers in my hair, trying to shove my head down.

Blinking rapidly, I saw the Dean of the college, and my best friend's pale face.

And then I saw the stampede suffocated in shadow, silhouettes passing me, ethereal light illuminating otherwise vacant eyes. The lights resembled stars themselves, dancing through the night.

It was the same light that was seeping into me. It felt cozy and warm, already ignited inside them.

I could tell who they were from their attempts to lock themselves up. 

I glimpsed handcuffs around wrists, makeshift ropes still clinging to arms and ankles, duct tape over mouths. 

When my gaze followed the horde, I caught sight of a cuffed ankle, a stray chain trailing behind him, the guy who locked me out. 

He moved slowly, like a zombie. His glasses were awkwardly placed on the top of his head, eyes drowned by that… that light.

I caught a slight wrinkle in his brow. 

When the others matched forwards, he stumbled back for a moment.

*Was he… pretending to be part of the hoard?*

He was a good actor, perfectly mimicking the others. 

His head was tipped back, arms by his sides, eyes forward, unblinking. 

His gaze flickered to me, lips mouthing five single words. 

**Do not fucking look up.**

But I couldn't *not* look. 

The light was teasing me, seeping into me like honey.

It wasn't moonlight. I could glimpse the crescent glowing under the clouds.

Geminis.

They were bathed in it, a swimming glow I wanted to dive into.

All of them.

Where were they going?

Unlike the Leos, their expressions were blank as they staggered along, akin to a crowd of zombies. I remember not being able to concentrate on the Geminis.

Something was holding onto me, winding its way into my brain. 

I felt it reach directly into the back of my head, phantom fingers taking me into its grasp. I didn't mean to look up. I tipped my head back, drinking in the sky above me, and the night that suddenly felt alive. 

In the corner of my eye, the Gemini guy was grabbing his friends, pulling them into the trees. The Gemini horde stopped suddenly, heads tipping back, glowing eyes following suit. I blinked twice. 

Elle was already covering my eyes, and I wrenched her hands away so I could see… clearly.

I could feel it, sense it, consuming me, filling my thoughts with a lulling fog.

""Smith!""

Elle's eyes found mine, and she dropped to her knees. Like she was scared of me. 

I remember her lips had formed the words in breathy sobs. **Don't look–**

Before she could reach up, I blinked again, and this time it was a longer one.

I started toward… something…

It was there. I just had to reach as high as I could.

Then I would be able to… touch it.

Starry eyes surrounded me, but I don't remember being scared. 

Elle's cry rattled in my skull as I felt my body lurch on its own, driven by something else, a sentient thing inside me. 

I could feel my mind filling with fog. It told me to go to sleep, and I did.

When I came to, it was no longer night. Artificial white light buzzed above me.

The first thing I felt was something wet oozing down my chin.

Then… cool porcelain pressed against my cheek.

I was in a bathroom stall, my head stuck down a toilet bowl.

But it was different from waking up hungover.

I felt... filthy.

My body was aching, a striking pain rippling across the back of my head. 

When I lifted my neck slightly, a snapping sound made me jump, like my bones were popping back into place. 

My memory was gone, my thoughts a whirlwind lost to the dark. I could still see Elle's face illuminated in that startling light.

The shadowy horde around me, starry eyes burning into me.

Then there was nothing.

The familiar ice-cold graze of porcelain greeted me when I pried my eyes open.

There was something in my mouth, and I spat it out, expecting stale barf. What I wasn’t expecting was a wet piece of flesh to splash down into the bowl.

It took me several seconds to realize the toilet bowl I had my head down was not empty.

In the flickering light from the broken fixture above me, I saw the glistening red first, spattered on the lid, and when I looked down, on the floor too, staining my knees.

And then I saw all of it. The bulging, slimy red mess sticking from the bowl.

I lurched back, and something was stuck at the back of my throat.

I reached into my mouth, cringing, and pulled out what looked like a mauled finger, skinned of flesh. 

There were only spiky pieces of bone fragments clinging to shredded muscle.

Something inhuman croaked from my lips, and I slammed my hands over my mouth, my gut twisting.

I looked up.

Red.

I looked down.

More red.

Vivid, wet, and recent.

I was covered in dirt and grass stains, my legs bloodied and bruised, half of my hair ripped out.

The walls around me were the same shade, glistening, pooling, disgusting red, dripping and staining every surface.

The lumpy red mass sticking from the toilet bowl suddenly looked less like a mass the more I was looking at it, blinking through the blinding light.

At some point, I screamed, heaving up the rest, wet globules of fat spilling from my mouth. There was a head in the toilet bowl, stuck right under, like I had been trying to hide the evidence.

The head didn’t look like a head, half of its skull crushed. But I could still make out familiar features. Eyes still wide open, lips frozen in what looked like a scream.

The rest of her had presumably been flushed, but I could still see pieces of her clinging to the rim of the toilet.

Elle. 

Oh god, fuck, I killed my best friend. 

I'm still sitting here. I can't bring myself to move. Normal college life still goes on outside, and I can't understand how. 

I found myself back at the Gemini house a few hours ago. It was locked, but there was a small key wrapped in some paper. 

**I was FORCED to give you this, Oliver. Don't touch my stuff. You're sharing with Elena. Don't think this means any of us trust you. Welcome to the madhouse.**

“Coming in?”

The voice startled me. 

I twisted around, and there he was, the asshole Gemini. 

I took pleasure in walking away, dumping both the key and the note in the trash. 

I ask this as a Gemini. 

Preferably on campus, but this goes for all of you. 

Did any of you kill and eat someone last night with no memory of doing so? 

I'm starting to think the Gemini constellation is something more than a group of stars after all.

We didn’t interact much outside of work, so I never thought much of it and didn’t expect him to be interested in me.

He started texting me here and there, asking about my new job and just sending random messages. I thought it was just a friendly way to keep in touch. One time, he asked if I wanted to meet for coffee, and I agreed. During the conversation, we talked about food, and he mentioned that he likes to date girls from my ethnic background. I didn’t think anything of it - I just laughed and didn’t respond.

A few days later, I reached out and told him I was going to try the restaurant he recommended (we haven't met for coffee yet). He responded with more food talk, then said he knows another great place and would love to take me there. I agreed, thinking he was just offering like how other colleagues sometimes ask to meet for lunch to catch up. I didn’t think he was asking me out.

Then, right after I agreed, he asked if I was in a relationship, saying he wanted to make sure he wasn’t overstepping. For some reason, that made me nervous! I flustered and, without thinking, replied, “No, I’m not seeing anyone, and I don’t mind meeting up for food sometime, but this is just a regular hangout, right?” He said yes, just wanted to check, and then the conversation ended.

It didn’t hit me until later that he was actually asking me out! I got nervous because I didn’t realize he was interested in me, and I’m just not good at talking to guys - I’m super introverted. After thinking it over, I realized he seems like a decent guy, and I probably came off as not interested.

It’s been three weeks now, and this has been on my mind. From a guy’s perspective, would it be a good idea for me to text him and apologize for how I answered and explain that I flustered because I was surprised? Or is it better to just leave it and move on? I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable.

TL;DR:
I accidentally rejected a guy I like. He asked me out, but I didn’t realize he was interested and got nervous when he asked if I was in a relationship. I flustered and responded in a way that might’ve made him think I wasn’t interested. It’s been 3 weeks, and I’m wondering if I should apologize and explain I was surprised, or just leave it alone.",1,1756089081.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Welcome to r/Borderlands4! Feel free to ask questions, make posts, and just hang out. We want to be welcoming to newcomers, and vault hunters who have been off exploring other lands while we faithful have been anxiously waiting.

We are less that 20 days away from release! [Thanks for the count down](https://www.reddit.com/user/UpwardSpiral00/), u/UpwardSpiral00! They have done a great job keeping the community updated and their posts have become my favorite part of my morning coffee routine. The character trailers have also been an absolute joy to watch, and the excitement is starting to feel real! And to answer the burning question: I will play as all 4 (6?) vault hunters, but I will start with a gun based Rafa build.

**Topics -** ***in this essay I will discuss...***

For the fun part first! We have been talking as a mod team about what we want the direction of the subreddit, and would love some feedback. Since the Gearbox forums have met the [happy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/w3q1za/gearbox_forums_are_shutting_down/) [dagger](https://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-quotes/o-happy-dagger), and so we have decided that we will try to step in. As some of you may remember from Ye Ole Borderlands 3 release days, we will try to sticky hot fixes, patches and Big Discussion Topic posts. For the more controversial ones, one of the mods will use their account. This is for really two reasons a) easier to edit the post discussion box, and b) we get a wee notification on all the comments, and we can remove anything that breaks the side bar. Please do not get upset if we remove your post. It is to keep the subreddit from being 15 individual posts of ""why does x suck/is awesome/whatever"". If you made an excellent post, it will either get linked in a pinned comment, or added in the body of the discussion.

First idea, is a weekly sticky post for LFG that goes live from Thursday until Sunday. While the [Borderlands Discord](https://discord.gg/borderlands) offers this service, we would also like to offer this here too. This will be set up via an automated account. Much like the ratings on the back of your video games state, we will not be responsible for interactions with other people. Please do not tell us that x user was mean, it isn't that we don't care, but it is that we cannot verify this. Also, this could be the place that allows you to skirt a certain rule...the one after 2, and before 4 maybe??

The second is to take a bit more of a positive relationship with creators. We are still not going to allow the posts spamming of ""follow me on Twitch, I am xXborderlandsman69Xx"". But we think that we might try out a Monday only (ends at 11:59 pm eastern) place for creators to post their streams, or videos. There are a lot of fun borderlands creators out there, and this could be a fun way to find some new ones. This will also keep random people from posting ""I am live on twitch"" on here.

We will probably do a questions thread now that we can have up to 6 different posts stickied!!  Details to follow on the first thread.  Eventually.

**Onto the Not So Fun Stuff- Rules and reminders.**

SPOILERS- *As seen in Fast and the Furious, Nekrotafeyo Drift*

We will have a story discussion thread.  We will have a spoilers discussion thread.  Please do not post spoilers.  Use the spoiler tag.  If you do not know how to do it, please look [here](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=how+to+post+spoilers+on+reddit+youtube+video+2025&mid=2C1074FD8FA7144C51812C1074FD8FA7144C5181&FORM=VIRE).  Thanks!  This will be met with bans! until one month after release.  We will have a reminder set.

*Rules- not meant to be broken*

Please take a gander at the side bar. Please be civil. This is the number one rule that is broken. If you wouldn't say it in front of your mother, don't say it here. If someone calls you a name, report it and move on and DO NOT ENGAGE. You will not win an argument with a troll.  Also, arguments that are bunch of comments long just get deleted.  (Thats a lot of words, I ain't readin that)

Under this rule of being civil, please be nice to new people asking ""dumb"" questions in a post.  Being nice to those people help grow the community. (literally got started in the community a billion years asking for help with my over leveled UVHM Axton.)

Please note that any hate speech will NOT be tolerated.  This is against any creed, race, sexual orientation, etc.  This will be an instant ban.  I think this is self-explanatory.  This includes each other, CHARACTERS and people in the community.  Please note that threats of violence are included in this.

Please do not spam.  Making new accounts to get around these rules is against reddit wide rules. Reddit will IP ban you. If you see a sticky thread related to the post you had, please click on that and post there.  If there seem to be lot of posts about a topic, shoot us a modmail, and we will assess.

Meme rule- please use official Borderlands 4 assets to make a meme.

Piracy- this is against the rules of this subreddit to discuss, talk about, or even state that you are going to ""wait to pirate"".  This is out of respect to the developers who sometimes drop into threads.  This isn't really up for debate, and has been a rule in the various Borderlands subreddits going back a decade.

**In Conclusion!** (much like Stephen King, I cannot write these)

We on the Mod Team are just fans of the game who wanted to engage with the community in a different way. We aren't getting paid by Gearbox.

We do want the subreddit to be a fun place to be on release.  We are excited to see the memes, the builds, and watch the community grow into a fun place.

Thanks!

Like... hold up. Is this legit? Or is it just another internet rabbit hole that's too bizarre to *not* check out? 

I went DEEP because, come on, everyone wants some easy side income, right? And here's what I found; buckle up, fam!

- **They claim you can get rich by doing ""App Testing Gateways.""**
- All you need to do is solve Captchas at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and voila! Instant money, supposedly.
- But is this actually a real side hustle... or some wild tech trap?

Here’s where it gets WEIRD:

- Most sites don’t EVEN PAY CASH—they offer “points.” Points?? What am I supposed to do with points? Trade them in at the Internet Arcade??
- Sometimes, these “gateways” demand you sign up for questionable subscriptions. 🙄
- At **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, they say APP TESTING lets you earn by simply clicking for a few minutes a day.

But—and I still can’t BELIEVE THIS—no one ever says how MUCH $$ you *really* take home.

Is this too good to be true? Or… are we just cynics and missing out on this untapped goldmine? 😳

Ready for the punchline? Some horror stories:
- Time wasted—HOURS of clicking Captchas, and nada in your PayPal.
- Hidden fees pop up the minute you try to cash out.
- Some apps want access to wayyyy too much of your personal info. Sketchy vibes, tbh.  
- A handful of users said they actually DID earn small change at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, but not enough to even buy a latte.

So here’s what blows my mind—the ecosystem behind “captcha jobs” is MASSIVE.
People everywhere are looking for micro-tasks that claim to pay (even pennies) for their attention. Most funnels and “gateways” are really just a lead-in to get your clicks or data.

Let’s settle this! Have YOU actually made money with Captcha Apps? Whether you went all-in at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, or tried another gateway, spill the tea! 

Here’s what I want to know: 
- Have you ever gotten a payout?
- Was it worth your time?
- Or did you just end up angrily clicking X and promising never again?

Leave your hot takes and suss stories below—seriously, the internet NEEDS to know if **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is a badge of scammy nonsense... or real passive income.

READY, SET, DEBUNK! 🔥

And yeah, I think I’ll be reading Captchas in my nightmares tonight… thanks, algorithm. 👀

1mzer2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mzer2r/aitah_for_being_mad_and_sleeping_on_the_couch/,Aitah for being mad and sleeping on the couch over dishes?,"I (30F) moved in with my fiance (31M) about 2 months ago. 

We had an agreement- he handles his cat, I handle my dog. We handle our own dishes, but if I cook for both of us- he does the dishes. 

I cook about 80% of his meals, he cooks his own breakfast most days and leaves the dirty pans and dishes on the stove and counter. 

He uses at least 3-5 cups and mugs a day, I use one, maybe 2 at most. 

I do 100% of the laundry- including picking his laundry up off the floor when we have perfectly good laundry hampers throught the house. If I don't do the laundry, he does his when he's completely out of work clothes or clean underwear. But it's only the bare minimum and it sits in the dryer for days where I either have to take it out and put it away or it's going to sit there in the way of being able to do my own laundry, or towels, or sheets....

Taking out trash has been about 50-50. He stacks things up on top of a trash bin that needs the bag taken out, but if I take it out and put it by the door, he'll take it out. 


But 3 days ago, we had an argument over dishes.  I washed dishes for the third time in a row- our LARGE sink completely filled, the stove with a bunch of pots and pans stacked on it, the counter had dishes stacked, cups with sludge from coffee or soda or sweet tea (i drink water.  Or black tea unsweetened. Thats it) 

Yeah, third time in a row isnt a big deal... except that the time before that, he only did half the sink and left the rest.... and the times he has actually washed the dishes, it takes days, dishes still have food on them because he rushes through and doesn't notice a glob of ketchup (he uses ketchup. I think its disgusting) . 

I told him I'm done being his mother. Im not asking him to do dishes anymore, I'm just skipping to doing them myself, but only cooking for myself, only doing my own laundry, and if I have to clean his dishes to have an empty sink, I'm not asking- I'm skipping straight over asking and going right to being pissed. 

Because he would sooner buy more dishes than clean them on his own and I don't want the roaches from our apartments dumpster having an all you can eat buffet in the sink. 

His excuse during our argument was that I don't soak dishes.  I do. Always have.  (Living on my own, I'd soak any dishes until after dinner then I'd tackle them all) this time, 75% of the dishes were his. Pans with globs of burnt food, bacon grease, dishes with ketchup and solidified previously melted cheese, cups with crusty coffee, sticky soda... every dish that was used by him had to be scrubbed with steel wool (so glad we don't have coated pots and pans) 

After I did the dishes, I went into our room, grabbed my pillow, a blanket, phone, charger, and bedside water bottle, and set up camp for the indefinite future on the couch. 

I didn't say anything, didn't yell. When he asked why, I just said ""dishes"". 

He says I'm ""blowing up over nothing out of nowhere"".

Sorry if this type of post isn’t allowed, mods feel free to remove it if so

I’ve been living in Maple Ridge for a few years but since I work remote and I also have a side business that’s all remote, I haven’t had the chance to meet many people

I’d love to get more involved in the community and make more friends

I’ve started to sign up for volunteering and such but those processes take some time, in the meantime I thought maybe I could meet some cool people through here! (If you need volunteers for anything lmk as well, perhaps there’d be a good fit there) 

I work in the tech industry (cybersecurity) and my side business is in the same domain. That’s definitely one of my passions

Aside from that I wrestle (love wrestling as well). I go to a wrestling club in Vancouver, happy to take you along if we become friends and that interests you. It’s a group of great/friendly guys and gals. Unfortunately, they’re just all far from me in Maple Ridge

I’m also on the spiritual side and meditate a lot so if you’re on that wavelength we’ll surely have a lot to talk about (I’m not affiliated with any religion/am not religious) 

Feel free to dm me or I could dm you. No pressure, let’s talk on chat first and if we click we can grab coffee or do some activity together :)
