She Keeps Talking About All the Bodies in the Basement... Part 2,"She was having a good morning, she knew my name, asked if I wanted coffee, even hummed some old song that I assumed had been playing on the kitchen radio for a few minutes. It felt like time folded in on itself, like I was a teenager again and nothing had changed. But the thing about dementia is that it's never linear. The memories come in waves, some real, some scrambled, and you never know what shore they'll wash up on. She was buttering toast when she paused, knife hovering over the bread, her eyes fixed on something far away. 

“They said he always came out at night,” she said softly. I looked up from my mug. 

“Who does?” She didn't answer right away, just stared through the window like she was for something to appear in the trees. 

“I heard it calling him…” She whispered “like a lullaby, sweet and sticky, and he followed it right into the dark”

 I didn't ask who he was. 

I didn't have to because I remembered.

2002 –

It was Friday night. The one right after school had let out. We had a tradition that summer, dragging sleeping bags and pillows out into Ty’s backyard and pretending we were roughing it even though the back porch lot was still in view and his mom let us use the bathroom inside. 

The whole crew was there, Josh, Cody, Ty, Jules. Alex , Bradley and me. 

We stayed up too late, roasting marshmallows over the fire pit, telling each other increasingly wild stories about what we thought was living in the basement of the Langley house. 

The creature had names, powers even a back story. We built it together out of fear and bravado, each of us trying to one up the last.

 I think we all knew it wasn't real until it was. 

That night I woke up around 2:00 AM, the kind of wake up that slaps you in the chest with no dream attached. 

I had to pee, so I slipped out of my sleeping bag and crept to the far end of the yard where the grass turned into woods. 

And that's when I saw it. 

At first I thought it was just shadows playing tricks on me, but then I heard it. A voice, not loud, not clear, more like a melody, humming gently and syrupy and wrong. 

I stepped closer to the fence, heart thudding. That's when I saw the boy. He couldn't have been more than 9 or 10. 

I didn't know him, not really, but I'd seen him around the trailer park.

 He was barefoot in a T-shirt too big for him, staring straight ahead like he was sleepwalking. 

He was following the voice. I watched, frozen, as he crossed the street. 

The yellow porch lights of Briarwood Lane, flickering like dying fireflies. 

And walked around to the side of the Langley house, right to the basement door, And standing just beside it was something else. 

I couldn't see its face, just the shape. Tall, slouched, like it didn't know how to wear its skin properly. One arm was too long, the other hung limp like it had been broken and never healed, and its head… it tilted to the side, twitching, watching the boy like he was a treat wrapped in tinfoil.

 The basement door creaked open. The boy disappeared inside. The thing followed him in. The door shut and I couldn't move. 

I don't remember falling asleep. 

I don't remember crawling back into my sleeping bag. But when I woke up, it was morning hot and bright and full of bees buzzing around the soda cans. 

And then the sirens started.

The police started searching for the boy early that morning.

 So we decided to roll up to the sheriff's station like we were on a mission from God. 

Bikes squealing, backpacks bouncing, Ty nearly crashing into the curb like an idiot. 

“Watch it, Jackass!” Alex barked, swerving around him. 

“It's the brakes, OK?” Ty said, hopping off and letting his bike thud to the sidewalk.

 “I told my mom to fix them.”

“You also told us your cousin was in Blink 182,” Jules muttered, pushing open the front door. 

Inside, the air was cold and smelled like stale coffee and whatever was rotting in the vending machine.

 Sheriff Barnes sat behind the counter, half the chicken biscuit in his hand and the other half in his mustache. 

He looked up with a grunt. “And what the hell is this?”

 Josh stepped forward; chest puffed out like he thought he was in an action movie. 

“We need to file a report…”

 Barnes raised an eyebrow. “A report?”

“ Yeah,” Ty said. “A missing kid report. You know, like for a kid that's missing.”

The sheriff dropped the biscuit on a napkin and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

 “Jesus Christ, it's not even ten yet.”

“Doesn't make the kid less missing,” Jules said. 

“I saw him,” I said quickly, stepping in before things went completely sideways. 

“Last night, he was going into the Langley house.”

 Barnes froze. 

Bradley shuffled his feet beside me, quiet as ever. 

“It was like, like something was leading him.”

 The room went quiet for a second, then Cody broke the silence. 

“He means like a monster, but like the bad kind, not the cookie Monster kind,”

Barnes sighed.

 Like he just aged 10 years in five seconds. “A monster? You all see it?”

 “We didn't all see it,” Josh admitted, scratching at the side of his neck. 

But he did, and we believe him. 

Alex crossed her arms, “Because we're not morons. You think it's a coincidence another kid vanishes and it's always the same area?”

“It had long arms.” I said, staring at the worn-down patch on the desk.

 “One of them didn't move right, like it was broken and it was humming.”

 “humming?” Barnes echoed.

 “Like a song. I don't know,” I said. “Just this low creepy noise, like, like cicadas, but in a person's throat.”

 Cody mimicked it, “buzzing like a bug.”

 Alex slapped his shoulder, “not helping.”

 The sheriff stood slowly and walked around the counter.

 His belt creaked; badge glinted under the fluorescence. 

He looked at each of us like we were a row of rusted out bicycles. He was about to toss in the trash. 

“You kids been watching scary movies again?”

Jules rolled her eyes. “Oh my God”

“maybe one with a spooky house. Monsters in the dark,” Barnes added. “Maybe aliens?”

 “No, Sir,” Bradley said. “isn't a game.”

 Barnes let out a long sigh. “You want my advice? Go home, stay out of that damn house, and stop stirring up trouble while the whole town's already on edge.”

 “But I saw him,” I whispered, “the kid and that thing.”

 He stared at me for a long second, then turned around and headed back behind the desk.

 “Go. I don't want to see you back in here unless there's blood on your shoes and someone's actually dead.”

 “We could be dead next,” Josh muttered under his breath. 

Barnes didn't look up. “Then I guess I'll finally have peace and quiet around here.”

 We filed out slowly, defeated, the bell above the door jingling behind us. 

Outside, the sun was brutal, already baking the pavement hot enough to fry your soles. 

“Great,” Ty muttered, kicking at a crack in the sidewalk,  “That went well.”

 “He thinks we're making it up,” I said. 

“Of course he does,” Jules replied. “Because we're kids. Because if we said we saw a possum and a Tutu, he believed that before Monster and a murder house.”

 Josh spat in the dirt. “Screw it, we'll handle it ourselves.”

 “We are not handling it ourselves,” Bradley said, eyes wide. “It's literally a killing kids.”

 Alex snorted. “So what, we just sit on our asses while it picks off kids like Pokémon cards?”

 “No,” I said. Turning toward the end of the block, where the Langley house sat like a scab on the neighborhood. 

“We're not sitting. We're watching, waiting.”

 “If nobody else is going to stop this thing, then we will.” Josh finished. 

“Because that's what idiots do.” Cody grinned. “And we're the biggest idiots around.”

It was almost 1:00 AM when I checked on her. The house was quiet, too quiet, like the air had been sucked out of it. 

I patted softly to her door, my footsteps muffled by the old carpet. 

Her night light glowed faintly beside the dresser, casting warped shadows across the walls. 

She was curled in bed, barely more than a silhouette beneath the quilt my grandma made. 

Her breathing was shallow but steady, lips moving just slightly. 

“Mom.” I whispered, stepping closer. She didn't answer, 

but then, barely audible, she mumbled something slurred. 

Like a dream trying to breakthrough sleep,

“The boy. Didn't scream,” she whispered. “Just walked down like the others.” 

A chill ran up my spine. I sat beside her bed and gently brushed the hair from her forehead. Her skin was cool, soft as paper. 

“I miss you,” I whispered. Her eyes fluttered, and for just a second it felt like she was looking right at me, really seeing me. 

Then her gaze drifted past me again, unfocused. Just like that, she was gone again…

2002 –

The plan was simple. We'd camp out in Jules backyard, where the fence had just enough of a gap to slip out if we needed. From there, we'd sneak around to the wooded hill behind the Langley house and keep watch. No flashlights, no talking, just eyes on the windows. 

Ty brought Pop Rocks and a can a Surge like he was preparing for a sugar fueled war. 

Alex had a Polaroid camera she swore could capture Ghost. 

Josh brought binoculars. 

Cody wore his ninja turtle pajamas for stealth and nobody had the heart to tell him otherwise.

 Bradley sat beside me in the grass. He didn't say much at first, he rarely did. But he handed me half melted Charleston Chew from his hoodie pocket and smiled. 

“You still like these?” He asked. 

I grinned. “Only when I get them free.” He chuckled, eyes twinkling in the moonlight. 

“Same.”

 Time dragged, the stars blinked overhead, and the woods were alive with cricket noise and the occasional distant owl. 

We passed around a bag of Doritos, whispering theories. 

“OK.” Cody said, licking orange dust off his fingers. “What if it's not a monster, but like, an alien?”

 “Like one of those Gray dudes.”

 “Aliens don't hum like cicadas,” Ty whispered.

“That's like science.”

 “Oh, yeah, you majoring in bug sounds at Harvard?” Alex snapped, earning a giggle from Jules. 

I leaned back in the grass, shoulder brushing Bradley’s. He didn't move away for a long minute.

 We just laid there in the dark, watching the Langley house like it was going to blink. 

“I keep thinking about that kid,” I said softly, only loud enough for Bradley to hear. 

“The one I saw, the way he walked like he wanted to go.” Bradley looked over at me. 

“You think it messes with your head?”

 “I think it already is.” 

He was quiet for a second, then he shifted slightly, his hand brushing mine, not by accident. “You're brave,” he said.

I swallowed. “You're the only one who ever says that.”

 “I mean it.”

 My heart thudded like a drum. The world felt so still. I turned toward him. 

We were close now, so close I could feel his breath.

 I didn't know if it was the night, the fear, the sweet smell of Charleston Chew between us, but I leaned in. 

So did he. 

We were about to kiss when…

 “Ahem.” 

We both jumped. 

Scrambling apart, Alex stood behind us, arms crossed, eyebrows raised. 

She didn't look mad, just amused. 

“Sorry,” she said. “Didn't mean to interrupt your romantic stakeout.” 

Bradley was red in the face. 

“We were just.” She waved it off, “relaxed. Romeo, I'm not your mom.” 

I looked at her, unsure what to say. She smiled softly, crouching beside me. 

“You're good, you know. Both of you,”

 “what do you mean?”

 “I mean, it's OK to like someone even if it's not who other people expect.”

 I blinked.

 “You're not going to tell the others?” She snorted. 

“Please, like I care what Josh thinks.” 

Bradley let out a quiet laugh. Alex patted my shoulder. 

“Don't worry dude, your secret crush is safe with me.”

 Before I could thank her, Jules hissed from the other side of the clearing

 “guys window. Look!”

 We scrambled into position, ducking low in the tall grass. 

The second story window of the Langley house was glowing faintly. No lamp, no TV, just that eerie, flickering yellow. 

Something moved behind the glass. It wasn't a person. It was too tall, too thin. 

Its body jerking like a puppet in water, the sound started again. 

Low, vibrating almost inside our skulls. 

That humming the same sound I heard that night with the boy. Bradley grabbed my hand. 

This time I didn't let go.  

We watched it lurch across the 2nd floor, long limbs dangling at its sides, head to low like it was sniffing for something. 

Then it was gone. 

The light snapped off, and for a moment we were frozen, 

Josh whispered. “What the hell was that?” 

Ty clutched his arm. “Dude, it's real. I told you it's real.”

 “Shut up,” Alex hissed. “Look by the back door.” 

A shape emerged from the Langley house, tall and hunched, gliding across the back yard. 

Without a sound, even the wind seemed to hold its breath. It was heading towards the woods. 

No one said a word. We all just moved, crawling, crouching, cutting through Jules backyard and slipping under the fence gap like shadows. 

The woods were damp and heavy with the smell of pine and stagnant air, our shoes, crunched twigs and soggy leaves. Fireflies blinked in the distance, but it felt like even they were keeping their distance from what we were chasing. 

We followed the thing quietly, terrified but not stopping. Bradley stayed close to me, breathing fast. 

I could feel the tension in him, every step forward a silent dare. 

“Do you see it?” Cody whispered, squinting into the dark there. Alex pointed through the trees, down a hill through the clearing was a lake. 

Not the nice kind where people fish or skip rocks.

 This was the forgotten kind. 

Marky still surrounded by cat tails and gnats. 

A patch of moonlight skimmed the surface, turning it into a silver bruise. The creature was there, kneeling by the water's edge, its back to us. 

It was doing something with its hands. Digging, washing. 

We crept closer, barely breathing. It dipped something into the water, something that made a wet slapping sound, something soft.

 And then it stood up, turned its head. 

We dropped to the ground instantly. 

Ty was shaking beside me, “Don't move. Don't even blink.”

 The thing paused, then melted back into the woods, vanishing between the trees. 

None of us said anything for a full minute, then Alex stood slowly, “We have to see what it was doing. 

“No way,” Josh muttered, “I'm not getting eaten by Slender Man's cousin.” 

“We came this far,” she snapped.

 “What if someone's hurt” 

that did it.

 One by one, we got to our feet and walked toward the edge of the lake, our flashlights off, only moonlight and fear guiding our steps. 

The first thing I noticed was the smell. 

Rot. 

An iron and pond scum. 

And then we saw it.

 Half submerged in the reeds.

 Torn open like a gutted deer. 

It was a boy, the one I saw, the one I tried to forget. 

His shirt was the same blue with yellow sleeves now soaked and stained. 

His mouth was open, eyes wide. 

His skin looked chewed. I backed away, bile rising in my throat.

 Jules screamed. 

Cody started crying. Josh just stood there whispering, “no, no, no, no, no.”

 Bradley grabbed my shoulder, pulling me back, “We need to go.”

 “we have to tell someone,” Alex said, her voice shaking. 

“We did tell someone,” I muttered “and he didn't believe us.”

 “Then we make him. We'll go to Sheriff Barnes in the morning,” Ty said. “Bring him here.” 

“We can't wait,” I said. 

“What if it moves him or eats him?” Cody whimpered.

 “We'll all go together,” Alex said. 

“He can't ignore all of us.” 

I looked down at the body one last time, and then up at the trees, at the dark. It was still out there, watching, waiting.

Present day –

It was just after 10:00 AM when I stepped into her room. 

The curtains were drawn halfway, letting in that soft milky light that always made the dust look like snow. 

My mom was lying on her side, facing the window. 

Her breathing was slow, shallow, peaceful For once. 

I sat on the edge of the bed and brushed a strand of hair from her cheek. 

“Hey, Mom,” I said gently. She didn't answer. Sometimes she didn't. Other times, the things she said stuck in me like splinters. 

I reached for the bottle of pills on her night stand and started sorting out her dosage on the Monday morning compartment. Behind me, I heard her voice, soft, barely audible. 

“He still hungry,” She mumbled. 

I froze.

 Her eyes were still closed. “Who, Mom?” I whispered. “Who's hungry?” 

She didn't answer, just sighed and curled slightly tighter under her blanket like a child.

 I left the room with my heart pounding because I know exactly what she meant.

2002-

We met in Ty’s backyard just past the broken swing set and the plastic kiddie pool full of sand. 

Everyone was buzzing, tense.

 We hadn't slept after what we saw. 

Bradley paced like he was on trial. Alex had her arms crossed tight, jaw set like stone. 

Josh kept checking his watch even though it wasn't working. 

Jules hugged herself, eyes darting between the trees. 

“Where's Cody?”

 “He said he was coming to” 

 “he probably overslept.”

 “He's never late,” Bradley said. “Not when it's important.”

 Josh waved it off. “He's probably raiding the pantry again. Let's just go.”

 “We should wait.” I said “we shouldn't split up.”

 But the others were already walking. 

We headed toward town, cutting across the empty lot behind the gas station, past the sun, faded soda machines and the cluster of crows on the power lines that always seemed to be watching. 

Sheriff Barnes office was on main two doors down from the diner and just across from the old movie rental place. His cruiser was out front, lights off. 

The door creaked when we stepped inside. Sheriff Barnes looked up from behind his desk, eyes tired and lined. Like cracked leather. He raised an eyebrow. 

“What now?”

 Alex stepped forward; shoulders squared. “We saw it. The thing that's been taking the boys.”

 “We saw it near the lake last night.”

 Barnes exhaled slowly. 

“Alex…”

 “I'm not joking. We saw it, and we found…” she swallowed. “We found the body. Another kid by the lake.”

 He stared at her for a beat, then leaned back in his chair.

 “You kids have no idea what kind of trouble this could stir up.”

 “We're telling the truth.” I said “we wouldn't come here unless…”

 the phone on his desk rang.

 Barnes picked it up, muttered a few words, then paused. 

His face went pale. 

His grip on the receiver tightened

“when” he asked. 

Another pause, then he hung up. 

He stood slowly. 

“What's wrong?” Jules asked. 

The sheriff looked at us. 

“Cody Mendez,” He said “his mom just called. He never came home last night.”

 The world seemed to tilt between our feet. 

“No,” Bradley whispered. “No, he was just with us.”

 “He said he'd meet us,” Jules said, voice trembling. 

Barnes grabbed his hat and keys. 

“Get home, all of you. Now, this isn't a game anymore.”

 But we didn't move, because we already knew what he didn't. It had taken Cody too and now we were next…

We didn’t go home.

We scattered for show, ducked around the corner, and regrouped behind the Family Dollar.

Bradley’s eyes were red, fists clenched so tight his knuckles had gone white.

“He’s not gone,” he said. “He’s not. Not until we see.”

“We don’t even know where they’re looking,” Alex said, her voice low. “Sheriff said to go home. He’ll just write us off again.”

“I got the walkies,” Ty said, holding up a pair of chunky black radios with duct tape on the sides. “One’s on their channel. My brother used to work security—left it behind when he moved. Still works.”

We all exchanged looks.

No one said no.

Ty handed one to Josh and clipped the other to his belt, flicking it on. Static hissed, then a voice crackled through.

“…deputy says they’re moving search efforts toward Ridge Quarry. Dogs caught a scent trail.”

“Quarry,” I whispered. My stomach dropped.

“That’s where they found the shoe,” Jules said. “Last week. By the fence.”

We moved fast—cutting through the brush behind the baseball field, then through the drainage tunnel beneath the highway. The summer sun was still heavy, but everything felt darker somehow.

By the time we got to the top of the quarry ridge, the police were already there.

We crouched low in the trees, hidden in the scrub, hearts hammering.

Sheriff Barnes stood near the edge of the water, his arms crossed, lips pressed into a grim line. A couple of deputies were knee-deep in the water, guiding something toward the shore.

“No,” Bradley whispered.

The shape was small. Lifeless.

A pair of red sneakers we all recognized.

Cody.

His body was bloated, his arms twisted strangely, like he’d been thrown or dropped from a height. His face was… wrong. Bruised. Pale. One of the deputies covered it with a towel almost immediately.

Jules turned and buried her face in Alex’s shoulder, sobbing.

Ty dropped the walkie. The static hissed into the silence like a funeral dirge.

We stayed there, frozen. Watching them pull our friend from the quarry like a forgotten doll.

Sheriff Barnes rubbed a hand over his mouth. He looked wrecked. Not surprised. Just tired. Like someone who'd known this was coming all along.

I felt something splinter inside me.

This wasn’t a game.

Cody was dead.

It was real. It was hunting us.

And it wasn’t finished.

We didn’t speak as we walked back through the woods. It wasn’t the same silence as before. This one sat heavier, like wet clothes sticking to your skin. Like grief had shape and weight and could follow you home.

When we reached the clearing behind Ty’s trailer, we stopped.

No one moved.

Jules stepped forward and turned to face us. Her eyes were puffy, her voice raw.

“I can’t do this,” she whispered. “Cody’s dead. You saw him. And we’re just kids, okay? We’re not detectives. We’re not… heroes in some movie.”

Bradley started to say something, but she cut him off.

“We could be next.”

No one disagreed. Because she wasn’t wrong.

“We *have* to figure out what’s doing this,” I said. “We *know* it’s not an animal. We *know* something’s out there, and Sheriff Barnes won’t listen to us. If we don’t do something, who’s next? Ty? Jules? One of *us*?”

“I’m sorry,” Jules said, her voice shaking. “I just want it to stop.”

Then she turned and walked away, disappearing down the hill toward her house. We didn’t follow.

Alex looked down at the dirt. “I don’t blame her.”

Bradley ran a hand through his hair. “We need a plan.”

Ty nodded. “Tomorrow. Meet at my place. Noon.”

We all agreed. Quietly. Somberly. It didn’t feel brave. It felt desperate.

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

**Present Day-**

The attic was hotter than I remembered.

I came up here to look for the box of old summer clothes but got sidetracked by the smell of mothballs and old cardboard. The past has a smell, and up here it clung to everything.

That's when I saw it—an old plastic crate with peeling Ninja Turtles stickers on the side.

I opened it without thinking.

Inside were relics from a different world: a scratched *Spider-Man* VHS, a cracked yo-yo, a walkie talkie with the duct tape still on the antenna… and a folded sheet of red paper.

I picked it up slowly. It was faded, creased. My throat tightened as I realized what it was.

A flyer.

**MISSING – CODY SUTTON**  
Last seen July 15, 2002 – Age 13 – Red sneakers

I stared at it for a long time.

And then something under the flyer caught my eye—a Polaroid.

It was blurry, the edges browned from age. But there we were. All of us. Me, Ty, Bradley, Alex, Jules, Josh… and Cody. We were all standing in front of Ty’s trailer, Cody’s arm around my shoulder, his grin toothy and wide.

My chest ached.

And then I remembered the next part.

The night after the quarry, I couldn’t sleep. I’d gone out to the back porch to get some air… and that’s when I saw it again.

The thing. The creature. Watching from the trees.

Only that time—it waved.

Ty’s front yard looked like a war room—spread-out bike helmets, empty slushie cups, and a wrinkled road map of Briarwood Lane weighed down with rocks. We’d been waiting almost half an hour before anyone said what we were all thinking.

“She’s not coming,” Alex muttered, kicking at a stick.

“Jules is just scared,” Bradley said. “We all are.”

“I say we go to her house,” I said. “She deserves to say no to our faces.”

Ty frowned but nodded. “Yeah. Let's go.”

It wasn’t far. Everything in Briarwood Lane was within biking distance. The ride was short and quiet, the only sounds the click of gears and tires on gravel.

Jules lived in a small blue house near the end of Cedar Ridge, where the street dipped and the trees grew taller. Her older sister Savannah answered the door, leaning on the frame like she already knew why we were there. She was sixteen and didn’t hang with us, but everyone knew who she was—varsity cheer, way too cool, and the girl all the boys crushed on but were too scared to talk to.

Except Cody. He used to call her ""Vanna Banana"" just to piss her off.

Her smile faded when she saw our faces. “I heard,” she said softly. “About Cody.”

Bradley nodded. “We need to talk to Jules.”

Savannah hesitated, then stepped aside. “She’s in her room. Hasn’t really come out.”

The five of us stepped inside. It smelled like hairspray and vanilla lotion, the fan in the hallway humming a soft drone. Savannah led us to the door at the end of the hall and knocked gently.

“Jules,” she said, “your little friends are here.”

No answer.

“Come on,” Savannah said, not unkindly. “They came all this way, and they look like hell.”

Still silence.

“I know you’re scared,” she added, “but you’ve always been the brave one. You were the one who climbed the water tower first. You were the one who made me walk you to the Langley place when you were ten just to *spit* on the porch.”

Something shuffled inside. The door cracked open.

Jules stood there, eyes red, but her shoulders squared. “This doesn’t mean I want to go,” she said, looking at me.

“I’m not asking you to,” I said. “But I am asking you to help us stop this… for Cody.”

Jules looked past us, then up at Savannah. “Will you come?”

Savannah blinked. “Me?”

“You always said I should stop being scared of things that go bump in the night,” Jules said. “So let’s go see what’s making all the noise.”

Savannah looked surprised—but then she smiled.

“Fine,” she said. “But I’m not walking through the woods in flip flops.”

That night, Mom made spaghetti. The sauce was from a jar, the noodles a little too soft, but I didn’t care. We ate on the couch, plates balanced on paper towels instead of real napkins, the TV casting a bluish glow across the room. *Back to the Future* was on cable, and she quoted every line like it was scripture.

“You’re gonna see some serious shit,” she said with a grin, pointing at the screen just before the DeLorean took off. “Classic.”

I laughed, even though she’d said that same thing every time we watched it.

After dinner, she ran her fingers through my hair. “You okay?” she asked.

I shrugged. “Yeah.”

She studied me for a moment. “You’ve been quiet lately.”

“It’s just… stuff with the guys. Weird summer.”

“You’re thirteen. It’s supposed to be weird.”

“I guess.”

She nudged me. “Hey. I know this house gets creepy sometimes. Especially at night. But you’re safe here, alright?”

“I know.”

“You promise me something?”

“Yeah?”

“Don’t go chasing shadows just because the world feels dark. Not everything strange is worth finding.”

It was such a weird thing to say at the time, I didn’t think much of it. But now… now I wonder if she already knew something. Something I didn’t.

The plan was simple: wait until she was asleep, sneak out the back door, and meet the others by the edge of Briarwood Lane. Ty had a flashlight. Josh brought the gloves. I brought nerves and a stomach full of half-digested spaghetti.

We met up under the busted old streetlight at the edge of the woods.

“You sure about this?” Alex asked. She had her hair tied back, and she looked serious, like she was going to war.

“I need to see it,” I said. “We all do.”

The Langley house loomed in the distance, half-hidden behind tall grass and overgrown trees. Its windows were still boarded up, the paint still peeling, the silence around it so deep it almost hurt to breathe.

Savannah, Jules, and Bradley hung back by the fence line, crouched behind some shrubs.

“We’ll keep watch,” Savannah whispered. “Yell if anything happens.”

The four of us—me, Ty, Josh, and Alex—crept along the side of the house. That’s when we saw it: a narrow opening along the bottom of the foundation, just big enough to crawl through.

“Think it goes under the whole place?” Ty asked.

“Only one way to find out,” Alex said, already getting on her hands and knees.

Josh groaned. “God, it smells like mildew and rat piss.”

“Shut up and move,” Alex hissed.

We crawled one by one under the house, the dirt cold against our palms. Cobwebs clung to our faces, and something skittered past Josh’s hand, making him curse under his breath. The beams above our heads were low and rotting, but we kept moving.

After what felt like forever, the crawlspace opened up into a dark, empty room. The air changed—colder, like something lived here that wasn’t supposed to.

Ty’s flashlight flicked around the space.

There was a rusted furnace, a few crumpled beer cans, and something else—scratches along the floorboards, deep ones, like someone had been dragged.

“I don’t like this,” Josh whispered.

“We’re already in,” I said. “Might as well keep going.”

We hadn’t even realized it yet.

We weren’t alone.

Inside the Langley House  
The air was thick and musty. It smelled like mold, rot, and something else—something sour, metallic. Like blood that had dried and gone sticky in the heat.

Ty’s flashlight cut through the gloom as we stepped out of the crawlspace and into what must’ve once been a basement storage room.

There was a mattress in the corner, yellowed with age and stained in places I didn’t want to think about. Torn clothing was piled nearby—little shirts, socks, a shoe with a cartoon character printed on the side. A cracked baby monitor sat on a shelf, its red light still flickering faintly.

Josh picked something up and turned pale. “Dude... this is a library card. For Trevor Hill.”

Alex turned her light toward the wall. “Guys…”

Scratched into the wood, over and over again, were the words:  
**“MAKE IT QUIET. MAKE IT STOP. MAKE IT QUIET. MAKE IT STOP.”**

We were all frozen, breathing heavy, hearts pounding.

“I don’t think we’re alone,” I said.

And then—*creak.*

We all whipped around. Ty had wandered toward the stairwell.

“Ty,” Alex whispered. “What are you doing?!”

He turned back, shrugging. “We gotta know where it goes. Maybe it leads up into the—”

A blur. A noise like a shriek and a hiss mashed together.

Then Ty was gone—ripped off his feet by something dark and massive at the top of the stairs. He screamed as it dragged him halfway up the steps, flailing.

“TY!” Josh yelled, lunging forward.

There was another horrible sound—bones crunching, wood snapping—and then Ty *fell.* Straight over the stairwell railing, landing hard on a broken beam jutting up from a pile of debris below. He didn’t scream again. Just gasped.

“Shit—shit—he’s impaled—” I choked out.

Josh and I were at his side in seconds. Blood was bubbling from Ty’s mouth, and his eyes were wide with pain, but he was alive.

Alex shined the light up the stairs. The *thing* was still there, crouched in the shadows. Its eyes glowed faintly—reflecting back like a cat’s, but wrong. Too high. Too human.

“We gotta go NOW,” I shouted.

Josh nodded, grabbing Ty’s shoulders while I grabbed his legs. He was heavy and slick with blood. We half-dragged, half-carried him back toward the crawlspace, our hearts jackhammering.

The creature shrieked again and came pounding down the stairs—too fast, too loud, limbs hitting the walls like a spider made of meat and nightmares.

“FASTER!” Alex screamed, holding the flashlight behind us to try and blind it.

We shoved Ty through the crawlspace first. He groaned, the piece of wood still stuck in his gut. Josh followed, pushing him, then Alex.

I was last.

I turned back just once—and it was *right there.* Not five feet away. Crawling fast, its limbs bending the wrong way, mouth too wide, eyes too dark. I scrambled backward through the dirt as it slammed into the crawlspace entrance, clawing, snarling—but it was too big to fit.

It screamed like it was *frustrated.* Like it knew it missed its chance.

We didn’t stop until we were clear of the house, dragging Ty through the brush, all of us bloody and shaking. Savannah and Jules were already running toward us when they saw us burst out from under the porch.

“What the hell happened?!” Savannah shouted.

Alex fell to her knees. “It was real. It’s *real.*”

Bradley ripped off his shirt and pressed it against Ty’s wound. “He needs a hospital—*now.*”

Jules was pale, frozen in place.

We all were.

Because none of us could deny it anymore.

There was something evil in the Langley house.

Present Day-

My hands were trembling. I hadn’t thought about that night in years—maybe I hadn’t *let* myself. The way Ty screamed, the weight of his body as we dragged him out, the sound of that *thing* slamming into the crawlspace wall.

I closed my eyes for a moment. Let the silence settle. Let my heart slow.

Then I reached for my laptop and opened Facebook.

The screen lit up, a quiet hum filling the room.

I didn’t even hesitate. I typed his name:

**Tyrell Carson.**

The page loaded.

There he was.

Profile picture from maybe last year—older, beard now, heavier, a deep scar just visible along the side of his neck. But still him. Still Ty.

My chest tightened.

He had a wife, two kids, a life. Posts about barbecue Sundays, a little girl in dance class, a “Happy 10 years” post from his anniversary.

I stared at the screen for a long time before clicking *Add Friend.*

The request sent.

A strange, aching calm settled over me.

I closed the laptop gently, careful like I was putting away something fragile.

Then I stood, shut off the light, and walked down the hall to my bedroom.

Mom was already asleep. I paused at her door, listened to the gentle rhythm of her breathing, and then moved on.

My bed creaked as I climbed in, the ceiling fan spinning lazily above me. The night outside was thick and quiet, the way it always is when something’s waiting just out of sight.

I stared up at the ceiling and whispered to myself, “You were the last one, weren’t you?”

Then I closed my eyes and let the dark take me.

It started with the sound of cicadas.

Not soft or distant like usual—but loud, *screaming*, like they were inside my ears. Inside the *walls*. The night pulsed with them.

In the dream, I was back under the house again, knees scraped raw from crawling across splintered wood and dirt. I could see the glow of Ty’s flashlight ahead, bouncing with each breath.

Then it flickered. Went out.

Something moved behind me.

I turned, and the crawlspace wasn’t a crawlspace anymore. It was endless. A long, yawning tunnel of wet breathing shadows. And from the dark, something with fingers like antlers and a mouth of teeth *too wide* crawled forward—

“You forgot about me?”

I woke up gasping, drenched in sweat. The ceiling fan spun lazily above, like it hadn’t just watched a monster lean over me in the dark.

I sat up. Rubbed my face. The house was quiet—too quiet. No humming from the baby monitor I kept near Mom’s room. No rustle of her sheets. Just that creeping silence.

Something in me snapped alert.

I got up.

Walked barefoot down the hallway, the old hardwood cold beneath my feet. Her door was open.

“Mom?”

No answer.

The bed was empty.

Panic hit my chest like a punch.

I checked the bathroom, the kitchen, even the backyard. Nothing.

Then I saw it—just down the road, near the tree line, her figure in the pale orange wash of the streetlamp. Thin robe clutched tight, barefoot, her gray hair wild like seaweed in the wind.

I ran.

“Mom!”

She didn’t turn.

She kept walking, arms outstretched, muttering something too low to make out.

I reached her just as she stepped into the gravel shoulder.

She screamed.

“My son’s in there! He’s in there! It took him—oh god, it took my baby!”

“Mom, *stop*! It’s me!”

She fought me, weakly pushing at my chest, eyes wide and wet with terror. “He took him into the dark! It *pulled* him!”

“*Mom.*”

I grabbed her face, gently, firmly. Made her look at me.

“*I’m right here, okay? It’s me. I’m your son. I’m right here.***”**

For a second, she just stared.

Then her hands dropped, trembling.

Her lips quivered. “Oh… oh, sweetheart…” she whispered, her whole body deflating like a balloon losing air.

“I was so scared,” she said, softer now. “I heard you calling. I *heard* you.”

I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. “I know. But you’re safe now. Let’s go home.”

I wrapped an arm around her and walked her back down the road in the dark.

The stars above us didn’t blink. The wind didn’t blow. The night just watched us, quiet and still.

And in the silence, the cicadas hummed.",1,1750061753.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I always just do school event & portrait.,"I always be a second photographer for school & college event. I don't owned a camera at the time but I always take pictures when he feel tired. I primarily do portrait & group photo. 

Just a month ago my Step Father gift me a camera. My mom told him that I do photography at school & suggest that I take their wedding pictures. So I get myself Sony a6000 with 56mm F1.7 lens & a kits lens. Now that the wedding is past & I think I did a good job for my first time, I don't know what to do with my camera anymore. I currently unemployed taking care of my grandparents & waiting for my degree. So I'm not going anywhere. I live in rural area at a countryside & I do owned a car & motorcycle. 

I know apsc camera isn't anything special but I don't want it to waste in dry box been kept in storage. I watch YouTube video all just explaining to go & shoot a photo but as someone who only do portrait & event photography I find difficulty on doing other kind of photography. I always feel like my picture is not good & lacking. Since I finally owned a camera I want to make photography as a hobby of mine.

Another problem is that I can't even do portrait photography as I no longer in School or college. Most of my close friends are busy with part time job & I don't want to bother them. When we hangout I just coffee & talk so I don't think of bringing my camera. So I really don't have anyone as a subject to do portrait as well. 

I hope someone can help or give me some advice for what I can do with my camera as a hobby. Thank you for reading :)",0,1750061667.0,photography,0,0.5,False

They say the camera never lies—but I say it flirts, teases, and sometimes tells just the right kind of fib. I’m the guy behind the lens, chasing beauty in all its messy, unexpected glory. I live for those in-between moments—the smirk before the laugh, the glance that says everything, the kind of light that makes skin glow like it’s telling secrets.

Outside the frame? I’m your classic Irish rogue—tattooed, music loud enough to shake the walls, book in hand (probably with a half-drunk coffee beside it), and always up for an adventure, especially the kind that starts with “I probably shouldn’t…” and ends with a story worth retelling.

I crave deep convos, cheeky chemistry, and the kind of connection that makes the world fade out like the end of a good film. If you’re a fellow dreamer, night owl, or someone who knows there’s beauty in being truly seen—then maybe we’re overdue for a little spark of something.

But if someone stands way too close in a nearly empty line at a coffee shop, it’s kinda weird and uncomfortable, right? 🤔 I wonder if it’s got something to do with our social norms and how we're conditioned to feel okay with different amounts of physical space depending on the context. 

I mean, it's like when you're with your close friends or family, you're usually cool with getting cozily close, but with strangers... not so much. It’s like we have this invisible bubble that can expand or shrink based on the situation or the vibes we get from others. Maybe it's some evolutionary thing where we feel safer in numbers or something?

There may be a way!

To shift your biological sleep-wake rhythm towards earlier wake times, i.e., become a morning person, bright light in the morning is your ally.

Light is the dominant synchronizer (""zeitgeber"") of the human circadian rhythm (= your inner clock).

To shift your circadian rhythm towards the morning, longer durations of bright light are more potent. If you're serious about it, you'll want to get multiple hours instead of just 10-60 minutes. [\[St Hilaire 2012\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3406389/)

The problem is, how can you get multiple hours of morning bright light exposure each day?  
**Well, there may be a ""hack"" available!**

Researchers found that **6 cycles of 15min bright light** \+ 45 min dim light led to similar shifts in circadian rhythm as 6 hours of uninterrupted bright light. [\[Gronfier 2004\]](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00385.2003)

In a second study, 3.5h of morning bright light led to similar results as just 3.5h of intermittent 30min bright light + 30 min dim light. [\[Burgess 2003\]](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0748730403253585)

➡ **Intermittent lighting schedules over long periods could work almost as well as the full duration!**

How could you use this to be a morning person? Here's my current schedule:

BRIGHT: 30min after waking up (daylight lamp/light visor/breakfast on balcony)  
DIM: brush teeth, shower get dressed  
BRIGHT: Walk/bike to work (already after sunrise)  
DIM: Morning coffee at office, chat with colleagues  
BRIGHT: 30min bright light session at desk (using daylight lamp)  
....afterwards, a suitably bright office light setting and ""daylight breaks"" outside.

As mentioned in previous posts, the Stainless Steel Syntesi has been on my wishlist for quite some time, and finally here it is.  
  
Many friends had told me that this razor was not deep whatsoever and it would not fit my shaving style, but I decided to purchase it anyway and oh my god what a surprise. First pass WTG did very little, but after the second pass AGT I was left with a crazy smooth BBS and no irritation at all. This razor provides little to no blade feel and a surprisingly close shave, as well as a super intuitive angle due to the head's geometry. Even though it was my first time with it, it made me feel as if I had owned it since forever and the comfort was instant.

Not much to say about the soap that hasn't been already said, crazy scent, crazy mechanics and fair price. If I were to try this soap blindly, I would have bet it was a tallow base, but it's not. The aftershave feels quite viscous and oily, not sticky, but super soothing and it left my skin as smooth as a feather.

I’ve been living in Bali for the past 8 years - moved here in 2017 and never really left. I’ve seen the island go through a lot: pre-pandemic calm, post-Instagram boom, COVID shutdowns, and now the 2025 comeback.

If you’re planning a trip or wondering whether Bali is still worth visiting, here’s a real breakdown of what’s still magical, what’s changed, and how to experience the best of it without the burnout.

# What’s Still Great in 2025:

**1. Bali’s spirit is still alive — just outside the hotspots**

* Rituals, ceremonies, and temple offerings are still a part of daily life — even in areas with heavy tourism.
* Places like **Sidemen**, **Munduk**, **Pemuteran**, and parts of **Tabanan** still feel authentic and beautifully untouched.

**2. Food scene is amazing (and getting better)**

* You can eat like royalty for under $5 at a warung — or have a five-course plant-based tasting menu in the jungle.
* Coffee culture here is legit — even in smaller towns now.

**3. Bali’s wellness scene is evolving**

* Think jungle spas, hidden yoga decks, cacao ceremonies, and ice bath circles — especially around Ubud, but now spreading to quieter regions too.

# What’s Changed (and not always for the better):

**1. Overdevelopment is real**

* **Canggu** has exploded — it’s got traffic, construction noise, and chain-style cafes. Still fun for some, but not the Bali people imagine.
* **Ubud center** is busy during the day and way more commercial now. But 10 minutes outside the center feels like a different world.

**2. Infrastructure stress**

* Water shortages are already hitting southern Bali.
* Rubbish and plastic are a daily issue — especially during rainy season.
* That said, there are more community-led efforts around sustainability now than ever.

**3. Insta-tourism is in full swing**

* Places like Lempuyang Temple, Handara Gate, and Kelingking Beach are flooded with tripods and long queues.
* But: many incredible spots still fly under the radar — locals usually know the way.

# Tips from a Local for a Better Trip:

* Want peace + scenery? Base yourself in **Sidemen**, **Munduk**, **Amed**, or **north Tabanan**.
* [Hire a local driver ](https://mybalitrips.com/en/rent-car/?utm_source=reddit)and skip the rushed “Instagram tour” routes — most drivers will happily customize and show you real gems.
* **Avoid big-name temples midday** \- go at sunrise or just find smaller village temples (you’ll often be the only visitor).
* Try **locally run cooking classes, craft workshops, or farm visits** \- you’ll support the community *and* have a more meaningful experience.

# Final Thoughts - Is Bali Still Worth It?

**Yes - 100% - but it depends how you do it.**  
Bali has changed, no doubt. Some places feel more like a tropical version of LA now. But the heart of the island? Still here. Still powerful. Still worth slowing down for.

But if it stays high for a long time, it can make you feel tired, anxious, or sick and may even cause weight gain. Here are some easy and natural ways to lower cortisol: 

1. **Eat healthy foods:** Have a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Also, avoid too much sugar and processed food. 

2. **Reduce caffeine:** Too much coffee or tea, especially past noon, can raise cortisol. Avoid it. 

3. **Sleep well:** Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep. Set a calming bedroom environment. No screen before bed and sticking to regular bedtime and wake time routine helps. 

4. **Practice mindfulness:** Simple things like deep breathing, journaling, spending time with loved ones or quick meditation sessions can calm the body and nervous system. 

5. **Move regularly**: Walking, light exercise, or dancing are helpful in balancing stress hormones. 

6. **Enjoy fun activities:** Laughter, music, hobbies, and time with friends or pets can lower stress. 

7. **Talk to a doctor about supplements**: Magnesium, omega-3, or ashwagandha may support healthy cortisol, but checking with your health professional is important. ",1,1750061133.0,u_WellnessExtractUS,0,1.0,False

She Keeps Talking About All the Bodies in the Basement... Part 2,"She was having a good morning, she knew my name, asked if I wanted coffee, even hummed some old song that I assumed had been playing on the kitchen radio for a few minutes. It felt like time folded in on itself, like I was a teenager again and nothing had changed. But the thing about dementia is that it's never linear. The memories come in waves, some real, some scrambled, and you never know what shore they'll wash up on. She was buttering toast when she paused, knife hovering over the bread, her eyes fixed on something far away. 

“They said he always came out at night,” she said softly. I looked up from my mug. 

“Who does?” She didn't answer right away, just stared through the window like she was for something to appear in the trees. 

“I heard it calling him…” She whispered “like a lullaby, sweet and sticky, and he followed it right into the dark”

 I didn't ask who he was. 

I didn't have to because I remembered.

2002 –

It was Friday night. The one right after school had let out. We had a tradition that summer, dragging sleeping bags and pillows out into Ty’s backyard and pretending we were roughing it even though the back porch lot was still in view and his mom let us use the bathroom inside. 

The whole crew was there, Josh, Cody, Ty, Jules. Alex , Bradley and me. 

We stayed up too late, roasting marshmallows over the fire pit, telling each other increasingly wild stories about what we thought was living in the basement of the Langley house. 

The creature had names, powers even a back story. We built it together out of fear and bravado, each of us trying to one up the last.

 I think we all knew it wasn't real until it was. 

That night I woke up around 2:00 AM, the kind of wake up that slaps you in the chest with no dream attached. 

I had to pee, so I slipped out of my sleeping bag and crept to the far end of the yard where the grass turned into woods. 

And that's when I saw it. 

At first I thought it was just shadows playing tricks on me, but then I heard it. A voice, not loud, not clear, more like a melody, humming gently and syrupy and wrong. 

I stepped closer to the fence, heart thudding. That's when I saw the boy. He couldn't have been more than 9 or 10. 

I didn't know him, not really, but I'd seen him around the trailer park.

 He was barefoot in a T-shirt too big for him, staring straight ahead like he was sleepwalking. 

He was following the voice. I watched, frozen, as he crossed the street. 

The yellow porch lights of Briarwood Lane, flickering like dying fireflies. 

And walked around to the side of the Langley house, right to the basement door, And standing just beside it was something else. 

I couldn't see its face, just the shape. Tall, slouched, like it didn't know how to wear its skin properly. One arm was too long, the other hung limp like it had been broken and never healed, and its head… it tilted to the side, twitching, watching the boy like he was a treat wrapped in tinfoil.

 The basement door creaked open. The boy disappeared inside. The thing followed him in. The door shut and I couldn't move. 

I don't remember falling asleep. 

I don't remember crawling back into my sleeping bag. But when I woke up, it was morning hot and bright and full of bees buzzing around the soda cans. 

And then the sirens started.

The police started searching for the boy early that morning.

 So we decided to roll up to the sheriff's station like we were on a mission from God. 

Bikes squealing, backpacks bouncing, Ty nearly crashing into the curb like an idiot. 

“Watch it, Jackass!” Alex barked, swerving around him. 

“It's the brakes, OK?” Ty said, hopping off and letting his bike thud to the sidewalk.

 “I told my mom to fix them.”

“You also told us your cousin was in Blink 182,” Jules muttered, pushing open the front door. 

Inside, the air was cold and smelled like stale coffee and whatever was rotting in the vending machine.

 Sheriff Barnes sat behind the counter, half the chicken biscuit in his hand and the other half in his mustache. 

He looked up with a grunt. “And what the hell is this?”

 Josh stepped forward; chest puffed out like he thought he was in an action movie. 

“We need to file a report…”

 Barnes raised an eyebrow. “A report?”

“ Yeah,” Ty said. “A missing kid report. You know, like for a kid that's missing.”

The sheriff dropped the biscuit on a napkin and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

 “Jesus Christ, it's not even ten yet.”

“Doesn't make the kid less missing,” Jules said. 

“I saw him,” I said quickly, stepping in before things went completely sideways. 

“Last night, he was going into the Langley house.”

 Barnes froze. 

Bradley shuffled his feet beside me, quiet as ever. 

“It was like, like something was leading him.”

 The room went quiet for a second, then Cody broke the silence. 

“He means like a monster, but like the bad kind, not the cookie Monster kind,”

Barnes sighed.

 Like he just aged 10 years in five seconds. “A monster? You all see it?”

 “We didn't all see it,” Josh admitted, scratching at the side of his neck. 

But he did, and we believe him. 

Alex crossed her arms, “Because we're not morons. You think it's a coincidence another kid vanishes and it's always the same area?”

“It had long arms.” I said, staring at the worn-down patch on the desk.

 “One of them didn't move right, like it was broken and it was humming.”

 “humming?” Barnes echoed.

 “Like a song. I don't know,” I said. “Just this low creepy noise, like, like cicadas, but in a person's throat.”

 Cody mimicked it, “buzzing like a bug.”

 Alex slapped his shoulder, “not helping.”

 The sheriff stood slowly and walked around the counter.

 His belt creaked; badge glinted under the fluorescence. 

He looked at each of us like we were a row of rusted out bicycles. He was about to toss in the trash. 

“You kids been watching scary movies again?”

Jules rolled her eyes. “Oh my God”

“maybe one with a spooky house. Monsters in the dark,” Barnes added. “Maybe aliens?”

 “No, Sir,” Bradley said. “isn't a game.”

 Barnes let out a long sigh. “You want my advice? Go home, stay out of that damn house, and stop stirring up trouble while the whole town's already on edge.”

 “But I saw him,” I whispered, “the kid and that thing.”

 He stared at me for a long second, then turned around and headed back behind the desk.

 “Go. I don't want to see you back in here unless there's blood on your shoes and someone's actually dead.”

 “We could be dead next,” Josh muttered under his breath. 

Barnes didn't look up. “Then I guess I'll finally have peace and quiet around here.”

 We filed out slowly, defeated, the bell above the door jingling behind us. 

Outside, the sun was brutal, already baking the pavement hot enough to fry your soles. 

“Great,” Ty muttered, kicking at a crack in the sidewalk,  “That went well.”

 “He thinks we're making it up,” I said. 

“Of course he does,” Jules replied. “Because we're kids. Because if we said we saw a possum and a Tutu, he believed that before Monster and a murder house.”

 Josh spat in the dirt. “Screw it, we'll handle it ourselves.”

 “We are not handling it ourselves,” Bradley said, eyes wide. “It's literally a killing kids.”

 Alex snorted. “So what, we just sit on our asses while it picks off kids like Pokémon cards?”

 “No,” I said. Turning toward the end of the block, where the Langley house sat like a scab on the neighborhood. 

“We're not sitting. We're watching, waiting.”

 “If nobody else is going to stop this thing, then we will.” Josh finished. 

“Because that's what idiots do.” Cody grinned. “And we're the biggest idiots around.”

It was almost 1:00 AM when I checked on her. The house was quiet, too quiet, like the air had been sucked out of it. 

I patted softly to her door, my footsteps muffled by the old carpet. 

Her night light glowed faintly beside the dresser, casting warped shadows across the walls. 

She was curled in bed, barely more than a silhouette beneath the quilt my grandma made. 

Her breathing was shallow but steady, lips moving just slightly. 

“Mom.” I whispered, stepping closer. She didn't answer, 

but then, barely audible, she mumbled something slurred. 

Like a dream trying to breakthrough sleep,

“The boy. Didn't scream,” she whispered. “Just walked down like the others.” 

A chill ran up my spine. I sat beside her bed and gently brushed the hair from her forehead. Her skin was cool, soft as paper. 

“I miss you,” I whispered. Her eyes fluttered, and for just a second it felt like she was looking right at me, really seeing me. 

Then her gaze drifted past me again, unfocused. Just like that, she was gone again…

2002 –

The plan was simple. We'd camp out in Jules backyard, where the fence had just enough of a gap to slip out if we needed. From there, we'd sneak around to the wooded hill behind the Langley house and keep watch. No flashlights, no talking, just eyes on the windows. 

Ty brought Pop Rocks and a can a Surge like he was preparing for a sugar fueled war. 

Alex had a Polaroid camera she swore could capture Ghost. 

Josh brought binoculars. 

Cody wore his ninja turtle pajamas for stealth and nobody had the heart to tell him otherwise.

 Bradley sat beside me in the grass. He didn't say much at first, he rarely did. But he handed me half melted Charleston Chew from his hoodie pocket and smiled. 

“You still like these?” He asked. 

I grinned. “Only when I get them free.” He chuckled, eyes twinkling in the moonlight. 

“Same.”

 Time dragged, the stars blinked overhead, and the woods were alive with cricket noise and the occasional distant owl. 

We passed around a bag of Doritos, whispering theories. 

“OK.” Cody said, licking orange dust off his fingers. “What if it's not a monster, but like, an alien?”

 “Like one of those Gray dudes.”

 “Aliens don't hum like cicadas,” Ty whispered.

“That's like science.”

 “Oh, yeah, you majoring in bug sounds at Harvard?” Alex snapped, earning a giggle from Jules. 

I leaned back in the grass, shoulder brushing Bradley’s. He didn't move away for a long minute.

 We just laid there in the dark, watching the Langley house like it was going to blink. 

“I keep thinking about that kid,” I said softly, only loud enough for Bradley to hear. 

“The one I saw, the way he walked like he wanted to go.” Bradley looked over at me. 

“You think it messes with your head?”

 “I think it already is.” 

He was quiet for a second, then he shifted slightly, his hand brushing mine, not by accident. “You're brave,” he said.

I swallowed. “You're the only one who ever says that.”

 “I mean it.”

 My heart thudded like a drum. The world felt so still. I turned toward him. 

We were close now, so close I could feel his breath.

 I didn't know if it was the night, the fear, the sweet smell of Charleston Chew between us, but I leaned in. 

So did he. 

We were about to kiss when…

 “Ahem.” 

We both jumped. 

Scrambling apart, Alex stood behind us, arms crossed, eyebrows raised. 

She didn't look mad, just amused. 

“Sorry,” she said. “Didn't mean to interrupt your romantic stakeout.” 

Bradley was red in the face. 

“We were just.” She waved it off, “relaxed. Romeo, I'm not your mom.” 

I looked at her, unsure what to say. She smiled softly, crouching beside me. 

“You're good, you know. Both of you,”

 “what do you mean?”

 “I mean, it's OK to like someone even if it's not who other people expect.”

 I blinked.

 “You're not going to tell the others?” She snorted. 

“Please, like I care what Josh thinks.” 

Bradley let out a quiet laugh. Alex patted my shoulder. 

“Don't worry dude, your secret crush is safe with me.”

 Before I could thank her, Jules hissed from the other side of the clearing

 “guys window. Look!”

 We scrambled into position, ducking low in the tall grass. 

The second story window of the Langley house was glowing faintly. No lamp, no TV, just that eerie, flickering yellow. 

Something moved behind the glass. It wasn't a person. It was too tall, too thin. 

Its body jerking like a puppet in water, the sound started again. 

Low, vibrating almost inside our skulls. 

That humming the same sound I heard that night with the boy. Bradley grabbed my hand. 

This time I didn't let go.  

We watched it lurch across the 2nd floor, long limbs dangling at its sides, head to low like it was sniffing for something. 

Then it was gone. 

The light snapped off, and for a moment we were frozen, 

Josh whispered. “What the hell was that?” 

Ty clutched his arm. “Dude, it's real. I told you it's real.”

 “Shut up,” Alex hissed. “Look by the back door.” 

A shape emerged from the Langley house, tall and hunched, gliding across the back yard. 

Without a sound, even the wind seemed to hold its breath. It was heading towards the woods. 

No one said a word. We all just moved, crawling, crouching, cutting through Jules backyard and slipping under the fence gap like shadows. 

The woods were damp and heavy with the smell of pine and stagnant air, our shoes, crunched twigs and soggy leaves. Fireflies blinked in the distance, but it felt like even they were keeping their distance from what we were chasing. 

We followed the thing quietly, terrified but not stopping. Bradley stayed close to me, breathing fast. 

I could feel the tension in him, every step forward a silent dare. 

“Do you see it?” Cody whispered, squinting into the dark there. Alex pointed through the trees, down a hill through the clearing was a lake. 

Not the nice kind where people fish or skip rocks.

 This was the forgotten kind. 

Marky still surrounded by cat tails and gnats. 

A patch of moonlight skimmed the surface, turning it into a silver bruise. The creature was there, kneeling by the water's edge, its back to us. 

It was doing something with its hands. Digging, washing. 

We crept closer, barely breathing. It dipped something into the water, something that made a wet slapping sound, something soft.

 And then it stood up, turned its head. 

We dropped to the ground instantly. 

Ty was shaking beside me, “Don't move. Don't even blink.”

 The thing paused, then melted back into the woods, vanishing between the trees. 

None of us said anything for a full minute, then Alex stood slowly, “We have to see what it was doing. 

“No way,” Josh muttered, “I'm not getting eaten by Slender Man's cousin.” 

“We came this far,” she snapped.

 “What if someone's hurt” 

that did it.

 One by one, we got to our feet and walked toward the edge of the lake, our flashlights off, only moonlight and fear guiding our steps. 

The first thing I noticed was the smell. 

Rot. 

An iron and pond scum. 

And then we saw it.

 Half submerged in the reeds.

 Torn open like a gutted deer. 

It was a boy, the one I saw, the one I tried to forget. 

His shirt was the same blue with yellow sleeves now soaked and stained. 

His mouth was open, eyes wide. 

His skin looked chewed. I backed away, bile rising in my throat.

 Jules screamed. 

Cody started crying. Josh just stood there whispering, “no, no, no, no, no.”

 Bradley grabbed my shoulder, pulling me back, “We need to go.”

 “we have to tell someone,” Alex said, her voice shaking. 

“We did tell someone,” I muttered “and he didn't believe us.”

 “Then we make him. We'll go to Sheriff Barnes in the morning,” Ty said. “Bring him here.” 

“We can't wait,” I said. 

“What if it moves him or eats him?” Cody whimpered.

 “We'll all go together,” Alex said. 

“He can't ignore all of us.” 

I looked down at the body one last time, and then up at the trees, at the dark. It was still out there, watching, waiting.

Present day –

It was just after 10:00 AM when I stepped into her room. 

The curtains were drawn halfway, letting in that soft milky light that always made the dust look like snow. 

My mom was lying on her side, facing the window. 

Her breathing was slow, shallow, peaceful For once. 

I sat on the edge of the bed and brushed a strand of hair from her cheek. 

“Hey, Mom,” I said gently. She didn't answer. Sometimes she didn't. Other times, the things she said stuck in me like splinters. 

I reached for the bottle of pills on her night stand and started sorting out her dosage on the Monday morning compartment. Behind me, I heard her voice, soft, barely audible. 

“He still hungry,” She mumbled. 

I froze.

 Her eyes were still closed. “Who, Mom?” I whispered. “Who's hungry?” 

She didn't answer, just sighed and curled slightly tighter under her blanket like a child.

 I left the room with my heart pounding because I know exactly what she meant.

2002-

We met in Ty’s backyard just past the broken swing set and the plastic kiddie pool full of sand. 

Everyone was buzzing, tense.

 We hadn't slept after what we saw. 

Bradley paced like he was on trial. Alex had her arms crossed tight, jaw set like stone. 

Josh kept checking his watch even though it wasn't working. 

Jules hugged herself, eyes darting between the trees. 

“Where's Cody?”

 “He said he was coming to” 

 “he probably overslept.”

 “He's never late,” Bradley said. “Not when it's important.”

 Josh waved it off. “He's probably raiding the pantry again. Let's just go.”

 “We should wait.” I said “we shouldn't split up.”

 But the others were already walking. 

We headed toward town, cutting across the empty lot behind the gas station, past the sun, faded soda machines and the cluster of crows on the power lines that always seemed to be watching. 

Sheriff Barnes office was on main two doors down from the diner and just across from the old movie rental place. His cruiser was out front, lights off. 

The door creaked when we stepped inside. Sheriff Barnes looked up from behind his desk, eyes tired and lined. Like cracked leather. He raised an eyebrow. 

“What now?”

 Alex stepped forward; shoulders squared. “We saw it. The thing that's been taking the boys.”

 “We saw it near the lake last night.”

 Barnes exhaled slowly. 

“Alex…”

 “I'm not joking. We saw it, and we found…” she swallowed. “We found the body. Another kid by the lake.”

 He stared at her for a beat, then leaned back in his chair.

 “You kids have no idea what kind of trouble this could stir up.”

 “We're telling the truth.” I said “we wouldn't come here unless…”

 the phone on his desk rang.

 Barnes picked it up, muttered a few words, then paused. 

His face went pale. 

His grip on the receiver tightened

“when” he asked. 

Another pause, then he hung up. 

He stood slowly. 

“What's wrong?” Jules asked. 

The sheriff looked at us. 

“Cody Mendez,” He said “his mom just called. He never came home last night.”

 The world seemed to tilt between our feet. 

“No,” Bradley whispered. “No, he was just with us.”

 “He said he'd meet us,” Jules said, voice trembling. 

Barnes grabbed his hat and keys. 

“Get home, all of you. Now, this isn't a game anymore.”

 But we didn't move, because we already knew what he didn't. It had taken Cody too and now we were next…

We didn’t go home.

We scattered for show, ducked around the corner, and regrouped behind the Family Dollar.

Bradley’s eyes were red, fists clenched so tight his knuckles had gone white.

“He’s not gone,” he said. “He’s not. Not until we see.”

“We don’t even know where they’re looking,” Alex said, her voice low. “Sheriff said to go home. He’ll just write us off again.”

“I got the walkies,” Ty said, holding up a pair of chunky black radios with duct tape on the sides. “One’s on their channel. My brother used to work security—left it behind when he moved. Still works.”

We all exchanged looks.

No one said no.

Ty handed one to Josh and clipped the other to his belt, flicking it on. Static hissed, then a voice crackled through.

“…deputy says they’re moving search efforts toward Ridge Quarry. Dogs caught a scent trail.”

“Quarry,” I whispered. My stomach dropped.

“That’s where they found the shoe,” Jules said. “Last week. By the fence.”

We moved fast—cutting through the brush behind the baseball field, then through the drainage tunnel beneath the highway. The summer sun was still heavy, but everything felt darker somehow.

By the time we got to the top of the quarry ridge, the police were already there.

We crouched low in the trees, hidden in the scrub, hearts hammering.

Sheriff Barnes stood near the edge of the water, his arms crossed, lips pressed into a grim line. A couple of deputies were knee-deep in the water, guiding something toward the shore.

“No,” Bradley whispered.

The shape was small. Lifeless.

A pair of red sneakers we all recognized.

Cody.

His body was bloated, his arms twisted strangely, like he’d been thrown or dropped from a height. His face was… wrong. Bruised. Pale. One of the deputies covered it with a towel almost immediately.

Jules turned and buried her face in Alex’s shoulder, sobbing.

Ty dropped the walkie. The static hissed into the silence like a funeral dirge.

We stayed there, frozen. Watching them pull our friend from the quarry like a forgotten doll.

Sheriff Barnes rubbed a hand over his mouth. He looked wrecked. Not surprised. Just tired. Like someone who'd known this was coming all along.

I felt something splinter inside me.

This wasn’t a game.

Cody was dead.

It was real. It was hunting us.

And it wasn’t finished.

We didn’t speak as we walked back through the woods. It wasn’t the same silence as before. This one sat heavier, like wet clothes sticking to your skin. Like grief had shape and weight and could follow you home.

When we reached the clearing behind Ty’s trailer, we stopped.

No one moved.

Jules stepped forward and turned to face us. Her eyes were puffy, her voice raw.

“I can’t do this,” she whispered. “Cody’s dead. You saw him. And we’re just kids, okay? We’re not detectives. We’re not… heroes in some movie.”

Bradley started to say something, but she cut him off.

“We could be next.”

No one disagreed. Because she wasn’t wrong.

“We *have* to figure out what’s doing this,” I said. “We *know* it’s not an animal. We *know* something’s out there, and Sheriff Barnes won’t listen to us. If we don’t do something, who’s next? Ty? Jules? One of *us*?”

“I’m sorry,” Jules said, her voice shaking. “I just want it to stop.”

Then she turned and walked away, disappearing down the hill toward her house. We didn’t follow.

Alex looked down at the dirt. “I don’t blame her.”

Bradley ran a hand through his hair. “We need a plan.”

Ty nodded. “Tomorrow. Meet at my place. Noon.”

We all agreed. Quietly. Somberly. It didn’t feel brave. It felt desperate.

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

**Present Day-**

The attic was hotter than I remembered.

I came up here to look for the box of old summer clothes but got sidetracked by the smell of mothballs and old cardboard. The past has a smell, and up here it clung to everything.

That's when I saw it—an old plastic crate with peeling Ninja Turtles stickers on the side.

I opened it without thinking.

Inside were relics from a different world: a scratched *Spider-Man* VHS, a cracked yo-yo, a walkie talkie with the duct tape still on the antenna… and a folded sheet of red paper.

I picked it up slowly. It was faded, creased. My throat tightened as I realized what it was.

A flyer.

**MISSING – CODY SUTTON**  
Last seen July 15, 2002 – Age 13 – Red sneakers

I stared at it for a long time.

And then something under the flyer caught my eye—a Polaroid.

It was blurry, the edges browned from age. But there we were. All of us. Me, Ty, Bradley, Alex, Jules, Josh… and Cody. We were all standing in front of Ty’s trailer, Cody’s arm around my shoulder, his grin toothy and wide.

My chest ached.

And then I remembered the next part.

The night after the quarry, I couldn’t sleep. I’d gone out to the back porch to get some air… and that’s when I saw it again.

The thing. The creature. Watching from the trees.

Only that time—it waved.

Ty’s front yard looked like a war room—spread-out bike helmets, empty slushie cups, and a wrinkled road map of Briarwood Lane weighed down with rocks. We’d been waiting almost half an hour before anyone said what we were all thinking.

“She’s not coming,” Alex muttered, kicking at a stick.

“Jules is just scared,” Bradley said. “We all are.”

“I say we go to her house,” I said. “She deserves to say no to our faces.”

Ty frowned but nodded. “Yeah. Let's go.”

It wasn’t far. Everything in Briarwood Lane was within biking distance. The ride was short and quiet, the only sounds the click of gears and tires on gravel.

Jules lived in a small blue house near the end of Cedar Ridge, where the street dipped and the trees grew taller. Her older sister Savannah answered the door, leaning on the frame like she already knew why we were there. She was sixteen and didn’t hang with us, but everyone knew who she was—varsity cheer, way too cool, and the girl all the boys crushed on but were too scared to talk to.

Except Cody. He used to call her ""Vanna Banana"" just to piss her off.

Her smile faded when she saw our faces. “I heard,” she said softly. “About Cody.”

Bradley nodded. “We need to talk to Jules.”

Savannah hesitated, then stepped aside. “She’s in her room. Hasn’t really come out.”

The five of us stepped inside. It smelled like hairspray and vanilla lotion, the fan in the hallway humming a soft drone. Savannah led us to the door at the end of the hall and knocked gently.

“Jules,” she said, “your little friends are here.”

No answer.

“Come on,” Savannah said, not unkindly. “They came all this way, and they look like hell.”

Still silence.

“I know you’re scared,” she added, “but you’ve always been the brave one. You were the one who climbed the water tower first. You were the one who made me walk you to the Langley place when you were ten just to *spit* on the porch.”

Something shuffled inside. The door cracked open.

Jules stood there, eyes red, but her shoulders squared. “This doesn’t mean I want to go,” she said, looking at me.

“I’m not asking you to,” I said. “But I am asking you to help us stop this… for Cody.”

Jules looked past us, then up at Savannah. “Will you come?”

Savannah blinked. “Me?”

“You always said I should stop being scared of things that go bump in the night,” Jules said. “So let’s go see what’s making all the noise.”

Savannah looked surprised—but then she smiled.

“Fine,” she said. “But I’m not walking through the woods in flip flops.”

That night, Mom made spaghetti. The sauce was from a jar, the noodles a little too soft, but I didn’t care. We ate on the couch, plates balanced on paper towels instead of real napkins, the TV casting a bluish glow across the room. *Back to the Future* was on cable, and she quoted every line like it was scripture.

“You’re gonna see some serious shit,” she said with a grin, pointing at the screen just before the DeLorean took off. “Classic.”

I laughed, even though she’d said that same thing every time we watched it.

After dinner, she ran her fingers through my hair. “You okay?” she asked.

I shrugged. “Yeah.”

She studied me for a moment. “You’ve been quiet lately.”

“It’s just… stuff with the guys. Weird summer.”

“You’re thirteen. It’s supposed to be weird.”

“I guess.”

She nudged me. “Hey. I know this house gets creepy sometimes. Especially at night. But you’re safe here, alright?”

“I know.”

“You promise me something?”

“Yeah?”

“Don’t go chasing shadows just because the world feels dark. Not everything strange is worth finding.”

It was such a weird thing to say at the time, I didn’t think much of it. But now… now I wonder if she already knew something. Something I didn’t.

The plan was simple: wait until she was asleep, sneak out the back door, and meet the others by the edge of Briarwood Lane. Ty had a flashlight. Josh brought the gloves. I brought nerves and a stomach full of half-digested spaghetti.

We met up under the busted old streetlight at the edge of the woods.

“You sure about this?” Alex asked. She had her hair tied back, and she looked serious, like she was going to war.

“I need to see it,” I said. “We all do.”

The Langley house loomed in the distance, half-hidden behind tall grass and overgrown trees. Its windows were still boarded up, the paint still peeling, the silence around it so deep it almost hurt to breathe.

Savannah, Jules, and Bradley hung back by the fence line, crouched behind some shrubs.

“We’ll keep watch,” Savannah whispered. “Yell if anything happens.”

The four of us—me, Ty, Josh, and Alex—crept along the side of the house. That’s when we saw it: a narrow opening along the bottom of the foundation, just big enough to crawl through.

“Think it goes under the whole place?” Ty asked.

“Only one way to find out,” Alex said, already getting on her hands and knees.

Josh groaned. “God, it smells like mildew and rat piss.”

“Shut up and move,” Alex hissed.

We crawled one by one under the house, the dirt cold against our palms. Cobwebs clung to our faces, and something skittered past Josh’s hand, making him curse under his breath. The beams above our heads were low and rotting, but we kept moving.

After what felt like forever, the crawlspace opened up into a dark, empty room. The air changed—colder, like something lived here that wasn’t supposed to.

Ty’s flashlight flicked around the space.

There was a rusted furnace, a few crumpled beer cans, and something else—scratches along the floorboards, deep ones, like someone had been dragged.

“I don’t like this,” Josh whispered.

“We’re already in,” I said. “Might as well keep going.”

We hadn’t even realized it yet.

We weren’t alone.

Inside the Langley House  
The air was thick and musty. It smelled like mold, rot, and something else—something sour, metallic. Like blood that had dried and gone sticky in the heat.

Ty’s flashlight cut through the gloom as we stepped out of the crawlspace and into what must’ve once been a basement storage room.

There was a mattress in the corner, yellowed with age and stained in places I didn’t want to think about. Torn clothing was piled nearby—little shirts, socks, a shoe with a cartoon character printed on the side. A cracked baby monitor sat on a shelf, its red light still flickering faintly.

Josh picked something up and turned pale. “Dude... this is a library card. For Trevor Hill.”

Alex turned her light toward the wall. “Guys…”

Scratched into the wood, over and over again, were the words:  
**“MAKE IT QUIET. MAKE IT STOP. MAKE IT QUIET. MAKE IT STOP.”**

We were all frozen, breathing heavy, hearts pounding.

“I don’t think we’re alone,” I said.

And then—*creak.*

We all whipped around. Ty had wandered toward the stairwell.

“Ty,” Alex whispered. “What are you doing?!”

He turned back, shrugging. “We gotta know where it goes. Maybe it leads up into the—”

A blur. A noise like a shriek and a hiss mashed together.

Then Ty was gone—ripped off his feet by something dark and massive at the top of the stairs. He screamed as it dragged him halfway up the steps, flailing.

“TY!” Josh yelled, lunging forward.

There was another horrible sound—bones crunching, wood snapping—and then Ty *fell.* Straight over the stairwell railing, landing hard on a broken beam jutting up from a pile of debris below. He didn’t scream again. Just gasped.

“Shit—shit—he’s impaled—” I choked out.

Josh and I were at his side in seconds. Blood was bubbling from Ty’s mouth, and his eyes were wide with pain, but he was alive.

Alex shined the light up the stairs. The *thing* was still there, crouched in the shadows. Its eyes glowed faintly—reflecting back like a cat’s, but wrong. Too high. Too human.

“We gotta go NOW,” I shouted.

Josh nodded, grabbing Ty’s shoulders while I grabbed his legs. He was heavy and slick with blood. We half-dragged, half-carried him back toward the crawlspace, our hearts jackhammering.

The creature shrieked again and came pounding down the stairs—too fast, too loud, limbs hitting the walls like a spider made of meat and nightmares.

“FASTER!” Alex screamed, holding the flashlight behind us to try and blind it.

We shoved Ty through the crawlspace first. He groaned, the piece of wood still stuck in his gut. Josh followed, pushing him, then Alex.

I was last.

I turned back just once—and it was *right there.* Not five feet away. Crawling fast, its limbs bending the wrong way, mouth too wide, eyes too dark. I scrambled backward through the dirt as it slammed into the crawlspace entrance, clawing, snarling—but it was too big to fit.

It screamed like it was *frustrated.* Like it knew it missed its chance.

We didn’t stop until we were clear of the house, dragging Ty through the brush, all of us bloody and shaking. Savannah and Jules were already running toward us when they saw us burst out from under the porch.

“What the hell happened?!” Savannah shouted.

Alex fell to her knees. “It was real. It’s *real.*”

Bradley ripped off his shirt and pressed it against Ty’s wound. “He needs a hospital—*now.*”

Jules was pale, frozen in place.

We all were.

Because none of us could deny it anymore.

There was something evil in the Langley house.

Present Day-

My hands were trembling. I hadn’t thought about that night in years—maybe I hadn’t *let* myself. The way Ty screamed, the weight of his body as we dragged him out, the sound of that *thing* slamming into the crawlspace wall.

I closed my eyes for a moment. Let the silence settle. Let my heart slow.

Then I reached for my laptop and opened Facebook.

The screen lit up, a quiet hum filling the room.

I didn’t even hesitate. I typed his name:

**Tyrell Carson.**

The page loaded.

There he was.

Profile picture from maybe last year—older, beard now, heavier, a deep scar just visible along the side of his neck. But still him. Still Ty.

My chest tightened.

He had a wife, two kids, a life. Posts about barbecue Sundays, a little girl in dance class, a “Happy 10 years” post from his anniversary.

I stared at the screen for a long time before clicking *Add Friend.*

The request sent.

A strange, aching calm settled over me.

I closed the laptop gently, careful like I was putting away something fragile.

Then I stood, shut off the light, and walked down the hall to my bedroom.

Mom was already asleep. I paused at her door, listened to the gentle rhythm of her breathing, and then moved on.

My bed creaked as I climbed in, the ceiling fan spinning lazily above me. The night outside was thick and quiet, the way it always is when something’s waiting just out of sight.

I stared up at the ceiling and whispered to myself, “You were the last one, weren’t you?”

Then I closed my eyes and let the dark take me.

It started with the sound of cicadas.

Not soft or distant like usual—but loud, *screaming*, like they were inside my ears. Inside the *walls*. The night pulsed with them.

In the dream, I was back under the house again, knees scraped raw from crawling across splintered wood and dirt. I could see the glow of Ty’s flashlight ahead, bouncing with each breath.

Then it flickered. Went out.

Something moved behind me.

I turned, and the crawlspace wasn’t a crawlspace anymore. It was endless. A long, yawning tunnel of wet breathing shadows. And from the dark, something with fingers like antlers and a mouth of teeth *too wide* crawled forward—

“You forgot about me?”

I woke up gasping, drenched in sweat. The ceiling fan spun lazily above, like it hadn’t just watched a monster lean over me in the dark.

I sat up. Rubbed my face. The house was quiet—too quiet. No humming from the baby monitor I kept near Mom’s room. No rustle of her sheets. Just that creeping silence.

Something in me snapped alert.

I got up.

Walked barefoot down the hallway, the old hardwood cold beneath my feet. Her door was open.

“Mom?”

No answer.

The bed was empty.

Panic hit my chest like a punch.

I checked the bathroom, the kitchen, even the backyard. Nothing.

Then I saw it—just down the road, near the tree line, her figure in the pale orange wash of the streetlamp. Thin robe clutched tight, barefoot, her gray hair wild like seaweed in the wind.

I ran.

“Mom!”

She didn’t turn.

She kept walking, arms outstretched, muttering something too low to make out.

I reached her just as she stepped into the gravel shoulder.

She screamed.

“My son’s in there! He’s in there! It took him—oh god, it took my baby!”

“Mom, *stop*! It’s me!”

She fought me, weakly pushing at my chest, eyes wide and wet with terror. “He took him into the dark! It *pulled* him!”

“*Mom.*”

I grabbed her face, gently, firmly. Made her look at me.

“*I’m right here, okay? It’s me. I’m your son. I’m right here.***”**

For a second, she just stared.

Then her hands dropped, trembling.

Her lips quivered. “Oh… oh, sweetheart…” she whispered, her whole body deflating like a balloon losing air.

“I was so scared,” she said, softer now. “I heard you calling. I *heard* you.”

I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. “I know. But you’re safe now. Let’s go home.”

I wrapped an arm around her and walked her back down the road in the dark.

The stars above us didn’t blink. The wind didn’t blow. The night just watched us, quiet and still.

And in the silence, the cicadas hummed.",1,1750060851.0,spoopycjades,0,1.0,False

Here's a little about me. I have lived in Minnesota my whole life, mostly west of the cities in the country but I now live a little south of Minneapolis because of my job. I really enjoy music, both making music and listening. Most of the stuff I listen and/or create is dance stuff (deep house if you wanna get specific). I also really enjoy indie/alternative. I travel quite a bit for shows and such, but I also like to take more touristy trips for sightseeing and such. When I'm not doing any of that, I like to hang out with friends. Whether it's playing cards, playing disc golf, Mario Party, we make the most of our time.

I have tried the dating apps and I have had no luck with those. I got a few matches but none of them really interested me. Going to the bar, getting drunk, and if it leads to it hooking up, is silly to me. I am also 100% sober so I never go to the bar unless my friends are there doing stuff haha.

I'm looking for a woman that is creative, whether that is painting, music, writing, etc. Tell me all about your creative hobbies I'd love to learn. Most importantly though is communication. Being able to discuss how you feel and being open is important to me. Open communication is so important for any kind of relationship, romantic or not.

1lcn0id,https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterrage/comments/1lcn0id/yet_another_wilds_post_this_game_just_sadden_me/,"Yet another Wilds post, this game just sadden me.","For context, I'm not a veteran neither am playing the series from a long time ago, I start with Rise three years ago and really loved it. In the last year, I've got all achievements on World/Iceborne and I'm working towards the Rise/Sunbreak ones

Now I have some glaring issues with Wilds, but I will start with what I find good and what I love about the game because I genuinely want to love this game. 

First, I think the bestiary of the game is very good, Rey Dau is probably my favorite monster after Nergigante and even the worst monster of the game are okay at worst in my opinion, I also really love Xu wu and Nu udra, I like introducing new type of monsters that haven't been seen before in the series.

I think the ost is good, I really love the Rey Dau theme, it fit perfectly well the monster and the music slap even without the game, also love the Zoh shia one and the ""Proof of a hero"" variation is probably my favorite one in the series 

I really love how the game is controlling, it's very fluid and with the focus mode, attacking and dodging feel way more seamless than in other entries.

Now for the things I don't love about the game, take a coffee and sit down:

I won't enter in details but the performance on the PC version are really bad, in 60 hours of gameplay, I've had more crash and issues than with every other games I've played ever, while reaching the recommended specs and doing every possible ""fix"" that we can find on Internet 

I don't mind an easy game, sometimes I just want to hit big monster to release stress after a long day, but what I don't really like is an easy game even without using and engaging with the mechanics. I never had a single moment in the game where I used others item than healing one, never have I looked at a monster weakness and their attacks' elements to see which armor or weapon I should use or even take the time to see which skills would be good with my play style. Even with ignoring all this, I've never had a single time in the game where I have said to myself ""oh I may fail this quest, maybe I'm not well prepared"" I've just smoothly played through the game without any resistance.

I feel like the Monster Hunter series is known for having very long game full of content, I've played more than 200 hours at World and I'm reaching 100 hours on Rise while I don't even have touched Sunbreak and there's tons of things that I haven't done yet and even then there's tons of shit that I didn't do in World cause I only sticked to the achievements. In Wilds, after 60 hours, I don't think there's really any interesting things to do anymore. While I like the idea of having Title update to spice up things and they are a great excuse to launch the game again, I feel like some of the things should have been added from the start(like gathering hub) and that they won't add anything meaningful others than hitting other monsters. I think 60 hours is generally great for many games, but I feel like I didn't do anything meaningful in these 60 hours except hitting monsters. In Rise we had the rampage quest to change pace a bit and many sidequests that were asking to capture monsters and gather some items for NPC, in World we had sidequest like in Rise, some arena quests, different hunt type with the Zorah Magdaros but in Wilds, I feel like everything is just ""kill this monster"", every time there's a sidequest, everytime an NPC ask me anything, it was always to kill a monster(except for fishing but I'm not a fan of fishing mini games) so after 60 hours of hitting monsters without doing anything else, I feel like there's no reason to keep playing because anyway I'll do the same thing again and again and while I played way less than Rise and World, I feel burn out from the game without even finishing High Rank

Another thing, I don't think the open world is necessary, I feel like there's no reason to explore it, especially because the Sekreit can automatically go to any point we mark on the map, I would always just mark something and open my phone while the Sekreit take me to the destination, so while I love a big space that I can explore, nothing really make me want to because it would just be way less efficient. 

While I didn't touch the multiplayer aspect, I heard that doing a quest with friends is unnecessarily hard and confusing. 

Finally, I think Monster Hunter Wilds have a great base that could make an incredible game, the gameplay is too notch but I wouldn't recommend it in the current state, with performance issues and no meaningful content to do, every time I think about the game, I just feel like I could have played another game in the series if I wanted to play Monster Hunter.

At Syracuse they were in the halls at NYU. They were in the rooms and that was such a long time ago, so I’ve lost touch with how m things are done now.  we had mini fridges and you could rent them if you didn’t want to buy one. I don’t know if that’s still something that’s done? Because I know it’s going to be really hot…. 
I’m assuming most things are the same like bringing laundry supplies, things for the shower, laptop, personal item etc.

She sat down on the edge of my bed, fidgeting with her phone. ""And honestly? The kid's gonna be totally fine with River. You don't need to put yourself through some brutal custody war—especially when we both know how that's gonna end.""  
  
I just stared at her, my brain feeling like it was wrapped in cotton. After what felt like forever, I finally managed to get the words out. ""Um... who the hell is River?""  
  
Mackenzie froze mid-sentence, looking at me like I'd just spoken in tongues. It took her a hot minute to snap out of it before she bolted to get the doctor.  
  
The doctor said I had memory loss from the car accident. Mackenzie immediately jumped in, asking how old I thought I was.  
  
I said without any hesitation. ""Eighteen. Didn't I just finish my SATs yesterday?""  
  
Mackenzie completely lost it. She literally crumpled to the floor, laughing so hard she was clutching her stomach and pounding the side of my hospital bed with her fist.  
  
""Willa, oh my GOD! This amnesia thing is like... the universe giving you the ultimate do-over! Yes! You're eighteen, baby! Eighteen and free! No River, no kid, no drama... just you and me against the world!""  
  
Now I was even more confused than before.  
  
Mackenzie took me back to her place once the doctors confirmed my memory probably wasn't coming back anytime soon.  
  
That's when she finally gave me the rundown on my apparently very messy life.  
  
Me—Willa Reynolds—fell head over heels for some broke college guy named River during freshman year.  
  
I spent ten whole years with this dude, from eighteen to twenty-eight. Stuck by him while he was building his empire from nothing, lived off ramen and dreams, popped out two kids for him, and basically became his family's live-in caretaker.  
  
And this year? He decided to divorce my ass.  
  
""Wait, WHAT?"" I practically shrieked.  
  
This sounded like some tragic Lifetime movie bullshit.  
  
After I got over the initial shock, I asked in this shaky voice, ""So you're telling me I spent a decade being someone's unpaid servant, and then got kicked to the curb at twenty-eight?""  
  
Mackenzie nodded grimly. ""Yep. And you've got two kids—your son's six, your daughter's four. But since you were a stay-at-home mom with zero income, and the kids chose to stay with daddy, River got full custody.""  
  
""Hold up... so I lost the kids I spent years raising too?""  
  
Even though I couldn't remember any of this, it sounded absolutely terrifying. I was about to start ugly crying.  
  
Then Mackenzie's whole vibe shifted, and she actually smiled while patting my shoulder. ""Hey, don't look so miserable. At least you're loaded now.""  
  
I blinked back tears and asked cautiously, ""How loaded are we talking?""  
  
Mackenzie sat up straight, looking way too pleased with herself. ""Willa, listen carefully. You walked away with twenty percent of River's assets, ten percent stakes in three publicly traded companies, and two historic townhouses in Manhattan. We're talking about nine hundred million dollars.""  
  
Dead silence.  
  
I stared at her, then asked slowly, ""Mackenzie... you're not messing with me, right?""  
  
""If I'm lying, I'm literally a piece of shit.""  
  
That day, I spent hours just staring out the window at the sky.  
  
I'd lost ten years of memories. I had no clue what my life had been like during that time.  
  
But Mackenzie said I was rich as hell, and eighteen-year-old me had always been obsessed with money.  
  
So honestly? I guess this isn't too bad.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Mackenzie took time off work to help me sort through endless paperwork and property transfers.  
  
I never actually met this River guy—he had his lawyers handle everything in the divorce settlement.  
  
After nearly a month of bureaucratic hell, Mackenzie helped me list all my properties as rentals.  
  
She did the math and told me I'd be pulling in about one-twenty thousand a month just in rent.  
  
That day, staring at my bank account with more zeros than I could count, I looked up at the mirror. The reflection showed a perfectly put-together twenty-eight-year-old version of myself.  
  
I scratched my head. Wow. Not bad at all.  
  
I had nothing but time on my hands while Mackenzie went back to work, so I basically lived at her place playing video games all day.  
  
She'd order food for both of us during lunch breaks.  
  
Mackenzie worked insane hours and would come home looking like death warmed over, collapsing on the couch like a zombie.  
  
I'd put down my controller and give her shoulder rubs. Apparently muscle memory was still intact because I was surprisingly good at it.  
  
Once she'd recovered enough to form sentences, she'd start ranting: ""River is such a piece of shit. Right after you graduated, you were basically his unpaid intern. And when his mom got sick, you'd come home from work just to give her massages and take care of her.""  
  
Mackenzie kept going, then suddenly grabbed my head and flicked my forehead. ""Willa, you were such a pushover! The second I wasn't around, you let them walk all over you. That whole family treated you like garbage because they knew you didn't have anyone else.""  
  
I rubbed my forehead, feeling genuinely hurt. ""Hey, I don't remember any of that stuff! All I remember is you.""  
  
Mackenzie stopped mid-rant, then broke into a huge grin. ""You're right! You don't remember, and that's perfect. Just remember me—I'd never treat you like that.""  
  
I believed her completely, because Mackenzie and I grew up together.  
  
We were both foster kids.  
  
When we were little, I basically followed Mackenzie around everywhere. She'd fight other kids for snacks and help me with laundry.  
  
As we got older, she'd help me with homework. She was a year ahead of me, so when I was a senior, she was already in college, calling me every single day to keep me motivated.  
  
She wanted us to go to the same university, but Mackenzie was way too smart. Even when I studied my ass off, I couldn't get into Harvard like she did.  
  
The day our test scores came out, I just hugged her and cried.  
  
Mackenzie flicked my forehead again. ""What are you crying for? You got a 1480 on your SATs—that's amazing!""  
  
She ruffled my hair. ""You did great.""  
  
I ended up crying all the way to Boston for college.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Talking about it just made Mackenzie feel guilty all over again. ""I never should've let you go to Boston in the first place. If you hadn't gone to Boston, you never would've met River. If you'd never met River...""  
  
I jumped in with the obvious answer: ""Then I wouldn't have nine hundred million dollars.""  
  
Mackenzie put her hands on her hips. ""What's more important—the money or those ten years of your life?""  
  
I tried to guess the right answer: ""The money?""  
  
Mackenzie looked like she wanted to shake some sense into me. ""YOU'RE what's important! If you're miserable, all that money is worthless. Thank God you lost your memory, because if you remembered everything and did something stupid to yourself, what good would any of that money do?""  
  
""Well... it could buy me a really nice headstone...""  
  
Mackenzie cracked up despite herself. ""Oh my God, shut UP!""  
  
Mackenzie had always been incredible, and she still was. She was now a VP at some multinational corporation, pulling in around forty grand a month.  
  
But she was constantly swamped with work and business trips, and she worried about leaving me alone.  
  
So she started dragging me along everywhere. Eventually she figured if she had to babysit me anyway, why not put me to work?  
  
She got me hired as her assistant at her company.  
  
I was so ready for this! I'd spent months reading like fifteen different romance novels about powerful bosses falling for their assistants.  
  
On my first day, I strutted in wearing this killer business dress, feeling like I could take on the world.  
  
I made her coffee, organized her files, ran around doing errands.  
  
I was trying so hard to impress her that she finally started laughing and told me to chill. She handed me a spreadsheet and said, ""Have Ava show you the ropes on this. Take your time learning—no rush.""  
  
""Got it!""  
  
And just like that, I officially entered the workforce.  
  
I started following Mackenzie's schedule, but since I didn't have much on my plate, I usually got off work way earlier than her.  
  
Mackenzie, on the other hand, was buried in work. I'd hang out in the break room waiting for her to finish up every night.  
  
One day, Mackenzie caught me watching online tutorials on my phone and suddenly got serious. ""Willa, do you actually want to learn this stuff for real?""  
  
""Yeah... I really do.""  
  
With the memory loss, I was basically starting from zero at work. I kept screwing things up and it was getting pretty depressing.  
  
Mackenzie had always been my role model growing up, and that hadn't changed. I wanted to be as effortlessly competent as she was. She made everything look so easy and cool.  
  
So Mackenzie enrolled me in classes. After work every day, I'd drive to night school.  
  
I took project management courses mixed with software training programs.  
  
I filled up two entire notebooks before things finally started clicking. Oh, that's how it works!  
  
When I finished that program, Mackenzie signed me up for accounting and finance classes.  
  
After a full year of studying, I finally had my lightbulb moment.  
  
Everything made sense now, and work started feeling natural.

we bought tickets for this year and got a couple problems / questions now, we can't figure out on our own.

1. The festival organizer advertises with a supermarket on the camping grounds. Today we found a surprising topic in the FAQ section regarding pricing. 1 Token equals 1 Beer (approximately 4.50€) which is not much on festival site but imho pretty much on camping site / regular price basis. 
2. They advertise this supermarket as ""fully stocked with everything needed for camping"". Is the assortment comparable with other festival supermarkets like Parookaville? E.G. ice / crushed ice, Beer, meat, sausages, sauces, coffee etc.

Has anyone some experiences?
Does anybody got a list of the assortment and its prices?

Because if it's not as advertised I'd rather take my camping stove with enough cartridges as a BBQ grill to eat something warm.

# 🎬 The Death of Traditional Video Production

Traditional video production is dying.

Equipment costs thousands. Editors charge hundreds per video. The process takes days or weeks.

Meanwhile, AI can automate video creation with AI in minutes.

Professional quality. Consistent output. Fraction of the cost.

The writing is on the wall.

# 🧪 The Experiment That Changed Everything

I decided to test whether AI could replace my entire video production team.

The goal: automate video creation with AI to match human quality at a fraction of the cost.

The challenge: maintaining brand consistency and engagement.

The results shocked me.

AI-generated videos performed better than human-created content.

Higher engagement rates. More consistent posting schedule. Lower production costs.

The automation worked better than manual processes.

# 🔍 Deep Dive: The Technology Stack

When you automate video creation with AI, you need the right technology stack:

**N8N: The Automation Brain** N8N orchestrates the entire workflow. It connects different AI services seamlessly. Scheduling and error handling are built-in. Visual workflow editor makes modifications easy.

**Google VEO 3: The Video Generator** Currently the best AI video generation technology. Produces realistic facial expressions and movements. Handles complex scenarios and environments. Audio synchronization is nearly perfect.

**FAUL: The API Translator** Simplifies complex AI API integrations. Handles authentication and rate limiting automatically. Provides unified access to dozens of AI services. Cost-effective alternative to individual API subscriptions.

**Blow Potato: The Distribution Engine** Automates posting across all major platforms. Optimizes content for each social network. Generates appropriate captions and hashtags. Tracks performance across channels.

# 💡 The Four-Stage Automation Process

Here's exactly how to automate video creation with AI:

**Stage 1: Intelligent Idea Generation** The system starts with an AI agent specialized in creative concepts. It generates unique video ideas based on your parameters. Each idea includes character, scenario, and environment details. Output is structured for easy processing by later stages.

**Stage 2: Advanced Prompt Engineering** Another AI agent converts ideas into technical prompts. These prompts are optimized specifically for VEO 3. Character consistency is maintained across all videos. Environmental details are enhanced for visual appeal.

**Stage 3: High-Quality Video Generation** FAUL sends optimized prompts to Google VEO 3. VEO 3 generates professional-quality videos in 2-5 minutes. Each video includes synchronized audio and realistic movements. Output quality rivals traditional video production.

**Stage 4: Automated Distribution** Blow Potato handles posting across all platforms. Content is optimized for each social network's requirements. Captions and hashtags are generated automatically. Analytics tracking begins immediately upon posting.

# 🎭 Character Development: The Secret to Success

The key to successfully automate video creation with AI is character development.

Generic AI-generated people look fake. Memorable characters build audience loyalty. Consistency across videos creates brand recognition.

**Character Creation Framework:**

**Physical Appearance** Define exact physical characteristics. Include clothing style and accessories. Use the same description in every prompt. Visual consistency builds recognition.

**Personality Traits** Develop unique quirks and mannerisms. Define speech patterns and behaviors. Create backstory and motivations. Personality makes characters memorable.

**Content Style** Establish the character's content niche. Define their expertise and interests. Create recurring themes and storylines. Consistent content style builds audience expectations.

# 💰 Cost-Benefit Analysis: AI vs Traditional Production

**Traditional Video Production Costs:** Equipment: $2,000-$10,000 initial investment Video editor: $50-$200 per video Your time: 2-4 hours per video Total cost for 30 videos/month: $3,500-$8,000

**AI Video Automation Costs:** VEO 3: $3-$6 per video N8N: $0-$20 per month FAUL API: $10-$20 per month Blow Potato: $15-$30 per month Total cost for 30 videos/month: $150-$230

The savings are dramatic. But cost isn't the only benefit.

**Additional Advantages of AI Automation:** Consistent quality across all videos 24/7 production capability No human scheduling conflicts Infinite scalability Perfect brand consistency

# 🚨 Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Audience Feedback** Solution: Regularly engage with your community. Adapt content based on viewer preferences. Respond to comments and suggestions.

**Mistake 3: Over-Relying on Automation** Solution: Balance automation with human creativity. Use AI as a tool, not a replacement for strategy. Maintain authentic connection with your audience.

My thinking is that once broken down enough, I will throw it in the compost and it will boost that as well, right?  
  
It doesnt use a lot of bran, but then I saw I can make my own with coffee grounds, so I would like to try that.  
But, that needs EM1. Hence where I am now at.

**Nothing flashy:** I like my cans like i like my coffee, black, and to the point - no frills. Example, the Sennheiser 280 HD Pros were one of my absolute favorite sets back in the day, but they had a bad wire weak point at the join.   
**Over ear fit**  
**Natural sound attenuation/blocking. Absolutely NO active or programmatic sound cancellation, gives me migraines for some reason.**  
**Need to be able to use with computer, and iphone.**



**Would like / to be considered as extras:**

**Good fit for smaller heads:** Listen, i'm not gonna sugar coat it, i've got a tiny head. Headphones that most people complain fit too tightly usually fit fair for me. It was one of the things that attracted me to the V-Modas, lots of guys said it felt like their head was in a vice, but for me they are perfection.   
**Closed Back:** Since i have transitioned to fully working at home, this is less of an issue as there's no one I can bother with sound leakage. However, it is my experience that open backed headphones also have far less natural sound blocking.   
**Left/Right wire placement flexibility:** My Vs have spoiled me in the ability to switch the wire to and from left/right placement. Good in preventing crossbody wire entanglements, especially with longer wires. 

  
I've been potentially considering Audio-Technica ATH-M50x pros, and using my old boom-mic attachment (Research indicates that my Vs boom-mic attachment *Should*  work for the M50x, but if that's incorrect please let me know.) There's also been the Logitech G Astro A50 X, but i'm not keen on battery operated or the entirely plastic build. Beyerdynamic 1900s also under consideration, but the mic aspect is especially tricky with them, believe I would have to get a standalone. The search has been rough, as there's more companies, options, and varieties and will admit to feeling overwhelmed. 

  
That absolute wall of text aside, I thank everyone for any suggestions they may have, and also reading the insane amount written. 

**TL;DR:** Need new headphones that can survive hulk smash, with near studio quality and microphone options. No active noise cancellation whatsoever. Acknowledge that what I want might simply just not exist at this time. Thanks!

We’re both at the stage of our lives where we’re thinking about moving out from our parents and looking for our own place to settle down. The issue is we can’t agree on a place to settle. He’s a city boy and grew up in Brighton so he’s very set on staying there. I however am a village girl and have my heart set on my village. 

He wants to be in Brighton for more job opportunities, close to the beach, close to pretty much everything and lots to do. I however want to be in my village as my entire family live here (my family is incredibly large) and I’ve always lived here my whole life. My partner isn’t fussed about being near his family as his family circle is very small and he’s not bothered about only visiting occasionally. I however am a massive family person and my family love to have BBQ, birthdays, Christmas, NYE all together. Being away from them would put a massive strain on all of that and I wouldn’t be able to pop in for a quick coffee with my cousins, aunts/uncles like I normally would. 

I also think my village is a more desirable area to raise a family. Lots of nature, good schools and friendly communities as well as very safe. Brighton being a main city means our children can’t go on spontaneous nature walks or go apple picking, quiet parks and other not so busy activities. My village is close to the town so going shopping or having to go out of the way for stuff wouldn’t be an issue. 

My partner thinks Brighton is more desirable as there’s more opportunities, everything is only a 5 minute walk, a major city and close to the beach. It’s also however more expensive and more noisy compared to village life. 

My partners most important concern is job opportunities while my most important concern is safety and suitability for children. I had a lovely childhood of bike riding, berry picking, wildlife watching etc and I want my children to have a similar experience in childhood. 

Has anyone had a similar experience and can weigh in on how we can manage this?


TLDR: partner and I can’t agree on a location to move. My village or Brighton. His concern is job opportunities while mine is safety and suitability for children ",2,1750058688.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Over the last 3/4 months now, my wife suddenly became so cold and absent. It wasn't a subtle at all. We were doing okay, not bad not great, but stable and okay.

She does not handle emotional conversations well, but I sat down with her telling her she felt a absent lately and she stated that she was not feeling like herself.

I was facing my own internal battle of suppressing my own needs for affection because she was never really available lately. Even so I asked how I could help her, and she said she needed more to do more around the house. She has a ""standard"" that not even she can keep up with, but I went nuts and kept things borderline immaculate for a couple months.

While doing this to support her needs, I was hoping she would meet me at my needs a little bit. This has not been the case, and it started to feel very lonely in the relationship because there was no real connection and I felt unseen. All I wanted was a deliberate thank you with a hug and a kiss, but she simply cannot meet me there (her words). She keeps saying time and space over and over.

After months of no reciprocation, my motivation began to wane. I wasn't getting her attention when waking up at 4am to help her get ready for work (such as getting her coffee) or keeping the house superb, but the second I slowed down, she made a comment about how she knew it wouldn't last and that crushed me.

When I told her that I can only serve so much before I need a little return, and she slammed me with having expectations and I shouldn't. To some degree I get this, but there has to be a little reciprocation. This escalated to her saying if I didn't stop engaging with her (except on her terms) she would leave.

She then said I was being manipulative when asking her if she wanted a divorce? When I asked if she wanted a room mate or a husband, again I'm manipulative. I've been struggling just being in the same home because she treats me like dog shit and when I tell her it's unacceptable, she replies with things like ""I am incapable of being nice right now."" But oddly that only applies to me, while her friends and coworkers get the sweet version of her.

I battle with myself everyday telling myself I deserve respect and affection as well. But my kids are older and are really heartbroken over this too. When I try to talk to my wife, the second she gets uncomfortable she starts screaming and my kids come running. It feels like she is weaponizing our kids because I won't argue in front of them.

Which method would you personally recommend? I do use skim milk, but I'm planning on having more than one cup of each in a day since it's winter, so I'd prefer to cut out the milk intake entirely.

They (7 girls) were friends with eachothers from highschool who reconnected around the time I joined. I'm not really good at making friends so I was happy they invited me for a coffee and added me to the group chat. We had a lot of fun and all grew closer. Or that's what I thought. I sometimes felt unheard, ignored, that I was part of the group but no individual relationships. That I was there just to be one more at parties. If I couldn't go to a coffee, it would never get cancelled. But if someone else couldn't go, it would be rescheduled for sure. They always said they were there for me but it didn't feel like that. 

I have a really bad situation at home and I suffer from very bad depression. I tend to isolate a lot due to this. This is not news for them, I talked about this several times, both the situation at home and my isolation issues.

This time it got worse for me. Since the year started I hate my mother so much because of how insane she is. I pretty much blame her for my depression and many other things that wouldn't have gone wrong if she was a mother, a supportive one in my life. I trauma dumped in the group chat, last message was me wishing her to die. I was also going through an almost 2 months period flow that  wouldn't stop and was messing with my body and mind (I been dealing with gyno stuff a lot lately). So I stopped posting on socials, checking and answering texts, etc.

It was not on purpose, when I noticed I was isolating again, and a month went by. I only received a few texts from them asking how I was (I didn't respond to them). They all live 5 min. walking from me. I didn't expect nothing but I couldn't avoid to notice how... little my dissappearing impacted them if that makes sense. I was in a really bad headspace and maybe a quick call from them would have made me feel appreciated. Or a visit. A coffee maybe?

I can't help it but feel bad because I went a month missing and if it wasn't cause of me, I could have been dead and no one of them would know. They thought a couple of texts asking were enough... 

I left the group chat without saying a word. I know I should have said something but I felt really unimportant. Also one of them (the only one who's a good friend) sent me a screenshot of them talking about what happened, and they immediately changed subjects to cat pictures in the middle of the chat. AIO? or they really don't care.

1lcmeub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1lcmeub/my_feelings_for_the_philippines/,My feelings for the Philippines,"Hello po! I'm a foreigner that usually visits the Philippines, because my partner is filipino, and that wants to reside there in the future, and I just wanted to express some thoughts and feelings about the Philippines.

  
I first visited in December 2022, and before that, I didn't know anything about the Philippines. I'm from Spain, so we know something about it from our history lessons at school, but we generally don't know anything about the current status of the country and its culture, other than it has really pretty beaches. But to me, what I found was a very layered interesting experience ever since I set foot in the country. The heat and warmth can be both felt in the weather and the people as soon as you step out of the plane. It's the only country I've seen that when you get out of the airport you're received by a huge crowd, and it makes you feel like a celebrity. But more than that, it makes you feel like you have a family there waiting for you, even if they don't know you yet. And everything about my experience every time I'm in the Philippines makes me feel like I'm at home. And because I stay with my partner's family everytime I go there, I got to experience the daily filipino life firsthand. I was able to experience the daily struggle, and it honestly gives much more value and credit to the fact that everyone's still nice to you, even after the countless hours they work for their family. I love the culture, the food, I love that Manila doesn't sleep and you can do anything at any time and people will still be out doing whatever and you can buy food or have a coffee in the night. And for the record, the beaches are not the prettiest thing I found in this country (even tho they are truly stunning), and Metro Manila is still the best place in the world for me. And it makes me sad that some foreigners don't have respect for filipinos sometimes. Some of them are entitled just because of their higher position, or they think they're coming to the Philippines like it's their own resort and people living there have to work for them and serve them, taking advantage of your hospitality. 

  
Last night, my partner and I watched ""And the Breadwinner Is..."" on Netflix, and it made my sentiment go even deeper. I understand the struggle that a lot of you have to go through and my heart is with your community. That's why we both felt like we have to help people when we're there in any way we can, since we're on a privileged position. We've always had this idea on our minds, but now it's been way reinforced after watching the movie.

  
Right now, because it's the best option for our future, we are staying in Spain until my partner finally gets his passport. After that, I've set my mind to move to the Philippines no matter what. And I'm quite worried about my job because I'll have to try to ask for a remote setup, and in case it doesn't work out, I'll have to quit it and look for something else. But as a software engineer, I have the hope to be able to do have that setup the soonest possible so I can live there without a problem, and keep on helping people in the country. We're still quite young so I know we will find our way over time. I'm even starting to pick up tagalog with my partner (I can understand like 60-70% of a normal conversation, but it's much harder to speak it hahaha).



And for anyone thinking I'm sugarcoating or romantizicing anything, I will say that of course there are bad things, and of course there are bad people too, but in comparison to where I come from (and Spain is even on the good extreme inside Europe), the ratio is much more inclined for the good people and the good experiences in this country in my case. And this is a post to reivindicate the hard work that a lot of people do for their family and their good heart. Please never change, and stay strong!!!

I tried everything and what finally worked,"I used to think bad breath just meant I wasn’t brushing well enough. But even with regular brushing, flossing, and mouthwash, I couldn’t figure out *how to stop bad mouth smell* from creeping back a few hours later. Mints helped for 10 minutes. Strong gums left a weird aftertaste. Nothing lasted.

Then I found some *Larineco gum reddit* threads where people said it didn’t just mask the smell - it helped fix the actual **cause** of bad breath. That was different from anything I’d heard before, so I gave **Larineco gum** a shot.

**What makes Larineco gum different?**

It’s not just minty gum. It’s made with **Xylitol** to kill odor-causing bacteria, **Mastic** to reduce plaque and support gum health, and **Nano Hydroxyapatite** to restore enamel and **neutralize acidic breath compounds**.

That combination helps prevent the buildup of bad breath at the source, not just hide it.

**Here’s where I ordered it**:  
[**Larineco Gum – Real Breath Freshness, No Cover-Ups**](https://getlarineco.com/bad-breath/?lpid=2530&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2530&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**Here’s what happened over 30 days**

**Week 1:**  
Dry mouth after meals was gone. That sticky, sour feeling never came back.

**Week 2:**  
My breath stayed fresher way longer. I didn’t need backup mints or a second gum every afternoon.

**Week 3:**  
My mouth just felt healthier. My tongue looked cleaner, and I wasn’t waking up with strong morning breath anymore.

**Week 4:**  
My dentist actually said my plaque was way lower than last visit - and my breath? No comments… which is a good thing.

**Here’s how it supports enamel and prevents future problems too**:  
[**Learn how Larineco gum helps protect your teeth**](https://getlarineco.com/repair-cavities/?lpid=2533&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2533&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt)

**Why I’m still using Larineco daily**

* Actually targets the bacteria behind bad breath
* Long-lasting freshness without fake mint overload
* Also helps with whitening and sensitivity
* Clean, natural ingredients
* Super easy to keep in your pocket or bag

**Final thoughts**

If you’re trying to figure out *how to stop bad mouth smell* without rinses, sprays, or gum that fades fast, **Larineco gum** is absolutely worth trying. It fixed the real problem for me and I haven’t looked back since.

So last month I got the flu. But here's the weird part my phone knew before I did. I was looking at my screen time data after I recovered and noticed something bizarre. Two days before I felt sick, my usage patterns completely changed. I was moving between apps way slower, kept checking the time like every 5 minutes, and my typing went to shit. Even my morning alarm got snoozed 3 times instead of my usual once. Made me curious so I started paying attention to what my devices actually notice. Turns out my running app figured out I drink coffee on days I run less than 3 miles but skip it when I plan longer runs. My laptop dims the screen 2 minutes before I usually take a break. Hell, even my smart TV learned I rewatch The Office when I'm stressed.

The funny thing is, once I noticed all this, I started using it to my advantage. My fitness tracker showing weird sleep patterns? Time to take it easy. Phone says I'm typing slower? Maybe I should grab that second coffee. Netflix recommending only comedies? Probably means I've been doom-scrolling too much lately. Not saying we should let tech run our lives or anything.

The Woods Eats The World



I was nearing my last straw when I’d come to work hungover again. It was early fall and what was meant to be my second year in school was just beginning. I didn’t want to think about it. 

My head was spinning as I clocked in and leaned over the counter, looking across the store at all of the canned goods, drink machines and the like. My eyes latched onto a can opener on one of the cheap plastic shelves, sitting beside a few cans of beans. I almost scoffed, but instead my throat closed up on itself and I could feel something bubbling up inside of my head…tears. I was about to cry and I had to turn quickly away from the sales floor. 

I leaned backwards now, with my eyes now set on a poster behind the counter. It pictured a college student standing with books in hand, grinning wildly. I grunted and stooped into the break room where my boss was sitting. He didn’t look up, he only lifted a finger from the binder he was going through.

“Kurt,” He started in his grumbly voice. I froze.

“You fucked up again, kid.”

I didn’t say anything.

“I thought we talked…you can’t keep coming in here clinging to dear life.”

Then he looked up at me and grimaced.

“Jesus, Kurtis, you’re not even trying anymore, are you? Shit, what even happened?”

I looked away to try and hide my disheveled appearance. 

“I…uh…I’m sorry, it won’t ha--”

“Yes, it will. It’s gonna keep happening until you’re dead in the ground with a rotten liver, just like ol’ pop-pop.”

I couldn’t respond to that. 

“Fuck, don’t just stand there like a lost dog, go home. I don’t wanna see you until you look halfway sober. Hell, I can’t even recognize you anymore.”

I didn’t have anything else to say or do, so I left. I went back to my miserable apartment and sulked. I poured myself a couple of shots and I was out like a light.

	But the phone rang. It must have been going for a while by the time I opened my eyes. I was laying on my couch in my own filth, but it didn’t faze me anymore. Somehow I’d stopped even caring how any of this made me feel. 

I grabbed around on the coffee table until I found my phone and mindlessly answered it.

“Mmm…hello?”

My voice was shot.

“Kurt?” 

Caleb’s voice was like a terrible, beautiful song to my ears.

“Oh, hey, man.” I sat up slowly, clutching the back of the couch.

“Are you…doin’ okay, man?”

“Uh, yeah, yeah. I’m just…tired from uh…studying.” 

There was a pause and I had the horrible feeling that Caleb knew I was bullshitting him. He was always smart about that stuff.

“Don’t lie to me, Kurt. It’s fine, I get it. I was never good with school, either. You remember.”

He chuckled softly and I felt a short burst of elation from his words. Someone was finally understanding.

“Anyway, don’t explain. I have something important to tell you.”

I was all ears. It seemed as if Caleb’s voice had shaken me out of whatever stupor I was in and I was instantly intrigued.

“I did it.”

Was all he said at first. I wasn’t sure what he meant for exactly two seconds, but then, in the pause between words, I completely understood.

“No.”

“Yes.”

“Oh.”

More silence. Time was frozen. I could only wonder how he pulled this off. Into The Wild.

“I don’t know, man. It’s nice. I mean, of course it is, this is what I was made for.”

“You’re in Salmon Challis?”

I asked quickly.

“Where else?” His voice was upbeat and almost whimsical. 

“How long…”

“I’m not ever going back. I’m not, don’t even ask me. I can’t even tell you how good this feels.”

“So…why are you calling me…?”

“Because I need you.”

I scoffed.

“You…need me?”

“Yes, I need you.”

His voice started cutting out.

“There’s bad reception out here but when this call is up I’m destroying this phone.”

His words shocked me to my core. I was lost, confused, and terrified. He sounded so serious about it, so certain. I should have known he wasn’t done with his outdoors shit, how could he be? It was always a part of him.

“Okay, what do you need from me?”“I need you to help me. I know this is a big ask but I wouldn’t call if I didn’t think you could do it.”

“Help with…?”“Supplies, food. Preservations, you know. You wouldn’t have to leave the city, you could just…come out every few months and bring me stuff. Of course I’ll be moving camp every so often so I’m not discovered, but…this is the only way I know how to do this, and you’re my best friend. Put it this way, you’ll be saving my life. Keeping me safe. Feeding me.” He paused for just a moment and added, 

“You’ll take the main hiking trail up to Red Rock Point. There’s an abandoned ranger’s cabin at the top of the hill from there.”



I hung up after giving him a short, ‘I’ll think about it.’

And I did. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, actually. I didn’t go to work the next day, or for my next scheduled shift. As far as I was concerned, I could be fired and tossed into the fiery depths. I was done with this city, this sad and pathetic attempt at a life I sought before my overpowering guilt and self pity took hold. 

That call is what really sent the rest of my life in motion. I wasn’t old, I wasn’t even close. I was a broke, drunken twenty one year old with nowhere to go and this magical voice from years past had just asked me to ‘save his life,’ as he put it. At the time I hadn’t even thought about the odd part at the end of our conversation, where he’d added a second time that I would feed him.

It knew he wasn’t coming home, I knew I could never ask him to and I also knew that I couldn’t let his parents know.

Of course, a part of me thought for the next while or so that I should let the Marshs’ know where he had gone, but another part of me, the part that loved Caleb and explored with him for most of my life, that I could not let him down. I couldn’t let anyone else down again. This was my chance at redemption, my chance at moving forward and at trying something new.

I left the city that week.



The last thing I wanted to do was come clean to my parents. They had been under the impression that I was still doing well. When they called I would tell them that I was enjoying school and that everything was fine. I’d even added details about the girls I’d seen in my classes or at parties and when they responded with such excitement I became too trapped in their manufactured pride in their only son that I just didn’t have the heart to let them down.

At this point, I knew I had to say something.

	When I’d gotten onto the bus headed home with all of my belongings, I didn’t even turn around one last time to say goodbye to the city. I wasn’t too entirely attached to care if I never saw it again. 

The leaves were just beginning to leave the trees and with my head against the cold window, I watched the world pass by me and tried not to think of the little town that was quickly approaching with unwavering arms. 

Of course I didn’t tell anyone I was leaving, I couldn’t have my parents freaking out about their poor son falling off the wagon. Still, I wasn’t sure how I would approach the subject once I’d made it home.



	I decided to stage a visit. If I was going to lie to a degree such as this, I might as well go all or nothing. As the bus weaved through the little town, I gazed around at all of the familiar surroundings. The fishing shop, the local goods and the little brick library were almost comforting to me if it wasn’t for my impending circumstance. I began kicking myself for not planning this out better. I could have told them I was coming home to visit, or anything like that but it was too late now.

I walked quickly through the bus terminal and around the corners until I reached my neighborhood. With my bags in hand and my face bare in the brisk autumn wind, I set forth to my demise.



I rang the doorbell once and my other came crashing through the door, calling my father to come outside. She must not have seen the state I was in when she hugged me tightly, and I loosely wrapped my arms around her back. My father walked through the corridor and up to the doorframe, his face almost dropping when he’d seen me. He must have taken notice fairly quickly of my appearance and I could see something in his eyes that I’d always feared: disappointment. 



	I ended up staying for dinner and talking half-heartedly about my college escapades, all the while my mother kept close and tender eyes on me. I hated lying to her. I told them I was just visiting and that it was my weekend off. I didn;t say a word about Caleb or the things that I’d left behind in the big city. As far as they knew I was going right back to school after my surprise visit.



Friday into Saturday I layed low. I decided to stay for the weekend, telling them both that I would be heading back into the city early Monday morning. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do when that time came, but I couldn’t think that far ahead.

My mom went to work and my dad was busy with his hardware job. I was packing everything I could into my suitcase, trying to find every little thing I needed to give to Caleb out there in the woods. A pillow, a hunting knife, cans of soup and beans, socks, scarves, gloves and, to top it all off, a can opener.

I was ready by the time Monday morning graced me with its heat through my window. When I was laying in bed I almost felt like a child again, waiting for another big adventure with Caleb the madman. For a moment, I was thirteen and nervous. My stubble which was threatening to grow into something more questionable was simply a phantom sensation on my face, and my heavy mind felt lighter the more I indulged in this fantasy. 

But, as I was sitting up and gathering my things to head up into the forest behind our little town, my father came into the room. He looked like he knew something and I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible.

“Kurt,” He muttered gruffly. When he sat down I realized just how a child sees their parents. He never really seemed to change from when I was a kid, but he had changed in so many ways. The lines around his mouth and forehead were far deeper and the skin around his cheeks and neck was beginning to sag. I tried not to think about it.

“Hey, dad.” 

“Heading back today?” 

I glanced around the room anxiously.

“Uh, yeah.”

He sighed and there was something to his presence that was daunting.

He put a firm hand on my shoulder.

“Son, I want you to know how very proud I am of you, my boy. Truly.”

I just stared at him, dazed.

“And I think…your mother is very worried about you.”

I didn’t respond. He scoffed and shook his head, looking across the room.

“I mean, we worry. After all, you’re all we’ve got. I just want you to know that we care about you, son. If you ever need anything, you just give us a call.”

I started to stand when he gripped my forearm and sat me back down on the bed. My heart thudded and my throat was closing up. Then he leaned in and hugged me; a real fatherly hug. I could feel his compassion from the tightness in his hands around my shoulders. I felt so angry…angry at myself for becoming such a terrible son. A liar, a failure. Something in me knew at that moment, with my father’s arms wrapped tightly around my body that he wasn’t as stupid as I thought he may have been this weekend…he knew I wasn’t going back to school. But I wasn’t about to have that conversation.

	Before he left the room to go to work, when I was finally ready to gather my things and leave for Salmon Challis, he stopped in the doorway.

“You haven’t heard from the Marshes', have you?”

My heart dropped. I just stared with wide eyes until I was able to lie straight into his face again. Why did he say “The Marshes’?” Of course I don’t talk to Caleb’s parents. I sighed.

“No, we don’t really talk anymore.”

“Ah, I see. Well Caleb’s mother says she has you in her thoughts. ” He muttered and closed the door behind him. 

That didn’t make any sense. Why would she have me in her thoughts when she has a whole son of her own to worry about? I tried to let the confusion subside and think about heading out to meet my best friend in the woods.



I wasn’t the best hiker when I was a kid, even when I’d run off into the forest with Caleb.

But alas, there I stood with my bag in hand, staring down at the main hiking trail through Salmon Challis National Forest like the barrel of a gun. 

It might as well have been such. I put one foot in front of the other and started my hike through the main trail. It was wide and rather populated, with fellow hikers nodding in my direction and shooting grins between clenched teeth.

Some of them looked at me funny; having a massive duffle bag on wheels. Pulling it around was a pain but I got used to the feeling after a while. I was still a strong man, no matter how I saw myself. 

I must have stopped three or four times before I reached a breakage in the trees where a small creek was running. I sat on a rock with my knees pulled up to my chin and took a few swigs from a water bottle. The chill fall air had become normal to me and I wasn’t even bothered anymore. The sun was glistening through the spaces between leaves and branches above me and the sound of running water somehow warmed my heart. I felt free. I didn’t even think about school or the city, it was almost as if all of that was just a terrible dream. 

	I was caught off guard by a forest critter bobbing along leisurely through some thickets ahead. At first I thought it was a raccoon, but upon further inspection I realized I was looking at a giant badger walking past me from across the creek in heavy strides. For a moment it stopped and it must have seen me, and for about twenty seconds straight I stared right into its big black eyes while it stared into mine. 

Then he kept trucking along to his next destination, forgetting all about me.



It felt like I was out there all day on the main trail before I saw any kind of refuge or Redwood Point. But, as the sun began to set and the fellow hikers had all but faded, I caught sight of a crooked wooden sign nailed into a tree. I really felt alone again. There was no one around here, and I realized that Redwood Point must be some kind of barren wasteland for hikers. 

I grunted and read the sign out loud.

“Redwood.” 

I remembered what Caleb had said; there’s a hill ahead, and an abandoned ranger’s cabin. That’s where I’d be staying, whether Caleb knew that part or not. I didn’t have anywhere else I wanted to be, or anywhere I *could* be. There was no going back to the city and there was no going back home to live with ma and pa. This was it.

There was an incline in the trees ahead and I clocked that it must have been the hill. I wiped my brow and started trudging uphill, breaking off the path and through the thick and heavy forest floor. The cabin was certainly there, nestled at the top of the hill. It was shrouded in bushes and fallen branches, completely masked in caked crispy leaves.

I breathed in and smelled what I can only imagine as being death. Death of nature, the reset of everything once green and vivid in this forest. With every step I took toward the cabin, I felt leaves crunching beneath my boots. 

The cabin was old, very old. It must have been a post for rangers back in the eighties and there’s an old painted sign on the side of the frail wooden door that barely read: POST SEVEN. That must have meant there were more of those old things. I glanced around at the dying forest around me and sighed. I opened the door with a slight kick and it moved backward with a cracking noise. I glanced around once more and then stepped inside. I was able to call this home, for now. Of course, I would go back into town for reinforcements, ie: food and provisions of my own and for Caleb, but here I would stay for most of the time.

A quick and reluctant thought sunk into my mind before I could whisk it off, and it was one that I knew needed answering: How long? How long did Caleb want me to do this for him, and how long would I be a hermit in this strange forest? I decided it didn’t matter. If there is one thing I’ve learned since going off to college it’s that you should never plan too far ahead. Everything changes without you even realizing it and all of the plans that you’ve held so close and waited around for never really happen, and instead your world is turned into something horrifically different from what you pictured. And so, I decided against taking that reluctant thought any further and gave it no weight. I was here, and that was all that mattered. I had my phone, (which would be out of service out here and the plan I had on it would certainly run out) and I had just enough money for at least a few months, but that didn’t bother me in the moment. This was my life now.



	The first time I saw Caleb in those woods was the day after I arrived. I had managed to set up a little makeshift bed in the cabin and was starting to get comfortable. Somehow I was completely okay with where I was. No one could see me and I really had no responsibilities other than Caleb, and that wasn’t too much. I even went for a short walk in the morning around the more populated parts of the forest. I almost got myself lost but I managed to find my way back to Redwood Point. I was strangely content on that first day. The sun was shining through the trees and I had enough of my own food to myself. Of course I was going to go back into town but only when I really needed to. 

It was when I had been sitting outside the cabin, looking down the slope below me that I heard footsteps approaching from the other side of the cabin. 

Caleb had come nearly frolicking around the corner to greet me. I stood up quickly when I noticed him and my heart began to flutter. 

He was dressed in a thick coat and scarf, though the sun was rather warm. His hair had grown out but I noticed right away that he had some balding spots around his hairline and the top of his head. He looked pale, and almost…old. I shrugged off the odd appearance; we’d both grown up over the past few years and some people get there faster than others. I supposed I didn’t look so good, either. He didn’t seem to mind as he grinned widely at me, showing a set of yellow teeth. He never cared much for hygiene.

“You did it.” He said, beaming. 

I nodded awkwardly.

“Yep, I sure did.”

A short pause. I hitched in a tight breath while I stared at him. It was almost unbelievable that I was here in this forest with him again. Still, a part of me understood that it made all the sense in the world. 

“This is…ah. This is great.” Caleb sighed and looked around him. I was still examining his appearance. I’d almost forgotten what he’d looked like after all of this time and I was almost convinced I’d forgotten entirely; he didn’t look how I remembered him to look. Still, I knew in my heart that this was my old friend. How could it not be?

We exchanged small talk for some time before he explained to me that this was to be a serious, transactional relationship from henceforth and that he would only come to the cabin when and if he needed food and other things. I agreed and gave him whatever I had brought along with me to give. He took it and headed out. He’d asked me very sternly not to ask where he would be going. I understood and watched his balding head bobbing away through the trees ahead. I was alone again, until I decided to go into town. 

I had been out there for about a week before I decided to head back into town, making sure to avoid my parents’ places of work. I had just enough money from my old job in the city to afford some more food and energy drinks. Walking through the town with no obligation to be there was truly a new and incredible sensation. I could leave whenever I wanted and I could stay for as long as I liked. 

	The peace and quiet was at first a gift, but it slowly became a curse. I’d begun journaling by the creek and watching wildlife intently. I started charting down all of the animals that I’d seen and even giving them names. Sometimes I felt as if I’d been going crazy, but quickly decided that I was perfectly okay with that.

Sandra was a deer that I’d seen more than twice by the creek. I could tell it was her by a scar on her left side, starting at her neck and ending near her tail. She was an odd looking Whitetail. Once I sat on my rock by the waterside at twilight, watching intently as she cautiously stepped into the clearing with her ears flapping and her tongue swishing back and forth. She seemed to look at me and I mouthed a short ‘hello.’ I could have sworn she nodded at me, slowly and with a kind of purpose that I couldn’t determine. She always came closer to me when she suspected I had something for her to eat, like an old half-frozen sandwich. I’d feed her sometimes and I guess that’s why she just kept coming back.

The next (and last time) I saw her was one early morning when she had sauntered near the cabin. I stuck my head out of the window and watched her. Her right ear was missing entirely, almost as if it had never been there. She looked as if she was falling apart, with clots of fur that I’d found around the creek and the cabin for weeks after.

I was a true survivor man, just like Caleb. Sure, I was hungry as all hell and I needed to get back into town, but I was out of money. Everything that I had was for Caleb’s next visit and I knew that I needed to get a part time job in the city. Or, if worse came to worst, I’d have to subject myself to begging on the streets. That would be a first.

It was getting colder and my little makeshift bed was keeping me warm less and less. Most nights I pulled my hat over my face and struggled to breathe, and in the early mornings I would be shivering so aggressively I thought I was having convulsions. I hadn’t run into any strange hikers in the woods asking for food, but I suppose Sandra was weird enough.

Caleb showed up again when the first of the snow was beginning to fall in the forest. He was wearing less than he had been wearing last time, with just a tight windbreaker and a pair of jeans on. He was so thin it startled me. The Caleb I’d known so many years ago was certainly no more. He looked as if he’d been eating nothing but berries and leaves. But, more than anything, he looked so, so happy.

I invited him inside the cabin but he refused. He was happy, sure, but he was also persistent that I shouldn’t be so friendly.

“I mean, it’s not like we’ve been friends our whole lives, Caleb.” I joked as I handed him a plastic bag full of provisions. 

He didn’t respond to my remark, he just took the bag. After a moment of silence between us I shivered and looked around. Then Caleb spoke.

“I don’t think I’ll need you anymore.”

His words struck me hard in the center of my chest.

“Uh…what?”

“Yeah, I don’t know. I think I’m better off alone.”

“I mean…you are alone, aren’t you? We barely even see each other as it is.”

“Yeah, I don’t think you should stay. I’m sorry I dragged you into this.”

*Dragged me into this?* This was my life now, not just his. I grit my teeth and clenched and unclenched my fists.

Before he walked away I grabbed his sleeve and when I did, he pulled back aggressively and almost growled at me. It shocked me and I jumped back.

“You need to go home, Kurt. I don’t want to see you again.”

He stated clearly before smiling. His teeth had all but rotted by now and his lips were so white and thin it was like they weren’t even there. He reminded me of the sickly deer who had vanished entirely. Was his ear going to fall off, too?

“I don’t want to hurt you, you need to go.”

Then Caleb did something strange. He started walking away…backwards. He was still staring at me, but his smile had faded into a fine slit below his nose. He walked as if he knew exactly what was behind him, like he was walking forward with his head twisted fully around…it was so unnatural. I couldn’t help but stand and watch him in peril.

“So…so that’s it, huh? We’re done?”

Silence, just the image of a backwards walking Caleb. It was almost comedic.

“Wait, remember Allison?!”

I almost screamed it as a last resort before he faded from my life entirely. I was so confused, hungry, cold, scared. This was the only thing I had left in my life. If I could shake him out of this increasingly disturbing state, I would have to pull out the big guns.

He stopped. I took a step forward, confident but unsure of where I was going with this. I just wanted him to stay.

“Yeah, Allison. The one who killed herself?”

I was appalled at how casually he said it, as if he never knew her at all. I hitched in a breath and prepared myself for my speech.

“And…and I blamed myself for it all this time, all these years…I saw her scars and I didn’t say anything!” Tears were breaking out of my eyes and my voice was shaking.

“And I thought that when you called me and you wanted me to do all of this…that I could make up for it! For not saving her, for not helping. I wanted to save you, Caleb! This is…all I have left.” 

I almost fell to my knees in astonishment at myself. I was shaking so much and my breath was tight. Caleb just stared with his newly dead eyes.

“I don’t know who Allison is.”

He said in a monotone voice. My legs crumbled beneath me and I landed hard on my knees, my mouth agape and eyes stained with tears as I watched him walk out of view, still backwards.

Mondays... We've All Been There! 😴  
Ah, Monday. That familiar feeling of the weekend slipping away and the weight of the week looming. We get it! It's okay to feel a little draggy after a good weekend.  
But here's the thing: you've got this! 💪 You just spent a couple of days doing things you love, recharging your batteries, and filling your cup. Tap into that positive energy!  
Think of it like this: the weekend was like a supercharged battery pack for your soul. Now, let's use that power to tackle the week! 🚀  
Here are a few tips to get you started:  
\* Start small: Don't try to conquer the whole week at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.  
\* Reward yourself: Plan a small reward for getting through the day. It could be anything from a cup of coffee to a few minutes of meditation.  
\* Remember your weekend wins: Take a moment to reflect on the positive experiences you had over the weekend. Let those good vibes fuel your Monday.  
You've got this! Let's make this Monday a productive and awesome one. ✨",1,1750057303.0,3AMALONE,0,1.0,False

Chapter 11 

*Stal marched to his doom with his head high. One would expect a warrior who had lost a battle to be jeered through the corridors as he went to meet his fate, but everyone knew what had happened. His failure was not his fault, but it was still his failure. The lead warriors in the Mother Ship had chosen not to execute him out of hand, but he suspected that was as much to make him - rather than themselves - face The Elder as any other reason.*

*Their decree had been correct, however, and allowed him to meet his fate with honor in tact: He had saved many warriors with his resolve, intelligence, and quick action… even before taking into account how he’d fought to cover the retreat.*

*Still, everyone knew he wouldn’t leave The Elder’s presence alive. He would, however, meet his fate like a warrior, and look her in the eyes when she pulled the trigger. The doors to her chamber slid open, and he marched to her cradle-like support chair with no fear in his eyes.*

*He thought to himself, again, how she resembled the ancient Human enemies, the ones who herded them into the guns of the despised Xaltans nearly a dozen generations ago, but he dismissed the thought. It didn’t matter. Only his failure mattered, and meeting his death with honor.*

*He got near to the chair – close enough that even her frail hand could aim easily at his head and give him a painless end – and knelt. After the ritual greeting he explained his failure, the valiant struggle of his men, and even that he’d been forced to leave bodies behind in the Void.*

*The Ancient one listened, unblinking, the tubes which kept her alive continuing to… do whatever unsettling things they did. He finished, and those barely-seeing eyes turned to him, and seemed to burn through his skull. Her voice came out clear. “So, the Humans laid an ambush for you and your warriors, and you met with real, military, armed resistance?”*

*He simply nodded.*

*“Show me.”*

*Puzzled, but obedient, Stál looked to the floor and saw video controls had been projected. He set the video to start at the first contact with the enemy, and let it play. The Ancient watched with interest as he began to hear fire, then to see muzzle flashes.*

*A Human appeared on the screen, and the Ancient hit a control on her chair. The video froze, and she worked her magic over it. It looked a little more clear when she finished, and then the picture of the Human expanded. He expected to see her focus on the enemy’s face, but she focused on a patch on his shoulder, then some markings on the side of his chest.*

*After a few moments of this she waved her hand and the hologram disappeared. The Ancient then turned those hard eyes on him.*

*‘This is it’ Stál thought to himself, and readied himself for his end.*

*She smiled. A hard, cold smile, which went as far as the edge of her lips and brought no light to her eyes; she then spoke a single word.*

*“Good.”*

*Stál looked at her and blinked rapidly. “I don’t understand.”*

*Her smile widened a little, but somehow seemed even more cold. “You have done well, my warrior. You got most of your fighters out alive, and killed more Humans than we lost. You have also provoked them, so now they have turned attention to us, and we can fight them properly!” She then hit another button, and a hologram showing assembled Tómamenn all across their Home staring at her. He knew they looked at projections of the Ancient, and wondered if he showed up in them.*

*She looked up and spoke in an imperious one. “My people, the time has come! The Humans have recognized us as a threat, and brought their soldiers to fight us! They will learn, now, what they discarded. They will learn what they left to the guns of the Xaltans, and they will feel our pain.*

*“No longer will we be restrained to use the technologies and weapons devised Before. Now, we will bring our full wrath to bear against our enemies: The Xaltans, and the Humans, and will feel our pain!”*

*A single tear fell from Stál’s eye. ‘I will not only survive, but bear the standard against our enemies!’ In his heart, the cheers felt like they were for him and his glorious destiny.*

\*

Julia threw herself into her work, even as she tried to savor the time with her parents. The next few weeks passed in a blur: Trade deals, social occasions, Council sessions (where she took copious notes), neutral party for other Ambassadors, meetings with the Pinigra; whatever she could find to do, she tackled with a will. At the same time, she tried to spend every possible moment with her parents.  She knew they’d leave far too soon, and feared for them, so she found herself torn between existential worry and trying to squeeze ever possible moment with them.

The seemed to understand, and made sure that their time together was filled either with family activities – she hadn’t played so many board games since they’d traveled when she was a kid – or talk of work.

The last day before their departure came all too soon, however. She slept fitfully, at best, her dreams filled with serious-faced people in military uniforms coming to inform her of the fate of her parents. The worse were the ones who told her it was her fault, that she should have…

Her eyes opened and she almost flinched, expecting the dread which had been building on her to crash into her mind like a tidal wave. Instead, she felt calm. *Not sure if the nightmares worked the dread through my system, if I’m numb to the situation, or this is a state of acceptance.*

*Well, whatever the cause, might as well use the time.* A long, luxurious, meditative bath seemed to help more, and put her self-assessment out of the ‘numb’ category.

She entered her office to find Kessler waiting, and what she assumed would be her a cup of her favorite coffee sitting on her desk. The Dr. lifted his own cup to her as if in toast as she sat and took a heart-warming sip. She then looked up and quirked one eyebrow and a half-smile, inviting him to speak.

He nodded. “We have the first tests in from the Genome mapping projects, and we have found a few things. Mostly preliminary results, some of which we may never be able to solidly prove, but… a lot of it is both tantalizing and terrifying, though some does provide a little hope.

“Probably the most encouraging  item is that most no longer believe that the Old Machines ‘seeded’ the worlds of our Galaxy with life: there are too many life-forms which don’t bear evidence of their tampering, and so the theory that they tampered with the primordial soup of thousands of world in order to ‘push’ evolution towards hominid sapient beings is pretty much broken.”  
Julia cocked her head. “Well, it is nice to know that the Old Machines aren’t Virtual Gods who can direct hundreds of millions of evolution with a single nudge, but that puts us back to not having an explanation for the clustering we see through the cycles, nor the apparent preference for Hominid species… Oh, no, wait…”

Kessler put a finger to the side of his nose. “Yes, their interventions started much more recently: certainly less than ten million years ago, possibly even half of that. Furthermore, it seems that sapient species are evolving in sections of the galaxy not just in groups, but *with precision*.

“Given that we see plenty of evidence of tampering on most species – those which lead to sapients or not – on every world we find, along with the aforementioned facts, makes it pretty clear…”

Julia interrupted. “That the Old Machines are constantly messing with the biomes and genetics of very world in the Galaxy, forcing the evolution of sapients to adhere to their clusters and their time-frames. Still, it is all so… arbitrary! What kind of sick f…”

Kessler shrugged. “We are seeing possible evidence of results, maybe even some of the methods. As for the reasoning and motivation: We still don’t’ have anything.

“There are two things, however, which I think you will find of interest. First, the Old Machines seem to *stop* interfering well before any given race actually reaches sapience.” He held up a hand at her furrowed brow. “I know, I know, that is the sort of thing you’d expect to come after years of careful analysis, not one of the first results. The reason is terribly complicated, but my understanding at a high level is that they wouldn’t have been able to make the determination if not for the fact that they had billions of samples from each of the League races.”

He waved a hand around in a vague fashion. “Something about pinpointing particular changes, genetic drift over time rates, and a bunch of other things.

“The second thing is one you will find even more interesting, I think, and that is the one League race that is – probably – an exception to that rule. Not only do they appear to have had edits made post-sapience, but they have more edits to their genome than any other race in the League.”

Julia cocked her head slightly, and waited for Kessler to answer. He just sat there, that odd smile on his face, and looked at her, as if daring her to figure it out. Part of her felt irritation and wanted to tell him to spit out the answer, but a hint of a challenge lay in his eyes, and her desire to meet that challenge outweighed – or was spurred on by – her irritation.

The answer hit her in a flash, and felt like a brick to the head. “The Roranar! The culture, the triple-evolution on three planets, the history-without-possibility-of-history with the Pinigra…” Her eyes narrowed. “And, the Pinigra know, or they know something. It is time we pay another visit to those birds. I will need you to come with me this time. I presume you have all those reports on a crystal?”

He nodded, and she paged her parents. By the time they entered ‘The Roost’, as they’d started to call it, she’d briefed them, and her Dad bore a very determined expression; One which Mom tried, without much success, to soften. For herself, she didn’t particularly want it softened, but Mom understood how people reacted to Dad better than she did, she had to admit. He was Figure Of Legend second to her, Dad first… and she was all to aware how that could color her perceptions.

Everimal met them at the door, and brought them inside while he made small talk about physics discoveries and Human music he’d found interesting. By the time they’d taken their normal seats in the mall conversation area, the man seemed to realize that their visit would not be routine. He looked back and forth between them and spoke. “I am going to assume that something has happened, or more information has been gained, regarding the Old Machines. I also surmise that this means you intend to press me about matters which I have been… reluc…”

Dad waved a hand to cut the man off, hit a button, and a hologram of a gift basket hovered in the air. “You mentioned once that you would be very interested in seeing this basket, and that you could interpret the contents. You will find that this hologram is fully interactive, and that you can take each item out, examine it, and see what else was under it.”

Evermal stood, took a good look at the basket from several angles, sighed, sat, and shook his head a little. “I could draw this out, explain what each item here is, what it means, and why it is placed just so. However, I assume that there was something in the note besides what you have already told me? Something along the lines of ‘If you ever need something from one of my kind, show them a picture of this basket’?”

1lcm2bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATstudy/comments/1lcm2bq/my_2_cents_to_people_joining_their_mba/,My 2 cents to people joining their MBA,"

[Written by a senior (not me). Reposting for better reach]

A batch of 2024 passout here. 

1. Prepare well for your placements. If you don't have workex, do some internships, or whatever you can to fill up your CV with keywords before you join your MBA. Everything is all fun and happiness in those 2 years, but if you don't end up with a good job, many of us won't look at those times with affection.


 
2. Even if you don't have a profile good enough for getting into consulting, still prepare case studies and guesstimates. They for sure will increase your knowledge, structure your thinking and teach you excellent verbalisation of your thoughts. Read Case in Point till page 100.


  
3. Don't join your MBA without a good Master CV and having all the failures, achievements, learnings, PORs and impact of whatever you've done in your grad, school, personal life, workex and internships. This will save you 10x efforts while preparing your CV and batch profile as well as you'll already have answers to 80% of the HR questions.



4. Shortlists for summers and finals are a very random process. So don't get disheartened of all your homies and girls get good shortlists but you don't. You'll soon get one too. All you can do is prepare a good CV and then hope for the best. You CANNOT target a shortlist. That's not how it works. However if you are fixated on a company, you can do your fucking absolute best in its case competition and get a PPI. 



5. Unless you want to get in the Dean's merit list or something, MBA grades don't really matter. Just don't fail anything. Anything above 7.5 is okay



6. The people around you decide what kind of 2 years you'll have. Trust me, you become an average of the people you spend your time most with. So find out good people and stick to them. 
  


7. Be kind and polite and do a couple of things for those around you. Create a sense of reciprocity.  
 



8. If the golden rule is ""Do to people what you'd like to be done to you"" then the platinum rule is that ""Do to people what they'd like to be done to them"".
 


9. Be respectful and talk well to people. Looks for sure matter, but not as much as we think they do and they're just an entry level criteria. 
  


10. MBA is that time when you may or may not have money, but you have all the freedom you want. Make good use of it. 



11. About s*x, I know a lot of us go into BSchools hoping that we'd get a lot of it. True, you can get a lot of it, given you look somewhat decent and have a good personality. However the irony is that after you do get a lot of casual s*x, you'll realise that casual s*x is not what you want. S*x as a form of communicating the love you have for someone is everything you need.  
 


12. Relationships. Be clear about what you want: whether its something serious or casual or whether you don't have clarity. Be honest and communicate this to the potential partners you might be having. I've seen people giving false commitments and then withdrawing, leaving the other person broken beyond repair. Do not cheat. Don't hurt anyone, because trust me, when the hurt person has the last laugh, you'll be walking out of college with 0 credibility and respect. Have seen this happening very recently in my BSchool. Remember: DO NOT SH*T WHERE YOU EAT.   



13. Draw clear boundaries with people, and stick to them. What makes you uncomfortable, communicate about it. 
 


14. Have a healthy relationship with alcohol, smoking and all other stuff. I know a lot of parties do happen and a lot of such stuff happens in them, but don't over abuse it. Alcohol fu*ks you up by fu*king up your health, your relationships and everything. A very close friend of my ex, who were IIM passouts in 2022 was engaged in multiple casual relationships at the institute, heavily drank, smoked and smoked up. Last year, she tried to kill herself by popping some pills. We saved her, but this is what overdoing things can lead to. 




15. Not everyone is worth the effort. You'll find some people who are extremely selfish and will take a lot from you, but show their true colours when it becomes inconvenient for them. They will have 0 reciprocity. Instead of wasting your time on such people, focus on the ones you want to keep forever. However DO NOT burn your bridges.




16. People won't remember you for the gpa you got or the placement you got. They'll remember you for how you made them feel. So be a good person, be kind and very polite. Create a sense of debt in people. You never know which company you might want to get referred to in the future :)  
 


17. Your health is extremely important: both mental and physical. Visit your campus therapist and keep exercising. Keep your room pleasent and clean. 
  


18. Be very clear about money. It is the biggest factor that spoils relationships. Make splitwise your best friend. Talk to your circle and decide whether you'll be adding the 18 rupees sutta, 20 rupees coffee, 50 rupees auto kind of expenses to your splitwise. Because with time, the law of averages catches up and you all end up spending more or less equally on these miscellaneous expenses. But if only 1 or 2 people pay all the time, the amount unaccounted for can  reach in 10000s by the end of 2 years. So be clear about this.



19. Use the CATS principle: Compliment, appreciate, thank, sorry. People who speak well do get an unfair advantage. Also, the quality of your network matters, not the quantity. 



20. Learn about your summer internship company and if you do want to continue full time with it, give your best for a PPO. A PPO makes your second year extremely chill. Remember, getting a PPO is more about how you gel with your boss and the team. So be polite and respectful there as well. You may or may not achieve all your deliverables in the project, but what kind of relationship you had with the coworkers plays a large part in getting a PPO. The organisation where I was working at gave PPOs to 10 out of 13 people from by BSchool. The other 3 people had arguments a few times with their managers.  



21. Get out of your comfort zone or your MBA will be just another 2 years of your life. A moment outside the comfort zone leads to a story for life. I took that leap of faith and now I'm a completely different person than what I was when I joined. 



Finally, be humble, respect everyone and gaand faad maje karo. You'll never have such kind of resources to spend ever again (one or 
more out of money, time, energy). 
All the very best 💯❤️💞🧿




P.S: Other people are welcome to add their own suggestions   


Addition 1: Even in the best BSchools, there are always a few kids who struggle to get shortlists initially and get depressed. For 95% of the new batch, there is a tight slap that brings them back to reality from the bubble of getting into a top institute, and that is summers. If CAT XAT prep is 10, GD PI WAT prep is 100 then placement prep is 150. However I'll say it again. Don't dwell too much on shortlists. Keep doing your preparation. Me, with a 9/6/8 profile got shortlists of companies paying 3-4 lac+ stipends and got into one of those. I was shit scared when I didn't get shortlists considering my 6 and low workex and thought anything with a stipend of 50000 would be good. 

Addition 2: Tell your grad profs, ex bosses at work and internships that you'll be seeking their approval for some CV points. If your BSchool just requires the domain of your ex company in the approval email, try to get your good friends/ ex colleagues at work to approve your points. That way thoda badha chadha bhi sakte ho, but don't lie and exaggerate so much that you won't be able to defend it if asked about it in interviews. Also stay on good terms with your boss so that they approve your points without too much of scrutiny in case your BSchool allows approvals only from your managers. 

Addition 3: Use that Coursera/ udemy your company provides you before you join MBA to complete some courses in domains you like. They will add good keywords to your CV. 
 


Addition 4: Making your CV is the toughest task you'll experience. You'll have to keep it within one page, limit a point to one line, add action verbs, keywords numbers and impact all in one line. Also you'll need to make CVs for different domains (marketing, finance, general, prodman, etc). So go to your college armed with a detailed Master CV. And show your CV points to many seniors, super seniors and make them absolutely sharp and crisp. 

Addition 5: Use gestures as much as possible. Get your friends some homemade food, write your closest friend a note on how much they mean to you, or order some waffles for your roommate, take an ill friend to the hospital. On the last day of my summer internship, I bought 15-20 dairy milks worth 10 rupees and gave it to my managers, the HRs who handled us interns, my HRBP and other members of the team as a thank you. All of them got so so happy, I can't tell you. It felt like they were kids in a birthday party who got a large chocolate and a set of stationery as a return gift. Such gestures go a very long way and people WILL remember you very fondly for it, for all their lives and help you whenever needed for sure. 

P.S: **I'll soon do another ""2 cents"" post for all CAT and OMET aspirants here related to exam and gdpi prep. I actually wrote this ""2 cents"" for the ones who've or will convert a BSchool and join this year, but I'm amazed at how such kind of a post also ended up giving some motivation to those who are yet to give CAT and OMETs.**

Also, thank you for showing so much love to the post. I hope this inspires you all to work hard and get into the best BSchools :) ❤️💞

Hi, I am Harry Venice, an Attachment, Trauma, and Jungian Therapist who is also certified to score the Adult Attachment Interview for Reflective Function.

If you want to join my free newsletter for exclusive articles and podcast updates, go to: [www.harryvenice.com/](https://www.harryvenice.com/)

**Today I will cover how we can heal from Shame and Addiction by exploring Robert Bly’s poetry and his metaphor of the garden.**

Some key points covered: complexes (CW7), Marion Woodman (addiction to Perfection), and the Garden as a symbol or metaphor (also note that the Garden metaphor has a link to Collected Work 16 where Jung talks about the 'trellis' and the analytic process as a way of growth and rebuilding a new stronger foundation).

**Robery Bly** was a well known poet who was deeply versed in Jungian Psychology and wrote important books on the mother complex, male initiation, and the shadow. On a side note, his wife was a Jungian Analyst.

Bly uses the metaphor of needing to tend to our ‘garden’ when it comes to healing and inner work. This metaphor focuses on flowers and weeds. When we have shame, we tend to not only remove weeds from our garden but also destroy our flowers. This desire to ‘split off’, expunge, break away from our existing ‘self’ and want something new, something else. To start over fresh. Ashamed of what we are or what we were or what we did. This is the ‘shame’ that Robert Bly was getting at in his book ‘Iron John’.

I have done this many times in my life. Started over. Destroyed the garden. The flowers and the weeds.

In more technical and clinical terms, I think this is steeped in conditional attachment provided by parents and also complex trauma. In more human terms, in the world of metaphor, psychoanalysis, poetry, soul: it is shame and addiction to perfection.

That is why Robert Bly refers to Marion Woodman, Jungian Analyst, and her book ‘Addiction to Perfection’ when he discusses his metaphor of the garden and the shame that men and women hold deep in their hearts. Below is the relevant quote from Iron John:

>“Addiction to perfection, as Marion Woodman reminds us, amounts to having no garden. The anxiety to be perfect withers the vegetation. Shame keeps us from cultivating the garden. **Men and women deeply caught in shame will, when they tend their garden, pull out both weeds and flowers because so many of their own feelings seem defective and soiled.”**

**How garden work begins**

It may begin unexpectedly. For example, the loss of a job or an illness may slow us down. Or we may consciously choose to slow down. For me, the loss of a job after working my tail off and being bullied forced me into what Jungians would call ‘the mid life passage’ but what most would call a ‘mid life crisis’. I had to tend to a garden which has been neglected for decades. I had to find the garden which was hard enough. Then I realised the garden was neglected and needed new soil, before we could cultivate the flowers.

A more recent example of being forced into the garden were injuries I suffered from playing too much tennis. When I was a child, I played tennis with friends from the ages of 9 to 13 at a local clay court owned by a small church. However, when I went to a private school for high school my parents did not allow me to play tennis. It was never an option. I was ‘forced’ to play cricket because my parents thought it was ‘prestigous’ and as immigrants, they wanted to feel important and like the Australians. But they put their insecurities onto their children, and being one of their children, I played this sport I didn’t like. Of course, after years of deep inner work, I realised that my love for ‘tennis’ had fallen into the unconscious, and it re-emerged randomly at the age of 39. As the Jungian Analyst Robert Johnson says, this was an “unlived life”. It became an emotional and obsessive experience. I was compelled: I had to play this game I loved, this game that was denied to me, I needed to live ‘this unlived life’.

I hired a coach, I played by myself, I played with others, and I even won a local tournament and the prize money of €20. Unfortunately, with all the injuries I incurred, just one physio appointment was €90. However, the key is that although I lived the ‘unlived life’ of the teenager who wanted to play tennis, I also did it in the same way that my teenager self would: with unconscious shame and desires for perfection. This is what led to the overuse injuries that forced me away from the tennis court and back into my garden. You see I literally could not play tennis anymore. So much like an illness or getting fired… I was forced to slow down and see how far I had gone off track.

I note that Carl Jung said there is a benefit to going deep into a complex (e.g. an obsession, an addiction, bad relationship, etc). He said that the deeper one gets into a complex the more they get over it (e.g. see Collected Work 7). When you take the wrong path hard enough, it can help you learn from it more, and also engage it more. You learn more about yourself. And sometimes you have to go to the extremes just to see how much in denial or traumatized you are.

**What tending to our garden looks like**

If we use my tennis experience, tending to the garden may mean not playing tennis for two or three months. Letting the injuries heal. Focusing on other things. And letting the body heal and returning to tennis, not to win games or have the ‘perfect’ technique on your shots, but just accepting the misses and the losses. Playing just a couple times per week and having balance in life to tend not only to the garden but also responsibilities, priorities, relationships, work, finances, etc. Balance. Not dissociation or avoidance of soul, feelings, life.

When you get fired on the other hand, it can really blow your identity and self esteem apart. It can trigger the conditional attachment we were raised with. The hurt. The trauma. IN these circumstances, tending to the garden can simply mean taking time away. Processing the grief, the loss, the shame, and how you sold yourself short just for a pay cheque, a work place, a title, an external validation. How you let that manager disrespect you, or let that thing they did ‘slide’, when in fact it was a deep violation and a public humiliation. You need compassion. Not to rush yourself to the next job and not to shame yourself if you don’t succeed at new job applications.

For busy parents, mothers and fathers, it may mean making some time for yourself. Getting up early in the morning (even at 5 am) and doing NOTHING. Not going to the gym. Not doing extra work. Just simply being. Make that cup of coffee and read the book you never read. Go for a slow walk. Do some yoga. Watch that show you never watched. This is not about the kids, your husband or wife, or anyone else. This is time just for you. DO the thing you don’t normally do. In this modern world, that simply may mean: to do no thing. NOTHING.

I was thinking of a weekly 2 hour meet up to teach each other Italian/French and piano. I'm a complete beginner.

I will be back in Paris full time by the beginning of July and I'd love to give it a go!

**Today I will cover how we can heal from Shame and Addiction by exploring Robert Bly’s poetry and his metaphor of the garden.**

Some key points covered: complexes (CW7), Marion Woodman (addiction to Perfection), and the Garden as a symbol or metaphor (also note that the Garden metaphor has a link to Collected Work 16 where Jung talks about the 'trellis' and the analytic process as a way of growth and rebuilding a new stronger foundation).

**Robery Bly** was a well known poet who was deeply versed in Jungian Psychology and wrote important books on the mother complex, male initiation, and the shadow. On a side note, his wife was a Jungian Analyst.

Bly uses the metaphor of needing to tend to our ‘garden’ when it comes to healing and inner work. This metaphor focuses on flowers and weeds. When we have shame, we tend to not only remove weeds from our garden but also destroy our flowers. This desire to ‘split off’, expunge, break away from our existing ‘self’ and want something new, something else. To start over fresh. Ashamed of what we are or what we were or what we did. This is the ‘shame’ that Robert Bly was getting at in his book ‘Iron John’.

I have done this many times in my life. Started over. Destroyed the garden. The flowers and the weeds.

In more technical and clinical terms, I think this is steeped in conditional attachment provided by parents and also complex trauma. In more human terms, in the world of metaphor, psychoanalysis, poetry, soul: it is shame and addiction to perfection.

Onother thing is, I have a problem with alcohol. I don't get drunk every day but sometimes I do and I use it as a coping strategy... I am too ashamed to admit it but I feel that it's not healthy.

I'm an upcoming ECE junior. I have a bunch of friends from my nationality, and I share an apartment with some. I am always with them, whether it is studying on campus, going out for coffee or anything really. This group includes people from every age and major, so I don't have anyone that is my year and major, I just have people from different majors and ages. Now, while this lifestyle is sufficient for most of the people in this group (they lived in big cities where they always had a community and never sought outside friends, while I lived in a small town with no form of community so I always had American friends) I really miss having friend that have similar interests and majors as me. I tried to join orgs like IEEE and SWE, and honestly IEEE was not open to new people, they had already formed friend groups and it is genuinely impossible to join them. SWE was just a bunch of girls playing nice and talking to you in events and completely disregarding your existence anywhere else. I tried talking to people in my classes, especially the girls and everyone is so cold and no one is interested in talking to me for more than like 3 minutes and I don't even know what I'm doing wrong they are just always cold from the start and then dismiss me immediately. I made some friends freshman year, but barely a couple lasted into my second year. So, going into semester 4, I stopped approaching people and trying to do anything with anyone, and just kept it with my friends I have within my community.

I have also gone to MSA events and the Nueces Mosque, and felt completely disregarded there as well, I think people are very closed off and only interact with their own ethnicities (Arabs with Arabs and Desis with Desis) I am neither Arab nor Desi, I don't know their languages or cultures, I don't wear the hijab or dress as modestly as most of the girls there (like I wear t-shirts nothing scandalous but still), and people don't really approach me or when they do, they greet me in Arabic or use Arabic words within the conversation (and I'm not talking about mA, iA, habibti) and then I feel so lost. I never get called for outings or anything, people only say hi to me when they see me around, but I can never form a close enough bond to the point where I see them often. 

I also realized that a lot of people  know each other from high school or other instances from the past, but I didn't know a single soul when coming to UT, and I am genuinely so tired of seeking friendships, I don't know what to do and I am so tired. Like I don't even have people I can discuss my classes with half of the time, and I need at least some study buddies or I might not make it anymore.

I knew that plastic retainer trays increased the risk of cavities, so I asked how I could be more proactive in my oral health. I already brush regularly (100% nights, 90% mornings) with a highly recommended electric toothbrush, I floss everyday, and I use fluoride mouthwash most nights. What else could I do?

Short of cutting back on my coffee habit, my dentist recommended that every night, after I finish my routine but before I put in my trays, that I blot the top my molars with my toothpaste and put my trays right on top. I have never had a dentist recommended that.

I already know that using toothpaste to clean your trays can discolor them and even erode the material. But what about actually trapping the toothpaste against my teeth for 5-8 hours every night? I also heard that it’s better to not rinse after brushing your teeth because it washes all the fluoride out before it can do its job.

So is this a legitimate practice? Will leaving toothpaste on my teeth, under my trays actually increase my oral health, or did my dentist make a reckless choice by advising this?

Lost on what to do with Izuku their only enemy left, All For One surprisingly responds to Izuku's suggestion of talking it out with: Fuck it, we ball.

Thus leading to a brighter future where Izuku rehabilitated the LOV and numerous other villains, fixed society's flaws that (in some ways) created such broken people, fell in love, married, and had kids with Melissa, Mei, Toga, Todoroki's mom, Ippan Josei, and Lady Nagant.

He also got to be a very proud Not-dad to Eri watching her graduate UA with honors alongside his wives and infant kids as she plans to follow in his footsteps bettering the word with mind and heart rather than with a Quirk and her fist.

8 years since the day Izuku became the World's Last Hero, he looks up proud with a cup of coffee in hand at the statue of himself and All For One shaking hands, an immortalization of when everything went right.

Cue his classmate, Nezu, and Aizawa showing up with all the other heroes that had been vaporized.

Nezu explaining cheerfully the device had transported them all to an alternate past where All For One was killed as a baby and the world was worser off with those possessing meta abilities being hunted and killed by the world's governments. Said bad alternate timeline they all made better (don't ask what they did. We're all better knowing. It ain't pretty man.) before returning to their proper time.

Which is when they all see the statue of Izuku and All For One shaking hands and come to the wrong conclusion.

Thankfully (or not if you ask Izuku in a few seconds) Iida through a shitload of Trigger and Quirk Evolutions he got in the bad timeline can now run fast enough to turn back time for everyone.

Which undoes all of the good Izuku did for the world along with his marriages and kids.

Then Nezu has everyone go play golf whilst Izuku despair over what he's lost.

(Someone didn't beat me to this skit, did they? Should I have just had Izuku get together with Toga or Lady Nagant? I thought it'd be funnier if Izuku became Todoroki's stepdad without Todoroki there to prefer it over who his actual dad is.)",15,1750054981.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,1,0.9,False

Also could use some much needed motivation to get up and get dressed!
