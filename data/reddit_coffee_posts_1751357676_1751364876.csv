Both of my parents have jobs so they were rarely home, only at dinners I had a rough childhood growing up but unlike me, my younger sister had a far better one, she was not told to stop celebrating her birthdays as it cost a lot or that she won't be getting any birthday gifts, dresses or anything. While I slept on the couch till my 12th standard coz there was not enough space in my house. 
She takes everything for granted and being the youngest in the family everyone coddles her and she always gets everything she wants . Whereas I have to buy myself everything I want. 
These days she's become very rude being a teenager she is. But now it's becoming too much.
Like a was making a coffee for myself one day and she went ""why aren't you making mine "" and I did not say anything and I made for her too and then she goes ""I never asked you to make mine"". 
And then we started arguing. I got so mad that I
Told her that I never wanted to be responsible for her she was never something I asked for and then she started crying saying that you shouldn't be saying stuff like that, and I was like yeah maybe stop being rude to others and stop acting like a brat and then maybe I won't say stuff like that.
So what should I do? I mean I have my life as well, I have looked after her a lot but I have to do my stuff too, I explained her all of this but she goes ""well nobody asked you to do so"" and when I'd say things like these she acts like I am the one at fault.

# Rare earths deal with China raises alarm over U.S. supply chain independence.

***As America celebrates its independence this July 4, the*** [***rare earths trade deal with China***](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/07/01/tech-metals/china-to-resume-rare-earth-exports-to-us/2348.html) ***raises uncomfortable questions about how truly self-reliant the nation remains in the technologies that underpin its economic and military strength.***

***This includes concerns raised by critical mineral experts, who caution that China's commitment to resume rare earth shipments is a double-edged sword that puts American supply chain independence at risk.***

***While these shipments will deliver short-term relief to American manufacturers starving for these tech metals, the lifting of a supply chain emergency that threatened to bring automotive and high-tech manufacturing to a halt lowers the urgency to build domestic supply chains that free America's economy from dependence on China.***

https://preview.redd.it/1qfnk7wtk8af1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=af510113f4488eb3f485dd402cde78fa3118f0b2

As a result of exporting the U.S. mining industry overseas under the guise of globalization, American manufacturers now must rely on foreign nations, primarily China, for more than half their supply of 40 minerals deemed critical to the U.S., including 100% import-reliant for 12 of them, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

While this dependence has been an issue that has been building for decades, the growing need for previously obscure metals like antimony, gallium, and rare earths for high-tech, clean energy, and military applications has elevated critical minerals to a top economic and national security priority for the U.S.

The urgent need to build out a domestic critical minerals supply chain is reflected in the ""Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production"" executive order signed by President Trump in March.

""Our national and economic security are now acutely threatened by our reliance upon hostile foreign powers' mineral production,"" the order states.

These threats became apparent following restrictions on the exports of seven rare earths highly critical to aerospace, automotive, energy, defense, and high-tech manufacturing put in place by Beijing in April.

By May, Ford Motor Company was forced to temporarily halt production of the Ford Explorer at its Chicago plant due to a shortage of rare earth magnets needed for alternators, sensors, power windows and seats, infotainment center speakers, airbags, fuel pumps, and a long list of other essential components.

This was quickly followed by a warning from the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) that China's rare earth export restrictions would cause disruptions in auto parts manufacturing that would reverberate across the U.S. automotive sector.

***""Immediate and decisive action is needed to prevent widespread disruption and economic fallout across the vehicle supplier sector,"" MEMA penned in a statement to Reuters.***

# One can dream, right?

Last week, Beijing announced that it will resume shipment of rare earths to the U.S. following a trade deal signed by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

While these shipments will bring some short-term relief to American automotive and electronics manufacturers facing critical mineral shortages, Zumwalt-Forbes is concerned it will undermine efforts to build a domestic supply chain that can shield the U.S. from China wielding its critical minerals dominance as a trade war weapon.

***""This doesn't build new capacity. It delays it. It doesn't reduce dependence. It deepens it,"" she penned in a LinkedIn post. ""If we're serious about industrial competitiveness and national security, we need to stop treating access to Chinese supply as a win. It's a warning.""***

 **Points**

* ***China has shown its readiness and ability to weaponize American and global dependence on rare earth metals.***
* ***A new trade framework announced under which China will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six months does not change the fact that critical mineral supply chains are too concentrated, too fragile, and too exposed to Beijing’s leverage and control.***
* ***It is time for the United States to treat critical minerals not as commodities, but as instruments of geopolitical power, writes international policy and trade analyst Dewardric McNeal.***

[It's time for U.S. to treat rare earths as power. China already does](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/29/us-china-rare-earth-minerals-metals-geopolitics-power.html)

[A mining machine is seen at the Bayan Obo mine containing rare earth minerals, in Inner Mongolia, China.China Stringer Network | Reuters](https://preview.redd.it/dfungqigj8af1.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b4020de66c9c3771b10622bee10515a361ff8ca)

In April 2025, China imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements and the permanent magnets derived from them — materials that form the foundation of modern life and modern warfare. [Fighter jets, missiles](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/chinas-rare-earth-squeeze-puts-defense-giants-in-the-crosshairs.html), electric vehicles, drones, wind turbines, and even data centers rely on high-performance magnets made from these critical minerals. By restricting their flow, Beijing did not just flex its industrial muscle, it revealed America’s and the rest of the world’s dangerous vulnerability. [China’s latest actions](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/13/chinas-tight-grip-on-rare-earths-shows-little-sign-of-weakening.html) show their readiness and ability to weaponize American and global dependence.

This is not a new challenge. The United States has known for over 15 years that its critical mineral supply chains were too concentrated, too fragile, and too exposed to Chinese leverage and control. And yet, across Democratic and Republican administrations, we have failed to respond with urgency or coherence. Now, the consequences of those failures have grabbed us by the neck and are cascading across our commercial and defense sectors.

Following the London talks, Washington and Beijing announced on Friday [a new trade framework](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/27/china-us-agree-details-of-london-trade-framework-trade-agreement-beijing.html) under which China will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six months. U.S. officials have publicly extolled the breakthrough — but have offered few details about what was given in return. That leaves major questions unanswered: What were the U.S. trade-offs? How will the deal be enforced? And what happens when the six months are up?

Skepticism is high. Ford recently halted production at its Chicago plant due to a magnet shortage — underscoring that even short-term supply interruptions have real consequences. Paper agreements are not supply chain solutions. Without transparency, timely approvals, and long-term planning, this could easily become another diplomatic cycle of one step forward, two steps back.

Even this limited reprieve carries risks. Dozens of companies in Europe and North America have described [China’s export license process as highly invasive](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-rare-earths-exports-2fd0dab4?st=nRDz5Z) — requiring firms to submit detailed production data, end-use applications, facility images, customer names, and transaction histories. Some applicants have been denied for not providing photographs or documentation of their end users.

Executives say the process amounts to “official information extraction.”

While firms are advised not to share sensitive IP, omitting key details can mean indefinite delays. For companies in defense supply chains, the implications are alarming: valuable commercial intelligence could be used to map competitors, disrupt pricing, or advance Chinese substitutes.

This isn’t just licensing — it’s competitive surveillance. And until the U.S. builds secure, independent capacity across the critical minerals supply chain, it remains exposed to both disruption and data risk.

This vulnerability did not happen overnight. Many have been watching this slow-motion train wreck for years. In 2010, China cut off rare earth exports to Japan during a maritime dispute, a clear warning shot the U.S. observed but brushed off. In 2014, the Obama administration won a WTO case against China’s export restrictions but wrongly assumed that legal success would deter further manipulation.

# What Trump, Biden have done

The first Trump administration identified rare earths as critical but notably exempted them from 2018 China tariffs, perhaps an unspoken acknowledgment of U.S. dependence. Biden took the most structured approach to date: Executive Order 14017, the Critical Minerals Working Group, and funding from the IIJA and IRA. Strategic partnerships like the Minerals Security Partnership emerged. But progress was slow, hampered by permitting delays and uneven ally commitments.

The second Trump administration has returned with more aggressive measures, invoking Section 232, activating the Defense Production Act, and proposing major funding boosts in FY2026. A National Energy Dominance Council now coordinates efforts. Yet these measures, like China’s six-month reprieve, still fall short of dislodging Beijing’s grip. And crucially, the defense sector remains cut off, with no such licensing window available.

The recent G7 summit in Canada underscored the global stakes. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen [directly accused China of “weaponizing” its control](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3314770/new-china-shock-von-der-leyen-revives-hard-line-beijing-g7-summit) over key materials like rare earths, calling for a united G7 response. The result: a [G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/rwkj3dls/minerals-en.pdf). Though China was not mentioned by name, the subtext was unmistakable. The plan commits G7 members to raise ESG and traceability standards for key resources; mobilize capital for new projects in critical mineral mining and processing; and cooperate on innovation in recycling, substitution, and refining technologies.

Predictably, Beijing reacted with fury. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the plan as “a pretext” for protectionism, claiming the G7 was instigating confrontation out of fear of losing market share.

Brussels is now signaling that trade negotiations with Beijing are effectively stalled, so the odds of Chinese retaliation — particularly against the EU — are rising. If China doubles down, it risks pushing the EU, Japan, South Korea, and India more tightly into Washington’s orbit — precisely what Beijing hopes to avoid.

# China’s dominant position in rare earth mining

The raw numbers are staggering. China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare earth mining but over 90% of refining capacity. It produces 92% of the world’s neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets — used in everything from submarines to Teslas. This dominance is no accident. China subsidized processing, focused on global acquisitions across the supply chain, and scales up production much faster than the West can approve and issue permits for a single mine.

U.S. sites like [MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/)’ Mountain Pass and Round Top remain incomplete without downstream processing. The DoD and DOE have offered grants, and the FY2026 Trump budget looks to expand U.S. mining capacity and secure access to critical minerals. But all this remains dwarfed by China’s head start and longtime industrial command-and-control of the sector.

[The Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine & Processing Facility, owned by MP Materials, in Mountain Pass, California.George Rose | Getty Images News | Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/83w7hyjlj8af1.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=0db15316883a525502b39d454a479d09b0b3e2f6)

China moved early and decisively into Africa and Latin America, partnering with governments in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bolivia, and Chile; investing in ports, rails, and refining infrastructure. In contrast, U.S. efforts and engagement on these sets of issues has been piecemeal and values-forward, prioritizing transparency and governance, important issues indeed, but delivering limited momentum of the critical mineral issues. Even recent MOUs with Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo remain, for now, symbolic, hindered by conflict and instability in those countries.

The London talks and recent trade deal progress bought time. But time without a strategy is not fruitful. China’s licensing regime remains intact, its data demands unabated. The defense sector remains shut out. Meanwhile, congressional threats to rescind clean energy and industrial policy funding could stall rare-earth projects just as they gain traction.

This is a decisive moment. China is betting that America’s internal divisions — between labor, industry, environmentalists, tribal nations, and political factions — will prevent the kind of unified, sustained effort needed to compete. They may be right. The U.S. needs to proves them wrong.

# Critical minerals are geopolitical power

The United States must now treat critical minerals not as commodities, but as instruments of geopolitical power. China already does. Escaping its grip will require more than mine permits and short-term funding. It demands a coherent, long-term strategy to build a complete supply chain that includes not only domestic capabilities but also reliable allies and partners. From mining and refining to magnet production and recycling, every link must be strengthened through targeted investment, permitting reform, and strategic coordination.

A successful and sustainable policy requires commitment from one presidency to the next. Nor can the U.S. afford to engage allies and partners only rhetorically. Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chile, and Indonesia (among others) need sustained partnerships backed by financing, technology transfer, and critical infrastructure investments, not just our lectures on governance.

The six-month export reprieve from China is not a solution — it is a stress test. It reveals whether the U.S. can finally focus and act, or whether it will retreat again into complacency. Beijing is betting it will be the latter. Washington must respond with urgency, unity, and a strategy equal to the scale of the challenge. There is still time, but not much.

# Partner been meeting men for sex 

69 replies

Mag100 · Today 09:03

recently found out that husband had been meeting men from dating apps for sex(complete strangers).  
when I first found out his answer was he tried it once giving anal but didn’t work, but later after Ive kept asking for details this then evolved to him receiving, he then said he’s met up half dozen times doing receiving anal oral/mastubating with these men but stopped after few months and deleted the apps.  
I can’t even describe how I feel it feels like grief and I’m struggling with day to day and have anxiety and depression I think.  
he says he doesn’t know why he did it and regrets it and doesn’t want to loose me as he loves me etc etc, we have been married along time and I do love him and can’t imagine being alone so agreed to try to work it out.  
We have had long conversations about it and I’ve asked a lot of questions which he answers, I think the issue for me is why did we get to this when we were happy as far as I could tell before I found out, he said it stopped long before I found out about it, and I know we weren’t sleeping together during this time as there was a period before this that he made it clear he didn’t want sex with me anymore as was struggling, but turns out it’s because he was meeting these men.  
Ive asked directly if he’s bi/gay but he denies this said it was something he wanted to try to see if he liked it but he’s not gay never was and he’s never done anything like that in past. How can I know this is true can men do this but not be gay? He says he’s got no interest in it now that feeling has gone and he’s ashamed of himself for doing it.  
I also found flirty messages between him and a coworker (male) during this time, when I think about it I can see he was always talking about this guy as he had come out as gay and says it triggered him to explore his own sexuality. He says he can’t explain why it happened but he did say he wasn’t unfaithful with this coworker although he admitted he would have if the guy showed interest, I was upset by this the guy has since let the place husband works at but they were still meeting up for coffee lunch upto the point I found out, husbands adamant that there was never anything like that it was just flirting and coworker was never interested as he’s got a partner, when I asked why he continued to meet up if he had feelings he says that had passed and it was just friendship.  
I’m not entirely convinced on this but said this contract had to stop which he agreed to straight away.  
Hes done things to try and build trust as he puts it, like deleting this guy from phone, giving passcode to phone so I can check if I want, tracking on phone for him, I can see he’s trying to do the right thing but I’m just bewildered by it all.  
I don’t have anyone to talk to about it which is why I’m here I suppose just wanted to say it out loud so I’m not feeling like I’m going mad, some days I’m so sad I can’t even leave the house I just need to get myself out of this dark hole I’m in just don’t know what the way forward is",1,1751364529.0,MNTrolls,0,1.0,False

Everyone knew Kingston was on its last leg too, and at the time, I had people tell me I was nuts for going to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s corporate office to work in federal communications.

But now, here we are, blogging on the back side of what any sane person would consider a happy outcome that in fact, materialized from a really, really, really…shitty situation.

And that’s the takeaway I hope everyone here has when it comes to their current investing journey. Learn and try something new, or be content with the old and accept the outcome of mediocrity everyone knows is already baked in the cake.

Hopefully, you’ll continue to invest in yourself and who knows? Maybe seven or eight years from now, you might wake up, drink your coffee, then see something on Facebook that makes you stop and think, “Geez, am I glad I didn’t stay in that lane?!”

Works in life the same way as it does with investments. Keep moving and learning, and as you do, I imagine there’s a high likelihood that the brokerage account will continue to grow too.

I was disguised as a common man, since revealing my identity would cause commotion. Ee fans, yk.

It felt good to see people vibing

I ran to my secret office in the mall, and asked my PA to summon him. I waited. 2 mins, 5mins, 10 mins. At last he came. After 20 frickin minutes. He was LATE again. I fired him on spot. What else was I supposed to do?

1loxnk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1loxnk5/i_ended_my_relationship_and_went_no_contact_with/,"I ended my relationship and went no contact with my ex when I caught him lying, AIO by going full no contact?","TLDR; I got into a serious relationship with a guy right after an unhealthy relationship with a lot of lying, manipulation and some SA who was a friend during that time. After we started dating I found out he lied to me, a lot, so I ended things, ended up talking to the two women he lied to me about and went no contact. He’s been trying to reach out and I didn’t respond and I’m curious if I’m being too harsh or over reacting. 

So I (31 F) was in a relationship last year that started in July with a guy we’ll call Brad (38 M) which ended in January. Brad and I were long distance and it was an unhealthy relationship from the start (he SA’d me the first time we slept next to eachother) and in November I found out during our talking stage he lied and told me he was single while he was seriously pursuing another woman. The woman ended things with him one week before he flew me out to see him and make our relationship official. He also always used to tell me he only cheated once but was very against cheating, and I found out he cheated in almost all his relationships. Now in retrospect I can see how much he would manipulate me. 

In december, our relationship was ending but we were waiting to see eachother after Christmas to finalize the decision. During November and December after I found out about the lying my friend, let’s call him Isaac (33 M) started getting a lot closer to me and supporting me through the breakup. We were talking all the time, hours long phone calls every night etc and something started to build between us. 

I saw him on Christmas and we cuddled a bit and talked. He told me he loved me, had been completely single for 2 years because he was looking for a serious relationship, that he had one friends with benefits he’d see once a month but it was very platonic and he hadn’t seen her recently and that he wanted us to be together. I told him we couldn’t start anything until I’d made a final decision with my ex but that I was also interested and wanted us to go slowly. We agreed and I requested given the dishonesty in my last relationship that he be fully transparent, and that I would also, about any other relationships/exes in our lives and was very calm about it. 

Fast forward 5 months and he came to visit me in Europe where I was doing my masters. We were together the whole time but I was starting to notice some red flags. Inconsistency in his stories about past relationships and their current status, vagueness when I would ask about his exes who were still friends, he would tell me random stories about women (one ex who he said sent him an “exit survey” from a two year old breakup out of the blue, and a “friend” in a toxic relationship who would call him to complain), I noticed he wouldn’t keep his word about travel, agreed conversations etc. and I even caught him using chat gpt in an argument once. 

When he was visiting, he gave me his passcode and permission to use his phone if I needed. One night after an argument we had I went to read our insta chat on his phone (mine was deactivated and it’s where we talked in Nov-dec) because I couldn’t remember something we were arguing about. When I was there I saw a chat with a woman we’ll call Roxanne (27 F) and opened it. From that night for the next 10 days I gave him a million chances to tell me the truth, he lied non stop until eventually I asked his permission to see the chats (I only skimmed them the first night and only on insta because I felt uncomfortable invading his privacy). He let me and I spent the day reading - here’s everything I found out. 

In April he travelled to America after being with me for 2 weeks and meeting my family and spent a week with his ex (exit survey girl) let’s call her Nina and had been leading her on for 2 years since their breakup. She would ask him if there was hope for them and he would just tell her how much he cares about her and their relationship was basically still happening just without sex or a label until May when he finally told her he just wants to be friends but when she asked if he was seeing anyone he lied and said no. He lied to me about their whole relationship, has said it was only 4 months and they never did more then kiss but it was 1 year and they did everything but intercourse, told me he ended it but she did, and much much more. Her and I spoke and she told me everything and it was dizzying how he and I were talking all day everyday and he was also talking to her all day everyday. 

Roxanne, was his affair partner in that relationship and he cheated on Nina for 6 months with her. Roxanne was in a relationship too and he continues to cheat with her on her boyfriend for two years. They had an explicit agreement to lie to each others current and future partners for eachother. They would tell eachother they loved eachother, he’d buy her expensive clothes/jewellery/perfume, he even met her boyfriend and got him a job while he was sleeping with her. They slept together in December right before our conversation, and spent nights on the phone with him watching her sleep and then calling her right when he woke up. Definitely not platonic friends with benefits that would talk once a month.. in January he sat her down and according to him says things stopped between them. 

I found out he had a folder on her phone of photos of her, and photos he would screenshot of 6-7 women he met travelling and would chase after on Instagram he would use to jerk off too, that he continued to do while we were in a relationship. He even had photos saved that were of female friends of his I met that he would secretly jerk off too. None of the women except Roxanne knew he was saving their photos or consented. We were supposed to travel together after my masters and he reached out to some of these girls and asked to see them - without mentioning me to them or them to me so he would have left to see them alone.. 

There was one woman, let’s call Malika - who these women he invited introduced him too in early November as a possible wife. He had photos saved of her in November and I remember seeing their chat, I didn’t read it but they were in regular contact until February/march. When he realized I went on his phone he deleted all his chats with her before I could read them. 

Anyway, it was a terrible experience with him gaslighting me to high heaven until I read everything myself. When I did I asked him to leave and we had a coffee before we both went in different directions. Before the coffee, his ex Nina contacted me and we talked. I ended up telling her about Roxanne because he gaslit her about it for years and she thought she was crazy. Roxanne called him while we had coffee, I asked if I could answer and he said yes so I very calmly and respectfully introduced myself and told her I just wanted her to know the person he was with when they were cheating together. She freaked the fuck out - yelling, cussing me out, questioning his manhood. He didn’t put her in her place and offered to talk to her in person when he got back, in-front of me. 

We went our own ways, he asked if he could contact me in the future I said he could send an email but I was unsure if I’d answer. He did within 24 hours it was vague, non descriptive and he attached a “development plan” which was so obviously copy pasted from chat gpt. Honestly it felt insulting that he would send me a 80% chat gpt generated attempt to win me back after everything. I didn’t answer. He reached out to me today - a flight we booked emailed him I didn’t show up. I know already he asked my best friend if I was fine and she said yes, but he messaged me asking if I was ok and I said I’m fine. It was a weird exchange and when he called me friend he called me “that girl”.

## Key Features Analysis

The 16 oz cup market offers a wide variety‍ of‍ options,⁣ each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Understanding the key features of different cups is crucial for making an informed purchasing decision.

**Material Construction:** The material used ​in⁣ a 16 oz ‍cup greatly impacts its durability, insulation⁣ properties,​ and overall aesthetic.Common materials include stainless steel, plastic‍ (BPA-free), glass, and ceramic. Stainless steel offers excellent insulation and durability, while plastic is lightweight and frequently enough more affordable. Glass provides a clean taste and is aesthetically pleasing, but ‌can be​ fragile. Ceramic cups are ⁢a classic choice, offering ⁤good heat ​retention, but are ⁤also prone to breakage.

**Insulation​ Technology:**⁣ For those who enjoy hot or cold beverages, insulation is a critical feature. Double-walled vacuum insulation is the most effective,​ keeping drinks hot for hours or cold for even longer. Some cups utilize‌ foam insulation,which is less effective but offers ⁣a lower ‍price‍ point. The type of insulation​ will directly impact how well the cup ‍maintains the ‌temperature ⁣of your drink.

**Lid Design and Seal:** The lid of a‍ 16 oz cup is essential for preventing spills and maintaining temperature. Look for lids with a secure seal⁤ to minimize leaks,especially if ​you⁢ plan‍ on using the cup for‍ commuting or ‍travel.Some​ lids feature sliding closures, while others have straw holes​ or flip-top designs.⁣ The best lid design depends⁤ on your personal preference and ⁢intended use.**Durability and Longevity:** A good 16 oz cup should be able to withstand daily use​ and resist damage from drops or impacts. Stainless steel cups are generally the most durable, while plastic cups​ can crack or break ⁣more easily. Glass and ceramic cups require⁣ careful‌ handling to avoid chipping or shattering. Consider ⁣the‌ overall construction and material quality when assessing the‍ durability of a cup.

**Handle Design and Ergonomics:** If you prefer a cup⁣ with a handle,⁢ pay attention to its design and ergonomics. A pleasant handle should fit‌ well in ‍your hand and provide ⁢a secure grip. Some handles are contoured for added ⁣comfort, while others are straight and minimalist. The handle material also matters; silicone or ‌rubber-coated handles can provide better grip than bare metal or plastic.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Maintaining a clean cup is essential for hygiene⁣ and preventing odors. Look for cups with wide openings ‌that are easy to ‌clean with a sponge or brush. Dishwasher-safe cups are especially convenient.⁤ Avoid cups with intricate designs or hard-to-reach crevices that can trap food particles‌ or bacteria.

Key ‍features of a quality 16 oz cup include:

*   Durable material construction.
*   Effective insulation technology.
*  ⁤ Leak-proof lid design.
*   Ergonomic handle (if applicable).
* ‍  Easy to clean.

For insulated cups,⁣ be sure to clean the inside ⁣of the lid⁣ thoroughly. Many cups are dishwasher-safe,but ⁤its always best to check the manufacturer's ⁢instructions.

**What is the ideal size for a reusable coffee cup, and why​ is 16 oz recommended frequently?**

**Are there specific features‌ to look for in a 16 ⁢oz cup for hot ‍beverages versus cold beverages?**
For hot beverages, look for⁣ a ‌16 oz cup with excellent insulation to keep your drinks hot for extended periods.

For cold beverages, insulation is also⁣ beneficial to keep your drinks cold ‌and prevent condensation from forming on the outside of ⁤the cup. A cup with a straw or a straw hole ⁤in the⁤ lid ⁢can be convenient for sipping cold drinks.

Started simple with lights and a thermostat, now I've got cameras, door locks, motion sensors, the whole thing.

But lately it feels like my house is watching me a little too closely.

Yesterday I walked into the kitchen at 2am for water and the lights came on at exactly 15% brightness. I never programmed that. Apparently it ""learned"" that's what I prefer for late night kitchen trips.

This morning my coffee maker started brewing before my alarm went off. The system somehow figured out I always get up 10 minutes early on Tuesdays.

The creepiest part? My smart doorbell now recognizes delivery drivers by their walking patterns. Not their faces, their walking patterns. It announced ""Amazon delivery approaching"" while the guy was still halfway down the street.

I'm torn because this stuff is actually super convenient. But also my house knows my habits better than I do at this point. It's predicting what I want before I know I want it.

Am I being paranoid or is this how we end up with AI that knows too much about us? Like where's the line between ""helpful automation"" and ""my house is studying me""?

It’s a loyalty platform where shop owners can create digital reward schemes – e.g. “free milkshake on your 3rd visit” or “free coffee on your 6th.” Customers scan a QR code on each visit, we track it, and they get a reward code by SMS when they qualify. Shop owners verify codes through a dashboard.

It’s all set up, working, live – but I’m getting stuck at square one: no shops are signing up. I pitched it to one cafe and they said they’re more interested in new customers, not rewarding existing ones. Fair point, but still a bit discouraging.

Has anyone here launched something similar or dealt with this kind of cold start? I’m not sure if I’m pitching it wrong, targeting the wrong type of business, or just need to get scrappier on outreach.

Would really appreciate any feedback, advice, or even brutal honesty. Thanks 🙏

I've been allergy tested, however I don't fully trust allergy tests as my symptomatic reactions rarely have a pattern.

I'm aware of a handful of definitive trigger items, coffee being one, but I kind of gave up caring almost. I eat whatever I think sounds good. Sometimes I get reactions, sometimes I don't.

I've been on so many medications and supplements for it and luckily, for the most part, by regimen now makes it bearable.

Erisa (As most people call her) is a 'normal' girl in Miyamasuzuka. People often see her as cheerful and goofy, often making jokes and a bit airhead sometimes. Her sense of money is seriously insane, like wdym she was willing to pay 50k yen for an ice cream?? Currently a first year in the Archery club, but most people could find her in malls and any fashion store/supplies. For someone who loves fashion she doesn't spend too much time dressing up but rather enjoys making outfits instead. Her signature? Adding a bunch of embroidery and often her initials. What most people didn't know was that she is a rich foreign heiress who moved from America a few years ago. Although she has many friends, somehow it never felt like she truly got close to anyone, hiding her real self in fear of 'that' happening again. Currently working with WxS as the main designer for both outfit and set designs, typically doing things in the background rather than being on stage. Her main story and issues will stem from her being unable to truly trust anyone (will continue to be an ongoing problem) and slowly letting go of her worries, letting more people into her life as time goes by and becomes less cautious.

So I’ve been going to this class to learn an instrument and I might be starting to like my instructor more than a friend.


To be honest we never had a student-teacher relationship. We always were friends and started the class off as friends. We send eachother memes and reels and it’s always been friendly banter between us. He is just an instructor, not the owner of the institution, so it’s easy for us to have an informal relationship. Anyways I’ve known him for almost three years now and we built great rapport right since the beginning which was like an instant connection.
One bright day I had a dream about how I went on a date with him and I woke up feeling a little ball of butterflies in my stomach for him. Almost a year and a half later here we are.
These are things which he has done which make me feel that there is something there:
	•	We had a thing where we were introducing ourselves and he had a little speech since he is one of the instructors. And during this entire speech he looked right into my eyes and looked away when I caught him looking at me. He also flirted with me when he was clearly tipsy.
	•	Same event a year later he did the same but only this time my friends noticed and ofc I did too but I didn’t look away, I looked at him fondly like a proud mama hen (lol) and he didn’t look away.
	•	At a show he also sort of made eye contact with me from stage (maybe I’m delusional maybe I’m not who knows).
	•	He offered me VIP tickets to this singer (v famous) since he knows the bassist.
	•	He offered me tix for the Backstreet Boys.
	•	He went to another country for a concert and brought back chocolates and gifts for me and told me he was looking for vinyls of my fav singer for me but couldn’t find them (he got chocolates for only his family, close friends and well, me).
	•	He got me this expensive-ish chocolate for my birthday (on the next day since I had class a day after) when he could have one forgotten and two gotten me a normal chocolate.
	•	We went to a big music festival where we went separately but were gonna meet inside. Unfortunately they had jammers inside so he couldn’t find me. Although he knew the stage I was gonna be at so he dragged his friends and came there and shouted out my name in front of 10,000 people idk why but hoping I’d find him. (That was so cute.)
	•	One time I couldn’t stop coughing so he offered to go get coffee for me.
	•	I was at his home studio where he made some coffee for me.
	•	We have gone to get coffee after class multiple times where he refuses to let me pay.
	•	My best friend passed away suddenly and he sort of knew her so the first class I went to he called me up beforehand and asked me if I wanted coffee and when I reached he was sitting in the dark and the lights were out and we ended up talking about everything and nothing for the next two hours amidst which we found out the lights were not gonna be on for another few hours but we still chose to stay and talk. During this he mentioned how he knew what bad happened but didn’t text me because he felt a text is going to do nothing except just remind me of it. And until that day I hadn’t even thought about this but that was exactly how I felt and I myself didn’t know about it but he did.
	•	He has ordered coffee for us multiple times and at this point he doesn’t even ask me since he knows my order.
	•	This one time at his house he was going to order coffee and insisted on paying and he threatened me saying ‘we’re literally ordering on my phone what makes you think you even have a chance to pay?’ He always acts so bewildered when I ask to pay like he gives me that ‘are you stupid?’ look.
	•	The next time he got me coffee I had decided to do something to make sure that it’s just me or that it isn’t in my head because this was making me lose my shit. Last week I asked him on text when he asked whether I wanted coffee that ‘how do you afford this’ and he didn’t reply to me right back on text but asked me what I meant by that once he came into the studio. I said ‘how do you afford getting coffee for all the students.’ Taking a deliberate pause I continued ‘or is it just me?’ I said smirking. To this day I can’t forget the look on his face. It was kind of a sheepish, coy smile/smirk which he was trying to hold back for sure. And then he says ‘actually….. it’s just you’ and I said ‘good. Keep it that way.’ Anyone would’ve known the way I said it was me flirting HARD.
	•	One time he called me to ask if I wanted ice cream and I said ‘aren’t you sick’ cause he was sick and he goes ‘yeah I am but this is for my family’ (parents and siblings) which made me spiral again. If it was for his family then why was he asking me?
	•	He also invited me to his band’s gig at a club which as far as I know he hasn’t invited anyone else to. He showed me the setlist and he’s playing one of my favourite songs. By a band he HATES. So I don’t know what to think.
	•	He also later invited me to pre-game booze with his band which just has me confused as fuck.
We’re both gonna drink and I don’t usually drink so let’s see what happens.

The only problem here is our ages. He’s 7/8 years older than me. But I have never clicked like this with anyone. And romantic or not I for sure know that I’m definitely not making this connection up. I’m just confused on whether I’m delusional that it’s leaning towards romantic because the connection? It’s there and it’s not ignorable. It’s electric.

My world revolved around Jax Harding, my older brother's captivating rockstar friend.

From sixteen, I adored him; at eighteen, I clung to his casual promise: ""When you're 22, maybe I'll settle down.""

That offhand comment became my life's beacon, guiding every choice, meticulously planning my twenty-second birthday as our destiny.

But on that pivotal day in a Lower East Side bar, clutching my gift, my dream exploded.

I overheard Jax's cold voice: ""Can't believe Savvy's showing up. She's still hung up on that st**id thing I said.""

Then the crushing plot: ""We're gonna tell Savvy I'm engaged to Chloe, maybe even hint she's pr**nant. That should scare her off.""

My gift, my future, slipped from my numb fingers.

I fled into the cold New York rain, devastated by betrayal.

Later, Jax introduced Chloe as his ""fiancée"" while his bandmates mocked my ""adorable crush""-he did nothing.

As an art installation fell, he saved Chloe, abandoning me to severe injury.

In the hospital, he came for ""damage control,"" then shockingly shoved me into a fountain, leaving me to bleed, calling me a ""jealous psycho.""

How could the man I loved, who once saved me, become this cruel and publicly humiliate me?

Why was my devotion seen as an annoyance to be brutally extinguished with lies and assault?

Was I just a problem, my loyalty met with hatred?

I would not be his victim.

Injured and betrayed, I made an unshakeable vow: I was done.

I blocked his number and everyone connected to him, severing ties.

This was not an escape; this was my rebirth.

Florence awaited, a new life on my terms, unburdened by broken promises.


Chapter 1
The air in Austin always felt thick with music, especially when The Night Howlers played.

I was sixteen, and Jax Harding was twenty-two.

He was my older brother Ben's best friend, the lead guitarist.

Charismatic, a little distant.

I had a massive crush on him.

It wasn't just a crush; it felt like my whole world tilted when he was near.

I baked cookies for their rehearsals, the ones with extra chocolate chips, just how Jax liked them.

I drew their early gig posters, my pencil strokes filled with a longing I didn't know how to name.

I knew every lyric to every song he'd ever written.

My eighteenth birthday.

I was a high school senior, my art school applications mailed, dreams of New York City buzzing in my head.

But that night, only Austin mattered, only The Continental Club where The Night Howlers were tearing up the stage.

Ben snuck me a sip of champagne backstage after their set.

It tasted like rebellion and courage.

Enough courage to find Jax, his dark hair damp with sweat, a half-smile playing on his lips as he talked to a roadie.

My heart hammered.

""Jax?""

He turned, that cool gaze landing on me.

""Hey, Savvy. Happy birthday, kid.""

The words tumbled out, a clumsy, heartfelt rush. ""I really like you, Jax. I have for years.""

Then, fueled by champagne and years of pent-up hope, I leaned in and k**sed him.

It was quick, probably awkward.

He didn't pull away, but he didn't k**s me back either.

When I drew back, cheeks burning, he was looking at me with an amused, slightly surprised expression.

He ruffled my hair, a gesture that felt both kind and dismissive.

""You're still a kid, Savvy.""

My heart sank.

""But hey,"" he continued, a lazy drawl in his voice, a little slurred from the beer he was nursing. ""When you graduate college and you're, like, twenty-two, if you still feel this way... maybe I'll finally be ready to settle down with a good girl. We'll see.""

He said it lightly, almost like a joke.

But I grabbed onto those words like a lifeline.

Twenty-two. It sounded like a promise.

Four years.

I got into Pratt, graphic design.

New York City swallowed me whole, a whirlwind of classes, projects, and a constant, dull ache for Austin, for Jax.

His ""promise"" became my secret timeline.

I followed The Night Howlers'modest success from afar, their songs a soundtrack to my late-night study sessions.

I meticulously planned for my twenty-second birthday.

It wasn't just a birthday; it was a deadline, a doorway.

I even designed a mock-up album cover, a visual representation of the future I imagined for us.

Silly, I knew, but it felt important. A gift for him.

Twenty-two.

The day finally arrived.

The Night Howlers were in New York for a small industry showcase, a chance to get signed.

My hands trembled as I clutched the ""album cover"" gift, wrapped carefully in plain brown paper.

They were having a pre-show meeting at a trendy bar on the Lower East Side.

I got there early, too eager, too nervous.

The bar was dimly lit, smelling of stale beer and new ambitions.

I spotted them in a semi-private booth near the back – Jax, Ben, the other bandmates.

And a woman I didn't recognize, sharp-looking, leaning close to Jax.

I hesitated, not wanting to interrupt.

Then I heard Jax's voice, low and complaining.

""Man, I can't believe Savvy's actually showing up. She's still hung up on that st**id thing I said years ago.""

My bl**d ran cold.

Another bandmate, their drummer, chimed in. ""Dude, you gotta shut that down. Chloe's gonna flip if she thinks you're leading on some college kid.""

Chloe. That must be the woman.

Jax sighed. ""I know, I know. That's the plan.""

His voice dropped a little, but I could still hear every venomous word.

""Chloe Davenport, she's our publicist, or trying to be. We're trying to impress her. She's helping me stage a whole thing. I told her I needed a 'crazy fan'intervention.""

A laugh, cold and cruel.

""We're gonna tell Savvy I'm engaged to Chloe, maybe even hint she's pr**nant. That should scare her off for good. Plus, Chloe thinks it'll make for a good 'settled rockstar'PR angle if we do get signed.""

Ben. My brother. He sounded uncomfortable, a mumbled protest.

""Jax, man, that's harsh.""

But he didn't push. Band peace, I guess. Or maybe he just didn't care enough.

The world tilted, not with a crush, but with nausea.

Devastation crashed over me, a physical blow.

The ""album cover,"" my carefully crafted dream, slipped from my numb fingers.

It hit the sticky floor with a soft thud.

I turned and fled, out of the bar, into the sudden, cold New York rain.

Each drop felt like a tiny shard of ice against my skin.

The rain plastered my hair to my face, blurring the city lights into meaningless streaks.

My mind reeled back, a st**id, painful reflex.

Years ago, a local music festival, a smaller version of SXSW. I was maybe fifteen, definitely too young to be backstage, but Ben had snuck me in.

The Night Howlers were just starting out, raw and hungry.

Chaos. Roadies yelling, equipment everywhere.

A heavy piece of stage lighting, precariously balanced, started to wobble.

I was right under it, mesmerized by Jax on stage during soundcheck.

Suddenly, strong hands grabbed my arm, yanking me back.

Jax.

He'd leaped off the low stage, his eyes wide with alarm.

The equipment crashed where I'd been standing a second before.

""You okay?"" he'd asked, his voice rough.

I could only nod, heart pounding.

He'd pressed something into my palm. His lucky guitar pick.

""Stay out of trouble, kid.""

That was it. The moment my silly crush solidified into something I thought was real, something worth waiting for.

That pick. I'd kept it in a little velvet box.

Now, the memory itself felt like a betrayal.

All those years.

The cookies, the posters, the late nights listening to their demos.

The way I'd structured my college life, my move to New York, all with that one distant, careless ""maybe"" from him as my North Star.

Every sacrifice, every choice, tinged with the hope of him.

His words echoed, ""Can't believe she's still hung up.""

A burden. That's what I was.

My love wasn't a gift; it was an annoyance, a problem to be managed with a cruel, staged lie.

A new path. I had to find one. Away from him, away from this.

The thought was a tiny, flickering candle in the storm of my pain.

I fumbled for my phone, my fingers stiff and cold.

I needed to talk to Ben, to scream, to understand.

But what was there to understand?

Ben had been there. He'd heard Jax's plan. His silence in that booth was a confirmation louder than any words.

He knew Jax was serious about Chloe. He knew Jax was going to break my heart, and he'd let it happen.

Maybe he even agreed with Jax. Maybe I was just the annoying little sister.

A text message pinged.

Unknown number, but my stomach lurched. I knew.

It was Jax.

""Heard you were at the bar. Sorry if you overheard stuff. Things with Chloe are serious. Best you move on.""

Not an apology. A dismissal.

My carefully constructed fantasy life shattered into a million pieces.

Move on.

Yes.

I scrolled through my contacts, found Jax's number, the one I knew by heart.

Blocked.

Then Ben's.

Blocked.

I stumbled into my tiny apartment, dripping water onto the worn wooden floor.

My eyes fell on the small velvet box on my dresser.

The lucky guitar pick.

I picked it up. It felt cold, alien in my hand.

A symbol of a lie.

With a sudden, sharp movement, I threw it into the tr**h can, burying it under discarded sketches and coffee grounds.

The first step.


Chapter 2
Jax figured Savvy's quiet disappearance from the bar was some kind of tactic.

He thought she was smart, playing hard to get after overhearing him.

He didn't get it, not really.

He couldn't imagine the depth of her hurt.

He was more annoyed that she'd almost ruined his pre-show buzz with Chloe.

""See? Total headcase,"" he muttered to his bandmates after she'd gone.

""Good thing Chloe's got that plan,"" their bassist, Mark, said, always eager to agree with Jax.

""Yeah, engagement, baby, the whole nine yards. That'll send her running for the hills,"" Jax said, trying to sound confident for Chloe's benefit, who was now looking at him with a raised eyebrow.

Chloe just smiled, a cool, calculating curve of her lips. ""It's good PR, darling. Rockstar finds true love. Settles down. The labels eat that up.""

Ben found me a few hours later, after their showcase.

I was huddled in my dorm room, tear-streaked and shivering, despite the heat blasting.

""Sav,"" he started, his voice hesitant. ""Jax told me you were at the bar.""

I didn't look at him.

""He's an a*s, Sav. What he said, what he's planning... it's messed up.""

""You didn't stop him,"" I whispered, my voice raw.

""I tried to talk to him before, when he first mentioned this 'scare Savvy off'idea with Chloe. But he wouldn't listen.""

He ran a hand through his already messy hair. ""He's completely snowed by Chloe. She wants into the industry, bad. And Jax... Jax thinks she's his ticket, and maybe something more.""

I remembered Jax in the booth, his eyes on Chloe, a look I'd never seen him give anyone.

A look I'd always dreamed he'd give me.

""He's really with her, isn't he?"" I asked, needing to hear it, to make it real.

Ben nodded slowly. ""Yeah, Sav. He is. For a while now, pretty serious.""

The words were like another punch to the gut.

He tried to say more, something about Jax being an i**ot, about how I deserved better.

But Chloe called Jax's phone then, her voice audible even from across the room where Ben had set it.

Jax, who had apparently come with Ben but lingered outside my door, picked up instantly.

""Hey, babe. Yeah, showcase went great... Yeah, I'm just checking on something... No, no, almost done.""

His voice, so different from the one he used with me, even when he was being kind.

He poked his head in. ""You good, Savvy?"" Not really looking at me, his attention already halfway back to Chloe.

I just stared at him.

""Right. Well. Ben, Chloe wants to go celebrate. You coming?""

He was gone before Ben could even answer.

Ben sighed. ""See? He's obsessed. I tried to tell him you weren't some psycho fan, that you genuinely cared. But his buddies, Mark and Lee, they just egg him on. 'She's just a kid, Jax. Chloe's a woman.'""

It was clear. I was an inconvenience. A loose end.

The next day, I walked to the international student office.

My hands were steady as I filled out the application for the Florence study abroad program.

The scholarship I'd been offered earlier in the year, the one I'd almost dismissed because it meant being even further from Jax.

Now, it felt like an escape hatch.

Florence. A new city, a new life.

As far away from Austin and Jax Harding as I could get.

A few days later was Ben's twenty-fifth birthday.

A party at some friend's upscale SoHo loft.

I didn't want to go. The thought of seeing Jax, of seeing them, made me feel sick.

But Ben pleaded. ""Please, Sav. It's my birthday. Just for a little while.""

So I went, trying to paste on a brave face, my artfully ripped jeans and band t-shirt feeling like a costume.

The loft was crowded, loud, filled with people trying too hard.

And then I saw them.

Jax, with Chloe Davenport draped on his arm.

She was beautiful, in a sharp, glossy way. Perfect hair, perfect clothes, a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.

They made a beeline for me. My stomach twisted.

""Savvy!"" Jax said, a little too brightly. ""So glad you could make it. There's someone I want you to meet.""

He gestured to Chloe. ""This is Chloe Davenport. My fiancée.""

Fiancée. The word hit me harder than I expected, even though I knew it was part of the script.

Chloe extended a perfectly manicured hand. Her grip was firm, cool.

""Jax has told me all about you, sweetie,"" she said, her voice dripping with condescension.

""It's cute you had a little crush, but he's a grown man now. We're even thinking about starting a family soon.""

She patted her flat stomach meaningfully.

""You'll find someone your own age, I'm sure.""


Chapter 3
I forced a smile. ""Congratulations, you two. I wish you all the best.""

My voice sounded surprisingly steady.

Jax looked relieved. Chloe's smile tightened, just a fraction.

Then Mark and Lee, Jax's bandmates, swaggered over, beers in hand.

""Hey, Savvy! Remember all those cookies you used to bake for us?"" Mark jeered.

""And those posters? 'The Night Howlers conquer Austin!'"" Lee added, mimicking a dramatic voice.

They laughed, loud and obnoxious.

""She was our number one fan girl, weren't you, Savvy?""

""Such an adorable crush,"" Mark said, winking at Chloe. ""Good thing our Jax is all grown up now.""

The industry types nearby chuckled.

I felt my face burn. Utterly, completely humiliated.

Jax just stood there, a faint, uncomfortable smirk on his face. He didn't say a word to stop them.

He didn't care.

It hit me then. All those years, his tolerance of my presence, my constant orbiting around him and the band, it was because of Ben.

Ben was his best friend, his bandmate. He put up with the little sister.

Now, he had Chloe. He didn't need to put up with me anymore.

He wanted me gone. This whole charade was to make sure of it.

I mumbled an excuse and turned away, needing to escape.

The sadness was a heavy weight in my ch**t, making it hard to breathe.

I found a quiet corner by a large window overlooking the city.

""Rough night?""

Chloe Davenport was beside me, holding two glasses of champagne. She offered one to me.

I shook my head. ""No, thank you.""

""Look,"" she said, her voice softer now, almost conspiratorial. ""Jax can be a bit of an i**ot. Those guys are j**ks. Don't let them get to you.""

I just looked at her.

""I meant what I said, Chloe. I'm happy for you both. I'm moving on with my life.""

She took a sip of her champagne, her eyes appraising me.

""Are you? You know, Jax talks in his sl**p sometimes. He used to mumble your name. A lot.""

My breath hitched. What was she playing at?

""He felt guilty, I think. Leading you on with that 'wait till you're twenty-two'crap.""

She shrugged. ""Or maybe he actually liked the attention from the sweet little art girl.""

Her smile was back, sharp and knowing.

Before I could respond, there was a sudden, loud creaking sound from above.

We both looked up.

A massive art installation, a heavy metal sculpture, was suspended from the ceiling.

It was swaying.

Dangerously.

People started to scream.

Instinctively, Jax, who had appeared from nowhere, grabbed Chloe, pulling her roughly out of the sculpture's direct path.

He didn't even glance my way.

The sculpture crashed down with a deafening roar of tortured metal and shattering plaster.

I wasn't directly under it, but a large, jagged piece broke off, spinning through the air.

Pain exploded in my leg, a searing, blinding agony.

Another blow near my collarbone.

Then, darkness.

I woke up in a hospital room.

The smell of antiseptic and fear.

Ben was there, his face pale, eyes red-rimmed.

""Savvy? Oh, God, Savvy, I'm so sorry."" He looked like he was about to cry.

""What happened?"" My voice was a croak.

""The sculpture... it fell. You got hit. Your leg is broken, pretty badly. And you have a deep cut here."" He gently touched his own collarbone.

He looked furious. ""Jax... he just stood there with Chloe. Didn't even look back after he pulled her clear.""

I processed that. Jax saved Chloe. Of course, he did. She was his fiancée, his future.

I was just... Savvy.

It didn't even hurt anymore, that realization. It was just a fact.

""It's okay, Ben,"" I whispered. ""He chose. It's fine.""

It solidified everything. My decision to leave.

Ben looked at me, his eyes full of a pain that mirrored my own, but also a simmering anger.

""It's not fine, Sav. None of this is fine.""

But I knew, with a chilling certainty, that it was over. Whatever I thought I had with Jax, whatever future I had dreamed of, was gone.

And I was strangely calm.

I was going to Florence. I would heal. I would build a new life.

1lox3xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design_WATC/comments/1lox3xw/this_font_duo_is_my_new_cheat_code_for_instant/,This font duo is my new cheat code for instant retro branding. Meet Peachy Rebels.,"Alright,

Let's be real. How much of your life have you wasted trying to pair a bold headline font with a script that doesn't look like it came from two different planets? The struggle is real. You find a great, chunky sans, but every script you try looks either too corporate or like a cheesy wedding invite.

https://preview.redd.it/5eoy9nq6d8af1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b1b7adbcd6c4c240fb87e8ee817f68adc4cb80e

So, I stumbled upon this duo from Creacy Studio called [Peachy Rebels](https://weandthecolor.com/peachy-rebels-font-creacy-studio/204213), and it's basically the pre-packaged answer to that problem. It's not just two fonts bundled together; they were clearly designed to be a perfect match from the start.

# The Two Sides of the Coin

Peachy Rebels is a duo, so you get two distinct styles in one pack:

**1. The ""Rebel"" - A Chunky, Confident Sans Serif**

First up, you've got the **bold, chunky uppercase sans serif**. This thing is an absolute unit. It’s got these soft, rounded edges that give it a super friendly, retro vibe. Think 70s record sleeves, vintage skate brands, and posters that needed to shout without being aggressive. It’s perfect for logos and headlines that you want people to notice immediately. It's strong but doesn't take itself too seriously.

**2. The ""Peachy"" - A Bubbly, Flowing Script**

Then there's its partner, a **super chill, bubbly lowercase script**. This is the ""peachy"" part. It has a genuine handwritten flow that feels natural and fun. It's not stiff or formal at all—it's got a bit of sass to it. It’s what you use for taglines, subheadings, or any little bit of text where you want to add a human touch.

**Bonus:** The script comes with ligatures and alternates, so you can avoid that repetitive font look and make it feel more custom. Huge plus.

# So, what's it actually good for?

This is where it gets fun. Because they work so well together, you can throw this duo at almost any project that needs some personality. Here are a few ideas off the top of my head:

* **Branding that pops:** Think logos for craft breweries, indie clothing lines, or that cool new coffee shop on the corner. The sans for the name, the script for the ""Est. 2024"" tagline. Done.
* **Social media graphics that don't suck:** Perfect for making quote graphics for Instagram that actually have some style. The contrast between the two fonts is a scroll-stopper.
* **Packaging with attitude:** Imagine this on a bag of coffee beans, a hot sauce label, or a box for a skincare product. It screams ""fun, quality, and not made by a giant corporation.""
* **Stickers and T-shirts:** This thing was BORN to be on a sticker or a shirt. The retro feel is perfect for merch.

# The Nerd Stuff (Specs)

For those who care about the technical details:

* You get **OTF, TTF, and WOFF** files. The WOFF files are key because they're optimized for the web, so your site won't lag.
* It has **multilingual support** for Latin-based languages.
* Like I mentioned, the script has **ligatures & alternates** to play with.

Anyway, just wanted to share this find with you all because I know the font-pairing struggle is universal. It feels like a solid tool to have in the kit for any project that needs a dose of retro charm without hours of searching.

My boyfriend has always had passwords on everything - his phone, his computer, and would never share them with me.

A few years ago, he asked some of my female friends (yes, friends I know personally) for pictures of their feet, saying he wanted to “compare them” to mine. A couple of them told me about it because they found it weird.

Later on, I caught him messaging another girl - planning to go to her house while telling me they were “just going for coffee.” I said it was inappropriate and I didn’t approve. Later I found out he had made excuses to the girl to cancel.

Recently, I found what seems to be his secret Reddit account. The name matches his other usernames. When I used password reset, the email was his.

I managed to access some of the deleted posts and what I saw… broke something in me.

1) He had posted pictures of his penis 
2) A dildo setup on a chair - very clearly used 
3) Photos he had taken of women’s feet on the street 
4) One of the feet photos showed a bunion that suspiciously looked like one of the girls he previously asked photos from 
5) He commented on hardcore fetish subreddits - including scat content 
6) He regularly commented under dildo-related threads, telling people how he uses it -while telling me it was “for us,” even though we never used it

When I confronted him, he said his “computer was hacked,” and that “he’s the real victim.” He denied everything, saying only one photo was his and that the rest was planted.

I don’t believe him. He plays the victim every time. He says he never cheated on me, and that I’m the one hurting him with my “accusations.”

I live with him. He refuses to let me go, guilt-trips me, tries to control how I move.

I know what I have to do. I just needed to share this. Because this man -who told me he loved me -was building a secret, fetish life behind my back while lying to my face.

He keeps saying he never cheated, swears on everything, cries, begs, says he’ll change and become the perfect man. But I’m not convinced. Everything is too clear, too real -and I’ve made up my mind. I’m leaving. There’s no going back.

My boyfriend has always had passwords on everything - his phone, his computer, and would never share them with me.

A few years ago, he asked some of my female friends (yes, friends I know personally) for pictures of their feet, saying he wanted to “compare them” to mine. A couple of them told me about it because they found it weird.

Later on, I caught him messaging another girl - planning to go to her house while telling me they were “just going for coffee.” I said it was inappropriate and I didn’t approve. Later I found out he had made excuses to the girl to cancel.

Recently, I found what seems to be his secret Reddit account. The name matches his other usernames. When I used password reset, the email was his.

I managed to access some of the deleted posts and what I saw… broke something in me.

1) He had posted pictures of his penis 
2) A dildo setup on a chair - very clearly used 
3) Photos he had taken of women’s feet on the street 
4) One of the feet photos showed a bunion that suspiciously looked like one of the girls he previously asked photos from 
5) He commented on hardcore fetish subreddits - including scat content 
6) He regularly commented under dildo-related threads, telling people how he uses it -while telling me it was “for us,” even though we never used it

When I confronted him, he said his “computer was hacked,” and that “he’s the real victim.” He denied everything, saying only one photo was his and that the rest was planted.

I don’t believe him. He plays the victim every time. He says he never cheated on me, and that I’m the one hurting him with my “accusations.”

We really liked the area when we went for viewings: it has a great mix of ethnic shops, excellent transport links into central London via Thameslink, and it’s within walking distance of the Northern line at Colliers Wood. Technically it’s Mitcham, but we’re much closer to Tooting Broadway, and we love the vibe along Mitcham Road—there are good coffee shops, a gym, and some great restaurants.

That said, we’ve had mixed reactions from people when we mention the area.

Of course, one of the big draws was affordability—flat prices were quite reasonable for Zone 3.

Well if you message me with the intent of building a romantic relationship (oh yeah..mmm...baby..) Id be open to that also. I really do want to have something that isn't a quick chat and forget. More so a bond, and texting every day type thing. So if that's not your kind of thing don't get my damn hopes up.

A little about me I guess. I will be attending college, majoring in wildlife biology. With that said I do really love animals. I'm a total nerd when it comes to zoology, Ive studied since I was young and it has been my ✨hyper fixation✨

I like to walk during my free time, and pay very close attention to my surroundings. If I see a butterfly or a lizard I instantly lose focus and I have to investigate, so normally my walks are very long. 

I do love gardening but my entire garden was demolished this summer by the heat. I tend to repair things when it cools down. I do love learning about plants and foraging is very fun for me. One mans weed is another mans treasure. Got dandelions? Give them to me, I love em. 

I drink tea and do drink making on a daily basis, drink crafting is another one of my hobbies. Coffee, tea, horchata, lemonade, hot cocoa you name it. I consider myself a professional. I love learning different cultures because it seems like every culture has their own special tea.

1lowysm,https://www.reddit.com/r/winemaking/comments/1lowysm/bentonite_messup_need_advice/,"Bentonite Mess-Up, Need Advice","I have little experience with wine making. My buddy and I got into making mead a couple of years ago, and he does most of the work. I mainly help out with expenses and fruit; we use plums from a small tree in my backyard. To the extent that I have helped, it's essentially just with the sanitization and mixing portion of the process. He handled the rest since he had all the equipment.

He had given me a couple of bottles from our most recent batch, which is probably our 3rd batch. This one turned out super thick and cloudy; we think we added way too much fruit and honey. It was very sweet and *very* alcoholic; the best measurement he could get put it at \~26% ABV. I mentioned trying some bentonite to clarify it, which he provided along with a 64-oz carboy for me to use.

Now I should have looked into how to do this properly before I did, or asked him since he probably knows, but here I am. I poured the clay directly into the carboy and did my best to stir it in with a long straw and some swirling, which wasn't very effective. I now know that I should have made a slurry with it first at the very least. I also added an *assload* of bentonite. I'm talking around 3-4 tablespoons.

It has been sitting in there with it for a couple of months now, which I know is typically far too long, but it did the job of clearing it up. Now I have another issue: I have what appears to be \~2 inches of clear wine at the top, and small clumps of sediment mixed in the rest of the way to the bottom.

At this point, I'm more concerned with saving as much liquid as possible and not so much with affecting the taste, as I'm sure the amount of bentonite has already greatly affected it. Essentially, I only want to get my money's worth out of it, even if it doesn't taste the best. With that said, after siphoning what I can from the top into a separate container, are there any good ways to filter any remaining liquid from the bentonite, even if it ends up aerating the wine?

Some thoughts I had were using coffee filters or something like that, unless there is a way to effectively break up the chunky clay and wine mixture into finer particulates that might help the remaining clay settle more compactly and release more of the wine. I had contemplated using an immersion blender to do this, knowing full well that it would oxidize any remaining wine.

1lowu6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrematureEjaculation/comments/1lowu6i/seen_improvement_by_personal_adaptation_and/,Seen improvement by personal adaptation and combining many ideas I got from this group,"Hi All.. 
  I have been part of this group for few months now. Seen many people facing similar issue as I have. I have premature ejaculation issue due to high sensitivity of the penis head/ glans(hyper sensitive), anxiety thinking about I will cum sooner, very rarely tiredness due to long activities in the day of sex. 
  As there is no cure for this issue, I started to try out everything as many people have tried here. Few stuffs helped ,some did not even make improvements. So I tried to address each of the issues separately and now able to delay the ejaculation a considerable amount of time.
  A short info about my condition - I am married and initial days before COVID days had a good health and still had PE but not severe. I can last long with numbing sprays. I always had hyper sensitive penis. That was the reason. 

 After COVID and past 2 years situation was worse maybe due migrating to a new country and my diet changes. Etc. Couldn't find exact reason. Then I joined this group and found many inputs and below I explain the stuff worked for me. 

1. Hyper sensitivity - Thought might be due to short frenulum, went to doctor and confirmed the same. Had circumcision 6 months ago. Sensitivity went down a little bit. Later started using clove oil combination suggested in the group and it worked. Weekly three days I apply it and the day of sex I apply in the evening or few hours before sex. It works good and not completely numb my penis.

2. Tiredness - I started to take vitamin and mineral supplements from DM (Germany). Also incorporated Shilajit with ashwagandha resin weekly 3 days or when I feel tired. This gave a huge boost in energy and I never felt lazy. Helped also with erection strength and libido.

3. Consistency of semen - when I went to india for vacation I met a ayurvedic doctor looking for a solution. 

He explained something which I seen no one talked in this group before(maybe I don't know). The consistency of semen is important. He gave example as to consider the semen as wax. When the body temperature is high the semen will flow faster. When body temperature is maintained correctly semen will get thicker and it will take more time to ejaculate. As the semen will be more sticky and thick. Watery semen will always ejaculate faster.

Solution he gave -
1. Badam Resin. 
          - Added few pieces in water and let it overnight. Jelly kind of transparent stuffs is made . Taking it everyday morning in milk and honey to reduce body heat and semen thickness. (It definitely works 🤞🏼😊)
2. Orithal thamari (Hybanthus powder) 
         - I could find this in India. Not in Germany. I tried it when I was in india and man it made me super horny. (Take this only if you have gf or married). Sexual thoughts and libido was too much. But it helped a bit. 
3. Mucuna pruriens
         - I did try this only for a month and I could say combination with other stuffs it worked and I was able to penetrate without condoms for few mins. 

The below stuffs I tried on my own from seeing YouTube and instagram.


4. Beetroot juice
         - I still follow this everyday. I get bio beet juice from Aldi Germany. ( I couldn't find this in other supermarket) This gave huge boost for my erection strength and I felt my penis size slightly bigger than usual. 

5. Correct condom size
         - I always used to take normal standard size from shops and it was always tight and restricted my blood flow. Tried to order a bit larger size in Amazon(57mm). It fit perfectly now and I don't have the pain or tightness below. This also contributed to my improvement.

6. Definitive guide
       - tried for 2 weeks. Initially I was able to understand my arousal levels and made my erection strength more. But later it made the problem worse. So I stopped it and  it might work for others. 

7. Quit porn and masturbation 

8. Cold shower before sex
     - This made my body temperature lower and also relaxed. So five to 10 min in cold shower. It takes more time for body to attain high temperature during sex. Prolonging the ejaculation.

9. Cut down sugar, tea/coffee
      - not sure if this also helped. But my mind was peaceful and had good sleep recently. Having tea or coffee made my mind over stimulate.

I now able to last more than 10 or 15 min with condoms. Just wanted to help others. If this works for you then all the best. Let me know if you need more info in comments.

1lowsw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lowsw0/a_different_way_to_look_at_breakups_that_actually/,A Different Way to Look at Breakups (That Actually Helped Me Let Go),"So I've been sitting with something lately that completely shifted the way I see breakups ~ and honestly, life itself. I want to share it in case it helps anyone else out there who's hurting.

We often take a breakup as the ultimate rejection. Like we weren’t enough. Like something is wrong with us. But here’s the truth I landed on recently ~ nothing lasts forever. Literally nothing.

Tell me one thing that truly, permanently lasts. Relationships, jobs, homes, feelings, even our bodies ~ all temporary. Even we are temporary. We don’t own anything. Not people. Not love. Not time. It all belongs to something far bigger than us. The universe lets us borrow experiences, connections, moments… and when it’s time, we have to give them back.

It’s not personal. If someone changes their mind about us, that’s not our fault. It’s just a sign that the story between us was ready to turn a page. Trying to hold onto something the universe is ready to let go of only creates more pain. I used to beg for things to go back to how they were. Now I remind myself ~ it’s not rejection, it’s redirection.

Let me give you an example.

My ex and I were together for nearly three years. I thought it was the real deal. But one day, he told me he just ""wasn’t feeling it anymore."" I spiralled. I replayed every conversation, tried to find out what I did wrong, obsessed over who he might be seeing now. I made it all about me. My worth. My failure. My rejection.

But then, something shifted. I was walking home one day and I looked up at a tree. The leaves were falling. It was beautiful ~ and temporary. That tree didn’t panic. It didn’t try to glue the leaves back on. It let go. Because that’s what nature does. It trusts the cycle.

I started trusting it too.

I found this book called [Bossing Your Gratitude](https://amzn.to/4esF8fP)(highly recommend ~ seriously, it changed my perspective). It helped me focus on what’s still here. What’s real and solid in my life right now ~ without him in it. I started writing down three things every morning that I do have. Some days it was simple stuff: my bed, my coffee, my sister’s stupid jokes. But it helped me anchor myself in the now. Not the past. Not the ""what ifs.""

Gratitude doesn’t erase the pain, but it does soften it. It makes you realise you were whole before him. You’re still whole now.

So if you’re reading this and feeling that gut-wrenching ache ~ just remember: this pain is temporary. You are not broken. You are just in the middle of a shift. Something new is coming, but only if you’re willing to unclench your fists and stop trying to hold onto what is already gone.

Let it go. Let it hurt. Let it teach you.

You don’t need to be chosen by someone else to be enough … You already are.

~

Would love to hear if anyone else has experienced this kind of perspective shift. What helped you finally let go?

I wanted to share my experience with the Lelit MaraX, which I used as my main machine from 2021 to 2025. Before that, I had a modded Gaggia Classic from 2018 to 2021 — equipped with a PID and a spring mod for 9-bar pressure.

When I switched to the MaraX, I expected a clear upgrade in terms of espresso quality. Over time, I even invested in things like the Weber Unibasket and which didn’t exist back when I had the Gaggia. Despite all that, I could never quite dial in the flavor I wanted on the MaraX. The shots often tasted slightly off — missing punch I was used to with the Gaggia Classic. I experimented with different brew temperatures, flushing routines, and both brew modes. I even had the pump replaced in 2024 and fully serviced, but nothing really transformed the experience. Looking back, I’d honestly say the MaraX gave me worse-tasting shots than the Gaggia, which surprised me.

That said, it wasn’t all bad. In terms of workflow and usability, the MaraX is fantastic. It’s much easier to use than the Gaggia Classic, and the ability to steam and brew at the same time is a real plus. Steam pressure is stronger than the GC, recovery is quick, and the E61 design gives it a classic look that fits beautifully on a coffee bar. For milk drinks or daily use, it’s a very forgiving and beginner-friendly machine with a shorter learning curve than the Gaggia Classic. 

I'm curious, do other people experience similar experience with the MaraX that both had a fully modded Gaggia Classic and MaraX?",6,1751360428.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

The four astronauts from the shuttle Endeavour will be making the necessary repairs, and eventually the pictures from the Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe.",2,1751360364.0,RawEnglish,0,1.0,False
1lowrvy,https://v.redd.it/87o2r9uy88af1,"Barista Pro - hot steam, but not hot water.","I dismantled this Sage Barista Pro to descale the ""Thermoblock""(?), as the steam wand and hot water spout did not work at all anymore. It fully clogged with scale. 

Before dismantling it, it already happened a few rare times, that it would not create hot water for the coffee.

Now that I put it back together, as you can see in the video:

1. Steam wand works every time and creates hot steam
2. Hot water spout works, but water is cold
3. Water for portafilter works too, but also cold

Further observation:

* After having used the steam wand, the first few drops coming out hot water spout are still hot - residual heat from using the steam wand first.
* After using the 1cup/2cup function, it beeps 3 times. What does it mean?
* Machine will create hot coffee/hot water once in a while, for example after leaving the machine for a day and trying next day. It will do it exactly once, then back to being cold. This rules out that I confused the tubing when putting it back together.

I'm really at a loss here. Obviously, the heater works perfectly, creating the steam. I need some inspiration on the possible faults before I take it apart again.",2,1751360329.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

A lot has changed on [YouTube](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/) over the years, but one thing hasn’t: people still want simple, useful content. And now, with the tools available in 2025, making [YouTube](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/) videos is easier than ever.

I’ve been making content for a long time, and I can honestly say you don’t need a professional studio or a high-end camera to get started.

What really matters is having something helpful or interesting to share—and knowing how to put it together in a way that feels real. That’s what this post is all about.

I’ll walk you through the simplest way to make [YouTube](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/) videos this year, even if you’ve never made one before. No complicated [software](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-started-in-tech-with-no-experience/), no confusing steps. Just clear, practical advice you can follow today.

# How Do I Create YouTube Videos?

# Step 1: Start With an Idea That Solves a Problem

Before you even hit record, figure out what you want to talk about. You don’t need to reinvent anything—just answer a question someone might search on [YouTube](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/).

For example:

* “How to make iced coffee at home”
* “Simple way to track expenses with Google Sheets”
* “How I lost 10 pounds walking every day”

People are looking for honest, straightforward content. If you’ve solved a problem or learned something useful, that’s your video idea right there.

**Hey There!**

*Tired of empty promises and endless hustles? learn how to turn your skills and passions into your first $1,000 online. Stop dreaming, start earning.*

**Get Started -**  [**bit.ly/systemeioaffiliatez**](http://bit.ly/systemeioaffiliatez)

**Tip**: Go to [YouTube](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/) and type in part of your idea to see what autocomplete suggests. Those are real things people are searching for.

# Step 2: Use Your Phone (Yes, It’s Good Enough)

You don’t need a DSLR or a webcam. Most smartphones today shoot in 1080p or even 4K, which is more than enough for [YouTube](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/).

Here’s what I recommend:

* Use the back camera (it’s usually better quality than the front)
* Shoot in natural light (like near a window)
* Hold your phone steady or use a cheap tripod (you can get one for under $10)

If you’re filming your screen (like a tutorial or explainer), free tools like [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) or [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) let you record without much setup.

# Step 3: Keep It Simple and Real

Don’t overthink it. Your video doesn’t have to be perfect. In fact, most people prefer real videos over ones that feel too polished or scripted.

Here’s what helps:

* Speak like you’re talking to a friend
* Keep your video under 8 minutes if you’re just starting out
* Use simple language, no need to sound like a presenter

If you make a mistake while filming, just pause and say it again. You can cut out that part later. Which brings me to the next step…

# Step 4: Edit With Free Tools (No Experience Needed)

Editing used to be complicated. Now, not so much.

If you’re on a phone:

* Use **CapCut** or **InShot** (both are free and super beginner-friendly)

If you’re on a laptop:

* Try **Clipchamp** (free and built into Windows)
* Or **iMovie** if you’re on a Mac

You can trim mistakes, add text, and even throw in some background music. Don’t worry about making it look “professional.” Clean and clear is enough.

**Where to get free music**:

* [YouTube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music)
* [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/)

# Step 5: Write a Good Title and Thumbnail

Your video won’t get clicks if no one knows what it’s about. A good title and thumbnail can make all the difference.

**For your title:**

* Make it specific: “How I Save $500/Month Using This Budget App”
* Use numbers if possible
* Avoid clickbait—trust me, people are tired of it

**For your thumbnail:**

* Use a clear photo of you or a screenshot from the video
* Add big, bold text with a few words
* Free tools like **Canva** or **Photopea** can help

According to [Tubics](), videos with a clear title and thumbnail get **2x more clicks** than those without.

# Step 6: Upload, Add a Description, and Hit Publish

Once your video is ready, go to [YouTube](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/), click the upload button, and follow the steps. It’s pretty straightforward.

In the description:

* Include a short summary of the video
* Add helpful links if needed
* Put your social links or email if you want people to reach you

Tags aren’t super important anymore, but you can still add a few relevant ones just in case.

# Step 7: Share It—But Don’t Spam

After uploading, share the video with a few people who might find it helpful. If you’re part of a [Facebook](https://tchelete.com/how-to-grow-your-business-on-facebook/) group, Discord server, or Reddit community related to your topic, share it there—but only if it adds value.

You can also post a clip or quote from the video on [Instagram](https://tchelete.com/how-to-grow-your-business-on-instagram/), Twitter, or [TikTok](https://tchelete.com/how-to-grow-your-business-on-tiktok/) to get more reach.

# Step 8: Learn and Improve With Each Video

Your first video won’t be perfect—and that’s okay. You’ll get better each time.

Check your [**YouTube**](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/) **Analytics** after a few days to see how your video is doing:

* Are people clicking?
* Are they watching to the end?
* What parts are they skipping?

Use this info to improve your next one. That’s how creators grow—step by step.

# FAQs

# Do I need to show my face in the video?

Not at all. Many successful YouTubers use voiceover with screen recordings, slides, or stock footage.

# How often should I post?

Once a week is great, but even once every two weeks is okay. Focus on quality and consistency.

# What if I have a small audience?

Everyone starts small. Focus on making helpful videos. People will find you over time.

# Can I use AI tools to speed up the process?

Yes! Tools like [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) help with editing using text, and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) can help you write your script or video ideas.

# Final Thoughts

[YouTube](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/) doesn’t need to feel overwhelming. In 2025, you can start creating videos with just your phone, a clear idea, and a bit of patience. You don’t need to be famous, rich, or tech-savvy. You just need to start.

Your voice matters. And there’s someone out there who’s searching for exactly what you have to share.

1lowqrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HenryStickmin/comments/1lowqrr/escaping_the_prison_successful_options_but_they/,Escaping the Prison Successful Options but they are Fails,"# Sneaky Escapist

**File**

Henry retrieves the file from the mysterious cake and attempts to use it to saw through the bars of his cell. However, the file is dull and snaps in half after a single stroke, leaving Henry with a useless piece of metal. Frustrated, he throws it on the ground, accidentally triggering a hidden pressure plate in the cell. The floor opens, dropping Henry into a pit of stale prison porridge below. *(Fail Message: Who puts a trapdoor under porridge? That's just cruel!)*

**Cell Door**

Using the file, Henry tries to saw off a metal bar from the cell door. He manages to loosen it, but the bar slips from his grip and flies out, striking a passing guard's coffee mug. The scalding coffee splashes onto an alarm panel, short-circuiting it and triggering a lockdown. Sirens blare as guards swarm the cell, tackling Henry to the ground. *(Fail Message: Next time, maybe don't weaponize the coffee break.)*

**Click! (left)**

Henry swings the metal bar at Rupert Price as he charges. Unfortunately, Rupert ducks at the last second, and Henry's swing misses, throwing him off balance. He stumbles into a wall, knocking himself out cold. Rupert stands over him, shaking his head in disappointment. *(Fail Message: Swing and a miss! Maybe stick to batting practice.)*

**Click! (right)**

As Dave Panpa rushes toward Henry, he swings the metal bar again. This time, the bar gets caught in an overhead light fixture, yanking it from Henry's hands. The light crashes down, electrocuting Henry and leaving him twitching on the floor as Dave casually tasers him for good measure. *(Fail Message: Lights out, Henry. Literally and figuratively.)*

**Chair**

Henry drags a chair under the vent in the closet and climbs up to enter it. However, the chair is rickety and collapses under his weight, sending him crashing to the floor. The noise alerts the two officers outside, who burst in and find Henry tangled in the chair's remains, promptly arresting him. *(Fail Message: IKEA's prison furniture line: stylish, but not escape-proof.)*

**Right**

Crawling to the right in the vent, Henry reaches a section overlooking the prison roof. Excited, he moves too quickly and dislodges a loose vent panel, falling through and landing in the middle of a guard training session. The recruits, eager to prove themselves, dogpile Henry before he can react. *(Fail Message: Surprise! You just enrolled in Guard Tackling 101.)*

**Plungers**

Henry grabs the twin plungers and starts descending the prison wall. Halfway down, one plunger loses suction and pops off, causing him to swing wildly. He tries to stick it back on but accidentally slaps it onto a window, alerting a guard inside who shoots through the glass, hitting Henry. *(Fail Message: Plungers: great for toilets, terrible for stealth.)*

# Lawyered Up

**Cellphone**

Henry pulls out the cellphone from the cake and dials his attorney, Felix White. However, the phone has no signal in the prison's thick walls. Desperate, Henry climbs onto his bunk to get a better signal, only to slip and drop the phone into the toilet. As he reaches for it, a guard spots him and assumes he's hiding contraband, leading to his transfer to solitary confinement. *(Fail Message: No bars, no escape. Better luck with carrier pigeons.)*

**Disguising Bag**

In court, Felix White presents the disguising bag as evidence, arguing that Henry couldn't have tied the knot from inside. However, Winston Davis counters by producing security footage showing Henry tying the bag himself before hiding. The judge, unimpressed, declares Henry guilty of perjury on top of his other charges, sending him back to jail with an extended sentence. *(Fail Message: Nice try, Felix. Next time, check the tapes first.)*

# Badass Bust Out

**Drill**

Henry uses the drill from the cake to bore through the cell floor, aiming for the bathroom below. The drill overheats and jams, creating a loud screech that echoes through the prison. Guards trace the noise to Henry's cell, break down the door, and find him stuck in a half-drilled hole, unable to move. *(Fail Message: Drill sergeant's gonna have a field day with you.)*

**Crowbar**

In the bathroom, Henry grabs a crowbar to pry open a drain cover. He applies too much force, and the crowbar snaps, sending a jagged piece flying into a water pipe. The room fills with water, trapping Henry as guards arrive to find him floundering in the flooded bathroom. *(Fail Message: Plumber's bill is on you, Henry.)*

**Down**

As Henry runs from officers Burt Slim and Tom Hardly, he dodges left to avoid their bullets. However, he misjudges his path and slides into a janitor's closet, crashing into a stack of cleaning supplies. A bottle of bleach spills, creating a noxious cloud that knocks him out, allowing the officers to cuff him easily. *(Fail Message: Dodged the bullets, choked on the bleach. Smooth move.)*

**Left**

Approaching a wall while being chased, Henry attempts to use it to hop over Tom Hardly. He miscalculates the jump and lands directly on Tom, who instinctively grabs Henry in a headlock. Burt catches up, and the two officers drag Henry back to his cell. *(Fail Message: Parkour's not your thing, huh?)*

**Click!**

Facing Captain Ed Roberts in a standoff, Henry tries to dodge the bullets and throw one back. He catches a bullet but fumbles it, accidentally tossing it upward. The bullet hits a ceiling fan, which breaks and falls, pinning Henry to the ground as Roberts and the other officers close in. *(Fail Message: Bullet juggling? Stick to spoons, Henry.)*",3,1751360202.0,HenryStickmin,0,1.0,False

What I discovered destroyed my trust.,"We’ve been together for 6 years, living together  for almost 5. My boyfriend has always had passwords on everything — his phone, his computer, and would never share them with me.

A few years ago, he asked some of my female friends (yes, friends I know personally) for pictures of their feet, saying he wanted to “compare them” to mine. A couple of them told me about it because they found it weird.

Later on, I caught him messaging another girl — planning to go to her house while telling me they were “just going for coffee.” I said it was inappropriate and I didn’t approve. Later I found out he had made excuses to the girl to cancel.

Recently, I found what seems to be his secret Reddit account. The name matches his other usernames. When I used password reset, the email was his.

I managed to access some of the deleted posts and what I saw… broke something in me.

▪ He had posted pictures of his penis ▪ A dildo setup on a chair — very clearly used ▪ Photos he had taken of women’s feet on the street ▪ One of the feet photos showed a bunion that suspiciously looked like one of the girls he previously asked photos from ▪ He commented on hardcore fetish subreddits — including scat content ▪ He regularly commented under dildo-related threads, telling people how he uses it — while telling me it was “for us,” even though we never used it

When I confronted him, he said his “computer was hacked,” and that “he’s the real victim.” He denied everything, saying only one photo was his and that the rest was planted.

I don’t believe him. He plays the victim every time. He says he never cheated on me, and that I’m the one hurting him with my “accusations.”

I live with him. He refuses to let me go, guilt-trips me, tries to control how I move.

I know what I have to do. I just needed to share this. Because this man — who told me he loved me — was building a secret, fetish life behind my back while lying to my face.

He keeps saying he never cheated, swears on everything, cries, begs, says he’ll change and become the perfect man. But I’m not convinced. Everything is too clear, too real — and I’ve made up my mind. I’m leaving. There’s no going back.

My father, who didn't have work and didn't have a car, used to take me by bus. The lessons where in an arts center. As it was out of town, he would stay around during the lessons and then my mom would picked both up to come back to town.

The teacher (40M) groomed me. I had very strong feelings for him and even gave him my drawings that took me a lot of time and effort. It never got to the point of physical contact.At some point, a female teacher started to get suspicious of our bond and talked to me. I was too afraid to say anything but I asked my parents to stop going and they made me go one last time out of ""politeness"" and that one time the teacher tried to guilt me back to his lessons and then proceed to mistreat me the remaining time of the lesson. 

The thing is, the male teacher talked with my dad a lot. I remember them on a corner discussing and laughing. Afterwards, my dad would leave to have a coffee and he used to say he didn't want me to feel watched or controlled during the whole lesson. I thought my dad was so cool and understanding, he gave me freedom and privacy to explore. After he left, the other kids would go to play together and I stayed behind drawing and talking to the male teacher who used to quote or discuss whatever book my dad was reading at the time and say things or behave in a way my dad would. 

I always blamed the teacher for the grooming. But recently my older sister told me she was SAd by our dad and she's just remembering, she had blocked everything and she was less than 8yo. I don't remember anything but now I'm wondering if he(dad) was indeed conscious about the situation with the teacher and he enabled him?

1lowmgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1lowmgg/living_in_a_nightmare/,Living In a Nightmare,"TW: emotional abuse. 
This is very long. If you don't like long stories, this is one to skip. So, I've been married for 10 years. My husband and I share 2 children with complex special needs. I have been their primary caregiver their entire lives, which I love very much. They make me so happy. I do need a break sometimes, but it's not because of them, it's because I just need a break like any human being would. 


For years my husband and I haven't gotten along. It wasn't until a therapist told him that I needed breaks that he decided he would allow me to have them. Before the therapist told him that I needed breaks, he said if I ever needed to leave the house that I needed to take the children with me to give him some chill out time. It's very hard to take our children places alone because they are both in wheelchairs. 


So for the past several years my husband has been emotionally abusive. He told me that he was only with me because he wanted to see his children every day. When he doesn't get what he wants from me, he punishes me by withholding help. I do basically everything alone. He works 40 hours a week at a desk job but he likes to come home and put his feet up like he's been out digging ditches all day. Yes I understand how disrespectful that sounds of me to say. 


I do all of the housework. He helps feed one of the kids if he is in the mood. In the past few years he started helping with baths because they have gotten pretty heavy and hard for me to lift in and out of the tub. He changes diapers maybe once a day. Twice if he's feeling extra helpful. Some days he is gone from sun up until bedtime, having fun, getting his time off to unwind. This leaves me alone. When I get a break it's only for a few hours. I come home and he has not done any housework. 


I did tell him at one point that him not helping around the house made me bitter towards him. He started helping for a little while. A few months maybe. Small chores like unloading the dishwasher, running the vacuum. Nothing major. Then he decided he shouldn't have to do those things. 


He speaks hatefully to me. He screams. He curses. He slams doors. He says I nag him. When he helps with the kids he says he is doing my job for me. 


To the outside world he is the best dad, such a great husband, and I should be so lucky to have him. His family won't believe me when I tell them how he is behind closed doors. They tell me I'm lying. 
Most of his family don't treat our children like they exist. We see them on major holidays but that's about it. They don't call, they don't FaceTime, they don't visit. They drive past our house several times a day. His parents drive past our house on their way to see their other grandkids but they don't stop to say hi to my kids. 


I recently made a Facebook post for one of my kids birthdays. I tagged everyone that got them a gift or called or came by to visit. I didn't tag anyone in his family. I was making a point that I notice how they mistreat my kids and it is hurtful to me. The post made them outraged. They said it was a public attack on their family, even though I didn't say one bad thing about them. I simply didn't tag them. 
They came to my house and screamed at me for 2 hours. They insulted me, my character, my parenting, it was awful. I cried for a week after and could barely eat. A few weeks ago one of them texted and said something about going to get coffee with me, which is random because they never ask me to do anything with them. Ever. I didn't reply and I cried for 2 days. It was very very traumatizing to sit through. My husband was in the room while it was happening, encouraging it. He said I deserved it. Later when I told him how badly I was hurt by it, he said I deserved it for posting stupid things on Facebook and if I did it again he would invite them back over to scream at me some more. 


Fast forward to now. I started having seizures a couple of weeks ago. They have run tons of tests. All normal. They said it could be from stress and lack of sleep. 
My husband stepped up for the first week. He actually had me convinced that he might care. That lasted about a week. Then he started being hateful again. I was supposed to be resting and not doing much. I can't care for my kids alone because they are still adjusting my medications. If you know anything about seizure medications, they have some bad side effects. I'm not allowed to drive. He says I sleep too much. He says I'm not lifting a finger to help him with the kids. That's not true.  I'm keeping the housework done and I'm helping with the kids just as much or more than he used to help me. 
I don't want his family coming over to help. After how they spoke to me I don't even want to look at them. He yelled at me about that. He said I'm disgusting to refuse help at a time like this. 


I'm supposed to have limited stress right now but he has caused me so much stress in the last few weeks. It's like he's almost doing it on purpose. It will get to the point that I'm crying and he will mock me for crying and say it's my fault. 
Now that he's having to do so much childcare, people are wanting to help him. They are praising him. Saying he needs a break. Saying he has so much on his plate. 


Where were my breaks? Where was my praise? Where was my help? Im bitter about the whole thing. I'm bitter about my new health problems. I'm bitter about my marriage. I'm bitter about his family. I'm bitter that my friends, who I thought were friends and I always helped in times of need, have not checked on me or offered to help. I know I'm having a pity party but I literally have no one to talk to. I've looked into leaving. It's gonna be a long process since my kids are so dependent on me and I can't work a typical job. Some states offer caregiver pay and I'm getting information about that. 
I just feel deflated. I feel so so hurt. I have cried so much. There's alot more I could write, but for right now that's all I have in me. I've never written on Reddit before. I'm kind of nervous that I will get a lot of mean comments. I guess I'll see how it goes. ",1,1751359700.0,Divorce,2,1.0,False
1lowm9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1lowm9b/how_do_you_deal_with_a_manchild/,How do you deal with a man-child?,"I (24F) went on a date with a man-child coworker (23M) just to get him to stop asking.


A few months ago, I joined a large agency. It was my first time working in a big shit creative agency. I was new, overwhelmed, and just trying to survive.

During one of the first office hangouts, I met this guy let’s call him AJ. He was wearing a Swiggy delivery jacket as a joke. I remember looking at him and thinking, “He’s too polished to be a delivery guy,” which he caught and laughed at. That was our first actual exchange. I casually asked him if he sings, he asked me “Why’d ask that” and I said “You got a nice voice” (I was very serious here, and not flirtatious) 

Apparently, that one compliment was enough for him to latch on.

The very next day, he asked for my number and before I could say anything, he pulled it from our office WhatsApp group without my consent. He also stalked my Instagram even though I hadn’t shared it with him. He started messaging me constantly asking me out for coffee, lunch, dinner, hangouts after work.

I said no to everything, consistently and politely. But he just would not stop. Every day, a new excuse to text or corner me at work. I didn’t want to be rude, I was still new and didn’t want to create unnecessary awkwardness but he kept pushing.

Eventually (after a month or so), I said yes to a movie. Not because I wanted to go — I didn’t. I just thought if I gave him that one chance, he’d finally leave me alone. I was tired and honestly just wanted it to stop. Also I kinda felt guilty for some reason. 

The date was horrible. He showed up high, red eyes, reeking of weed. Afterward, we grabbed food. There all he did was talk about his exes, his childhood trauma, how many girls he dated, how he even dated an actress but she turned bi and I was like Ok?!? And I dropped multiple hints that I wanted to go home. Told him it was getting late. Said my mom was calling. Even stood up to leave.

He ignored everything. Brushed it off with jokes. At one point, he said, “Let me talk to your mom, I’ll tell her I’m taking care of her daughter.” I was creeped out.

When we finally left the restaurant, I walked to my car, got in, and even started it. He walked up and literally stopped me from leaving. Then stood around outside smoking a cigarette and dragging the goodbye for another 20 minutes while I stood there, deeply uncomfortable.

He kept texting afterward. Begged me to watch Minions with him insisted on coming to my house late at night. I said no. He pushed. “Your family’s in town? So what?” When that didn’t work, he asked if we could FaceTime and watch it together. I kept refusing, but he wouldn’t let it go. Eventually, just to make it stop, I gave in once. And that was my mistake. I thought giving him closure would end it. Instead, it made him believe he had access.

And then it crossed into another line of disrespect.

And when I eventually ended all of it by saying “ I can’t do this, I don’t want any part of this”. He had the audacity to ask me “like you don’t want a part of this ever? Like you know I can easily pester you but I don’t. Are you sure, you don’t want this?” And I said “Yes, I don’t”

Things just escalated after this. 

He found my private YouTube channel something I use to post skits and reaction videos, a space I deliberately keep away from work. He not only watched it, but loudly called it out in front of the whole creative team: “Your video popped up in my recommendations,” he smirked. Everyone turned to look. He knew exactly what he was doing.

After that, the taunts started.

He gave me a made-up nickname from one of my videos “Jabudaya.” Said I looked like a 14-year-old boy. Mocked my work. Interrupted shoots I was leading. Tried to outtalk me in meetings. When I told him to stop, he said it was all just “fun.” But it never felt like fun. It felt targeted.

One time, right after lunch, he looked straight at me from across the room and yelled, “Catch!” then threw two rotis at me wrapped in foil. I was shocked and disgusted. I didn’t catch them. He walked over, placed them on my desk, and said, “If you don’t want them, feed them to the dogs.”

I told him, “I’m not taking that. Keep it away from me.”

He just smirked and said, “Well, J asked me to give it to you, so if you have something to say, go talk to her,” and walked away like it was all one big joke.

There were people around. I felt humiliated.

This is someone who brags about drinking, smokes weed constantly, and once told me, “I can’t even poop without smoking first.” He trauma-dumps constantly. Talks about how no girl sticks around. On our one and only date, he told me about how he’d tried to get with other women at work too.

After me, he moved on to an intern. Then another girl.

Why am I sharing this?

Because for the longest time, I thought maybe I was overreacting. Maybe I should’ve been firmer. Maybe it was my fault for saying yes to that one date. But here’s the thing I said no over and over again. He didn’t care. He took my number without consent. He stalked my social media. He mocked me publicly. I tried to keep the peace, and he took that as an invitation.

I’m done trying to justify my boundaries.

If anyone out there has ever felt like they were “too polite” or “too nice” to be taken seriously you’re not the problem. The person ignoring your boundaries is.

1lowkjl,http://archivum-imperialis.co.uk/,Introducing the Black Library Reading Tracker!,"(note I spoke with u/Parkerm1408 before posting this, as I do have affiliate linking in this)

I've been building a Warhammer Reading Tracker. I've already been using it myself, and have shared it in a handful of groups for feedback.

It is still a work in progress...things that require some work include...

* Adding the rest of the books and series.
* Adding in the rest of the cover art.
* Adding in additional achievements.
* Some achievement related bugs.
* Some performance fixes (swapping between settings has a lot of slowdown).
* And Polishing off Affiliate Linking in the hopes it pays for hosting.

Huge thanks to u/dauntlessk2 for their Horus Heresy Interactive Flowchart, u/elling83 for their Post-Rift Reading Order Guide, and u/dima170104 for their Horus Heresy Book Checklists, that have variously served as tools I've used myself, inspiration, and guidance.

**A few q's**

**I*****s this free?***  
Yes! I put in both affiliate linking and ""buy me a coffee"" links for people who would like to support me here, and I've thought a bit about what would a 'Premium' feature set look like, but the reality is...this is a sub 10k subreddit. I don't think it's worth trying to turn this into a commercial venture, and if I did, I'm sure Games Workshop would be displeased.

***Why did you build this?***  
Because I thought u/elling83's Post-Rift Reading Order Guide was really cool, and thought that Goodreads sucked a bit for this purposed. I built it because I wished someone else already had, and if I'm the only one who uses it, then great!

***What did you use to build it?***  
I used AI rapid prototyping tools to build an MVP, then fixed the issues with it. I've previously been a Software Engineer (although am no longer a 9-5 hands on dev), which helped both in getting the most out of AI to build something not terrible, and to fix up the inevitable issues myself. The bulk of the actual effort is data entry, and despite some trying, I needed to do it manually. I am also aware of, and have accounted for, the widely publicised security issues that come with using AI dev tools. 

***Is it safe to use? Are my details safe?***  
It only takes Email/Password, there's no payment processing, and you shouldn't be reusing passwords anyway. THAT SAID yes, if you use an email/password rather than google authentication, I can't go view your password.

***Will you be adding more books and series?***  
Yup. I aim to add \*every novel\*. Won't always bother with short stories, anthologies, e.t.c though.

***What do you read, and what do you play?***  
I've been reading both 40k and AoS, have finished the Horus Heresy on Audible, and have not read a single book from The World that Was. I play AoS when I can, both Soulblight Gravelords and Flesh Eater Courts (what can I say, I like mindless hordes), and have been dabbling with Kill Team.",10,1751359482.0,Blacklibrary,7,0.81,False

It is a fairly big office and our business unit has one floor assigned with open space, no cubicles or personal rooms. All desks are first come first served but of course we tend to sit at the same desk whenever we are working from the office. 
I work from the office 2 to 3 times per week and I am always leaving my desk immaculate before going home. However, during the day I am messy. I have a lot of stuff on my desk, I just scatter stuff on the desk as I arrive and just work. I use some stuff but some stuff just stay there. I always been like this, even in my previous job my former colleagues joked about me being an extremely meticulous project manager but a chaos goblin on my desk. 
Several times a colleague made remarks on this. Bear in mind I am not using two desk, or leaving stuff around the office. 
She works in the same field as me but I am senior and has to take over some of her work. I felt since this, I am now insufferable to her and the remarks increased. At first they were usual as ""oh you are messy but your files are the most pristine ever "" but then they became more derogatory and today I snapped. She said something along the lines of ""I would never work decently with mess around maybe this will show sooner or later in your work"" 
I told her to mind her own business because my own desk being messy is not any of her business. She said she was just joking to which I said it was not funny and just petty, a useless remark. ""Oh it is a joke just laugh about"".
I insisted it is not funny at all and she should stay with her nose on her own desk. 
Lastly she said I should make an effort to keep my desk tidy because some people don't like it. 
There I said that I don't care because it is their problem if they are offended by other people's desk, and told her to shut up or I will talk to my lead first and HR after. 

For context this is what I have on my desk on top of screen, laptop, mouse and keyboard: water bottle, coffee cup, pill holder, pen holder, pens, headset, 2 eyeglasses, a glass, my journals, a note pad, a hand lotion, a tiny bag and a shawl. That's it.  It really could sound a lot as other in the office only have laptop and barely a pen but I cannot really revolve my head around how this could be anyone else issue.

As I was setting this up, I remembered that I also had a Panagor Macro PMC 90mm and a Leica Elmar 9cm 1:4 and added them.

The experiment was done with an SL Typ 601 set on a tripod. Focus was in all cases on the coffee beams in front. Two sets of settings were used:

* ISO 200, 1/100s shutter speed, maximum aperture for each lens
* ISO 200, balanced shutter speed for maximum aperture for each lens

Results...

First go:

[Leica Elmar 1\/100s f4](https://preview.redd.it/1jy3ld3az7af1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=567505ddb4e331496fbc3c5c78da157af7065346)

The Elmar is much too slow for this setting, as expected. The bokeh balls, at f4, are small and fairly flat.

[Jupiter 9 1\/100s f2](https://preview.redd.it/l3cgg2zcz7af1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=630a4173a9f6760bbc702e84d0b3bb66f8236099)

The Jupiter was the base setting for the 1/100s and, reasonably enough, provides cleanest and brightest result. The bokeh balls are largish, slightly outlined and much more numerous.

[Panagor 1\/100s f2.8](https://preview.redd.it/ufw20yrgz7af1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7612e5b2bce74e5e4d9ac045a36481078023cb5f)

The Panagor is dark at this setting. Bokeh balls are significantly bubblish, but overlapping balls are not clear.

[TTartisan 1\/100s f2.8](https://preview.redd.it/06acq11k08af1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a9ebce3993315db3a900c440f10543581cde867)

The Trioplan clone has significant vignetting (which does not necessarily detract) and, as expected, is as dark as the Panagor. The bokeh balls are bubblish and overlapping ones provide a clear border even when overlapped. They are also slightly larger than the Panagor ones.

Second go:

[Elmar 1\/20s f4](https://preview.redd.it/veypv62y08af1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f06b15cf537933fb21a7d07be95778fbc15510e)

Sharp and clear beans. Bokeh balls small and almost all are uniform. Reasonably depth of field. Very nice and warm rendering.

[Jupiter 9 1\/100s f\/2](https://preview.redd.it/qkjucy2i18af1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2344ed2ef12868cf5314de4c7f28329743f6a70f)

Effectively, the same shot as the first phase.

[Panagor 1\/25 f\/4](https://preview.redd.it/sejjswyt18af1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee2584300e9e537dfc0a0c3e85d6e429bdfc949d)

A shot made in error (the aperture ring on the Panagor is VERY light and I closed it one click by mistake). Significant depth of field. Bokeh balls have lost their bubblish characters.

[Panagor 1\/40 f\/2.8](https://preview.redd.it/jy6cewpl28af1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c4d24ee29c6d4c8755ce801652b810dd0c47b06)

Still somewhat pronounced depth of field, a wee bit of a surprise. Noticeable vignetting. Bokeh balls are bubblish with visible overlap.

[TTartisan 1\/40 f\/2.8](https://preview.redd.it/pw5fceq138af1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2976f07fee827078cae1753542e06f69a0bf2ac)

The trioplan clone provides a very pronounced set of bubblish bokeh balls, with clear and multi-layer overlaps. Very pretty. Significant vignetting, much more pronounced and visible than the Panagor. Lower depth of field, too.

So - which one?

For size, convenience and ""correct"" directionality of controls, the Elmar is by far the best. On the other hand, it is the slowest lens and has somewhat annoying control quirks (my copy is from 1962, newer versions could be somewhat different). It also has the warmest colour rendering, something I like.

The Panagor is a monster. It is by far the largest, heaviest and least comfortable lens to use. Its insane focus throw (if memory serves, just over 900 degrees) is a pain in the neck. It does have the correct control directionality. Since it is a dedicated macro lens, one is unlikely to use it for portraiture. Or for bokeh...

The Jupiter is a somewhat annoying lens. It has lovely bokeh but so-so bokeh balls. And, it is slightly cold rendering. It is reasonably small. It is fast. But it has the wrong control directionality, something that annoys me. I would love to find something similar in character, but correctly oriented.

The TTartisan Trioplan clone is... well... Yeah. You want bubbles, that is what it is good for and only that. Want nice rendering, in a small package with less vignetting and, surprisingly, a similar price? Get an Elmar - it will be smaller, it will be warmer, it will be sexier and braggier (hey, a Leica lens).",1,1751358991.0,Leica,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,
Just wanted to share my experience getting acne scar treatments at GU Clinic in Gangnam in case anyone is looking for a place to treat their acne scars.

I’ve been dealing with acne scars for almost 12 years, and finding a place that treats them carefully was really important to me. At GU Clinic, all the staff were super respectful and kind, making me feel comfortable from the moment I walked in. The doctor was really patient, taking time to treat each scar one by one, which made me feel that they genuinely cared about improving my skin instead of rushing the session.

They also offer free drinks and coffee while you wait, and the place itself is pretty and clean, with a calm vibe that helped me not feel too nervous before treatment.

If anyone is looking for a clinic in Seoul to treat acne scars with careful, personalized attention, I’d recommend checking them out.

What happened two years ago today is still fresh on my mind. Seeing you again made me feel like it was just yesterday.  
  
July 1, 2023. It was a rainy day.

I remember, sabay tayong umalis ng hotel from our office workshop. Plan was to go stay at my place and meet my parents but then we decided to postpone and just have coffee. We stopped at SB and finished watching Killing Eve. We have been watching this series for quite some time, and we decided we will finish it together. Then hinatid kita pauwi sa inyo. I remember how our hands fit together sa buong byahe natin sa jeep. I remember kissing your hand.

I remember that pagbaba natin ng jeep, biglang bumuhos ang ulan. Sobrang lakas na walang nagawa ang bubong na pinagsilungan natin at nababasa pa rin tayo. Matagal tagal tayong nakasilong. I remember wishing that we may be stranded there for a long while. I remember looking at you and thinking, *I wanna be with this woman.* I remember you looking back at me, and let me kiss you. On that day, on that shed at A. Fernando St., under the rain, I remember how much I love you. It was as if you read my mind, you smiled and you said it back, *""I love you.""* But I also remember you walked it back and said it was just a slip of the tongue.

The rain stopped and you went home. That was the last time we kissed before you left our company. Had I known that was the last kiss we will share, I would've kissed you deeper. I would have said I love you more than you know. Had I known, I would gather all the courage and run away with you.

Yesterday, the day before that kiss' 2nd anniversary, we saw each other again. On that room full of people, I caught a glimpse of your face. I couldn't believe it at first. I was too scared to walk up to you, yet I found my self in front of you. You smiled at me like you did after that kiss. Yesterday, I was brave enough not to melt in front of you.

Now that I'm alone, I realized... I missed you.

Whatsupfamgoooooood morning, craziest morning ever like every other video. Jess gives us way too long of an explanation to tell us that Addie did a partner stunting class and she did great. It was an hour and what she did was impressive, Jess is proud, Addie wants to do more.

Their patio chairs came. She gives us way too long of an explanation to say she’s been buying back yard stuff. Her back hurts again and she didn’t even do anything. She called for backup? Presumably Chris, to put furniture together. Chris confirmed. 50 cuts of putting together chairs. They’re teal and white. Jess spends way too long telling us what chairs are for. 

Jess pretends to organically bring up her sponsor which is essentially psychiatry via telehealth. Dropping all their important buzzwords and phrases that don’t sound like how she talks and a milking jump cuts.

Chris is done with furniture and apparently some is yellow. She’s bewildered that people just buy new cushions for their patio furniture. Striped throw pillows on the loungers turned her back yard into an “oasis”.

We’re at Starbucks getting a Frappuccino and a pup cup. Chip has a scab on his belly. It’s a tick. There are two of them. She’s taking him to the vet. Honey had a grooming appointment too and her hair was getting matted. The groomer found the same scabs on honey. They just left the vet and they weren’t ticks. They’re skin infections and all they have to do is wash the dogs frequently. Go figure. Honey has the stupid pigtails again. Honey is not a cute dog imo. We have to watch her eat her pup cup. It’s Chip’s first. 3 min of awww so cute.

Ayla just had a bday party and Jess didn’t order presents til 2 days before and it didn’t come in time so they’re giving it to give it to her for her actual bday. She got sol de janeiro pink stuff. Charlotte tilbury makeup. A mirror. Lip balm. And pants with bows on the side I guess. When I was her age I still played with toys.

Next day and whatsupfamgoooood morning. They’re gonna do fun hair dye for summer. We know. It was already on Instagram. She got 4 kinds of dye. She talks forever about how good the arctic fox dye is. Jess is winging it. Addie is being bratty to Lilia who doesn’t really care. Jess can’t believe all the hair transformations. Addie wants to go to a professional and proclaims everything is about her. She wants cotton candy peekaboos. Jess thinks it’s hard, Addie says again she wants a professional. 

Jess talks a long time and says nothing. Lilia wants a red situation. Not sure what Jess is going for. There’s dye everywhere. Vaseline to keep dye off skin. Lilia looks a lot like Kyson with her hair slicked back. A couple shots of Addie not being funny because she’s trying. She’s actually pretty funny when she’s not trying like probably every kid, mine included.  Hair rinse montage. Hair dry montage. The color washed right out of Addie’s hair. They redid it. Rinsing Lilia. Chris makes a dumb joke. Lilia’s stayed. Addie’s stayed the second time. She loves it. The blue still looks bad like chlorine green.

That’s it. Jess hopes we had a famtastic day. I like it better when she talks less and montages more. It’s not more interesting, but at least I can skip through it and still give a full ish recap.

No clickbait, title is straight forward plus she already posted the hair content on Instagram and prob TikTok. Idk cause I don’t watch her TikTok. Or really even her Instagram unless she has a story up and it’s one of the first few when I get on.

Buy me a coffee for my hard work. Or else. Jk. I’m like a teddy bear. A big fluffy snarky teddy bear. Or something. https://ko-fi.com/psychologicaltime",1,1751358185.0,jesssfam_snark,0,1.0,False

I want to make sure I'm findable in case they have any questions, but I'm sure I don't need to be hanging around. I don't want to go into rooms further away in case they don't know where I am.

I think the murray commercials may be hinting at something. I know that I and a few other people noticed that most, if not all robots made by edwin had some form of the mimic program coded into it. The coat rack being able to adjust to any size of clothing, the mycellium men being able to repeat words and sentences it hears, and the stay up latte machine being able to observe the way you want your coffee and applies it to how it makes its own for you. Combine them all and you get the mimic. Or at least, one that can’t walk or terrorize you.

At the end of the true ending of the Secret of the Mimic, you enter this segment where you meet F10-N4, find out that the mimic has edwin trapped somewhere, and have this entire chase sequence with it. In that same chase sequence, you see that it’s not only the mimic itself chasing you, but many other of murray’s inventions do as well. Before this segment, however, you see that Fazbear Entertainment originally commissioned Murray’s Costume Manor to make the four main animatronics of the franchise: bonnie, freddy, chica, and foxy. 

My theory? The OG four has the mimic program somewhat embedded into their code and it’s possible that the animatronics aren’t even haunted. The animatronics might’ve just mimicked the missing children’s voices and mannerisms before they died and likely believe that they’re actually them. If that’s not the case and the animatronics really are haunted with the souls of dead children, I still stand by the fact that they have some form of the mimic program in there. This is more of a proposal than a theory since i’m not entirely sure if i’m correct and there are a lot a really large gaps to fill if it is true, but yeah.
