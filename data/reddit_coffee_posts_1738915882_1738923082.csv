Their entire premise is based on linking boba and burgers to K-pop and K-dramas, which is so poorly executed that the youth, who are increasingly aware of global food trends, will catch on sooner or later. This blatant cultural appropriation and misrepresentation has never let anyone expand beyond a certain point because it’s so gimmicky. Can’t believe this founder said he wants to go global—LOL. His version of K-pop food culture is as Korean as Britishers calling curry powder Indian. 

South Korea is known for its coffee culture, and while boba tea is popular across Asia, it’s not exclusive to Korea. Linking it to K-pop and K-dramas feels like a shallow attempt to ride the Hallyu wave.

Items like 'K-Pop Honey Sriracha Paneer Burger' are clearly Indian dishes with trendy buzzwords slapped on them. Sriracha isn’t even Korean—it’s Thai-American. And there’s no authentic Korean food like kimchi anywhere on their menu. What exactly is Korean about these burgers?

Their promotional images use Japanese architecture and cherry blossoms, showing a complete lack of understanding of Korean culture. It comes off as lazy and superficial appropriation.

Korean ice cream? Really?! Ice cream flavors like Thai Milk Tea (Thai), Matcha Milk Tea (Japanese), and Boxing Day (Thai) have zero connection to Korean food or K-pop culture.


This founder clearly knows how to build QSRs—so why not base it on authentic K-drama or Asian tea trends? The more people watch, the more they’ll discover authentic Korean food like gimbaps, bibimbaps, kimchi dishes, or Korean pancakes. Funny how a ""K-pop food brand"" has no kimchi on the menu! Globally, people are becoming more aware of authentic cuisines—just look at the rise of Korean noodles. Gimmicks like this are caught by the public immediately. Or why not just start a cool pan Asian brand. 

Gimmicky.

It would appear that all things tirz has become something of a special interest of mine, for the time being. I can’t seem to stop the rabbit holing. So, as I try to understand how this medicine works, notice how my body is responding,etc. I’m asking lots of questions and learning a lot. This morning, over morning coffee, I read this study https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(24)00186-4 (as one does over morning coffee). 

Now, as I’ve read posts on this sub about others’ experiences, I’ve noticed recurring topics: whether cico is key, whether low carb is necessary, dose splitting v once weekly dosing, etc. Sometimes my head spins trying to understand, truly, how this medicine actually works and what I can be doing to make sure I’m maximizing my use of it. Often, I can’t find any clear, definitive answers. However, this study seemed like it might offer a glimmer of clarity. Before I latch onto it as my life raft in a sea of conflicting anecdotes, I thought I’d ask people smarter than me (who are also inclined to wade through dense scientific jargon just for funzies) if I’m reading this correctly:

I think this says that, in addition to acting in concert with and boosting the work that insulin does during the fed state, tirzepatide increases the body’s ability to burn fat in the fasted state. Is that correct? If so, does that suggest that introducing some modest intermittent fasting might help maximize its effects? Up to now, I’ve been focused on counting calories and trying to stay in the sweet spot of adequate caloric deficit to sustain moderate weightloss without restricting so much that I lose too fast and have low energy. Typically that involves eating small meals at regular intervals throughout the day. But now, I’m wondering if I’d do better to adopt a more narrow eating window (8/16?) in order to prolong the fasted state during which tirz apparently shines (while still having enough time to actually consume enough calories).

Short version: before I started dating A I had a few very clear warnings not to date him from God. So I put my feelings away and decided just to be friends. But I ended up telling two of my other friends that I like A, and they set us up. Now I’m dating A, and God is still telling me to leave. Maybe I could have left in the beginning without hurting A too much, but at this point we’ve been dating for two months and I’ve told him I love him and I genuinely do!! He’s so sweet and genuine and respectful. But everything with God is harder now and I know I need to leave him. But what do I say? Everything’s been going so well it would be completely out of the blue and he’s gonna ask me why. (He is non religious). Thoughts and prayers appreciated <3

 Before I even stated dating A and we were friends, I felt like God was telling me no. I remember being interested in him but didn’t think he’d like me in that way but kinda dreaming about dating him. And I felt one of the most intense feelings of just no I’ve ever felt from God. I was confused by this because I had no plans of acting on my feelings. So from that feeling I decided to put my feelings away and just be friends with A. (Something I’m used to doing as I’ve never dated anyone because it just never seems to work out for whatever reason) later on one of my friends from church asked to meet for coffee with me and I felt that God really wanted me to go and listen. She told me a story of her first boyfriend and he was not religious and a lot of bad things happened and she got a really intense feeling that made her anxious from God telling her to leave him and she finally did and felt so much more free after that. She didn’t know anything about my situation. A is non religious. (But Idk if that’s why God wants me to not date him.) (Not that all people who are non religious are terrible partners, just something to be carful of cuz there can be such a big value difference) this was yet another clear warning from God. And so I had pretty much let all that go with A until I was riding in the car with two other friends and they started talking about how A was hot. And I was like “well I’ve actually had a bit of a crush on A for quite a while, but I’ve basically let that go” I gave the excuse that I didn’t think he liked me. They pulled into a parking lot on our university campus and texted A to come join us and I was like “what the heck are you doing??” And A came over and I left to use the bathroom, and my two friends very strongly hinted that I liked him (he basically got the picture) and I was like “well I’m half way there might as well” and I told him I liked him and to my surprise A liked me as well! And so we started dating! And ever since then I have felt very strongly that God wants me to leave him, but literally almost nothing has gone wrong. He’s so sweet and respectful and genuine. And I don’t want to just out of the blue say it’s not working out. In the beginning maybe that could have gone well without hurting him too much. But at this point we’ve been dating for two months and I’ve kissed him and told him I love him and I genuinely do!!!!! But when I’m caught in a sin like this everything else with God is so much harder. Harder to listen in church harder to read the Bible harder to look my Christian friends in the eye. What do I do? I love A and I know I’m beyond not hurting him but I still need to leave. But what do I say? I know he’s gonna ask me why. ",0,1738921938.0,Christianity,0,0.5,False

# First Impressions

When I first heard about the Nex Playground, I imagined it would be one of those gimmicky gadgets that ends up collecting dust next to my juicer and my ab roller. 

But then I saw the words Fruit Ninja and Whac-a-Mole, and I was instantly transported back to my college days, when I spent way too much time at arcades pretending I was good at games that required zero skill. The idea of playing those games in my living room, without having to explain to my kids why I’m terrible at them, was too tempting to resist.

Setting it up was surprisingly easy, which is a miracle considering my track record with technology. Within minutes, my living room was transformed into a chaotic mix of an arcade, a gym, and a dance floor. My kids were immediately hooked, and I was immediately out of breath.

# My Favorite Features

**No controllers.** It uses a built-in camera to track your movements, which means you don’t have to worry about losing tiny pieces of plastic under the couch. It’s like magic, except instead of pulling a rabbit out of a hat, you’re flailing your arms around like a maniac trying to hit virtual fruit.

**5 games to start.** The system comes with five pre-installed games, including Fruit Ninja and Whac-a-Mole. But if you’re like me and can’t resist the urge to unlock everything, there’s a Play Pass that gives you access to a whole catalog of games. It’s kinda like Netflix, but for games that make you sweat.

**Family-friendly.** The games are designed for kids and adults. The games are easy enough for kids to pick up but challenging enough to keep adults entertained. Plus, it’s a great way to bond with your kids without having to actually talk to them.

**Easy setup.** It connects to your TV with a simple HDMI cable, and the cube itself is small enough to fit in a backpack. It’s perfect for family game night, playdates, or those times when you need to distract your kids so you can finally finish that cup of coffee.

# Pros

* **Gets you moving.** getting the whole family moving is probably the biggest win here. instead of zoning out on separate screens, everyone’s laughing, sweating, and occasionally arguing over who got the highest score. it’s like family bonding, but with added cardio.

* **No ads etc.** The lack of ads and mature content makes it kid-friendly without being boring. plus, the subscription model unlocks a ton of popular franchises like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Peppa Pig. 

* **Versatile.** It’s versatile enough to appeal to different age groups and skill levels. And honestly, watching adults attempt to keep up with their kids is worth the price alone.

* **Portability is another huge plus.** unlike bulky consoles, this little cube fits anywhere. planning a road trip? throw it in the car. heading to a friend’s house? toss it in your bag. it’s like carrying a mini arcade wherever you go.

# Cons

Honestly, the main downside is the subscription cost. while the base system comes with five games, accessing the full catalog requires a sub. sure, it’s cheaper than a gym membership, but it still stings a bit.

Also the camera can sometimes get confused if multiple people are in frame. i’ve had moments where it mistakenly registered my husband cheering me on as part of the game, leading to some unintentional and hilarious failures.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re looking for a way to inject some fun into family time while sneaking in a workout, absolutely. it’s great for parents trying to pry their kids away from sedentary gaming or anyone who wants to relive their glory days of arcade madness.

But if you hate breaking a sweat or prefer traditional controller-based games, this might not be for you. same goes if you’re on a tight budget, the subscription fees are a bit of a pain if you want the extras. But overall, it’s a fantastic blend of entertainment and activity.

I’ve had this large monstera for about four years. It wasn’t in great shape when I got it but thrived for the first couple of years. I’m no plant expert, but I’ve always kept my plants healthy with basic care (watering and access to sunlight. Also repotting when they look like they’ve outgrown pots). I’ve had the smaller one for maybe 6 years. 

Since moving a year ago, both this monstera and a smaller one have been struggling. Last summer, I left them outside during the rain, but the sun came out unexpectedly and burned the leaves. Since then, smaller leaves have turned black—even ones that weren’t originally burned—and the plant hasn’t produced new growth. It also burns easily near the window, especially in summer.

There’s a window 3–4 meters to the right and another 2 meters to the left. Any advice and tips would be appreciated!

(First three pics show the big plant over a year with 6 month intervals - pic  2 taken post-burn. Pic 4 is a close-up of the blackened leaves. Pic 5 is the smaller monstera, and 6 is its current state.)

I’ve heard the concerns about my article and platform, and I want to address them head-on.

**Mentorship is my top priority.** I know firsthand how valuable mentorship can be—I’ve been both a mentor and a mentee, and through my role as **CPHR Campus Ambassador to NAIT**, I’ve built strong connections that have helped me grow.

The issue isn’t whether mentorship programs are beneficial—they are. The issue is that **not enough students know about or use them.** That’s a problem, and it’s one I plan to fix.

**Why does this matter?**

**Mentorship isn’t just about career growth—it’s about mental health too.** NAIT can be overwhelming, and having someone to guide and support you makes a huge difference. Strong mentorship programs help reduce stress, build confidence, and create a sense of belonging.

When I  attended NAIT for Culinary Arts in the late 00’s, I didn’t have a mentor. Looking back, having that support could have saved me a lot of mental distress and possibly changed a decision I later regretted. But what matters now is ensuring that future students don’t face the same struggles alone.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

Some disclaimers first.  
1: Please, please, please don't suggest diagnosis to me. I've been tested for everything and know exactly what I have.

2: Feel free to read my post history and draw whatever conclusions you want from it. I keep detailed logs of my health, sleep, and other factors and they tell me what they tell me.

3: I am not and have never been a danger to myself or others.

I was raised with munchausen syndrome by proxy. So naturally, in my teenage years I joined a cult. The cult attempted to beat the weirdness and sickness out of me. This, unsurprisingly didn't work. It just made me weirder and sicker.

They don't tell you this but teenage cults are fonts of mental illness. Of the 10 people I know well from those days, all developed serious mental illness, I was one of them. Six of the ten attempted suicide (with various degrees of seriousness), three of them were successful. I am not one of those six. I will not be one of those three. If I attempt suicide it means they win. They are not going to win. I am going to live a long and happy life and they can go fuck themselves.

By the time I went to college I was so damaged I was completely unable to interact with ordinary people. I would throw trantrums in public and follow people who were nice to me around. To me that was ""being friendly"". I had panic buttons at random stores pushed on me multiple times during my tantrums because they didn't have something I wanted or the clerk said something I didn't like. I'm told that sometimes I came off as an edgelord, sometimes it was harmless and silly, and sometimes genuinely threatening. Whatever. Not who I am now.

I got better. I got one parent the help they needed and cut the other one out of my life because they couldn't change. I went on medication for bipolar and DBT therapy for BPD. I got fired from every job I took, but each time it took longer and was for a different reason.

Little bit by little bit I'm building a personality I like. It's a long, difficult process. Even when I'm normal normal means different things. But when I get stressed I turn back into dipshit-mcgee. A warning sign is I always cross my legs. I don't know why. It means I'm about to become obnoxious, attention-seeking and self-sabatoge-y. I'm told some people find this version of me fun. Most don't. I don't. I hate it so much. I fucking hate it. I hate it so much.

A girl flirted at me at a coffee shop and it made me nervous so I told my best friend (who has the paitence of a priest for this sort of thing ) ""watch this"" and then went on a weird rant about Charles Dickens. It's like having a mask that doesn't fit stapled to my face. She ignored me from then on, which I guess is what that part of me wanted.

Today I was being productive late at night. Then a friend of a friend started talking to me. I don't like working because I have ADHD (because of course I fucking do) and it makes it difficult. She started talking to me and it made me anxious because I wanted to do my work but I didn't and I had to and I couldn't and

And I turned back into freak mode. I'll spare you the details. She'll never look at me the same again now. I'll always be a freak to her.

I hate this so fucking much. Being this person I'm not makes me want to cut my skin off. It makes me wish I could slice myself into a million pieces. It makes me wish I could be anyone else.

Thoughts:
1) Look and feel - beautiful and feels sturdy. Dishwasher safe too. 
2) Size - although it has a 400ml capacity, it's probably better for a 15g/240ml brew. I couldn't swirl the server with a 330ml brew - ended up stirring it. 
3) Swirlability - the more rectangular shape of the inner area that holds the coffee, means it's less suited to doing those satisfying swirls. 
4) Heat retention - much better at holding a higher temp than a single walled glass server. 
5) Got it direct from Varia who dispatched promptly from China. 

I brewed some El Diviso beans from Sweven into it - sublime coffee. Super citrusy with crisp kiwi and green apple notes. Delicious! Someone described it as a fruit bomb and I fully agree. ",1,1738919928.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Hi ladies. I don't feel comfortable confiding in anyone I know about this but I really needed to spill it somewhere. 

I've been with my husband for eight years. In the first year we were together he went on three solo trips to Morocco, I found it suspicious at the time but I put it down to my own insecurities from previous relationships. 

Three years after that trip I found out he was messaging a woman from over there on and off, it broke my heart because she sent me some of the messages and he had told her he loved her. I asked her if they had met before, she told me they hadn't. She said they had spoke about it but she hadn't been able to. I was so hurt but I gave him another chance, he claimed the only reason he had been still in communication with her on and off was because she owed him money and he wanted it back. 

Fast forward to 2023 I discovered emails which completely knocked me for six, in 2018 and 2021 he had emailed an adult worker asking if they were available. When I confronted him he  claimed that he didn't know why he did it but that he never went through with it, more of a on a whim then when reality hit he stopped himself going further. I was heavily pregnant at the time and just wanted it all to go away so yet again I moved past it, I had no evidence that he had. 

Since then I've been tormented with the past, my trust is skakey at best. Last week I discovered that he wasn't happy with the frequency we have sex after discovering he had told his friend how often we have it. 
That really hurt me, I'm quite a private person, I work hard and I do everything I can for my family with very little time or thought for myself. It shook everything up to the surface for me, Ive been quiet this past week thinking about it all but last night I asked him for the ""truth"". 

We sat down and he said he would be honest, that I deserves the truth and he would answer all my questions honestly. 

My first question was why was he in morroco?. 

He told me he had been trying to meet the woman I caught him talking to, everytime he went out there she was a no show. I asked him if he met anyone else out there, he told me he met a woman at the beach and took her out for food and a coffee. 

That has actually hurt me to my core, we didn't live together at the time but we had been together 10 months. He was very much a part of my family, spent time with my children and extended family and told me he loved me. 

I asked him about the adult workers, he still maintains he didn't see them but when pressed admitted to using them before we met. 

I don't want to shame anyone for using adult workers or being an adult worker but the truth is had I known that it would have changed my views of him from day one. 

I feel like last night was the first time of me truly meeting my husband. 
I didn't yell, I didn't get upset. I told him I'm glad he was honest after years of me asking him to tell me the truth. 

I told him I needed time for this all to sink in. 

Today I feel awful. 

Was I just never enough from day one?. 

He told me he's always loved me and it's not that at all but how would you feel if you were me?. I suppose that's why I'm here, how would you feel? because right now I just feel sad and not enough. ",1,1738919777.0,women,0,1.0,False

We’ve been together for three years now. She loves me, and I love her. No issues there.

Now comes my childhood friend—we’ll call her G. We’ve been good friends since childhood and became closer after 10th.

Recently, our school friends planned a trip to a waterpark. There were 5 boys and 7 girls, and G was one of them.

To get to the waterpark, we traveled by passenger train. Our seats weren’t together, so we got separated. There were two compartments—6 seats in each. In my compartment, there was a set of 2 seats at one end and 4 at the other.

I took one of the 2 seats and asked my friend (M) to sit next to me, but G said, “Nah, I’m sitting there.”

I said, “Okay,” and M was fine with it too.

She sat next to me and asked, “Do you have any movies on your phone?”

I said, “Yep.” Luckily, I had 500 Days of Summer downloaded, so we started watching it, sharing my earphones.

After some time, our friends called us to take photos. We followed them to the next compartment.

G said, “I’m feeling sleepy. I’m going back to our seat.”

I said, “Okay, I’ll come with you.” I thought I’d just give her company.

When we got back, she said, “I’m sleeping. Let’s watch the movie on the way back home.”

I said, “Okay.”

Then she hugged my arm and rested her head on my shoulder. I was shocked and uncomfortable, but I thought, “It’s not a big deal.” She’s a good friend, so I let it be.

She stayed like that for at least an hour.

When she woke up, we talked about random things and laughed a lot. After reaching the waterpark, she didn’t leave my side the entire time.

On the way back, our seats weren’t confirmed, so we stood for about 30 minutes before getting seats. They weren’t together, so I was sitting with another girl.

After some time, the girl checked her phone and said, “Ale me"". That means I’ll be back in a minute.”

I said, “Okay.”

She went to G, who was sitting nearby, and exchanged seats with her.

G came back and sat beside me again. I asked, “What happened to her?”

G said, “Nothing. She just wanted the window seat.”

I said, “Okay.”

Later, an earring seller entered our compartment. I said to G, “Can you help me buy an earring for my girlfriend?”

She said, “Okay.” She helped me choose a pair, then said, “Only for her?” with a smirk.

I said, “Help me pick one more,” and gave it to her. It wasn’t expensive, and I thought, “Why not?”

She was happy. I told her to put both pairs in her bag and give them to me when we got off the train. She said, “Okay.”

We reached our station, and I forgot to take the earrings from her.

I messaged her, and she said, “I’ll give them to you when we meet next time.”

Two days later, she messaged me, “You busy?”

I said, “Bol na.”

She said, “Up for a date tomorrow?” Then quickly added, “Jk, jk. You want the earrings back, right?”

I said, “Yep.”

She said, “Sharp 9 at Nerul station.”

I said, “Okay.”

When we met, she said, “I forgot the earrings at home. Sorry.”

I said, “It’s okay. Now what?”

She said, “I know a place if you’re not busy.”

I thought, “Alright, shit happens,” and agreed.

She took me to a cafe. We had coffee and something to eat.

After that, she said, “I want to sit somewhere. Do you have time?”

I said, “Yep.”

She said, “Let’s go to Jewels.”

We went to Jewels, a famous couple hangout spot in Nerul, and sat there for about an hour.

I said, “Let’s go home.”

She said, “Okay, but you want the earrings, right?”

I said, “Yes.”

She said, “Let’s go to my house. I’ll give you the earrings, and then you can go.”

She added, “There’s no one at home.”

I said, “Okay.”

When we reached her building, I said, “Bring the earrings here. I’ll wait.”

She said, “Why? Let’s go upstairs na?”

I said, “It’s getting late, and I have things to do. I can’t.”

She said, “Okay.”

After that, she brought the earrings down and gave them to me.

I don’t know why, but after all that interaction, I started ignoring her. She asked me to hang out at least 3–4 times after this incident, but I avoided her until today.

Yesterday, she messaged me saying she was bored and wanted to hang out. She asked if I was up for it.

I said, “Okay.”

We met at 9 today.

I didn’t realize today was Rose Day, and my girlfriend isn’t into all this Valentine’s Week stuff, so I didn’t think much of it.

“Let’s go to GC.”
(GC is a famous mall here.)

When we got there, she gave me a rose.

I said, “What’s this?”

She said “Don’t you know? Today is Rose Day. I don’t have anyone else to give a rose to, so I’m giving it to you.” (She smiled.)

I didn’t know what to say, so I just accepted the rose and smiled back. She looked happy and practically hugged me.

We continued walking, talked for about an hour, and then I told her, “I have to go.”

Now I’m home, and I can’t stop thinking about everything 
So the point is
Is she into me???
And on the other hand i like her to buy I also love my girlfriend 
And what if she confessed her feelings???? ",0,1738919614.0,relationship_advice,4,0.5,False

Surprised? Yes! You can purchase personalised jewellery for your brother or sister or for anyone. Customized jewelry pieces like necklaces, bracelets, or rings, or a special message will surely make the gift more memorable and exciting.

# Customized Gift Hampers

A personalized gift hamper is a selection of your sibling's favorite items, like chocolates, snacks, skincare products, fragrances, and more. Pack the item beautifully and add a personal touch by including a handwritten note or card to express your love.

# Favorite Sweets and Chocolates

Anyone will love to have a hamper of their favorite chocolates and sweets, whether it's a brother or sister. During Raksha Bandhan, you can elevate your rakhi gift with gourmet treats. You can opt for handcrafted chocolates, premium dry fruit assortments, or a pack of sweets like macarons or artisanal fudge.

# Smart Gadgets and Tech Accessories

This is another excellent idea to gift your sibling a smart gadget if they are tech-savvy. You can astonish them with a pair of wireless earbuds, a smartwatch, or a portable charger. If your sibling is more into gaming or photography, you can also choose gaming controllers, camera accessories, or even a quality power bank.

# Subscription Services

# Experience Gifts

It is another trend of gifting your sibling an experience by treating them with a spa day, a fine dining experience, a concert, or even a weekend getaway. An experience gift not only creates lasting memories but also strengthens your bond as you spend quality time together.

# Handcrafted Art and Decor

You can consider giving them a handcrafted item that can add a personal touch to their living space if your sibling is an art lover. Hand-painted pottery, a custom portrait, or a decorative piece that aligns with their taste can make for a thoughtful and unique gift.

1ijqwwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1ijqwwn/high_ratio_aeropress_brewing/,High ratio AeroPress brewing,"I switched from Nespresso to an AeroPress before Xmas and I've found a recipe which really works for me, but I'm a coffee noob and I wondered about some of the implications of the way I brew.

I do ~33g of coffee (ground on the finest setting of an Ode 1) then 100g of water at 92c stirred vigorously. So a 1:3 ratio which I'm led to believe is quite high. This produces a small volume of strong coffee to which I add 250ml of frothed oatmilk to create a cappuccino-adjacent drink.

Questions:
> The final drink should be fairly low in caffeine, right? So little of the volume is actually coffee and without the pressure of espresso I must be extracting less caffeine from the beans than in a typical shot

> Varying grind size and temperature doesn't seem to make much difference. Maybe I just have a bad palate but I wonder if at such a high ratio I'm sort of maxing out the potential extraction - i.e. there just isn't enough water to hold any more dissolved stuff so whatever variable I change I'm always getting the same level of extraction as the water quickly saturates?

* Going for a walk first thing in the morning
* Avoiding coffee (I don't drink at all)
* No screens two hours before bed
* Keeping a consistent sleep schedule (though I have about a 40-minute variation between days)
* If I can’t sleep, getting up for a bit before trying again

This approach worked well back then, but now the problem has returned. I did fall off the routine for a while, but I’ve been following it again, and the issues persist.

1ijqqhw,https://i.redd.it/e1updgxplohe1.jpeg,15 years of henna,"Just wanted to share my long term results as I've realised i have been doing this almost half my life. I've been hennaeing my hair for 16 years.

This is my hair. Naturally, I am dark brown with about 30-40% greys. I also dont brush it. I detangle it only in the shower with my fingers after applying conditioner. I henna the roots about every 3 weeks. It's a labour of love. That's for sure. I also don't go to the hairdresser, I cut my own ends when I can be bothered.

I have tried so many different brands over the years. The main takeaway I've learned is that after a certain price point, you're really just paying for the marketing and fancy boxes. I don't need to spend more than €7 a box. I only ever henna my roots,  and 100 grams is just enough to do my roots. I only use pure henna and lukewarm water. I find lemon juice a bit too drying. I've tried coffee grounds, various spices, and essential oils to try and tone down the smell, but I don't use any of those anymore because the smell doesn't bother me as much as it did when I was younger.
Currently the brand I use is Radico, just their pure organic henna. I live in Ireland.
 I've tried other brands like Khadi, Nupur, True Natural Goodness, and to be honest, most are great (I always check the ingredients to ensure I'm using pure henna) but there are always some brands or batches that are old, or poor quality, and you can tell right away when you open the packet and look at the powder (or once you finish applying it and look at your gloves and wonder why they didn't stain orange).

Happy to answer any questions you may have, although I have absolutely no experience with Indigo, only Henna, just so you peeps know :)

If you're interested in someone, just ask them out already. No need to play games or overthink it. If they're into you too, great! If not, move on and save yourself the stress. By the way, if you're looking for a mature partner, [check out](http://datingolderwomen.net) here.

Also, if you do decide to meet up, keep it casual and public—coffee shop, park, whatever. Public places just make things less awkward. And here’s a tip I learned the hard way: Always drive yourself. Don’t rely on someone to pick you up, and make sure someone close knows where you’re going, just in case.

Seriously though, I spent way too much time texting people instead of actually going on dates. Now, I just ask if I’m interested, and if it clicks, great. If not, I move on. Dating should be fun, not a waiting game.",2,1738918550.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

# First Impressions

ngl, when I first unboxed this thing, I had major ""this is either gonna be amazing or end up in the garage sale pile"" vibes. It looks like what would happen if a traditional overhead projector had a baby with an iPad - kinda techy, but not intimidatingly so.

The first thing that caught my attention was how compact it is. Like, you could actually store this somewhere without having to renovate your house or sell your spouse's golf clubs on eBay. It's about the size of a small laptop when folded up, which immediately earned it points.

Setting it up was genuinely easy, even for someone who still occasionally holds their phone upside down while trying to take a photo. The projector head pops up easily, and there's this satisfying click when it locks into place that makes you feel like you've actually accomplished something. So far, so good.

# My Favorite Features

**Bluetooth connectivity that actually works.** The app connects faster than my brain can come up with excuses for why i can't draw. plus, you can snap pics of literally anything and turn it into a traceable masterpiece. my kid spent an hour drawing our cat in various superhero poses, great fun.

**Step-by-step drawing guidance**. It breaks down complex drawings into simple steps, kind of like those cooking videos that make me think I can actually bake a wedding cake, except this actually delivers on its promises. each step is crystal clear, and there's no ""draw the rest of the owl"" moment where you're suddenly expected to transform basic shapes into the mona lisa.

**60+ pre-loaded images.** We're talking everything from dinosaurs to spaceships. The variety is actually impressive - there's enough content to keep kids busy through at least three loads of laundry. 

**Adjustable projection size.** you can make the images bigger or smaller by moving the projector up or down. 

**Battery or usb powered.** because nothing kills creativity faster than being tethered to a wall outlet. btw, get rechargeable batteries.

# Pros

* **Actually keeps kids engaged.** My record so far is 2.5 hours of uninterrupted creative time, during which i managed to finish an entire cup of coffee while it was still hot.

* **Builds legitimate confidence in art skills.** Watching my kid go from ""i can't draw anything"" to ""look at my perfect dragon!"" in like 20 minutes was pretty epic. they're now the designated artist for all family birthday cards, which has significantly reduced my hallmark budget.

* **Works on multiple surfaces.** We've traced designs onto everything from paper to cookies (pro tip: don't let your kid convince you to trace onto the walls. learn from my mistakes). it's especially great for crafting projects that would normally end in tears and wine (for the adults).

* **Surprisingly durable.** This thing has survived multiple drops, one juice spill, and what i can only describe as an interpretive dance involving a nerf gun. the build quality is way better than expected for something designed to be handled by tiny humans with questionable motor skills.

# Cons

* **Price tag.** It isn't pocket change, especially when you consider the potential add-on costs of extra cartridges and therapy sessions for when your kid's art suddenly becomes better than yours.

* **The projection could be brighter.** In direct sunlight, it's about as visible as my motivation to do laundry. you'll want to use it in slightly dimmer conditions for best results.

# Final Thoughts

If you're looking for a legit way to help your child develop artistic skills while maintaining your sanity, the smART Sketcher 2.0 is pretty much it.

It's perfect for:

* Kids who love art but get frustrated easily
* Parents who want educational screen time alternatives
* Anyone who's ever tried to draw a horse and ended up with what looks like a drunk moose
* People who appreciate the sweet spot between technology and traditional art

A couple of months ago I was looking into whitening kit products that actually work but don't cost an arm and a leg. Because I really struggle with my teeth discoloration (I drink like 8 cups of coffee a day) So I've tried a lot of different brands, some were cheap but did't do much, and others worked well but were kinda pricey.

In the end, I found one that I think is pretty good for the price and gets the job done. So I thought I'd share it with you guys, in case anyone's looking for something to help with whitening. Also i'll give you some information down here below about each. Hopefully what I've found can help you out a bit! ❤️️

1 - [Auraglow Teeth Whitening Kit](https://amzndp.com/B00YI5VJW6) – **Best Overall**

This is the best overall whitening kit I have tried because there is ZERO pain. So if you have overly sensitive teeth like me, this is the one you want. Plus the results were the best.. my teeth got 6 shades whiter within a month. Absolutely incredible!

2 - [SNOW Diamond Teeth Whitening Kit](https://amzndp.com/B0D3J8TSC3) – **Highest Quality**

If you want something cheaper but still is ok for sensitive teeth, Burst is a very good option. It whitened my teeth a few shades over the course of a few weeks and I felt almost no pain at all.

4 - [MySmile Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit](https://amzndp.com/B0CD9L6R7L) – **Best Concentrate Option**

If you do not want to do the UV light, get MySmile concentrate kit. This is really effective and for me, I could feel it working almost instantly. Highly recommend.

5 - [Venus Visage Teeth Whitening Kit](https://amzndp.com/B0DFWTP7PG) – **Best budget teeth whitening kit**

If you want something cheap but still works good, try Venus. Most of the other kits in this price range are just absolute crap, but this one actually works albeit not quite as well as the others. But at the price, it's a great value.

  
Well, that's it! I hope this helped all you all who are looking for whitening kit products. So please do let me know if you have any questions! 🦷 ❤️

I was 26, broke and depressed. I had no real social circle except one good friend, my coworkers at a construction company. At this point I was lonely and addicted to porn, didn't have purpose and only started going to the gym twice a week.

I went to the grocery store after work and some girl was jumping in an isle to get a box of cereal from the top shelf. She was 5'3"" or smaller, I'm 6'1 so I asked her which one she wants. I grab it for her, she goes red in the face and says "" thank you so much "". For some reason I decided to talk to her and we ended up talking for at least 20 minutes. I mostly listened since my life is boring and mandane. At the end I really felt the need to ask if I could see her again in a different setting? She replied "" sure, text me if you like "". I said good bye, shook her hand, said "" lovely meeting you this way "".

I was desperate for a date back then so I watched it vids  on how to text so I "" played it cool "" a d waited 3 days before sending her a message if she wanted to meet for a coffee or a popsicle ( idk why but I said that ).

She accepted and on Sunday we meet in a public place. She half hugs me, looks happy. We go for a 2 hour walk, get a coffee and another hot chocolate. I mostly listen once again. Then at the end I said "" I didn't mean to starve you, let's get something to eat "". We go to this bistro sandwich shop and sit down. Prob 15 mins in, I just fart in a loud and unexpected way ( I didn't mean to obv ). She drops her sandwich and completely lost her appetite. 10 mins later we say goodbye but you can see all her joy was gone
 
I was so embarrassed that I didn't know what to send after. I apologised and asked if she got home safely but she never replied. I felt suicidal and hopeless. Luckily after a week or so I got over it but that shit was so heartbreaking because she seemed so sweet and lovely.

1ijqfv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ijqfv7/old_friend_40f_going_through_a_rough_time_made_an/,Old friend (40F) going through a rough time made an unexpected move on me - now I don’t know how to respond to her apology.,"Okay, so there's this woman (40F) whom I've known since childhood—we went to school together and even dated for a few months back then.

After school, we lost contact but reconnected last year through Facebook. We met up for coffee to catch up, and she told me about the incredibly tough things she’s been through: an abusive father, a son struggling with severe drug addiction, losing her job, financial struggles, and even damaging her car. I felt really bad for her, so I met with her a few more times to support her.

Throughout all of our meet-ups, there was never anything romantic or sexual—no hints, no tension, nothing like that.

The last time we spoke was in September, when I saw online that she was looking for a new place to live (again). I asked if everything was okay, and she just replied, *""Because my life is shit.""* I offered to meet up if she needed someone to talk to, but it never happened due to conflicting schedules.

Then, out of the blue, she contacted me yesterday, asking if my offer still stood. I agreed to meet her after work, expecting another conversation about her struggles. But things were… weird.

She claimed to be in a *""good place,""* but it was obvious she was under the influence of *something.* I don’t know if it was alcohol or drugs, but her eyes had that unfocused, intoxicated look, her speech was slurred, and she was acting strangely—giving vague or odd answers to basic questions.

When we went outside for a smoke, I asked her directly if she was okay and if she was on anything. She denied it and said everything was fine—but it clearly wasn’t.

Then, when we went back inside, she suddenly grabbed my hand and said, *""Let's go to bed.""* At first, I didn’t even process what she meant, but then she turned around and tried to kiss me.

I immediately stopped her and reminded her (again) that I have a girlfriend. She started apologizing over and over. I reassured her that it was fine and tried to lighten the mood, but it didn’t work. She became aggressive, so I left.

A few hours later, she texted me simply: *""I’m sorry.""*

And now I’m stuck. I haven’t opened the message yet because I don’t know how to respond.

Part of me wants to ask if she’s sober now and can actually explain what happened. But at the same time, I feel like doing that would just create more unnecessary drama. I’m at a point in my life where I want to be around stable, positive people—but I also feel really sorry for her. It’s clear that something is *not* right, and I tend to have a bit of a ""helper syndrome.""",1,1738917224.0,Advice,13,1.0,False

You can decide lol. BUT the reason I'm a bit annoyed is that I was just told that I was being given a drink with less espresso in it for over a year and no one told me about it, despite my asking several times to make sure it was cool to order the drink how I did. I don't have a lot of money, I don't do Starbucks as often as I'd like. But I try to do points earning things so I can get 1 really expensive drink with stars every once in a while. I then take the really expensive drink and drink only a bit of it at a time, while adding some of the 1/2 gallon espresso from the grocery store to make it last longer. When I get 200 stars, I use the app to order my drink and the most espresso shots it'll let me add is 12. Before I did this, I went into the store and asked if getting a shaken espresso with 12 shots would even work, was there enough room in the cup, tell me if I'm OK doing this, etc. I was told, since about 1.5 years ago when I moved here, that it would be totally fine. Same Starbucks every time. Light/no ice to make room, told them it's cool to put less milk and everything. I really just want the espresso to make my other drink concoction at home for a few days. 1.5 years of this and the last time I went a manager comes out and told me I've not been getting the drink I ordered the entire time, that there isn't enough room in the cup and that they have just been throwing out the espresso that doesn't fit in the cup. Again, I know it's a crazy drink order, which is why I had so many conversations to make sure it was OK to order and was told so many times, by multiple baristas (but I did have 1 girl most of the time) and was never told I was essentially wasting coffee. I would have stopped, I would have asked what they suggested, I would have literally done anything else but keep ordering the same drink. So I'm annoyed no one told me before 😩 why?!??? Anyway, now I know. But I also wonder if they never told me because my drink was annoying to make. I would always tell them I'm fine waiting, take other people before me because I know it's gonna take time to pull 12 shots. I really was trying to be as considerate as possible because I felt guilty being an annoying customer. But I still feel like they should have told me. Am I delusional?

1ijqeqb,https://i.redd.it/czpe8mj9hohe1.jpeg,Can we experience a contentment of joy?,"Why can’t we live in a world where if someone feels a spark of joy why can’t they just go with it?

 - I wish people felt confident enough to let their joy be known to themselves, or others, just at least something. Any amount of joy or happiness is meant to be celebrated I believe..it can be so hard to experience joy though many things around you could bring you joy. The world around us tells us that we must do things that bring us joy, but sometimes we can do anything that we love but it may not necessarily bring us happiness. Are we supposed to be fully happy people? Why do we question if we are a ‘happy person’ or not? We are all mere humans with things that can spark joy, but that doesn’t mean it’s promised. To me, joy is something that is long awaited and slowly anticipated for. With my partner I find joy in sitting beside them reading or with my friends doing usually the same thing we always do, coffee or thrift shopping. This doesn’t mean that I’m ecstatic every time we do these things but I enjoy the simplicity of something that is different every time and I believe I find a contentment of joy from it. Though we may do things that are considered the same every time, no time is always the same. I hope people know even if it is a tiny sliver of happiness, let yourself feel those feelings. You don’t need to run a race, but let yourself be open to experience joy.

Many times esp when workload is heavy, I had the temptations to give in to chocolates or small slice of cakes. I'd tell myself, I've worked hard why not give myself some leeway 

But I counter that with no no no and no. I keep to my CICO. In fact, I managed to cut down my coffee intake. When I started my CICO, I make it a point to drink 2 glass of water for every shot of coffee I take. I used to take 4 double espresso a day (there's too much blood in my coffee system). Now I've managed to cut down to only 1 double espresso per day while keeping my water intake to 1.5L to 2.0L.

There's a company in my area whom I've dealt with two of their male recruiters and I'm beginning to see they have culture problem. I know I'm a person who people feel easy to chat with and even in a professional setting, I can get people to feel at ease and safe with me.

Back a few years ago I was looking for a role and now as well due to lay offs.

Please share how you'd deal with this mentally as it feels like harassment and I'm dreading interacting with them.
Male 1
- young guy, looks like he thinks the world of himself and tries to be smooth. After I receive an offer elsewhere and told him he asked me for coffee about every few months for a year and also emailed and called me. I only picked up once and the message was the same. He said he would like to know what my work entails in the new job and how we can collaborate together in the future as he's in for a promotion and would like some industry knowledge
My response : blocking on calls and emails and maybe even LI.. so far no contact... A good result 

Male 2
- just started as a recruiter after working as a research manager in industry
- is an acquaintance of a colleague and I got his contact via her WhatsApp
- I contacted him on LI after he accepted connection and we had a video call on LI. Wasn't inappropriate and since the job had a tight timeline he was very good about setting expectations 
- a few days later he whstsapped me asking for birthday information (minus year) for the application and some other info which was ALREADY ON EMAIL. Because of the tight timeline I replied on WhatsApp. Then he had other questions and would get terms wrong which felt like a text chain because I'm correcting him. I did not enjoy that.
Other weird stuff : asking me to get a reference from THAT company, asking me to go ""unofficial"" routes to find more info about subject matter on that role because he cannot provide, TELLING ME HE WANTS TO KNOW ALL THE OTHER INTERVIEWS I GOT AND IF IM ADVANCING so he can put pressure on his client (this feels too intimate and uncomfortable)
- not being sure who the hiring manager is but gives me a name and when I said I contacted them he said don't contact the hiring manager (which when asl he is still not sure who to it is : ""I think it's him"")
- got a call when I got an interview from his client on WhatsApp. Productive call but do not enjoy using social media for this. I tolerated due to the tight timelines
- the next time he texted again I said I'll email you the answer and let's take the conversation there. Then the next time he had a different question he texted me on WhatsApp. So nauseating 
- when I got a second interview he asked who it was with which is so weird... It's like I'm an insatiable thirst and he wants to have contact with me everyday now leading up to my inzerviews. And why wouldn't he know who his clients are ??
- told me the company offers coaching before the interview and since male 1 also did that and it wasn't valuable I said no and male 2 started to strongly suggest it saying it's how they do business and their client wants this. I spoke to two older colleagues of mine who suggested to play nice and do the coaching to show I can follow rules. It feels like he IS STRONG ARMING me onto this because he sent the invite in a time I was ok with and CC his manager (another dude) to ""add value"" even though we agreed we could cancel this meeting five minutes in if I didn't see any value. Feels like STRONG ARMING when he said if I didn't do it they will have to tell their client that I refused coaching. I have a problem with MEDIOCRE men coaching me !!


I am sick of male 2's constant want for contact and questions which make him look incompetent and creepy. I mentioned male 2 about male 1 in a way of that I don't want to change recruiters and want to stick with male 2 but now I feel like I want to fail at the interview to not deal with any of them. Recruiters are parasites anyway but these ones seem creepy to me and it may be company culture. I feel stressed and lose sleep over the potential of having contact with them. And I actually need to feel fresh and ready for the interviews.

I'm a 30 year old female and need some advice.I've had extreme acid reflux/gerd since high school. I've tried every OTC PPI, protonix, Reglan prn, every H2, tums prn, carafate, maalox prn. Current meds I'm on are Zoloft 250 mg daily for OCD (been on it for 10 years), slynd (progesterone only birth control) and 60 mg famotidine TID (sometimes more if needed). I have a small Hiatal hernia seen on imaging and EGD. I've had a biopsy negative for celiac, and my EGD showed gastritis and espospagus irritation but nothing crazy. Of note my grandfather also has acid reflux issues and ended up with Barrett's esophagus. I'm a little overweight but working on it but this problem has been happening since I was 15 and underweight and then normal weight as well so it doesn't seem to be weight dependent. I ended up with kidney stones from too many tums (I used to have to take a whole bottle of 60-100 a day)so now I limit them. I eat an extremely bland diet, my mattress is at an angle, I have special pillows and I don't drink alcohol/coffee or anything that could contribute to the reflux. I constantly wake up with a cough from it and burning throat. My GI has suggested a Nissen Fundoplication because they suspect I have a really crappy LES and it would fix the hiatal hernia. I don't know much about this surgery though and it freaks me out a little to be honest. I can't live like this anymore though. Have you had patients that have been successful with this surgery? My GI said they have and I've read some great patient results but I just wanted to throw it out here too. The complications of it possibly coming undone and then needing another surgery make me apprehensive but also who knows what taking massive doses of Pepcid daily are doing to me. I guess both have risks. I've had a second opinion and they also agreed the Nissen would be the next step. What are your experiences with patients who have had it? Thank you!

I woke up this morning a bit behind, needing to prepare for school. I had to go into the living room to make myself some coffee, where the rest of my family were waiting.

Because it was piping hot and I was in a rush, I began to slurp the coffee so I could drink it faster. This upset my sister, who has narcolepsy and possibly is sensitive to loud sounds. She audibly asked me “Can you stop?” so I tried, drinking the coffee without slurping and at a lower volume. This still upset her, causing her to bang the table in annoyance. Now I lost it (not only was she still annoyed, but we were upset with each other with an argument a day prior) so I yelled “What else do you want? Me to pour the piping hot coffee down my throat?”

Enter my dad, who told my sister the way she responded was wrong, but also me for yelling at her. He claimed I didn’t care about others, and unlike regular people in the British country, I lived in my own world. This deeply annoyed me, because aside from this I always tried to be wary of others, holding open the door and being extra careful on the street so didn’t bump into anyone. Clearly he didn’t know me. 

I laughed a bit, pointing out what bullshit his statement was. I responded with “I’m the most caring motherfucker on the planet” (admittedly not the best choice of words.)

He responded with “maybe this is why you don’t have any friends.” This provoked a reaction from the rest of the family, even the sister I had been arguing with, saying it had gone too far.

I got in the car to drive to the bus station. Dad admitted I had been wrong but didn’t like how I yelled at her. He said I only cared about the “cyberworld” and not the feelings of others. I tried to defend myself: it’s the morning, I don’t usually act like this, and I was just in a bad mood. He dismissed it as excuses, saying “You wouldn’t kill someone in the morning” to which I responded by saying that is a disproportionate comparison.

My sister texted me to say I forgot my flask (I didn’t, it was packed in my bag.) I decided to respond and as soon as I did so, he accused me of texting my mom so I could cry to her, so she could take my side, tell me I’m right. I was at this point furious with him and his assumptions, showing him the screen and explaining the situation. His final remark? “You need to grow up.”

The comment he made about talking with my mother behind her back is completely hypocritical as I recall an incident where I was instructed to retrieve a glass from a cupboard. He didn’t specify which one but thought it was “obvious.” I will never forget the remark he made as I scrounged through the cupboards, looking for the glass:

“Your brother isn’t very bright, is he?”

I know the irony of me proving his point by posting it here, but I need a neutral perspective, as dad would say mom would just “enable” me. So guys, AITA?",1,1738916073.0,AmItheAsshole,6,1.0,False
1ijq5up,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1ijq5up/i_hate_to_sound_like_a_boomer_but/,I hate to sound like a boomer but…,"It frustrates me that a lot of my peers (friends included) make horrible financial decisions. I agree that we’re in a worse economic situation than our parents and grandparents were at our age. I’m not one of those “your $5 coffee is the reason you can’t afford a house” people. HOWEVER, I see a lot of my peers go on extravagant vacations (resorts, excursions, new outfits purchased specifically for the vacation) while they can barely pay their rent. Or insisting that they NEED to have a $300+ night out for every birthday. Not even including the hair, nails, lashes, and outfit they get for said birthday all while asking people to borrow money a few days later. 

And the constant eating out is crazy to me. If one more person who doordashes chipotle and Wingstop daily complains to me that they’re broke…. Some of my coworkers act bewildered by the concept of bringing your lunch to work or making a coffee at home. Not an exaggeration. They will openly talk about how they’re using the last $20 in their account on McDonald’s. 

I’m all for treating yourself and believe that everyone should still be able to enjoy restaurants, trips, new clothes etc regardless of tax bracket, but it gets to a point. It’s not only our generation and maybe it’s a general young person thing, but I feel like it’s way more rampant with us because of things Amazon and food delivery apps.

1ijq5na,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijq5na,The Star Rewards isn't fair,"

I absolutely hate this Starbucks app now, I have been a loyal member for more than 10 years, just to see 82.61% of my ""Stars"" rewards GONE!!!!!

From 241.4 Stars to 42 current....

All because of the new expiration Stars reward policy, if you don't use your Stars with 6 months, you'll lose them. 

Great example that happened to me.

In 1 month, I spent $143.50 in coffee, which is 143.50 Stars equivalent.

Since it passed the 6-month calendar date, I lost all those rewards in one swoop......


☕️ SUMMARY ☕️

Beware of your Stars and how much your spending in a single month, I advise keeping track of your monthly Stars and set a calendar date alarm before the expiration.

So you can use all your Stars to your full advantage ☕️📚",0,1738915930.0,starbucks,2,0.4,False
