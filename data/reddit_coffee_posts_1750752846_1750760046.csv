Three years later, he regained his sight and ended their marriage. “We’ve already lost so many years. I won’t let her waste another one on me........","**Chapter 1**

The night before their third wedding anniversary, Cary Gibson emerged victorious from a high-end auction, securing a pair of rare sapphire earrings. He said softly, “This is for the person I owe the most-my beloved.” From home, his wife, Evelina Marsh, felt tears pooling as she watched the auction on television. Tomorrow was their third anniversary, and maybe, at long last, Cary had realized her devotion. Cary’s grandmother, Demi Gibson, exhaled in quiet satisfaction. “At long last, Cary’s learned how valuable his wife truly is. The next evening, Evelina had barely set the finishing touches on an extravagant dinner when Cary stepped through the door. She hurried to greet him, swiftly taking his briefcase before reaching out for his coat. Quite a feast tonight,” he said lightly. “Did something happen? Tall and captivating, Cary carried himself effortlessly. Even the simple act of loosening his tie appeared like a polished gesture from a high-fashion shoot. Yet, somehow, he always managed to chill Evelina with just a few words. Her fingers paused uncertainly, and she quietly said, “You didn’t forget, did you? No, that couldn’t be right. He had purchased those priceless sapphire earrings to make amends, hadn’t he? Cary’s eyebrows knitted together slightly. “Forget what exactly, Evelina? The sapphire earrings… you bought them, didn’t you?” Her heart trembled with unease, but hope stubbornly remained. How do you know about those earrings?” Cary appeared genuinely startled. He clearly didn’t expect his mild-mannered, invisible wife to keep tabs on such extravagant things. A faint smirk tugged at his lips, hinting at contempt. Certainly, Evelina possessed natural beauty-gentle features, eyes soft and expressive-but she refused to flaunt it. She dressed plainly, appearing perpetually dull and overlooked, like a flower that had ceased to bloom. Even the Gibson household maid seemed more refined than Evelina. Yet, Evelina gathered her courage, eyes shining cautiously. “I saw the auction broadcast. Those earrings are really lovely-“Cary interjected her abruptly, “They’re for Esme. At the mere mention of his first love, Esme Barton, Cary’s voice softened noticeably. “She’s finally agreed to return to me. Naturally, I needed something special to welcome her back.”

Evelina felt her chest tighten painfully, her breath hitching.

So, the one he felt indebted to was Esme Barton, the very woman who had abandoned him?

And what did that make her-the devoted wife who had stood beside him for three years without complaint, never even asking for recognition?

Unable to bear it, Evelina’s voice wavered with hurt. “Cary, have you forgotten whose fault the accident was-the one that blinded you?”

On that terrible day, Esme had thrown a tantrum over something insignificant, distracting Cary and causing him to crash.

When news broke that Cary’s sight was likely permanently lost, Esme swiftly disappeared, crafting a flimsy excuse before fleeing overseas the same day. She left no trace, vanishing completely.

Their wedding had already been announced, invitations sent. Neither Esme nor her family could be located.

If Evelina hadn’t courageously stepped in at the final hour, the Gibson family would’ve been the scandalous gossip of the whole city.

“You know nothing about it!” Cary retorted harshly. “Esme wasn’t to blame!”

He refused to tolerate any criticism directed at his so-called true love. “Esme arranged the surgeries for my eyes,” he replied defensively.

“If someone hadn’t accidentally revealed the truth, I would never have known everything she secretly did for me.”

Stunned, Evelina could barely form words. “What… are you saying? It was Evelina herself who performed his surgeries. His grandmother had practically begged her for help.

She had conducted three critical procedures, pushing herself to exhaustion.

Countless sleepless nights she spent tending to him, never revealing she was the renowned Sight Weaver, devoting herself entirely to Cary.

How had Esme ended up with all the credit?

“Are you certain? You trust every rumor you hear?”

“Absolutely. Esme was Professor Landen Mitchell’s last apprentice-the only person on Earth qualified to perform those surgeries,” Cary responded with unwavering pride and gratitude.

But wasn’t Evelina actually Professor Mitchell’s final apprentice? How long had Esme been pretending to be her?

Evelina desperately wanted to expose Esme’s deception right then and there, but she quickly recalled her mentor’s death six months earlier.

Of course, Esme would choose now to make her return.

With Landen gone, no one could challenge Esme’s claims.

And Cary, fully healed through Evelina’s care, now held significant influence as head of the Gibson Group. Esme’s timing was impeccably strategic.

Evelina had no evidence, no way to reveal the truth. Quietly, bitterly, she asked, “Then what are you even doing here tonight? Shouldn’t you be celebrating with Esme?”

Removing her apron abruptly, Evelina felt despair gnawing painfully at her heart.

Cary’s answer was casual and indifferent. “I’m exhausted, Evelina. Let’s end this marriage. We agreed on three years, and I’ve endured it long enough.”

Endured it long enough? How dare he casually dismiss all her sacrifices?

Three long years she’d sacrificed, pouring everything she had into nursing him back from blindness, making him the powerful man he had become.

Without even acknowledging the anguish on her face, Cary calmly took out a set of divorce documents, obviously prepared ahead of time.

“Review them. If you have no objections, sign. I’ve wasted enough time already. I won’t make Esme wait anymore.”

Glancing over the papers, Evelina focused bitterly on the divorce settlement-an apartment far from the city center, the worn-out car she’d driven for groceries, and a mere three million dollars.

Incredible. His audacity was astonishing.

He’d gifted sapphire earrings worth three hundred million to the woman responsible for his blindness, yet offered a paltry three million to the wife who had saved him. Three million wouldn’t even cover the cost of one of her surgeries, let alone make up for the countless procedures she had rejected during these three years spent hidden away, caring only for him.

“If you want more…” Cary anticipated tears or pleading from Evelina.

Instead, she scoffed softly, picked up the pen decisively, and signed her name with determination.

Cary faltered, bewildered. He hadn’t expected her to surrender so quickly. Evelina was an orphan-would she really walk away from a life of comfort?

Handing back the signed papers, Evelina said coldly and clearly, “It’s done. But Cary, you’d better not regret your choice. 

**Chapter 2** 

Momentarily startled, Cary recovered quickly. “Of course I won’t regret this. But since you accepted the settlement, it’s your responsibility to explain the divorce to Grandma. Cary knew perfectly well that Demi only recognized Evelina as her true granddaughter-in-law. If news of their divorce reached her ears, he’d face her wrath. And naturally, Cary expected Evelina to shoulder the blame. Without raising her gaze, Evelina calmly replied, “I’m not explaining anything to her. In these past three years, I’ve settled my debt with Demi in full. Aren’t you madly in love with Esme? What’s wrong-can’t even muster enough courage to face your own grandmother? Growing up in an orphanage, Evelina owed her education entirely to Demi’s generosity.

So when the Gibson family urgently needed a substitute bride, she’d readily stepped in.

She didn’t flinch when Cary lost his vision. Instead, she fulfilled her duties faithfully, cared tirelessly for him, and managed the household without complaint.

She had one modest request-a three-year trial. If Cary failed to fall in love with her by the end, they’d peacefully part ways.

Now, finally, her freedom had arrived.

“True love conquers everything,” Evelina replied dryly, sarcasm lightly coating her words. “I genuinely hope your perfect fairytale lasts forever.”

Reaching for her car keys, she found her path abruptly blocked by Margot Gibson, Cary’s younger sister.

“Evelina, I heard you’re divorcing my brother. That car is Gibson family property-you can’t take it!”

Evelina laughed coldly. “I paid for this car myself. Honestly, Margot, you’re just as brazen as Cary.”

Drawn by the commotion, Cary stepped forward. “What’s happening here?”

Immediately, Margot complained petulantly, saying, “Cary, Evelina is taking the car, and I was planning to use it!”

His brow creased slightly. “Evelina, hand over the keys to Margot.”

“Absolutely not,” she replied coldly. “Why should I?”

“You’re unbelievable!” Margot lunged forward to grab the keys. Suddenly, an old suitcase flew into the vehicle, followed swiftly by several lit firecrackers.

In moments, sparks flew and thick smoke billowed as the firecrackers erupted, sending Margot shrieking in panic.

“The car is yours-I don’t want it,” Evelina responded coolly, brushing off her hands as she turned decisively away.

Everything she’d used or worn in the Gibson household would remain. She wanted nothing to remind her of this place.

She quickly dialed her closest friend, Kristina Anderson.

As Evelina reached the villa gates, a sleek, understated luxury car awaited her.

Kristina’s jaw dropped dramatically. “Well, if it isn’t the real Queen Evelina herself.

Feigning astonishment, Kristina rubbed her eyes. “Three years, Evelina. Every call I’ve made, you were too preoccupied tending to that ungrateful husband. I honestly couldn’t tell whether I’d attended your wedding or your funeral back then.”

Leaping forward, Kristina embraced Evelina tightly. “Finally done with that ‘blind’ fool? Good. Now we start living for real.”

Kristina snapped her fingers theatrically. “Wait, no-I need to stock up on fireworks! Your grand return demands a proper celebration.”

“You’re too late,” Evelina said coolly, gesturing casually over her shoulder.

Just then, an explosive bang split the peaceful night. The old car erupted spectacularly into flames.

Sparks scattered brilliantly, lighting up the darkness in a vivid display.

“How’s that for a farewell gift?” Evelina asked with a playful grin, her eyebrow arched mischievously.

Kristina erupted into laughter. “There she is! Queen Evelina is finally back! Time to party!”

Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelina gave an exhausted sigh. “Another day, perhaps. I just desperately need sleep.”

She had spent the last three years caring tirelessly for Cary’s recovery, barely managing to rest properly. Fatigue weighed heavily on her now.

Inside the villa, Margot was stamping her foot furiously.

“She nearly scared me to death! Has Evelina lost her mind? She destroyed our car! Cary, you have to do something about her-”

“That’s enough!” Cary interrupted sharply.

Exasperation lined his voice as he scolded, “Is this childish tantrum how a Gibson should behave?

Margot quickly shifted to a pleading, wounded tone, saying, “Are you actually scolding me over that woman? Wait until I tell Esme-she’ll see how much you’ve changed!”

“Don’t talk nonsense,” Cary retorted irritably, though privately dismissing Evelina as insignificant compared to his sister.

He quickly softened his voice to reassure her. “Have you forgotten Jasper Russell is arriving in Aglonard soon?”

The Russell family, among Ireah’s most influential families, dominated politics, business, and military circles, making them untouchably powerful.

And Jasper Russell, their youngest heir, wasn’t only extraordinarily charismatic but also managed the immense Russell Group. His slightest gesture sent ripples across high society.

Most importantly, he was the only bachelor among the Russell heirs. Every wealthy young woman in Aglonard and beyond fantasized about becoming Mrs. Russell.“I haven’t forgotten,” Margot murmured shyly, blushing deeply at the mention of her admired figure.

She clung affectionately to Cary’s arm, adding eagerly, “He’s visiting for his niece’s eye treatment. If Esme successfully heals Miss Florrie Russell’s eyesight, she’ll become indispensable to the Russell family-and undeniably valuable to us. Even Grandma will have to accept her then.”

Cary gave a thoughtful nod.

“And if you assist Esme during the operation and gain Miss Russell’s favor… perhaps Jasper himself will notice you,” he suggested encouragingly. “Oh, thank you, Cary!” Margot’s eyes sparkled as dreams filled her head.

But Cary’s thoughts wandered unexpectedly. The image of Evelina striding confidently away, fearless and poised, lingered stubbornly.

He had dismissed her as plain, passive, even boring. This daring, fierce version of her was entirely unexpected. Perhaps… he needed to reassess the woman he’d overlooked for three years.

**Chapter 3**

Evelina spent three uninterrupted days catching up on sleep in Kristina’s luxurious presidential suite.

Aside from brief intervals of nibbling on snacks, she barely moved, with Kristina even applying rejuvenating face masks for her.

On the fourth morning, Demi called unexpectedly, requesting Evelina’s presence at the Gibson Mansion.

It wasn’t difficult to guess the reason behind the call-no doubt it concerned the divorce.

Kristina, however, suspected something deeper.

She said, “I doubt it’s that simple. Apparently, Florrie Russell, the eldest granddaughter of the influential Russell family, recently went blind after suffering a severe head injury.”

“The family has exhausted their options with renowned specialists and is now desperately seeking Landen Mitchell’s elusive protege-the Sight Weaver.”

“Jasper Russell himself is arriving in Aglonard to oversee the search personally. Demi is the only one aware of your true identity, and I’m concerned she might try to-”

Evelina quickly reassured her. “Demi vowed never to expose my identity. Don’t worry.”

Kristina remained cautious. “Just make sure the Gibson family don’t take advantage of your skills again.”

“I’ll be careful,” Evelina replied firmly.

Still unconvinced, Kristina said decisively, “You won’t be meeting them looking like this.”  
Immediately after breakfast, Kristina summoned her private beauty team. “Your mission: revive our sleeping beauty.”

And they did. After ample rest, Evelina resembled a wilting flower that had finally received sunlight. Her skin was luminous, her features radiant, and the tiredness that had dimmed her gaze for years completely disappeared, replaced by clarity and allure.

With a refined cocktail dress and minimal yet tasteful makeup, Evelina transformed dramatically.

Kristina stood speechless for several moments before exclaiming, “Cary must’ve been utterly blind to trade a goddess for someone like Esme.”

Precisely on time, the Gibson family’s chauffeur-driven vehicle arrived. outside the hotel.  
Asher, the family’s longtime butler, personally came to escort her. Initially, he didn’t recognize Evelina at all.

He stared uncertainly until she greeted him, causing recognition to dawn suddenly. “Ms. Marsh?” He stumbled over his words. “You look absolutely extraordinary.”

Within half an hour, the car pulled up at the Gibson Mansion, with Asher quickly stepping out to courteously open her door.

“Is this Miss Russell herself?” Margot hurried forward, her expression instantly switching to flattery.

Today marked Jasper’s arrival, and Margot had meticulously styled herself since early morning, eager to capture his attention.

She figured it would just be Jasper showing up. The last thing she expected was a stunning woman standing at the door.

With that grace and confidence, who else could she be but a Russell?

“Margot, perhaps you should get your eyes checked.” Evelina’s tone was polite, edged with unmistakable disdain.

Margot’s mouth dropped open. “It’s you?” she whispered incredulously, jealousy flaring visibly as she examined Evelina closely.

At that precise moment, another vehicle approached. Cary stepped out gracefully, accompanied by Esme.

Yet when his gaze landed upon Evelina, he stopped abruptly, utterly captivated.

Just a few days had passed-how had she transformed so stunningly? Evelina radiated an effortless, compelling beauty.

Noticing Cary’s astonishment, Esme’s jaw tightened, though she maintained her gentle smile. “That’s your ex-wife, isn’t it?” she said softly.

“Since we’ve run into her, you might as well say hello. It must have been challenging for an orphan like her to follow you all this way.”

Esme spoke softly, but each word stung sharper than a slap-acting as if she, not Evelina, was the genuine Mrs. Gibson.

Startled out of her reverie, Margot immediately exploded in anger. “Evelina! Where did you get the money to dress up like this? Did you drain Cary’s accounts for your new face and that designer dress?”

Even Esme had opted for simplicity today, avoiding unnecessary attention. Seeing Evelina effortlessly steal the spotlight was unbearable for Margot.

She hesitated briefly before hissing spitefully, “Look at you, dressed like a tramp. Trying to win Cary back? You’re delusional!”

In a rage, Margot lunged forward, claws reaching viciously for Evelina’s dress and hair.

Quickly stepping in, Asher intervened firmly, “Miss Gibson, please! There are esteemed guests today-this isn’t appropriate behavior for a Gibson.”

Ignoring Asher’s plea, Margot shouted furiously, “I’ll rip that smug face of yours apart!”

Remaining composed, Evelina calmly raised her phone, recording Margot’s tantrum. With cold confidence, she replied, “Keep going. Let’s show Jasper Russell exactly how refined you really are.”

Margot froze instantly, eyes wide. Her threats died in her throat, replaced by a scorching glare. “You wouldn’t dare!”

Switching tactics, Margot theatrically leaned against Esme, feigning vulnerability. “Esme, please protect me. We’ll be family soon-you have to defend me.”

She emphasized “family” deliberately, aiming to needle Evelina.

Tenderly, Esme stroked Margot’s hair as if comforting a child. “It’s alright. Nobody will harm you as long as I’m here.”

Evelina scoffed sharply, “Where are Demi and Elora Gibson? Since when do outsiders dictate rules in this house?”

Esme’s expression turned rigid.

This wasn’t the gentle Evelina they all expected. How had she developed such an unexpectedly sharp tongue?

Margot quickly retorted, “Who’s the outsider? You’re the one who doesn’t belong here!” Turning to Cary, she said, “Did you hear what she said to Esme? You can’t let her bully us like that!”

With practiced grace. Esme sighed softly. “It’s okay. Evelina didn’t have parents to teach her manners.”

Evelina rolled her eyes, clearly irritated by Esme’s implication.

Yet Cary saw none of Evelina’s frustration. In his eyes, Esme’s gentle tolerance only amplified her perfection.

Stepping protectively toward Esme, Cary embraced her tenderly before turning coldly to Evelina.

His voice was cutting, saying, “If you think causing trouble will win you points, you’re mistaken. It’s pathetic. Apologize to Esme right now.

**Chapter 4** 

Without even sparing Cary a glance, Evelina replied curtly, “Maybe fix your own judgment before trying to lecture me.”

Determined to avoid further nonsense, she brushed past them swiftly, eager not to keep Demi waiting.

“Don’t you dare walk away from me!” Cary’s temper flared, readying himself to berate her once more-but his words vanished as his gaze caught her retreating figure.

Her tailored dress embraced her flawless curves perfectly, her hair cascaded effortlessly down her elegant back, accentuating her slender shoulders and defined waist-details he’d somehow overlooked until now.

Every confident step she took radiated strength, poise, and elegance.

Even the mere outline of her form seemed captivating enough to linger in his thoughts indefinitely.

It struck him painfully: this extraordinary woman was about to become his ex-wife, yet he hadn’t even touched her once.

Noticing Cary’s intense stare, Esme felt a wave of irritation surge through her, and she sharply pushed herself out of his arms, storming away.

Margot immediately panicked, tugging frantically at Cary’s sleeve. “What are you doing, Cary? You’ve upset Esme, and now she’s leaving!”

Cary blinked, momentarily disoriented, and by the time he regained his senses, Margot was already chasing after Esme.

Inside the mansion, Demi sat in solitude, leaning tiredly against her ornate pearwood chair, glancing anxiously toward the entrance every few moments.

Spotting Evelina, she brightened instantly, rising to welcome her affectionately. “Evi, my dear girl, you’ve endured so much.”

“Please don’t worry yourself, Demi.” Quickly approaching, Evelina gently helped her sit again, kneeling beside her to carefully massage her aching knees.

“The weather is getting chilly-are your joints troubling you again?”

Demi sighed deeply. “Same old pain, dear. No one eases it like you do; your treatments are irreplaceable.”

“You’ve treated me like family all these years, Demi. This is the very least I can do in return,” Evelina replied sincerely.

Her honest kindness only deepened Demi’s regret.

“That foolish grandson of mine-blindly letting go of such a gem! He deserves a beating,” Demi replied softly.

Evelina gave a gentle shake of her head. “It’s alright, Demi.”

Tenderly, Demi pleaded, “Evi, sweetheart… just once more, can you give Cary another chance-for my sake?”

“I’ve waited three long years for him to see me. He never did. Another chance wouldn’t change anything,” Evelina answered quietly.

She had offered countless opportunities, but Cary had repeatedly wasted them. It was finally time to let go.

Demi sighed heavily, sorrow evident in her tone. “Perhaps it’s just fate… our family wasn’t fortunate enough to hold onto someone like you.”

Her eyes glistened with tears.

Just then, Margot and Esme entered noisily, chattering cheerfully alongside Cary’s mother, Elora Gibson.

Demi’s temper erupted immediately.

She snatched up a nearby coffee cup and threw it furiously toward Esme’s feet.

Fragments of porcelain scattered violently, coffee splattering across Esme’s luxurious heels and the delicate fabric of her custom-made gown.

A sharp cry escaped Esme’s lips as she stared, utterly horrified. Though appearing deceptively understated, every stitch of her attire was meticulously selected from exclusive boutiques-her dress alone carried a hefty price, deliberately crafted to exude graceful elegance.

Predictably, the Gibson mother-and-daughter pair, notorious for their lack of fashion sense, were oblivious to its true value.

“What was that about, Grandma?” Cary exclaimed, swiftly stepping forward to shelter Esme once more, flashing a bitter glance toward Demi.

Demi, however, remained fiercely unapologetic. “How dare you even ask? Without this woman’s antics, would you have had your accident? Would you have lost your sight?”

More painful to Demi than Esme abandoning their engagement was the reality that Esme had almost irreversibly ruined Cary’s bright future.

Demi had always seen Cary as her greatest pride-Esme hadn’t just harmed her grandson, she’d damaged the entire Gibson legacy.

“I’ve said this countless times,” Cary responded in exasperation. “Esme wasn’t responsible for that accident. Why can’t you trust me?”

His accusing stare shifted pointedly toward Evelina, who was quietly comforting Demi, gently rubbing her back to ease her breathing.

It had to be Evelina causing trouble again-poisoning Demi’s mind.

Without restraint, he said sharply, “Evelina, have you been whispering lies to Grandma, stirring things up behind our backs?”

Seizing the opportunity, Elora, who had always despised Evelina’s modest upbringing, immediately spat venomously, saying, “Of course it’s her! That orphan would do anything to cling onto this family. She may act sweet, but beneath the surface, she’s utterly despicable!”

Before Evelina had the chance to defend herself, Demi interrupted harshly, “Enough! Evelina is the granddaughter-in-law I chose personally. Do you dare disrespect her right before my eyes? Are you openly challenging my authority?”

Elora blanched visibly, quickly stammering, “Demi, I didn’t mean-”

Seeing his mother close to tears, Cary intervened protectively, “Grandma, please stop scolding Mom. Let’s just face reality-you simply don’t want me to leave Evelina.”

Turning deliberately, he took Esme’s hand firmly into his own, fingers intertwined intimately. “But that’s non-negotiable. Esme is the one I love-she is my only future.”

“Excellent. Marvelous. Absolutely perfect,” Demi responded bitterly, each word dripping with harsh sarcasm. Anger visibly surged through her, shaking her frail body.

Reacting swiftly, Evelina retrieved a vial of heart medication, administering it carefully to Demi.

After a brief pause to regain composure, Demi said with cold certainty, “Then let me be clear. Divorce Evelina, and you must immediately surrender ten percent of your Gibson shares directly to her. And Esme? She will never set foot inside the Gibson household again while I’m alive.”

Demi Takes A Stand. With fierce authority, Demi’s frail hand slammed against her chair’s armrest, the sharp noise resonating clearly. “I’ve spoken, and my decision is final,” she replied resolutely. “Defy me, Cary, and you forfeit your place as a Gibson.

2. these **couches are staying and I hate them**, how can I position them to make the space work? the beige sectional doesnt fit anywhere else but could get creative.
3. I don't love **rugs** but i could be convinced - if needed, what colours? Links welcome 
4. The **TV** is on a makeshift rolling shelf because I use it about once per month. I recognize it is hideous, practical suggestions (sand and paint? what colours?) 
5. the piano is going, as is the lovely blue arm chair :( what to put in ""**the music corner""** instead?
6. **Curtain rails** \- remove? paint? do I even need them? there are no neighbours 
7. the **cables** will leave with my housemate, don't panic!

I am a SAHM currently and take care of her basically all the time, we also co-sleep her room (I am still nursing at night) while Dad sleeps in the main bedroom. She is also a bad sleeper and wakes up multiple times a night, so co-sleeping allows me to sleep a little more. He is working ""full time"" (officially, but in reality more like 5 hours a day most of the time).

I have two AITA questions.


1. AITA for waking him up to get dressed in the morning (closet is in the main bedroom)? Usually he goes back to sleep until he must get up for work or wants coffee (usually more like 9am +).. Baby girl wakes up around 6am, I change and dress her and make ourselves ready in the bathroom plus play / read for a while before entering the bedroom. 
Probably around 1-1.5 hours later. His alarm rings around 8 or 9 am depending on work schedule.  I go downstairs with baby girl to make breakfast and start the day with her then. He is also not very helpful with her thoughout the day - even when he is at home, I am still the default parent for everything (feeding, sleeping, diapers, crying , appointments, etc) which is annoying all day long.


2. He is annoyed I don't show him enough affection (kissing, holding Hands, cuddling,..) constantly, which I understand, but I don't have more capacity for showing love. All my love and affection goes to our daughter and I am extremely over-touched basically all the time. Physical contact is not my love language generally.. when I don't hold my daughter I just want to be left alone and not touched, just do something for myself / alone.

We also didn't have sex since her birth, which is also terrible for him - not for me, as I don't really like sex and don't want to have sex honesty, which he knows.. before birth we did have sex, not too much, but not like zero.

1lj6wgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lj6wgs/aitah_for_refusing_to_talk_to_my_mother_after/,AITAH for refusing to talk to my mother after getting a bad haircut?,"For context, I (14M) go to a private school that requires boys to maintain their hair length for proper grooming reasons and it gets checked every first Monday of the month. I obviously get the haircuts since not following can result in a violation, but as I grew older I started becoming self-conscious about how I look. It began in middle school when I got HORRIBLE bowl cuts that classmates and even close friends started making jokes about me and calling me nicknames and that’s how it always went. And every time I’d ask the barbers for the haircut I was going for (basically wasn’t too long but too short) they’d always cut it too short and it made me look awful and uncomfortable in my own body. So every summer break I never cut my hair. 

My mom is a hardworking woman and I adore her so much because I know how hard her and my dad work to bring food to the table for my younger brother and I. But sometimes, she can get really annoying and refuse to apologize for something that hurts my feelings and we would eventually just forget about it and continue like nothing happened, knowing well the wounds are clearly visible.

Well, as of writing this post, my summer break ends tomorrow as I enter my Sophomore year in high school and I loved my hair over the summer. But then my mom (37F) suggested I get a haircut since it’s grown “too long” and the haircut inspection was going to happen literally a week after school started. I was terrified. I insisted I should at least wait until the first day of school ends so I make a good first impression with my looks but she refused and said she would be too busy by then. On the way I started telling my mom for the 100th time in my life that every barber I go to doesn’t seem to get it right and that she knows exactly how I like it so she should tell the barber since I’m bad at explaining. I’ve also crashed out in front of my mom before because of a bad haircut, so she knows how serious this is for me. She agreed and even said she’d keep watch to make sure she knows the hair looked good. And I even agreed to stay at the mall for a couple extra minutes to get some last minute school supplies for me.

However, when we got to the barber shop at the mall we regularly go to she said the haircut I wanted and immediately hopped out the store and went on her phone. I’m a hard introvert so I can’t really just call out for my mom or tell the barber if gets too short. I got the haircut and shocker! It was horrible. It made me look like a five year old. My mom didn’t even look back at me once to check it but I still had to say “It looks good.” In front of the barber just so they could get paid. But once we left I told her it looked awful but she said it suited me but I didn’t really trust her because she always says that and I’m her son so IMO, it felt like it was a biased opinion. 

I just wanted to go home after buying my extra school stuff (which was basically hygiene supplies). But then she started going mini grocery shopping. Then after, went to buy pastries and spreads at a different store. Tried to go to a hygiene store to buy stuff (which was closed thank goodness). And I thought that was the end of it. My patience was running out and I felt like never being outside in  public again. But then she went to a donut shop and got herself a Coffee Jelly… When we got to the car we didn’t say a single word to each other cause I was slowly but surely getting impatient in front of her, she knew I said the haircut looked back and proceeded to go to 3 different shops, which is weird because she would NEVER go into a store without having a plan beforehand, and buy a butt load of items. When I arrived home, I didn’t even wait for her, I just straight up out the extra groceries on the table and went in my room. I am now figuring out how I will fix myself in under 24 hours before the first day of school starts.

I’m writing this because I’m asking if I was the asshole for getting mad at my mom for basically ruining my self-esteem and confidence because of this haircut. Obviously I know how tired parents can get from work life and other external factors, but honestly it just feels like she doesn’t care about how I want to look in front of my schoolmates and other people.

1lj6w8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lj6w8c/holding_pattern/,Holding Pattern,"Our plane was ordered into a Holding Pattern. That was 17 Hours Ago.

I’ve been working long-haul flights for seven years now. You pick up patterns. Passengers complain about turbulence in the first hour, then they get sleepy, then the cabin quiets down like a church. I used to love the stillness of that middle stretch—dark cabin, humming engines, people breathing in sync. But now?

Now it feels like a graveyard with tray tables.

We were about five hours into the Heathrow–Chicago route when it started. Everything had been textbook. Smooth air, full meal service, not a single drunken stag do. I was in the galley boiling water when the captain called us into the crew jumpseat area. The tone in his voice made my stomach go cold.

He said we’d just been ordered into a holding pattern. No explanation. Chicago Center told him the ground was experiencing ***“a high-security emergency”*** and advised all transatlantic flights to circle until further notice.

We’d all heard that term before—***“holding pattern.”*** Normally it means there’s congestion on the tarmac, weather delays, some VIP movement. But we weren’t even over Illinois yet. We were still over open water. The captain’s hands were shaking as he spoke. That scared me more than anything.

Then, thirty minutes later, our ACARS system lit up again. Short bursts of text-based information. Disjointed, garbled. Military designators, partial city codes. ***LHR—CONTACT LOST. JFK—IMPACT CONFIRMED. CDG—MULTIPLE.***

We asked him what “impact” meant. He didn’t answer.

We knew.

••

I remember the moment the crew stopped pretending.

We sat in the rear galley, whispering like kids caught doing something wrong. Beth, one of the seniors, said she used to work NATO liaison flights back in the day. She said if the cities were going dark like this, we wouldn’t be going home. Not tonight. Not ever.

We weren’t told to declare an emergency. No direction from ground. No safe harbor. No reroute. Just one final message: ***“Hold as long as possible. Await further.”***

That was ten hours ago.

We’re still holding.

••

The passengers don’t know. Not officially. The map screens still show us gliding slowly in lazy ovals above the Atlantic. I turned them off after a woman started crying. Said we’d passed the same cloud formation three times.

She’s not wrong.

We’re in a loop. Not for safety. Not for weather. We’re just up here, like a paper plane caught in limbo.

A man in 27C tried to FaceTime his wife an hour ago. Said the call connected but all he could hear was sirens and distant screaming. He just sat there staring at his phone like if he blinked it would vanish. Eventually, he threw up in his seat and hasn’t spoken since.

We gave up on the inflight entertainment after BBC World News flickered for a second—just long enough for a presenter to stammer something about ***“London… multiple strikes… Parliament… gone.”***

Then static. Followed by an Emergency Alert.

••

Outside the window, the world is on fire. We can’t see the cities, not directly—but we can see the sky reacting to their deaths. Dirty orange blooms pulse on the horizon like infected wounds in the clouds, each one smudging the atmosphere with another layer of soot. The turbulence isn’t violent—it’s slow and shuddering, like the sky itself is struggling to stay in one piece.

Ash rides the slipstreams at thirty thousand feet, coating the outer glass in streaks that look like fingerprints dragged by the dead. Every now and then there’s a flash, too distant to blind us, but close enough to feel in our teeth—just a silent strobe over the curve of the Earth, another capital erased. It’s like watching a planet die from the window of a waiting room.

One of the junior crew members, Jay, had a breakdown in the lavatory. Locked himself inside and screamed until his voice gave out. When we finally got the door open, he kept asking what country we were flying over. His face was pale, eyes wild. ***“Just tell me there’s still a country,”*** he said.

I didn’t have the heart to lie.

••

Fuel is the question now. That’s the thing nobody wants to say out loud.

We’re not a military aircraft. We’re a 777 with commercial tanks and standard reserves. The captain’s stretched it by throttling back and looping through thinner air corridors, but that’s a temporary fix.

We’ve been up here nearly sixteen hours. The math doesn’t work anymore.

And here’s the thing that keeps me up even when I’m standing: we don’t know where to land. Every major city has either gone dark or stopped transmitting. The places that are still *“online”* are rejecting contact. Iceland denied our relay ping. So did Dublin. So did Shannon. So did Madrid.

It’s like the whole world went dark and nobody told us.

••

A kid, maybe six or seven, asked me when we were landing. He had chocolate on his face and a model airplane in his lap. I said we’d be on the ground *“soon.”*

He smiled and said, ***“I hope it’s sunny.”***

I walked into the crew storage and cried so hard I bit my tongue to keep quiet.

••

Beth thinks we’re the safest people alive. ***“We’re thirty-five thousand feet above a mass grave,”*** she said. ***“If that’s not safe, I don’t know what is.”***

But even she’s looking gaunt now. She caught the captain staring at a printed map of Europe with three red Xs drawn on it. No city names. Just marks. That’s when she took off her watch and stopped checking the time.

••

People are starting to notice the silence.

Not the kind you get on a red-eye flight, but the unnatural kind. No radio chatter. No ATC. No other aircraft visible, not even contrails. One man stood up and said he hadn’t seen a single plane cross our flight path in hours. That’s not normal on a transatlantic route. Not even during COVID. The skies should be littered with crossings.

But it’s just us.

A metal ghost gliding above the world, kept in the air by old schedules and the assumption that someone, somewhere, is still listening.

••

Some of the crew want to tell the passengers the truth. Others say that would be a death sentence—that panic would do what the blasts haven’t. I don’t know where I stand. Maybe they deserve to know. Or maybe the kid with the chocolate on his face deserves ten more minutes of believing in a sunny landing.

Maybe that’s mercy.

••

The intercom just chirped.

It wasn’t the captain.

It was a voice I didn’t recognize. A woman. Calm, American accent, like a call center operator.

She said:
***“Flight 389, you are currently designated Condition Echo. Maintain altitude. Do not attempt contact. All international emergency protocols are suspended.”***

Then silence.

Beth thinks ***“Condition Echo”*** means exposure. Not radiation—knowledge. That we know too much. That we’re witnesses to the fallout, literally. The people below can hide in bunkers or burn in cities. We’re proof that someone survived. Someone saw it happen from above.

Maybe that’s why no one’s answering.

••

The captain made an announcement.

Not a real one—he called the crew back and closed the curtain. His voice was quiet, eyes red. He said we had fuel for maybe another hour, max. That he’d sent out a Mayday. No response. That even military frequencies were silent now.

He said the plane had a last-ditch ditching protocol, but that was *“not ideal”* over open water. Which I think was pilot-speak for we’re screwed.

Then he said the quiet part out loud.

***“I think we’re the last people alive.”***

No one spoke for a long time after that.

••

Thirty minutes ago, the captain changed course.

He didn’t say where to. Just adjusted heading and dropped altitude slightly. The plane banked slowly southward. Over the PA, he told passengers we were preparing for descent, but didn’t give a destination. Just said we’d be landing *“shortly.”*

It started in whispers—tight, frantic murmurs passed between rows like static, eyes flicking to phones that no longer connected, maps that no longer updated. Then someone stood up and demanded answers, and when none came, the cabin cracked. 

A woman screamed at the emergency exit like it was a doorway to salvation. A man tried to call his wife, then sobbed into the seatback when he heard nothing but silence. The air felt thinner, heavier, like fear was eating the oxygen. Children cried without understanding why. Grown men argued over whether the lights meant we were landing or crashing. 

No one listened to the crew anymore. Seatbelt signs blinked uselessly above heads that no longer stayed seated. It wasn’t chaos—it was collapse. A slow, creeping unraveling as everyone realized, one by one, that we weren’t going home.

Some people held hands. Some cried. The man in 27C started singing under his breath.

I stood in the galley and looked at the sky and waited for anything. A coastline. A port. A flare. A voice.

But there was nothing.

Just water.

••

We’re still descending.

Low now. Too low. Engines throttled back so far they’re whispering. The sea looks like glass.

I don’t think there’s a runway down there.

I don’t think there’s anything down there.

If anyone finds this phone—if anyone finds me—we were Flight 389, London to Chicago, departed 04:06 UTC. The crew did everything they could. We kept them calm. We fed the children. We handed out warm towels. We kept the coffee hot. We lied like saints.

Not because we wanted to—but because hope was all we had left to serve.

We’re descending now.

*Still nowhere land.*

Ever feel like you're drowning in a sea of ideas, but when it comes to actually creating content, you're stuck? *Yep, me too.* It’s like the universe throws endless inspiration our way, but when we sit down to write, it’s like staring at an empty page with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a Sunday. I think we can all agree that we want to *work smarter, not harder*, am I right? 😅

So here’s the good news: **We’re having a Live Creator Workshop this week!** 🚀 And trust me, you won’t want to miss this. It’s all about scaling your content game—not just in quantity but quality too. 📝✨

Here’s a little sneak peek of what’s in store:

- **Real-Life Strategies**: We’re diving into practical tips you can implement right away. Think workflows that make your life easier and help you pump out killer content. 
- **Creative Brainstorming**: Stuck in a creative rut? This is where we'll unlock ideas with fun prompts and group brainstorming. Let’s get those gears turning!
- **Tech Talk**: We’ll cover tools that can speed up your processes—because who wouldn’t want more time to binge-watch their favorite shows? 

And you know what’s the best part? **It’s all about community!** 🥳 We’re in this together, and I know we have some brilliant minds in our group just waiting to share their wisdom.

Just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who gave us tips before our trip – me and two friends (visiting from Norway 🇳🇴) spent one full day in Philly on May 30, and it ended up being a total highlight of our time in the US. [see original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philly/comments/1k9w7cc/visiting_philly_any_suggestions_for_mustsee_places/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

We started the morning at **Reading Terminal Market**, which was such a fun mix of smells, flavors, and people – the coffee was great, and I had a macadamia nut cookie that I’m still thinking about. We had breakfast there too – simple but good.

From there, we walked through **Old City**: Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Elfreth’s Alley – and chilled for a bit in **Washington Square Park**. Such a charming area.

We grabbed cheesesteaks at **Sonny's**, and then slowly made our way toward the **Art Museum** for some Rocky steps and river views along **Kelly Drive**.

We ended our day by driving south towards **Wilmington**, just in time for sunset – great day, great vibes, and a perfect way to wrap it up.

Thanks again for the local knowledge – this sub really made our planning easier and helped us get the most out of the time we had.

- I'm an avid coffee drinker (some might say an addict), so a while ago she gets me a manual coffee grinder as a ""present"" (?)

- I still use pre-ground coffee powder mostly, for convenience

- A week ago, she buys pretty expensive, but not very good coffee beans, which pisses me off, since we're short on money. There's an argument.

- So, I guess I'll grind, since it's already there. Yesterday, for some reason some small bean bits land on the kitchen floor, there's an argument. She will not let me clean it, she'll do it angrily.

- In the evening I find the grinder is gone, she's asleep so I write a note asking where it is.

- Today I get up, I find a noted reply saying SHE WILL SMASH EVERYTHING HERE TO PIECES if there's coffee on the floor again....and she's on the verge of a breakdown because she has to clean all day...etc.

1lj6jez,https://youtu.be/hqb7Ttu95sc,3 Very Scary TRUE Rural Delivery Horror Stories,"# ""Flagged for Danger"":

I’ve been delivering packages for five years, winding through rural backroads where fields stretch forever and houses sit far apart. The quiet out here is peaceful, but those long, twisting driveways always make my stomach twist a little. Most days are routine—drop a box, maybe chat with a customer, and keep moving. But one Tuesday, my last delivery turned into a nightmare I can’t shake.The day started like any other. My van was loaded with packages, and I was checking addresses off my list. Early on, I stopped at a small house with a tidy garden. An old lady with a warm smile opened the door, holding a plate of homemade cookies. “You work so hard, dear,” she said, her voice soft. “Take a cookie for the road.”“Thanks, ma’am, but I’ve got a tight schedule,” I said, smiling back. “Maybe next time.” She waved as I jogged back to the van, her kindness lingering in my mind. It was a good moment, the kind that makes the job feel worthwhile. But as the hours passed, the houses got farther apart, and the roads turned from pavement to gravel. The countryside felt emptier, and that uneasy feeling started creeping in, like a shadow I couldn’t shake.By late afternoon, I was down to my last delivery. The GPS showed an address deep in the sticks, a place buried behind a thick wall of oak and pine trees. The driveway was a narrow, mile-long ribbon of gravel, curving through the woods. I gripped the steering wheel tighter as the trees closed in around me, their branches scraping the van’s roof. The GPS beeped, and I glanced at the screen: “Deliver to rear door.” My heart sank. Rear door deliveries in rural areas are the worst—too far from the road, too far from help. But it was my last stop, so I took a deep breath and told myself to get it done.I pulled up to the house, a big, rundown place with peeling white paint and a sagging front porch. The yard was overgrown, with tall grass and weeds choking an old swing set. A doghouse sat off to the side, a rusty chain snaking into the dirt, but no dog in sight. I scanned the windows, looking for movement, but the house was still, almost too still. My boots crunched on the gravel as I stepped out, grabbing the package—a small, light box wrapped in brown tape. I tucked it under my arm and started down the path to the back, my eyes darting around.The path was narrow, lined with thorny bushes that snagged at my pants. My heart was beating faster now, though I couldn’t pinpoint why. Maybe it was the silence—no birds, no wind, just the sound of my own footsteps. I reached the rear door, a flimsy screen thing with a torn mesh at the bottom. I raised my hand to knock when a low, guttural growl froze me in place. I turned slowly, my breath catching in my throat. Two pit bulls stood maybe ten feet away, heads low, ears back, teeth bared. Their eyes were locked on me, dark and malicious, like they were sizing me up.My stomach twisted into a knot. “Easy, boys,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. I held the package out in front of me, like it could protect me somehow. The dogs didn’t move, but their growls grew louder, rumbling deep in their chests. I took a slow step back, my eyes never leaving them. Then, without warning, they charged.“Stay back!” I shouted, my voice cracking. I stumbled backward, my foot catching on a garden hose coiled in the grass. I hit the ground hard, pain shooting through my elbow as the package flew from my hands. The dogs were on me in a flash, barking so loud it felt like the sound was inside my skull. One lunged, its teeth snapping inches from my leg, tearing a rip in my jeans. I kicked wildly, my boots connecting with air as I scrambled to my feet. The package lay forgotten in the dirt as I ran for the van.My boots pounded the ground, the dogs’ paws thumping right behind me. Their barks were deafening, a mix of rage and hunger that sent chills down my spine. I could feel their hot breath, hear their jaws snapping, so close I thought they’d grab me any second. The van was parked at the end of the path, maybe thirty feet away, but it felt like a mile. I pushed harder, my lungs burning, my heart hammering in my chest. I reached the van, yanking the door open and diving inside. One of the dogs lunged, its teeth grazing my shoe as I slammed the door shut. I fumbled with the lock, my hands shaking so bad I could barely grip it.The dogs didn’t stop. They circled the van, jumping and clawing at the windows, their barks echoing inside the metal walls. I pressed myself against the seat, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps. My hands were trembling, my whole body buzzing with adrenaline. I kept picturing those teeth, those eyes, and what would’ve happened if I hadn’t made it to the van.Then I saw him—a man, maybe forty, stepping out from the back door. He was tall, with a scruffy beard and a faded flannel shirt tucked into worn jeans. He clapped his hands sharply, shouting, “Max! Duke! Come here!” The dogs froze, glancing back at him, then trotted over like obedient pets. Their tails wagged, but their eyes still flicked toward me, like they weren’t done.I cracked the window, just enough to talk. “Your dogs almost got me,” I said, my voice shaking with anger and fear. “They could’ve hurt me bad.”The man shrugged, a lazy half-smile on his face. “Sorry about that. They’re usually tied up. Must’ve forgotten today.” His tone was too casual, like he was talking about forgetting his keys. He walked closer, his boots crunching on the gravel, and leaned toward the window. “You got my package?”I glanced at the floor, where the package had slid during my scramble. It was gone—left in the dirt when I fell. “It’s back there,” I said, pointing toward the path. “I dropped it when your dogs came at me.”He squinted at me, his smile fading. “You should’ve honked,” he said, his voice flat. “They don’t like strangers.” He turned and walked back toward the house, whistling for the dogs. They followed, but one glanced back at me, its lips curling in a silent snarl. I watched them disappear around the corner, my hands still gripping the steering wheel.I didn’t leave right away. I sat there, trying to calm my racing heart, replaying the moment in my head. If I’d been slower, if I’d tripped again, I might not have made it. I finally started the van and drove back to the depot, my knuckles white on the wheel. The whole way, I kept checking my rearview mirror, half-expecting those dogs to come tearing down the road.At the depot, I marched straight to my supervisor’s office. “Those dogs almost tore me apart,” I said, leaning on the counter. “The guy didn’t even care. Just shrugged it off.”My supervisor, a tired-looking guy with graying hair, frowned and grabbed a clipboard. “Give me the address. I’ll flag it for next time.” He scribbled a note, but his face said he’d heard this before. “Stay safe out there,” he added, already turning back to his computer.I wasn’t done. Over coffee in the break room, I told a coworker, a guy who’d been driving longer than me. He listened, stirring his coffee slowly. “You’re lucky,” he said, his voice low. “Few months back, another driver wasn’t. Same deal—rear door delivery, rural place. Dogs got him. He didn’t make it to the van.”My blood ran cold. “Nobody told me,” I whispered, my coffee cup suddenly heavy in my hands.He nodded, staring into his mug. “Yeah. They don’t like to talk about it. Scares the new guys.” He paused, then added, “That house you went to? It’s been flagged before. Same dogs, same guy. Nobody does anything.”I went home that night, but I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those dogs—those dark, hateful eyes, those snapping teeth. I kept hearing the man’s voice, so calm, so unbothered. I started carrying pepper spray the next day, clipped to my belt like a lifeline. I stopped doing rear door deliveries, too. If the instructions say “rear door,” I honk and wait, or I leave the package at the mailbox. I don’t care if it’s against policy.But every time I drive down a long, quiet driveway, that fear comes back. I scan for doghouses, for chains, for any sign of trouble. I can still feel those dogs behind me, their barks ringing in my ears, and I wonder if the next house will have someone—or something—waiting, just out of sight.

  


# ""The Bag in the Mailbox"":

I’ve been a rural mail carrier for twelve years, driving the same winding roads through fields and woods, delivering letters and packages to folks who live miles apart. The job’s mostly quiet, just me and my old mail truck, the engine humming as I bounce along gravel paths. I’ve seen plenty—deer darting across the road, stray dogs chasing my tires—but nothing prepared me for what happened last summer. It was a day that started ordinary but turned into something so creepy it still haunts me, and it was all real, no ghosts or monsters, just the kind of fear that sticks in your bones.That morning, I was at the post office, sorting mail under the fluorescent lights. My coworker, Jim, was there, leaning on the counter with his usual mug of coffee. He looked tired, his eyes scanning the room like he was waiting for something. “You hear about the east route?” he said, his voice low. “Folks say someone’s been tampering with mailboxes. Smashing ‘em, stealing packages. Even found one with weird stuff inside.”  
I paused, shoving a stack of envelopes into a bin. “Weird stuff? Like what?”  
He shrugged, but his face was serious. “Nobody’s sure. Could be kids, could be worse. Just watch yourself out there.”  
I nodded, trying to brush it off. “Probably just bored teenagers,” I said, grabbing my keys. But as I loaded my truck, Jim’s words clung to me like damp air. I’d been on this route long enough to know the countryside wasn’t always as peaceful as it looked.The drive started normal. The roads were empty, just endless stretches of gravel and dirt, flanked by tall grass and patches of trees. Houses sat far back, some barely visible, their mailboxes the only sign anyone lived there. I stopped at each one, sliding letters into metal slots, tossing packages into bigger boxes. But as I got deeper into the route, a strange feeling settled in my chest, like the world was too quiet. No birds chirped. No dogs barked. Even the cicadas, usually screaming this time of year, seemed muted.By midday, I reached the Carter place. Their mailbox was at the end of a long, narrow driveway, maybe a quarter-mile of rutted dirt lined with weeds and shrubs. The house itself was hidden, tucked behind a wall of pines, so you’d never know it was there unless you looked hard. I always got a bad vibe from that stop. The driveway felt like a tunnel, the greenery closing in, and the air always seemed heavier, like it was pressing down on you.I pulled my truck to the side of the road and grabbed the Carter’s mail—a few bills, a catalog, and a small padded envelope. I stepped out, my boots crunching on gravel, and walked the ten feet to the mailbox. It was an old metal box, rusted at the edges, nailed to a wooden post that looked ready to fall over. As I got closer, I noticed something off. The mailbox door was half-open, and the post was leaning, like someone had kicked it or tried to yank it out.  “Great,” I muttered, glancing around. The road was empty, no cars, no people, just fields stretching out under a wide sky. I figured it was vandalism, like Jim said, but it still made my skin prickle. I reached to open the mailbox wider, but then I saw it—something inside, tucked against the back wall. It wasn’t mail. It was a plastic grocery bag, knotted tight, the plastic streaked with dirt and something darker, like oil or mud.  My stomach twisted. This wasn’t right. I stood there, holding the Carter’s mail, my eyes locked on the bag. Part of me wanted to leave it and move on, but I couldn’t just ignore it. What if it was important? Or dangerous? Jim’s warning about “weird stuff” flashed through my mind. I set the mail on the ground and pulled a pen from my pocket, using it to nudge the bag out. It slid forward and dropped into the dirt with a soft, heavy thud.  The bag was small, about the size of a grapefruit, but it felt wrong, too dense for its size. I crouched, keeping my distance, and poked it with the pen. A smell hit me—sharp, sickly sweet, like rotting meat mixed with something chemical. I gagged, covering my nose with my sleeve. My heart started pounding, a steady thump I could feel in my ears. Whatever was in that bag, it wasn’t trash or lost groceries. It was something bad.I stood up, scanning the driveway. The pines loomed, their shadows long and dark, and the path to the house disappeared into them. I felt exposed, like someone was watching me from those trees. I grabbed my radio, my fingers fumbling with the clip. “Jim, you there?” I said, trying to keep my voice calm.  
“Yo, what’s up?” His voice crackled through, casual but alert.  
“There’s a bag in the Carter mailbox. It’s not mail. Smells… awful. Like something died.”  
A long pause. “Don’t touch it,” he said, his tone sharp now. “Could be drugs, could be something worse. You alone out there?”  
“Yeah,” I said, my eyes darting to the trees. “Just me and this thing.”  
“Call it in,” he said. “And get back to your truck. Now.”  I clipped the radio back, my hands shaky. I bent to pick up the Carter’s mail, still lying in the dirt. That’s when I heard it—a rustle in the tall grass, maybe twenty feet away. I froze, pen still in hand, my breath catching. It wasn’t the wind. The sound was deliberate, like footsteps, slow and careful.  “Who’s there?” I called, louder than I meant. My voice echoed, unanswered. The rustling stopped, but then it came again, closer, from the other side of the driveway. I spun around, my eyes searching the weeds. Nothing moved, but I could feel it—someone, something, was out there. My skin crawled, and my pulse raced so fast it made my head spin.  I backed toward the truck, keeping the mailbox in my sight. The bag sat in the dirt, its dark contents bulging against the plastic. I didn’t want to turn my back on it—or whatever was hiding in the grass. The rustling came again, now behind me, near the road. I whipped around, but all I saw was my truck, its white paint glinting, the door still open from when I’d stepped out.  “Show yourself!” I shouted, my voice cracking. Silence answered, heavy and thick, like the world was holding its breath. I clutched the mail tighter, my knuckles white, and took another step back. My boot hit a rock, and I stumbled, catching myself against the truck. That’s when I saw it—a shadow moving at the edge of the driveway, where the pines met the path.  It was a man, tall and lean, wearing a dark hooded jacket. He stepped out from the trees, slow, like he didn’t care if I saw him. His hood was up, hiding his face, but I could feel his eyes on me, cold and steady. He didn’t move closer, just stood there, hands in his pockets, head tilted slightly.  My mouth went dry. I scrambled into the truck, slamming the door and locking it. My hands shook so bad I could barely get the key in the ignition. I grabbed the radio again. “Jim, there’s someone here,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “A guy, at the Carter place. He’s just… standing there.”  
“Get out of there,” Jim said, urgent now. “Drive, now. I’m calling the sheriff.”  I started the engine, my eyes locked on the man. He hadn’t moved, just stood at the edge of the trees, watching. I floored the gas, the truck lurching forward, tires kicking up dust and gravel. In the rearview mirror, I saw him take a step onto the driveway, still staring, his hood casting a shadow over his face. He didn’t chase me, didn’t wave, just watched as I sped away.  I didn’t stop until I reached the next house, a mile down the road. I pulled over, my chest heaving, sweat soaking my uniform. I could still see that bag in my mind, the smell burning my nose, and that man, silent and still, like he knew something I didn’t. I radioed the sheriff, my words tripping over each other. “There’s a bag at the Carter place,” I said. “Smells like something dead. And a guy—he came out of the trees, just watching me.”  The deputy met me at the post office later that day. I sat in the break room, a bottle of water in my hands, still shaking. I told him everything—the bag, the smell, the rustling, the man. He listened, scribbling in a notebook, his face unreadable. “We checked the Carter place,” he said finally. “Found the bag. You were smart not to open it.”  
“What was it?” I asked, my voice barely audible.  
He hesitated, glancing at his notes. “Animal organs. Heart, maybe some others. Packed in some kind of chemical, like they were trying to preserve it. Could be a sick prank, could be something else.”  
I swallowed hard. “And the guy?”  
“No sign of him,” he said. “No footprints, no tire tracks. Just the bag and a busted mailbox. We’re watching the place, but… stay sharp out there.”  I nodded, but his words didn’t ease the knot in my stomach. I finished my route that day, but every stop felt like a trap. Every mailbox made me pause, checking for bags, for shadows, for anything. The rustling sound followed me, or maybe it was just in my head, echoing every time I stepped out of the truck.  When I got back to the post office, Jim was waiting by the door. “You okay?” he asked, his eyes searching my face.  
“No,” I said, honest for once. “Who does that, Jim? Leaves a bag like that? Watches from the trees?”  
He shook his head, his mouth a grim line. “Out here, you get all kinds. People hiding things, doing things. You just keep your eyes open and your doors locked.”  I still drive that route. The Carter mailbox is fixed now, the post straightened, the rust painted over. But I check it twice before I open it, my heart pounding every time. I haven’t seen that man again, haven’t found another bag, but I feel him sometimes, or something like him, in the quiet of the route. Every rustle in the grass, every shadow in the trees, makes my blood run cold.  The sheriff never figured out who left that bag or why. They called it a prank, maybe hunters messing around, but I know what I saw. That man wasn’t a hunter. He wasn’t a kid pulling a joke. He was watching me, waiting, and out here, where the nearest help is miles away, that’s the kind of fear that doesn’t let go. I keep driving, keep delivering, but I’m never alone anymore—not with that memory following me down every road.

  


# ""Unopened Boxes"":

I was on my night shift, driving the delivery van through endless country roads that twisted like veins through the dark. The headlights carved a narrow path ahead, barely touching the dense woods on either side. Trees loomed close, their branches scraping the van’s roof now and then, making me flinch. I’d been a driver for six months, but these rural routes always set my nerves on edge. The isolation, the quiet—it felt like the world was holding its breath. Tonight, my last stop was a house buried deep in the backcountry, miles from the nearest town.My GPS pinged, directing me onto a dirt path so narrow the van’s sides brushed against overgrown bushes. The road was rough, full of ruts and rocks that jolted the van, rattling the packages in the back. My dashboard clock read 11:47 p.m., and I was already behind schedule. The signal on my phone flickered, one bar, then none. I gripped the wheel tighter, my palms sweaty despite the chill in the air. After what felt like an hour, though it was probably only ten minutes, I spotted a mailbox, rusted and leaning like it hadn’t been touched in years. Weeds choked its base, and the numbers painted on it were faded, but they matched the address on my delivery slip.The driveway stretched into the shadows, long and winding, disappearing into the trees. I turned in, the van lurching over the uneven ground. My headlights caught glimpses of the house ahead—a sagging, two-story structure that looked like it belonged in a nightmare. The paint was peeling in strips, exposing rotted wood. Most windows were boarded up, though a few had cracked glass that glinted like broken teeth. The porch was cluttered with junk: a broken chair, stacks of newspapers tied with twine, and a rusted bicycle missing a wheel. A single bulb hung above the door, flickering like it was on its last breath, casting jittery shadows across the yard.I parked and sat for a moment, engine idling, staring at the house. My gut twisted, urging me to leave the package and go, but company policy was clear: get a signature or confirm delivery in person. I grabbed the package—a small, light box with no return address, taped sloppily—and checked the label again. “Resident,” it read, no name. That wasn’t unusual for rural deliveries, but it didn’t help the unease crawling up my spine. I stepped out, my boots crunching on the gravel, and the sour smell hit me: damp wood, rotting leaves, and something sharper, like spoiled meat. The air felt heavy, pressing against my skin.I walked to the porch, each step louder than the last. The boards creaked under my weight, and I half-expected them to give way. I knocked on the door, the sound dull and swallowed by the silence. “Delivery!” I called, my voice too loud in the quiet. Nothing. I knocked again, harder, the door rattling in its frame. Still no answer. I glanced back at the van, its headlights glowing like eyes in the dark, tempting me to leave. But then I heard it—a slow, dragging sound from inside, like bare feet shuffling across a wooden floor. My heart thudded, and I gripped the package tighter.The door creaked open, an inch at first, then wider, revealing a man standing in the shadows. He was tall, painfully thin, his frame swallowed by a stained flannel shirt and baggy pants held up by a frayed belt. His face was gaunt, cheekbones sharp under pale, waxy skin. His eyes were wide, unblinking, and bloodshot, like he hadn’t slept in days. His lips twitched into a smile that didn’t reach those eyes, showing yellowed teeth. His hair was thin, greasy, plastered to his scalp in clumps. He smelled of unwashed skin and that same sour rot I’d noticed outside, strong enough to make my stomach churn.“You got my order?” he rasped, his voice low and dry, like he hadn’t spoken in weeks.I held up the box, forcing my voice steady. “Yes, sir. Right here. Need you to sign for it.”He didn’t move to take it or sign. Instead, he stared at me, head tilting slightly, like a predator sizing up prey. “You’re late,” he said, his smile fading. “I’ve been waiting a long time.”“Sorry,” I said, shifting my weight. “The roads out here are hard to find.”He stepped closer, into the flickering light of the porch bulb. His fingers twitched at his sides, long and bony, nails chipped and dirty. “Come in,” he said, his tone flat but insistent. “I need to check it’s right.”Every instinct screamed to run. “I can leave it here, sir,” I said, taking a step back. “You can check it yourself.”“No!” he snapped, his voice sharp enough to make me jump. His eyes narrowed, and he leaned forward. “You come in. I need to see it’s what I ordered.”I hesitated, my mind racing. I could drop the box and bolt, but he was fast, I could tell—those long legs, that wiry frame. And the van was twenty feet away. I didn’t want to turn my back on him. “Just a quick check,” I said, more to calm myself than him. “Then I’ve got other deliveries.”He nodded, stepping aside, and I crossed the threshold, clutching the box like a shield. The door clicked shut behind me, and I heard the lock slide into place. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might burst. The house was dark, lit only by a single lamp in the corner of what looked like a living room. The air was thick with dust, mold, and that rotting smell, now so strong it coated my throat. The floor was littered with trash—empty food cans, crumpled papers, and a few broken dishes. Furniture was pushed against the walls: a sagging couch covered in stains, a bookshelf stuffed with moldy magazines, and a table in the center piled with more cans and a cracked plate crusted with dried food. A single chair sat by the table, its upholstery torn, stuffing spilling out.“Open it,” he said, standing too close, his breath hot on my neck.I set the box on the table, my hands trembling. “I don’t have a knife,” I said, hoping he’d back off.He didn’t. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a rusty kitchen knife, its blade pitted and stained. My breath caught. “Use this,” he said, holding it out, handle first.I shook my head. “I’ll just tear it open.” I clawed at the tape, my fingers slipping, finally ripping the box apart. Inside was a plastic container, the kind for storing leftovers, but it was empty. I lifted it out, confused. “This is it,” I said, showing him.His face twisted, eyes blazing. “Empty?” he hissed, snatching the container. He shook it, as if food might magically appear. “You’re lying. Where’s my order?”“I don’t know,” I said, backing toward the door. “This is what was in the box. Maybe it’s a mistake.”He slammed the container on the table, the sound echoing in the quiet house. “You took it!” he shouted, pointing the knife at me. “You stole my food!”“No!” I raised my hands, heart racing. “I didn’t take anything. I swear!”He lunged, shoving me against the wall. My shoulder slammed into the plaster, pain shooting down my arm. He leaned in, his face inches from mine, eyes wild. “I know what you’re doing. You’re keeping it for yourself, just like the others.”“What others?” I gasped, trying to push him off, but he was stronger than he looked, his bony fingers digging into my arms.“The ones who never bring my food,” he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. “They send empty boxes, laughing at me, starving me.”I tried to stay calm, my mind scrambling for a way out. “Sir, I didn’t take anything. Maybe the warehouse messed up. I can call my boss, get you another delivery.”He laughed, a sharp, ugly sound that sent chills down my spine. “No calls. No one’s coming.” He grabbed my wrist, yanking me toward a door at the back of the room. I stumbled, fighting to pull free, but his grip was like iron.“Where are you taking me?” I asked, my voice breaking.“My pantry,” he said, his tone eerily calm now. “You’ll stay there till you give me what I need.”The door led to a narrow hallway, the walls covered in peeling wallpaper that curled like dead skin. The floor was sticky, and the air grew colder, heavier. At the end was another door, heavy and wooden, with a padlock dangling from a rusty latch. My stomach dropped. I twisted in his grip, kicking at his shins, but he barely flinched, dragging me closer to the door.“Please,” I begged, tears stinging my eyes. “Let me go. I’ll get you food, I promise.”He ignored me, fumbling with the padlock, the knife still in his other hand. His fingers shook, and the lock wouldn’t open. “Stupid thing,” he muttered, banging the knife against it.I saw my chance. I stomped on his foot, grinding my heel into his toes. He yelped, his grip loosening, and I tore free, sprinting back down the hall. My boots pounded the floor, echoing in the tight space. He roared behind me, his footsteps heavy and fast. I burst into the living room, eyes locked on the front door. I reached it, my fingers scrambling at the deadbolt, but it was stuck, rusted in place.“You can’t leave!” he screamed, his voice closer now.I yanked harder, the bolt finally giving way with a groan. I flung the door open and stumbled onto the porch, the cold air hitting my face. I ran for the van, my breath ragged, my legs burning. His footsteps pounded behind me, gravel crunching under his bare feet. I reached the driver’s door, yanked it open, and climbed in, slamming it shut. My hands shook as I fumbled the key into the ignition.He reached the van, his face pressed against the window, eyes wild, teeth bared. He banged the knife handle against the glass, a crack spiderwebbing across it. “You’re not going anywhere!” he shouted, his voice muffled but furious.I turned the key. The engine sputtered, coughed, then died. My heart stopped. He hit the window again, the crack widening. I twisted the key once more, praying, pumping the gas pedal. The engine roared to life, and I threw the van into reverse, tires spinning, gravel flying. He chased me, swinging the knife, his shadow lunging in the headlights. I floored it, backing down the driveway, branches scraping the van’s sides. The van lurched onto the main road, and I shifted into drive, speeding away, my hands trembling on the wheel.I glanced in the rearview mirror. He stood in the road, a dark silhouette, the knife glinting in his hand. His eyes locked on mine, even from that distance, and I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cold. I drove for miles, not daring to slow down, my breath coming in short, sharp gasps. My phone was useless, still no signal, and the GPS was frozen, stuck on that cursed address.Finally, I saw the glow of a gas station, its neon sign a beacon in the dark. I pulled into the lot, parking under the brightest light, and locked the doors. My hands shook so badly I could barely dial 911. When the operator answered, I spilled everything, my voice cracking as I described the house, the man, the knife. They told me to stay put, that a patrol car was on its way.The police arrived twenty minutes later, two officers with flashlights and serious faces. I told them everything again, pointing them to the road I’d come from. They took my statement, then drove out to the house. I waited at the station, sipping bitter coffee from a styrofoam cup, my mind replaying every moment—the shuffle of his feet, the glint of the knife, the way his eyes never blinked.Hours later, an officer came back to update me. They’d found the house, just as I described, but it was empty. No man, no knife, just stacks of unopened delivery boxes, dozens of them, scattered across the living room. They pried a few open—empty plastic containers, every single one. The pantry door was unlocked, leading to a small, bare room with scratches on the walls, like someone had clawed at them. The officer said it looked like a squatter’s hideout, maybe someone with a mental illness, obsessed with deliveries that never held what he wanted. They found no trace of him, no footprints, no sign he’d fled. It was like he’d vanished.I quit the job the next week, unable to face another night on those roads. I moved to the city, where lights and people keep the darkness at bay. But I still check my locks every night, sometimes twice. I keep a flashlight by my bed, and I jump at every creak in the house. I can’t shake the image of his face at the window, those unblinking eyes, or the feeling that somewhere, out in the shadows, he’s still waiting for his next delivery—and wondering if it’ll be me.",1,1750757150.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

If you imagine Bali without noisy parties and endless beaches—welcome to **Ubud**. This area in the center of the island has long been a mecca for those seeking spiritual retreat, traditional crafts, and untouched nature.  

Why is Ubud Special?

- Cultural Capital: Here, you can watch kecak dances, see woodcarving, admire batik paintings, and listen to gamelan music. Check out the Ubud Palace or an evening performance at Pura Dalem.  
- Lush Jungles: The Tegalalang Rice Terraces, the sacred Monkey Forest (watch out for thieving macaques!), and hidden waterfalls like Tibumana.  
- Yoga & Wellness: Dozens of studios (like Yoga Barn) and Ayurvedic clinics.  

What You Won’t Find Here
  
Rowdy nightclubs or crowds of surfer tourists. Ubud is about slow walks, meditating by the river, and sipping luwak coffee with jungle views.  

Tips  
- Rent a scooter to explore nearby villages (Penglipuran, Mas).  
https://balimotion.pro/Rent bikes in Bali 

- Try babi guling (suckling pig) at Ibu Oka.  
- Don’t miss the Ubud Market—the best souvenirs are handmade statues or sarongs, not fridge magnets.  

📍 How to Get There: 1–1.5 hours from Denpasar (taxi ~300k IDR / ~$20).

Nathan Reid was in love. Like, fully stupid-in-the-head, daydreaming-at-stoplights, talking-to-his-laptop-screen in love. And her name was Sophie MacQuoid.



She was bright, funny, genuinely kind, and had the type of laugh that made bad days worth surviving. Nathan met her six months ago at a panel on sustainable tech startups. She was wearing this slightly wrinkled dress and taking notes with an actual pen on actual paper. They’d bumped into each other at the coffee table after the talk and started arguing about composting. He asked her out before he even knew her last name.



They’d been inseparable ever since.



She didn’t care that his apartment had two IKEA chairs and one suspicious plant. She didn't even blink when he revealed that his startup, LeafLoop, wasn’t profitable yet but had ""incredible moral ROI."" And she never asked about the time-consuming mystery side project he kept under wraps.



The one called LangstonLeaks.



See, Nathan had another love: justice. And an old, burning hatred for corporate sociopaths. Especially Victor Langston, the silver-haired, gold-plated billionaire whose entire empire was built on crushed small businesses and shady land deals. Langston Holdings had steamrolled Nathan’s neighborhood when he was seventeen, turning an old community into a ""Luxury Innovation District"" with yoga rooftops and twelve-dollar cupcakes.



So Nathan made a hobby of leaking Victor's secrets—anonymously. Financial documents. Hidden donations. The time Victor called Finland ""just cold IKEA."" The Reddit thread he ran had 200k followers. Langston had no idea who was behind it.



And Nathan had no idea that Sophie Langston... was Victor’s daughter.



Until one sunny Sunday afternoon, when Sophie sipped her iced tea and casually said:



 “So... I was thinking. You should meet my dad.”

  
  


Nathan almost swallowed a lemon slice, whole.



“Meet... your dad?”

  
  


 “Yeah. He’s intense, but he’ll love you. You’re smart and... not intimidated by rich people.”

  
  


 “Uh-huh,” Nathan said, voice cracking slightly.

  
  


 “He’s home next weekend. I’ll make dinner. It’ll be fun.”

  
  


Nathan smiled the smile of a man who just realized he’s dating the daughter of his mortal enemy.

  


\---



One Week Later: The Langston Estate



Sophie beamed as she pulled open the heavy oak door to her father’s mansion.



 “Dad! This is Nathan! Nathan, my dad!”

  
  


Victor Langston, fresh off a business call, still had his cufflinks in and a glass of bourbon in one hand. He turned, smiled—and froze.



Nathan froze, too.



They both stared.



Nathan’s eyes screamed: Oh no, it’s the devil in tailored wool.



Victor’s eyes screamed: YOU?! The jackass who started the LangstonLeaks subreddit?!



But out loud, they both said—at the exact same time:



“...Pleasure to meet you.”



Sophie blinked.



 “You two know each other?”

  
  


Nathan let out a weird little cough-laugh hybrid.



 “N-nope! Just, you know, read some of his books. ‘Risk is a Currency’ was... extremely... published.”

  
  


Victor’s smile was pure corporate death.



 “Ah, you’re a reader. And a startup founder, was it? What was it again—‘LeafLoop’?”

  
  


Nathan nodded, trying not to sweat through his linen button-up.



 “We’re all about ethical disruption through vertical community empowerment.”

  
  


Victor’s eyes narrowed just slightly.



 “Sounds... expensive.”

  
  


 “Not as expensive as bailing out a luxury real estate deal in Jakarta after someone leaked the zoning violations.”

  
  


Sophie laughed, oblivious.



 “You guys talk like the same person! Isn’t that funny?”

  
  


Nathan and Victor both fake-laughed, dead inside.

  


\---



Later at Dinner



Sophie:



 “I’ve never had two men I love get along so well!”

  
  


Victor: Chokes on wine



Nathan: Chokes on water



Victor (recovering):



 “So, Nathan, how do you feel about... wealth redistribution?”

  
  


Nathan (gritting his teeth):



 “Love it. I redistribute my own paycheck to rent every month.”

  
  


Sophie:



 “Dad’s such a softie. You’d never believe he’s a shark in the boardroom!”

  
  


Victor:



 “Oh, I’m still a shark. Just... not when my daughter’s in the boat.”

  
  


Nathan:



 “I think I need more wine.”

  
  


Victor:



 “I think I need a background check.”

  
  
  


\---



After Dinner (Sophie Leaves the Room)



Nathan and Victor both drop their smiles instantly.



Victor (coldly):



 “If you hurt her, I will financially erase your existence.”

  
  


Nathan:



 “If you mess with me, I’ll publish that photo of you with Elon and the goat.”

  
  


Victor:



 “You wouldn’t dare.”

  
  


Nathan:



 “Try me.”

  
  


Victor: (sighs)



 “...Do you love her?”

  
  


Nathan: (quietly)



 “Yeah. I really do.”

  
  


Victor stares at him for a long, long moment. Then—reluctantly—nods.



Victor:



 “Then we lie.”

  
  


Nathan:



 “Agreed.”

  
  


Sophie walks back in, holding dessert.



Sophie:



 “What are you two whispering about?”

  
  


Both men in unison, far too fast:

“Politics.”

I'm doing okay on the build--just slow, since they're all new skills. But I'd love to maybe get coffee with some of you, see your vans, offer my skills if I have one you need, But I mostly just need support... and maybe a little validation.","About me: I'm a middle-aged woman coming into this with zero required skills, though YouTube has educated me better than i could have hoped! Now I can hook up 12v systems, install windows, all sorts of things, and learning more every day. I'm three months into the build and plan to be done by September 30. My van is a high roof cargo van.  
  
But it's so LONELY!!! i like living alone, but I sure would like someone to chat with in person about our vans, regardless of the build progress. I sometimes wish I had an extra set of hands, or even just someone to chat with while I build. Encouragement--that's what I need as well. (FYI I'm not just needy--I would love to support other builders as well!)

I think I feel so isolated because my mother clearly thinks I'm having some sort of menopausal midlife breakdown. The adult daughter who lives with me has zero interest--she's got her own life and thinks I'm too old to do something like this (because 53 is 93 to Gen Z LOL). My few close friends are all married and have full-time jobs, so I never really feel like I can ask them to ditch their husbands or come over on a rare day off to help. And for the past few months, a hard-core homophobe/racist/GET OFF MY GRASS new neighbor has been making life hell whenever I'm outside working, so I find myself just not going out there for several days at a time.

I think I'd just like to show my work-in-progress van to someone who understands why it still doesn't look impressive! Or who won't say, ""Hmm, what have you been doing for the past three months???""

And most importantly, just meet a few people who live and/or travel in their vans. I've seen thousands on YT and Reddit, but I'm starting to feel that actually meeting up with some people doing what I'm doing would validate this crazy thing I'm building!

Sooooo....Anyone in the area interested? We could meet up for coffee or lunch or whatever, or even just pull our vans into a parking lot and chat. ",2,1750756527.0,Boise,1,1.0,False

I have a question that's relevant to a research project I'm working on, relating to indirect communication. It seems that at least in hetero dating it's quite common to use euphemisms to propose sex/intimacy (like 'Would you like to come in for coffee?') I'm wondering whether this is also common in non-hetero dating scenarios? Have people noticed any differences between hetero and non-hetero dating/flirting with regard to how common it is to propose sex/intimacy directly and explicitly?",3,1750756414.0,AskLGBT,1,1.0,False
1lj6c08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lj6c08,Motorcycles for mental health [OC],"Last few weeks have been very heavy personally. Every man reaches a stage once in life where he feels it’s better to be silent and values peace. Took my bike for a ride just to go grab a coffee but did not stop anywhere, kept riding - no plans, no destination, just eyes on the road, enjoying the lovely breeze with the sound of the engine soothing all the anxiety and the seething, silent rage within. 


Before I realised I reached a secluded spot close to 90 kms from home. Saw a huge water body from distance and started riding along the running road, where I took a random leap of faith and chased a tiny forest trail that last 2.5 kms only to land at a vast open patch of greenery with no single soul in sight. Sat there all by myself for half hour before my ride back home. Smiled on the way back and felt grateful for the things I have in my life. Realised the importance of what a motorcycle or anything you’re passionate about can do to you, especially men in their 40s. Maybe I should do more solo trips in the future :)

Prepositioned one of the cars at Inveroran and went back to our accommodation for breakfast.

Loved getting past the railway bridge just outside Tyndrum - for the first time we could see the path for a long way ahead. Until we got 20 minutes of drizzle.

We could see but not really recognise Beinn Dorain as it was clagged in at the top.

Got to the Bridge of Orchy hotel at 1040 - twenty minutes before the bar opened. The barman took our orders and we waited on the back verandah. 

Managed to convince them to make us a couple of Aussie style Egg and Bacon rolls (freid egg, hot bacon, a little onion and a slice of cheese).

Got our beers (about 10 mins early). Just as we finished, the barman came out with two more (accidental incorrect pours apparently). It pays to be nice to service staff.

A lovely jaunt up ‘the esses’ and a short break at the cairn on the peak. Got chatting with a large group of young Germans and Swiss doing it the hard way (carrying all their stuff for the walk and a longer stay).

Down into Inveroran. Chocolate from the shop and into the pub. I got another beer, but my mate was driving, so it was coffee and cake for him.

The third pub? I hear you ask. Tyndrum Inn, when we returned to our accommodation our wives were MIA (they had gone back to Oban). So what do two tired Aussies do when they have time to kill? Hit the nearest pub of course.

16th,17th,18th,19th- feeling great, optimistic, finding my work from home jobs easier. Getting things completed. I am not finding parts of my
Job daunting any longer. I’m just getting them done! Definitely having a peak of motivation in all aspects. Cleaning house, exercise at the beach. 
I notice a drop around 6ish? Feeling very very tired. No energy to think about dinner for me and my partner but force myself to!
Lack of appetite for sure. Very dry mouth but all managed by sipping water all day.
Only bad side affect is my jaw aches quite badly (I grind and clench as it is so I was pretty bummed about this)- this calmed down maybe after the 4 days mark? 
Sleeping was disrupted for the first two nights now I’m sleeping great because I feel exhausted!
Getting up in the morning is a lot easier! I seem to wake up not as zombified 

This is best and most motivated I have felt in years for one stretch of time.

20th,21,22nd- I notice a big decline in my mental health. I’m feeling very tired, lack of appetite still, I had snapped at my partner a couple of times (I apologised bless him)

Saturday I was at a baby shower. Absolute no motivation to be there, talking was a chore. Feeling so so tired. I left early. It was the hottest day of the year and I forgot to drink enough for these 3 days. I think this must have something to do with it.
I eat a whole packet of waffles instead of dinner.
Tried to be intimate with partner- feeling empty and struggled to enjoy :( I was too focused on my uncomfortable dry mouth and just wasn’t much ‘feeling down there’

23rd- first day of 50mg
Feeling slightly more productive. Remembering to drink and making sure I do! I think dehydration is a definite no no.
Work is getting to me a little more than it did. A couple of very mildly opinionated customers making me cry at the end of the day. Obviously feeling emotional and anxious. Tired and not feeling enjoyment. I sat in one spot all day whilst worked. Didn’t leave house. (Not a good day)

Today- mental health is feeling better. I’m not feeling as low. Did get up later than I would have liked. Peeled myself out of bed for the first time since taking the medication (getting out of bed is one of my weak points) 
Managed to clean house, force down breakfast, decaf coffee and now sitting in one spot writing this! I’m going to try and be more active today as I feel like once I sit in one spot it’s very easy for me not to move… going to try and snap out of it. 
Jaw ache is slightly there but not as bad as it was.

Final comments-
I loved loved loved how I felt at the start. Big dip after a week and now I have my fingers crossed I can get back to a good place in the coming week. This is all new territory for me so I feel a little in the dark at what to expect next. ",3,1750756000.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

**Total - 19 KGs.** 

***Diet***  
Mostly regular Indian food with rotis, brown/white rice, chicken/mutton/fish curries, roasts and sautées. Also okra, eggplants, peas, beans, bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, etc. for veggies. Occasionally dal, paneer, beef tenderloins, goat brains/tripe/marrow, pork ribs/belly, duck and squids. 

When tired of meats and seafood, I eat scrambled eggs (4) cooked gooey soft in butter and 3 slices of whole wheat toast. Or eggs benedict with hollandaise and chilli oil. Boiled eggs for when too lazy.

Every Sunday (friday is shot day) is cheat day. I will visit a restaurant with family and eat naan, biryani, pizzas and/or a few other indulgent dishes including exotic desserts. I do this because I have always enjoyed eating food from all over the world and it will not change during or after MJ. Changes too drastic can lead to failure in weight maintenance post MJ. All cheat days have been checked off in calorie deficit.

***Workout***  
None explicitly. However, I play 3-4 hours of professional chess every day. I am rated 2100 and will often play a mix of blitz/rapid/bullet chess with IMs, GMs and the like. Chess does burn some calories.

Been fit and energetic even at HW. Will include strength training should I ever plateau my weight loss streak.

All side effects have vanished post 40 days on MJ. 

***NSVs (+ve & -ve)***  
Urge to shop emotionally (retail therapy) has dissappeared. I am saving lots of money over and above monthly SIPs, liquid contributions and expenses. I have always been an emotional shopper, not eater.

Unable to ride my bike or drive my car enough. Igniting enthusiasm towards weekly breakfast rides, afternoon coffee runs or overnight staycations has become dificult. This is because GLP1s influence happiness hormones in the brain.

***Additional Thoughts***   
I have long branded spring water to be elitist and have had it only delightfully in restaurants and airplanes. This June, I had it 'religiously' to meet my water intake and now I am a believer. What began by utter disdain towards aritificially flavoured hydration packets, ORS and water enhancers, has now become an undisputed part of my Mounjaro journey. I love the taste of Evian water. I am now 'excited' to drink 'water'. And... I'm pumped! (pun intended)

Last week was incredibly stressful. It was my wedding on Saturday so the build up was bad. I was b/p 2-3x a day, plus binging without purging (which I guess is a good thing? Not purging) 

I binge ate lettuce at one point because it was there and ready to just eat. So I sat and ate a whole tub of it. I stress ate a lot of a sweet things too

The day went well though and now we're off on a honeymoon. I feel like I'm eating so much but it's just eating. I had breakfast, lunch and dinner and coffees in-between. It was just regular eating but I'm still scared of the amount of calories I've taken in. Even though when I binge I probably easily put away 000's at once

I'm hoping though these few days will help ""reset"" my brain into a more normal eating pattern though because this whole binge/restrict cycle is not working and I'd like it to stop. I keep telling myself it's a holiday, you can treat yourself, have things you don't usually have. But the thought in the back of my head is ""you can get back to it after we're home""

I don't want to be sick anymore but I don't want to gain weight again. I want to be healthy. I'm at a healthy BMI, I think I'm pretty much right in the middle of the healthy weight range for my height.

The burning question consuming your pre-dawn brain: what time does Taco Bell open? Before you waste precious morning minutes driving to potentially locked doors, let's decode the mystery of Taco Bell's opening schedule.

The short answer? Most Taco Bell locations open at 7:00 AM daily, but ""most"" is carrying some serious weight here. Between breakfast-serving locations that open earlier, regional variations, and the occasional franchise owner who thinks 9:00 AM is ""early enough,"" knowing what time Taco Bell opens requires more insider knowledge than you'd expect.

# Standard Opening Hours: What Time Does Taco Bell Open?

# The 7 AM Standard

Most Taco Bell locations open at 7:00 AM sharp, seven days a week. This gives you a solid 19-hour window of operation since most close at 2:00 AM. Not bad for a chain that understands we don't all operate on society's conventional meal schedule.

But here's where it gets interesting – not every location follows this playbook. Some spots don't unlock their doors until 8:00 AM, others wait until 9:00 AM, and a select few breakfast-focused locations might open as early as 6:00 AM to catch the pre-work crowd.

# Breakfast Service Opening Times

Here's the key distinction: what time does Taco Bell open for breakfast service versus regular menu items? Locations that serve breakfast typically start their morning menu right when they open – so if they're unlocking doors at 7:00 AM, you can grab that Breakfast Crunchwrap immediately.

However, not all Taco Bell locations serve breakfast. About 500 out of 8,500 locations have dropped breakfast entirely, which means they might open later since they're not competing for the early morning crowd.

# Regional Variations: Location Determines Everything

# Urban vs. Suburban Opening Times

Metropolitan locations typically stick closer to the 7:00 AM standard opening time. Urban customers expect early service, and competition is fierce. Suburban locations might start later – 8:00 or 9:00 AM – especially if they're in residential areas where foot traffic doesn't pick up until later.

# College Town Considerations

University area locations often adjust their opening times based on academic calendars. During the school year, they might open at 7:00 AM to catch students before classes. During summer and winter breaks? Don't be surprised if they start later when campus is empty.

# Highway and Travel Centers

Airport and highway rest stop locations operate on completely different schedules. Some open as early as 5:00 AM to catch early flights and road trips, while others might not start until 8:00 AM if they're in low-traffic areas.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

# Weekend vs. Weekday Opening Hours

# Weekend Opening Patterns

Most Taco Bell locations maintain the same opening hours on weekends – 7:00 AM Saturday and Sunday. But some locations, particularly in areas with late-night weekend crowds, might push their opening time to 8:00 AM on weekends, figuring their customers aren't exactly early risers after Friday and Saturday nights.

# The Sunday Exception

Sunday mornings can be tricky. Some locations open later on Sundays – 8:00 or 9:00 AM – while others maintain regular hours. If you're wondering what time does Taco Bell open on Sunday specifically, it's worth checking your local location's schedule.

# How to Verify Opening Times: Don't Guess

# Official Store Locator

Taco Bell's website store locator is your most reliable source for answering ""what time does Taco Bell open"" for your specific location. It shows exact opening hours, holiday schedules, and any temporary changes to operating times.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

# Google Maps Integration

Google Maps pulls opening hours directly from Taco Bell's system and often includes additional context like ""opens earlier than usual"" or temporary hour changes. Pro tip: Google also shows if there are any reported issues with hours from recent visitors.

# The Mobile App Method

The Taco Bell app won't let you place orders for pickup outside of operating hours, so it serves as a real-time verification tool. If you can schedule an order for 7:00 AM pickup, they're opening at 7:00 AM.

# Holiday Opening Schedules

# Modified Holiday Hours

Holiday schedules can throw a wrench into your morning routine. Here's what to expect for major holidays:

|Holiday|Opening Status|Typical Opening Time|
|:-|:-|:-|
|New Year's Day|Usually open|Often delayed 1-2 hours|
|Easter Sunday|Most locations open|Regular hours|
|Memorial Day|Generally open|Standard 7:00 AM|
|4th of July|Usually open|Regular schedule|
|Labor Day|Typically open|Normal hours|
|Thanksgiving|Most locations closed|N/A|
|Christmas Eve|Open with modified hours|Often open later|
|Christmas Day|Almost all closed|N/A|

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

# Holiday Hour Verification

Never assume holiday hours. Even if Taco Bell typically opens at 7:00 AM, holidays can push that back to 9:00 AM or later. Always check the store locator or call ahead on holiday mornings.

# The Breakfast Factor: Earlier Opening for Morning Menus

# Breakfast-Serving Locations

Locations that serve breakfast often open right at 7:00 AM to maximize their breakfast window, which typically ends at 11:00 AM. These spots understand that breakfast customers are often on tight schedules and need early access.

# Non-Breakfast Locations

Locations that don't serve breakfast might not see the point in opening before 8:00 or 9:00 AM. Without morning menu items to sell, they're not competing for the early bird crowd.

# Finding Breakfast Locations

Use Taco Bell's breakfast location finder to identify which spots near you serve morning menus. This tool helps answer both ""what time does Taco Bell open"" and ""where can I get breakfast"" simultaneously.

# Early Morning Strategy: Timing Your Visit

# Peak Morning Hours

The busiest early morning times are typically:

* **7:00-8:00 AM**: Pre-work breakfast rush
* **8:00-9:00 AM**: School drop-off crowd
* **9:00-10:00 AM**: Mid-morning break seekers

# Optimal Visit Windows

For faster service and full menu availability, aim for:

* **Right at opening**: 7:00 AM sharp for minimal wait
* **9:30-10:30 AM**: Between breakfast and lunch rushes

# Comparison with Competitors

How does Taco Bell's opening time compare to other fast food breakfast options?

|Chain|Typical Opening Time|Breakfast End Time|Advantage|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Taco Bell|7:00 AM|11:00 AM|Latest breakfast cutoff|
|McDonald's|5:00-6:00 AM|10:30 AM|Earliest opening|
|Burger King|6:00 AM|10:30 AM|Consistent hours|
|Wendy's|6:30 AM|10:30 AM|Reliable breakfast|
|Sonic|Varies|All day|All-day breakfast|

Taco Bell's 7:00 AM opening isn't the earliest, but their 11:00 AM breakfast cutoff gives you more flexibility than most competitors.

# Unexpected Opening Delays: When Plans Go Sideways

# Common Delay Reasons

Sometimes Taco Bell opens later than posted hours due to:

* **Staffing shortages**: Can't open safely without adequate crew
* **Equipment issues**: Broken fryers or POS systems delay opening
* **Delivery delays**: Missing ingredients push back opening
* **Weather conditions**: Severe weather affects staffing and deliveries
* **Maintenance issues**: Overnight repairs running long

# Signs of Delayed Opening

* Parking lot lights still off at opening time
* No staff visible inside
* Drive-thru menu boards not illuminated
* Mobile app showing location as ""temporarily unavailable""

# Mobile Ordering: Your Opening Time Advantage

# Pre-Ordering Strategy

The Taco Bell app lets you place orders for future pickup times. If you know your local spot opens at 7:00 AM, you can place your order the night before for 7:15 AM pickup, ensuring you're first in line without the wait.

# App Benefits for Early Birds

* Skip the morning line entirely
* Guarantee menu item availability
* Earn rewards points on early orders
* Get push notifications about location status

# Regional Opening Time Patterns

# East Coast vs. West Coast

East Coast locations often open earlier to accommodate earlier work schedules and commuter patterns. West Coast locations might start later, aligning with different regional lifestyle patterns.

# Small Town vs. Big City

Small town locations often open later (8:00 or 9:00 AM) due to different customer patterns and staffing considerations. Big city locations typically stick closer to 7:00 AM to compete with other breakfast options.

# The 24-Hour Question: Always-Open Locations

A limited number of Taco Bell locations operate 24 hours, which technically means they never close or open – they're just always available. These locations are typically in major metropolitan areas, near hospitals, or at highway travel centers.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

Even 24-hour locations might have different service levels overnight. The full menu might not be available at 4:00 AM, but basic items usually are.

# Seasonal Hour Adjustments

# Summer vs. Winter

Some locations adjust opening times seasonally:

* **Summer**: Earlier opening in tourist areas
* **Winter**: Later opening in college towns when students are away
* **Holiday seasons**: Modified schedules from mid-December through early January

# Tourist Area Considerations

Locations in vacation destinations might open earlier during peak seasons to catch early-rising tourists and families, then revert to later opening times during off-seasons.

# Technology and Real-Time Updates

# Social Media Monitoring

Many individual Taco Bell locations post opening updates on their local social media pages. Follow your local spots for real-time information about delayed openings or hour changes.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

# Third-Party Integration

Food delivery apps often have the most current information about restaurant opening times since they integrate directly with point-of-sale systems. If DoorDash shows a location as available for immediate pickup, they're open.

# The Bottom Line: Mastering Taco Bell Opening Times

What time does Taco Bell open? The standard answer is 7:00 AM daily, but success requires understanding the variables – location differences, breakfast service availability, and the possibility of unexpected delays.

Your winning strategy: use the official store locator to verify your specific location's hours, consider mobile ordering for guaranteed early service, and have backup locations identified in case your primary spot opens later or experiences delays.

Master these verification methods and timing strategies, and you'll never again wonder ""what time does Taco Bell open"" while sitting in an empty parking lot at 6:45 AM. Because morning cravings wait for no one, and the early bird definitely gets the Crunchwrap.

*Ready to dominate your morning routine? Check your local Taco Bell's exact opening hours, download the app for pre-ordering, and never let delayed openings derail your breakfast plans again. Your mornings deserve better than disappointment.*",1,1750754731.0,RewardVault,0,1.0,False

Hubby and I are 5 years married and 10 years together – for 10 years constant ang communication, walang araw na hindi kami nag usap kahit may tampuhan o misunderstanding kami.

Before I share anything – I love him with all my heart, sabi nya even when I’m asleep, I tell him na love ko sya. He surely is my safe space.

Kahit nasa work kami, magkachat kami – update, kwento, kamustahan, more update. Minsan nagvvidcall pa. Sobrang thankful ako at naappreciate ko yung communication namin despite the years of being together.

Pero lately, naffeel ko na I need a break from it, or maybe a space from it. I don’t have problems with us updating each other pero yung energy ko lately hindi na kaya makipagchat maghapon kasi other than that, I have work to do, at the same time, I wanted to eat my lunch at peace (yung silent lang while reading a book or watching something without disruption), pauwi naman, I’d rather nap during my 2-2.5 hours travel. Naisip ko, we could talk about how our day went kapag time na naming dalawa for bed rather than scrolling thru soc med.

Another thing, he works on Saturdays while ako is naka-off – we have a toddler and a cat to tend (the tasks look easy but repetitively doing it is overwhelming), I had to do the laundry, ironing, change cat litter, cook lunch and all so that pag Sunday, hayahay kami at makapahinga rin sya since one day off nga lang sya per week. Maghapon yan ng Sabado, he likes to video call – I understand, he wants to assure that we are okay and doing well, nung una okay pa but lately, it’s frustrating and annoying na, kasi imbis na focus sa chores at bata, iintindihin ko pa na kausapin sya. Minsan, I asked him if he could take our child somewhere like park or mall for an hour or two just for me to do general cleaning kaso 20 minutes pa lang tumatawag na kung pwede na ba sila umuwi.

I want to share too that I am introverted and since I know naman na hindi na possible yung constant alone time since may family na but sometimes I really need that to breathe. Pag Friday, maaga uwian ko and sometimes I plan to just sit somewhere and sip coffee or eat something nice kahit 1 hour lang before ako umuwi pero pag sinabi ko ng ganun plan ko, he would ask if ok lang na Samahan nya ako. Kahit sa labag sa loob, I say yes to avoid tampuhan.

Now I feel a subtle built of resentment not towards him but towards the actions and sa bagay na hindi ko masabi. How can I say these things na hindi nya mamasamain o pagtatampuhan? I appreciate so much that he looks after me/us consistently and diligently pero minsan I need my space.",0,1750754396.0,CasualPH,2,0.5,False

I am a huge listener and love your podcast, which I listen to at my desk at work. So hello from Scotland, and I wanted your opinion on this because I don’t know what to do.

I (25F) recently broke up with my partner (27NB). 

For a bit of background, we met at university, and within a few weeks of dating, they told me they were non-binary. I am straight, but was completely fine with their identity as they were presenting as male at the time and were still figuring things out. 

Fast forward to now, we spent seven and a half years together, and over that time, my partner, I will call them G, had increasingly questioned their identity, specifically if they may be a transgender woman. I’m not going to lie, this has been extremely hard for me, particularly in the last few years, because I love them, I still do. They are the sweetest, silliest, most thoughtful person I know and I spent many hours in therapy teaching myself how to more openly communicate so we could preserve the love that we had, and so I could support them in discovering this side of themself. They now openly wear more feminine clothing most of the time, occasionally enjoy a bit of makeup, like painting their nails, and all these things have made them more happy over the years, which I think has been great for them mentally.

However, within the last year, I have been increasingly haunted by questioning thoughts of whether they were truly the kind of person I wanted to date. 

For context, I am a massive fan of fantasy romance books, and the sort of people who interest me in those are extremely masculine, strong jawlines, lean physique, deep sexy voice, all that sort of thing.

On top of that, G’s been growing increasingly interested in beginning Gender-Affirming Hormones, essentially commencing physical transition into a woman. 

I understood why they wish to take this step, and I was fairly certain I knew where this was going, but I was too afraid to step away, as we had a house, a cat and were in a good place. 

Then, a few weeks ago, G told me they wished to begin using she/her pronouns, and I knew in that moment I could not keep being in a relationship if they so publicly presented themself as feminine. So we ended it, both mutual, and it really sucks.

Now, I move to the crux of the issue. 

Within a few days of us splitting up, I decided to get back on tinder. 

I had been feeling really low, and afraid I would be lonely, so I was curious to see if the dating scene had changed since I was last single. G knew I was doing this, and supported me in discovering new people as they understood that I wished to find out what I truly wanted in a relationship, apart from them. However, we had not yet sorted out the bed situation, and I was still sleeping in the same room as them.

I matched with a nice guy that same day, A (27M), and he invited me out on for coffee, which, being the curious person I was, I said yes to. He had beautiful brown hair, kind eyes, and was extremely sweet about wishing to meet me.

I told G about this, as I was worried that I would push my limits too much, that it was too early and could make them feel worse, but to my surprise, they smiled and told me they were happy for me to go, and I deserved it. So I did.

I won’t lie, the date went great! We talked for a good few hours (he knew what had happened with G and was v respectful of it). He then took me to a park for a walk, my arm in his, we sat in the grass and chatted while he played with my hair and at the end of the date, i let him kissed me, though i was terrified it wouldn’t feel as nice as with G. Spoiler alert: i was wrong, it was wonderful. I left feeling more beautiful and sexy than I had done in months, and excited to see where this would go, so I told my friend, R (27F) as I thought she would be happy for me.

For background on R, she is a friend that I met through G, and has been close to both of us for our entire relationship. She also just recently got out of a terrible situation with an emotionally abusive ex, who brought her self esteem down terribly. Not relevant to the story, but I thought it would give some idea of what kind of person she is.

To my surprise, she told me that I was arsehole, saying I should not be going out on a date, and then coming back to cuddle with G at the end of the night. I will reiterate that both G and A knew everything that was going on, and said they were fine with it.

However, her advice did hit home, I have now moved into the spare room. I messaged R to update, thanking her for giving me the push I needed because I know she was right, and it was for the best that we make some boundaries, but she still refuses to meet me. She’s saying she needs some time to figure out how to talk about this without us hurting each other. I feel like crap cause she is one of my best friends. We have been able to talk about anything and everything, and I don’t want to go through this change in my life without her. 

I have another date today, but it feels somewhat soured after this discussion with R. So I suppose, dear Reddit, dear Morgan and co, what I am asking is…

I quickly noticed that I felt much, much better each day when I drink this much decaf coffee. I don't add any sugar, I just get low acid coffee and add milk

I'm thinking it has to be all the antioxidants? I try to get a lot of antioxidants already in my diet but the difference is night and day for me with coffee",2,1750753588.0,UlcerativeColitis,2,1.0,False

I am currently trying to play through Abel's route. I have spoken to him upstairs with Celia and the water spill, I took his side as much as I could and got him dried off. I spoke to him in the bedroom with the initial Ben-hwa and then the lube incident and got him cleaned up. I was able to get both collectibles for the spills. I also got the coffee collectible from Kopi. I spoke to him in the dining room,Tony fixed him up, and I talked him down from the interaction- but I got no collectable for that. I've even talked gotten the Desperate Houseknives talk! Now, I speak with him and he is just says that he has work to do and runs off.  

I've done the dining table, coffee table, bedside table, and key table. Things are ""all good"" in the foyer, living room and kitchen. The only strange thing I've done is encourage him to talk to Dasha at one of our earliest interactions, but I've romanced her already and he doesn't bring her up. I've also seen that he is supposed to mention Jacques but I haven't seen that dialogue at all. I'm unsure if this is a bug, soft lock, or what.

I just want my beautiful thick cowboy to love me back!  ",2,1750753509.0,DateEverything,1,1.0,False

Im saving for a coffee shop right now, currently at $1200 out of $30000. And my employees have been working so hard for me for the coffee cart and was wondering if i should buy them a lunch as an appreciative gesture! It would cut some money from our saved part but i feel like they deserve it. 

But i dont want to cut money from our save jar because i really want a coffee shop. Any help or ideas would be great thanks!",3,1750753099.0,smallbusiness,16,0.71,False
1lj5ilu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lj5ilu/feeling_shocked_and_confused_after_i_22m_saw_my/,Feeling shocked and confused after I (22M) saw my girlfriend (21F) without makeup. How do I navigate?,"My girlfriend and I have been officially dating for less than a week, but we’ve been seeing each other for about two months. Things have been really good and we’ve gone on nice dates, we’re taking things slow physically (no sex yet), and we’ve just been getting to know each other.

One thing I never really noticed until recently was how much makeup she wears. Or maybe she’s just very good at applying it and I genuinely couldn’t tell. Her makeup always looked really natural, so I never gave it much thought. If I really paid attention, I might’ve seen a little skin texture, but nothing that stood out.

The other night, we were at a party and both of us got tipsy. We ended up in a bedroom, the lights were off, and we started making out pretty heavily. It was hot, sweaty, and her face was kind of smushed against my chest. I wasn’t wearing a shirt. We eventually fell asleep like that.

I woke up before she did, and that’s when I noticed. Most of her makeup had rubbed off during the night, and I saw her bare skin for the first time. She had really inflamed, red areas on her cheeks and chin, breakouts on her forehead. It looked painful, like cystic acne. It shocked me because she looked so different from what I was used to.

It was one of those moments where part of me if I’m being brutally honest felt kind of deceived. Which is harsh I know. It was more shock than actual twinge of feeling turned off by how she looked. But it really did feel like I was seeing a completely different person. I started wondering if she thought I was too clueless to ever notice, or if she just hoped I wouldn’t care.

When she woke up, I think she realized what happened. She looked embarrassed and went straight to the bathroom and stayed there for a while. I told her it was okay, that she didn’t have to hide, and that her skin didn’t matter to me. I said what I thought was the decent thing to say. But now, I’m questioning if I actually meant it deep down. Because truthfully, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about how different she looked.

I haven’t ghosted her or anything, but I’ve definitely been keeping busy. I don’t know what to say to her. She’s picked up on it and is clearly anxious over text, but I still don’t know how to respond without either lying or hurting her feelings.

The whole thing’s made me wonder if I rushed into this too quickly. She wanted some commitment and I liked her enough to do that. Maybe I should have pushed back gently and we should’ve spent more time dating casually getting to know each other fully before getting official. I didn’t expect to feel this way, but now that I do, I don’t know what the right next step is.

I know some people might read this and instantly call me shallow. I’ve already run that accusation through my own head. But here’s where I’m genuinely trying to understand the line. 

To me there’s a difference between someone wanting to look their best, to feel confident and put-together, and someone consistently presenting a version of themselves that’s so curated it creates a false baseline of what they actually look like. That distinction matters. Recalling some memories I can tell now she wore full face makeup even for a casual coffee run. 

I’ve dated someone with skin issue before, but it didn’t change how attracted I was to her. 

I fully understand that she doesn’t owe me full vulnerability, especially not early on. But do I need to agree with the idea that her use of so much makeup was also about presenting a “curated/false” version of herself and not just wanting to look her “best”? What if her idea of makeup is really to change her whole face?

I’m not claiming to be the victim here. But I also can’t say she’s entirely without responsibility in all this. She knew her natural skin might significantly affect how I saw her, and yet she allowed me to think this is what she looked like so I am also a little miffed with her.

I don't know if I want to break up with her. She's a good person but if I continue dating her I'd want to force an honest conversation with her. ",0,1750753076.0,relationship_advice,25,0.18,False

Last week we tried the tracked remote mower from InfiniteAgTech on our steepest row (measured 38° with the phone inclinometer).
• Vegetation: knee-high fescue, blackberry, and poplar saplings ≤ 2 cm
• Time on site: 52 min (battery still at 60 %)
• Operator fatigue: zero—stood on the terrace wall with a coffee
The tracks never slipped on the shale, and the dual blades mulched fine enough that raking was unnecessary. When it finished, the slope looked manicured instead of conquered.”*

There is also crusting on the back of his ears but keeping at bay with the wipes. He's had a couple lesions/cuts on his forehead area that went away quickly with ointment. I took him to the vet two months ago and they checked his ear said just some yeast gave ear drops. Symptoms kept going so took him back a month later they did the ear crytology again and didn't find anything. I see brown specks in his ear canal and inner ear area often, as well as the base. He also has had hair thinning on and around his ears. In the flaps of his ears he had black and brown specks and marks, I know black coffee grounds indicate ear mites but it was only in the flaps of his ears and only several not a bajillion. I had him on a hydrocortisone/microsilver regimen from amazon for a 10 day course, went back on still no success now just using homeopathic ear wipes and today got a bottle of medicated ear flush at a health pet store. I'm considering taking him to a dermatologist since this ear itching has gone on over a couple month now. Regular vet said to do hydrolyzed protein diet to discover food allergies.

I am considering going to a different vet or a dermatologist but the specialist is way more pricey.",1,1750752846.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False
