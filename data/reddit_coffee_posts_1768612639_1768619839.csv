# 🗞️ WHY IS THIS NOT FEBRUARY 

Let’s address the acorn in the room.

A calm, civilized decision was made by the Squirrel Editorial Board to publish **once a month**. One issue. Plenty of time to chew, digest, and recover. February was locked in. Calendars were circled. Tails were relaxed.

Then suddenly… Copycat “news agencies” began crawling out of the woodwork.

Breaking alerts every five minutes. Articles riddled with typos. Zero jokes. Maximum AI vibes. Headlines that said nothing. Paragraphs that felt like they were written by a confused raccoon stepping on a keyboard

Reader burnout was imminent. So the squirrels did what squirrels do in a crisis:  
they screamed, spilled coffee, knocked over filing cabinets, and sprinted back into the newsroom.

This is a **Breaking News Edition** not because we wanted clout, but because someone had to save journalism.

# 🐋 AX REALLY IS A WHALE WHISPERER 🐋

For seasons, Ax carried a title that most people treated like satire.

“Whale Whisperer?”  
“Sure buddy.”  
“ZOO recruiting strong players? I’ve heard this bedtime story.”

Well. Wake up. Ax just recruited Puzz

Yes. *That* Puzz. Former Animal Control. PvP boogeyman. Spreadsheet demon. The guy rumored to be personally funding half of PvP like a one man stimulus package.

For seasons, Puzz appeared permanently enchanted by RUN. Bound by loyalty. Or blackmail. Or a very strong friendship bracelet. Scholars debated it.

Whatever spell RUN had on him?

**Broken. Shattered. Dispelled. Deleted from the patch notes.**

Puzz has joined RIP, they jumped straight into PvP homeworld, and immediately began treating it like a bonfire at a summer camp for alliances that made poor life choices.

Tiles are burning. Morale is evaporating. The map is now mostly fire and regret.

Ax didn’t just whisper to a whale. He summoned one. With receipts.

# 🔥 RIP + PUZZ = PROBLEM 🔥

Together, RIP and Puzz are currently doing what can only be described as *educational violence*. Clean marches. Ruthless timing. Zero mercy. Maximum confidence.

This isn’t a raid. This is a live demonstratio

# 🤔 EVERYONE IS NOW VERY NERVOUS 🤔

So the forest asks:

Who actually stops RIP now?  
Does NOT remain loyal to RUN, or are they circling like the vultures they are waiting for PvP to fracture before scooping up survivors?  
Is this the start of a power shift… or just the opening scene before everything gets worse?

No one knows. Anyone pretending they do probably already published three “breaking alerts” about it with the wrong alliance tags

# 🐿️ FINAL NOTES FROM THE NEWSROOM 🐿️

This story is ongoing.  
The squirrels are watching.  
Binoculars polished. Nuts stocked. Slack notifications muted.

If this escalates further, we’ll be back with another update.

And to the copycat news agencies:  
Please take a nap. Or a spelling class. Or both

Pretty much toxic relationship. On and off.

Here spoiler:

>!Pheeracha (Neen), a wealthy heiress, and Ranchanlapas (Ran), a calm lawyer, enter a severe marital crisis mainly caused by Ran’s mother, Kingkamon. Kingkamon constantly insults Neen—her class, manners, clothes, and background—and Ran rarely defends her, making Neen feel unprotected and unloved. This long-term tension pushes Ran to propose divorce, leaving both women emotionally wounded and confused. They still love each other but become trapped in a cycle of anger, silence, hurt, and pride.!<

>!Ran is gossiped about at work as “living off her rich wife,” causing deep shame and loss of self-worth. Neen overhears these rumors, realizes Ran suffered alone, and breaks down. Kingkamon escalates her hostility, even trying to replace Neen with another woman (Melinya). Frequent arguments, jealousy, and miscommunication cause toxic emotional swings - sometimes coldness, sometimes intense affection and intimacy that temporarily softens the distance. Friends and family witness the deterioration but struggle to help.!<

>!The conflict reaches a breaking point when Kingkamon publicly assaults Neen. Ran finally chooses to stand up to her mother and cuts ties—but the damage has already accumulated. Both families pressure the couple in different ways, and Neen, emotionally exhausted, initiates the divorce, feeling she cannot endure the pain anymore despite still loving Ran. Ran accepts because she believes she failed to protect or support her wife. They separate for two years, each woman grieving privately.!<

>!By chance, Neen and Ran reunite after two years. They confess they never stopped loving each other and begin again - slowly, carefully. Ran returns to France to finish her studies, and they maintain a healthier long-distance relationship. They reunite permanently, remarry quietly (no second ceremony), rebuild trust, and settle into a stable, loving life together.!<

XRP is a tool, not a treasure. It’s designed to move money quickly, cheaply, and with high liquidity.

If it were $1,000:

Extreme volatility: tiny movements would mean huge losses for banks.

Liquidity issues: banks moving large sums would push the price up instantly.

Wrong incentives: holders wouldn’t sell, less XRP circulating → less efficient system.



In other words, it would lose its purpose: it would stop flowing and become speculative, like using gold bars to buy a coffee.



Functional price range: 



double digits / low triple digits.

High enough to incentivize liquidity and prevent spam.

Low enough for fast rotation and low relative volatility.



Simple example:

Coin worth $10 → everyone uses it, system works.

Coin worth $1,000 → no one uses it, everyone hoards, system dies.",0,1768619181.0,XRPUnite,0,0.33,False

What can I compost?

 • Eggshells

 • Fruit and peelings

 • Grass clippings, leaves and weeds

 • Landscape prunings

 • Meat, bones, dairy and seafood (packaging removed)

 • Pasta, grains and bread

 • Paper plates, bowls and napkins (no plastic or compostable plastic)

 • Tea bags, coffee grounds and paper filters

 • Tree trunks and tree branches (maximum 4 inches in diameter by 2 feet long)

 • Vegetables and peelings

 • Cold wood ashes

What must stay out of my compost bin?

 • Animal/pet waste

 • Bamboo

 • Barbecue ashes

 • Cactus

 • Cooking oil and liquid waste

 • Dirt, rocks or sod

 • Glass

 • Manure (from chickens, cows, horses, etc.)

 • Palm fronds

 • Pampas grass

 • Plastics, including those labeled biodegradable or compostable

 • Poison oak

 • Sudden Oak Death-infested material

 • Tree stumps

\[/factbox\]

Current regional compost facilities aren’t able to process the materials in most compostable plastic bags, even if they’re certified as biodegradable, according to the website for Recology, the garbage hauler for the majority of Sonoma County.

Sonoma County has not had its own composting facility since 2015. Zero Waste Sonoma, the government agency that partners with the county and local cities to encourage residents reduce waste, partners with four Bay Area composting facilities, shipping the county’s compostable refuse to either the West Contra Costa Sanitary Landfill, Redwood Landfill in Marin County, Cold Creek Compost in Ukiah or Napa Garbage and Recycling.

“Local compost facilities are not unique in their stance of not accepting ‘biodegradable’ or ‘compostable” items, said Celia Furber, community relations and sustainability manager with Recology Sonoma Marin. “Most commercial compost facilities across the state do not accept these materials.”

Johnson added that because of inconsistencies in product labeling, the composting facilities cannot easily distinguish compostable products from conventional, or petroleum-based plastic products.

So, to avoid creating microplastics that would end up in the finished compost — much of it sold to organic farmers — the compost facility operators screen out anything that resembles plastic and then send those materials to the landfill.

The same holds true for backyard compost piles, which are too small and fail to reach high enough temperatures to properly break down the materials.

Both Johnson and Furber suggest placing kitchen scraps in a paper bag or swapping out the compostable bag with paper towels or newspaper.

“Paper products are accepted in curbside composting bins,” Furber said.

Furber also suggested keeping food scraps in a sealed bag or container in the freezer, then dumping the scraps in the compost cart periodically.

Carey, frustrated by what he calls disingenuous marketing by the composting bag companies, wonders why they’re even sold at grocery stores at all. He went to his local grocery store and told the manager they shouldn’t be selling the bags.

“I don’t like things like that happening,” he said of the mixed messaging. “I wanted the real information to get out there.”

Furber says such bags have taken over a greater share of the market especially in California, after grocery stores were forced to eliminate plastic checkout bags and seek alternatives in their place.

“People are understandably confused that green plastic bags with these labels are not accepted,” she said.",3,1768618865.0,sonomacounty,0,1.0,False

1qf1e25,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1qf1e25/i_just_got_off_an_ncl_cruisethe_differences_made/,I just got off an NCL cruise…the differences made me RCL a lot!,"When it comes to cruising, my family and I I generally stick to Royal Caribbean as our cruise line of choice.  However, there are certain destinations that RCL hasn’t made its way to just yet (or ever).  Our original plan was to take NCL on a South American/Antarctica cruise over Christmas and New Years.  Well back in Jan, we get word that the cruise was cancelled.  We didn’t see anything that was worthwhile to explore, so we opted for the Norwegian Joy during New Years.  Esp since it was heavily discounted.

Before going on NCL, many people who sailed in the past with NCL told us of past experiences: the food wasn’t that great, that the drink service was slow, and the internet sucks on board.  So I took those comments to heart and went into this cruise with kinda low expectations.

Pre-boarding:  the NCL app was rather difficult to use and not as straightforward as RCL.  Although I was able to check me and the kids in, I had issues with my wife.  We would keep refreshing and retrying to check her in but to no avail.  Finally, I logged onto the NCL website and looked at her profile…her gender was incorrect.  After switching it to female, then she was able to complete the check in process.  And we all got an 11:00 check in time which I thought was extremely lucky for the first time.  Point RCL.

Boarding:  we arrived exactly at 11:00 at the port.  And while we thought we were lucky to have an 11:00 boarding time, it seemed that almost everyone else had the same boarding time!  We waited at least 30 mins in a long line just to clear security.  Then when we made it to the check in line, that’s where we encountered the first cluster.  You see, there were two lines for passengers to check in: one going right and one going left.  The line going to the right were suppose to check in with counters 1-25 and the line going left was to use counters 26-50…or at least that’s how the setup looked.  When we reached the front of our line, the NCL employee at the front sent us to counter 22.  Well, at the same time, the other NCL employee handling the other line also sent a group to the same counter!  They reached it first and when we waited behind them, we were told to “get back in line,” by another NCL employee and “we couldn’t linger.”  We just kept walking until we found an open counter and we eventually made it to the handicap accessible counter where the lady there happily checked us in.  Then came waiting on another long and slow moving line to actually board the ship.  By now, it’s well past noon and the ship is starting to fell crowded.  Point RCL

Muster: As soon as we board, we were directed to our muster stations to check in.  That is probably my first good point for NCL so far.  In RCL, we’re suppose to go to our muster stations right away, but let’s be honest…we don’t.  Point NCL

Drink and Drink package:  Prior to boarding, I was shocked to read that NCL does not allow passengers to bring on soda or water packages onto the ship.  Since my wife and I had the More at Sea drink package, we didn’t see a issue at first esp since it seemed like the standard drink package we get with RCL.  However, we quickly realize that bottle water is NOT included in our drink package and we had to buy a case of water if we really wanted to have bottle water in our stateroom, so we purchased a 12 bottle package. Point RCL

As far as drink service goes, the speed of the getting served varied from bar to bar.  Sometimes I’d wait a minute or so, but other times I’d be waiting a long time.  Most bars only had one or two bartenders, and that included in the popular areas like the pool bar and Atrium (deck 6).  Point RCL

Drink quality wise, this is where it highly varied.  On Royal, I’m use to the bartenders make almost every drink fresh on the spot.  On NCL, most popular drinks were already pre-made.  Bahama Mama and Piña Colada were already premade and the taste varied per stationed.  In one bar, the Bahama Mama might be extremely strong and at another bar, it was a normal strength.  Point RCL.

What also caught our eye is we still had to pay the tax for each drink we order!  Now, I haven’t seen my receipt yet from the cruise ship, but I hope that was not true.

Now on the positive side of the drink package, you could get two drinks per order.  That was a huge relief knowing I can order my wife a drink without having to give her key card.  It also meant I can ask for a drink and a shot at the same time.  I didn’t do it often, but it was good to know.  Point NCL

For the kids (15 and 12), we originally did not get them the soda package because they don’t drink that much soda for it to be worth the cost.  However, when we were told that the Soda Package ($60 per passenger) also included mocktails, we bought our kids each a soda package.  And although they had a soda package, bottle water was still NOT included.  But for the price, Point NCL.

Buffet: Our first experience with the ship’s food was the Embarkation Day Buffet at the Garden Cafe.  Once again, we went in with low expectations, but that was quickly shattered.  The food being served in the buffet was delicious!  And NCL had so many varieties of food too.  My ultimate favorite food at the buffet was the Pho/Udon noodle station.  Then there was the carving station where it had a different protein every time we went: roasted pig leg, bbq brisket, Mexican Flank Steak, Italian Roasted Chicken, roasted pork ribs, etc.  Huge point to NCL!

Main Dining room:  NCL didn’t have a set dining as RCL does (if they didn’t, I didn’t figure it out).  So it was similar to My Time Dining.  On the Joy, there were three main dining rooms that we could go for dinner between 1730 and 2130.  We stuck to our usual 2000 dining time, but when we arrived at the dining room, we still had at least a 20-40 min wait for a table.  Again, this is probably similar to My Time Dining, so no points either way.

Dining room food:  NCL just recently made a change to their policy where if you want an additional main entrée, you are charged $6.  However, that’s just for the entrée.  For starters, you can still order as many as you would like.

Starters wise, they were good but small in portion size.  So for starters, Point goes to RCL.

Main entrées wise, the food was good!  With of course one exception…NCL’s version of a NY Steak.  It was def NOT a NY steak and more of a rump steak.  However, the point for taste def goes to NCL.

Now here’s what made me miss RCL a lot.  My daughter had a stomach issue and excused herself from the dinner table.  I told the server that I will take her main course and dessert to the room, so can I have a lid for both.  The server looked confused at the request and went to speak to her manager.  About a minute later, the server came back and said “sir, per health and safety reasons, you cannot take the food to your room.”  WHAT!?  “However, we cannot stop you either, so I will bring the food to the table, but I cannot give you a lid.”  That was the biggest difference to me by far on this cruise, but it wouldn’t be the last.

Late night food:  My experience for late night food has always been Sorrento’s pizza and cold cut sandwiches from the coffee shop.

The Joy…did not have a late night pizza joint.  Instead, it had a 24/7 eatery called The Local that made bar food to order (sandwiches, burgers, chicken wings, etc).  Which sounds good in theory, but then when I asked if I can take the food to go, the answer was a stern no!  If I wanted food in the room, I was told to order room service.

So all in all…I rate the cruise a 6/10.  NCL had some good points, but the things that they fell short on really made me miss Royal.  Luckily we don’t have to wait long for our next Royal cruise as we are boarding the Navigator OTS on Mar 9.",0,1768618562.0,royalcaribbean,0,0.33,False

I can’t take advice from people who aren’t teachers and we English teachers end up carrying a lot of grading with us. 

I have really bad ADHD so everything needs a home so I know where to look for it. It takes me forever to create a new habit. 

I take the subway to work and I grade papers on the train. My work laptop stays at work. Student work is on paper and I have 125 students. Each class is color coded and I leave graded papers that just need scores entered at school. I end up bringing all the food I eat in a day with me because I get hungry for breakfast after I arrive and if I need to stay later, I’m always grateful to have a meal with me. The glass containers add weight but they’re microwave safe and they don’t leak. 

I feel like I’m camping because I bring everything with me all the time. I’m constantly asking myself if I can lighten my load. 

This weekend I’ve dumped my bag and I’m repacking in cubes and categorizing everything. 

My categories:

1. Papers 

2. Food/ coffee/ water bottle (the most weight)

3. Wallet 

4. Keys. Damn do I have a lot of keys 

5. Gym clothes

6. Medicines

7. Journal/ kindle/ way too many pens to inhabit one bag. I stopped bringing books. I can live with one kindle and the zillion books that are there or on my phone. External charger. 

When I need to go to my kids’ events I always end up bringing everything (minus the food and gym clothes) and it feels too heavy. If I pack a separate bag, I always forget something.

1qf1dlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1qf1dlx/i_somehow_found_the_confidence_to_leave_my_dead/,I somehow found the confidence to leave my dead bedroom.,"Me (33F) and my ex (36F) were together for around 4 years when I made the decision 5 years ago to end it due to the lack of sex, and more so general intimacy. I missed the subtle hand holding watching TV, the morning cuddles and obviously sex. The biggest frustration was that it felt like she didn’t ever listen to my concerns or cared enough to actually put in effort.

Even though it broke me, I knew deep down was the right decision. I genuinely thought she was my soulmate and never thought I would find someone like her , which I believe was the reason I didn’t end it sooner. I’m a pretty confident person and quite self assured but I sort of cringe at some of that relationship- I really wish I had left sooner or not put up with the behaviour I had to. She made it seem like I was obsessed with sex when all I really wanted was some cuddles or some sort of physical intimacy.

I struggled for around 6 months after the breakup, however once I picked myself up I felt confidence like I hadn’t before. I committed to the gym getting in the best shape of my life, leaned on family and friends and was the happiest I’ve ever felt.

Around 9 months post break up, my now partner and I met when we both really weren’t looking for anyone. She is attentive, the intimacy has never once wavered and she is constantly checking in with me about how we can improve as a couple and asking how I am going. The sex is amazing but it’s also the little kisses in the kitchen while cooking dinner together, morning in bed with a cup of coffee and making me feel like the most important person in the world.

Just providing a bit of hope to you all that are in dead bedrooms like I once was and felt helpless- I feel like I found my person and I would never have met my current partner if I had stayed in my old relationship that was way beyond it’s expiry date.",6,1768618532.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

19 days ago, my fiancé and I returned home from the holidays, and found a bed bug nymph on a sticky trap. It was confirmed to be a bed bug nymph by pest control. It was in a strange location, actually on our stairs nowhere near any bedrooms or furniture. The pest control guy did a thorough inspection of the apartment, and found no signs of bed bugs, and suggested this is a hitchhiker given its strange location being stuck on a sticky trap, and literally no other signs in the apartment. 

My fiancé and I have torn apart every thing that could harbor bed bugs. The couch, the bed, everything, dresser, coffee table. We even fully unscrewed the bed and inspected every screw, screw hole, slats, all the leg posts, headboard, you name it, and found literally nothing. I have inspected most of our furniture with the same level of detail. We isolated the bed and couch from the walls to create “bed bug island”, and put interceptor traps on the bed, nightstand, and couch. We have sprayed crossfire per the instructions on the bottle (it is legal to purchase and use where we live), including vacuuming everything before spraying. All of our clothes are in airtight bins, and everything else has been making its way through the wash and dryer, and stored in airtight bags in an unused room. We are (I guess fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you view it), moving in 2 weeks. We are getting rid of all of our furniture except our couch and coffee table, and plan to treat the new apartment upon move in. We have dealt with infesting bugs in this apartment (carpet moths, carpet beetles), despite keeping a whistle clean home, which I know has nothing to do with bed bugs, but suffice it to say I am really at my wits end. 

I guess I’m partially writing this for support, and half for a potential bite ID. I woke up yesterday to these marks on the front/slightly toward the side of my neck. They don’t itch at all. I sleep on my side, and this part of my neck is slightly elevated from the bed. I also sleep with a necklace on, and the marks are about the same width as my necklace, which kind of rest slightly upward that what is pictured while I sleep. Could this be a sign of bed bugs?

I HAVE EXPERIENCE MIND YOU!!

Applied to this cafe like 10m by train, literal heaven. Great benefits, lovely team, I loved them and considering all the green flag ""how you know your interview went well"" it checked all the boxes. They seemed engaged, the interview was way longer than it was supposed to be, it was just GOOD. we connected, i thought to myself ""okay i really want this job, i think i'm a good candidate for it"". Everyone who i spoke to and recounted the interview to, said the same thing. Even my brutally honest no nonsense friends. Even a barista who works for the same chain cafe in a different location said I got it. Even though i was realistically tamping (pun intended) my expectations, i was hopeful.

I do the typical hospitality thing, they tell me when they'll follow up and if they dont, send a follow up email. I send one, grammar check it like 5 times for good measure and schedule send it for 8AM next day. Nothing. Then I wait a week. Typically the hiring process is mid to closing, so I send another one and schedule send for 8AM again. Again, nothing. No response, no acknowledgement at all. Not even one just to be polite.

I had a couple relationships afterwards but it didn’t lead anywhere. I don’t have any experiences to share with anyone I’m just living life by myself. Whenever I make friends they always leave or it stays very surface level. Recently I reached out to a friend group asking anyone if they wanted to grab coffee and nobody responded and 2 weeks later they said happy new year then finally replied sorry they were out of town.

I had a dream last night of the popular girls from my high school. One of them is a successful influencer IRL and now married to a hot guy and her bff is also successful too and they’re still best friends. I think it’s because I have been creeping on their Instagram and I always get jealous of that. Some of them still talk to their friends from high school too. I don’t know why I dreamt about them but I felt so excluded and below them and wish I had those experiences. I know there’s no changing the past but I just need to revise it in a way that makes me feel better where I can just let go and move on.",1,1768617569.0,lawofassumption,2,1.0,False

Right in time for laundry day. The new machines hare much taller and like everything it comes with an app; why everything has to be hooked up to my phone is beyond me but it is what it is. I was upstairs with cooper while they installed it but it seemed like a seamless setup and the guys who delivered it were lovely. They were working long hours that day so apparently mother gave them some coffee and a doughnut to enjoy while they were working.

I did get to do my writing, though I did start late, Not because of the new appliances but simply because I wanted to start a little later. I went upstairs at my usual time but I watched a movie up there first before I started writing. I worried that I would not have the drive to get anything done and at first there were a few moments of struggle. The intro to the scene was seamless but I could not pin down the first line of dialogue for the longest time. But, once I got past that, I found my stride. I wrote 750 words, which is very, very good for such a late starting day. Most of it was dialogue and I do think I'll change some of it tomorrow, plus description needs to be added in between, but it is a stronger start than I thought I'd manage to make today.

Sadly while I was writing to you we found a issue with the plumbing. There is a leak in the laundry room that drips into the basement. It is probably from the new washer installation but it is leaking in a place that the installers didn't touch. It is strange but at least the leak is small. We are running a test load now and we'll see what needs to be done about it in the future. It is astonishing to me how my parents can make an argument about something they fucking agree with. It is impossibly childish. Mother is worse about it than father but he still has  his moments. I just don't understand why it is so hard to hold your fucking tongue and focus on fixing the actual fucking problem.

I'm hoping that the issue is resolved enough that I don't need to listen to them bicker anymore tonight. I pray that be the case. For now, in this pleasant lull, I am going to make a coffee and try to relax. Wish me luck in that endeavour.

As the title suggests, I wanted to ask the community if anyone has a strategy to minimize the frequency of receiving restock bans. I just came back to the game a week or so ago, and the main method I've found to try and make some startup NP to go for creating my childhood dream pets is to restock shoppes. I typically will allot a couple of hours to sit down and do this in the evening, but I kid you not every single night this week I end up with a restock ban! It is driving me absolutely crazy. Last night especially frustrated me because I had just had a late night coffee to keep me up an extra couple of hours to try and snag a high-value item. Within 20 minutes, boom no more shop inventory. It is driving me up a wall.

  
So, back to my original question, does anyone have any strategies they use? Only restock for 30 minutes at a time or something? At this point, its interfering with my daily quests as I typically have one that requires I buy an item from any Neopian shoppe.

After purchasing lots of my pillows for the holidays for family and extra pillow cases after buying pillows in the past, 

this years order came with a box to click for a sample of coffee and 3 small cans of “rev 7” free with purchase.

I asked for a Supervisor and was told by “Eddie” if we refund for you we have to refund for everyone.  Obviously it is set up to deceive.  I was told there was noone higher that the owner himself went on record by saying that there is no refund for any reason and he did not have the authority to refund and the policy stood. Other than the owner he said there was no one higher to speak to.  Odd since Amazon and all retail companies have customer support and I have never had any company saddle me with an unwanted product at a cost of $50/ with no way to return.

I was offered a credit but don’t need anything and won’t for a very long time since I already paid for all the pillows and merchandise the family got for the holidays.

1qf0fdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qf0fdv/how_to_rebuild_yourself_after_a_breakup_the/,How To Rebuild Yourself After A Breakup: The Neuroscience That Actually Works,"You know that feeling when a breakup hits, and suddenly you can't focus on anything? Your brain turns into mush, work becomes impossible, and you're doom-scrolling at 3 am, wondering what went wrong.

Yeah, turns out there's actual science behind why breakups wreck us so hard. I went down a rabbit hole of research (books, podcasts, neuroscience papers) because I was tired of the ""just move on"" advice that never actually helps anyone.

The wild part? Your brain literally treats heartbreak like physical pain. The same neural pathways light up. This isn't weakness or being dramatic; it's biology doing its thing. But here's what's useful: understanding how your brain processes loss gives you actual tools to rebuild faster.

**What's actually happening in your brain**

When you lose someone significant, your brain goes into threat mode. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) explains this perfectly in his podcast: attachment bonds create neural pathways, and when those bonds break, your prefrontal cortex (the part handling focus and decision-making) basically short-circuits.

Your brain kept a ""map"" of that person, their patterns, and your shared routines. Now that the map is useless, your brain keeps referencing it anyway. That's why random things trigger you. A song. Their favorite restaurant. The specific way someone laughs.

The dopamine system also gets messed up. You were getting regular hits of connection and validation; now that source has vanished. Your brain goes into seeking mode, which is why you obsessively check their social media or draft texts you'll never send.

*Attached* by Amir Levine is insanely good on this. Levine is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia, and this book breaks down attachment theory in ways that'll make you question everything you thought about relationships. The core idea: we're biologically wired for attachment, and understanding your attachment style (anxious, avoidant, or secure) explains so much of your behavior post-breakup. Best relationship psychology book I have ever read.

**The focus problem nobody talks about**

Here's something that hit me: breakups don't just hurt emotionally; they tank your cognitive function. Studies show that people going through relationship dissolution perform worse on attention tasks, memory tests, and even basic problem-solving.

Why? Your brain allocates massive resources to processing the loss. It's running background calculations constantly: ""Why did this happen? What could I have done differently? What does this mean about me?""

Huberman mentions this thing called ""limbic friction,"" where your emotional brain and logical brain are basically fighting each other. The emotional side wants to ruminate and feel everything. The logical side is trying to function normally. This friction drains mental energy like crazy.

*The Comfort Book* by Matt Haig helped me here. Haig dealt with [severe depression and anxiety](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/allinthemind/depression-and-reasons-to-stay-alive/6494972), nearly didn't make it, and wrote this as a collection of truths that kept him alive. It's not your typical self-help garbage. Just honest, raw observations about being human and getting through hard things. One line stuck with me: ""You are more than your worst days."" Simple, but it hits different when you're spiraling.

The app \*\*Headspace\*\* has specific meditation courses for dealing with sadness and emotional pain. I know meditation sounds like that advice people give when they don't know what else to say, but the ""Letting Go of Sadness"" pack actually teaches you how to sit with difficult emotions without getting consumed. Like 10 minutes a day made a noticeable difference in my ability to focus at work.

There's also \*\*[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/)\*\*, an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews on relationship psychology and emotional recovery. You can literally type in ""heal after a breakup as someone with anxious attachment,"" and it generates a structured learning plan built around your specific situation. 

The app creates personalized audio podcasts from vetted sources, everything from attachment theory research to relationship experts' insights. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives when something really clicks. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on what you highlight and how you interact with the virtual coach. It's been helpful for connecting the dots between different psychology concepts without having to read ten books cover to cover.

Rewiring takes time but it happens faster than you think

Neuroplasticity is your friend here. Your brain can and will adapt. The neural pathways associated with your ex will weaken through a process called ""synaptic pruning."" But you have to actually let them weaken.

Every time you stalk their Instagram or replay old conversations, you're reinforcing those pathways. You're literally keeping the pain alive at a neural level. Cold turkey works better than gradual withdrawal for this reason.

Huberman recommends ""[non-sleep deep rest](https://www.hubermanlab.com/nsdr)"" protocols. Basically these are practices that put your brain in recovery mode: yoga nidra, certain types of meditation, and even just lying still with your eyes closed for 20 minutes. Your brain processes and files away emotional experiences during these states.

\*\*How to Do the Work\*\* by Dr. Nicole LePera is a game changer. LePera is a clinical psychologist who went viral for making psychology accessible. This book gives you a framework for understanding your patterns, why you pick the people you pick, and how to actually break cycles instead of just understanding them intellectually. The exercises are practical, not fluffy. This is the best personal development book for understanding yourself at a deeper level.

**The rebuilding part everyone rushes**

People will tell you to hit the gym, pick up hobbies, and ""focus on yourself."" That's not wrong, but it's incomplete.

What actually helps: building new neural associations with things that used to remind you of them. Going to that coffee shop alone and having a good experience there. Listening to ""your song"" while doing something you enjoy. You're literally rewriting your brain's associations.

Also, don't pathologize sadness. Western culture treats any negative emotion like a problem to fix immediately. Sometimes you need to feel like shit for a bit. The issue is when you set up camp there.

Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett's research on emotional granularity is useful here. The more precisely you can label what you're feeling (not just ""sad"" but ""grieving the future I imagined"" or ""angry at myself for ignoring red flags""), the better your brain can process and move through it.

The \*\*[Finch](https://finchcare.com/)\*\* app is surprisingly helpful for this. It's a self-care app with a little bird companion; it sounds childish, but it's actually well designed. It prompts you daily to check in with specific emotions, set small goals, and track patterns in your mood. Way less intimidating than traditional therapy apps.

What actually matters

You're not broken because a breakup wrecked you. You're human. Your brain formed bonds that took time and proximity and shared experiences to build. They don't dissolve overnight just because the relationship ended.

The neuroscience shows recovery happens in waves, not linearly. Some days you'll feel fine, then get hit with a wave of grief. That's normal. The waves get smaller and further apart, but expecting them to stop completely right away is setting yourself up to feel like you're failing.

Focus on the inputs you can control: sleep schedule, movement, social connection, and limiting rumination. Your brain will do the rest of the rebuilding work automatically if you give it the right conditions.

And maybe most importantly, this experience is rewiring you in ways that'll make you more resilient. People who properly process heartbreak develop stronger emotional regulation, better boundaries, and a clearer understanding of what they need.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip.

I've read countless threads for last few weeks just trying to make sense of what is surely the worst thing I've ever had to endure in my life and the only conclusion I can seem to come to is that it's all my fault. The second I try to reason with myself given my own flaws and things that life has thrown at me throughout this year, I can't help but always think that they're just excuses. While I don't think it matters because in the end it did me and my baby no good, but I am diagnosed with OCD, depression, anxiety and possible ADHD and have been taking medication (increasingly more over time) for over a year now going on to two. The overwhelming guilt that I feel at this moment is taking a toll on me and while part of the reason for me to make this post is to gain some of my own perspective through outside opinions and stories, another part of me just wants to let other people take a jab at me, prolong my mental suffering because of what my kitty had to go through under my care.

My cat made it to 12 years old, around April of this year he would have been 13 and I couldn't more devastated that he wasn't able to make it another year. I remember the first day that I met him like it was just yesterday, truly. My mom and I were returning some textbooks to one of my younger sister's school library and there was this kid and the librarian talking next to a paper ream box. As we got closer I hear the boy say that he could ask his parents to take him but he had big dogs so maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea. That's when I saw the fluffiest, tiniest, cutest little Tuxedo cat that I had ever seen in my life! My mom stuck her had in to pet him and he immediately hissed at her. We, of course, gushed over him while there but eventually proceeded with our business and starting to leave because I was also on a time crunch since I had work afterwards. We leave but before we could even round the building we had just exited, I tell my mom I couldn't just leave him there. That short walk had my eyes welled up with tears that spilled as I convinced my mom to let me bring him home with us. I ran so fast back to that library, excitedly told the librarian we could take him and that was the start of my life with my best friend.

I didn't grow up having my own pets like a cat or dog, we only had fish for a few years that my mom and siblings all cared for. By the time I brought in baby we had one dog that was about 5ish (possibly a little younger), so I was no stranger to taking care of a pet with more responsibilities. Side note: that same day that I brought my cat, my then stepdad also rescued a dog that was being mistreated so we ended up with two new pets in one day for a total of three! I was young, not even 20 yet and trying to figure my life out. I worked a minimum wage job and did everything in my power to provide for my cat (I tried to make it point to cover every and all his expenses since I literally cried for him) the best that I could with what I had. I made mistakes along the way, it was all new to me and with every milestone I hit I made sure to also give my cat better food, better care, etc. I eventually moved out with my now fiancé  for school when my baby was about 3 and for two years I had a very busy schedule trying to finish up school and work like a mad man so he spent a lot of time alone but always made sure to make time to check on him even if it was just for a quick second. I graduated in June of 2019 and eventually we decided to move to LA but spent some months back home with my family while I worked to save some money before my move. My partner made the move first, I moved a couple of months after and because we were essentially living in a room for 6 months, I had to leave my cat in my family's care for that time because we didn't have a space for him. Mentally and emotionally I was not okay but knew that we were doing my best to get us all settled into an apartment in LA. My life tends to just throw a lot of curveballs at me and, of course, this time was no different because COVID hit and next thing we know everything is shutting down. Luckily at this point I had been working a steady job since December of 2019 and my partner and I managed to get an apartment in MARCH of 2020. I was so desperate to bring my cat back and worried we wouldn't be let out of the city since everything was so up in the air at the time. We literally made a one day trip up about 5 hours and back down another 5 hours to make sure I could have him with me. I have been a WFH employee since that point on and have been able to make up for any time I was ever away from my baby.

Some issues started to arise after the move, and he had always been prone to sensitive stomach but nothing that was not manageable at home. He had regular visits since I got him, vaccines as needed, dental cleanings were mostly up to date but also pretty regular, microchipped and he was neutered at about 4ish years old. I wasn't aware of the downfalls of not neutering and his spraying really started to become issue so he underwent the surgery and then he gained a significant amount of weight. I later was able to have him lose the weight and other than usual bouts of stomach sensitivities that included hairballs, and one drinking strike that was treated by a vet (we're coastal people so we were not ready for an LA summer) he was living it up in his new city. As the years went by, he got progressively more and more difficult to handle at the vet and obviously with COVID, vet visits were usually just drop-off and I'm sure that only made his vet anxiety worse. He was a super stubborn cat, admittedly he might have gotten that from me but it made it difficult to administer things to sedate him without stressing him out. He was also for whatever reason just able to burn through even the highest doses of sedation so vet visits started to just turn into them not being able to get any testing done because he was just too much to handle. That's when I had to really pick and choose when I absolutely needed to take him in because otherwise it was just putting a toll on me and most importantly him and that was not something I wanted to keep doing since he was just getting older. He would still go at least once a year for vaccines and dewormer, etc. Again, because we had dealt with stomach issues before, I would let things play out first and actively be doing home remedies (things that have worked in the past) while monitoring. Last year we had to take him in to the ER as he was suddenly very still, very quiet and just looked all over off and when I went to pick him up he cried. Immediately I took him in, looking back he had been sort of hiding under the couch for a bit but was playing with me while under there so I didn't catch on. Turned out to be severe arthritis and hip dysplasia. I was so sad, of course, and instantly made the necessary changes in the apartment to ensure that he didn't hurt himself. Got a smaller tower, he didn't seem happy about that, more enrichment toys that would allow him to stay lower on the ground, an orthopedic bed and a heating pad to soothe his bones. He was also on Gabapentin for his pain while I researched (OCD/healthy anxiety) other options and waited on information from my usual vet on the Solensia vaccine. That was al whole back and forth and since my cat was NOT good at the vet, I kept him on just the Gaba since he was doing well on it and we had found a dosage that allowed him to feel relief and not be zonked all day with adjustments being made when needed. All that said, this year didn't totally seem any different until they were really different starting July/November 2025.

Earlier in the year in March, another curveball hit and our family dog passed away at 16. He was put to his final rest the day of his birthday and my mom was the only one able to be there with him which I am so sad about to this day. That very next day I get texts from my sister that she's not feeling well and sure enough the next curveball was here and she had to be admitted into emergency surgery. Next thing I know, I'm on the road for 6 hours and with her for the next two weeks to help her recover at the hospital and then back home. Finally, I'm back home with my cat and again he had had bouts of stomach issues and again they were things that would resolve at home. He was also prone to getting into things and as much as I would try to clean and keep things out of his reach there was the occasional running after him and prying his mouth open to see what he might had gotten into. But July he was having a particularly bad go of it and after things didn't seem to resolve when I would have expected to, I made an appointment to the vet to have him seen. They very painstakingly were able to see him (I believe I had to take him at least twice because the first time they weren't able to get anything done due to his temperament) and took blood to run tests. They advised me to stop down on the pumpkin I was providing him, and whatever else I had been trying to help with his bowel movements but they also told me he was slightly anemic. This is one of the moments I keep looking back on that I wish I was more proactively in his health and wish I could go back in time to scream at myself to push for more testing. It didn't help that he was also dealing with fleas at the time and he's also always had a sensitivity to them (once resulted in a pretty nasty scabbing situation that was treated with medicated shampoo until it went away, thankfully) so I figured that was the reason for that and the vet while possibly asking if I wanted to do further testing (I genuinely cannot remember) didn't seem outwardly concerned so I thought I would save myself the money (I also was in a tight situation at the time and still am) and the stress for him as well and bring him back home.

Stopped down on all the extra changes I made to help his tummy like the vet mentioned and he was getting back to normal. Arthritis was being managed, tummy issues subsided for the time being and things were okay. After a couple of months he had some hairball cough ups and a scare that had me take him to the ER again thinking he was choking trying to cough up a hairball. I had hairball jelly at hand because it was something he just dealt with and being a longer haired cat didn't help when he wouldn't let me bathe/brush him. During all of this, he was always eating, drinking water (he was always a big water drinker) going to the bathroom, playing, etc. Fast forward to November and I noticed that his eating had slowed down. He was eating all of his food but he was not inhaling it (another reason for stomach issues, his feeding was constantly being adjusted to ensure that that was being minimized) At first it didn't concern be fully because it was really on and off and I figured he was not liking his prescription urinary wet food anymore so I made switch which he did seem to like when I started to offer him new foods. Again, kept keeping an eye on him because he had been losing weight but he was also on the chunkier/fluffier side and so it wasn't noticeable at first. Once I noticed his weight really and could feel his bones, Thanksgiving came around and a friend (also Sebastian's human friend) we had over made a comment about him looking really slim. At that point I believe I had made an appointment for the vet for a dental cleaning because he was chewing strangely. His teeth were grinding, chewing only on one side and dropping food. Going to the bathroom, drinking water, definitely playing less and napping more but still here with us. Come December 12, he had his vet visit to have his teeth cleaned, update vaccines and run blood tests where I expressed all my concerns with his eating habits and his weight. Got a call later that he was all good to go, picked him up and talked to the vet about the results. Again, she mentioned being anemic (slightly still) but asked if I wanted to do further testing which I agreed to because the slow, prolonged change in his eating was a not normal behavior for him. Waited days for a call back from the vet to discuss what else might have been found while my cat's eating keep going down but not completely stopped. I was out buying different foods, toppers, baby food, you name it and likely many other stories that I've read, he really liked his Churu treats so I would let him have as many as he would like and he was still actively seeking out his dry food (also prescription) so he was grazing throughout the day. Results came back and there were definitely issues with his RBC and WBC that required more testing on the blood which I also agreed to because he was slowly declining. December 21, he really slowed down and I tried to give him some Gaba in hopes to help with whatever pain it would ease and I tried calling the vet to discuss the results but they were closed. Called the next day 12/22 and asked if the doctor was able to call me sooner so I can see what else I could/should do. Another moment I wish I would have just taken him into the ER sooner but I was really thinking something had to be wrong with his teeth, and I had initially declined a dental imagining but started to ask for it because I just figured there must have been something that wasn't able to just be plainly seen.

It's now December 23 and both my fiancé and I had been taking turns getting up at all hours of the day/night to check on his eating and just being with him in general. My fiancé go up earlier than I had at this point and he came in saying that Sebastian looked scared, anxious so I went to check on him and noticed he did seem shaken up but for whatever reason I thought it was just a random zoomie and I went back to bed because I was exhausted. I instantly crashed out and I guess my cat had come into our room and he would do this thing where he would scratch at the side of the bed (he left his mark wherever he went) and I would lift him up into bed with me. He would do it so often that I would basically do it in my sleep and have no recollection of having seen him or heard him or picked him up, it was just engrained in me. He came to nap with me that same morning and in my sleep I instinctively picked him up and put him into bed right next to me. Next thing I know I hear a loud thump that jolted me awake. This all was really only in the span of maybe an hour and a half but I shot out of bed and ran out to the living room looking for my baby and saw him in our office area on top of the desk again with a wide eye look and when I went to grab him to bring him down he cried. He ran under a little table and I instantly knew he needed to go to the ER. I immediately grabbed his crate, got dressed and bolted out the door. Waiting is the worst, I'm incredibly impatient and the longer I wait the worse my thoughts get and they had already been turning to dark and intrusive thoughts for a few days now so I left for a bit to get my medication for myself and maybe get some coffee to keep me awake. Before I can make it home I get a call saying I need to come back, turns out they need to do an ultrasound, which will require more sedation because he is fighting every vet back there. I agree and head back out a second time for my medication and coffee, and to maybe sort myself out for a second because the ER is not usually a happy place to be at much less during the holidays. I get back home, clean up a little so that my baby wouldn't have to deal with me stress cleaning while he was back home. I was set to pick up my fiancé from work since we only have the one car and as soon as I get there, he gets in the car and I get another call from the ER... another curveball, we got the news right then and there that he had a very big mass in his stomach that while was not currently not causing a blockage, was in a particularly bad location to operate on. Given his age, the stage of the cancer and his just overall temperament for the vet, they said that we should consider humane euthanasia. My fiancé had to take over the call because I was hyperventilating at this point and on the verge of screaming.

We finally calmed down enough to drive back out to the clinic to pick up my Sebastian. My partner took over from there and went in by himself to talk to the vets and I waited in the car until he was ready to be brough out. I wanted to make sure I was the first face he saw once he was back in his carrier. We paid our bill, headed back home with pain medication and spent our last night with him that night in the living room. We had arranged for a vet to come to our home for an at-home euthanasia on December 24. I still can't process what happened, and I almost always manage to convince myself that it was all my fault because I was supposed to take care of him and I couldn't.  miss him, my baby, my Sebastian more every day and every day I blame myself more and more. I only hope that Budda was there to greet him so he isn't scared and that they're together again. Budda was his older dog brother, he would help me keep an eye on Sebastian and I could tell that they really loved each other. Our family has endured so much loss this year but we still have our Cesar, our other rescue back home with family. There are so many things I'll never forgive myself for, and this is one of them. I don't think I can ever have another pet in fear of failing them like I did my own pets. I've had a weight in my chest for almost a month now, pain, like my heart is literally broken and I haven't been able to take an actual breath ever since. I don't know how I'll ever move past this, I don't want to frankly and I don't feel like I deserve to.

Housing prices? That’s what happens when you live somewhere desirable. If you can’t afford it there are plenty of cheaper places in Canada that don’t have ocean views bike lanes or artisan coffee every 50 metres.

Traffic is fine. If you’re stuck in congestion maybe try biking. The city clearly invested in bike lanes for a reason. And before someone says not everyone can bike sure but most people probably could if they actually wanted to.

Property taxes are reasonable considering how many services we get. Clean parks progressive policies climate leadership and a city council that actually listens unlike most places. Complaining about taxes while demanding more services is peak Victoria hypocrisy.

The homelessness issue is complex but pretending Victoria alone caused it is lazy thinking. This is a national problem and at least Victoria is compassionate instead of pretending people don’t exist.

Also if you’ve lived here your whole life and keep saying Victoria used to be better that might just be nostalgia. Cities change. If you want a sleepy town with no growth there are lots of small Island communities.

I’m a former LCMS member beginning classes to explore Catholicism. It feels like there aren’t very many people like mysef — a hater of Trump, but also a believer of the inerrancy of the Bible. I chose Catholicism because I love what Pope Leo has to say; the priest at what will be new church doesn’t strike me as MAGA (very impt); and I love the fact that the Catholic Church doesn’t exclude any Catholics from communion based on their lifestyle choices. At least this is what I have read when studying up in it. I also had a profound experience which led me to the conclusion that I wanted to be in a church where there was some emphasis put on good works because I believe it changed me and brought me closer to Christ. At LCMS they seem obsessed with Grace alone, faith alone….I believe that, but I also think God probably wants us to do good works to show His love.

Now, to the point. As I grow stronger in my faith and as the world here in the USA grows crazier and crueler, I have felt an urgency to share God’s word. I’ve never been good at doing it. Most of my friends are not Christians, but my two best girlfriends self-identify as such. However, they’re not very similar to me at all. For two and half years I’ve met up with them to talk about lives over coffee. We usually talk about politics too. Tonight, tho, we ended up talking religion and it was kinda tense for a minute. I had mentioned that the Bible clearly says Christians will be persecuted for their faith. Of course they are all over the world now, but I was specifically wondering if we in the U.S. might be persecuted in the future if we ever get T out of office. My reasoning is that maga has made a really bad name for us. 

Both friends pushed back as if that thought based on Scripture was nonsense. I finally just asked them in the least condescending and confrontational way I could how they were Christian if they didn’t believe in the Bible. They both said it was about treating people with kindness and having a personal relationship with Jesus. The one friend had just finished complaining about her maga father cherry picking the Old Testament. I couldn’t help myself but to point out she kind of cherry picks what sh3 likes as well…a little reincarnation, a little Buddhism, some Jesus, etc. I asked how she knew Jesus if she’s not a believer in the Bible. We all three shared and I think it went okayish, but I cried 9n the way home because I love them and I don’t want to lose them. I don’t think I have, but I hate coming off holier than thou. I did push a bit and challenge them with these questions I asked. 

I guess I just came here to share and say it sure is hard sharing faith. I try to be respectful of people’s journeys and beliefs, but I don’t want my dear friends to be unprepared for whatever I can’t help but feel is looming. I feel like I look come off as a lunatic. Oh yeah, I literally told all friends and family still supporting DT that I was rebuking them because Christians are called to do that in love for one another. I’m sure they all hate me, but whatever. ",6,1768615504.0,LeftCatholicism,3,0.88,False

I wanted to create a post for people to organize gatherings with other fans in their local community at their local bookstore (support your local independent bookstore if you have one!) for the January 20 release day for Twelve Months! Or in case a local bookstore is already hosting a release party, then advertise that here! I haven't seen any mentions of a release party in my community, and I suppose that's the case in most places. So let's make our own.

If you're willing to gather with a few people on January 20th, then post:

1. Name of your local bookstore

2. The address

3. A time (it's a Tuesday, so after work hours like 6pm would be better for most folks). 

If you live in a place with public transportation, try to pick a place that would be easy to get to by public transport. If not, oh well pick the best you can. People might show up, people might not. No way to know unless you try! If no one shows, that's okay. You still have a cool book to talk about with your friends over here in the sub.

If it looks like you're getting an outsized gathering, make some friends and plan to disperse to nearby bars/restaurants/coffee shops/whatever with your new pals so the bookstore doesn't get too annoyed.

If you find someone already posted a bookstore near you, then head over there and make some friends!",1,1768615055.0,dresdenfiles,2,1.0,False
1qezx7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qezx7m/i_dont_know_whats_real/,I Don’t Know What’s Real,"I met my wife, Katelyn, when she was 20. I was 40. She was a singer in my band, and I was lead guitar. I guess it’s important to mention that I was also married when I met her. I was married for quite a while after I met her. Anyway, back to how we met. She was singing in random bars with another band when my friend, Mark, introduced us. He said she’d be the perfect fit for us, and boy was she.

From the moment I laid eyes on her, I was hooked. It also didn’t help that my wife was never around. She never came to a show, so the main person I talked to was Katelyn. Hell, the only people I was close to were her, Mark, and the other guys in the band. She was just something special.

About 5 years after meeting her, the band all started to gradually go our separate ways. She moved off to go to college, and I was still stuck in our dump of a town with a woman I didn’t love. Sure, Katelyn kept in touch, but communication got slimmer and slimmer until we didn’t speak at all. I still saw her in everything. Every good moment, bad moment, anything, I wished so badly I could tell her about it. She got some douchebag boyfriend and that was the end of it, or so I thought.

I’ll never forget it. It was a random Tuesday night in May. I was sitting in the living room watching God knows what with my wife. Just sitting in silence as usual, until the sound of my phone ringing ripped through the air. Nothing could prepare me for the name showing on my screen.

“It’s work, I’ve got to take this,” I said to my wife walking out the door.

“Kate?” I asked, as though it couldn’t possibly be her. “What’s up?”

That’s when I heard her crying. I don’t know why, but I panicked. “Katelyn, what’s wrong?”

She lost it. She explained in between sobs how she just wanted to die. She and her boyfriend had been split up for about 6 months, and she went downhill from there. There was nothing in the world that could make her want to stay. There was no one in the world who could love her. Her whole life was falling apart, and she was a constantly fighting the demons in her mind.

“Kate listen to me, and listen carefully. I love you. I have always loved you. You are worth loving, and you cannot do whatever it is you’re thinking about doing.”

“I know plenty of people love me, but I’m broken. I’ll never get married, have a family, anything,” she told me.

I took in a breath and explained to her carefully.

“I’m in love with you. This whole time. I never planned on telling you that. Ever. But you need to know that there’s someone who would be absolutely destroyed if you did anything to yourself.”

To put it simply, she said she loved me, too. We started meeting once a week, just to spend a few minutes together. Then, it turned into visits to her house 3 hours away. Sometimes I’d stay the night on “work trips”. She was always conflicted on the fact that I was married, but she wasn’t committed enough to me for me to have a reason to leave.

“Every morning, I reach over for you and you’re not there,” I’d tell her. “One day, I’m going to reach over, and you’ll be there. I’ll tell you ‘you’re not real’, but you’ll kiss me and tell me you are. That’s how it will be when we’re finally together.”

This affair went on for a year before she called me and told me to get my shit and come home. Within 6 months I was divorced and living with her. Another 6 months later, we were married. She was finally Mrs. Katelyn Hall.

I had all I’d ever wanted. It was everything I’d dreamed it would be. We’d stay up late watching movies, talking, laughing, loving each other. Every morning, I’d reach over and put my fingers in her hair.

“You’re not real,” I’d tell her. Every single morning, and every single morning she’d kiss me, look at me with those beautiful brown eyes and say, “John, I’m real.”

Life was perfect, or so I thought.

Katelyn struggled with depression. She was on medication for it, and for the most part it was good, but one Sunday morning, something was off. Very off

I was running my fingers through that long blonde hair of hers. Just studying her face until she stirred awake.

“You’re not real,” I said smiling at her.

And for the first time in a year, she said nothing. She rolled out of bed and went to the bathroom. The only thing I heard that morning was her footsteps to the bathroom, a period of silence, then the bathtub faucet being turned on.

I had no idea what the fuck was going on. Sure, we fought from time to time, but hardly ever after we got married. I had done nothing to warrant the cold shoulder.

I got up to make coffee and listened to silence. I guess she just needed to relax. Maybe she was getting depressed again. I could handle anything. I could help her through this if that was the case.

I had two cups of coffee while I watched the news. When I realized she wasn’t planning on coming out anytime soon, I walked to the bathroom door.

“Kate? Baby, I’m going to run to the store to get stuff to make us breakfast. Anything in particular you’d like?”

Nothing.

“Okay.. I’ll make pancakes unless you object.”

Nothing.

“Baby I don’t know what’s wrong, but whatever it is, we’ll figure it out. We always do. I’m going to give you some space. I’ll be back soon. I love you so much.”

Nothing.

I racked my brain the whole way to and from the grocery store. She had to be depressed. Maybe she had missed some of her medication? I didn’t know, but something wasn’t right.

When I got home, I sat the bags of groceries on the counter and walked to the bathroom door.

“Baby please talk to me.”

Nothing

“Katelyn you’re scaring me.”

Nothing.

I turned the door knob, but it was locked.

“Katelyn! I’m going to break this door down. I’ve tried to be patient all morning, but you’re scaring me.” All I could think about was that phone call on a Tuesday in May a few years back.

Nothing again.

I rammed my shoulder in the door twice and it flew open.

What I saw was horrific.

She was in lying in the bathtub with her eyes partially open, but the water was bright red, and both arms had long vertical slits in them.

What happened next is a blur, but I know I could feel a faint pulse, and I called for an ambulance.

She laid on the gurney with a blanket over her in the ambulance. They were doing CPR, yelling out her vitals, pumping fluids into her. It was a nightmare of a scene. When we got to the hospital, they took her straight to the trauma unit. They kept me in the hallway as they tried desperately to revive her. About 15 minutes later, a man in a white coat stepped out of her room.

“Mr. Hall, I’m so sorry, but there was nothing we could do.”

The doctor’s voice rang in my ears and I slid down the wall.

I screamed, cried, flailed. They tried to calm me down but I couldn’t stopped freaking the fuck out. This is where everything got so much worse.

While my back was against the wall, they restrained me. I didn’t understand. The love of my life was dead, and they were restraining me. The next thing I know, a needle is in my arm, and I slowly fade into unconsciousness.

When I wake up, I’m in a blank white room, restrained to a bed. At this point I’m terrified and beyond confused, so I just start screaming.

“What the fuck did you do to me?!”

Nothing.

I screamed a few more times until a nurse came in.

“John, it’s okay. You’re at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital. It’s 2024.”

“What? It’s 2025,” I said shakily, “My wife just killed herself, and you’re fucking with me?”

“John, Katelyn Samson killed herself May 10th, 2022. I know you’re confused, but you’re being taken care of. You just had a bad night.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?!”

And then it hit me.

It was Tuesday, May 10, 2022. I was sitting in the living room watching God knows what with my wife. Just sitting in silence as usual, until the sound of my phone ringing ripped through the air.

It was Mark. He was probably high and just wanted to shoot the shit. I went to the bathroom to get some privacy.

“Hey man, what’s up?”

“John. Katelyn shot her self in the head the morning.”

My blood ran completely cold.

“She left a note,” he told me. “Said she was doing the world a favor by being gone. That she couldn’t live life knowing someone couldn’t possibly love her.”

The woman I was madly in love with had killed herself not knowing how loved she was. If I had just told her, she’d probably still be alive.

Mark went on to tell me he’d find out funeral arrangements, apologized because he knew how close we were, and got off the phone.

I was so numb and so heartbroken all at the same time. I ran a hot bath and sunk down into the tub.

I had dreamt of this woman since the day I met her. I had never loved a woman like I did her, and she was gone. My wife’s razor sat on the edge of the tub. I was able to break it open and retrieve a blade from it. I ran it up my left arm, then my right. As a my eyes got heavy, the last thing I heard was my wife screaming.

“John?” The nurse said touching my hand. “Are you remembering?”

I looked up at her and nodded slowly.

“This happens sometimes. It’s good you’re remembering. Do you think we’re good to remove the restraints?”

I nodded again.

She freed my arms and legs and left me to “rest”, whatever that was supposed to mean. I looked around the room and the emptiness of the space. My mind was going 90 to nothing trying to catch up to time. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a figure, and turned sharply to my right.

There she was, my beautiful blonde haired, brown eyed love of my life, smiling at me.

What she said next had me back in those goddamned restraints within minutes.

This is my first Reddit post so hopefully I do this correctly. My husband and I have just started our nanny search for our daughter who will be 6 months old at the time of job start. I’m hoping to get input and feedback from you on whether the job requirements/environment is attractive. There are three parts we would like feedback on 

\* My daughter is exclusively breastfed — she does not take a bottle. We have tried and have not been successful. This will mean that our nanny will need to coordinate with me a few times a day to feed my daughter.

\* My husband and I both work from home — our work spaces are contained to areas of the house that we can stay out of our nanny’s space and we will actively try to ensure we are not interfering, but some overlap of common spaces seems inevitable (e.g. lunch time)

\* For now, we don’t want our nanny to drive our daughter anywhere — we are perfectly happy for our nanny to take walks with our daughter. There are miles of neighborhoods in our vicinity, a library, a grocery store, a few coffee shops all in walking distance. We might eventually be comfortable with our nanny driving our daughter but I can’t say for sure. 

We are planning to pay at the top of the salary range for our area, as well as PTO, ample sick time, potentially a healthcare stipend, and a generous end of year bonus.

Any feedback or input on the above would be helpful. I’m basically wondering if a nanny would feel that we would be potentially be too intertwined in the day to day of the job. Thank you in advance!",3,1768614918.0,Nanny,14,0.8,False

Monday, manic lahat ng tao kasi ang daming workload na dumating. Nagde-stress kami ng mga ka department ko, we ordered coffee. Since grab ko yung ginamit, I used my card to pay and they transferred their individual payments sa akin except for Dana (not her real name, bagong assign sa department). 

Wednesday, another “deserve ko mag-kape” moment kasi ang taas ng meeting period nag OT kami para mahabol yung deliverables. Same scenario, everybody who ordered paid me except Dana. I reminded her after she received her order about Monday’s utang and today. Sabi naman nya “oo later ate magbabayad ako” pero no payment was given that night. Sige kako tom nalang.

Thursday, wala. Pero nakapag order ng grab sa lunch worth 536.50. How did I know? I was at the pantry when she was plating her lunch pero lumabas ng hindi tinatapon yung paper bag na may nakatape na receipt. Monday and Wednesday order had a total of 480 pesos. This was 536.50, so kako baka nakalimutan na naman. So I politely asked her, yung payment ng coffee nung Monday and Wednesday. Tapos what shocked me was she asked me “Diba nagbigay na ako nung Wednesday te?” So naturally, I told her “Huy wala kang binibigay, pero nagsabi ka ng magbabayad ka.” Tapos she replied na baka she forgot.

Dito palang, alam ko na modus nito. I’ve been working for 11 years na, and may vibes talaga ako na not right.

Friday, did not ask her and waited for the payment. Pero wala pa din. But nagcoffee break sya with other people. SB din yon. 

So ngayong Sabado, OT kami ng some of our workmates, I ordered coffee for myself and 2 of my colleagues. The 2 paid din naman agad. Nung dumating si Dana (late sya) she loudly said “hala nagorder pala kayo ng coffee, sana nasali nyo ko wala pa naman akong tulog kasi nagparty kami sa xxxxx kagabi” 

So my colleague answered her na “alam mo namang mago-ot since kahapon tayo nagrequest sana di ka na nagparty” she replied that she was invited by a friend and the place was “bougie and instagrammable” pang ig and reels lang daw sana. So irked me then asked her yung bayad mo sa coffee nung monday and wednesday di pa nata-transfer. She was then shocked and told me “Hala ate? di pa ba? parang nagsend na ako nung Friday” I stood my ground and replied na “wala pa, kaya nga ako ng nagre-remind.”

She then replied in a “nagmamakaawa?” voice idk how to describe it “oo na, babayaran naman ate papacash-in lang ako send ko po later.” Tapos pumunta na sya sa table nya. After she said that my colleague then told me “huy kawawa naman yung bata” so ako, HA? Anong kawawa? Baka ako? Kasi binabaon nalang sa limot. Now, I could pay naman for the amount of her coffee when my statement arrives pero what irks me is the accountability of paying someone na in the first place ganon naman yung na-agreehan. Tapos habang patagal na ng patagal yung pagsingil mo nababaon na sa limot? Di ako nagt-trabaho para manlibre ng tao aside kung kusa. Kung di naman makakabayad agad, why order in the first place?

1qezqbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qezqbd/oak/,Oak,"I can’t believe I forgot about her. After everything that happened, that ought to have been impossible. And yet, it’s been 20 years since I last spoke of miss Reed. I figured this would be a good time to write it down, if only to get it out of my system once and for all. Then again, maybe this will go away too.

My mother had me at 39. She hadn’t planned on ever having kids, so when I came along, she had already settled for a certain lifestyle. She tried to pivot as best she could, but habits can be hard to break. She had a lucrative career that forced her to travel a lot, leaving me to be cared for by babysitters, aunts, uncles, and distant cousins. They were kind and generous people, eager to share everything from warm beds to hot meals. And the stories – there were always stories being told.

I ended up being a pretty good listener. I kept that trait all the way through high school, and I ended up studying human development and psychology, leading me to occupational therapy. I originally wanted to work with forensic psychology, but when it really came down to it, I wanted to help regular folks more than I wanted to put away bad guys.

I started seeing my first patients in the spring of 2003. Most of them were bi-weekly meetings, and after a couple of sessions many either quit entirely or reduced their visits to monthly, depending on their insurance coverage. Some had more permanent conditions that required regulated psychopharmaca that I would end up seeing over several years.

 

2005 started off uneventfully. I had to call on a neighbor to help get my cat Romeo out of a tree, but that was pretty much the height of excitement. Then I was scheduled to see a new patient; miss Reed. Now, I get new patients all the time, but miss Reed was a bit of an edge case. Most of my patients were assigned from insurance companies, but miss Reed came to me privately – paying out of her own pocket to see me. It wasn’t unheard of, but unusual. Especially considering her symptoms.

I met miss Reed on a late Tuesday afternoon in late May. It was pouring down, and I’d had three prior meetings. This was scheduled to be my last session for the day. You always have to be a bit extra careful at first meetings, you have to make sure people are at ease. I put out a small bowl of seedless grapes to show that she was expected and welcome. I emptied the trash to show that nothing gets left behind from previous patients. Just these little things remind them that it is a safe space, and that they’re free to share whatever.

Miss Reed stepped into my office with her short afro pulled back into a headband. She had pierced ears, but no jewelry. No necklace or rings. Her large brown eyes looked tired, but she tried her best to smile. I introduced myself and offered her a seat, asking her what she would like to talk about. She neatly placed her purse in her lap, took a deep breath, and looked me in the eyes.

“I’m not a person,” she said.

“What makes you say that?” I asked.

“That’s just the way things are now. I used to be a person, but now I’m not.”

“Do you know how this change came about?”

She adjusted her headband and nodded.

 

A couple of weeks prior to seeing me, miss Reed had been a helper on her niece’s outing for the Girl Scouts. They’d first gone to see Mount Rushmore, then they’d driven far out into the countryside to set up camp. They’d been following the Runalong river. Problem was, they forgot one of the tents. Miss Reed went back to get it on her own, and somewhere along that trail, *something* happened. That’s as specific as she could be – *something* happened. Pressing her on the matter, albeit gently, didn’t help. It’s not that she didn’t *want* to tell, it seemed she was unable to remember.

“When I got back to camp, I could feel something had changed,” miss Reed explained. “Like I’d been struck by a silent lightning.”

“And that was the moment you realized you weren’t a person anymore?”

“Not immediately,” miss Reed continued. “It came little by little. I would look at my hand and forget what it was, seeing it like it was a strange animal that crawled into my tent. My heart would skip a beat. Then I’d forget what a yawn was, or how to read facial cues.”

“Just like that?”

“Just like that.”

 

That first session with miss Reed was unusual for a lot of reasons, but I made a couple of observations. The whole event had the tellings of a trauma response, that something awful had happened to her along that river, and this was her way of protecting herself. Then again, I could tell there was something off. She had these strange tics, like picking her nose and pinching her cheek. She said it helped remind her that she had a face.

I made some notes about dissociative identity disorder or possible PTSD. Those were the first avenues to explore in our next session. She was perfectly pleasant to talk to, but I could tell this unnerved her. She wasn’t sleeping well, and she didn’t know what to make of it. She knew this wasn’t normal.

She wasn’t a *person* anymore. It’s like there was a part of her that’d been erased, and she kept being reminded of it.

 

We scheduled miss Reed’s second session a week later. There had been a mix-up with the dates, and her name had accidentally dropped off the schedule. My office had a joint administrator that handled booking for a couple of us working in the building, and things got lost sometimes – it happened. I thought I was done for the day when miss Reed walked in, but she didn’t seem all that upset. She offered to reschedule for another day, but I insisted she stuck around. I felt bad about her coming all the way to see me, only to be turned around at the door because of a booking error.

“This happens,” she smiled. “All kinds of things treat me like I’m not a person anymore. That goes for computers, too.”

“Do you think computers can make the distinction between a person and a not-person?”

“Everything can. They *have* to.”

We sat down and talked a little bit about her upbringing. She was a salt of the earth kind of South Dakota girl. Mid-20’s, worked in the family business. The way she talked about it surprised me – there was nothing *inherently* wrong. For all intents and purposes, there didn’t seem to be anything strange about her life apart from that one incident down the Runalong river – and she couldn’t remember any of it.

 

Before we ended the session, I wanted to ground her in something she could think about until next time. I brought up childhood memories. I figured if I could get her to think about something else than her affliction, that might alleviate some of her anxieties. I asked her to tell me about a positive memory.

“We had this oak by the field,” she smiled. “It had a swing, a treehouse, and the branches were so thick you could fall asleep on them. There was this hole where owls would roost. Everyone loved it. Played with it. Haven’t thought about it in years.”

“Well,” I said. “If you can’t be a person anymore, imagine yourself as an oak. *That* oak, if you will. Someone strong, and timeless. Those aren’t just properties of people; they’re things we cherish in everything.”

She nodded at that, and her smile lingered.

“Not a person,” she mumbled. “Imagine an oak.”

 

It took two weeks before I saw miss Reed again. I was a bit late for work as Romeo got out and ran up a tree. He was by far the most antisocial cat I’d ever owned. You had to bribe him to show his face around people, but the slightest sight of a tree had him sprinting for the door. At least this time I got him down without having to beg to use the neighbor’s ladder.

By the time I got to work, miss Reed was already there. The office administrator had completely forgotten that she was even in the waiting room. I apologized and invited her in, still combing leaves out of my hair. At least Romeo had been kind enough not to scratch me up.

“I’ve imagined it a lot,” miss Reed said. “Being an oak. I think that can be a beautiful thing.”

“I’m glad you think so,” I smiled. “Have you felt any different since we last met?”

“I’ve slept better,” she admitted. “I feel more energetic. I eat more. Drink better.”

“That’s good. Very good. I think we’re making progress.”

 

As we talked, I noticed a couple of unusual movements. Miss Reed angled herself so that she faced the morning sun coming in from the window. She would spread out her fingers like branches, as if trying to soak up the sun. The thought dawned on me that maybe I had accidentally replaced one fix idea with another. Then again, as long as it wasn’t harmful, maybe it was a step in the right direction.

“If you really were an oak, what would you do?” I asked.

“I would tell you that it’s me,” she smiled.

“How would you do that? An oak can’t talk.”

I figured that getting her to admit that certain features of being an oak are incompatible with her body, as to reinforce the properties of the tree rather than physicality. But miss Reed just nodded, thought about it for a while, and spoke in a low tone.

“I would grow my leaves black and blue. Then you would know it’s me.”

We had to cut the meeting short. I’d accidentally been double-booked. Miss Reed didn’t mind and told me she’d be in touch. As she hurried out, I got this cold feeling in my stomach. Something about her demeanor had changed, and I didn’t know if I liked it. She seemed happier, yes, but there was something else, too.

After she left, I spotted her standing in the parking lot, facing the sun. Her arms spread out, as if trying to catch the rays.

 

I thought a lot about miss Reed over the coming week. She didn’t schedule a new appointment. I had a lot of other patients to work with, but something about her particular problem felt unusual. I’d never even heard of the Runalong river, but something must have happened there. It was easy to imagine some kind of assault, but that would have shown itself in other ways. Her entire problem was summed up with a lack of identity, and I couldn’t understand the root cause.

I didn’t see miss Reed again until late June. I had just finished up a prior meeting and got back into my office. I sat down, flipped up my laptop, and saw two brown eyes staring at me from across the room.

I almost fell out of my chair.

Miss Reed had been standing there for God knows how long. She didn’t have an appointment, and I hadn’t heard from her in weeks. She looked different from when I last saw her. Her afro had grown sparse enough that I could see her scalp, and her eyes had grown darker.

“They don’t pick up my calls no more. The phone forgets to ring.”

I swallowed heard and took a deep breath.

“I’m sorry. That sounds very inconvenient.”

“Makes sense,” she mumbled. “Oak’s ain’t supposed to make phone calls.”

I noticed she wasn’t wearing any shoes. Her toenails had grown long, and the sharp edges got caught in the frills of the office rug. She sat down with a thud, letting her arms hang listlessly to the side like a stringless marionette.

 

I had originally planned to do some office work, but I could tell she wasn’t doing well. You have to be careful with volatile patients, even if they don’t have a history of violence. Miss Reed was exhibiting some uncomfortable behavior, and I wasn’t sure what to make of it.

“I keep having this dream,” she said. “Something dark comes down the river. The water pools beneath it, making the fish spin in circles long enough to die from exhaustion. There are dragonflies spinning round and round, drawing patterns in the air. Then I see it too. I touch it. And it feeds into me, like rainwater to a parched root.”

“And it tells you that you’re not a person.”

She nods.

“But not with words,” she clarifies. “But with an absence.”

She tried to get up, but she couldn’t quite get the balance right. She winced as if adjusting to sudden back pain. A tuft of hair drifted from her head, crumbling on the plate of seedless grapes. After a couple of seconds, she straightened out, turning completely still. I couldn’t even see her breathe.

“I don’t like what this is doing to me,” she whispered. “Why can’t I be a person anymore?”

“You are,” I said. “An oak, that was just… a grounding exercise. A way to recontextualize your self-image to something sturdy and positive.”

“I thought so too. But now I can’t stop it. That image is there. It’s stuck.”

“Miss Reed, what exactly do you think is happening?”

 

She walked forward like a child balancing over the stones of a river. I took a step back as she lunged forward, tripping on her own feet. She braced herself against my desk, then pushed herself back up.

“I dream about long fingers,” she said. “That my bones and nails grow longer, and longer, and longer. So long they touch the sky. And the farther they reach, the warmer I feel.”

She stretched her hand, crackling her knuckles.

“That warmth is wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. And in that moment I figured that, if I’m not a person, what’s so bad about being an oak?”

“What happens when you look at yourself in the mirror?” I ask. “What do you see there, if not a person?”

Her eyes widened as she pointed at me with a long-nailed finger.

“I see a *seed*.”

 

When miss Reed finally left my office, I barely noticed she was gone. It felt like she disappeared in a blink, but I knew for a fact that she’d been gone for a while. It’s like it was getting harder and harder to remember she’d been there in the first place. I wrote down ‘Miss Reed’ on a post-it and stuck it to my laptop, then talked to the administrator. She hadn’t even noticed miss Reed enter the building.

I felt responsible. Yes, my intentions had been to help, but I’d accidentally aided in her delusion. I’d misjudged just how impressionable she was, and this one suggestion had changed everything. And it didn’t look like it was making any changes for the better. If anything, I was getting more worried about her.

There is a certain line you shouldn’t cross as a mental health professional. You have to separate your work from your private life. I tried not to bring my worries about miss Reed with me home, but sometimes I couldn’t help it. Not because she was constantly on my mind, but because I found myself forgetting about her for large swathes of time. Days would pass without her name even registering in my conscious thoughts. I kept getting surprised to see that post-it on my laptop with her name on it over and over again.

That is, until one day, when the note was empty. And in that moment, a thought crossed my mind.

Can an oak have a name?

 

Despite forgetting about her over and over, I tried my best to make an effort. A conscious, *professional* kind of effort. Every time her name was brought up, I wrote it down, but I kept misplacing my notes. I would forget to save documents about her on my laptop. After a while, I started to think about her in abstract shapes and features. Not like a person, but like the way you remember the rubber texture of your favorite playground swing.

Sometimes I’d look up into my empty office, as if expecting to see her looking back. I never did. I couldn’t get a hold of her through the phone, so I tried reaching her through her family. I considered calling in a wellness check, but I couldn’t recall where she lived. The reason I call her ‘miss Reed’ here at all is because I genuinely can’t remember her first name. I’m not even sure miss Reed is the right name, but it’s the one I think about when I remember her.

Her family didn’t have much to say. Most of them barely remembered her, while others were making up memories on the fly.

“I think she finally got a place of her own.”

“Didn’t she move in with that guy, the one on…”

“Oh yeah, I’m sure she’s around, she’s just busy.”

But for all their reassurances, I wasn’t any closer to actually finding her. And as days turned to weeks, miss Reed faded from my memory. Not because I didn’t care, but because I couldn’t think of her as a patient. Whenever I pictured her, there was something else sitting across from me. Not a woman. Not a patient.

Not even a person anymore.

 

Things were almost normal for a while. I had other patients who kept me busy, and I spent my nights in the comfort of my home in the company of friends, family, and my cat. I didn’t think much of miss Reed and her unfortunate obsession, and whenever I did, I felt this uncomfortable chill in the pit of my stomach. Like I was a witness to something far worse than a mild delusion misleading a troubled person.

But notes about her faded. Memories too. Not that they were completely gone, but it’s like they’d been scrubbed out. I remembered her face as a pale gradient, and all details about her seemed misshapen and bent. It was like trying to remember the specifics of a particular tree in a forest; you remember general features, not specifics. You don’t count its branches.

But when I finally saw her again, it all came back to me.

 

It was late afternoon in early August. I was coming home from work, carrying a bag of groceries. I slipped the key into the lock, stepped inside, and paused for a moment. Had I actually turned the key? It felt like I hadn’t. But it couldn’t have been open already.

There was debris on the floor. Pieces of dirt and moss stuck on the carpet. There were drag marks, as if someone had pulled something heavy into the living room. But what really caught my attention was my cat, Romeo – or the lack thereof. Usually he tried to bolt out the door, but he wasn’t even peeking out to see what was going on this time. I called out to him, but I couldn’t hear his paws tip-tap in response.

I put down the groceries and looked around the corner into my bedroom. Nothing there. I stopped just short of rounding the corner into the living room and listened closely. There was some kind of noise. A rhythmic scratching, like nails against cheap plaster. I shivered as a voice snapped me out of my thoughts.

“You know how long it took to get here?”

The voice was familiar, but something was off. At first I didn’t recognize it. There was this low monotone quality to it, like listening to someone speak from behind a thin wall. When my memory finally clicked, all thoughts of miss Reed came flooding back.

“You need to make it all better,” she sobbed. “You have to fix this. You have to fix *me*.”

 

I wanted to peek around the corner, but there was something in me that didn’t want to. The scratches on the floor covered part of the far wall, and one of my paintings had fallen over and cracked. I could see the gleaming glass shards.

“How can I help?” I asked.

“You put this image in my head. I was not a person, and there was nothing there. But you put the *image* there, and everything *changed*. I need you to take it out. You need to take out… the image.”

“How can I do that? What can I say?”

“Just say I’m… strong! Or pretty! You can say whatever, just… tell me I’m not an *oak!*”

Something tapped against one of the living room windows as miss Reed sobbed. My breath trembled as my lips grew cold.

“Do you think that would help?”

There was a brief pause. There was a creaking sound as a weight shifted on my leather couch.

“No,” she sighed. “I suppose it wouldn’t.”

I closed my eyes and rounded the corner. I took a deep breath - and looked.

 

Miss Reed had closed the curtains, and the ceiling lamp had been torn down. A dying August light was still making its way in from the adjacent kitchen window, casting an orange silhouette of the living room. The place was a mess, like a hurricane had come and gone. And yet, in all that chaos, I could see Romeo sitting on her lap, purring his heart out and making biscuits.

“I want to be a person again,” miss Reed said. “I don’t want *this*. I want to choose.”

“It takes… work,” I said. “Hard work, over a long time. I can help.”

“No, you can’t. I’m not a *person* to you. Not a *person*, not a *patient*, not a *human*, not a…”

“Then what are you?” I interrupted. “What do you choose to be?”

“I didn’t *choose* *anything*. *You* did. You chose this *for* me!”

 

Romeo casually strolled out of her lap as miss Reed got up from the couch. Something long and white stretched out of her ribcage, tearing up the cheap living room wallpaper as she stood up. Her skin snapped and popped as she flexed her muscles, breaking apart at the seams. Her yellow toenails had broken into pieces, each section spreading out like a clutter of roots. I could hear the tapping as they poked against the coffee table.

She was tall. *Impossibly* tall. And her voice grew darker as she rose, as if her lungs had the sudden room to breathe.

“Get the image out,” she groaned. “Get the image out *now*.”

 

I ducked behind the kitchen island as an arm swept over me. It knocked over my coffee maker, my toaster, a rack of knives, and my kitchen towels. It all clattered to the floor. There was a growth branching off the edge of her wrist, getting tangled in the outer wisps of my unbrushed hair.

I kept close to the floor and hurried into the hallway. I could hear the lumbering footsteps behind me as something hard scratched against the wood. I ducked down and turned a sharp left as a large arm swept over me, knocking over a lamp and my grocery bag. I made it to the bedroom and slammed the door shut, but it bounced as something hard and wooden got in the way. I heard the crackle of a dry branch as something scattered on the ground. I only had a heartbeat to look, but I’ll never forget the image of well over a dozen human nails covering my bedroom floor.

She forced the door open as I dove over the bed and rushed into my closet. I closed it just as something massive slammed into it, breaking the top hinge and pressing me into the wall.

“I can’t be like this!” she shrieked. “I can’t be like this forever!”

Another push. A screw from the hinges pressed into the side of my temple, causing a warm streak of blood to pool down my face.

I had to do something. *Anything*.

 

“Imagine,” I wheezed. “Imagine you’re an oak.”

“…what?”

“Imagine you’re an oak,” I repeated. “Picture it.”

“…no.”

The pressure eased. I crouched down, covering the side of my head. I could feel the blood slipping through my fingers.

“Picture the branches,” I continued. “The bend at the bottom as the roots expand into the ground.”

“…no!”

“The wind rushing through your leaves. The rain soaking into your bark.”

She wasn’t even using words anymore. It was just this long, continuous shriek. She was trashing around my apartment, desperately swinging her arms around like a trapped wild animal. The scream grew louder and higher until I could no longer discern it from a howling wind.

“Imagine you’re an oak,” I repeated. “Imagine you’re an oak.”

I kept saying it over and over until the closet door collapsed. There were scrapes and cuts along the walls and floor. A couple of branches lay across the bedspread. Looking back at the bedroom door, I could see that there were no human nails; just acorns.

And all that remained of miss Reed was a shrieking wind coming through a broken window.

 

After a couple of days, I had forgotten all about miss Reed. I remembered it all as a fierce storm and an awful accident. I didn’t even question it. It’s not that I ignored that it happened, I just remembered it differently. I didn’t go looking for her. I didn’t call anyone about her. All I did was talk to my insurance company and get my place fixed up.

And for a long time, that’s how it’s been. I eventually moved out of South Dakota when I met my husband. I’m still seeing patients, and I did branch out into forensic psychology in later years. But not long ago, we made a trip back. I was going to see my half-brother in Rapid City when we stopped to stretch our legs. An eight-hour trip is no joke, especially when you got two impatient teenagers in the back seat.

As we stood there and my husband enjoyed a cigarette, I looked out on the open field. In the distance I saw this magnificent oak tree stretching out an immense crown of leaves. A couple of sunflowers rested underneath, mirroring the shade of its protector.

And something in me died as I realized they were all black, and blue.",3,1768614572.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Well that emergency recently came. A crown on my left molar cracked so I had to set up an appointment for a replacement.  The dentist replaced the crown and found a cavity in the tooth before it . So the left molar got a new crown and the tooth in front of it had a filling right before Thanksgiving 2025.

After the appointment the left molar with the new crown was hurting to the point it interfered with life and was hurting constantly. So I went in and they said I needed a root canal . So I got the root canal on 12/23/25 .

It’s now 1/16 and I cannot chew on the side of my mouth with  the dental work. The tooth that has the filling hurts anytime something hard, cold, or really anything else other than room temp applesauce touches it. And the left molar with the new crown and root canal gets to the touch. It doesn’t hurt when I have coffee or something cold and it doesn’t hurt constantly like before. But it does hurt when anything touches it , even my finger.

I really enjoy chewing freedom and a healthy mouth. What should I do next?

I haven’t called the dentist bc at this point there’s a concern about quality, I mean how can a filling tooth hurt and the crown/root canal? I picked this dentist bc he had over 500, 5 star reviews.

Heartbreak hits like a car crash in slow motion. Suddenly the version of you that existed inside that relationship is gone. What’s left is emptiness, confusion, and a terrifying question: who even am I now?

Saw way too many TikToks pushing quickfix revenge body culture or rebound advice that’s more about numbing pain than healing. This post is the opposite. Researched from actual science, books, therapy experts, and deep podcast convos that don’t sugarcoat it. If you’re sitting in the ashes trying to piece yourself back together, read this. You’re not broken. You’re just between versions.

Here’s what actually helps:

 Identity detachment is real, and it’s why heartbreak messes you up so bad. According to Dr. Guy Winch (TEDx talk, How to fix a broken heart), getting over someone activates the same neurochemical withdrawal patterns as addiction. You're not just grieving a person. You're grieving a constructed version of yourself that only existed with them. To move on, you have to build a new identity  from scratch.

 Get your story back. Psychologist Dan McAdams explains in The Redemptive Self that humans understand themselves through personal narratives. After heartbreak, your story feels like it ended in chapter 17. So write a new chapter. Literally. Journaling helps reframe pain into growth. A study in Psychological Science (Pennebaker et al.) found that expressive writing boosts emotional recovery and improves cognitive processing.

 Stop chasing closure. Start chasing curiosity. Closure is a myth. The podcast The Love Drive (by Shaun Galanos) argues that asking Why did this happen? often leads to obsession loops. Better question: What can I learn from this? Asking different questions flips your brain into growth mode instead of rumination.

 Rewire your habits, not just your heart. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman (Huberman Lab) says the fastest way to reprogram your brain is through novelty combined with effort. Think new gym routines, reading new genres, learning new skills. This isn’t just distraction  it’s neuroplasticity at work. You’re teaching your brain a new normal.

 Solo time isn’t loneliness, it’s data collection. Spending time alone right after heartbreak feels brutal, but it's essential. Dr. Esther Perel says alone time helps you discover what desires are truly yours. Not your ex’s. Not society’s. Yours. This is how you reclaim agency.

 Reconnect with microjoy. Studies from Harvard’s Positive Psychology group found that people who deliberately track small sources of delight  sunlight on the floor, warm coffee, random kindness  rebuild emotional resilience faster. Healing isn’t one big aha. It’s a thousand quiet moments.

 Don’t mistake numbness for healing. Getting over someone by numbing out with hookup culture or distractions might feel like progress, but it’s avoidance. Research from Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology shows emotional suppression delays recovery and deepens depression. Feel the feelings. Let them suck. They won’t kill you.

 Fall in love with learning, not people. Right after heartbreak, your brain craves connection. Feed it with ideas. New books. Podcasts. Deep convos. According to Atomic Habits by James Clear, identity is shaped by what you do consistently. So if you consistently feed your mind  not your ex’s socials  you become someone new.

Healing isn’t about going back to who you were. It’s about becoming someone you haven’t met yet. That version is already waiting. You just have to build it.

1qezfig,https://v.redd.it/tclus5bx8tdg1,Deactivated,"Hey guys I never knew one day. I will be here.  Am from a different country Black male 6'2"". I have been sparking for two years. The store is closer to me everyday I always wake up early in the morning heading to work and I see this walmart emoloyee (woman she is american white) everytime I come to pick an order. One day I decided to come close ( this is actually last year summer august 2025). As usual like am friendly and kind I approach her and wanted to complement how hardworking she is and to keep the discipline, I even complenented to her not so many young people like her are hardworking. She said thanks and I bid her good bye. The next day I see her since she is at the same spot parking I approached her and asked her if I could get her coffee she said no thank you. And I said ok I left then after few weeks on september I saw her and decided to say hello but she dint reponded she was in her car that time. I even honk my horn she did not definatley I knew she dint want to talk so I decided to leave her alone and never speak to her so that way she doesnt feel like I am crazy.

So yesterday I was at the parking lot waiting for orders. Honestly this week it has been really slow so I decided to stay at the lot waiting for orders. Suddenly the lady came to me saying that am sitting around the parking lot stalking her daughter. Like really!!

I dont even have criminal record like why should I stalk someone. ( as shown in video) she went and called the police one me, the cops came and investigated and I told them am working for spark I even showed them my app i am not stalking. They saw it and left no tickets, citation or arrest. They said they have nothing and left.

Today I woke up with my account deactivated. I have apealled and denied. Like so technically we are not even to have a regular conversation with walmart employee, so we cant be friends?

I spoke with the manager and I explained my situation and they said never approach anyone as far as reactivation it will be upto spark, thats what they said. I dont know what to do guys.. if she dint want to talk to me she should have politely let me know ... am not a stalker or a bad guy.",0,1768613863.0,Sparkdriver,71,0.36,False

1qezdba,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qezdba/every_year_on_my_birthday_i_receive_a_card_from/,"Every Year on my Birthday, I Receive a Card from Someone I Don’t Know ( Part 2)","I showed the desk officer the live video.

He didn’t interrupt me. He just watched the screen, jaw clenched, hands folded on the counter like he was bracing himself.

When it ended, he asked if this was live or a recording.

I handed him my phone and told him it was live and explained the situation as quickly as I could. They dispatched units immediately to my house.

They took me into a small interview room after that. No windows. Just a table, two chairs, and a faint humming sound I couldn’t place. A detective came in not long after, older, calm, the kind of guy who speaks slowly like he’s careful not to spook you.

I told him everything.

Not just what happened that night, but everything that led up to it. Every card. Every birthday. How long it had been going on. How I never told anyone because it always felt… harmless. Strange, sure. But harmless.

He asked why I hadn’t reported it sooner.

I told him my mother did once but nothing came of it. Other than that I didn’t have a good answer.

At some point it stopped feeling like something that happened to me and started feeling like something that had always just been there. Like background noise.

I remember sitting alone in that room, trying not to imagine someone walking through my front door.

When the detective came back, he closed the door behind him before he spoke.

“They didn’t find anything.” He said. “If it weren’t for that video it would be impossible to tell if anyone was there.”

No signs of forced entry. No disturbed ground outside. No footprints around the house, even near the door where the man had been standing. The officers checked the yard, the side of the house, the area near the fence line.

Nothing.

Inside, it was the same.

No fingerprints that didn’t belong there. No signs anyone had been inside recently. No evidence of tampering with the locks. 

One of the officers mentioned how clean it all was.

That word stuck with me.

Clean.

The detective told me that without anything physical to go on, there wasn’t much they could do right now. He said they’d file a report, keep it on record, and to call immediately if anything else happened.

I asked him if he thought I was in danger.

He paused longer than I liked before answering.

He said it was good I wasn’t going back to the house.

When I left the station, it was already getting light out.

I sat in my car for a minute before starting it, just breathing, letting the adrenaline burn itself out. That was when it really hit me that if I hadn’t checked my phone when I did… if I hadn’t seen the notification…

I called my girlfriend as soon as I pulled onto the road.

I told her everything. The video. The police. I didn’t try to downplay it this time. I told her exactly how scared I was.

She started crying before I finished.

I told her to stay where she was. She’d already gone to her parents’ place after I called her the night it happened. I told her not to come back to our place, not yet. I promised I’d explain everything again later, in person, somewhere safe.

Then I told her I was going to my mom’s house.

She asked me if I wanted her to come with me.

I told her no.

I didn’t want anyone else walking into whatever this was.

After I hung up, I tried calling my mom.

No answer.

I told myself she was asleep. It was early. Too early. I called again.

Still nothing.

I sent a text asking if she was home.

No response.

I don’t know how long I drove like that, one hand on the wheel, the other gripping my phone like it might start ringing if I held it hard enough. Every red light felt too long. Every car behind me felt too close.

Somewhere between the station and my mom’s house, it occurred to me that I hadn’t told the detectives everything.

Not because I was hiding anything.

But because there were things I’d never thought to question until people started asking.

I pulled into my mom’s driveway just as the sun was coming up.

Her car was there. Lights off. Curtains drawn.

I don’t remember knocking. I just remember standing on the porch, listening, suddenly aware of how quiet everything was. No TV. No footsteps. No movement inside.

I knocked again, harder this time.

After a few seconds, the door opened just enough for her to look out at me, eyes squinting like she was trying to place me somewhere she hadn’t expected.

She said my name before I could say hers.

The relief hit me all at once.

She asked what I was doing there so early. I told her I needed to come in. I told her something happened.

She stepped aside without asking questions.

She noticed my hands shaking before I did.

We sat at the kitchen table. She poured coffee I didn’t think I would touch. I told her about the man at the door. About the deliveries. About the key.

I expected surprise.

What I got was something else.

She didn’t interrupt me. She didn’t question me. She didn’t ask for details. She just listened, eyes fixed on the table, hands folded tightly in front of her.

When I finished, she let out a long breath, like she’d been holding it in for years.

She tried to remember when the first card arrived but couldn’t so she asked me.

I told her.

She nodded slowly.

She asked me if I’d ever thought about who it could be.

I told her what people were saying. About family. About my dad.

Her head snapped up at that.

She said his name quietly, like she didn’t want it to linger.

Then she said, “You know your father died before that, right?”

I told her I knew.

But the truth was, I’d never really thought about the timing.

He died when I was young. An accident. That’s all I ever remembered it being called. Something sudden. Something tragic. Something that happened and then stopped being talked about.

She confirmed it again, gently, like she was afraid I might argue.

He wasn’t around for my birthdays after that. He wasn’t sending cards. He wasn’t watching me grow up.

Whatever this was, it wasn’t him.

She reached across the table and took my hand. Her grip was tighter than usual.

She told me she didn’t think I should go back to the house yet.

I told her the detective had said the same thing.

That made her pause.

She asked what the police had said.

I told her everything they’d found.

Or rather, everything they hadn’t.

She went quiet again after that. Not panicked. Not emotional. Just… guarded.

I asked her if there was anything she wasn’t telling me.

She looked at me for a long time before answering.

She said no.

But she also said she didn’t think this was random.

I stayed at her place for a while. Long enough for the caffeine to kick in. Long enough for the adrenaline to wear off.

Eventually, reality crept back in.

I needed clothes. My work laptop. My charger. Things I hadn’t thought to grab when I left the house in the middle of the night.

My mom offered to come with me.

I told her I’d be fine.

I don’t know why I said that.

On the drive back, I kept thinking about the way the officers described the house.

Clean.

I parked down the block instead of in the driveway.

The house looked exactly the same as I’d left it. No lights on. No movement. No sign anyone had been there at all.

For a moment, I wondered if I’d imagined the whole thing.

I walked up the path, eyes scanning the yard, the porch, the door.

The welcome mat was slightly crooked.

I know that doesn’t sound like much.

But I always kept it straight.

I knelt down to fix it.

That’s when I saw what was underneath.

I stood there for a second, hand still on the edge of the welcome mat.

The house was quiet. No cars passing. No neighbors outside.

I crouched down and straightened the mat.

It resisted slightly.

That’s when I lifted it.

There was a folded piece of paper underneath, pressed flat against the concrete. It wasn’t damp. It wasn’t curled at the edges. It hadn’t been there long enough to collect dirt or moisture.

It had been placed.

My first thought was that the police had missed it, but that didn’t make sense. They’d stood on this porch. One of them had leaned against the door while the other checked the frame. If it had been there earlier, someone would’ve seen it.

Which meant it had been put there after.

I unfolded it just enough to see my name.

My phone rang.

The sound startled me so badly I nearly dropped both the note and the phone. I didn’t check the screen. I assumed it was my mom, or my girlfriend calling to ask if I’d made it inside okay.

I answered immediately.

“Hello?”

There was nothing on the other end.

No static. No background noise. Just an open line.

For a second, I thought the call had dropped.

I pulled the phone away from my ear and looked at the screen. The call was still connected but it was an unknown number.

I raised it back to my ear.

Still nothing.

Then he spoke.

“I see you found it.”

The voice was calm. Older. Male. Not rushed. Not excited. Like he’d waited until he knew I was listening.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. My mouth felt dry, like it had been stuffed with cotton.

There was a pause after that, long enough to feel deliberate.

“You shouldn’t have involved anyone else” he said.

Not angry. Not threatening. Just… corrective. The way someone talks when you’ve made a mistake they expected you to know better than to make.

“That complicates things.”

My heart was pounding hard enough that I could feel it in my throat. I asked him who he was, but the words came out weak, like I wasn’t sure I was allowed to ask.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he said, “You won’t do that again.”

It wasn’t framed as a warning. He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t tell me what would happen if I did.

He said it the way someone states a fact they consider settled.

There was another pause.

I waited for him to say more. For an explanation. For anything that would make this make sense.

He didn’t.

The call ended.

No click. No dial tone. Just gone.

I stood there on the porch with my phone still pressed to my ear, staring at the note in my other hand, suddenly aware of how exposed I was. How long I’d been standing there. How easy it would’ve been for someone to watch me without being seen.

I didn’t read the rest of the note.

I didn’t go inside.

I got back in my car and drove.

That was days ago.

Since then, I haven’t gone back to the house. I’ve been bouncing between hotels, sleeping with the lights on, keeping my phone on silent unless I’m expecting a call. I’ve turned off anything that tracks my location. I haven’t told anyone where I am unless I absolutely had to.

I keep replaying the call in my head.

Not what he said.

But how certain he sounded.

I went to the police because I thought that’s what you’re supposed to do when someone crosses a line.

Now I’m not sure there ever was one.

That’s why I’m writing this now.

Because whatever this is didn’t end that night.

And I don’t think it’s ever been as far in the past as I convinced myself it was.",5,1768613720.0,stories,4,1.0,False

Ever feel like retirement is some mythical creature—like a unicorn or a perfectly folded fitted sheet? You *know* it exists, but actually *seeing* it in your life? That’s another story.

Here’s the kicker: **You might already be way closer than you think.**

Most of us underestimate how much our savings could actually grow over time. A few hundred bucks a month? *Pfft*, that’s just coffee money, right? Wrong. Thanks to the magic of compound interest, that “coffee money” could turn into a full-blown espresso empire by the time you’re ready to retire.

### **How Your Savings Could Secretly Be a Retirement Powerhouse**
Let’s break it down—no finance degree required.

- **The Latte Effect (But Make It Smart)**
  Skip *one* $5 latte a day, invest it instead, and at a 7% return? That’s **$70K+ in 20 years**. (Yes, your future self just high-fived you.)

- **The “I’ll Start Later” Trap**
  Waiting 10 years to save that same $5/day? You’d need to stash away **double** the amount to catch up. Time is your BFF here—don’t ghost it.

- **The “But I Don’t Make Enough” Myth**
  Even $100/month can grow into **$100K+** over a few decades. The key? *Starting now*, not when you “have more.”

### **The Sneaky Way to See Your Real Retirement Potential**
Most of us guess how much we’ll need—then panic. But what if you could **actually see** how your current savings stack up?

*You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.* **[Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb)** *(Heads up: That’s my affiliate link—if you click, I might earn a small commission at no cost to you!)*

### **The Bottom Line?**
Retirement isn’t about having a perfect plan—it’s about **starting before you feel “ready.”** That $20 you tossed into savings last month? It’s not just $20. It’s a seed. And seeds have a funny way of growing into trees… if you let them.

So tell me: What’s *one* small change you could make today to give your future self a high-five? (No pressure—just food for thought.) 🚀",1,1768613611.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1. What is the significance of this cop bringing coffee? Why show it?

  
2. The cop is refusing the idea of black on black killing, which could also be him. Well most black people had this attitude but still.

  
3. Holden looks at him suspiciously at the end of the scene. Or maybe it just felt like it.

Hey everyone! 👋

I’ve been working out for a few years and tried a lot of fitness apps.

Some are good for workouts but bad for nutrition.

Others are good for food tracking but weak for workouts.

And many charge way too much 💸

So I decided to build my own app that does everything I actually need.

After many late nights and lots of coffee ☕ I finally released it on the Play Store.

The app is called Light Weight 💪

Play Store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.basheerrjoub.lightweight

Workout features 🏋️‍♂️

Log sets, reps, and weights

Large exercise library with clear instructions

Pre-built workout programs

Progress tracking so you can see your gains 📈

Food tracking 🍽️

Calorie and macro tracking

AI food scanner, just point your camera at food and log it 📷🤖

Save meals so you don’t re-enter the same food every day

Other features 💧

Water tracking reminders

Weight and body measurement tracking with charts

Achievement system to stay motivated 🏆

I know there are a lot of fitness apps out there, but I really focused on making this one useful and easy to use.

I’d love for you to try it and share feedback 🙏

What’s missing

What needs improvement

What you actually like

I’m actively developing it and want to make it better.

Happy to answer any questions! 😊

Hey everyone! 👋

I’ve been working out for a few years and tried a lot of fitness apps.

Some are good for workouts but bad for nutrition.

Others are good for food tracking but weak for workouts.

And many charge way too much 💸

So I decided to build my own app that does everything I actually need.

After many late nights and lots of coffee ☕ I finally released it on the Play Store.

The app is called Light Weight 💪

Play Store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.basheerrjoub.lightweight

Workout features 🏋️‍♂️

Log sets, reps, and weights

Large exercise library with clear instructions

Pre-built workout programs

Progress tracking so you can see your gains 📈

Food tracking 🍽️

Calorie and macro tracking

AI food scanner, just point your camera at food and log it 📷🤖

Save meals so you don’t re-enter the same food every day

Other features 💧

Water tracking reminders

Weight and body measurement tracking with charts

Achievement system to stay motivated 🏆

I know there are a lot of fitness apps out there, but I really focused on making this one useful and easy to use.

I’d love for you to try it and share feedback 🙏

\- the opening between the sink and fridge is my access to the basement, so it is immovable.

\- the oven could go on the wall that has the fridge, however, then new venting has to be installed. 

\- the only piece of exterior wall that would fit a 30” range + vent is to the left of sink. So oven pretty much can’t go anywhere else. 

\- yes that weird bump by the oven is part of my floor plate.

Senator Bam Aquino took a nostalgic look back at his time on *Breakfast*, a youth-oriented morning show that aired on Studio 23 in the early 2000s, emphasizing the importance of platforms that empower young people.

In his statement, Aquino described *Breakfast* as a show where news, pop culture, and issues relevant to the youth could be openly discussed. He stressed that programs like these play a vital role in building young people’s confidence to join conversations, ask questions, and think critically, similar to the goals of initiatives such as #YSpeak.

“Shows like these give young people a voice and the confidence to engage,” Aquino said, adding that he hopes to see more spaces today where the youth can freely express their ideas and perspectives.

Aquino also gave a shoutout to his former co-hosts and colleagues on *Breakfast*, thanking them for the conversations, laughter, and early mornings they shared. Ending on a light note, he joked that they now need more coffee than ever, and seem to get sleepy much earlier than they used to.

I’m someone who keeps life pretty simple and prefers depth over noise. I’m not the loudest person in the room and I’m completely fine with that. I warm up best in one on one conversations where there’s room to actually think, joke, and be yourself without performing.

My schedule isn’t the typical nine to five, which can be unpredictable but also means I’m around at odd hours and down for spontaneous conversations. When the seasons are warmer, I spend as much time as I can outside exploring trails, paddling on the water, camping, or just enjoying fresh air. Colder months usually mean slowing things down with a book, a solid cup of coffee, a good series, and calm nights in.

I’m not chasing intensity or expectations. I’m here for easy conversations, shared humor, thoughtful exchanges, and the kind of connection that develops naturally. Friendship is the goal, and if it becomes something ongoing, even better.

If you appreciate quiet personalities, meaningful conversations, and someone who’s comfortable with both talking and silence, feel free to reach out.",2,1768612921.0,IntrovertsChat,1,1.0,False

I've been new to la Santa muerte for a couple of months now and have been wanting to give her better offerings like food or coffee. I gave her coffee which she seemed to like, but I'm never sure for how long to keep the coffee on her altar for because I end up feeling bad whenever her coffee gets cold and I throw it out. I do let her know why I'm throwing it out each time though as to not accidentally offend her. The same goes for alcohol, I gave her wine and about two days later I saw a nat in there.


As for the food, I cook sometimes and I want to give her some food as well because I don't want to leave her out, especially since her altar is in front of the kitchen, but I'm never sure for how long you're supposed to leave food on there and I'm also worried about attracting bugs. 


Would any of you have any advice on how you do it? Much appreciated and I hope everyone is having a great Friday!🖤💀",5,1768612887.0,SantaMuerte,1,0.86,False

This time I spent 3 nights and was mostly solo (I could meet up with a group that I knew would be there, but I mostly ran around on my own).

**Hotel Saint Vincent:** loved. I chose the smallest room and it was great for one person. Loved staying in the lower Garden District. The bar was small and really nice.

**La Petite Grocery:** lovely atmosphere, delicious. Get the pickle jar!

**Commander's Palace:** celebrated with a friend and they put balloons at our table and gave us fun paper hats to wear. We loved the food and the service. I had a pecan encrusted fish. Delicious. Such a fun night.

**Voodoo Tour with High Priest Robi:** he was so charming and charismatic and I learned a lot! This was so fun and informative, I highly recommend it!

**Cafe du Monde:** okay, glad I went. I just had the coffee.

**Napoleon's:** more about seeing the space than the food. I don't remember what I ate but I tried the Pimm's Cup. It was nice.

**Two Chicks Walking:** Garden District Tour. Loved this. I learned so much about history, architecture, and local celebrities. Highly recommend.

**Acamaya:** Ate dinner solo at the bar. It was delicious and a fun atmosphere.

**WW2 Museum:** This wasn't on my list but several people told me it was not to be missed. I'm glad I went. My favorite exhibits were the Homefront and the Degenerate Art exhibits. I spent about 3 hours here and saw both movies. Very well done.

**Peche:** If I could repeat one meal, this would be it. I sat at the bar, had some catfish in broth dish and drum with coconut rice balls. Amazing. I'm still thinking about it!

**Reading at Bottom of the Teacup:** Good touristy fun.

**Jack Rose:** Went for dinner with a group. It was festive but the food wasn't my favorite.

**Treme Tour with French Quarter Phantoms:** Loved. Again, very educational and interesting.

**Mojo Coffee Shop:** Across from Hotel Saint Vincent. Very popular. They make delicious King Cake lattes.

**NOLA Mix:** record store across from Hotel Saint Vincent. Very cool.

I adored New Orleans and can't wait to go back! What a beautiful and friendly city. It really has it all: art, magic, history, music, food, fun. Next time the focus will be music and more food. I missed Audubon Park, Algiers Point, and I didn't walk around the French Quarter or the Bywater enough. I'll also take advantage of the streetcar more.
