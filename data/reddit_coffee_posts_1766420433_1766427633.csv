1pt6pnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1pt6pnx/having_no_friends_as_a_girl_puts_you_in_an/,Having no friends as a girl puts you in an impossible loop,"I’m honestly fed up. I’m 19 and kind of in an awkward phase of my life where I’m taking a break from college (for medical reasons… another story) and so I’m stuck in my hometown, but no longer in contact with my high school friends. They’re all away at school. 

So naturally, I do not have a strong social life right now. I crave having girls to hang out with and honestly mainly just miss having events to go to on special occasions, like Christmas or New Year’s Eve. I came to rant because I realized that I will be home alone on NYE because my parents are actually invited to a party.

What puts me in this position where I’m struggling to even meet people is that why as girls do we need to already have friends to make friends? I am literally trying to put myself out there and meet new people but it’s like people smell my lonely aura and get scared away. 

I went to a “meet new people” event that a coffee shop was hosting the other week and, surprise, not more than 10 or 12 people showed up. The kicker? Every single person there actually came with a friend or a group. I was the only person who showed up alone. It shouldn’t have even surprised me that everybody who did come was notably older than me (in 30s) and so all the people I did talk to treated me like I was weird or strange for showing up to such an event as a 19 year old. 

Does anybody have any advice for me on where to actually find friends my age? Things that aren’t just go to place XYZ and try to be social with people. If that worked by now, I should’ve had way more friends, but the issue is you need to show up to these places with friends in order to not look like a weirdo.

Life moves fast enough, and I think the best things come when they are allowed to unfold naturally.

I’m a dentist by profession, but outside of work, I like to stay busy in other ways. I’ve got a couple of energetic puppies who keep me on my toes, and I love baking or trying new recipes in the kitchen. I’m also someone who needs to be active, so you’ll usually find me out running, hiking, or hitting the gym. But I’m just as content finding a quiet corner in a coffee shop or getting lost in a good conversation over dinner. I travel whenever I can and enjoy exploring new places, whether it’s a new city or a hidden gem in the countryside.

What I’m really looking for is someone who shares a similar mindset. I’m drawn to people with emotional maturity, intelligence, and kindness, people who can appreciate a good laugh, but also know how to hold deeper conversations. I appreciate those who enjoy the little things, like a calm afternoon or a good meal, but who also have the curiosity and drive to experience more and embrace new challenges. I like being around those who have their own sense of elegance, but who also don’t take themselves too seriously.

I think good company and a strong connection are the foundation of anything meaningful. I’m not looking for anything forced or rushed, but more like a natural bond that could evolve over time. No pressure, just two people enjoying each other’s presence and seeing where it leads.

If you are someone who appreciates this kind of easygoing, but intentional connection and is open to the idea of building something with time, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me something you are passionate about, or share a place you’ve always wanted to visit. Looking forward to connecting.",1,1766427453.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1pt6pay,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1pt6pay/personalmoral_dilemma/,Personal/moral dilemma,"Sorry in advance for the overly long post, need to set the scene.

Been in the industry for 25 years, worked everything from fast casual to fine dining, dishes, saute, all the way to exec and GM, it's the only thing I know.  A few years ago I left the industry and moved into grocery management in an attempt to save my failing marriage (spoiler alert: it did not work out).

A couple years after I get an offer that seems perfect. KM for a small, locally based, brunch chain that was expanding into my metro area. I describe the food as ""bougie white lady brunch"".  Great money, great hours, so I pull the trigger and jump back into the kitchen.

I help this group open two locations starting from the ground up. Meaning actually building equipment, setting up vendors, hiring staff, the whole yard. First location was physically a difficult space to make work, honestly just an awful spot to try and work a fully functional kitchen into but we make due. The GM and I have a great relationship and see eye to eye but the staff was a hot mess on both sides.

After four months I phase out of my position there to focus on getting the second location up and running. Exact opposite of the former, my kitchen staff was fucking amazing (FOH not so much), but the 25 year old GM was awful. She was hired due to her family being close with one of the higher ups and openly admitted that she got her only previous management experience because she slept with the owner of that restaurant.

Shit immediately hits the fan and she cuts and runs, leaving me to manage both sides alone for a couple months before they bring in a new GM.

One week after the new GM arrives she sits me down to tell me that ""things just aren't working out and she doesn't see a place there for me anymore"" AKA we don't want to pay your salary anymore.  Mind you this is one week after I turned 40, first time I've ever been fired, and two weeks before Thanksgiving. So of course no restaurant is highering for upper management in the thick of the holidays. I ended up unemployed for over three months before I sucked down my pride and crawled back to the grocery store.

Three weeks after my firing my old lead line cook calls me to tell me that the GM that fired me just got fired for filling her coffee mug up with vodka from the bar.

Here's the kicker, she just got hired part time at the store, where I am in management, in the beer and wine department.  I feel like I have an obligation to tell my store manager that we have just hired an alcoholic who has previously been caught drinking on the job, but I'm worried with our past history it could turn into some sort of HR issue, retaliation or what not.  I also hate this lady because she ruined my life for a few months now, and ruined my passion for kitchens.

How should I handle this, or do I just ignore her existence?",1,1766427430.0,KitchenConfidential,0,1.0,False

I haven’t found many places to ask for help in tracking down a bowl like the one pictured.  Clearly it is broken, and that broke my partners heart.  A spice jar fell out of the cabinet on it.  

In my search for a replacement, I have found that they were made in at least 3 sizes - small (4.5”), medium (6”), and large (7”) - this being the medium size of around 6” in diameter and about 2.5” tall.  I see only the small and large versions for sale at the moment.

At the very least, if someone can translate the kanji on the bottom (which I hope can identify the manufacturer) that would be extremely helpful.

So I left in the middle of a critical server migration.","**Background:** I work as a backend developer for a mid-sized logistics company. Recently, we got a new manager, let's call him ""Dave"". Dave wants to cut costs to impress the upper management.

Last week, Dave called a meeting and screamed at us about ""unauthorized overtime"". He stated that effective immediately, **nobody** is allowed to work a single minute past 5:00 PM without a written pre-approval signed by him 24 hours in advance. He explicitly said: ""If I see you at your desk at 5:01 PM, you're getting a formal warning. Three warnings and you're fired.""

We tried to explain that IT sometimes requires emergency fixes. He didn't care. ""Management is about planning. If you can't finish by 5, you're bad at planning."" Okay, Dave.

**The Incident:** Yesterday was ""Migration Day"". We were moving a massive database to a new cloud environment. It's a delicate process. I started the script at 2:00 PM, expecting it to finish by 4:00 PM.

Of course, at 4:45 PM, the script hit a critical error. The database was in a ""zombie state"" — neither here nor there. The system was offline. Customers couldn't log in.

To fix it, I needed to manually rollback the changes and restart the sync. A process that takes about 45 minutes.

I looked at the clock. It was 4:58 PM.

I looked at Dave's office. He was already gone (ironic).

I remembered his threat: *""At 5:01 PM you get a formal warning.""*

So, I typed a quick email to Dave: ""Current status: Database corrupted, system offline. Per your policy regarding strictly no overtime without 24h prior written approval, I am leaving now. Will resume fixing this at 9:00 AM tomorrow.""

I shut down my laptop and walked out at 5:00 PM sharp.

**The Aftermath:** My phone started blowing up at 5:30 PM. Then at 6:00 PM. Then the CEO called. I didn't answer. I’m off the clock, right?

I came in this morning to chaos. The company had lost about $40k in orders overnight because the system was down. Dave looked like he hadn't slept. He tried to blame me, but I pulled up *his* email about the ""Zero Tolerance Overtime Policy"" and forwarded it to the CEO.

Dave is currently in a meeting with HR. I'm drinking my coffee and fixing the database. It took 30 minutes.",41,1766427318.0,MaliciousCompliance,9,0.92,False

My grandmother used to save it in a coffee can and reuse it then store it in the garage like I said, but now that everyone is using pods there’s no coffee cans and I don’t have anything comparable that’s food safe. So what am I supposed to do with this stuff?

Stella: Mitchell dearie what do you think of these chocolate chip cookies?

Stella: Excellent take them all!!

Ever since I worked at that certain coffee place (not naming it but its def not starbucks) my mental health and sense of identity were pretty much void. Furthermore its even worse that my managers are family-friends with my family because they told my family almost everything and in return vice-versa kinda I mean i didnt mind it at first but it got to a point especially my cousin, who wouldnt keep her mouth shut about where Im trying to apply to around my manager. 

In general working there has been a nightmare its like being in a dystopian torture ritual; my manager and sometimes even my co workers would yell on my face anytime I did a mistake and my manager would go along with my co-workers, and most of the time when you make a mistake they take over your work and scorn you. customers? They get aggressive at you if you mess up or keep insisting on something when you ran out of it, or better yet yell at you to make their coffee when there are 30 people in the line and you're the only person there at the moment and if its morning shift your manager enables them and blames you for it when most of the time its not your fault. 

My manager even threatened to make me pay and cut my paycheck for making a mistake and just this thanksgiving I had a mental breakdown bc I thought she was gonna make me pay for the food and stuff i didnt finish home and the mistakes too  if she checked the cameras because of an incident that happened in another store that involved stealing money upper-management decided to hire someone to check cctv footage every shift or smth like that and when my manager talked to me about the new protocol I freaked out and my family went all furious to my manager telling them that it was a misunderstanding (tbf tho yeah its my problem i stole food but i didnt steal money) 

Last week was my breaking point bc I realized that if I stayed in this job any longer I would end up like my miserable co workers anytime soon and maybe end up worse in time because of my already occuring thoughts that worsened so today I sent my manager a text that i will not be coming back and blocked the number. I dont care if she tries to get my family to get me to come back I dont care anymore I have put myself first and thats final.

Lesson of the day to anyone my age: Dont work at a place where the people know your family because trust me they'll treat you just as worse

Asking around local shops, it seems that only about 5% of customers are asking for decaf.  What are you seeing?

Most shops have a smaller grinder loaded with decaf.  Do you have any issue with the decaf beans going stale, either in the grinder or in the bag?

Some shops say customers ask for “half-caf”.  The baristas tell me they manually dose caf and decaf into the basket and make do with the results.  Are you doing half-caf, if so how?

Apologies for all these questions.  We are starting a coffee shop and are hoping to “strip down” the menu and options to “just the basics”.  For example, one place I go to has just one size of to-go cup and they seem to be doing fine.

Knee feels stiff and swollen. Pain meds feel confusing. Unsure if you’re icing or elevating the right way.

If you’ve had (or are about to have) a total knee replacement and keep wondering “Is this normal?” — you’re not alone. These are the most common post-op concerns I hear every single day as a nurse.

That’s why I created this Total Knee Replacement Recovery Guide — to remove the guesswork and help you feel organized, informed, and confident during recovery.

This guide directly answers the questions patients stress about most:

✔️ Sleep problems after surgery — what’s normal and how to improve it

✔️ Pain & stiffness — what to expect week by week

✔️ Swelling management — how to ice and elevate correctly (and how often)

✔️ Medication tracking — so doses aren’t missed or doubled

✔️ Getting back to normal activity — realistic timelines, not false promises

✔️ Daily symptom trackers (pain, swelling, stiffness, bowel habits, mobility)

✔️ Exercise & PT logs to track ROM, walking distance, stairs, and strength

✔️ Red-flag symptoms & exactly when to call your surgeon

✔️ Mental health support for anxiety, frustration, and post-op depression

✔️ NEW 4-page progress log so you can see your improvement

✔️ Pre-op & post-op checklists to keep everything organized

**Why this works:**

**Recovery is harder when you don’t know what’s normal. This guide keeps everything in one place so you’re not guessing, panicking over swelling, or trying to remember what PT or your surgeon said last week. Gives you tips and tricks we use at the hospital!** 

**Perfect for:**

• Anyone preparing for knee replacement

• Post-op patients wanting structure and reassurance

• Caregivers supporting recovery

• People who want clarity instead of confusion

I made this because I see daily how much smoother recovery goes when patients have the right tools — and fewer unanswered questions. Only the price of two coffees, 9.99.

About a year ago, my wife and I visited CatCafe Lounge in LA for the first time. We both had heard about them but weren't really sure what the big deal was. Walked in, grabbed some wand toys, and... okay, I got it immediately. It's just different when you can have a coffee and actually hang out with cats. No pressuring anyone to adopt, just coffee, playtime and cuddles.

What really got us though was learning that CatCafe Lounge is non-profit and has helped over 2,000 cats get adopted since 2018. Every cat there was a rescue. That's when we realized these places aren't just cool hangouts, they're actually doing serious rescue work while letting people have amazing cat experiences. We left that day knowing we wanted to adopt a rescue cat ourselves.

Fast forward a year and we're scrolling through the Pasadena Humane Society and we see this kitten. Her name was Pickle (found with another kitten named Dill, so yeah, Dill Pickle. The shelter staff had jokes). She was a lynx point Siamese with these striking blue eyes, but her shelter photo showed... well, it was rough. Ringworm, patchy fur, fleas, severe sinus infection. Honestly, I think people were overlooking her because of how she looked in that photo.

We did not hesitate. We wanted to give her a chance when others weren't. She was coming home with us.

The first few weeks were a lot. Daily antibiotics, a little pink recovery suit, constant sneezing. But she trusted us from day one. Curled up on our laps even when she was uncomfortable, just purring. Fast forward to now, full recovery, sleek coat, absolute menace who demands attention at 5am, and somehow became the mascot for this whole directory thing that came next (see her transformation in the pictures above).

After our experience, I got a little obsessed with cat cafes and ended up building a directory of 332 of them across the US, Canada, and UK. I wanted to help people find ones that partner with rescues for adoptions. You can check it out at [cafewithcat.com](https://cafewithcat.com/) if you're curious.

Honestly though, whether you use the site or not, I just want to encourage anyone reading this to actually visit a cat cafe if you get the chance. It's a fun hangout and the visits help fund rescue work.",9,1766426094.0,rescuecats,1,1.0,False

I WANT TO MAKE THIS SPECIAL FOR HER, especially since she can’t see family (they live 4 hours away). Please please, what are some things I could do to make it seem more like Christmas for her? 

I had plans of making us homemade dinner, baking cookies together, watching Christmas movies but I feel like those are pretty basic & I want outside opinions on others things I could do/plan for us?

It might seem like a small thing to someone else, but to me it felt like a huge win. I even treated myself to a little snack and gave myself a proper pat on the back. It reminded me that celebrating your own efforts, even the little ones, can make a real difference in your mood and motivation.

Have you ever had a moment like this, where you just needed to celebrate yourself, even for something that seems minor to others?",5,1766425889.0,CasualConversation,4,1.0,False

She doesn't cook much; she's getting by on leftovers and takeout. 

She won't live in an ALF, and I understand they are not great and very expensive. However, she seems to expect all of us in her network to come over at least once per week and share a (large) meal with her. 

What's been occurring lately is that she is over-ordering food and even groceries. When I or a few others come, she insists over and over for us to eat and take seconds or thirds. Upon leaving, there's still too much food that she ordered. She insists we take it all home and gets quite upset if we do not do this. Admittedly, I cannot eat everything I take home and have to throw a lot of it away - many times it's unhealthy takeout and I am trying to keep my weight and cholesterol down. I have told her this many times and she ignores that. 

I have tried to convince her that ordering so much is a waste of money that she says she needs. I also feel a lot of ""Catholic guilt"" for wasting food; and no one really wants to share these leftovers with me when I get home; the neighbor thinks I will be distributing these leftovers when I've said many times that no, so-and-so will not eat this stuff. 

I have tried to buy the food for our meetings, or said ""let's just do coffee"" and she won't have it.

I am 21 and spent my whole life either with my violent bio family who would allow men in their 50s to SA me and then my step dad would b#et me for being a h...e. For 2 years I stayed with my aunt who was a very cold person and had her own kids but at least she would make sure I go to school and I have clean clothes. I live in a western country so I know this might sound surprising but no one really cared. Well, Eastern Europe.

I was SA multiple times between 13 and 17. At 18 I found a job at a night club and dated the owner who was 39 and would treat me so bad that I ended up in hospital a few times. After 3 attempts at ending this... lets call it life, I gave myself another chance.

At 21 I found a job at an energy plant canteen. I was approached in my first weeks by a senior engineer. A guy who is 36. He was good looking, well read and he was interested in me. I wasn't really but I struggle to say no to people. He was never nice to me but he wasn't physically absive so I was like... ok, this is fine.

I live in a dormitory right now and I used to spend nights at his place. He is mean to me and mocks me for my past and tells my my mother didn't love me. I have a psychologist assigned to me by the state, as they have me in evidence. I wouldn't afford one. One night this guy went very very hard on me. I was crying and biting the pillow and shaking. After he was done I couldn't breath. I had a panic attack. And he laughed and said oh c mon, kitten, based on all you told me, you can take way worse than this. I said I had it worse when he insisted. And he wanted me to tell him what happened worse and I couldn't. I started crying and he said I am way too sensitive for this world.

I told my therapist/psychologist (not even sure what she is) and she told me: don't you feel like you are overeacting? Did you tell him he is hurting you? I didn't. I was scared and I was screaming out in pain. And she was like hmm... hmmm. Oh! I see... hm. Did you tell him to stop? No, I didn't.

So how could he have assumed you don't like it? I told her what he told me after it was done. And she said: You should have an open conversation with him. I said I don't want to see him ever again. I avoid him at work and I am scared when I see him after this. And she said its just trauma response and I need to overcome it. Before him I was better. I started drawing and was good at it. Some of my drawing were selected to be exposed at an elementary school. And he ripped them before I could send them and told me he is keeping my feet on the ground. I am not talented. They just pitied me. It wasn't a big deal. I drew a family of rabbits around a Christmas table and stray dogs getting presents and food from angels during Christmas. And when we saw a bride on the streets he told me I will never be someone's wife myself. Also, when someone closer to my age, an engineer, 26 years old, gave me a flower on my birthday and wanted to go out for a coffee, he said the guy just wants to use me as he would never date a former night club girl. I told my therapist all this and she is like: but did you tell him this hurts you? I said I did. But he didn't stop.

At home I have a pretty decent espresso setup (Mazzer Philos + LM Mini). But I spend a ton of time at my partner's house, and they don't have any espresso equipment. They do have a kettle, though. I primarily like milk drinks and medium-dark roast coffees.

  
The problem is that it's a small apartment, and I cannot take up any of the counter space. So everything would need to live in a box that I can keep in the closet or somewhere.

  
Also, ideally from ""hey I want a latte"" to everything being clean and back in the box should be no more than 15-20 minutes. 

  
Do you all have any suggestions? I've been considering setups focused on travel like the flair go, outin mino, or picopresso. For grinding I'm assuming that a small handgrinder is going to be the best bet. 

  
For milk steaming I'm not sure at all. Frothing wand? Stovetop steamer?

He was bragging about the 5000w electric bicycle motor and how fast it could go, and my first thought was whether that was even legal. His enthusiasm was contagious at first. He described the acceleration and power with this gleam in his eye. But as we talked, I noticed something. He hadn’t actually used it much for the commuting he’d originally planned. The bike was too powerful for bike paths with other cyclists. Too heavy and fast for casual neighborhood rides. Yet not quite street legal as a motorcycle. It existed in this weird regulatory gray area.

This whole situation illustrated a problem I’d seen with lots of consumer products. Manufacturers compete on specifications, pushing numbers higher whether it makes practical sense or not. More watts, more speed, more power became marketing points completely disconnected from actual use. My neighbor had bought impressive specs but compromised usability. I’d been researching electric bikes for my own commuting needs. His experience was a wake up call about focusing on appropriate power rather than maximum power. A 750 watt motor would handle everything I needed while remaining legal and practical. Higher power just created complications without real benefits.

We talked about it over coffee, and he admitted the purchase was more about excitement than careful thought. Now this expensive bike mostly sat unused.

1pt5r2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pt5r2r/i_have_been_experiencing_discomfort_on_my_calf/,I have been experiencing discomfort on my calf for a long while now. What could it be?,"46M, \~1.70 tall, average weight.

I have been experiencing discomfort on my right lower leg on the calf. Most often on the upper right side of the calf, sometimes in the middle just below the knee or just above the heel, but never the entire calf all at once. Left leg seems fine, it's bothered me too but not as much and not any lately.

I sense it like a stiffness, tiredness or tenderness. Sometimes it is mildly painful, not enough to slow me down any but enough to distract me. I haven't been able to figure out what triggers it. Sometimes it's when I walk, sometimes it's when I sit...I just don't know. But it does seem to trigger when I walk uphill.

My foot and my knee also used to hurt. My foot around the ankle and before the toes. But these got all better since some time and now it's only the calf that bothers me anymore. I also used to wake up in the morning with my leg feeling stiff but that hasn't happened for some time now.

Rarely I get muscle spams but not just there, but on both legs and arms and my face, so I don't know if this is related.

I have no swelling, redness or any discoloration, no soft or hard lump or bump either, not just on my calf but anywhere on my body, and I have suffered no injury.

This has been going on for four months now. Within the first month since the symptoms started, I went to have some tests.

These included a D-Dimer which came back normal and I hope to God this is enough to rule out DVT. Please, tell me it is. X-Rays on lower back which seem to be normal since no one told me anything, and generally I feel like I have a bad back which bothers me often for many years now. I also had reason to suspect my kidneys may be at fault but relevant tests came back normal. I had a slight Vitamin D deficiency (29.8 when normal values were 30-100) and I don't think that's the culprit. I am also not diabetic.

Since those tests seemed good, as the doctor told me, I tried to work my own way out of it.

First I tried to take it easy and take vitamins too. Then I switched to electrolytes and these seemed to have eliminated the symptoms altogether for quite some time. Then I stopped using them because I was worried of side effects and then I suffered a setback. One morning I had to run some few hundred meters to catch a bus, and the next few days the shins of both legs were hurting a lot, to the point that it was a torture to walk. That pain gradually went away but the discomfort on the calf came back.

Then I started doing long walks and cut back on coffee too. I walk 5-6 kilometers at least couple of times a week. I seem to improve again but I have both good and bad days. On good days it's barely noticeable and bad days when it bothers me for many hours continuously.

And then came the day. In the evening before I have bought myself the best sleeping bag, best flashlight and about 20 tablet packs, undressed my Kerfur, turned it off, stored the clothes and put the Kerfur in the main room locker, filled my inventory with Molotovs, cooked fish, coffee chocolate and medications and went to sleep. Contrary to what I was expecting, nothing woke me up at 00:00, so I got up myself, got a signal and went back into the Stolas' embrace.

The event started at about 2:00, waking me up. I immediately rushed up to the roof of the bedroom and started throwing Molotovs at the boars. As soon the only boar I could see was the one stuck in the inaccessible room above the garage, I started thinking about celebrating the victory. However, I wasn't prepared for what came next. After killing the boar in the inaccessible room (you still can light it on fire with a well placed Molotov) I checked the Meta Paranoia and it was still going on, so I went down to check the radar. Looking at the radar, i noticed that there still were many boars, just outside the immediate vicinity, so I went after the closest one. I ran up to it and after aggroing it, led it to the closest fence, climbed onto the fence and started shooting the boar from an almost absolute safety (boars still can get you sometimes if the fence is on a slope, like around the tree test area).
I was thinking of simply mopping up the other boars after being done with this one, but as soon as the boar exploded, I was quite unpleasantly surprised to see it immediately respawning in the parking lot. After killing a few more boars respawning around the base, I went to the base roof and decided to read some posts about this event. Having read about this event ending in the evening, I simply went to the everyday work, including fixing the transformers and getting reports. However, when the time for the event to end passed and the event continued, I started worrying, but waited further until almost the midnight.
Just before midnight, not wanting to deal with Krampus (the brew jar I have placed at the entrance a few days before was flung by the boar explosions and I had no time to make a new one), I debug srape'd the Meta Paranoia, saved the game and went to sleep. After waking up, I went to kill a few more boars and after they respawned again, I have reloaded the save.

Turns out, not only the boars were saved, but to get rid of the respawning, I had to reload the game again, especially after losing the pistol and the hot sauce (""Cocktail of peace and fire"" which works really well for lighting the boars on fire when you are on the fence, better than the lighter, which has limited range) to the most gluttonous beast the Dr. Nose possibly ever created (the frigging snowy terrain, aided by the boar explosion blast radius being equal to that of the Tsar Bomb and accidentally pressing the ""R"" for too long resulting in the item being dropped) and only then the boars stopped respawning.

The rest was really simple, all I had to do was to complete the daily tasks, killing the boars I met on my way (in the end, I wasn't even climbing anywhere to shoot them, I was simply walking to the side, keeping the boar in the sights and shooting it nonstop as it slowly circled after me, unable to attack me) and in two days there were no boars on the map, which marked the end of the event and, by extension, the story campaign for me.

If you want to buy via friends & family Venmo or PayPal, it would be cheaper but I’d have to look into shipping. Posh covers the overcharge ship and it comes out to like $25-30 for the oversized box. Otherwise I’d have to split into two boxes and ship would likely be around $40, but you’d save 20% for the seller fees. Thanks! Considering tax and the 20% seller fee I have to tack on, def cheaper to go outside of Poshmark. I have references if you’d like to see. Thanks! ",4,1766425190.0,pusheen,0,1.0,False

Dating apps don’t work (for me) and asking women to date in public can be very nuanced and difficult. I’m basically going on 6 years single and the loneliness in crippling me. I’ll get to my point but I wake up alone in my bed before work on the verge of tears because all I want is a wife and I can’t even get a coffee date. i recently went to my local clothing-free hot spring and spent a night with one of the popular gay dudes there and literally I passed out. I didn’t even fuck I was so starved of intimacy that I fell asleep as he rubbed my shoulders. The crazy part is I know countless straight guys that literally get laid or even just share physical connection with fellow humans once a year, maybe a hug from mom or a cousin and that’s it. Why is it like this? I see no alternative if I want to be in a happy relationship. It seems gay dudes are very friendly and offer better friendship/company than women? Am i wrong?

Will be down after Chrissy before NY.

Love a good brunch and good coffee as I'm sure you all do. Wondering where the current hot spots or best cafe reccs are (anywhere in the city, we're mobile).

Have previously very much enjoyed:

- Penny University in Kingston 
- Mocan and Green Grout near city centre
- Redbrick Coffee City near city 
- Rebel Rebel although last time we visited wasn't doing brunch anymore great sadness. lovely dinner there though 
- a scandinavian themed place in Brandon that I can't find the name of

1pt5nxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Rare_Entertainment92/comments/1pt5nxf/morning_meditation/,Morning Meditation,"I write these things, mostly, in the morning, when I have the energy. The thing I have not figured out is sleep. I think the things we have most strongly to regulate in life are sleep and sex. I don't know what to call the 'sleep drive' but it is strong, as strong, perhaps stronger, than the 'sex drive', which may just be the life-drive itself, the drive-to-wakefulness. I would think 'horniness' is the opposite of 'sleepiness' more strongly than anything else, certainly more than drunkeness, which is really an adjunct (drink is a depressant) or highness (there is more to awakeness than stress or a high heart rate). A high heart rate matters, but alertness is more than that.

I now, pretty directly, describe states of the body. 'States' were important to Blake. They were unchanging; we passed through them, including a state he called Satan--our subjection to clock-time and yardstick-space, or Newtonian space.

But I have conflated high and stress, whereas some people would go the other way and say high and calm--in fact the biology and psychology are split here; there are calm and crack highs on either end of the spectrum. It depends what you're taking, and on your physiology. I am intrigued that coffee almost always stresses, whereas tea frequently calms. But it is both caffeine.

Someone will say 'l-theanine'--but what is l-theanine? I don't know either, not really.

Whatever is in weed, it matters, the strain, the mix; every weed is different. The differences in alcohol are less pronounced. It is basically all the same, wine or beer or vodka. It is really--the difference really is how fast you can drink it (and if it has bubbles). But I would think they affect the digestion differently, and certain drinks even are digestif.

But I am all over the place.

Sleep is really the deepest drink, and the highest high--the lowest too as well. I hate nightmares and dark dreams, I really don't get the light kind, although sometimes I get something almost sexy. I think your dreams reflect your reality, but I am not an adept in the dreamwork. It was one of Freud's weaknesses, and is one of my own. I hear that people turn to Jung on dreams, but I do not turn to Jung on anything.

I keep in my corners.

To be able to read the dream well, like Joseph, would be something. But one would need first then to *have* dreams, which, really, I don't have.

I used to as a kid, quite vivid, too vivid, but no longer. I worry about sleep, which is not good for sleeping (I hear). In fact in one study I saw the people *who thought* they had good sleep were more refreshed (scored higher on tests) than people who 'had' slept better, *but thought they had not*. The placebo is strong, is perhaps everything.

You are supposed to remove 'sleep stress' by not putting to much pressure on yourself. It is one of the hardest things to recognize in life, *when we are putting to much pressure on ourself*. It is easy enough to tell when it is another, but people are often bludgeoned by themself and do not know it; they go around looking down, afflicted, attacked, and it is all in their own mind.

We are against self-punishment, even of the evil, unless it leads to some good. If the result of all this self-hating were a fantastic self-creating, something could be said for it. But beating up on oneself often just leads to more beating up on oneself, in an endless cycle.

Practically the cyclical and the stationary are the same, which is why Freud called the compulsion to repeat the Death Instinct, or Death Drive (which later editors to match his *Eros* have called *Thanatos*). Freud was a great mythologist of the mind.

Blake equated the *cyclical* and the *natural*, which was why Tirzah was to be resisted, even thrown off as irrelevant, no part of the true self, which was the Imagination, a thing *before* creation--

If what is born of Mortal Birth  
Shall be consumed with the earth  
To rise from generation free,  
**Then what have I to do with thee?**

The answer here is *nothing*.

What *is* here? Nothing but the weather: **They practice enough for heaven / Ever-jubilant, what is there here but \[the\] weather? / What spirit have I, except it comes from the Sun?**

I am with the ecstatic Stevens in the end, and on the side of sobriety, despite my dallying. But sobriety is 'drunk on life' or 'high on life', it is music, dancing, sex--or the hunger for the thing. I have written posts, too many, on the need for love, for sex, in life.

Life in the end, pragmatically, is *about* sex--I mean the word in both senses. The meaning of your life, of mine, is a copulation, the one that got you in here--the one that will keep you going, if you decide to make a child, or children.

But life is, clearly, about more than that--and even the deed, as great as it is, is just one of life's pleasures.

I am not a denigrater of sex. I am a great celebrator of it. And I am rather on the side of the fetishizers of the body than of its detractors; enough bad things have been said, especially about the female form. The things are good--

I mean, the knees are bad; the hips are small; the eyes go; the teeth fall out. But the thing holds up well in general, and we cannot expect to live forever.

It is, besides, on us to keep up the good health. We tell life everyday whether we'd like to stick around. Show a good face and you'll get another day. Be vigorous in activity; be after the thing.

Be unsure, and life will be unsure about you. That is why I think it is important to keep up the hunger.

My religion is strange, since I don't have any. I think religion ought to have a pagan and practial meaning--*what do you do?* I do what almost everyone else in America does, which is put up a tree on the wrong day, play music about the house, by a Poinsettia, give each other gifts, and call ourselves Christian, or not. What *difference* does it make?

Later historians will be amused by *my* atheism, in contrast to my partner's faith. We put up decorations for Halloween and Grinches beside our nativity scenes. It is a pure pagan thing all the way down, including this Thanksgiving.

My *spirituality* is gnostic, which is to say, is nothing, is a 'knowing' (and being known). The best definition of *gnosticism* I have found is a *quest for unprecedentedness*. That is saying--well, what is it saying?

My real spirituality is Emersonian, *is* self-reliance. I believe what Emerson said in ""Experience"", which is itself a kind of *Song of Experience* to Self-Reliance's *Song of Innocence*:

**hold hard to this poverty**

You have nothing, or you feel you have nothing. You fly to foreign parts. Emerson say: ""No!"" Stay at home, remain where you are; look within.

**hold hard to this poverty**

'poverty' is a special term for Emerson; it means imaginative need, which is really *the need for story*, the need for a myth, or new word--or, as it were, New Word, a new testament or speech.

Emerson, probably, would have agreed with the reductive idea that the Imagination just *is* figurative language. In that case, the imagination does not create, and then speak.

It speaks.

It creates and speaks in the same act. 'The thought is prior' said Emerson, by which he meant *has priority*, as the moral 'tells the story'--but, of course, or often enough (with Aesop's fables for example), the moral is told *after*, is even thought of *after*, so its priority, its 'telling of the story', is *spiritual* rather than a real, chronological *firstness*.

This is where gnosticism combines with Emersonianism.

*gnosticism* is the quest for firstness, to be forever ***early***

Chronological earliness has to be given up on pretty early. One for a while is allowed to entertain notions of time machines, then one needs to give up on that. The cycles tell a different story. There is no going back. But there *is* a bending what is behind so strongly that you subordinate it. The story *seems to belong* to the moral, rather than the moral being a 'tag' (god forbid a 'hashtag').

Of course, some later writers *do* fail in the quest for the first fire, and seem to provide notes rather than new material.

And some notetakers outstrip their source material.

*gnosticism* is the quest to expand without deforming, *really* to build on the past, which is to accept and expand it, not as we try, to deny it

repression is possible; deletion is a dream

*gnosticism* is the quest to achieve earliest seeing at this late stage in history

*gnosticism* is the ridiculous attempt, as Nietzsche recommended us,

*To live as if it were Morning...*

We met on Bumble, and he told me early on that he had recently gone through a breakup. As we kept talking, he explained that he was still living with his ex and that they had only been broken up for about a month. They had moved here from another country together, were each other’s only support system, and shared a studio space because they are both artists. She was the one who broke up with him.

Despite all of this, I decided to keep seeing him because our connection felt really strong.

A few weeks into dating, he agreed to pick me up from an event, but the day of, he told me he might not be able to because his ex was going through emotional turmoil and he needed to be there for her. This upset me, and I asked him to be clear about his timeline for fully ending that relationship and what his contact with her would look like moving forward.

He told me he only wanted to be friends with her and that at most they’d occasionally get coffee. That same week, he moved out so he wouldn’t have to be there for her anymore. I was okay with this and even told him I understood if he needed time to tell her about us, since she was fragile.

After he moved out, I didn’t think much about it. However, a few weeks later, I noticed he was still frequently sending her reels. It bothered me, but I tried not to make it an issue.

Then on Halloween, his ex called him upset because she wanted to go out, and he already had plans. She said she had no one and blamed him for it. He asked me if it was normal that he didn’t really care anymore, and I told him it wasn’t his responsibility to take care of her.

That night, I asked if she knew about us. He said she didn’t, which surprised me given how fast and intense our relationship had become. He also told me they spoke on the phone weekly, sometimes 2–4 times. I explained that this level of contact likely made her feel he was still emotionally available and asked him to tell her about us. He agreed and eventually did.

Even after that, I felt uncomfortable with how much they still communicated, the shared studio space, and the ongoing calls and messages. Then one day he received a text from an unknown number in his native language with a heart. He told me it was his ex and that it said, “Are we still meeting tomorrow?” I directly asked him if he was cheating. He said no and offered to show me his messages, which I declined.

I told him that what I needed was for him to clearly set boundaries with her and significantly reduce contact, because the current situation made me uncomfortable. I explained that she likely still thinks there’s a chance of reconciliation because of how emotionally available he remains. He said he understood and admitted he thought the timeline for distancing himself would be longer, but now realized it needs to happen sooner.

After talking to friends and reflecting on how emotionally draining this has been for me, I told him that given the timeline and nature of their relationship, I would feel much more comfortable if contact with her was reduced to almost nothing. I don’t mind following each other on Instagram or maybe one or two coffees a year, but what’s happening now can’t continue if I’m going to feel safe and comfortable in this relationship.

But today, I sent her a 'good morning' text and she took five hours to reply. What is going on? Is this some kind of test or game?

Am I overthinking it?

Especially when I have to wait in line to place my order then stand in the lobby or wait in my car for my coffee and then get attitude from the people when I choose to decline giving them additional money. What did they do to think they deserved a tip? News flash, tips are a privilege NOT a right.

1pt5hk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pt5hk0/the_naughty_list/,The Naughty List,"It was Christmas Eve, and the snow outside blanketed the streets like a soft, white shroud. The city felt muffled, as if someone had pressed a hand over its mouth. I was alone in my apartment, the lights on the tree flickering gently, casting warped shadows across the walls. Somewhere below, a radio played a distant carol, thin and distorted through the cold.

That was when I heard it.

The faintest jingling, like bells carried on the wind.

At first, I laughed. “Probably some neighbor,” I muttered, pulling my sweater tighter. The building was old. Sounds traveled strangely here. But the jingling didn’t fade. It moved—slowly, deliberately—circling the apartment, stopping outside my door.

Then came the knock.

Not loud. Not urgent. Just a slow, patient tapping, as if whoever stood there knew I would answer eventually.

I waited a full minute before opening the door.

The hallway was empty. No footsteps, no elevator hum. Just the smell of cold air and dust. On the mat sat a small package, wrapped in red paper with a green ribbon tied perfectly flat. No snow on it. No footprints nearby.

I bent down and read the tag.

“To You. From Santa.”

I almost left it there. Almost. But curiosity has always been my worst habit. I picked it up and brought it inside, locking the door behind me. The moment the package crossed the threshold, a smell filled the room—pine and cinnamon, sharp and festive, mixed with something metallic that made my stomach turn.

Blood has a smell like that.

I tore the paper open. Inside was a tiny carved wooden Santa, no bigger than my hand. Its smile was too wide, stretching nearly from ear to ear. Its eyes were two deep, black pits that swallowed the light around them. The craftsmanship was unsettlingly detailed—wrinkles, beard strands, even tiny boots.

I set it on the table and stepped back.

That’s when the jingling started again. Louder this time. Closer.

Heavy boots thudded on the stairs outside my apartment, each step slow and measured. The doorknob rattled once. Twice. I backed away, heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat.

The wooden Santa tilted its head.

“I’ve been watching,” a voice said.

It didn’t come from the door. It came from everywhere at once, low and raspy, like dry leaves dragged across concrete.

I froze. My apartment was small—one bedroom, one bathroom, nowhere to hide. There was no one else here. There couldn’t be.

That’s when I noticed the tree.

The ornaments were gone.

In their place hung dozens of small carved figures, swaying gently. People. Men, women, children. Every single one was painfully familiar. My downstairs neighbor with the crooked smile. The woman across the hall who always smelled like coffee. The old man who fed pigeons outside the building.

All of them were bound with tiny ropes, their wooden faces twisted in terror.

Something cold crawled up my spine.

The Santa on the table shuddered. Its joints creaked as it stretched, growing taller, limbs lengthening unnaturally. The wood cracked, splitting to reveal something dark and wet beneath. Its mouth opened wider than any mouth should.

“Naughty… or nice?” it whispered.

The lights went out.

The door exploded inward with a deafening crack. Cold air rushed in, carrying the stench of rot and snow. A figure filled the doorway, towering and wrong. The red suit was torn and filthy, soaked dark at the hems. Bells dangled from its wrist, jingling softly with every movement.

Its face was pale and stretched tight, eyes hollow and endless. When it smiled, its teeth were jagged and uneven, like they’d been carved by hand.

“I know if you’ve been good this year,” it said, stepping into the apartment. The floor groaned beneath its weight. “I check my list. I check it twice.”

I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t run. My body refused to obey me.

“And I always deliver,” it continued, leaning close enough that I could smell old blood and pine sap on its breath, “personally.”

It reached for me.

I screamed.

I woke up gasping, tangled in my sheets, morning light spilling through the window. My heart raced as I scanned the room. The tree stood bare. No ornaments. No wooden figures. The table was empty. The door was intact.

A dream, I told myself. Just a nightmare.

Then I saw it.

Beneath the tree sat a small tag, folded neatly in half.

“To You. From Santa.”

On the back, written in careful, looping letters, were four words:

“Next year, I’ll know.”

Outside, somewhere far down the street, bells jingled softly.

And they were getting closer.",1,1766424642.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1pt5gqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1pt5gqs/i_need_a_big_vent_after_being_accused_of_stealing/,I need a big vent after being accused of stealing my Dad.,"I had cut ties with my siblings since my Dad died unexpectedly 10 weeks ago. One sister is a nasty drunk that none of us have had anything to do with for about 10 years; the other sister is fine but has a narcissistic husband who took it upon himself to be the spokesperson for the family, requesting only he be contacted by the funeral home; and a brother who we were close with but lost it emotionally and said things I cannot forgive. My mother was always a ""mother,"" never a mum, but we were communicating weekly or so. She'd refer to me as ""the self sufficient, organised one."" But I was Daddy's little girl, right up until his last afternoon, and it had caused jealousy before. I was the last to speak to him, other than him trying to yell to my mother for help.

Dad did not have a Will or any plans in place. He died instate which means a mess of paperwork. Some people are do-er's and some just are not. My Dad was the do-er, my mother never was. I am a do-er, same as the sober sister, but the other two are not. In the day's following Dad's death, actually 5 days, nobody had organised anything other than myself. Nobody wanted to deal with it. I did send everything to my mother for her opinion, reminding her what needs organising, who to contact etc. I was then told to pull my head in (not so nice) by the drunk and brother. On day six I went and collected tubs of photo albums to sort through which nobody had thought to do. The three siblings and their partners had been there all day, every day. I was then accused of ""stealing."" I was done and sadly Dad's funeral was gross. Not respectful at all, especially for a great man who dedicated himself to his community. The main song I had never heard before, and my mother couldn't even tell me what it was. I was excluded from all plans. My brother had booked a venue for the reception, in two days time, without even having met with the funeral home or dad being release from the coroner.

Anyway, skip to last Friday and I was talking to my mother. I asked how why she had not told me when Dad had come home, and which urn had been chosen. Turned out he had not been picked up! She said she didn't know what to do and asked me to arrange to pick him up. I rang the funeral home and sorted out a time for today. I told my mother I would collect him, and asked her if an urn had been organised. She said she'll get back to me, though didn't and ignored my reminder messages.

My children and I picked him up today. Emotionally an absolute mess and I needed to get back home so he came with us. Mother knew this. Bawled in the pantry for two hour's then Dad and I had a coffee and a chat while I calmed down. It was a relief and I felt better than I had since he passed. The first time I wasn't filled with anger and heartache. I had never had a moment to say my goodbye to him and felt I finally had that moment.

I had spoken to my mother saying I had picked him up, he was safe and we would bring him up tomorrow. As no urn had been organised, I would make one - I like woodwork and it was something Dad and I shared. She was happy with that. Happy he would be home with her for Christmas. But then hubby starts getting messages from drunk sister. She doesn't have a way of contacting me directly. I had stolen him. I had no right. If he wasn't returned by her deadline they would all storm my house. How low and disgusting can someone be to steal someone's ashes... 
She drives past the funeral home to go to work, yet had never done it. Nor my brother drives past to get to and from work. The messages kept getting nastier and nastier.

We jumped in the car, with Dad, and drove to my mother's and passed him over. I was hysterical. Hubby was furiously calm. Tween kid's upset because they had both too had their chats with Poppy too for the first time. Mother did not know this was going on but she soon found out. I let loose. My brother has access to the security cameras and seems had overheard her talking to me on the phone, then contacted the drunk, who sounded like she was quite full as the messages started.

All the way home afterwards, hubby kept getting messages about our selfishness for not letting my children have contact with their grandmother. Never once have I kept her from them. Actually, she had not once asked to see or speak to them. She had not ask about my youngest graduation from primary school or the results of my other child's broken finger or him finishing at his current school. Nothing actually, but that's nothing new for her. Their relationship was always with Poppy and were very close.

Before we left my mother's, she had given the kid's something each. I had assumed it was a Christmas card with money or a voucher or something. It turned out to be bank books for very, very small amounts. Something she had started many years ago for older grandchildren and given to them when they turned 18. She had made no deposits into these accounts for 10 years - why bother. The kids were confused as to why she had given them the books (or what they were). Is this her way of saying she is done with them too. There was no Christmas present for them. She had given the other grandchildren theirs over the weekend just gone. She did however ask if we should sort through the photos again ""now,"" since she had mixed them back up. Hubby was quick to say he'd been up for 18 hours and it had taken me over two day's to do it the first time. 

I did not think it could get worse than it was. I had felt he was stolen from me the way he went. Essentially he should still be alive and well. Nobody should wait 23 minutes and make 3 other phone calls before ringing emergency. I was at peace with walking away from my siblings. Now it's blown out and what little relationship I had with mother, and my kid's with her, has gone. The couple of hours of relief I had felt is gone and I am back to feeling like I did the first evening he passed.

He waved, grinned, and disappeared ahead while I sat there fuming. That image haunted me for the rest of the day. Eight miles to work. That was my commute. Eight miles that somehow took 45 minutes most mornings because of traffic. Meanwhile, Jake was probably already at his desk with his coffee. That weekend, I walked into a bike shop feeling slightly ridiculous.

The guy working there had me test ride one, and I wasn’t prepared for how it felt.

He explained how the assist levels worked, how I could control how much help the motor gave me. Hills that would normally destroy me? Suddenly manageable.

I kept thinking about arriving at work sweaty and gross, but he showed me how adjustable the assist was. I could dial it up on hot days to minimize exertion. Rain was another worry until I saw all the weatherproof gear available.

Instant coffee or nothing, those were the options. Then my nephew showed up at our family camping trip with this weird contraption that looked like it belonged in a sci fi movie. It was a solar kettle. He set up these reflective panels, filled the container with water, and twenty minutes later we had boiling water for proper coffee. No fuel, no electricity, just sunlight. I was more fascinated by the device than the coffee, honestly.

Back home, I fell down this research rabbit hole about solar thermal technology. The basic physics was straightforward, but the practical engineering was clever. Reflective surfaces concentrated sun energy onto a small area, dramatically increasing temperatures. Performance depended on weather and sun angle, but for the right conditions, these things were legitimately useful.

The applications went way beyond camping convenience too. Developing regions without reliable electricity could benefit hugely. Emergency preparedness kits could include these for disaster situations. The more I learned, the more possibilities I saw.

I started comparing different models, efficiency ratings, portability features. Some folded flat for easy transport, others prioritized heating speed. The price range was all over the place. Found options on Alibaba from budget to premium.

My nephew thought it was hilarious that I’d gotten so into this. What started as curiosity about his camping gadget turned into genuine interest in renewable energy applications. Now I’m that person at parties talking about solar technology.",4,1766424223.0,solarenergy,0,1.0,False

My mother in law is extremely quirky and I love how charismatic she is but I’m having a really hard time and need advice. She had her son, my husband, at 16 and I am 7 years older than him so she is only 10 or so years older than me. When he went to college, she joined the military and moved abroad. I was back to school and met him through mutual friends and we ended up moving in together as roommates as fate would have it. We realized we cohabitated really well and fell in love to my surprise. Our entire relationship, his mother has lived abroad or across the country. We’ve traveled extensively to visit her. He even broke up with me at one point and moved to Korea to be with her. He soon realized he made a mistake and returned home to me after blowing an insane amount of savings and setting his life back. We survived. When she was living in Italy, she met an American man, got engaged, married, and moved to California to live in his family home that he inherited. She has always been demanding, overbearing, and extremely eccentric. I am fascinated by her and think the world of her but she’s very self centered. She is super intelligent and, at times, very condescending. When she lived in Italy, my husband went to stay there for 3 months. He always goes to her. I visited Europe many times while she was there. There are many instances where she has put us in bad positions. We aren’t rich so traveling to the ends of the earth to be with her is a sacrifice. I’ve even eaten canned black beans several nights a week to make ends meet so I can visit. I always prioritize visiting! When she randomly decides to visit us, we cancel plans to accommodate her. She always keeps things hidden until last minute because she is a bad communicator or manipulative, not really sure which. I have hundreds of stories of how she ruined travel plans with last minute bullshit. Recently, we went to CA to visit and her man insisted we go out to eat with his family every night which meant we had to cut all of our hikes and adventures short. We told them we didn’t want to get dinner with them a few nights and it caused drama so we ended up going. Her and her husband fought the entire time. We always pay our way. We made due even though it sucked. He recently served her with divorce papers so she quit her job, drove cross country, and had all of her things moved to a storage unit up the street from us. She came here a week ago to help the movers and she hasn’t left. She decided to stay through Christmas without asking. He told me in front of her so I had no choice but to be ok with it. My husbands birthday is the 19th so I had to change our dinner reservations and they could only get the 3 of us in at 8:30PM. When we got there, she insisted on sitting next to him. I had to pay for everyone bc she is going through all of this. It was $300 and neither of them said thank you. He even made fun of the food and called it Chef Boy R Dee. I make doubles his salary but we do usually have a very healthy and loving relationship, we rarely fight. I made the bday plans bc he wouldn’t really tell me what he wanted to do and I was trying to be nice. His mother was talking shit on her family and said they make gift giving about themselves so they can look and feel good lol. So, I felt uncomfortable about the fancy dinner and felt weird saying anything but I’m really angry. We don’t have a spare bedroom so she’s on our couch which means I can barely leave my room or office without being confronted with her. She has no boundaries and he never tells her about herself. So, I’ve barely been speaking to them bc I’m about to implode. Saturday and Sunday they went out on their own without inviting me (in their defense I obviously need space) and he barely text me or checked in. So I text him on Sunday saying we need to talk in private. He never responded. He’s mad that I’m mad. I called hisphone 9x, he never answered. I could have been in an emergency situation. After 6 hours of sitting in the woods trying to calm my nerves but unable to, I decided to go home. I walked in and said “we need to speak in private” and his mother got right in the middle and said he needed to eat. That didn’t go over well with me so I made him go to the garage where he said things like “you have some weird jealousy issues over my relationship with my mom”. I’m so hurt! I work a very stressful job and usually work 10+ hours a day. This is my Christmas break and he doesn’t even give a shit about my feelings! She’s waking me up early grinding coffee for 30 minutes and keeps saying manipulative things about people “making things about them”. I’m seriously feeling like I’m battling a mental health crisis at this point. Am I wrong to be pissed? She didn’t ask to stay this long and just expected to. We aren’t even that close because she’s never around and we don’t talk much on the phone. He doesn’t prioritize her when she’s not here and then feels guilty and goes all in when she’s around. I know she’s in a tough spot but this is causing a great deal of anxiety for me.

I've never done this before so I'm just trying to understand the logistics and be prepared. I plan to keep things simple since I will be using my Lelit Victoria + Niche Zero grinder. I'm thinking I'll have a limited menu (only espresso/americano and iced drinks) since my machine can't steam and pull shots simultaneously and being outdoors makes it harder to clean steaming pitchers without some kind of rinser setup. Not expecting more than 20-30 people.

I plan to have:

* Table
* Little ""menu""
* Espresso machine + grinder
* Tamp station
* Scale
* Knock Box
* Small trash can
* Cleaning rags (wet + dry)
* Cooler (ice, milks)
* 2-3 jugs water to refill machine
* Bucket to dump liquids/drip tray
* 8oz paper cups
* 12oz plastic cups
* Marker (write names on cups?)
* Straws
* 2-3 12oz bags of coffee
* Large bag of ice, maybe 2
* Dedicated ice scooper
* Whole milk (gallon) and Oat milk (1-2 gallons)
* 1, maybe 2 homemade syrups (vanilla+seasonal) for iced lattes


I have worked as a barista before so I'm not too concerned about volume if people show up in clusters. I might also pre-weigh some shots to help with speed.

We are not particularly close, but we have interacted on and off over time.

Recently, we started talking again and occasionally discussed meeting up for coffee or casual hangouts. I began noticing a consistent pattern. When I suggested meeting, they were usually busy, tired, or vague about plans. When they suggested something, there was an expectation that I would be flexible and make time.

At first, I assumed it was just normal scheduling issues. Over time, it became clear that the effort was uneven. I felt like I was adjusting my availability and expectations more than they were.
Instead of bringing it up directly, I chose to stop initiating plans and simply respond when they reached out. I did not ignore them or act rude. I just stopped compensating for the imbalance.

 As a result, communication slowed significantly.
Recently, they commented that I seemed distant and asked if something was wrong. I replied that I have been busy and focusing on other priorities, which is accurate. Still, I am wondering if not addressing it directly makes me unreasonable

1pt56wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1pt56wi/my_positive_colpo_experience/,My (positive) Colpo Experience,"I just want to give my input on colposcopies because the internet made me freak out and cry for days in fear and I want to tell my experience to maybe make someone feel better. For reference I am 26.

I got my first abnormal pap last year with high risk HPV. I came back after one year (on December 2) and my results came back abnormal again, so I scheduled a colpo. This was my first time at this new gyno and I will say my doctor is incredible. If your doctor has no empathy for your fear of this procedure, find a new one!! There is no reason this procedure should be as painful and I’ve heard from other women (though I understand everyone is different).

I was prescribed 1mg of Lorazepam to ease my anxiety day-of and told to take 800mg of ibuprofen. So the day comes, I take all of the above an hour before my colpo. My doctor allowed my boyfriend to come in which I will say distracted me as well. I was also crying when she walked in and right before the biopsies and she was so nice and patient and made me laugh and I’m very grateful for that.

In detail, the speculum itself felt no different than it does for a regular pap, so that didn’t bother me. She applied the vinegar solution with swabs (felt like a pap as well, felt a bit cold but no pain or burning). She kept swabbing during the exam to clean up discharge (again, uncomfortable, but no more pain than a regular pap). She said she’d be taking 2 biopsies and one in the center with a swab. I was told I would get lidocaine for the biopsies beforehand and it ended up being the spray kind- I’m pretty sure just like the one they use to numb your skin before a tattoo sometimes and she let that sit for a minute. She did say it may be a placebo effect whether it helps or not but I’d like to say I think the ibuprofen, lorazepam, and “lidocaine” did the trick because the biopsies really felt like a simple pinch! She took one at 5:00 and 2 at 1:00, counting down from 3 each time to warn me (she took 2 at 1:00 because she didn’t get all of it on the first try). The last one was a larger swab in the cervix which lasted for 10 seconds two times (super crampy but doable). Lastly, she applied the liquid bandaid which I did not feel at all, so it didn’t burn like some people said it did for them. From the speculum being put in to being taken out, I would say the procedure lasted no more than 10 minutes, and most of those minutes she was just examining.

As for healing, I cramped for an hour or two after I was done and I had the “coffee grounds” only once! The smell was definitely unpleasant following as well.

I just got my results and they came back low-grade change and so I just need to come back for a regular pap in a year. I just wanted to put a more positive experience out there because I see so many scary and negative experiences about this (not to invalidate any other women’s experiences at all). Women deserve pain management in procedures like this and it’s imperative you find a doctor willing to be patient and gentle with you.",2,1766423946.0,PreCervicalCancer,7,1.0,False

1pt5510,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1pt5510/another_dream/,Another dream,"a,

I'm more so writing for post clarity, I’m not sure if you care, but I had another spiritual dream. You were the only other person I shared these dreams with after all of the crazy events that happened between us. You were my comfort person to go to but we don't talk anymore or maybe it's that I stopped wanting to share with you what scares me. When we lived near the nursing home last yr, and having our apartment being the corner unit across from the building, we heard sirens go off on the daily. It was terrifying to hear but it almost became something normal to hear in the bg. What I wasn't prepared for was the dreams that came with living there with you and seeing the senior citizens when I slept. I thought that the dreams would stop once I moved back home but I'm still getting them. It's gotten better honestly, sometimes I think it is my psyche bridging towards my reality but my body feels it really intensely and some nights it's hard to manage so I can't fall back asleep. I think writing it out has helped me cope with the feelings of loss.

I was transported back to a time where I lived with my grandma. Theres a lady that likes to follow me but this time I see her in full apparition. I only see her in my dreams now but she manifested when I was a kid living in a really old house lving on the southside of this small town I grew up in. I've never seen her in full view but sometimes I see her in the mirrors when I'm back at my grandma's house in my dreams. I think partially that is why I don't like coming back to this town is because I'm reminded of the dreams and my childhood.  My therapist says to imagine her as a character to cope outside of this dreamscape. She has really long black hair that cascades as long draped kimono, or maybe it was a really long patterned dress. She was standing by the stairway of the basement of where I use to live and she was turned away facing the wall. I got spooked, as if my conscious recognizes that I am in slumber but also slightly awake. So I walk away from her, towards my mom’s room (which does not exist anymore in reality because I'm fully aware that what I'm seeing is the past version of the basement I lived in.) But all I can see is the lady floating towards me but she was still faced the other way. I was fully scared at this point, getting the goosebumps when I realized there was no where to escape and no one to run to. I woke up at this point but I can still see her lingering on the edge of my dreamscape. Her long kimono was patterned in black and white and it was so long that it trailed as she floated. I’m not sure if she was a vengeful spirit but sometimes I like to think that she appears during times when I feel the most distressed. She likes to remind me to make decisions when I feel paralyzed to make real life them in real life. Partially, I think it's the feeling of abandonment that's underlying my real problems. I try not to let her haunt me anymore because she is a character in my head now. But sometimes when I'm drinking my iced coffee in the mornings, this is what I'm thinking of and how I wished I was still comforted by you. I know we use to take the trails together by the ocean but I hope as hell that she didn't follow me back home.  I wanted to let you know that I'm still scared lol.

1pt53pc,https://i.redd.it/jccora06gs8g1.jpeg,What do you play to survive Monday and get into the groove? ☕,"Hey everyone! 👋

The weekend flew by like a failed speedrun. Yesterday, we might have been raiding until dawn or grinding ranks, and today our brains feel like an overheated graphics card. Reaction time is that of a piece of bread, and the desire to read tons of RPG text is zero.

Diving into a sweaty competitive shooter in this state is a morale killer. Starting a new 100-hour story campaign is terrifying.

We need something to ""warm up."" Seed games, meditation games or flow games.

Here's my personal ""Top 3 for a Lazy Monday"" to make your fingers remember how to hold a controller without your brain boiling over:



**Vampire Survivors / Brotato**

The perfect choice for the ""I'm a vegetable"" state. You only need one stick. You just walk around, and damage numbers fill the screen, giving you cheap but much-needed dopamine. A 15-20 minute session is perfect with morning coffee or during a break.

**Forza Horizon** 

Not racing, just ""free-ride."" Turn on your favorite music (or a podcast), pick a beautiful car, and just drive into the sunset. No goals, no aggression. Just physics, speed, and beautiful scenery. The best therapy.

**Balatro (or any card-based roguelike)**

Poker where you can cheat. Makes your brain wake up and do a little math but doesn't pressure you with timers. ""Just one more hand"" and suddenly you're ready to tackle work tasks.



*Question for the sub*

What game serves as your ""recovery game"" after a wild weekend?

What do you jump into for 20-30 minutes just to reset without extra stress?

Ever feel like you're hustling 24/7 but your bank account isn’t reflecting the grind? Yeah, me too. That’s why I’ve been diving deep into AI-powered passive income streams—and let me tell you, the future is *now*. In 2026, AI isn’t just a buzzword; it’s your secret weapon for making money while you sleep (or binge-watch your favorite show 🍿).

Here are **3 actionable ways** to use AI for content-based passive income this year—no tech degree required!

---

### **1. AI-Generated Niche Blogs (The Set-It-and-Forget-It Goldmine)**
- **Pick a micro-niche** (think “eco-friendly cat toys” or “budget gaming setups for students”). The more specific, the better!
- **Use AI tools** like Jasper or SurferSEO to churn out SEO-optimized posts. Feed it a few keywords, and boom—you’ve got a blog post in minutes.
- **Monetize with ads + affiliates**. Slap on Google AdSense or Amazon Associates links, and let the traffic (and cash) roll in.

*Pro tip:* Automate social media promo with tools like Buffer or Hootsuite. Your blog grows while you sip coffee. ☕

---

### **2. AI-Powered YouTube Shorts/TikTok Clips (Viral Content on Autopilot)**
- **Repurpose long-form content** (or let AI generate scripts) into bite-sized clips. Tools like Pictory or InVideo turn blog posts into engaging videos *instantly*.
- **Use AI voiceovers** (hello, Murf.ai!) to keep things fresh without recording a single word.
- **Post consistently** (AI helps with scheduling too!) and watch the ad revenue + sponsorships pile up.

*Bonus:* AI can even suggest trending hashtags or edits to boost engagement. Talk about a cheat code! 🎮

---

### **3. AI-Curated Newsletters (The Underrated Cash Cow)**
- **Niche down** (e.g., “AI tools for solopreneurs” or “sustainable fashion deals”).
- **Use AI to curate content**—tools like Curated.co or Beehiiv scrape the web for trending topics in your niche. Add your personal touch, and hit send.
- **Monetize with sponsorships** or paid subscriptions. Brands *love* targeted audiences, and AI makes it effortless.

*Why this works:* People crave curated info. Be their go-to source, and the money follows.

---

**Final thought:** Passive income isn’t about luck—it’s about leveraging the right tools. Speaking of tools, I recently stumbled on a community that’s all about automated reselling with *guaranteed* 10x ROI. They send daily secret deal alerts, and I’m testing it out.

Hey Reddit! 👋

You know that feeling when a friend sends you a bunch of restaurant names like ""YOU HAVE TO TRY THESE!"" and then... three months later you're standing on that street corner scrolling through endless chat history trying to find that one specific place?

That was my daily life. I had locations scattered everywhere: Apple Maps pins, Notes app, random screenshots, and buried group chats. It was absolute chaos. I tried Notion (too heavy) and Google Maps (too cluttered), but I just wanted something simple: **Open -> Save -> Find.**

So I spent the last few months building **Locolle** (Location + Collection).

**What makes it different?**

* **Collections like Playlists:** Think of them like Spotify playlists, but for places (e.g., ""Best Coffee Spots"" or ""Date Night Gems"").
* **Collaborative Lists:** You can share a collection with friends/partners so everyone can add their own spots. No more ""What should we eat?"" debates.
* **3D Earth View:** A visual way to see all your saved pins on a global scale. It feels really rewarding to see your travel history this way.

**What Locolle isn't:** It’s not a GPS navigator or a complex travel journal. It’s just a dedicated ""bookmark manager"" for the physical world.

**Feedback Giveaway 🎁** The app is iOS-only for now. I’m looking for real users to test it out and give me some brutal feedback. **I'm giving away 1-year Pro subscriptions ($24.99 value) to everyone who tries it out and shares a collection link below.**

1pt4rju,https://www.reddit.com/r/PakistaniiConfessions/comments/1pt4rju/why_everyone_in_pakistan_is_scared_of_a_happy/,Why Everyone in Pakistan is Scared of a Happy Independant Woman,"Okay, I will say it. Because someone has to say it. The biggest truth in our society is this: Pakistan is very, very scared of a woman who is free, happy and independant.

Just think about it. What does a free woman look like? She has her own job, her own money. She can decide to go to a coffee shop with friends without 100 questions. She laughs loudly in public and does not cover her mouth. She says her opinion, even if it is against a man. This woman, she is like a nightmare for our system.

Why is she a nightmare? Because our system is all about control. From father, to brother, to husband, to society uncles. Their control is everything. A woman who is free breaks this control. She does not need to ask for money for clothes. She does not need permission for every little thing. This is very dangerous for them.

So what do they do? They try to break her. They use everything they have.

First, they use ""Deen"". They will tell her, ""This is not modest. A good woman stays at home."" But they forget all the teachings about women's rights when it suits them. They use religion like a weapon, not for guidance, but for control.

Then, they use ""culture."" They will say, ""In our culture, women are respected inside the house."" But this respect means she is a prisoner in a golden cage. She cannot go out, she cannot live her life. This is not respect, this is fear.

And the biggest weapon: ""Log kya kahenge?"". This one sentence has destroyed more dreams than anything else. A woman wants to study more? ""Log kya kahenge?"" She wants to work? ""Log kya kahenge?"" She comes home a little late? ""Log kya kahenge?"" The whole society is like a jail where the guards are these invisible ""log"".

Now, let me talk about the biggest curse for a Pakistani girl: being ""educated"" and ""independent.""

People think it is a privilege. Let me tell you, it is a curse. A very lonely curse.

Your own family, who pushed you to get good grades, now looks at you like a problem. When rishtas come, your degree is a bad thing. Your own mother will say, ""Beta, don't tell them your real salary, they will feel inferior."" Or, ""Don't act too smart in front of them."" You feel like you have to hide your biggest achievements to make some man feel bigger.

The Rishta Aunties? They are the worst. You can see the fear in their eyes. They will say things like, ""She is very... capable."" Or, ""She is too independent. She might not adjust."" Adjust means become a quiet, obedient servant. They want a girl who is educated enough to teach their grandchildren, but not so educated that she has her own mind.

And the men? Oh, the men.

The traditional ones are easy to understand. They are openly scared. They want a woman who is less than them. In education, in salary, in confidence. They say they want a ""simple"" girl. Simple means a girl with no opinions.

But the modern ones, the ""liberal"" boys, they are the biggest joke. They will say they want an independent, strong woman. But what they really want is a cool, modern girl who still does all the traditional wife duties. They want you to have a job, but also do all the cooking and cleaning when you come home. They want you to be smart, but not smarter than them. They want you to be independent, but still obey their parents without question. They want a showpiece, not a partner.

So where does that leave these women? They are stuck in the middle.

They are too educated for the traditional men. They feel small next to them.

They are too ""traditional"" for the modern men. They are not their ""cool girlfriend"" from a TV show. They have families, they have some values, they are not completely ""free"" like they want.

These women end up completely alone. They have their own money, they can buy their own things, but they come home to an empty house. Society does not know what to do with them. Society cannot force them into the old box, so they just push them to the side.

They are scared because if women are truly free, then men have to compete as equals. And most Pakistani men cannot handle a woman as an equal. Their ego is too weak. Their confidence is too fake.

They want to be the king of a small, dirty pond. They are scared of the ocean.

So they will call these women names. They will say they are too loud, too ambitious, too western, too much. They will say no one will marry these women. They will try to make them feel sorry for theirselves.

But these women should not feel sorry. This loneliness is better than being in a cage with a man who is scared of your shadow.

Let them be scared. you will keep being happy. you will keep being free. And you will break this stupid system, one laugh at a time.",5,1766422973.0,PakistaniiConfessions,5,0.73,False

**Kast card crypto** has completely changed the way I handle my digital assets during my travels and daily coffee runs. I remember the frustration of sitting on a decent amount of USDT and having to wait days for a centralized exchange to process a withdrawal to my local bank, only to get hit with conversion fees that felt like daylight robbery. That all changed when I discovered Kast. It felt like finding a secret bridge between the digital world and the physical one, allowing me to pay for my morning latte or a new pair of shoes directly from my stablecoin balance.

***Start Kast Now :*** [***https://kastfinance.app.link/6MHGEMGE***](https://kastfinance.app.link/6MHGEMGE)  
***Use the code “6MHGEMGE” to receive 500 points ($25) after KYC + 1,000 points ($50) after you spend $100! + cashback up to 7%***

In this deep dive, I am going to share everything I have learned about this platform, from the setup process to the nitty gritty of the fee structure, so you can decide if it is the right financial tool for your pocket.

# The Ultimate Kast Card Review: Is This the Best Way to Spend Your Stablecoins?

When we talk about a **kast card review**, we have to look at the core utility: spending crypto in the real world. Unlike some older crypto cards that required you to manually sell your Bitcoin for Fiat before every purchase, Kast operates with a focus on stablecoins like USDT and USDC. This means you are not constantly worrying about the price of Bitcoin dropping while you are standing in line at the grocery store.

My experience with the app was surprisingly fluid. I downloaded it, went through the identity verification (KYC) which took about ten minutes, and had a virtual card ready to be added to my Apple Wallet almost instantly. For someone who values speed, this was a massive win. The interface is clean, and it does not feel like a clunky crypto project but rather a high end fintech app.

# Key Features That Set Kast Apart

* **Instant Virtual Issuance:** You can start spending online within minutes of approval.
* **Apple and Google Pay Integration:** No need to carry a physical card if you prefer tap-to-pay.
* **Stablecoin Focus:** Primarily designed for USDT, USDC, and USDe, reducing volatility risks.
* **Movement Partnership:** A major highlight is their collaboration with the Movement network, allowing users to earn up to 4% in rewards (like $MOVE tokens) on top of standard Kast Points.

# Understanding Kast Card Fees: What You Need to Know

Let’s get honest for a moment: no card is truly free, and understanding the **kast card fees** is crucial for any savvy user. From my research and personal usage, the fee structure is competitive but requires attention. While many traditional banks hide their fees in poor exchange rates, Kast is relatively transparent about its costs, though some users on social media have pointed out ""declined transaction fees"" that you should watch out for.

|**Service Type**|**Estimated Fee / Cost**|
|:-|:-|
|**Virtual Card Issuance**|Approximately $2.00|
|**Monthly Service Fee**|Varies by region (often around €4.99 for premium tiers)|
|**FX Markups**|Range between 1.5% to 2.5% for non-USD transactions|
|**ATM Withdrawals**|Fixed fee (around €2) plus potential network markups|
|**Declined Transaction**|Small fee (approx $0.50) if a swipe fails due to low funds|

I found that if you are spending in USD or a pegged currency, the efficiency is incredible. However, if you are traveling through Europe or Asia and spending in local non-USD currencies, you should keep an eye on the foreign exchange (FX) spread. It is still often cheaper than the predatory rates offered by airport currency exchanges, but it is a cost to factor in.

# Kast Card Country and Supported Countries: Can You Use It?

One of the most frequent questions I see is about the **kast card country and supported countries** list. The availability of crypto cards is a legal minefield, but Kast has managed to secure a footprint in over 150 countries. This makes it one of the more accessible options for users outside of the typical US/EU bubble.

# Region Highlights

The card is particularly popular in the **United Kingdom and the EEA (European Economic Area)**. However, what makes it a pro choice is its expanding support for emerging markets. I have seen users successfully utilizing the card in various parts of **Asia and South America**, where traditional banking can be restrictive.

**Commonly Supported Regions Include:**

* Most of the European Union (Germany, France, Spain, etc.)
* The United Kingdom
* Select countries in Southeast Asia (like the Philippines and Vietnam)
* Various regions in Latin America (Brazil is a growing market)
* United Arab Emirates

# Real World Feedback: What Users are Saying

https://preview.redd.it/f6z0fy78es8g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dd4f4018167725977c10962a90b216cc8831b3f

Scouring through community posts, the sentiment is generally positive regarding the speed of off-ramping. One user mentioned that being able to move Solana-based profits directly to a Visa card without a centralized exchange is a ""game changer.""

However, it is not all sunshine. Some users have reported issues with account freezes during security audits. While this is standard for regulated financial entities, it can be frustrating if your funds are tied up. The consensus is clear: use it as a spending tool, but perhaps do not keep your entire life savings in a custodial wallet.

# Final Verdict: Should You Get the Kast Card?

If you are a crypto native who gets paid in stablecoins or earns yield on-chain, the **kast card crypto** is a powerful ally. It bridges the gap between your digital wealth and your physical life with minimal friction. While the custodial nature and the FX fees on international spending are things to be mindful of, the convenience of instant liquidity and the new 4% rewards via Movement are hard to beat.

For me, the peace of mind knowing I can pay for a flight or a dinner using my USDT—without touching my local bank account—is worth the small fees. It represents a step toward true financial sovereignty in a world that is increasingly going digital.

I've been following this sub for a while. In fact, this sub is one of the reasons why I chose to take a sabbatical from my job in May 2025 and travel across Asia for 3 months. So thank you for that!!

  
Since coming back, I've quit my old job and some how got lucky to find a role that is fully remote, has 5 weeks of PTO and a work from anywhere program (for 1-2 months). I really want to take advantage of this now and even though I wouldn't be a full digital nomad, I can at least experience what its like for a few weeks every quarter :)

How you would spend your days during the weeks you're working (take it easy? routine? how is your lifestyle compared to back in your home country). 

  
Also, anything about this lifestyle you don't really like? I fell in love with travelling and it just was freeing going solo. So in my head, this seems like a dream. but for those actually experiencing it, might have a different opinion

His incredible training with our 6yo bernadoodle set the blueprint for how we are training our 13 week old goldendoodle. However a few days after we got her my man received an incredible promotion at work, but unfortunately that means he's working about 60 hours a week. I am in school online ATM so I have become the sole trainer and primary human for our puppy. She is so smart, very intuitive, and a bundle of energy. I have her on a solid schedule M-F that keeps me sane and her from entering gremlin mode every hour. She gets two long crate naps, two shorter ""bridge naps,"" and three rounds of independent time in our closed off dining area for 15-25 minutes. In between is filled with short but meaningful training sessions, field trips to new environments, and of course plenty of time to play and enjoy being a puppy. 

Then the weekend comes and while each day still includes these activities they tend to be shorter, less focused, a bit more chaotic. My fiancé gets so little time with her during the week so I absolutely want him to have that time to bond. But man, sometimes I want to scream ""SHE DOESN'T NEED TO COME OUT OF THE CRATE.

1pt4ixr,https://www.reddit.com/r/octopathtraveler/comments/1pt4ixr/just_finished_octopath_traveler_0_some_thoughts/,"Just finished Octopath Traveler 0, some thoughts...","I just finished my playthrough of Octopath Traveler 0, and here are some resonating thoughts I have fresh in its wake.

As it began, I felt a strong familiarity with the tragedy of losing one’s hometown to Eiyuden Chronicle Hundred Heroes, which I was a kickstarter backer and a huge fan of the Suikoden series. That being said, fans of the Suikoden series can attest that it has its fair share of dark moments that aren’t over the top dramatic, and feel more genuine, and hitting you hard right in the heart, fast.

So I lost my hometown… I met some friends, began rebuilding the town, and eventually slew the foppish clown who >!murdered mommy!< and hid behind a closet or something my main character never noticed existed, as they couldn’t enter it inside the house. I also >!killed the ridiculous Tytos!< and the more believable villain who threw drug-induced parties with the bourgeois. I met some friends along the way… and as subsequent chapters continued, kept helping them.

I had other party members that joined and became residents of my new town, and outside of Ludo, hardly any of these characters had serious development done with their arcs, leaving me wondering… why are they with me? We had some dialogues in the tavern, but nothing really entrenching nor endearing them to me, or me to them. In fact, it felt odd, artificial and shoe-horned in to synthesize closeness rather than having helped one another along the way. What nice folks, helping me along the way and all I did for Celsus was talked to a boy in the woods’ dad and relay it to him, towards the very end of the game!

I finally get these characters I’ve helped for chapter after chapter of the main story arc (it being about 90%+ of the entire game content, there really isn’t side-quest content of note coming to mind, it’s so infrequent, quickly done, and forgotten about), for the final push of the story. I get to finally make good on the more natural, genuine dynamic of friendship and fellowship being nurtured along, and for about 10% of the entire game, I get to make good on enjoying the effort of doing so.

I felt my heart sink when >!Elrica was killed!<. It was beautifully tragic, I thought… until I got to the later scene portraying her being abused by Father Christmas, planting the idea in mind this was likely a daily occurrence, my mind forming a picture of an abused child, helpless and unable to make it stop. Then the scene of her in >!hell where she screams in blood-curdling fashion as she’s corrupted!<, and it made me entirely resentful towards the devs. This wasn’t tastefully done, it’s simply delighting in the barbarism of a caged bird being tortured...again and again, even in the hereafter. All components together make me sick, and as one who’s life has been mired in tragedy in similar fashion of paternal abuse, the door-shut action of disallowing them to finally break the cage door open and at very least, fly away and taste freedom, is disgusting. An absence of brutality isn’t elevation or rising above trauma, normalcy isn’t a reward, and it made me foster genuine feelings of hatred for this game and its messaging.

I was looking forward to H’aanit very much, as she’s my favorite traveler from the first Octopath Traveler for her quirky way of speaking, her ill-timed laughs at Linde’s discomfort or unhappiness, and I’ll be honest, I find her pretty. I got into my first battle with her in my party, eagerly, and the game crashed. I tried a rare side-quest in Victor’s Hollow where it brought me to retrieve an item in the close-by ruins, and after two battles, the game crashed again. I’d played for hours straight prior to this, and had no issues. It is entirely from having H’aanit in my party, as once I removed her, it stopped entirely.

After this final crash, I realized something: I don’t really care about continuing the game other than the completionist compulsion in me. I genuinely belabored over trying to return the game on Steam as I’d found it rather unrewarding so far in its narrative, tiny world to explore, and 80% soundtrack that I’d heard from playing the first game several times through. I was en route to Sufraltajah to continue the >!Oskha arc with Bargello and company!<...and I was completely indifferent to everything.

I’d rebuilt Wishvale along the way, and having a farm in the worst possible location geographically was irritating, as was feeling compelled to build my town and have to move innumerable shrubs, lights, flowers and fences to accommodate a slowly growing map where I could customize and optimize its layout for aesthetics and so on. At game’s end, I can finally move my fields to somewhere else, but by then I’ve painstakingly made Wishvale ‘home’, and it was entrenched as it was, and the effort to move things around, redo everything and further optimize it felt too daunting.

I’ll simply say that >!Rinyuu deserved a better arc!<. Her >!end!< was pathetic, and >!for the two of them to not be able to ascend to a realm free of the hardship and everything!< is another bitter taste in my mouth. Again, absence of trauma isn’t elevation, attaining normalcy others enjoy isn’t equity, their scars deserve healing, they’ve paid their dues, and if anyone deserves peace, it’s >!Rinyuu!<, certainly.

I didn’t empathize with >!Sazantos’!< plight. This whole ‘Sephiroth” who-am-I arc is tiresome, as is the megalomaniac angle accompanying it. >!Sibling!< or not, I bit my tongue as I went through the motions of ‘>!saving his soul for the sake of the family!<’ garbage, and he apparently readily changed his ways, I guess. All forgiven! I can put him in a house now, without the game telling me I can though, so that’s something. He has a cat as a house-mate! So did I.

Without a “New Game +” mechanic of sorts, I don’t get to enjoy playing the next playthrough with an entire roster (don’t tell me it can’t be done, Eiyuden Chronicle Hundred Heroes let you do so with 121 characters right from the start of your next playthrough). I also get to abandon my battle-tested and champion gear I got at end-game and got to fiddle around with for a cup of coffee for some random side-quest of a dragon in heaven. Neat.

This made me pessimistic for Octopath Traveler 3. I don’t play games for the grindy, frustrating elements of trying to overcome challenges, I play them for the reward of having paid my dues, and getting to sit back and enjoy the story in its full without the distractions of trying to gain people, collect weapons and have what I previously had once again. While the previous games also didn’t have a New Game+, you were able to explore a rather large world and if strategic, find some killer gear fairly early on and circumvent the caps the game had in place.

The dark tone is one thing, but the simple fact that the game didn’t reward me for playing it and enduring it, that’s another entirely. Could these things be addressed in subsequent DLC content? Maybe. Hopefully, especially the stuff with >!Elrica!< and >!Rinyuu!<... but I’m pessimistic. They even stripped away the majority of the humor notes that made the first two games more endearing (Lucia cutting off Cyrus’ rambling with “Enough!” cracks me up to this day, it’s so perfectly delivered. Or how about Odette laughing at Cyrus being in trouble with the Atlasdam academy for unintentionally flirting? Or Ochette constantly eating and getting chastised by Mahina? Heehee…)

Positives? Seeing >!Hornburg!< in somewhat all of its glory. That was awesome. The scenes in Wishvale like >!Phenn at the graves, Stia tearfully elated at the progress it’s making on its comeback, and Laurana’s arc!<: also rewarding. The other >!“world” you explore!<, also a neat concept. These things saved it from the void, for me.

But overall, this game started, finished, and not only struggled to compel me to complete it, it struggled to bring me back to 0 after dipping below it for almost the entire experience.",0,1766422433.0,octopathtraveler,11,0.18,False

Just wanted to share my experience with the Jura Z10 that I purchased from William and Sonoma. It’s kinda crazy how much these shops push for Jura. We went to 4 different places and everyone was pushing for Jura as the best super automatic espresso machine. I won’t lie when we tried it, it was pretty solid especially coming from an automatic. I’m used to good coffee, my previous machine was a semi-automatic profitec pro 500 and a eureka mignon oro. So I had good coffee. But right now I don’t have time for a manual set up anymore. Honestly haven’t had time for over a year lol So I sold it and bought a jura z10.

Within the first week, the milk was sputtering. I scoured Reddit and found that this is a known issue. I tried to resolve it myself but couldn’t. So I called Jura, they sent me another frothing part. That didn’t work, so I was forced to ship the machine to Jura at no cost. Since we live in Chicago, I guess their repair shop is close by so we got the machine back within a week. They sent me a sheet of everything that was repaired, and guess what? The issue wasn’t resolved. That’s when I called William and Sonoma, expressed my frustration and they gave me another unit. I got the SAME issue with the new unit! Maybe William and Sonoma got a bad batch? Not sure. After talking to the Jura rep in my area and folks at William Sonoma they gave a full refund. The Jura rep even offered me 25% off another Z10 direct from their factory but I denied it. Issues happen in shipment, I get it. So maybe the units were damaged during shipment, who knows. But what bothered me is that I sent it to Jura and they didn’t fix it. That’s when I was skeptical about their repair service so I decided not to get another one. 

Then I found the KF8, sur la table a shop I have here in Chicago was able to demo the machine for me. And man I gotta hand it to KitchenAid, the espresso and lattes tasted way better Jura, and it’s wayyy cheaper. The build quality is better, it looks better in person, the milk frother is better, the touchscreen/interface is a night and day difference. I was solid immediately. My friend has a Gaggia accademia that I’ve tried, so I was about to pull the trigger on that. But the KF8 drinks tasted better than the Gaggia as well.  Only reason I wanted the Gaggia was because of the steam wand, but after trying the KF8s espresso the quality was so much better. 

So for those on the same journey as me. I highly recommend the KF8! Ask me questions if you like!",7,1766422385.0,superautomatic,8,0.89,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I’m a regular naltrexone user. I take 25mg a night to kill my video game addiction, which has been successful. I’m posting in this subreddit because r/naltrexone has gone quiet, you can only post with permission by the mods, and I cannot reach them. But I was hoping you can relate enough to my experience to answer.

I’m having vivid dreams when I take it at night, but if I take during the day I feel kind of cognitively impaired, very similar to being on an antipsychotic. Which I feel might be worse. When I take 12.5 in morning and 12.5 at evening I sleep fine. My question is, do these vivid dreams get better over time? I’ve taken it more than a month although I’ve experimented with several different methods so I haven’t necessarily been consistent. I might ask to increase my trazodone, which is for sleep. But what do you guys think? I’d hate for there to be no avenue for this to work out because it has changed my life with regard to video games, I can moderate easily now.

EDIT I should note that while it has negatively impacted my sleep, I am not in distress when I wake up and when I get up and have my coffee I can deal with it *okay*.",2,1766422317.0,LowDoseNaltrexone,1,1.0,False

1pt4edq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pt4edq/looking_for_next_step_up_from_breville_barista/,"Looking for next step up from Breville Barista Pro [$1500, w/grinder]","Hello all!  I've had a Breville Barista Pro since summer of 2020.  Machine has been, largely, decent, but I've had to make concessions as far as how good a shot I can get.  Essentially, I don't ever drink just straight espresso out of it, but it's been great for half-whites, lattes and Americano's.  In summer, I'd say 90% of the time I'm pulling shots for iced Americanos, and for that it's been really good.

Milk steaming has been fine, but even when I use a thermometer I the milk pitcher, I still get aggressive ""cooked"" milk on the wand and usually have to use the small tool to unclog the wand tip daily...which has taught me I do indeed need progressive lenses, but that's hardly the machines fault.

Frustrations with the machine are plenty: Difficult to dial in and the grinder has really shown its weakness.  Also, it feels weirdly inconsistent when it comes to brewing. I've had to pull 10+ shots trying to dial the thing in, and eventually gave up and just keep buying the same beans from the same roaster and ensuring they're approximately the same period of time after roasting, which has allowed me to not have to spend massive amounts of time on dialing in.  But even that has lead to pretty big seasonal needs to dial things in.  I typically use [https://jbccoffeeroasters.com/product/twisted-espresso/](https://jbccoffeeroasters.com/product/twisted-espresso/) beans that I get from them directly (they're close by), and rarely are they more than 2-3 weeks post-roast.

Shot times are inconsistent as well.  Sometimes it's 27 seconds, others it'll flirt with 40.  And, FWIW, I'm dosing using a scale, not leaving beans in the hopper. So every dose that goes in is always between 17.9-18.1g.

I upgraded to an open porta-filter from crema coffee.  I also use screens to help disperse the water better, so I'm not seeing channeling or the typically problems with a bad tamp or dosage.  Again, I come back to the grinder just being not great.  I've bought pre-ground coffee more than once, and that has improved consistency, but it's pre-ground so flavor isn't amazing if you don't burn the bag up quickly.

So, that all being said, it's time to upgrade.  The flow meter is toast on my Pro, and while I have a replacement on order, I think my plan will be to upgrade at home and move the Pro to my family cabin so I can use it when I'm there, but I'll need to remember to drain it fully before we winterize.

Requirements:

Budget: $1500, but that needs to include buying a grinder (probably getting a DF54).  I'm only using that machine 1-2 times a day, just to pull shots for me and the wife in the morning, and sometimes I'll do a half-calf shot in the afternoon or decaf in the evenings.  If a machine has a built in grinder that's really good, $1500 is fine. My hunch is I'll have \~$1200 to spend after I get a new grinder.

Size: I'd like to stay about the same footprint as the Barista Pro.

Features: Consistency? Is that a feature? A better steam wand experience would be nice, the all-or-nothing Pro wand isn't great.  Beyond that, I'd really like to be able to just hit a button (once it's dialed in) and get a consistent shot.  I know myself well enough to know that if I want to really taste some interesting single origin or whatever, I'll bust out the V60 or Chemex.  I just want good, consistent, espresso and the ability to not have to use a 200g of beans just to dial the damn thing in.

I'm in Madison WI, but I'm happy to go to Milwaukee or Chicago to purchase, especially if I can get into a really good machine that's used.

My water is fairly hard here, so descaling is a frequent need. I'd say I descale monthly right now just using softened water with descaled powder added to it.  I don't have a dedicated supply line for the machine, I have to fill w/a pitcher.

Lastly, not that expect to need to, but I'm happy to put a 120v 30A or 220v outlet in my kitchen for this.  I say that because I'm also about to upgrade to an induction range, and I need to run the wire for that anyways, so adding in a 2nd outlet for an espresso machine wouldn't be hard.

Note, I don't want an automatic or semi-auto.  I enjoy the process and like steaming milk myself.  If I didn't, I'd just get a Nespresso. :)

* ✅ 5 weights workouts
* ✅ no croissants
* ✅ no processed sugar
* ✅ meal prep (made ridiculous brownies)
* ❌ 12k steps weekly average (fell short: 11,720)
* ❌ no cardio sessions - did more weights workouts
* ❌ ate a load of fried foods (comfort eating)
* ❌ didnt track my calories
* ❌ failed a 36hour fast - bailed out after 24 hours
* ❌ find alternatives to eating for comfort

A mixed bag but overall I'm pleased with last week.  

I've broken my habit of getting croissants at the coffee shop.  
I'm free of the sugar cravings now but I'm tempted by **the idea** of having sugar. The siren call of getting some amazing cake from a local cake shop for xmas is very, very tempting. But I am going to resist and make some kind of sugar free cake or dessert instead. I know if I have the sugar it will lead to more sugar and then I'll have to go through the hard process of going sugar free again. 

I've still been looking to food for comfort - have been eating fried foods (chunky chips at the pub, indian snacks at a chai place), and I havent been tracking my calories. The fact the MyFitnessPal app has become pretty unusable now is not helping. I'll try and tighten things up this week.

I should have been more diligent about the step count. Fell short a bit but its still a miss. Also need to start doing cardio again. Steady state cardio is boring/frustrating to me, but I've got to get into the habit of doing it again.

I failed my fast this week, bailed out at the 24 hour mark. 

Its Xmas week of course which has its own challenges. I've bought a load of veg and hope I will be showing restraint and still enjoying myself.

I'd rate the past week as:  Hibernating Bear - 6, Hunting Wolf - 4  


Here is the plan for the weekahead:

* 12k steps (weekly average)
* 3 weights workouts (Progressive overload!)
* 2 low intensity cardio workouts (30 mins on the bike)
* 1 higher intensity cardio workout - for fun and energy (jump rope, burpees, kettlebells)
* no sugar (make: sugar free desserts instead)
* no deep fried food (make roasted veg instead)
* meal prep & cooking (air popped popcorn, roasted vegs, pasta)

I think I can do this. Xmas is tricky though and if you are struggling with your health goals at this time of year just do the best you can. Any win counts as a double win this week.

And yet, there’s a very specific kind of emptiness that job doesn’t fill. The absence of someone to come home to and have deep conversation. I miss the simple intimacy of checking in: “How was your day, really?” The kind of coffee talk that starts with small updates and ends somewhere deeper. Hopes, fears, silly stories, and the comfort of being understood without having to perform. 

I’m ambitious and career-oriented, and I’m proud of the life I’m building. But ambition can be loud, and the heart needs softer things too! Emotional support, warmth, presence. Lately that’s been missing, and I’ve felt it more because many of my close friends have moved away from Mumbai, making the city feel a little less like “home” in the ways that matter.

So this is me, putting it out there with honesty and intention: I’d like to connect with a woman in Mumbai who also values depth. Someone open to friendship that can naturally grow into dating if the energy is right. No rush, no games, no pretence. Just two people choosing sincerity, and seeing what unfolds.

But the past couple days I have been so overwhelmed by like 9am that I just pack both boys in the car, drive to my fav coffee place, and when we get back home I just let my 1 year old play in the car and drink my coffee while my 1 month old sleeps.

Anyway I don’t know if this helps anyone else but it’s been a nice breather for when I’m overwhelmed and just needs both kids to be happy for a little while I drink my coffee(:",7,1766421730.0,2under2,0,1.0,False

After she got out of a 3 year relationship she kind of got in contact with me again. A few weeks after that I was out with my friends and we bumped into each other and the next day I asked her out for coffee. It went well and after she asked me what my intentions were. Blinded by lust, a problem which I've since then worked on I foolishly implied I wanted to be friends with benefits without saying it directly. She said that if we can't be friends we shouldn't talk anymore and I assured her that it wasn't a strong enough feeling that it would get between us being friends.

Eventually she got more and more distant which is understandable because in her mind I still had feelings for her and she maybe didn't want to give me the wrong idea or have things escalate.

So, yesterday (a couple months after our reconnection) I was out at a club with my friends and we ran into each other again. I didn't do any advances or imply anything nor did I want to, but I was pretty drunk and really enthusiastic to run into her and stuff. Enough that now I fear I've given her the wrong idea again...

For background: My MIL has bullied me for years. When I finally told her how hurt I was, she escalated badly: she told me my wedding was the worst day of her life, insulted my parents, told my husband he never wanted to marry me, and demanded I return the necklace she gave me when I got engaged (which I did).

My FIL is also awful to me so I’ve been NC from him for even longer. 

Recently MIL has been pushing to “meet for a coffee” to “move forward.” I’ve refused via DH unless she acknowledges that she said things which were out of line, because the last “coffee” ended with her being extremely insulting. I’ve blocked her on email and WhatsApp due to past abusive messages.

I’ve also just had a miscarriage after a 2-year IVF journey, so I’m emotionally exhausted.

Today I saw this email she sent my husband (it was open on his computer).

Here is the full email she sent him:

“Dearest \[husband\],

All I want is to meet \[me\] on a friendly platform. To have a nice coffee, chat and catch up, simply as a mother-in-law/daughter-in-law friendly meeting. You and \[me\] have already told me multiple times that \[me\] wants to move forward and “not dwell on the past”, so this is the only way forward for us if we are to have a harmonious, friendly, normal relationship.

This is so important for us all particularly you, as I am sure that your life must be dreadful living with her nagging and criticizing not only us but your wonderful sisters and brothers-in-law who have behaved impeccably towards her at all times, inviting her round and being kind, inclusive and friendly.

And you know this.

This will be my 4th attempt to reach out to \[me\]. The previous 3 have been complete failures because \[me\] behaved appallingly and totally unprovoked towards me.

You are simply trying to give in to \[me\] constant gas lighting and narcissistic personality which will never resolve the situation. We will NOT go over the past.

So the only way forward as I have told you multiple times is:

	1.	Tell her to unblock me from her emails NOW, so that I can send her a nice friendly email to meet up, and let’s move forward. You know that she really doesn’t want to and you are trying to make me the bad person here. You are being gaslit by her.

	2.	Tell her to let me know when we can meet up for a nice friendly coffee as I have suggested.

	3.	Be true to yourself. See the wicked, mixed up, disturbed person \[me\] is.

	4.	Look at her genes. What hope is there for you and if you were to have children.

	5.	You know all I want is to have a nice relationship with my daughter-in-law. This does not have to include Dad at this stage.

	6.	Please reflect carefully on your life ahead and do not suffer alone.

Love

Mum”

She says she wants to “move forward,” but in the same email she calls me wicked/disturbed, accuses me of gaslighting, and attacks my genes and future children.

I’ve also tried to “move on” many times but she always has a long list of “crimes” than I’ve done (like not put in enough effort) - even though I really tried my best!

So, do I respond or stay NC? I’m so angry I really want to vent but don’t know if that will make the situation worse.

I (14M) have a friend group with ""L"" (14M) and a few others. Lately, I’ve realized L treats me less like a friend and more like tech support.

Here is the context:

He barely texts me to hang out, but calls me immediately when he needs me to fix his phone (sideloading apps, etc). If I don't fix it, he gets annoyed.

He does things to ""test"" me. For example, he once stole a bunch of coffee creamers, refused to give me one, then threw half of one on my desk and tried to force me to throw it out for him. When I refused, he called me a baby. In games, he constantly griefs me (spamming shock sticks, etc). Yesterday, he asked if he could write a nickname with my name on a sign in a game. I didn't answer.

Because of this, I’ve been pulling back and hanging out with another friend, ""M,"" who actually treats me normally.

L noticed I was distant and ignored me for a few days. Yesterday at 1 AM, he sent me a huge text saying I have been ""rude,"" ""mocking,"" and ""exasperating"" lately. He explicitly admitted: ""I have been trying to ignore you because of these actions so could you try to work on it."" Basically, he admitted he was giving me the silent treatment to punish me and ""teach me a lesson.""

I replied: ""I’m not trying to be mean for no reason, but I am pulling back because I don’t like how things feel right now. The constant testing and the way you talk to me is exhausting. If you want us to stop drifting apart, the way you treat me has to change.""

I feel like I might be the AH because I have been sarcastic and distant lately to defend myself, and my latest text is justifying MY behavior by attacking his.

AITA for sending that text?

You need to place your order for pickup in Luke's in the Williams hardware booth right of the diner while you pass it in the queue.

10.20 photos taken by the truck and in front of Luke's  
10.30 went to Lorelais queue (30mins, also more like 20 mins)  
10.50 back at Luke's to get my coffee lol (60 mins advertised)  
11.37 I placed my order (they were already out of cherry Danish, lemon loaf and cinnamon loaf)  
I got coffee and a cinnamon donut which was really good (and big). Not a donut fan but it really was good.  
11.50 sitting near the gazebo for a bit with my coffee and donut just taking it all in  
Around noon there were 30 minute or more lines for most places (dragonfly, doose's, Gilmore Estate etc)

The tree lighting + snow is nice. Be there a bit early. Carolers will be around. Emily Kuroda gave a little speech. Scott was there in different locations, spotted him from far.

The Stars Hollow projection was beautiful  + snow

I, 29F and my boyfriend 48M live together and I always felt that he is not very caring or romantic. I feel that he treats me like a roommates most of the time. 

I earn significantly more than him but still I would like to have some romantic gestures from him. Nothing special but be taken on dates or reciveing gifts from time to time.  However he never offered any of this things since we started dating (5 years ago) and he even asks me for gas money when I need a car ride. He also would let me walk my myself at night from work, when he could offer to go take me. 

Despite not needing to be provided for anything I've been growing some resentment.
He has a 18 kid that I understand that it's his priority.
We rent a house but I will be buying a house by myself, since he cannot afford to help and he would move with me as well. 

We had a discussion where I told him he shouldn't treat me as a roommate because one day I will be taking care of him and it wouldn't be fair to spend my last days taking care of someone that would never buy me a coffee and does nothing for me. I just feel that I would be better off alone despite loving him.

He is upset and does not want to talk to me, and says that he I would never need me to take care of him when he grows older and is offended by my comment. 

So, Am I the asshole for being frustrated with my boyfriend and the way I expressed it?

Edit: I just want to add that despite making more money, I don't support my boyfriend financially as everything is split evenly

I’m 60 F, and would like to lose 25 lbs to get back to my previous lifelong weight.  (140 lbs) Afrer a few months just trying to eliminate carbs where possible (removing buns and bread from burgers/sandwiches and trying for more protein based breakfasts), in early November I quit all sugar and alcohol (very moderate drinker, but a habit to drink a hard cider on stressful eves). 

Two weeks later I started keto, following along in a 4-week class of being taught the basics. The main guidelines were to start the day with fat (cream in coffee etc), 3:1 fat:protein ratio, no carbs at bfast, 20 g or less if carbs, lots of water, lots of electrolytes once in ketosis). 

I got in ketosis pretty quickly, and have been tracking glucose and ketones through carb manager. A few times I have caved in the evening (some pizza etc) and see how I’m out of ketosis the next morn but usually back in by lunch.

I have been very good about no sugar either with the exception of a little dark chocolate.

I have sadly not been exercising. Life and days have been full, or… lately I have had energy crashes in afternoon or after dinner. Maybe not enough sleep. Too much stress. Just fried, melting into the couch. 

Anyhow, I went from 164 to 160, was thrilled to hit 158 last week, and now back up to 160. In six weeks. 

It sounds like lots of people would have dropped a lot more by now.

I’m also suddenly constipated the past few days,.. have been drinking a ton of Ultima electrolytes in hopes of relieving this, but no luck so far.

I’m kind of shocked that I haven’t lost more just through the total elimination of sugar and so low carbs.

I am finding it very easy to get lots of fat, but struggling to get enough protein that doesn’t also add more fat.

Any suggestions? I’m feeling discouraged and wavering at this holiday time.

1pt3yzw,https://v.redd.it/0ly1i17w8s8g1,"2025 Wrapped for the MPYAA, a nonprofit for young adults in southern Brooklyn","2025 was a year of growth, service, and community building beyond what we imagined. What began in June 2024 as an idea to create something that didn’t quite exist in southern Brooklyn — a space where young adults (18-35) could meet new people and feel part of something bigger — has grown into a thriving community.

In February, we kicked off the year with a winter coat drive at Marine Park Coffee, collecting over 100 coats, scarves, gloves, and boots for Community Heartbeat Foundation to support survivors of domestic violence across southern Brooklyn. In May, we followed with a second drive collecting essential items. By August, more than 20 volunteers packed over 100 backpacks for children impacted by domestic violence.

Alongside our service work, the Association continued to grow internally. We now have 22 registered members, a formal membership structure, adopted bylaws, and shared decision-making processes that guide how we operate. Climate Cafe South Brooklyn operates under the Association as a DBA, advancing our social welfare mission through facilitated, nonpartisan conversations on climate change.

Throughout the year, we hosted social and community events that brought young adults together from across southern Brooklyn. From movie nights and game nights to trivia, karaoke, concerts, volunteer drives, and casual meetups, our goal has been to create welcoming, low-pressure spaces where people can connect.

Our open community events also brought people of all ages together, including Live Music at the Gather Inn Again in April and October and a free outdoor Movie Night at the Lott House.

In November, over 30 volunteers joined us for Marine Park Street Tree Care Day with NYC Parks, caring for more than 20 street trees, with a Part II planned for next year.

We’re grateful to our local partners: Nick Grasso of Marine Park Coffee, Jaime DeNardo of The Gather Inn Again, and Jane Carbonaro for their support.

I got diagnosed with subclinical hypo earlier this year and currently in the process of finding the right dose. Levothyroxine isn’t having the exact impact my PCP and I were expecting, and my TSH is fighting our dose increases.

I started in May on 25mcg (original TSH 4.94) and then increased to 50 mcg in August (TSH was 3.65 at time of increase). After my retest in October, my TSH was 3.19. So, we increased again to 50/75 mcg alternating. I just got results back and my TSH went UP to 3.42. 

Is there anything that could cause my TSH to artificially look higher? I don’t take supplements with biotin and always wait 45 mins-1 hour until I have coffee. FT3 and T4 are in range.

1pt3x84,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1pt3x84/advice_needed/,Advice needed,"I (19M) am a bi guy. And I think I might have a thing for my gay bestfriend (19M).

My Context (or just scroll to the situation) 
I’m Half French and Half South African, I grew up inbetween a lot of countries, but most of my life was between South Africa, Dubai and Qatar (which for LGBTQ matters are still largely conservative societies). So I largely refrained from pursuing guys and just focused on dating girls cause it was easier. 

Recently my grandparents moved back to New York City and I moved with them as I want to go to college in the US. NYC was so fun and I learnt a lot about my own queerness and type and all that. So much to the point where I got the courage to come out.

But my South African dad grew up in NYC and has been very accepting since I came out last spring. My mom not so much, they’re divorced so it’s not like a big issue (I only see her once a year during the winter holidays) but I usually used to talk to her about girl issues and I feel like she wouldn’t be comfortable talking about guy issues in the same way so here I am. 

I’m still new to the openly queer scene and started in college (I’m a sophomore). 

The Situation 
Going to college in the Midwest (Chicago area) and I’ve made a tight knit friend group. A girl and two guys. My female friend (F20) is also bi. My male friends (19M) and (18M) are gay and trans respectively. So it’s the most queer people I’ve been around at any one point. I always say like they’re too cool for me, I really love them all. We share clothes (they have insane style) and go on walks together and smoke. We’re all flying to Italy together in January and then Aspen together in Spring break (my grandparents have a timeshare place). So there’s a lot at stake, especially if I’m just reading into his actions and it’s one sided. I don’t wanna ruin my first happy friend group situation. 

But istg whenever the three of us (me, 20F and 19M) or with our 18M friend (he hangs w us on and off) hang out it’s perfectly chill. But when it’s just me and my gay bestfriend idk the vibe feels weirdly charged. 

Exhibit A
He’s the only one of my friends who’s from Chicago, the rest of my friends are from other states/countries. And because my parents don’t live in the US, I kinda have free reign and usually stay for as long as possible on campus (my grandparents in nyc are super laissez faire and wouldn’t mind whether or not I stay w them). So like over the summer I spent a huge chunk of time in Chicago and so we would hang out like usual. Go to the same spots on campus and off campus that we usually go to, but idk if it felt romantic or like going on a date or smth. He’d keep eye contact while I talked which is unusual for him because he would never look at me during our group hangouts. So we got really close last summer and we’d hangout like every weekend. We went to a ‘couples’ lantern lighting event together and that was nice. We were sitting in the sand as the sun set and he laid his head on my shoulder. And I think it was that evening that he gave me that adrenaline spike for the first time cause everything before then just felt standard but atp I started to feel something stirring in me. 

Exhibit B 
Same summer we went to some museums and coffee shops just to hang out. And idk id never done it before but I would pay everything all the time. And he wouldn’t say anything and ig that made it feel more like they were dates but idk maybe im overreaching. 

Exhibit C
He has a guitar and he sang a few love songs to me while we were high on the balcony of my dorm and our legs were intertwined cause we were sharing the one chair on my balcony. That felt nice imo, the body contact. That same night he slept over in my dorm (I had a single) and we cuddled with our legs intertwined and I was playing with his hair. While he was sleeping I gave his hair like a soft kiss that idk if he noticed, he probably didn’t. 

Exhibit D 
After that night he became kind of sexual, and he said he was just matching my freak lol (because my friends are always making fun of me for being the overly sexual friend) but we went to a park near his house and he started listing off places he’d think in the park would be good spots to cruise or make out w someone. That conversation kinda solidified that I felt something towards him because as he was describing like doing all this w guys like in the bushes and like in the bathroom I started getting hard and I think he might’ve noticed cause afterwards he wanted us to keep walking but like I stayed sat a couple more seconds because.. y’know and that was an awkward couple of seconds. 

Exhibit E
Near the beginning of the new school year we went to a lake, one of our college friends had a lake house and threw like a welcome week party and so we all went as well. And so I’m mixed (half-white and half-black), my skin is pretty light but I’m not white by any means so I’ve kinda skimped out on sunscreen over the years but he’s white and he asked me to sunscreen his back while our immediate friends were in the water. So idk his skin was super smooth and so I kinda took my opportunity, I started rubbing the sunscreen lower and lower on his back, until I met the waistline of his swim shorts and I slipped my thumb past it and he didn’t say anything and then I bit of my hand as well and he didn’t say anything but I felt his body like send a shiver thru his body. And then I made a joke about how if he wants me to lotion his buttcheeks that’ll be an extra twenty and he like laughed it off. 

Now a couple of days ago he asked to room w me in the airbnb we’re staying at in Italy and I said ofc np, I was like just let me know when u want me out of the room if u wanna have a guy over or smth and then he responded im not really into hooking up with strangers lol I stick to people I know. And istg his eyes lingered on me. And I responded well if u know anyone else who’ll be in Italy at that time you should hit them up. Idk if that was a stupid response lol. 

Now last night. We hung out, all three of us, then we dropped off our female friend at the airport cause she’s from Connecticut and we’re both staying in Illinois for a couple more days. So I asked him if we wanted to come over to my dorm and he did and we played monopoly and then I gave him his Christmas gift because his family was leaving the cities to go up north somewhere where they have a cabin or smth. 

He just burst out snd started crying after I surprised him with the gift and he said that I made him feel seen and loved in a way no one before. Then we hugged it out and I took a gamble and gave him a small forehead kiss and when I looked down his pupils were so dilated and his lips were parted and idk I felt like I should’ve done smth, idk if I should’ve kissed him or smth but I didn’t. Instead I asked him if he wanted me to help his set up the guitar amp (that’s one of the gifts I got him). He left a bit after midnight and the whole time we didn’t speak much but it was a good silence but I do wish that I had had the balls to make some kind of a move. 

Obviously this was super long I apologise just haven’t been able to tell anyone this and I’m really glad to have this off my chest. 

So what would u advise I do? Talk to my female friend? Confront my male friend? Wait until the  trip or after or even after spring break? Or just stop thinking about it and just let it go? Idk any advice is appreciated

Adderall made me very shaky and my anxiety was really bad. I also drank a ton of coffee in college the last time I was on it. So we talked about trying something new, which was vyvanse. When I first started on it, I had been off Adderall for a few years. So maybe it was just not being on a stimulant for so long. 

In the beginning it seemed to be working but my executive dysfunction was still a major obstacle for me. (Also the reason I got put back on a stimulant to begin with). So we increased it every so often. In the beginning it seemed to help but not like Adderall used to. We thought maybe the dose was too low. So over time we slowly bumped up the dose. By the time I got off of it, I was on a fairly high dose. However I stopped getting any benefits from the medication. My executive dysfunction seemed untouched again. I just barely felt a difference. 

I often forget my meds in the morning so I could definitely tell when I didnt take it. My focus was obviously worse, and I would usually ask myself why today was unusually hard to get through. So it clearly made some difference but it just wasnt anywhere what it was the first few months. I was just shocked at the decrease in affect the meds had on me. Especally something like a stimulant i didnt think that was really possible. I do have severe ADHD. I was diagnosed around 4 or 5 years old. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced somthing like this? Ive only ever been on these 2 stimulants. Ive been a lot of ADHD meds tho. ",2,1766420849.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I tried it in the summer and failed on Day 1. 

What has worked so far: 

\- not going cold turkey - I tried that at first but I just felt like I was missing out on content related to my actual interestest. I follow football and AI news and youtube / podcasts are some of the best sources of content, so quickly changed from cold turkey to a short, daily window when I was allowed to consume some content. 

\- hard rules:   
1. no listening / watching apart from 20:00 - 21:30   
2. no stacking - if I want to watch / listen to something, that is the only thing I am doing. Not while walking the dog or cleaning the house 

\- remove temptation with tools - blocker for all devices, incl. apps and websites to enforce the time restriction + blocker for youtube, which takes me straight to subscriptions

\- realizing that I used dopamine for to surpress difficult emotions - when I was anxious I just jumped on the youtube carousel until I forgot about the emotions. Once I started catching myself in the attempt to open the app and realising why I was doing that I started thinking of how else I can deal with the emotion, either breathing, stretching, walking or writing. 

What I observed: 

\- the first couple of days were really hard, but then the pull less and less surprisingly quickly

\- I started to have more energy - even though I considered the listening / watching as relaxation, it still consumed my attention, so at the end of the day I feel better

\- I am less irritable - previously small thing in life not going my way could really derail my mood, now I feel more resilient, get less angry with my son

\- I look forward to daily pleasures more - things like meals, coffee, being outside, speaking to people. Things that previously could turn into annoyances, because they kept me away from my digital addictions are now something I look forward to. 

\- my HRV has gone up by about 10 points - I generally sleep very well anyways, but according to my watch I am more relaxed at night. I have no way of proving that this is what has caused it, but it went up about 7 days into my detox and has stayed up since then. 

\- the automated blockers are key - since I used to get dopamine from the anticipation of new content on youtube / podcasts, the fact that I cannot check it removes the dopamine. When I used to try to willpower it, it was like a torture. 

\- over time I have added more blockers - I started with youtube and podcasts, but later also added sport scores. I think that if I blocked everything at once it would have been to hard to adhere to

1pt3pmj,https://i.redd.it/9dvkctj17s8g1.jpeg,"The pain of networking, talking and mingling with highly successful Professional Elite Circles. Self- Esteem, ADHD, Mental Health Career Setbacks and Class in the UK.","We can not ignore the impact of mental health and neurodiversity on successfulness (or expectations of it). Professionals focus on education as a success metric but even with it, good career barriers are way too high in UK. 

Great Education ≠ Success - especially if you're from a lower class background. A history of neurodiversity, trauma and mental health issues makes it feel near impossible.

Many from a lower class backgrounds who made it to Russell Group (Ivy Legue equivalent) universities and had neurodiversity and/or mental health troubles I believe can relate to this. 

Years back, I managed to squeeze myself at a top elite uni for postgraduate studies. Whilst I was there I never felt so alone, everyone screamed success already. They were able to navigate, network and secure opportunities. I couldn't. Half my uni events were pseudoinvestment parties and one's poverty becomes straight up exclusionary. 

Trying to be around those people after my studies was even worse as I felt that even with distinction-level work, I was the unemployed failure. Even with lots of education - I found that scaling careers can be harder than managing academic expectations - especially when self-esteem, rejection sensitivity and job changes in my CV scream ADHD and gaps scream mental health problems.

On top of the class barriers- you are your own worse enemy. Your education and peers create high expectations and your fragile self-esteem and reality crushes you when you can't get there. Being unemployed and on pause feels better than working a dead end job knowing the many years of education mean nothing and you would be a loser for life. 

Calling yourself self-employed or becoming a perpetual student is the best way to cope with people's perception of you. After all academia is predictable, they give you extensions when needed and you're at least not NEET. 

When I've tried to mingle in black tie events and in highly successful neurotypical circles (finance, policy, MPs and others), especially with classy types I almost feel my social class, my past and neurodiversity makes me persona non grata- one feels the need to pretend they are something they're not. I'm cheap, my suit is cheap and I have £5 in my name. I don't belong here.

Sometimes you can't avoid these people and have to bear with the imposter syndrome, their cringeness, your envy and damage to your self-worth. They talk about their £100 imported coffee beans when you tell them that your peasant Starbucks coffee is nice today. They're not bad people. They're just loaded. If you want to go anywhere in many career fields, these are the people you need to be around.

You want to have a great and impactful career, you want to use your advanced skills and be high up in society making a change, rent a nice appartment in London have a good professional network that benefits you and make money- but you know you can't. You can't even spend a minute with these people without feeling inadequate.

The fact that half of your peers have managed to be successful and you haven't just destroys you.",7,1766420496.0,neurodiversity,0,0.82,False
1pt3pih,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1pt3pih/drink_over_christmas/,Drink over Christmas.,"I don't like complaining, and I don't like coming to the whinging subreddit but here I am to whinge and complain. Ireland's culture around drinking is bad enough but I find it especially awful around Christmas. Everywhere I go I see people drinking or talking about drinking. Staff Christmas Parties, Mammys leaving Supervalu with 7 bottles of wine, Christmas Eve Pints, people who don't like Baileys having it on their cornflakes on Christmas morning. 

For me, Christmas is a time to be spent with family, giving gifts, watching movies, playing games, going out to meet extended family, not sneaking whiskey into your morning coffee while the kids unwrap their presents and not to piss off to the pub on St. Stephen's Day.

Maybe I am alone with this sentement, but it feels like getting sloshed on Christmas Day is way too normal.
