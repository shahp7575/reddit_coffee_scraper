1ifvz15,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1ifvz15/do_women_fall_in_blind_love_at_all/,Do women fall in blind love at all?,"I personally had 3 women in my life I could say I fell in blind love with, with about a 10 year interval. One at age 6, one at 15, and one at 27. I was painting them. I wrote songs and poetry about them and had romantic dreams. Those feelings were inspiring me to create, and also when I thought about ever having kids, I could imagine having them only with those women. They were so beautiful to me. And yeah to me they were pretty af but I was dating a literal miss Utah too (not one of those 3 kek) and I didn't feel anything close to what I felt when I REALLY was in love. 

None of the 3 ever loved me back choosing ""better options"", and also I look at the current perceived state of the dating market and it's so difficult to understand how to be loved. Like, even if I  had all the money and all success in the world, how is that even connected with someone falling in unconditional love with me? 

Do women even feel that kind of love? Not because ""he's from a good family and has a nice job and a social circle and runs a business"", but just because brain goes ""bro I don't care but here's a bunch of butterflies in the stomach and a coffee, sit down we recording a song about her eyes"". 

I'd think it was a teenage thing but I've had it at 27 lol. After our first date I LITERALLY saw her damn eyes for the entire night when I was closing my eyes. And yeah she just went back to her more expensive husband she divorsed earlier.

It feels like the whole social discussion about dating is about ""sex vs resources vs abuse, choose what you're ok with"", but like... blind fucking love. isn't that a thing anymore? I never see women talk about it. Do they even feel this?

Sorry this is so long but I'm curious what other people think of the topic. maybe share your personal stories or research/art, idc.

1ifvy3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1ifvy3u/coffee_on_sr_is_a_cheat_code/,Coffee on SR is a cheat code,"I'm currently been retaining for around 60 days now with one relapse unfortunately before the new year.

  
I have noticed some insane benefits like many people have posted in this community. Standouts for me personally have been:

* Increased energy. My energy levels are through the roof and this has allowed me to work full-time, go gym everyday and work on my side hustles. I am also more careful and selective about how I expend my energy.
* Increased fearlessness. I am jumping into challenges more willingly. For example in the gym with my lifts and doing hard tasks such as working after a tiring day at work. I play cricket recreationally and the other day my coach increased the speed of bowling drastically to 135kph and I didn't shy away from the challenge.
* Increased attraction from women. At my new workplace, I definitely get choosing signals and indicators of interest from women. I have had some what can I only call *odd* interactions with women. It felt like a couple of girls were intimidated by me and this is the first time this has happened in my life. I have always been known as an easy-going, laid back and kind person.
* Increased eye contact. This one is a classic which I feel comes from the lack of shame which I get from not engaging in PMO.
* Goal orientation. I am focussed on achieving my goals. I review daily and align all my actions towards achieving big goals I have set for 2025. These include getting my finances up, paying off debts, completing the first year of my postgraduate degree etc.

So anyway, regarding the coffee. I am trying to cut down on coffee and try to only drink 1-2 cups per day. However, some days when I'm just struggling to get things done like go gym or tidy my room, I get a latte from Costa in the afternoon. My energy levels are already high from SR but this just skyrockets my energy. I try to use it sparingly though as I'm really trying to get a good baseline of energy and wellbeing from being on SR.

Anyway, thank you for reading. I just wanted to share. God bless.",2,1738498316.0,Semenretention,0,1.0,False

I first met her at the end of November. So we have been involved in a play for the last while. I would see a couple of times a week. We have been getting on very well, gone on a few coffee dates and had drinks together. There is certainly chemistry there. 

Anyway it was my turn to drive yesterday to where we going with the whole group. Just as she was getting out of the car I said I really liked her. She smiled and said thank you. She said that she was a slow burner, which I understood and she appreciated our friendship. She said then could we still be friends and I said of course. 

We parted ways then and I drove on home. 

I am fairly down over it all being honest. I don’t know is this the door closed altogether or what. We will see each other again for sure. I wasn’t awkward about it but I feel I have made things very awkward possibly.

Just some advice for the newbies.,"I see this in a lot of discussions about diets, recovery, and ostomy products. I think it’s great to see everyone make suggestions and offer support-it’s what makes this group great and advice is usually really good! 

For diets-some of can eat certain things while some of us can’t. I hear all the time about the big nos of eating (veggies, nuts, fruit, seeds, popcorn..). I’m prone to blocks so I can’t eat any of these unless it’s peeled and deseeded, even then I can only have like a bite. BUT some people can have whole ass salads topped with nuts and seeds. (Jealous!) 

There are certain foods I feel like cause some same effects in majority of us. Like potatoes, marshmallows, bananas, starchy things will thicken output. And fizzy drinks can cause gas or thin output. I personally drink coffee and multiple sodas in a day. I also eat a lot of sugar and desserts since I’m pretty underweight and it’s the best way to get calories.

All that said-you won’t know what you can or can’t drink until you try it. I’m not suggesting try eating a huge salad and steak the day you get out of the hospital but after recovering and your bowels are working just try small bites of something and chew really well! You’ll find out what you can or can’t handle.

As far as product go, there’s not one brand that will magically work for anyone (as cool as that would be). It’s like Goldilocks trying to find what works for you. I suggest calling the major ones and getting as many samples as you can. It took me a few months before I found my “perfect” combo and they’re not even all the same brands. 

Anyways-if you read this far, thanks for listening! This group does offer great advice and support, 4 years later I still have questions and things to learn. ",4,1738497347.0,ostomy,0,1.0,False

I've been there for 1.5 years but have recently an offer to join another T2 as a senior consultant (i.e. a promotion.)

**Keen on the community's perspectives on what decision to take.**

1. Pay

New gig is $25k higher than my current role and $12k higher than the SC pay at my current place

2. Culture

Old place:

Minimal senior leadership presence in the office. Occasional social events. I've tried to push for more of an outgoing, beers after work type of vibe but there hasn't been any real buy-in except for 1 or 2 others as most are 30+ or already engaged. Juniors may come in once or twice a week. WLB has been consistently pretty shit with lots of late hours (12am+) unless you hit the lottery.

New place:

Have had a lot of coffee chats with the new team and there is 90% attendance in the office. More of a younger crowd and people hang out with each other outside of work.

3. Type of work/Development

Old place: A lot of DDs (4 week sprints) but now also doing lots of transformation (digital + enterprise) including loooong implementation phases. A lot of senior exposure and learning. Toolkit developed thus far has been mostly qualitative with little opportunity to flex quant muscles. Have been siloed into 1 or 2 industries. Headcount growing super quickly and revenue growing (20%+)

New place: Most projects are 8-10 weeks in commercial growth and strategy. Specialise in 2-3 industries, but i am more interested in them. Learning would mostly be from M/SM/D/SDs as opposed to MDs. Workstreams are more much quantitative with a lot of work in SQL/Tableau Headcount growth quite stable but revenue steadily increasing (10-20%)

4. Promotion

Old place: Promotion candidate for this upcoming cycle (Dec) but with up and out culture a bit scared of screwing up and getting put on a PIP. Only have annual promotion cycles. Have some backers but don't have anyone in the senior level that feels like a ride or die.  
New place: Would be given a promotion with the new job and they have 6 month promotion cycles which means faster growth

5. Location

Old place: Melbourne, where I am close to friends and family. Currently living at home so minimal rent + expenses to save up for a house. Originally moved from uni to Melbourne to spend more time with aging parents.

New place: Sydney - would need to move to a new city where i don't know anyone + $60k in living expenses

**Initial view:** Gut feel is leaning towards the new job given the guaranteed promotion, better culture, better types of work and development culture, but scared of moving to Sydney and away from family, especially with new living expenses creating delays in first home buying timeline + less time with family/friends. Long term plan is to start a family in Melbourne eventually, so moving to Sydney would feel like putting my life on hiatus.

At the same time, not sure if just drinking the new company koolaid or not and if its just the case that I'm jaded and all consultancies are the same - although in my own personal life i am yet to meet an MBB/T2/B4 consultant who doesn't hate their life.",1,1738497083.0,auscorp,0,1.0,False

We ended up going for coffee. He set up the time and place and we texted a little everyday on the lead up to coffee. 

At coffee we talked for 2 hours. We had fun and he asked me a ton of questions. I also feel like he would have offered to get my drink for me if I hadn’t gotten there first and ordered before. 

After coffee we texted everyday for about a week until it slowly tapered off. Sometimes he will like my Instagram photos. 

We have no overlapping social circles or anything so it doesn’t really make sense to be friends.

In all our interactions I always got the feeling that he found me attractive. Was he just trying to suss things out in a low pressure way?

1ifvhes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1ifvhes/no_due_date_please_proofread_my_short_story/,[no due date] please proofread my short story,"Cat’s Head


I grew up in a small town set in a “bowl” of mountains in the Appalachians. There was one 30 minute drive over the east mountains that you could take to get to real civilization. But for the most part we stayed in Cat’s Head. No one could really say why it was called that, some said it was the name of an old moonshiner who had a cabin somewhere in the mountains, others said it had something to do with the Indians but didn’t know why. I didn’t know then but I know now that people didn’t get old here often, round here most people don’t know that there’s anything else besides blue collar work. You work here till you can’t work anymore then you take up your garden and live the simple life for the few years you got left.

CHAPTER ONE 

It was the beginning of fall, the time when we get a few lost tourists driving into town trying to find the Blue Ridge Parkway. I never understood how they wind up here in Cats Head you’d think at some point in the drive to nowhere you’d realize your mistake but I always supposed the parkway is a bit of a drive to nowhere.

I was 25 years old, sworn in the year before by the new Sheriff John Whitaker. He was the only candidate as he was the only Deputy at the time the old Sheriff had tragically passed away in a car accident . So he was a shoe in. Although young, John was a good man, we grew up together. He was a few years older than me and if it weren’t a town that you didn’t know everybody we might’ve been mistaken as brothers. Both blonde hair blue eyed and dimples that the our mothers always said ladies would love but seeing as I didn’t have a highschool sweetheart anymore I figured I was out of luck in that department in this town. 

I got to work that day and John was already in our patrol car, an old lifted jeep. Not great for transporting criminals but we didn’t do that nearly as much as we had to off-road to get to houses much like the one we were about to go to.
“Get in we gotta go up the mountain to the Johnson’s house. Had a call on the answer machine that sounded like Genny Johnson.” John told me as I got out of my car.

“Did he taste too much of his latest batch of moonshine?” I asked semi-jokingly as he was known to drink his product and slap Genny around. He used to be able to get out of jail by promising to give the old Sheriff a batch of shine. I suppose it was sort of posting bond but it wasn’t something John was gonna put up with now that he was Sheriff.

“No all she said was “He’s dead please get up here”

“Damn, no name or information? You’re sure we are going to the right place?” I asked as we pulled onto the road with the lights and sirens on.

“If I didn’t know her distressed voice by now I wouldn’t be much of a cop”

We drove up the small two lane that lead back towards the real civilization of Henderson County before turning off and heading up a small dirt road that lead to the Johnson’s. An abandoned car with out of state plates sat part way in the ditch beside the road a white shirt hung in the window.

“Was there a call about this car?” I asked 

“No but who calls 911 about running out of gas? Plus unless you know our offices number 911 calls go to the next town over so we probably would never hear about it. I’m sure they hitched a ride to town and will get back here when they can.”

“I suppose that’s true. Just figured tourists would be the first to call us over being the dumbass that forgot to fill up before the parkway.” I laughed.


We pulled up to the Johnsons house and got out of the car walked up to the house and knocked on the open door.

“Sheriffs Office!”

No reply. No movement in the house. 

“Go check the shed I’ll check the house.” John ordered.

I headed around the back walked up to the shed. It was a small plank barn with the door open. Normally Kenny Johnson kept it padlocked as his beloved still was in there. “Sheriffs Office!” I called as I walked to the door but there was no movement or response again. I walked in the door, the smell hitting me before my eyes realized what I was looking at. 

There was Kenny Johnson the moonshining wife beater. His body laying next to his still, his chest ripped open and his intestines were hanging from the rafters like streamers at a party. 

I’ve seen my share of bodies in the short time as a Deputy but this made me spew my breakfast all over the grass outside the shed. I ran back to the front of the house just in time to see John step out of the open front door and do the same as me. 

“J-john it’s bad, Kenny is-is, I-I don’t know what I just saw.” I puked again the image of Kenny’s body flashed in my mind.

John stood up wiping his mouth. “Gennys no better” he pulled his phone out and quickly put it away. “No service” he paused a moment before putting his hand to his nose and going back inside. I followed him in covering my nose. He went and got on the landline phone dialed 911 and began talking with the dispatcher as I turned the corner into the living room and saw Gennys open mouthed empty but terrified gaze right in front of my face. Her head had been skewered on a nail that had previously held their wedding picture that now laid on the floor broken frame. Her one arm hung limply by her side, her other arm now detached lay on the floor on the other side of the room looked as though it had been ripped clean off and thrown. The once blue nightgown she had on now was almost completely crimson from the blood that had poured from her empty socket. 

I stepped back consumed by shock and slowly walked outside. John followed after a while.
“Mike? Mike?” John shook me and I awoke from my thoughts realized he had been trying to speak to me. “I said they’re gonna send some guys from Henderson County hopefully should be here shortly.”

I- I’ve never seen anythi-“

“I have.” John interrupted

“What?” I looked John in the eyes.

“Sheriff Dunlap. The town was told it was a gruesome car accident. He was in his car when he ran off the road and hit the tree. But that’s not what killed him. I found his footprints heading back up the hill  before they stopped and then I found him in a tree about 50 feet back into the woods past the wreck. His body was mangled just like this. Bite and claw marks all over his body. 

“Bite and claw marks?” I asked. I hadn’t noticed anything at the time.

“There was bite marks on Gennys arm and her back had been clawed to ribbons.”

“I’m s-sorry I didn’t take a real look before I had to get out.” I stuttered.

“I get it Mike.” He said trying to keep me from going back into complete shock. “Anyways I tracked the beast that got Dunlap as best I could but I lost the trail about a mile from the wreck. The paw prints were huge. Bigger than any print I had ever seen. Just like these.” He pulled me back into the house and pointed at the floor. 

There was a few huge cat paw print about 12 inches around. Following the prints out the door I saw one print in the mud a distinctive “X” scar right in the middle of the pad. 

“What is that?” I asked.

“The Panther”

“Like a black panther that everyone has grown up hearing wives tales about?”

“Sort of. But this one is real and it’s not just some black mountain lion that people say they’ve seen. This one is older than even those myths. It’s the same monster that hunted the early Indians.”


“So it’s thousands of years old?” I asked sarcastically trying to make myself feel a little better about the scene I’d just witnessed

“I-I don’t know all I know is it’s old a lot older than is natural or even possible. When we get done here there’s something I should show you.”

Some Deputies from Henderson county came over and did the entire report for us knowing we weren’t equipped for an investigation like this. One of the Deputies told us if we need help hunting this beast down he could come out on when he’s off if we get any idea on where it lives. EMS took the bodies into custody and brought them back to Henderson county where the nearest hospital is. We thanked them all and left. 

On our way back down off the mountain I remembered the abandoned car at the bottom. 
“You think whoever’s car that is-is okay?” I stuttered picturing another scene like the one I had just witnessed.

“I don’t know we can take a look around”


We stopped past the car and John ran the tag as I got out and looked around. Nothing out of the ordinary. Really did just looked like he ran out of gas and presumably got a ride into town. I got back in the car.
“His names Christopher Murphy address listed out of South Carolina. You find anything?” John said.

“Nothing”

“Alright well let’s go.” John said turning back onto the road out of town. It was our policy to let a car sit for a week before we towed it as we had with many other cars along this road.

“Where are we going?”

“Something I found hunting that thing.”

“Is this where Dunlap died?”

“It’s close”

He pulled the car over about 5 miles down the road and got out grabbing the rifle from its locker. I got out of the car and followed him. We hiked in silence for about 30 minutes before coming up to the mouth of a shallow cave. John pulled his flashlight and lit up the interior. We walked in to the cave and John put the beam of his flashlight on the wall.

“Look familiar?” He asked 

An ancient painting of a paw I the middle of the pad was a very distinct “X” along with a picture of a black cat beside the print was a circle of stick figures around a fire maybe dancing or doing some other ritual. I nodded in acknowledgment.

“I saw the same print in the mud when I found Dunlap. I had hoped it was just a strange coincidence at the time but now I know it’s the same beast. I brought you up here to prove it to you and to convince myself. I hoped I’d find something I missed the first time.” 

“I don’t see anything else here.” I said.

“No but it did give me an idea. We can go to the reservation and see if they have any idea what this is.”

We hiked back down to the jeep. My head filled with the thought of some mythical beast hunting in our backyard.

“We have about 4 hours of daylight left and the reservation is 3 hours away. It may be a late night. I can drop you off at the station if you want but I’m going with or without you.” 

“I’ve never been out that way and I got nothing more important than this to do. Let’s go.”


Chapter two


“We’re here” John woke me up. I hadn’t realized how tired I was when we got in the car and I must’ve passed out immediately.

We went to the Tribal Police Department told them our story and although they did not seem to believe that it was some mythical beast they did give us a name and address for someone who might help. We thanked them and headed to the address and knocked on the door after a few moments an older man opened the door.

 
“Can I help you?” The old man angrily croaked. It was quite late I realized.

“Are you Mr. Gawonii?” John asked.

“Yes, is there a problem?” 

John held up his phone with the pictures of the painting in the cave along with the footprints from the scene.
“Do you recognize these?”

The old man stared at the pictures his eyes showing some recognition. 

“Come in and sit.” He opened the door and we sat at his table.

“He has come back.” Gawonii said solemnly.

“These are the third killing that I have found in two years.”



“If there have only been three that you have found then you haven’t been looking hard enough.” 

Hearing this my heart sunk. I thought of the bodies of the Johnson’s and then I thought of all the abandoned cars we had towed since I started. Were they all dead and we never searched for them. Why were we never told, did no one ever look for them? Were there locals that were mutilated in their homes like the Johnson’s were? Who had I not seen in town recently?


“We call it Anisahoni. It has been here even before my people claimed this land it was a mountain lion cursed by the Gods for reasons unknown turning it black as the night and giving it eyes of fire. It was a vicious monster that brought my people almost to extinction until the tribes Ayunini created a ritual to fend off the beast. But it had costs. The people of the land could not grow old. The Anisahoni would feed on their spirit instead of their flesh.”

“Has the ritual worn off? Why would attacks start again?” I asked.

“It is possible. It would not be the first time. The Anisahoni had attacked my tribe not long before we had been moved to this reaervation. It was believed that my great grandfather had finally killed the Anisahoni and done what others before him had failed to do. He severed Anisahonis head and the tribes Ayunini placed the head in the ground near where your settlers built the town.”

“Cats head.” I blurted out barely loud enough to hear. I recieved a glare from John. I apologized and looked down into my hands.

“They burned the rest of the body in one final ritual. With time my people began to grow older again and it had seemed like the Anisahoni was gone for good. But I suppose when the government moved my people they moved it off the Anishoni’s hunting ground. That’s why we recieved our old age back.”

“So how could it come back?” John asked confused.

“Do your people live long?” Gawonii asked.

“I mean I don’t think I’ve heard of anyone in our town living much past 70 so I suppose not.” John said.

“Perhaps the Anisahoni has been feeding on your peoples spirit since mine were sent to this reservation.”

“So what can we do?” I asked.

“We can try to kill it again. There was belief that it had worked the first time. Perhaps we can find a way to finally put the Anisahoni to death for good.” The old man said. “I will speak with the other elders and I will call you as soon as possible.” 

“Thank you so much for your help Sir.” John said as we got up and left the house. 
“You drive I need to sleep” John said tossing me the keys and getting into the jeep. The sun had set long ago. I drove home with much on my mind. My whole view on my life had changed in just a few hours. And fucking Genny Johnson’s face was burned into my brain.

I pulled into the station and went inside. I was exhausted. I went into our single empty cell and collapsed onto the bunk. John apparently also decided that he wouldn’t bother going home tonight either. He sat in his chair propped his feet on his desk and passed out. I noticed the light flashing on the answering machine as my eyes closed themselves and I drifted off to sleep.

Chapter Three 


“Get up Mike” John said sternly as he was scribbling on a map of the county. 

“What are you doing?” I asked rubbing the sleep from my eyes and grabbing a cup of the shitty coffee John had made. 

John said nothing and hit the answering machine.
“You have 3 new messages”
“September 29th 2014 at 09:44 PM Hey Sheriff it’s Don King, I heard some shit going on up at Roger’s house sounded like some woman screaming bloody murder I don’t know it just seemed like something you should check out. Beeeep”

“September 29th 2014 at 09:57 PM Hey this is Henderson County Dispatch we just got a 911 call that maps to a house on the far side of your county belonging to a Donald King it was a deadline so we attempted callback multiple times bur didn’t get an answer. Beeep”


September 30th 2014 at 0124 AM John it’s Erica I think something happened to Jessica she’s not answering my calls and I heard something down there about 2 hours ago can you check it out in the morning? Thank you. Beeeep”

“Fuck.”

“I already called Henderson county. They’re gonna send some Deputies out to help deal with this. I’m leaving this for them to pick up.” John said not looking up from the map.

“Where are we going first?” I asked still rubbing sleep from my eyes.

“Where do you think?”

Erica was John’s highschool sweetheart who had since fallen out of touch and Jessica was John’s sister. I knew the answer to my question before I asked it but he was taking this a lot calmer than I would have so I wasn’t sure. 

I knew what we were going to find while we were heading up there. John was silent. His white knuckled hands gripping the wheel.

We pulled up to the house John sprung out of the car and didn’t bother doing a callout as he barged into the house. 

I followed after him gun in my hand. 

I found him in the mess that was once a bedroom crouched over the crumpled remains of Jessica Whitaker a woman I had always looked up to she was a big sister to John and I both. She was a Marine and had been able to put up a good fight. As good a fight as you can put up in a cramped bedroom I suppose. There were tuffs of black hair and blood of the panther all over the room. She looked like she was sleeping peacefully. The pool of blood under her said otherwise. A large bite in her side was her only fatal injury. I picked up a bit of the hair. It looked as though it had been slashed off not ripped but there was no knife to be found. I could see the handgun that had been in the bedside table that now lay on its side in the middle of the room. The pistol had slid under the bed. 

“Are you gonna be alright?” I asked. 

“When this thing is dead.” He said standing up. I could see the tears in his eyes. 
“She probably saved a lot of lives. I mean we didn’t get anymore calls after her attack maybe she injured it enough to make it go lick its wounds for the night.”
He turned and walked out of the house quietly. I left him alone and got on the  phone and called in EMS to pick up the body. I went to the car grabbed the camera and took some quick pictures for the later report but I knew we wouldn’t be staying here too long.


When I exited the house all I could hear was the faint crunch of leaves up the mountain. John was already about 100 yards away tracking the blood and turned up leaves from the injured and fleeing panther. Before I could follow I saw a patrol car pulling up the Deputy rolled down the window and called out to me. 

“Hey bud I answered a call for you guys while we were there picking your map. Some guy from Cherokee said he needed you to call him something about a solution or something.” He handed me a scrap of paper with a number written on it.

I thanked him ran after John.

“John! John! Gawonii found a way to kill it.” 

John turned “What do we need?” Seemingly angry that I had inturrupted his hunt or possibly his thoughts.

“I-I don’t know he asked us to call him back” I spat out quickly.

I handed John the paper. He pulled his phone out and dialed the number.

“What do we need to do?. John asked 

“Uh-huh” 

“Okay see you soon”

He put his phone back into his pocket. John picked up a few sticks and made them into an arrow on the trail of the panther and then turned a walked past me back to the car.

I followed quickly and we both got in the jeep and head down the mountain towards town. 

“Whats the plan?” I asked scared to upset the man who was normally stoic but now looked like he could break down at any second.

“Do you have any silver? We need to make some bullets.” 

“I think so.”


Chapter Four 

I pulled the box from under my bed and retrieved a roll of silver quarters that had been given to me as a birthday gift as a child. I ran back outside and hopped into the jeep. John threw it into reverse and flew back down my driveway.
We were on our way back to the station when I asked again how he was holding up. 
John coldly said “I’m fine” 
I know he was lying but it was nice to know he was still with me and hadn’t  completely broken mentally.

We rode in silence the rest of the way to the  station. John got out and immediately went into the garage. I didn’t go in there much, never had much need. It was used as impromptu evidence storage and was full of boxes of reports dating all the way back to the 70’s. John threw some boxes out of the way exposing an old reloading press and beside it a metal kiln. He brought a propane tank over and attached it to the kiln and started it up. I opened the garage door without a word.

We had the bullets made before Gawonii arrived. We had 16 rounds of silver 30.06. I loaded up them up in our old riot control rifles from the 50s. Two surplus M1 Garands that the Sheriff at the time, a former paratrooper had “relieved” from the Army before he got out. I then loaded them into the Jeep.

Gawonii arrived escorted by a tall sturdy man with a knife in his belt named Kanati. Gawonii explained what he had found out to the group.

“The curse laid on the Anisahoni is similar to that set on the Wendigo so we will treat it as such. Silver bullets should kill it and if they don’t we will try fire.”

John called up Henderson  County.
“When your Deputies finish up the investigations over here ask them to spend the night at our station. If they do not hear from us by noon tomorrow they need to evacuate the town I’ll leave my list of all the citizens on my desk. Thank you.”


We all packed whatever gear we thought we might need and got into the Jeep and headed back towards Jessica’s house. 

“I’m sorry about your sister Sheriff.” Gawonii said solemnly. I had told him before we got in the car.

John glanced at me.

“She’s in a better place.” Gawonii continued.

“She’s in a broken pile on the floor in her bedroom” John said through gritted teeth. I could see tears building in his eyes. 

“She no longer belongs to this cursed world. Her spirit is free. She walks with your ancestors now.” 

“We’re here” John said coldly as he pulled into the driveway. 

“Please do not curse yourself because of  what this Demon has done.” Gawonii pleaded.

We got out of the jeep grabbed our rifles and gear and started up the trail passing the “X” John had made earlier. We tracked the long dried blood trail all day. We were deep into the mountain to the west of town when the sun finally set. Turning on our flashlights we continued on at a slower pace. 

By about 0100AM we arrived at the mouth of a deep cave. Inside the cave were large piles of leaves. John went in and kicked over the smallest pile nearly tripping when his foot hit something hard inside. He brushed away the leaves and revealed the half eaten carcass of a deer. I swept the leaves off a larger pile and quickly backed away bringing my rifle up to my shoulder. The face of an open mouthed black bear stared back at me. 

“It’s how big cats keep their kill fresh for longer.” Kanati spoke for the first time since he we left the station.

John swept away the last pile of leaves the feet of a human appearing from it. I helped him remove the leaves from the body. Neither of us recognized his bloated and bloodied face. I checked his pockets and pulled a wallet out. Flipping it open I read out loud “Christopher James Murphy”.

“Guess we gotta tow that car after all” John said making a morbid joke that I was still happy to hear.

We continued on our path into the den of the Panther.

Chapter Five 

Bones littered the floor as we walked deeper into the darkness. Some animal but some human. Some of the skulls looked ancient, yellowed from the pass of time. Others looked fresher still having hair and bits of dried skin left on them.
Had any of these people died doing what we were doing right now? Is there any hope for us? I thought to myself as I stared into the empty sockets of a skull in front of me.

The cave wasnt a smooth walled cavern you see in movies. The walls were jagged where the the mountains had collided into each other millions of years ago. Lots of corners where the beast could be laying in wait for us. 

As hard as we tried to be quiet the crunch of bones breaking beneath our feet echoed through the cave.

As the cave narrowed into a small arch John stopped and pulled his bag from his shoulder. Retrieving a package from inside. Opening the package he pulled out a stick. A road flare? No. Dynamite.

“This is our last resort and our fallback position” he said placing a stick at the base of arch. He carefully placed a few sticks around the area. 
“Gawonii if we fail to kill the Panther I want you to light this and run.” He whispered handing the old man a lighter and putting a fuse inside the last stick and placing it on a rock near Gawonii.

“I hope it doesn’t come to that. But good luck” Gawonii said. As we started through the arch Kanati began muttering something that sounded like it should’ve been a chant. 

The three of us continued on. The air was stale and moist and the stench of death was all around. We were here.

The beams from our flashlight moved around rapidly hoping to get a glimpse of the cat. It wasn’t here. I finally breathed for what felt like the first time since we entered the cave. I could feel my heartbeat in my fingertips as I slowly lowered my rifle.

“What do we-“ 

The blood curdling screech echoed through the cave loud enough to deafen us. Kanati began sprinting back the way we came. I could faintly hear the sounds of a man screaming through the ringing in my ears. John and I followed after Kanati.
Before we had made it back to the archway Kanati was thrown into the roof of the cave somewhere behind us in a quick blur of the panthers paw. 

My flashlight went to the beast. Its black fur seemed to dissolve the light. Its head was bigger than my chest. Ruby red eyes stares through my soul. Most shocking was its face. What little flesh it still had was rotten and barely clinging to its yellowed skull. Just behind the beasts right ear was a K-bar plunged handle deep into its neck. Jessica’s knife.

John had already begun shooting when I came out of my awestruck daze. I began to empty my clip into the black blur that now lunged  at me. I don’t know how many of my rounds hit it before I was thrown towards the wall. As I flew through the air I heard the distinct *ping of an empty M1 Garand. I hit the wall and lost consciousness.

I don’t know how long it had been when I woke up but I could hear a struggle still going on. I crawled to my flashlight that was laying 10 feet in front of me. Picking it up I found my now broken rifle. I turned too quickly, nearly passing out again from the blood rush. As I regained my senses I ran towards the back of the cave passing Kanati whose head had been caved in. 

When my light found them John was on the back of the Panther one arm wrapped around its neck the other K-bar in hand plunging it repeatedly into the Panthers chest. The Panther ran into the walls trying to get the Sheriff off his back.

“Blow the cave! I’ll be right behind you !” John shouted.

I turned and ran back to the arch. The dynamite sat on the rock where John had left it but where was the lighter? I flashed my light around the room trying to find Gawonii. I could still hear John cursing the Panther as I found Gawonii’s body faced down on the floor. I rolled him over and opened his clenched fist pulling the lighter from his grasp. 
“Come on John!” I called as I ran back to the archway. The panthers scream once again echoed through the cave disorienting me. I picked up the dynamite put my light towards the back of the cave and wait a second. 
“Do it!” I heard the Sheriff call out as he came into view in a full sprint. 
I lit the fuse gently placed it on the rock and began running back towards the mouth of the cave tripping after a few feet. My flashlight dropped and lit up behind me. I turned my head to see John making it through the arch. A flash of black consumed him. 

I picked myself back up and ran through the darkness until I could see the light coming through from the rising sun. I felt the quake from the explosion under my feet before the shockwave picked me up and threw me into the woods.

Epilogue

I don’t know whether or not we finally killed the Panther once and for all. My aunt celebrated her 80th birthday last month and we haven’t had any more gruesome deaths in 10 years so I’m hopeful.

When I woke up in the woods that morning the air was filled with the smell of sulfur and burnt flesh. My adrenaline had worn off and I finally felt the holes in my side where the Panther had slapped me into the wall. I hobbled my way back down the mountain to the jeep and drove back to the station catching the Henderson county Deputies before they began evacuating everyone. As we waited for the ambulance they informed me that Don King and Roger Williams and his family were all found deceased the night before. They would go check the cave to see if they could collect the bodies of my team. I  had passed out from blood loss before the ambulance arrived. 

I woke up in the hospital and the doctor told me I had a bad concussion along with a ruptured eardrum, 5 broken ribs along with 5 deep punture wounds on the right side of my chest. 


The day I was released from the hospital was the day of John’s funeral. It was an empty casket funeral as his body was still buried in the mountain. The whole town was packed into our little Baptist church. John’s parents were inconsolable as they watched their second child get buried in a week. I told them their children had saved the lives of everyone in this room. I had hope that it was true and the Panther was truly gone for good. I watched as my friend’s casket was lowered into the ground. I threw the first shovelful of dirt onto the casket before leaving. 


I’m writing this now because I’ve been told it would help deal with the trauma I’ve lived with for all these years. I don’t know if anyone will read it but it has been therapeutic for me. You can believe my story or not I don’t care. If you need to believe or not believe this story isn’t for you anyways. It’s for me and maybe it’s for others who have lived or are living through similar things. Appalachia is an old place and I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s more monsters out there. After all there’s lots of places that have had reported Black Panther sightings. I wouldn’t be surprised if mine isn’t the only one that’s true.

Signed,

Both seemed very nice and we had a great time. The first date was okay. We went to a restaurant and were able to talk a lot - which was pretty good. I didn’t feel a super good connection but I enjoyed the date - and I thought he did too. At least that’s what he said. The day after I heard nothing from him. That was kind of surprising because he was very communicative before the date. I addressed it and he ghosted me. Well, it was okay and I moved on. 
A couple days later I had another date. This one was way better. We went for a coffee and then to a restaurant. It was so easy to talk to each other, we had so much fun and laughed a lot. When he brought me to my car he asked for another date for next week. I happily agreed. He also told me he enjoyed my company a lot, which was nice to hear. But guess what.. the next day he texted but barley - which again, was not how he communicated beforehand. And now I haven’t heard from him in two days. On our date we also talked about communication and how annoying it is that we live in a time where people ghost each other instead of just letting them know that it’s not the right fit. I feel like it has something to do with decency to let a person know. He totally agreed and seemed really reflective. 
Now I feel like I am the problem because it happened twice in a row or I just get the guys who aren’t able to communicate properly. 

I don’t know what I want to archive with this post but maybe someone had the same experience and I am not alone!

He agreed - then the day of he messaged me canceling and we never met up and haven't seen him to this day. He messaged me out of the blue about 3 months after that interaction and told me he was in love with me, and I very sternly told him that he was playing a really crazy push and pull and that though there was no bad blood he needed to move on - fast forward and we are here and he's messaged me a few times out of nowhere over the last 3 days ending in the above message. I have no idea what he's saying in this message, the kid is from the north east so I don't know if it's a lingo thing.

1ifvc5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1ifvc5v/constant_nasal_congestion/,Constant nasal congestion,"I have something going on in my airways that constantly closes it and very easily so. 

I’ve tried a bunch of things. Nothing solves it. This has started many years ago. Many health professionals have looked at it and can’t do anything besides prescribing medicines I’m not willing to take anymore. 

What I know about it is:
* it’s not (all) mucus
* when I get my heart pumping (through exercise for instance) it frees up
* in the morning I feel like the whole nasal area is very much inflamed 
* nasal irrigations with warm saline water helps but very shortly after the issue comes back 
* vitamin C ingestion helps slightly but also for a short period of time
* cold days don’t help 
* warm days help a bit

My theory is that it can’t be all mucus as if I was sick, because when I work out it goes away without ever cleaning my nose. And the airways might be so much closed that a slight change in the environment such as temperature is going to shrink the airways just a tiny bit more and that amount is enough for me to not be able to breathe through the nose. 

If I force it too much, I will eventually be able to free the airways at some point. For a short period of time, that is. But it’s very uncomfortable, I need to be constantly aware of it and it becomes noisy for everyone around me. 

My diet right now consists more of animal based fat and protein and some carbs. Whenever I can avoid it, I do. I drink nothing but water and coffee with cream. Obviously I don’t smoke and I’m not willing to take any pharmaceutical medication. 

So my questions to you guys (and hello! This is my first post here) are: have you experienced something similar? Is there anything I can try to mitigate what feels like persistent nasal inflammation? Is there even a way to tell if that’s what it is?

It started on Friday night. I know that was the eve of Imbolc. So I had a bath using goat's milk foaming bath, as Brigid loved the goats, from what I've read. I also saw that she is worshiped as the Goess of hearth and home. So I filled my bath, and offered my incantation for my home which I use often, but which felt perfect for this occasion in particular. The incantation recognizes that when we empty things, we must refill them with other things to achieve some sort of balance. So the incantation is as follows:

Our home is free of anger
Our home is free of shame
Our home is free of fear
Our home is free of pain

Our home is filled with love
Our home is filled with joy
Our home is filled with magic
Our home is filled with peace.

You will notice that the first stanza rhymes and the second doesn't. There's no real reason for that. It just felt right for me.

So I'd say each stanza. Then pause and take three deep brreaths and observe the bubbles on the exhale. So I'd say the empty stanza, three deep breaths, the full stanza, three deep breaths. I did the series three times. While doing this, I focused on what being a woman means to me specifically. I imagined a fire place where my husband and myself and the cats are. We do not have a fireplace. But I have a vivid imagination. I asked myself what I could do specifically to honour a Goddess of animals and agriculture. I actually adopted a nine month old black kitten just last week. So I feel that taking care of an animal in need would make a Bridgid happy.

I then emptied my bath, visualizing all prior assumptions of what a woman ""should be"" down the plug with the bath water. As I did this, I also turned the tap back on so I could run each of my feet under the running water. I hadn't planned that one. But it felt right in the moment.

I then had an adult discussion about the acts which surround furtility.

The next morning, I drank a coffee which had the intention of peace in my home. We then made butter, as I read that was a traditional thing to do for the Goddess. As I sepparated cream into butter and buttermilk using a stand mixer, I meditated about the women and how hard they had to work to get this treasured substance. I marvelled at the magic that is technology. As a blind person who had never made butter alone, I had no idea what I was doing. So I used a new version of Chat GPT called Gemini. This app takes one picture every second and then describes to me in almost real time what the picture is. So, through the magic of technology, i knew when the fat sepparated from that liquid. We ate that butter on some gluten free corn bread with some bacon and eggs. It was stunning.

I also read to drink a beer. But I've recently discovered I'm gluten intollerant. So instead, I drank a delicious cockttail that is nothing like beer at all.

I actually loved yesterday and this has given me the encouragement to celebrate the wheel of the year. Yay! Thank you, my witches. I love this community. Each and every one of you bring something uniquely magical to this space. The space is blessed that you are part of it. Thank you all for everything over the last two and a half years.

I’d appreciate any thoughts or advice. Firstly while this is a first home machine I’m actually quite experienced at making coffee having worked in cafes for much of my university years, so about 8 years of making coffees 15 hours a week! I’ve used family and friends machines for years and having had that experience I know I want something on the pricier side £1000 ish and upward with dual boiler and PID. I’m Australian but I live in London and I also miss the very particular Australian style coffee (I.e. strong, creamy milk, short). So a good wand is also important.

At the moment I am thinking Lelit Elizabeth or Mara, Rancilio Pro X, or Breville Dual Boiler.

For a grinder I am looking at the Baratza Encore or Eureka Mignon.

I’ll be using it probably to make coffees before work - so it will need to be quick hence dual boiler - and also on work from home days and weekends. My partner is quite handy and would be happy to modify but I’d actually prefer to get a machine that already has a wide range of functions. We are very happy to spend time learning the machine, experimenting and figuring out how to produce the style we like. 

Any tips or advice I’d appreciate it!

1ifv5uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1ifv5uh/looking_to_get_into_amateur_home_roasting_not/,"Looking to get into amateur home roasting, not sure what the differences are between roast levels though, and have a few other questions.","So, I've had very limited experience with coffee. For the most part, I've not liked it, needed a ton of sugar and/or flavored creamer to make it palatable, and I've seen it mostly as a vessel for caffeine and sugar. As such, I never really got super into drinking it, and actually switched to straight up caffeine pills. Granted, my experiences have mostly been with gas station/convenience store/fast food coffee.

I keep hearing about how there's good quality coffee out there, stuff that's sweet enough to not needs its own sugar, not even the faintest trace of bitterness, tastes like God pissing straight dopamine into your mouth. Bought a french press over the pandemic and tried it out, because I needed a hobby. But honestly, the ""coffee snob"" suppliers I've tried from were even worse. Lots of burnt, ashy taste. I've unironically had better coffee from McDonald's. At the time, I did enough researching to learn I probably got some bad batches of pre ground coffee, let it brew for too long, and/or I just don't like dark coffee (which apparently I bought?).

Didn't care enough to keep looking into it, and the glass jar to my french press got broken in my last move, so I haven't really touched the stuff since. But, in the interest of bettering my mental health, I've been trying to wake up an hour, hour and a half earlier than I need to every day, and just sit and enjoy myself for a bit before getting ready for work. So I decided to pick this up again for a morning hobby, and see if I can find a coffee out there that I actually like.

I've done ***some*** preliminary reading, and decided roasting my own beans is probably the best way to control the end product I'm getting. I'm assuming I'm looking to go more towards a light/blonde, or medium roast, based on my prior experiences with searching for ""better"" coffee. I can say, right off the bat, the main thing I don't like about ""common"" coffee is the bitterness, and earthiness. It just tastes like charcoal and dirt, and as I mentioned, sometimes very ashy. Not a fan. I do like lattes and cappucinos, like french vanilla, and there's a few ""uppity"" cafes near me that serve those and I know they roast their own beans in house, but I'm not sure what the sugar content would be, etc. Most likely, I'd be making drinks with other stuff in it, like cinnamon, vanilla extract, etc. So does anyone have any bean/roast level recommendations that would fit well into that?

Also not really sure how long to roast the beans for. I've heard something about the beans cracking, kinda like popcorn kernels, from passively absorbing coffee brewer content, but haven't dug enough to know the significance of that. I've heard little home popcorn makers usually work better for roasting, as opposed to trying to do it in a pan, or oven. Other than that, any recommendations on equipment that won't break the bank? French press versus a pour over brew? I'm also really unfamiliar with coffee jargon, so if someone has a link to a website of some sort that does a good job explaining what the different terminology means, that'd help. I'm in the US, if that matters for ""bean availability"".",2,1738495016.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

Next they’ll sell you a bridge in Brooklyn and call it charity. But here’s the thing—I’m not saying they’re wrong. I’m just saying nobody bothers to tell you how to do it without feeling like a goddamn phony.

If you want to know the truth, most people’s smiles are about as real as the plastic fruit they stick in hotel lobbies. Nice to look at, maybe, but you wouldn’t want to bite into one. They’ll flash you a grin that could light up Times Square, but their eyes are still reading the fine print on their own private misery. I don’t know. Maybe they teach that in charm school, right after how to balance a checkbook and before how to laugh at your boss’s jokes.

But here’s the kicker—the real ones, the smiles that actually mean something, they don’t come from some instruction manual. They’re more like… I don’t know, wildflowers. You don’t plant ’em. You just notice ’em one day when you’re not too busy wishing you were somewhere else. Like when some kid on the subway starts giggling at his own shoelaces, or when the sun hits the fire escape just right, and for a second, the whole racket of life feels a little less rigged.

People’ll tell you to “practice gratitude” like it’s a vitamin. Take two and smile in the morning. But gratitude’s not something you *do*. It’s something that happens to you when you stop comparing your life to everyone else’s highlight reel. It’s the way your kid brother slurps his soup when he thinks no one’s watching, or the way the old lady at the bodega remembers you take your coffee black. You don’t force it. You just stop running away from it.

And breathing? Don’t get me started. They’ll sell you apps and workshops and six-week courses on how to inhale like a human being. But here’s a free tip: Next time you’re stuck in traffic or some meeting that’s deader than Hemingway, just pretend you’re blowing out a birthday candle. The kind you only get one shot at. Do it slow, like you’re savoring the wish. Hell, maybe even make a wish. Who cares if it’s stupid? Stupid’s underrated.

You want to know the secret? Fine, I’ll spill it. The only way to smile without wanting to sock yourself in the jaw is to stop trying so goddamn hard. Let yourself hate things sometimes. Let yourself be a miserable bastard on a Tuesday afternoon. Because the funny thing is, once you quit forcing it—once you stop pretending you’re the director of some Broadway musical called *Your Perfect Life*—the real stuff sneaks in.

I knew this girl once—Esther, her name was. She used to collect subway tickets. Had a whole shoebox of ’em under her bed. One day, I asked her why. She just shrugged and said, *“They’re proof I showed up.”* I didn’t get it then. But now? Maybe smiling’s like that. Not proof you’re happy. Proof you showed up anyway.

Anyway, that’s all I’ve got. If you’re still here, do me a favor: Go look at something useless. A cloud, a crack in the sidewalk, the way your coffee cup leaves a ring on the table like a tiny eclipse. Don’t smile. Don’t even try. Just let your face do what it wants.

This would have been the mid/late 80s in the suburbs of Dublin. My options were limited to say the least - both in terms of budget and availability! 
The local pharmacy was my first haunt and where I would spray the different colour Charlies. I loved Charlie White. (I loved the packaging of and ads for Anais Anais and wanted to like it so much, it seemed sophisticated, but it didn’t work for me.)

Once a week I’d get the bus into town and go to The Body Shop. I would proceed to sample every single tester, including some that would make me feel sick. This is when I feel in love with White Musk - not an original choice I know!-  and it became the first perfume I would wear on a daily basis, to school for comfort.

In my mid teens, my friend and I progressed to the department store. She would dowse herself in Poison, which I liked, but we decided that was hers and mine was Lou Lou! It seems hard to believe it now, as Lou Lou is so affordable, but this was considered such a good fragrance at one point that it spawned a load of (bad) dupes. 

When I eventually got a bottle of the real thing, I very much felt I had arrived. For me it was the perfume of first discos and kisses. It made me feel excited. The first day I sprayed it, I sat in a coffee shop in the middle of the shopping centre just sniffing it on my wrists and (fingerless) gloves. I was quite overcome and I’ve been chasing that feeling since. (And, happily, have found it a few times too!)",5,1738494691.0,FemFragLab,1,1.0,False

1ifv1dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ifv1dm/undiagnosed_neck_problems_for_almost_2_years/,Undiagnosed neck problems for almost 2 years,"Hi everyone!

My name is Zack, and I am 28 years old male.

I wanna share my neck problems that I have been having for almost 2 years since the 26th of March, 2023 until the date with the hopes of someone leading me to the right path to treat/cure it.

About me:

1. I work as a Product Manager in a tech startup and have been a daily PC user of at least 6 hours a day since I can remember.
2. I workout at least 1 time a week with heavy weights and have been doing so for the past 6 years but never over lifted or tried hard.
3. I walk an average of 6K steps per day.
4. I smoke Hookah on social events \[1-3 times a month\].
5. I don't drink nor do any other activity in my life.
6. I drink lots of coffee.

Background before the situation:

I did a rihnoplastic surgery for my nose in January \[3 months before the neck issue\] where we changed the form of the nose and removed sinuses from my nose and forehead.

I kept taking nasal spray Azelatsin for 3 months after the surgery.

I have never had neck pain in my life, and if did, then it did not last for more than hours because I don't remember it.

On March 2023, I woke up and started working \[remote day\] and during work, I started getting neck pain on my right side of the neck, I used flight pillow to hold my neck as I didn't have the massage gel nor a collar since I never needed them. This pain kept increasing day by day until it became almost 4 days where on day 4, the pain became like electric shock behind both of my eyes on both sides that was very painful and itchy and hot.

Went to doctor , did an x-ray and got diagnosed with osteochondroses and she gave me celecoxib and some neck relaxants. I took it and in 2 days I got better.

And then after day 5 of the treatment it came back, now it started going down to the neck and mostly on my left side where I feel that the muscle is stuck/can't breath or flexed and I have to hold it to feel slightly better. And the pain sometimes goes to the right side, never on the two sides together but it keeps jumping sides although mostly left side.

Went back to the doctor, and she requested an MRI, we did it and found x2 (**Bulging Disc),** one on the left and the other on the right but both had very small bulges \[according to the doctor\]. She gave me this time more relaxants and Meloxicam. And also assigned me to an Osteopathic \[10x sessions\].

This time, it didn't help at all. The pain kept coming mostly when I sit in front of the computer even though I am using an office chair that is comfortable and aligned with the Monitor that is elevated above my head.

Went back to the doctor and she was very confused, gave me different types of anti inflammatory along with Ettifoxine. And still nothing.

I went to Otorhinolaryngologist incase my surgery is triggering this as referral pain, he found out that my nose is not correct and some pipes are closed \[not entirely\] because of the new form which was incorrect \[ not straight\]. He gave me sprays and Montelukast.

I somehow started getting relieved, not sure whether it's the first doc's pills or the 2nd as I was taking both together.

Once the cycle finished, pain started coming back especially when I talk for long periods, drive, or sit in front of the compute for more than 10 minutes.

I went to new doctor and he gave me Lyrica, no results.

Went to another doctor, and he gave me amitriptline, started with 10mg per day and we kept going until we got 50g per day, 1 pill before sleeping and another during the day. I can't say that I got better but the change was not very noticeable.

Note: All those period, I am wearing a collar for like 3-4 hours a day if not more.

Finally, I went to a new doctor who is an osteopathic at the same time, he somehow managed to relief my pain by removing the knots in my neck. But they kept coming back after 5-7 days.

Then we decided to inject botox after testing with Lidocaine injection.

Pain was significantly decreased but didn't disappear.

It started becoming more of a discomfort.

Now the ways the pain appears is mostly on my left side of the neck/head.

Starts either behind my ear or behind my eye with an itchy feeling that is painful to touch, and if I don't take deep breath it radiates to my shoulder, never to my hand. Maximum radiation was to my biceps/tricpes.

  
Also whenever I get pain related discomfort/pain which is almost everyday, I also feel at the same time that my nose is clogged and heavy. 

My ways to managing the pain:

1. I stopped using monitor and started using laptops screen \[when my head looks down, I get less pain/discomfort than when I look up or straight\].
2. When the discomfort appears, I would wash my face, massage my nose and take deep breaths.
3. I stopped doing home flexibility exercises as they tend to radiate the pain and never assist.
4. I would clean my nose and ensure that air is going inside.

Note: In the period that my problem started, I noticed a decrease in the body oxygen on my Samsung watch where it went to levels that I never had before. I don't remember the percentage but it was somewhere close to 80%.

My question now, is what is this?

Why no one of the 20x doctors that specialise in nose issues and nerve issues managed to properly diagnose my pain?

Is there any doctor that you recommend me to visit or maybe one of you could kindly help me by putting me on the right path of the treatment.

We all know caffeine is bad for PET, coffee or tea and make symptoms of autophony much worse.

So, I wanted to share something that has been working for me, and that is Korean Ginseng tea. I have a cup of that in the morning, with... and here's the second thing, an electrolyte tablet.

Now, a bit about why I do this. Basically, the Korean Ginseng is a replacement for coffee. It has no 'diuretic' effects which are a strong part of why the latter is bad. You can be focused and energised but, without the consequences as much.

On the electrolyte, it helps hydration.

This is all anti dehydration basically, which is against what makes PET symptoms worse. It's not an end all, just a helper.

I only take vitamin D and creatine as supplements. I live a very active lifestyle, I am a powerlifter and I eat a pescetarian diet. I dont smoke anymore (quit because of this issue, but was never a heavy smoker). 

I have been dealing with stomach pains for over 2 months. My doctor has had me taking pantoprazole 40 mg and I have also been tested for H. Pylori, but it was negative. The pain feels like burning or gnawing. Sometimes I get very bloated or feel neausa. 

The pain is between my ribcage and my belly bottom, but sometimes its the whole stomach. I have acid reflux often and my stool is watery and acidic when its at its worst. Sometimes the pain is there all the time and other times its only after I eat. 

After a while of avoiding acidic foods, juice, coffee and carbonated drinks and taking pantoprazole, the pains mostly went away and only came back sometimes. I almost felt like I was back to normal. But as I quit taking the pills and starting eating stuff like tomatoes and drinking coffee again, it all came back and now I feel like I am back to square one. But I have been very very careful with my diet, I watch everything I eat to avoid triggers and it seems like even a small slipup will ruin all my progress and give me lots of pain. 

I have kept a food diary, but all it shows it that acidic and spicy foods trigger pain and my pains started off being 8/10, got down to 3/10 when I was feeling my best and now its at a 7/10 again. 

I have never dealt with any stomach issues in the past.

No amount of cardio will fix excessive calories, processed junk, or constant overeating. 

If fat loss is the goal, the gym helps, but the kitchen wins.

Practical Steps:

	1.	Fix Your Diet First: Training is important, but if you’re eating in a surplus, fat loss won’t happen.

	2.	Stop Drinking Your Calories: Sodas, fancy coffee drinks, and juices add up fast—swap for water or black coffee.

	3.	Focus on Whole Foods: Lean proteins, veggies, healthy fats, and fiber keep you full and fuel fat loss.

	4.	Be Mindful of Portion Sizes: Even “healthy” foods can cause weight gain if you’re eating too much.

	5.	Use Exercise to Enhance, Not Compensate: Train for strength, health, and endurance—not just to “burn off” bad eating choices.",1,1738493379.0,u_Defiant_Radish_9095,0,1.0,False

1ifuomd,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1ifuomd/my_personal_cheatcode_towards_quitting_nicotine/,My personal cheatcode towards quitting nicotine.,"It is extremely late and I do not want to edit nor revise this, but I have experienced my fair share of addiction in correlation to vaping. the nicotine helped me lose weight and it started to become serious with body image and modeling, it also was an additive introduced in a fast drug spiral during my undergrad. it was amazing, a good hit after the meal, a good additive in the morning, a good chaser for alcohol, nice flavors, a good chaser for bud, but it concerned me. note: i noticed everyone who was addicted around me to have their own little habits with their vaping nicotine pacifier, these are just mine. flower also helped with working out, but unfortunately i plateaued as there's only so much leanness you can achieve without a lack of cardio. either way i dont want to yap, i just want to provide a background for all of this.

i was vaping for around 3 years, got heavily into it my last 1 and a half. same thing w weed, did it a lot during my undergrad, masters student rn thats determined to tone it down for the sake of actually having a working brain. quit once for 4 weeks, fell back into it because something mentally traumatizing happened with a relationship, huge change, mentally fell back into it. 

**HERE IS THE ACTUAL GUIDE START TO FINISH (if i were to go through it for a fourth time)**

  
alright, so the start. ive quit about 3-4 times, some have been a breeze, some have been ass. make sure ur making time for this, understand that if u fold then ur going to need to find another perfect amount of time to quit if ur busy.

wednesday 4 pm, toss it out, get a good workout in, sweat. make sure you wear a hoodie even at the gym, focus on getting that natural high and that runners high if youre into that (vaping and running has never floated my boat but u do u). mentally prepare yourself and note down youre going to be talking against yourself by tonight, dont fall for it. just kinda zone out and fuck around, smoke a shit ton of weed and watch your favorite childhood tv show, or spongebob, or nerd out on some space shit. videogames also help, but personally, i used to vape after like every round of a shooter. just keep it down and make it to the next day.

sleep in next day, aim for like 2-3, get in a mf weed coma. ur gonna feel like ass and if youre REALLY struggling. cold wash, plunge, shower should do the trick. i recommend drinking mullein tea as it helps get that nasty gunk out at times, and also its a ncie little energy boost. try to get some outside time, get some sun, focus on eating some good meals. if you liked some blue razz ice, go get some blue jolly ranchers to suck on or some actual fruit. get creative, this is the biggest thing for this. once u get creative with cooking or finding an alternative, ur already spending time zoning out (of vaping) and branching urself into life again. thug it out, you can do it. fall asleep fast tonight, feel free to use any amount of flower, i personally did that so i will never judge someone. make sure your tolerance is kinda low if you do use za throughout the quitting process so you can fully reap the rewards and grant you some ""bonus"" time lol. 

  
alright, next day, goal is to get to 72 hours. nicotine is completely out of your body till then so you need to be SWEATING out and peeing out liquids. constant lemon water and sugar helps to cut cravings down. also, try not to binge too much on sugar, but i really do get it bro. its seriously all good if u need to splurge, no judgement here, we're all human. BUT, i do care about you so im going to lay down this piece of information. the sugar is going to hit in 20, eating something really sweet and kinda letting it rde out is ur best bet for not feeling like ass and going all in. give it some time, let it wait, control ur mind to how u feel and understand that you got a lot of fucking power over this. also an excuse to maybe cheat the diet a tad, either way, a tray of cinnamon rolls over a miami mint is going to be better in the long run. get high, do shrooms for all i gaf about (around 5 if yall do take this srsly) and pass the hell out, or smoke, or just run 6 miles and do 500 pushups to get some good sleep. or melatonin and chamomile tea, or beat yo meat 4 times. whatever it is PASS OUT AND GET UR FUCKING SLEEP, i guarantee it is so possible to get rest without nicotine, yes cravings can be ass but ur body has no choice but to recharge if u keep stressing it out \*naturally and with the usage of drgs haha flying cars they said\*  
its the next day, saturday i think, you should be around the 50ish mark once u wake up, this is going to be the wonkiest day, i swear, ur going to have the weirdest and most terrible cravings because its the last remnants of the drug draining out of ur system. understand that this feeling is a GOOD thing and it must be done in order to balance out how much quick dopamine youve put in ur body and if u rly think about it, all those hits for 3-4 days of suffering. NOT A BAD PRICE TO PAY IM NOT GONNA LIE, god couldve made it harder and done our asses with a year of addiction, this is a doable thing. the government is so quick to ban actual flower, but chuck down vapes and absolute boof thc carts/dispos in illegal states. these chemicals and random compounds are being injected into these plastic devices to prey at the vulnerable portions of ur brain, its to keep the money flow going for the government, hospital bills and lung cancer, yum. a medical officers greatest wet dream. understand that this is not your fault, this is something you hooked onto because you didnt understand how deep it could get. this nootropic is going to play games on you and you WILL have that voice that will tell you that its not that bad and one hit wont change anything but GET through it. i promise you, you will be so glad you did it. the chest pains,headaches, its all going to go away and you can aim towards mental clarity in WEEKS. it doesnt have to be your identity. a vice? maybe, but right now a vice isnt what ur looking for so let it go. also if u stuffed pints of ice cream and hold out this long just to fold. congrats, u got some weight to shed off and ur back on the (not)dreaded california cherry. weed is ur best friendand make sure ur eating a lot and working out, workout w multiple layers. 

wake up tomorrow, do something spontaneous. go on a hike, do some work at a coffee shop. avoid triggers. avoid walking past the usual spots. good shit, its out of your system. now its just ur dopamine receptors itching for a shmack. be spontaneous. keep it fun. wake and bake (woooo). incorporate a routine of doing new things that you werent doing outside of vaping, being in newer and different areas can help so much. some of yall might think being outside and distracting yourself is also key, but my first quit involved me finishing my hw early, starting my quit, smoking nonstop and playing videogames for the next 3-4 days. shit worked, my most recent quit 2 months ago, i was in the gym constantly doing cardio and improving what i could. alright, heading to bed, cant believe i typed all of this lol. i never thought id ever use reddit to post somethimg, im also extremely toasted and want to get my mind off something, but i kinda wanted to see if i could potentially help someone so here it is. i dont really know how to work this app and i dont know if anyone is going to see this, but if you do good luck! rooting for u.",9,1738493036.0,QuitVaping,2,0.91,False

I am trying to write a historical fiction (no paranormal, no aliens) about settling a culture. About 4,000 BC is when a young couple forced out by their tribe, eventually come to a small patch of fertile land and manage to fight off bands of other claimants and wild animals to set up a small community with a few friendly wanderers they've met. The woman, though physically weaker than the men, uses her foresight and intelligence to fight off invaders and establish her man's rule. This part ends with the woman standing beside her man sitting on a rough hewn stone seat as a symbol of his kingship. 

It's four chapters with 9-10 scenes of 1500 words each and is told through a third-person omniscient POV. 

Then 2,000 years later, her direct descendant is kneeling by the now dilapidated stone seat in a once opulent but neglected castle around her. Her head is bowed almost in defeat. There is fighting outside the castle and her forces seem near exhausted. 

This part I am writing in a first person POV. 

I need to briefly account for the intervening 2,000 years. A passage of time from her ancestor to this woman like in old westerns where there screen flashes speeded up images of sun going across the sky, a clock spinning fast or wind sweeping across sand dunes. Her kingdom rose and fell several times during this but her line survived. The stone seat is the only surviving icon connecting the two women. 

What would be a good way to link these two timelines and in what POV? 

I've tried several ideas but I'm blocked. If I can't do it over the weekend, I'll have to wait till Friday night to pick it up again.",1,1738493031.0,writers,12,1.0,False

So here it is! Original idea was to use coffee table and bean bag for my ""cockpit"", but unexpectedly (or very expectedly) 2 items needed to be added: ottoman for pedals not to slide, and heavy box for table not to jump

Nevertheless now it feels pretty comfortable and I'm happy with setup. An alternative was to buy cheapest Playseat, but I decided to see whether this hobby is going to be long-term one

Ah, and speaking about wheel impression - first try was total confusion instead of delight 😀 I didn't understand force feedback, and doubt whether it really should work this way. I faced difficulties I never had on controller and generally speaking my very modest skills had been reset. So next followed 1.5 weeks of demotivation and inactivity

George was always really nice and a good friend to my dad, but over the years I started to feel uncomfortable.

When I was twelve, I was sitting on my couch and George sat on top of my leg. I figured he didn't know I was there and I felt really awkward so I didn't say anything until about ten or fifteen seconds later when he said ""oh, sorry!"" And got up. I tried not to think about it as a big deal but it's always stuck with me whenever I think about this.

I don't remember many other things specifically from when I was young, but I do remember telling my mom that I felt uncomfortable around George and she told me he probably takes a liking to me because he doesn't have a daughter. I trust my mom implicitly, and now she would call herself a feminist, but I do have to take into account that at this point in time we were living in a male dominated Southern Baptist environment where it's possible her ideas were skewed.

When my family moved out of the country, my dad called George while I was in the back of the car. I reluctantly said hi but he seemed really excited to see me. I can't remember anything specific that he said but I remember being really apprehensive.

A year or so later, my family went back to the US for a family member's funeral. It was a really stressful time for me, and at one point my dad took my brother and me out for coffee. At least, that's what he said he was going to do. But when we got to the coffee shop, I found out it was a surprise meet up with George. I had never told my dad my worries about George because I was afraid of being shut down or of being wrong and accusing someone who didn't do anything, so I don't fault him for this at all. My brother had no idea either, and was just excited to see someone who had been his mentor as a kid. George saw me and said, almost flustered and awestruck, ""Oh my gosh! You're growing into a young woman!"" We all hugged him (possibly before he said this) and it felt very uncomfortable. I spent the rest of that time coming up with excuses to not be around them, which was terrifying because I was feeling really unsafe in America after living in a really safe country. My dad picked up on the tension and was definitely confused, but I never ended up explaining it to him and just started crying in the car later.

Later that day, I went out with my best friend and her brother, and told them all my thoughts. I did my best to provide an objective viewpoint, but the more I talked the more disgusted my friend seemed. She said, ""Nope. He's a creep."" I brought this up with my mom when we were out of the country again and she was understanding of it but also careful not to make any quick judgements.

I'm coming to Reddit because no one I have told about this can speak objectively, and I really don't know how to read this situation. I've had pretty terrible anxiety since I was a little kid, and I've always been terrified of being s*xually ab*sed, so it's entirely possible that I'm reading into a situation that's not a big deal. But, given the type of men that America props up, I don't think it would be a surprise if I was right either.

(Please don't mind the grammar errors, English isn't my first language)

I (F18) have just started university in September and I met some really great friends very early on, we have a nice group of 8 people and we got pretty close pretty quick. A few weeks ago, we had a little party/gathering for a ""second"" New Year's, as not all of us were in town on the 31st, we played typical party games like truth or dare and never have I ever. During these games, we learned that three of our friends had a crush on someone inside the friend group. Of course we all were curious as to who were the crushes but they wouldn't tell us for obvious reasons. After the party, I tried to get my friends to tell me who their crushes were, and I felt like one of them, Anna, would fold, so I kept asking for clues, and ended up getting some : it was a girl and it wasn't Beth nor Lea; so from there on, I had few options left : Alex, Ellie, Erica and myself.

Last Monday, I asked her once again if she was sure she didn't want to tell me and she finally said yes, so we went to get coffee so she would tell me. She asked me who I thought it was and I said Ellie, because it made sense to me, but she said it wasn't her, the thing is, she's not that close to Alex and Erica, so my second guess was me, as we are pretty close, and it was. I was kinda shocked cause I didn't really think it would be me, so at first I didn't say anything. She told me she knew it was never gonna happen and she was ok but wanted to tell so that she could move on. I then asked her a few questions, like since when (she told me it was since September), and she proceeded to tease me about how blind I'd been about it, since it was, according to her, pretty obvious that she liked me. Like how we were always sitting next to each other, how she would always accompany me to fill my water bottle for no apparent reason, and lots of tiny stuff like that. Now, I didn't realize she was doing any of this because I thought I was the one who always made sure to sit next to her and all. I told her that and all the things *she* hadn't noticed. So, there we were, pretty much admitting that we both liked each other, but that's it, we didn't talk about if we would get together or anything. I did tell her that I was scared I wanted to be in a relationship more than I wanted to be with her.

Anyways, a week passed and I have been the most stressed I've ever been, I didn't sleep well nor enough, and I've been thinking about the whole thing every damn second. On Friday, we went to the cinema and then we ate together and walked for about an hour and a half. It wasn't really a date, at least not from my POV, but it also wasn't 100% not a date. We held hands for pretty much the whole walk, and when I grabbed her hand (or she grabbed mine, im not actually sure who initiated it) my heart literally skipped a beat, but in the stress way, like it was actually painful. During the walk it was really nice to hold her hand though. When we arrived in front of her building, she asked if I wanted to come up, I said no, we hugged, and I went back to mine. This whole part from the moment we arrived till the moment I left, I felt horrible, like physically aching from stress and idk what else. I almost had to sit down on my way back.

A few days ago, I was pretty sure I wanted to give this a try, then the whole day Friday, I was pretty sure I would end it, and then after Friday night I wasn't sure again. Right now im pretty sure im going to end it. The thing is, how do I after pretty much taking her on a date and stringing her along for a week ?? I feel like such an asshole for not stopping it from the beginning but instead getting her hopes up. I think that from her POV, Friday night was a great date and that we are going to be something. And I mean, it was a great night, but at two points during it, I was physically aching.

I just don't think I can deal with the stress, the aching, the pressure, and the fact that we are part of the same friend group. I feel like if I don't end it soon this whole thing will kill me. 

So I guess what im asking is, how do I end it without hurting her and losing my friend ? How do I apologize for being such an asshole and stringing her along ?",1,1738492500.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I (39F) and my partner (40M) have been together for 4 years. when we met it was an instant connection, and from day 1 we became a couple. Now, to provide some context, I got divorced 6 years ago it was an extremely abusive marriage last had lasted 13 years, and have 3 sons. i took 2 years to heal and find myself before i considered entering into dating (I actually didn't set up my tinder profile, a friend did while we were sitting through a long surgery, it became really funny going through profiles, some were absolutely hilarious, the pictures, omg, haha). Either way, this is how I met \*Carl (not real name).

Carl is a software developer (he's brilliant, an insanely skilled and talented dev). we had been together for a few months when my circumstances changed drastically, Carl offered to let me move in with him, I was apprehensive and excited at the same time. Thing is he stayed in a different city, not far only 45 mins, but it's a 180 degree difference. I went about repainting (his house was literally empty, he slept, ate, existed in his office, bed in there everything so the house had not been maintained at all. When I moved in I started fixing things, repairing, repainting, etc which he really liked and it felt like a home. the commute to my kids (joint custody) when it was my time with them was heavy, they didn't like it there for obvious reasons, no friends around, different house, totally different vibe of this city.

I won't lie, it was an incredibly difficult adjustment. I uprooted, had no friends around, and my family live in a different part of the country. I had no bearings, the people in this city were not nearly as open-minded and friendly an in this way I felt very isolated. Of the people i did meet, only a small handful were authentic and intellectual and weren't offended by different opinions and views. it was hard, really hard, to top it off, i wasn't working. Carl never showed me around the city, and the people i saw the most were his parents.

So as I was battling to adjust, Carl suddenly had to start travelling for work, but like for 2 months at a time, so i was completely alone (backstory: his boss was an asshole, a true narcissist in every way, not the 'oh he's a narcissist' way, a real one, the red flags were on display, when i brought it up Carl got angry, if i mentioned anything 'negative' about this dude, it was met with serious anger, Carl literally couldn't see that his boss didn't give a f\*\*k about him, but I could). this caused so much tension, even the suggestion of getting his cv out there to feel around was taboo to bring up.

So off he went diligently as instructed. he'd be gone for months, back for a couple months then gone again. his life revolved around his boss. But i loved (and still love!) Carl. i do have to admit it was super hard for me, we fought a lot while he was away, and i realized that when i did cause a fight it was because i was desperate for connection and also what I think was a little jealous that he was having all these experiences and making memories of exciting new places that i could not share with him. I did explain this to him once I had figured it out though. either way, I was committed, I was in this 100%, I love him, i wanted to stand by him. but things got crazier and crazier with his boss, the demands became insane, neon red flags everywhere.

I gave Carl all of me because I knew the person he was, but that changed as his work changed and he started assimilating the toxic attitude of his boss and treating me as though i wasn't a person, but i still tried. i am not going to say i was perfect, no damn way, I am an independent thinker, i have my own view and opinions, there are times where i am definitely at fault, and i will take full responsibility for them.

I eventually found a job again, and it was in my city, the commute was 2 hours there, 2 hours back (traffic) and super expensive. Carl and i agreed we would both move back to my city since he works remotely from anywhere. when we spoke about it i put a timeframe down saying that as soon as my contract becomes permeant the move has to happen, basically in 7 months he agreed. I kept reminding him, but i don't know if he just wasn't paying attention or if he didn't realize it was going to happen.

Things came to a head in August of last year, I came home on a friday and told him i was going to be leaving on sunday back to my city. He broke down, he admitted that he had neglected me and had treated me pretty toxic, begging me not to go. we both cried a lot that weekend because we were both in pain, but it was something i had to do, something he had known about, that i had constantly reminded him about. He took me leaving his house as a sign that I was leaving him, that was not the case! I told him it was not the case, but he still believed it was.

He left again for thailand in October. I was STILL committed to him and i made this clear. In december he was involved in a terrible accident that landed him in ICU for 3 days, and another 9 days in general ward. After this happened ALL i wanted to do was get to him but i couldn't. But we connected during this time more so than we had in the last year, we were communicating healthily expressing our feelings, growing and repairing us, i felt like the guy I had met was finally back, the man I knew was back, it was magical. but very short lived. it was also at this time that his boss revealed his true psycho colours that i had already known he was for years.

Carl was suddenly thrust into chaos, he didn't know what to do, but at the same time he stopped communicating with me. I had no idea what was happening, constantly asking if he was safe and what was going on. Now if there's one thing i know far too well, it's chaos and having your world fliped on it's head. I could absolutely 100% identify with the confusion, the overwhelm and the fear for your life and safety. This is territory i know intimately.

Over the course of January, i was constantly trying to communicate with him, constantly asking what's happening, how he was, what his plan was, asking from any kind of clarity, that i love him and support him. I was telling him to come home, regroup, and go from there. His answers changed from day to day if i even heard from him at all. it got to the point mid-January that i had no idea if we were even together anymore.

The whole of January was hell, I knew nothing, was told different things constantly. I was worried, anxious and so fearful for him, I hated what he was going through because i knew exactly what it feels like. At the same time i was grateful that he had finally seen his boss for who he really is, and even though i knew this would eventually be the case i hated that Carl was in pain.

He told me he was coming home, but that all changed. instead what started happening was him telling me that he actually didn't want to come home, he said his heart was no longer here, that we had been apart for too long, I asked him if he was breaking up with me, he said no. but this didn't align with what he was saying in his messages. I sent him vids every morning and evening telling him i love him, i support him, i will wait for him, but nothing apart from ""thank you"". For the last 12 days I have literally, and i mean literally been begging him to tell me if he sees me in his future or not. his response was that it was more complicated than that, what does that even mean? when you ask someone whether they see you in their life and future it's a simple yes or no. Yesterday I couldn't deal with it anymore, I have cried so much for weeks, I have lived with not knowing what's going on at all. i sent him a text saying it was a simple question to answer, and his silence and things he has said in messages is actually the answer and I'm listening now, after i sent that I blocked him.

my heart is shattered, I was fighting so hard constantly telling him i love him, i support him, i will wait for him, i will fight with him, that i will stand by him through the darkest times, but it's like it didn't matter to him at all. Now i'm sitting here wondering how in one month our relationship went from magic to nothing. I'm wondering if he even cares that it's ended, if he loved me like he claimed, if i even mattered to him?

I kind of wish he could post his side of things and his feelings so i could at least get some understanding of what has happened.

I'm sorry this is so long (even super summarized it's damn long) but AITA for not fighting harder, should i have just given him more time? ",1,1738492302.0,AskMenRelationships,1,1.0,False
1ifui5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1ifui5y/need_suggestions_gifting_a_specialty_coffee/,Need suggestions: Gifting a specialty coffee starter kit to a friend,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning to introduce a friend to specialty coffee. He’s an everyday coffee drinker but has only ever had instant coffee. I want to get him a thoughtful gift that gives him a great first experience with brewed coffee. Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. **Agaro French Press** 
2. **Blue Tokai Sampler Pack (Whole Beans)** – Will suggest he gets it ground at a local outlet as needed, so it stays fresh.
3. **A good ceramic mug** – Either from Amazon or cupsofmagik for an artisanal touch.
4. Will add a gift card if I'm still under 2k

Budget: Around **₹2000**. Would love to hear if this is a solid combo or if you have any recommendations for better alternatives within this budget. Also, any must-know tips for a first-time specialty coffee drinker?

Thanks in advance! ☕✨

When it comes to selling a home, first impressions are crucial, particularly in areas like the kitchen. Home staging decor for the kitchen can significantly enhance the appeal of this essential space, attracting potential buyers and increasing property value. The goal is to create an inviting and functional atmosphere that allows buyers to envision themselves in the home.

One of the most effective strategies for kitchen home staging decor is decluttering. Clear countertops of excess appliances and personal items to showcase the workspace. A minimalistic approach not only emphasizes the kitchen's features but also highlights its potential for functionality.

Another key element is color palette selection. Opt for neutral tones on walls and cabinetry to create a fresh, airy environment. Consider adding vibrant accents, such as colorful dishware or a stylish fruit bowl, to breathe life into the space without overwhelming it.

- **Lighting:** Ensure the kitchen is well-lit. Use natural light to your advantage by opening curtains and blinds. Add stylish light fixtures to enhance aesthetics and functionality.
- **Accessories:** Incorporate decorative but practical items. For instance, a chic cutting board or a small herb garden can add both charm and usability.
- **Furniture:** If space allows, include a small dining table or bar stools to create a cozy eating area. This inclusion can help buyers visualize family gatherings in the kitchen.

Finally, consider a pleasant scent. Before showings, bake cookies or brew coffee to create a warm, inviting atmosphere that makes the kitchen feel like home. Overall, effective home staging decor for the kitchen can transform the space into a welcoming centerpiece, making it easier for potential buyers to fall in love with the home.

As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner to make my days stress-free. Who doesn't want a bit of dopamine in the day? It's easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect.

I am 39, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last couple of years it has been a landslide spiral down in my personal space, so I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes, anything (SFW/NSFW/mix), and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world! Just have an open mind! If you like what I wrote drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship. Just harmless fun!

Looking forward to connecting.",2,1738491893.0,LetsChat,0,1.0,False
1ifuemw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ifuemw/aita_for_ending_a_4_year_relationship_im_a_broken/,"AITA for ending a 4 year relationship, I'm a broken mess.","Grab a coffee, this is a long one, but I'll try summarize as best i can.

I (39F) and my partner (40M) have been together for 4 years. when we met it was an instant connection, and from day 1 we became a couple. Now, to provide some context, I got divorced 6 years ago it was an extremely abusive marriage last had lasted 13 years, and have 3 sons. i took 2 years to heal and find myself before i considered entering into dating (I actually didn't set up my tinder profile, a friend did while we were sitting through a long surgery, it became really funny going through profiles, some were absolutely hilarious, the pictures, omg, haha). Either way, this is how I met \*Carl (not real name).

Carl is a software developer (he's brilliant, an insanely skilled and talented dev). we had been together for a few months when my circumstances changed drastically, Carl offered to let me move in with him, I was apprehensive and excited at the same time. Thing is he stayed in a different city, not far only 45 mins, but it's a 180 degree difference. I went about repainting (his house was literally empty, he slept, ate, existed in his office, bed in there everything so the house had not been maintained at all. When I moved in I started fixing things, repairing, repainting, etc which he really liked and it felt like a home. the commute to my kids (joint custody) when it was my time with them was heavy, they didn't like it there for obvious reasons, no friends around, different house, totally different vibe of this city.

I won't lie, it was an incredibly difficult adjustment. I uprooted, had no friends around, and my family live in a different part of the country. I had no bearings, the people in this city were not nearly as open-minded and friendly an in this way I felt very isolated. Of the people i did meet, only a small handful were authentic and intellectual and weren't offended by different opinions and views. it was hard, really hard, to top it off, i wasn't working. Carl never showed me around the city, and the people i saw the most were his parents.

So as I was battling to adjust, Carl suddenly had to start travelling for work, but like for 2 months at a time, so i was completely alone (backstory: his boss was an asshole, a true narcissist in every way, not the 'oh he's a narcissist' way, a real one, the red flags were on display, when i brought it up Carl got angry, if i mentioned anything 'negative' about this dude, it was met with serious anger, Carl literally couldn't see that his boss didn't give a f\*\*k about him, but I could). this caused so much tension, even the suggestion of getting his cv out there to feel around was taboo to bring up.

So off he went diligently as instructed. he'd be gone for months, back for a couple months then gone again. his life revolved around his boss. But i loved (and still love!) Carl. i do have to admit it was super hard for me, we fought a lot while he was away, and i realized that when i did cause a fight it was because i was desperate for connection and also what I think was a little jealous that he was having all these experiences and making memories of exciting new places that i could not share with him. I did explain this to him once I had figured it out though. either way, I was committed, I was in this 100%, I love him, i wanted to stand by him. but things got crazier and crazier with his boss, the demands became insane, neon red flags everywhere.

I gave Carl all of me because I knew the person he was, but that changed as his work changed and he started assimilating the toxic attitude of his boss and treating me as though i wasn't a person, but i still tried. i am not going to say i was perfect, no damn way, I am an independent thinker, i have my own view and opinions, there are times where i am definitely at fault, and i will take full responsibility for them.

I eventually found a job again, and it was in my city, the commute was 2 hours there, 2 hours back (traffic) and super expensive. Carl and i agreed we would both move back to my city since he works remotely from anywhere. when we spoke about it i put a timeframe down saying that as soon as my contract becomes permeant the move has to happen, basically in 7 months he agreed. I kept reminding him, but i don't know if he just wasn't paying attention or if he didn't realize it was going to happen.

Things came to a head in August of last year, I came home on a friday and told him i was going to be leaving on sunday back to my city. He broke down, he admitted that he had neglected me and had treated me pretty toxic, begging me not to go. we both cried a lot that weekend because we were both in pain, but it was something i had to do, something he had known about, that i had constantly reminded him about. He took me leaving his house as a sign that I was leaving him, that was not the case! I told him it was not the case, but he still believed it was.

He left again for thailand in October. I was STILL committed to him and i made this clear. In december he was involved in a terrible accident that landed him in ICU for 3 days, and another 9 days in general ward. After this happened ALL i wanted to do was get to him but i couldn't. But we connected during this time more so than we had in the last year, we were communicating healthily expressing our feelings, growing and repairing us, i felt like the guy I had met was finally back, the man I knew was back, it was magical. but very short lived. it was also at this time that his boss revealed his true psycho colours that i had already known he was for years.

Carl was suddenly thrust into chaos, he didn't know what to do, but at the same time he stopped communicating with me. I had no idea what was happening, constantly asking if he was safe and what was going on. Now if there's one thing i know far too well, it's chaos and having your world fliped on it's head. I could absolutely 100% identify with the confusion, the overwhelm and the fear for your life and safety. This is territory i know intimately.

Over the course of January, i was constantly trying to communicate with him, constantly asking what's happening, how he was, what his plan was, asking from any kind of clarity, that i love him and support him. I was telling him to come home, regroup, and go from there.

Khamra qahwa.

This right here is my first buy after lurking in this sub for about 6 months now and I am loving it.( people around me are not. ) 
This wasn't a blind buy.. i have been to malls and tried it earlier..so I knew what I was getting into.

Review : 

Smell :
well.. i am a total newbie so my nose isn't developed enough to tell every note but here goes..  it opened up with a strong smell of alcohol.. a little vanilla and a toffee.  ( which was different to what i had smelled when I tried it in a mall.) 
There was no coffee smell and it felt lighter.
 ( maybe it needs to mascarade) however the dry down was the same and i love it. 
It uplifts my mood every i smell it and I am glad I bought it. 

However if you are looking for compliments i got none with it. 
I wore it for my birthday ( also got it for the same reason) infact i got the opposite. Every single person was like it's okay we don't like it that much and that it is too strong. Also I heard that after I went out my.. house help was complaining that the small hurts his throat.. so I don't know about that XD.
Closet thing a compliment i got was as soon as my friend entered my car she said "" you smell like vanilla "" which was said less like a compliment and more like a fact.
But I don't care as whenever I smell myself i get a lot of joy and confidence. 
Overall i would rate this a 9/10 for smell.

Longevity:
An easy 10/10.
 Even after 20 hours i can smell it. 
I don't think anyone else can notice it except when I hug them or cuddle.

Price:
10/10
Got it for 2k and hey stays for a day and I love the smell.. looks worth the price to me.",44,1738491764.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,17,0.97,False

(my panic and anxiety disorder worsening for the first like 7 days probably because I couldn't stop ruminating on old traumatic experiences, left side chest pain being worse than usual, being really shaky and even more clumsy than I usually am, sweating a lot and basically feeling like I'm being boiled alive, on the second day I was kind of depressed and self injurious, tachycardia worsening and also my chronic pain as well as 5 year old shin splints has started getting worse around the 4th day)

But then somehow my sleep schedule got flipped around completely from being unable to sleep before 11am many days amd sleeping until 10pm to now waking up everyday around 9am no matter when I go to sleep and. actually getting up from bed too. Somehow all my possible bpd symptoms and even body dysmorphia have improved drastically. I don't feel hypomanic like sertraline made me feel instantly when I started it. Also my problems with just understanding words and articulating myself got instantly better which I wasn't expecting

Yesterday I had a massive panic attack all day because I had the amazing idea of after not being able to sleep for more than 2h to drink 3 big cups of coffee and around 3h later I had intense chest pain on the left side as well as extreme chest tightness, was unable to get an actually decent breath in, felt extremely nauseous and dizzy like I was going to pass out and throw up (which was sending me into extreme panic because I have really bad emetophobia), then two hours later at 5pm I got up and drank some water with electrolytes and cooked, but still felt nauseous. Like an hour after that I told my best friend who I like with that the chest pain was back and he called the emergency number for me and said I might need to get an EKG in an ambulance, but they called back and said since the chest pain ended 20 minutes before that there's no real danger.

Today day 8 I woke up with a horrible sore throat, more sinus pressure then usual and being generally quite fatigued and my right knee still hurts more often than usual as well as my nerve problems and blood circulation have gotten even worse 

I already have really dry eyes, skin, and mouth from my body just being super dry all the time. As well as chronic pain, but I'm wondering if I should remain hopeful for all the pain and stuff to go away (especially my resting heart rate going from high 90's to around 140bpm) or if I should give up already?
