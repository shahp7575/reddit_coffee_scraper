1loewmd,https://i.redd.it/8y9nerbfv3af1.png,Let's Talk Podcast Monetization - 7 Proven Ways to Actually Make Money from Your Podcast,"Hey podcasters! After seeing so many ""how do I monetize my podcast?"" posts, I wanted to share some practical monetization strategies that actually work.

**The Big 7 that most successful podcasters use:**

üéØ **Sponsorships** \- Industry standard is $18-25 per 1,000 downloads for traditional ads. Start reaching out once you hit 1,000+ downloads.

üí∞ **Affiliate Marketing** \- Promote products you actually use. Amazon Associates is beginner-friendly, and I still use it! But, higher-ticket items ($1K+ courses/tools) pay MUCH better commissions.

üì¶ **Your Own Products** \- Best ROI since you keep 100% profit. Digital products (courses, eBooks) have no shipping costs and can be sold repeatedly.

ü§ù **Services** \- Coaching, consulting, or freelance work. Your podcast is basically a portfolio proving your expertise.

‚òï **Donations** \- Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee, PayPal. Surprisingly effective if you have engaged listeners who value your content.

üé™ **Live Events** \- Workshops, masterminds, virtual conferences. High profit margins but requires more planning.

‚Çø **Cryptocurrency** \- Value4Value payments through Bitcoin ""boostagrams."" Growing trend in the podcasting world.

**Quick reality check:** You'll need at least 1,000 consistent downloads before most monetization becomes worthwhile. Focus on growing your audience first!

**The secret sauce:** Whatever you choose, make sure it genuinely helps your audience. The most successful podcast monetization feels natural, not forced.

I found a really comprehensive guide that breaks down these 7 methods PLUS 17 additional creative monetization ideas I hadn't even considered (like podcast licensing, corporate partnerships, and subscription boxes!).

Man, the world moves way too fast these days. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre all on a bullet train that never stops, and anyone who‚Äôs got a soft spot for feelings gets left at the station. Even love‚Äôs gone all ‚Äúmicrowave mode‚Äù‚Äîmeet someone, confess in five days, say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù in a week, and if it doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúeh, we‚Äôre not a match, see ya.‚ÄùBut I‚Äôm not about that.
I wanna be a slow-cooking pot, you know? No rush, no flashy moves, no trying to win someone over in record time. I‚Äôm not into ‚Äúhacks‚Äù to make you like me or sweet-talking you into thinking I‚Äôm the one. I just wanna take my time getting close, letting you figure out there‚Äôs a spot in my world that‚Äôs been waiting for you all along.Chapter 2: I‚Äôm Not Slow‚ÄîI‚Äôm Just Scared of Freaking You Out
People say I‚Äôm slow, but it‚Äôs not that. I just care a lot.
I‚Äôm terrified my feelings might come on too strong, like I‚Äôm barging into your space or dumping all my emotions on you. Picture you chilling with a smile, and then‚Äîbam‚Äîmy heart shows up like a sudden rainstorm, making you wanna bolt.Trust me, I know how to love. I just wanna do it gently.I want my vibe to be like handing you a warm coffee when you‚Äôre beat, or just saying ‚ÄúI got you‚Äù when you‚Äôre down, without any ‚Äúso what‚Äôs next?‚Äù pressure. I wanna be that cozy, sun-warmed blanket you don‚Äôt need to call amazing but can‚Äôt help wanting to snuggle up with. I‚Äôm not great at flirty lines or nailing the perfect moment, but I‚Äôm cool with being the dork who waits for you, even if you don‚Äôt spot me right away.To me, love‚Äôs not a race or a deal. It‚Äôs like two people getting lost in the woods and finding each other, both ready to drop the tough act and just chill together. I want you to see I‚Äôm real‚Äînot through some big ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù speech, but through the little things I do to make sure you‚Äôre never uncomfortable.If my slow pace ever made you walk past me, maybe I wasn‚Äôt warm enough to make you stop and look. But if you‚Äôre down to wait, I promise I‚Äôll take you to places I‚Äôd never go alone, sharing views I‚Äôve saved just for you.Chapter 3: Going Slow Is My Way of Being Kind
I used to think loving someone meant throwing everything at them‚Äîevery thought, every fear, every dream, all at once.Then I hit rock bottom and treated her like my only lifeline, like I was a sinking ship and she was the one piece of wood keeping me afloat. Turns out, I wasn‚Äôt loving her right‚ÄîI was loving too hard.That piece of wood can‚Äôt hold up an entire ocean. She wasn‚Äôt trying to ditch me; she was just figuring out how to keep herself afloat too.That‚Äôs when I got it: you can‚Äôt dump all your love at once. It‚Äôs like making soup‚Äîyou don‚Äôt just toss in the salt right away. You let it simmer, let the flavors come out, then figure out what it needs.I had this whole plan to take her out, have a perfect day, every detail mapped out‚Äîwhere we‚Äôd go, what we‚Äôd eat. But before I could hit send on that text, her goodbye beat me to it.That night, staring at my phone, I knew her gentle excuses were just that‚Äîexcuses. But I didn‚Äôt call her out. Not because I didn‚Äôt want answers, but because I didn‚Äôt wanna make her feel bad.I let her have her kind lie, choosing to be the guy who knows the truth but keeps it chill. I didn‚Äôt wanna trap her with ‚Äúwhy‚Äù or make her last memory of me be all tears and guilt.I learned to stay quiet and hold onto the moments that felt real. She was so kind, the only light in my darkest days.She showed me love isn‚Äôt about finding someone to fix all your broken pieces. It‚Äôs about starting to patch yourself up and meeting someone who‚Äôs cool holding your hand along the way.Chapter 4: I‚Äôm Saving My Big Feelings for Someone Who Won‚Äôt Run
I used to wanna spill all my feelings, make her see how much I cared, how much I loved her. But I learned love‚Äôs about holding back sometimes, keeping those big emotions in my pocket.Not because I‚Äôm cold or don‚Äôt care, but because I know not everyone‚Äôs ready for that kind of heat. I don‚Äôt want my feelings to stress you out or make you feel like you‚Äôre carrying too much. I‚Äôm scared that lifeline might snap if I lean too hard.So I‚Äôm learning to take it easy, save some of that warmth for myself and some for the person who‚Äôll show up one day‚Äîthe one who‚Äôs okay with simmering soup with me, not rushing the clock. Someone who‚Äôll see me get better and let me see their soft side and their strength.I‚Äôm not trying to win your heart with a quick spark. I wanna find the good stuff together, in the little everyday moments. Like my dad says, mountains don‚Äôt move‚Äîthey wait for you to climb them slow.I‚Äôll be here, waiting for someone who‚Äôs cool with slow, ready to hike up together and catch our own sunrise.

## Key Features Analysis

The appeal of sand and fog candles lies in a combination of factors, not just their scents. Quality ingredients, aesthetically pleasing designs, and lasting burn times all play a vital part.

**Wax Composition:** The type of wax used substantially impacts the candle's performance and scent throw. Sand and fog candles typically utilize soy wax blends, paraffin wax, or a combination of both.

Soy wax, derived from soybeans, is a renewable and sustainable resource. It burns cleaner and slower than paraffin wax,producing less soot,making it a preferable choice for those conscious of air quality. However, soy wax often has a lower scent throw compared to paraffin. Paraffin wax,a byproduct of petroleum refining,offers a robust scent throw and is more affordable.Many sand and fog candles opt for a blend to balance scent projection with clean burning.

**Fragrance Oils:** The quality and concentration of fragrance oils determine the complexity and longevity of the scent. Sand and fog candles distinguish themselves through their carefully curated scent profiles, frequently enough incorporating essential oils and natural extracts.

These candles often feature layered fragrances that evolve over time, providing a more immersive sensory experience. The top notes initially dominate, followed by the middle and base notes, creating a well-rounded olfactory journey. High-end sand and fog candles disclose the concentration of fragrance oils used which is a good indicator of the strength and duration of the scent.**Wick Material:** The wick plays a critical role in the burning process, influencing the flame size, burn consistency, and soot production. Sand and fog candles predominantly utilize cotton wicks or wooden wicks.Cotton wicks are commonly used for their reliable performance and even burn. Their thickness is carefully selected based on the candle's diameter to ensure optimal wax consumption and prevent tunneling.Wooden wicks, create a distinctive crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace, are gaining popularity for their ambiance.They also tend to produce a wider melt pool, maximizing scent diffusion, but require occasional trimming to maintain a clean burn.

**Container Design:** The aesthetic appeal of the container contributes significantly to the candle's overall allure. Sand and fog candles are frequently enough housed in elegant glass jars or ceramic vessels, designed to complement various home decor styles.

Their containers often feature minimalist designs with subtle color palettes or textured finishes, reflecting a sophisticated aesthetic. The jars are often reusable,adding to the candle's appeal for environmentally conscious consumers. The dimensions of the container also influence the burn pool area, which in turn correlates with how strong and far that the fragrance can distribute in the room.

**Burn Time:** Burn time varies depending on the candle size, wax type, and wick configuration. Sand and fog candles offer a range of sizes to accommodate different needs and preferences.

Smaller candles, ranging from 6-8 ounces, typically offer burn times of 40-50 hours. Larger candles, exceeding 12 ounces, can last for 60 hours or more.Factors such as room temperature and airflow can affect the rate at which the candle burns.

## Core Benefits

Beyond their aesthetic appeal, sand and fog candles provide several tangible benefits that enhance the home surroundings.

**Enhanced Ambiance:** The carefully crafted scents of sand and fog candles can profoundly impact mood and atmosphere. Specific fragrances evoke feelings of relaxation,energy,or nostalgia,transforming any space into a sanctuary.A candle with lavender and chamomile notes can promote relaxation in a bedroom, while a citrus-scented candle can invigorate a home office. The soft glow of the candle flame adds a touch of warmth and intimacy, and creates a calming atmosphere.

**Odor Neutralization:** Sand and fog candles effectively neutralize unpleasant odors, replacing them with refreshing and inviting fragrances.This is particularly beneficial in kitchens, bathrooms, or areas prone to lingering smells.A candle with notes of cedarwood and clove can effectively eliminate cooking odors, while a candle with eucalyptus and mint can freshen up a bathroom. The fragrance oils work to mask and absorb unwanted odors, creating a more pleasant environment.**Stress Reduction:** Studies have demonstrated that certain scents can reduce stress and promote relaxation.The aromatherapy benefits of sand and fog candles can contribute to a sense of well-being and mental clarity.

A candle with sandalwood and frankincense notes can help to reduce anxiety and promote mindfulness. Inhaling these fragrances can trigger relaxation responses in the brain, leading to a calmer state of mind.

## FAQs Section

consumers often have questions about the composition, safety, and usage of sand and fog candles. Here are some common inquiries addressed:

**Are sand and fog candles safe for pets and children?**
While sand and fog candles are generally safe, it's essential to exercise caution when burning them around pets and children. Ensure the candle is placed out of reach, and never leave a burning candle unattended. Some fragrance oils can be irritating to sensitive animals,so consider opting for candles with natural essential oils.

**How can I prevent tunneling when burning a sand and fog candle?**
Tunneling occurs when a candle burns down the center, leaving a ring of un-melted wax around the edges. To prevent this, allow the candle to burn long enough for the entire surface layer of wax to melt fully on the first burn. Trim the wick to ¬º inch before each use.

**How do I properly dispose of a sand and fog candle container?**
Once the candle is completely consumed, carefully remove any remaining wax residue. Many sand and fog candle containers can be repurposed as decorative jars, storage containers, or plant holders. Properly clean and dry before repurposing. Always check local regulations for glass and ceramic recycling.

**Are sand and fog candles all-natural and eco-friendly?**
While some sand and fog candles are marketed as natural, it is crucial to carefully examine the ingredient list. Many candles use a blend of natural and synthetic fragrances. To ensure you are purchasing an eco-friendly option, look for candles made with 100% soy wax, essential oils, and cotton or wooden wicks. Look for certifications of sustainability.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Inter Milan vs. Fluminense Prediction: A Nap in Disguise (With a Side of Prop Bets)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match that‚Äôs less *‚Äúfootball‚Äù* and more *‚Äúwhy did I skip my nap?‚Äù* Inter Milan (-150) are the favorites to advance, but Fluminense (+450) have the xG defense of a vault and the tactics of a man who‚Äôs seen *‚ÄúInception‚Äù* 47 times. Let‚Äôs break it down with the humor of a man who‚Äôs seen both teams‚Äô attacking stats.

### The Odds, Briefly

* **Moneyline**: Inter Milan is the pick for most bettors (-150 to -165), but Fluminense‚Äôs +425 odds make them a dark horse if you‚Äôre into surprises.
* **Totals**: The Under 2.5 goals line is a *sellout* (1.62-1.66), because neither team plays offense like a dating app.
* **Spreads**: Inter -0.75 is the line if you‚Äôre betting on a team that *technically* wins but *emotionally* draws.

### Player Props: Because Why Not?

* **Lautaro Mart√≠nez** (-130) is the *only* Inter player you need to bet on. He‚Äôs the reason Inter‚Äôs offense isn‚Äôt a slow Wi-Fi connection.
* **Marcus Thuram** (-240) is the *most exciting* Inter forward, which is like saying a toaster is the life of the party.
* **Fluminense‚Äôs Jhon Arias** (+600) is the ‚Äúdark horse‚Äù goal scorer. If ‚Äúdark horse‚Äù means ‚Äúunlikely to score but fun to pretend about.‚Äù

### The Prediction

Inter Milan will win 1-0, with Lautaro Martinez scoring the only goal in the 89th minute while Fluminense‚Äôs defense is mentally checking out for coffee. The first half will have fewer shots on target than a dating profile in 2013.

**Why?**

* Inter‚Äôs midfield (*Barella, Asllani, Dumfries*) will look like a spreadsheet trying to *look* exciting.
* Fluminense‚Äôs defense will be the second-most-tightest thing in this tournament, after the *‚Äúwhy did I eat that third slice of pizza?‚Äù* regret in your gut.

### The Best Bets

1. **Inter Milan ML** (-150): Because they‚Äôre the only team with players who‚Äôve heard of the *‚Äúoffside trap.‚Äù*
2. **Under 2.5 Goals** (1.62): Because both teams‚Äô offenses are on a *strict diet of broths and regret*.
3. **Same-game parlay**: Fluminense advance + 1H Under 0.5 goals (21/1). For the thrill of losing *twice* in one bet.

### Final Thoughts

This game is the sports equivalent of a *‚Äúmeh‚Äù* emoji. Bet on Inter, but bring a pillow. And if Fluminense somehow pull off the upset? Congrats, you‚Äôve officially seen the impossible.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a match‚Äîit‚Äôs a sleep study with better lighting.‚Äù*

1loerhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1loerhc/her_wedding_invitation_shattered_his_cold_heart/,Her Wedding Invitation Shattered His Cold Heart by Chloe Winter:,"Three years ago, Emerald Ramirez was exiled for loving the one man she couldn‚Äôt have‚Äîher adoptive brother, Winston. Now, she‚Äôs back with a wedding invitation in hand, determined to prove she‚Äôs moved on. But the moment she steps into Winston‚Äôs world, she finds him entangled with another woman, his icy gaze daring her to react. When she declares her engagement, Winston tears the invitation to shreds, refusing to believe her.

# Chapter 1 - A Wedding Invitation and a Cold Reunion

Three years ago, Emerald Ramirez was banished overseas for falling in love with Winston Ramirez, forbidden to return unless she gave up her feelings for him.

Three years later, she came back.

Because she was getting married.

The first thing Emerald did upon stepping onto familiar soil was march straight to Winston‚Äôs private lounge with her suitcase in tow to deliver a wedding invitation.

When she pushed open the door, she froze.

Winston sat at the center of the couch, a cigarette between his long fingers, his sharp features half-hidden behind tendrils of smoke. Across from him, a girl in a white sundress clutched a letter, her cheeks flushed as she stammered,

""Winston... I‚Äôve had feelings for you for so long...""

The room fell silent.

Emerald hadn‚Äôt expected to walk in on a love confession. She hesitated in the doorway, unsure whether to step forward or retreat.

Before Winston could respond, one of his friends spotted her and whistled. ""Well, well, look who‚Äôs back‚Äîthe Ramirez family‚Äôs little princess? When did you crawl home?""

Every head in the room turned toward her.

Winston‚Äôs gaze turned glacial the moment he saw her.

""Didn‚Äôt they say you weren‚Äôt allowed back unless you got over him?"" His friend smirked. ""Thought three years abroad would‚Äôve knocked some sense into you, but I guess old habits die hard.""

Winston‚Äôs eyes lingered on her for a heartbeat before he abruptly yanked the girl in white closer. ""Sure,"" he said flatly, ""why not?"" Then he kissed her‚Äîhard, almost brutal.

Emerald stood rooted to the spot.

The kiss was rough, bordering on cruel. The girl gasped, fingers clutching his shirt. When he finally pulled away, he kept an arm around her waist and fixed Emerald with a bored stare.

""When did you get back?""

""Just now."" Her voice was eerily calm.

""Couldn‚Äôt resist seeing me?"" He flicked ash from his cigarette. ""Remember what I told you when I sent you away?""

""I remember."" She took a steadying breath. ""'Don‚Äôt come back unless you‚Äôve moved on.'""

""So?""

""So I have."" She pulled an embossed invitation from her bag and held it out. ""I‚Äôm here to deliver my wedding invitation.""

Dead silence.

Winston stared at the invitation, his expression darkening like a gathering storm. Then, in one swift motion, he snatched it and tore it to pieces.

""You‚Äôd lie just to get my attention?"" He laughed coldly. ""You‚Äôve got some nerve, Emerald.""

His friends sneered. ""Who‚Äôre you trying to fool? Everyone knows you‚Äôre hung up on Winston.""

Her nails bit into her palms.

Yes, three years ago, she had been obsessed.

After her parents died, the Ramirez family took her in. Winston, five years older, became her adoptive brother.

And he spoiled her rotten.

When she had a fever, he stayed by her bedside for three days straight. When she begged to go skiing, he canceled a billion-dollar deal to take her to the Alps. If she so much as glanced at a piece of jewelry, it appeared in her hands the next morning. If she mentioned liking a car, he filled a garage with them.

They were the picture-perfect siblings‚Äîuntil her eighteenth birthday, when she woke from a drunken haze to find him kissing her in the dark.

Her heart had raced.

He feels it too.

So the next day, she confessed.

And he shut her down cold. ""Emerald, this will never happen.""

She thought he was just afraid to cross the line, so she pursued him harder.

She even played sick once, burning with fever as she pressed against him, guiding his hand beneath her skirt, begging him to touch her‚Äî

The moment his fingers brushed her skin, she shuddered and whimpered.

That night, his eyes had been dark with something primal, like she‚Äôd dragged him down from his pedestal.

But the next morning, he shipped her overseas.

""Don‚Äôt ever come back,"" he‚Äôd said at the airport, voice like ice. ""Not unless you‚Äôve moved on.""

The memory cut off abruptly. She met his gaze now.

""I‚Äôm not lying. I am getting married.""

Winston shot to his feet and closed the distance between them in three strides. ""Say that again.""

His friend grabbed his arm. ""Chill, man, she‚Äôs still your sister! No need to lose your cool. Besides, you‚Äôve got a girlfriend now‚Äîshe should finally take the hint‚Äî""

Winston studied her for a long moment before smiling coldly. ""Right. Almost forgot to introduce you."" He tightened his grip on the girl. ""This is Valerie Garcia. My girlfriend. So stop making a fool of yourself.""

Then he dragged Valerie toward the door.

""Where you headed?"" his friend called after them.

Winston didn‚Äôt look back.

""Hotel.""

# Chapter 2 - A Broken Heart's Final Goodbye

""It looks like this time it's for real...""

After the protagonist left, the private room quickly emptied out.

Soon, only Emerald Ramirez remained.

She knelt to gather the torn pieces of the wedding invitation scattered on the floor, carefully tucking each fragment back into her bag.

By the time she stepped outside the club, night had fallen.

Just as she was about to cross the street, an electric scooter came barreling toward her‚Äî

Crash!

She hit the pavement, her knees searing with pain as blood seeped through her stockings.

At that moment, a Maybach pulled up beside her.

Valerie Garcia‚Äôs voice drifted through the open window: ""Winston, your sister just got hit. Should we take her to the hospital?""

The window rolled down, but he didn‚Äôt even glance her way. ""Don‚Äôt bother. I don‚Äôt need her latching onto me again.""

Every word sliced through her like a blade.

His car sped off without another word.

Emerald pushed herself up from the ground, her eyes burning.

How many times did she have to say it for him to believe her?

She really wouldn‚Äôt cling to him anymore.

And she wouldn‚Äôt love him anymore, either.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. Fumbling to pull it out, she saw Jaden Parker‚Äôs name on the screen.

The moment she answered, his warm, soothing voice filled her ear.

""Sweetheart, are you home yet? Wedding prep‚Äôs about to eat up all my time, so I might not be able to call every day. Don‚Äôt be mad, okay? Just ten more days, and I‚Äôll finally make you my wife‚Äîthen I can see you whenever I want.""

Jaden Parker‚ÄîWinston‚Äôs best friend.

He had followed her abroad the day after she left.

For three years, she‚Äôd survived gunfights, robberies, and nights stranded on the streets with nothing. Every time, he‚Äôd been there to shield her.

At her lowest, he‚Äôd cradled her face and whispered, ""Emerald, marry me. Come home with me.""

So, for three years, she‚Äôd forced herself to let go of Winston.

And she‚Äôd finally, truly, accepted Jaden.

A faint smile touched her lips, warmth softening her gaze. ""I'll be waiting.""

When she pushed open the front door, her adoptive parents sat in the living room, sipping coffee.

Her mother set her cup down the moment she saw her, brows knitting. ""Emerald? We agreed you wouldn‚Äôt come back unless you gave up on Winston.""

Her father‚Äôs expression darkened. ""What‚Äôs gotten into you? Do you want our family to be the talk of high society‚Äî""

""Mom, Dad,"" Emerald cut in, pulling an embossed wedding invitation from her bag and placing it on the coffee table. ""I came back to get married.""

They froze, flipping open the invitation‚Äîand immediately saw the groom‚Äôs name in gold script: Jaden Parker.

Silence filled the room.

""...Jaden?"" Her mother‚Äôs voice softened slightly. ""You‚Äôre marrying Jaden? Does Winston know?""

""I told him.""

Even if he didn‚Äôt believe me.

""That‚Äôs good."" Her father exhaled. ""Just... stay out of Winston‚Äôs way.""

Emerald nodded and headed upstairs.

That night, she dreamed for the first time in years.

In the dream, it was her eighteenth birthday. Drunk, she‚Äôd been carried to her room by Winston. Half-asleep, she‚Äôd felt lips brush against hers‚Äîsoft, warm, carrying the faintest hint of sandalwood.

Then the scene shifted to that night, when she‚Äôd drugged herself, feverish as she clung to him.

""Please, Winston...""

His breath had been ragged, his hands tracing her skin‚Äîonly to stop at the last moment, choosing to help her with just his touch.

But the next morning, he‚Äôd shoved her away coldly and shipped her off abroad that same day.

Emerald jolted awake, her forehead damp with sweat.

All these years, she‚Äôd never understood‚Äîhow could Winston be so conflicted?

If he‚Äôd loved her, if he‚Äôd kissed her first... why had he pushed her away again and again, insisting he felt nothing?

But now, she was getting married.

And she didn‚Äôt care to understand anymore.

# Chapter 3 - A Fall from Grace

At the restaurant, Winston Ramirez and Valerie Garcia were enjoying breakfast.

""Emerald!"" Valerie's face brightened when she spotted her. ""Perfect timing! Winston's friends are throwing a party tonight. You should come with us!""

Winston scowled. ""She's not invited.""

""Why not?"" Valerie tugged his sleeve. ""Emerald just got back‚Äîwouldn't it be great for her to socialize? The more, the merrier!""

Winston shot Emerald a glance but didn't argue further.

Nobody had bothered to ask for her input.

Emerald found herself practically dragged along by Valerie.

The gathering took place at an upscale private club.

Winston's friends raised eyebrows when they noticed Emerald but offered polite greetings‚Äîthough their thinly veiled contempt was unmistakable.

All evening, Winston doted exclusively on Valerie.

He served her dishes, dabbed her lips, even kissed her fingertips when she pretended to sulk.

His buddies ribbed him, ""Damn, Winston's really got it bad this time!""

""No joke‚ÄîValerie's the first girl he's ever introduced to the crew!""

Blushing, Valerie snuggled against Winston, who pulled her closer with a tender smile.

Emerald sat silently in the shadows, forgotten.

When someone suggested a drinking game, Valerie immediately roped in Emerald and Winston.

First round‚ÄîValerie lost.

The forfeit? A one-minute kiss with someone of the opposite sex.

She cast a coy glance at Winston, who immediately cradled her head and kissed her deeply.

The room exploded with whoops and cheers.

Several guests shot nervous looks at Emerald, expecting a scene.

She remained motionless, her face unreadable.

Second round‚ÄîEmerald lost.

""Punishment‚Äîcall your most recent contact!""

Reluctantly, she pulled out her phone and checked her call log.

Her most recent contact was saved as: ""My Love.""

Winston's expression darkened. ""Who the hell is that?""

""My fianc√©.""

Dead silence. The group exchanged glances that clearly said, ""Yeah, right.""

When the call connected, Winston's face turned to stone.

He glared at the screen as if trying to vaporize it with his eyes.

Then the automated recording announced, ""The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.""

His shoulders relaxed slightly while the others smirked, their disbelief growing.

""Come on, Emerald,"" someone jeered. ""Playing games? That act never worked on Winston. Why embarrass yourself?""

Emerald stayed silent. Explanations were pointless.

Fortunately, the mood for games evaporated. Emerald slipped away to the restroom.

On her return, she overheard Winston's friends around the corner.

""That sister of yours won't take a hint. We thought shipping her overseas would fix her, but she's back to pestering him. Like some pathetic stalker.""

""Winston, what's your take?""

""My take?"" Winston's voice could have frozen hell. ""The most embarrassing moment of my life was when my adopted sister declared her feelings.""

Emerald went rigid.

Embarrassing?

So her love was nothing but shame to him.

""Did you catch that?"" Valerie's smug whisper came from behind. ""He thinks you're pathetic.""

Emerald refused to engage with such transparent theatrics. She turned to leave.

Valerie seized her arm. ""Who are you trying to fool with this act?""

""Let go.""

""Make me!"" Valerie didn't just hold on‚Äîshe shoved her violently.

Emerald staggered backward‚Äî

""CRASH!""

She tumbled down the staircase.

Agony radiated through her body as she crumpled on the floor, vision blurring.

Guests rushed out at the commotion. ""What happened?""

Valerie gasped theatrically. ""Oh my God‚Äîshe just fell!""

""You‚Äîyou pushed me‚Äî"" Emerald's voice shook with pain.

Winston had knelt to help, but froze at her accusation.

""Emerald,"" he said icily, ""here we go again with your drama?""

# Chapter 4 - A Storm of Betrayal and Broken Dreams

Valerie Garcia's eyes were red and swollen from crying. ""Winston, just let it go. I don't mind taking the hit. We should get her to the hospital first‚Äî""""Not happening."" Winston Ramirez rose to his feet, his expression glacial.......

1loer14,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1loer14/im_a_detective_i_was_called_to_a_domestic_dispute/,I'm a detective. I was called to a domestic dispute between a husband and a wife. Their son told me they eat people.,"The report lay on my desk. The words were printed there in stark black ink. ‚ÄúDomestic Disturbance. Cormorant‚Äôs Perch Island.‚Äù The address was printed at the top, and below were the names. ‚ÄúElias and Elara Vance.‚Äù

""A domestic on the Perch? That‚Äôs a new one,"" I said, and the springs of my chair groaned under my weight. ""They usually handle their own business.""

Sergeant O‚ÄôMalley worked his crossword and did not look up. He had a face creased with a permanent judgment against the world and all its doings. 

""Noise complaint came from their nearest neighbor, old man Hemlock. Said they were going at it loud enough to scare the gulls off his roof. A lot of smashing, apparently. The Vances haven't been answering the line since."" He raised his head and in his eyes you could see the pale, flat blue of a winter sky over a dead ocean. ""You‚Äôre up, Harper.""

""Me? Don't you think sending a familiar face, like Gibbs, might be better? Those folks are‚Ä¶ particular.""

""Gibbs has got a multi-car pile up on the causeway,"" O‚ÄôMalley said. ""And you need to learn how to deal with the 'particulars' if you ever want to make a career in this coastal jurisdiction. It's just a lovers' quarrel. Go over there, knock some heads, tell them to keep it down, and be back before lunch."" He nodded with his chin toward the pistol on my hip. ""And you know the islanders‚Äô rules about mainland formalities. Leave that here. It spooks them.""

""You want me to go to an island known for its hostility to outsiders to mediate a potentially violent domestic dispute, unarmed?""

""It‚Äôs not hostile, it's private,"" he said. ""And they‚Äôre not savages, Alex. They're fishermen and farmers who want to be left alone. A uniform is authority enough. Now go.""

I rose and unclipped the sidearm from my belt. 

The island was a twenty minute boat ride from mainland. The hundred or so that lived there lived by their own reckonings. They schooled their children in a one room house and sent them out onto the water when they came of age. 

They bartered and they kept to themselves and they only crossed to the mainland for what the island couldn‚Äôt provide. They had their own laws and an old man to speak them and for their trouble to find its way to our desks on the mainland meant the trouble was serious. 

The deck of the ferry was cold beneath my feet. A low gray mist lay upon the water and shrouded all things from sight. It muffled the drone of the engine and swallowed the world until the mainland dissolved into a smear of gray behind us. 

The Perch grew out of the void ahead, a dark up-thrust of rock and pine that clawed at the sky. Then you could see the houses, bleached white things that clung to the stone or clustered near the harbor like seafoam caught in a crevice. 

An old woman sat hunched on a bench in a thick wool shawl. She was the only other soul aboard and she looked at the water and not at me and she did not speak.

When the ferry groaned and nudged the dock timbers I was the only one to stand. I stepped onto the wet wood and the air was another air altogether. The salt of it and the reek of pine and the smoke of wood fires burning somewhere beyond the stony rise. An older quiet was here. No sound of cars, no human call. Just the wind and the gulls. 

Some men in oilskins and heavy sweaters worked on nets by a beached boat. Their hands moved with a slowness that bespoke a world without clocks. They stopped their work to watch me come ashore and their eyes read the blue uniform and then they turned away. No word.

I looked at a faded map that was nailed to a post by the dock. Their house was at the far end of the village and I set out on that path.

The houses were old things built to stand against the wind and the sea, scrubbed clean against the rot, and nets lay draped on fences like grave shrouds. There were gardens starved by the salt wind but still showing color. 

I saw faces in the dark glass of windows, pale specters that watched my passing and then were gone. And then I saw the house. It was a cottage like the others but set apart from them.

In the garden a clay pot lay shattered upon the stone walk and its dark soil was spilled out amongst the ruin of red flowers. Through a window left open to the wind I could hear the sounds. A man‚Äôs low rumble and a woman‚Äôs sharp answer. 

They were still at it. 

I drew a lungful of cold air to ready myself and I knocked my fist against the door. Inside, all sound stopped. A long quiet. Then the door groaned on its hinges and opened into the dark of the house.

The man who stood in the doorframe was a wall of bulk and weathered hide that filled the space of the door. He wore a beard and his hands were the size of quarry stones, stained about the quicks of his nails with a blackness like engine grease or old blood. 

This would be Elias Vance. His eyes held a hard light, but when they fell upon the blue of my uniform some of that light seemed to fail, leaving behind what might‚Äôve been shame or only surprise. 

In the dimness of the house beyond him a woman stood with her arms crossed over her. Her hair was red and it was twisted up in a knot at the back of her head. On the floorboards near her feet lay a broken plate.

""Elias Vance?"" I said. ""I'm Detective Alex Harper, from the mainland precinct. We received a complaint about a disturbance.""

He gave a noise in his throat that was not a word and stepped back from the door. I entered into a smell of brine and stewed herbs and some other scent beneath that was the scent of the house itself, of old wood and old sorrows. 

The space was neat except for the evidence of their war. The broken plate. A stool overturned on its side. And on the stairs that climbed into the darkness of the second floor a boy sat watching us with wide and unnervingly still eyes.

""There's no need for mainland business here,"" Elara Vance said. ""My husband and I were having a private discussion. That gossip Hemlock should learn to mind his own business.""

""A discussion that involves breaking things and shouting loud enough for your neighbors to hear is no longer private, ma'am,"" I said. ""I do not want to put this in a report. I only want to know what happened and see that everyone is okay. Is anyone hurt?""

Elias stared at the floorboards and his jaw was tight. It was the woman who spoke. ""He gets these fits of temper. It's how he is. He believes I am careless.""

""Careless with what?"" I asked. 

""With our traditions,"" Elias said, his voice was a low rumble from the pit of his chest. ""She forgets the importance of things. She becomes‚Ä¶ lenient."" 

His eyes were on her then, a look that was not simple anger but a deeper and more searing judgment, as if she had broken some covenant between them.

""The traditions haven't kept our stores full for the winter, have they?"" she said. ""Sometimes you have to adapt. Be practical.""

""Alright alright,"" I said, holding up my hands as if to ward off a blow. ""Look, I can tell you're both passionate people. I'm not here to take sides or to pry into your island ways. I‚Äôm only here to make sure disagreements don't become dangerous. Has there been any physical violence? Elias, did you lay a hand on your wife?""

""Never,"" he said. He looked at me as if the question itself were the offense. ""I would never harm Elara.""

""And you, Elara?"" I asked, turning to her. ""Did you feel threatened?""

She drew a breath, and her gaze moved from my face to her husband‚Äôs and back again as if weighing two different kinds of trouble. ""He is loud,"" she said. ""But other than that, no, Detective. He did not hurt me.""

""Then I am calling it a quarrel that went past its bounds,"" I said. ""But I will have to file a minor report. You should know that if we are called back to this house for this reason, the law will take a harder hand. Do you understand?""

They both gave a short, silent nod. 

The fury had not left the room but it had drawn back into the corners. A strange and weary quiet took its place. Elias went to the spot on the floor and he knelt and with his great hands began to gather the larger shards of the plate. 

The woman watched him for a long moment, and a look passed over her face that I could not read, and then she turned and went into the kitchen and I heard the scrape of a kettle being set upon the stove.

I was scratching a note in my book when I felt the weight of his stare. The boy on the stairs had not moved. He sat pale in the gloom and lost inside his clothes. His eyes were like holes burned in a blanket. The argument had taken root in him in a way it had not in his parents. 

The peace had been made, such as it was. I could take the afternoon ferry back across the water and set the strange accounting of it down on paper. I snapped the book shut and I slipped the weight of it into my coat. 

The woman Elara returned from the darkness of the kitchen. She would not meet my eye but looked instead toward her husband as he stood like a beast of burden by the door. 

""Elias, fetch some driftwood for the evening fire,"" she said, and her voice was not a wife's request but a command given to dismiss him from her sight. So she might offer up some parting lie of peace before sending me from her house.

Elias looked at me a final time, and the storm was still in his face, but he gave a curt nod of his head and turned and was gone out the back door into the gray light. When he was gone it was as if some great weight had been lifted from the low timbers of that house.

""Thank you for your visit, Detective Harper,"" Elara said, and her voice was softer now. ""I am sorry for the trouble.""

""It's no trouble at all, ma'am. I just want to ensure things remain peaceful here,"" I said, and I moved toward the door. ""Domestic disputes can be unsettling for everyone. Especially children."" I turned my head to where the boy still sat on the stairs. ""Is he doing alright?""

""Finn is a sensitive boy,"" she said, and she made a gesture with her hand as if shooing a fly, as if his nature were a defect she had learned to abide. ""He has an active imagination.""

As I stood on the threshold I felt a sudden and urgent claim on the hem of my coat. I turned and the boy was there. He stood behind me with a strange look on his face. He looked past me into the house to where his mother worked by the hearth, and he made sure she was not looking.

""I need to tell you something,"" he whispered.

I crouched down and looked into his face. 

""What is it Finn? You can tell me.""

He leaned to me and his hand was a small cold fist clenching the cloth of my jacket. 

His eyes were wild with a terror that had no place in the heart of a child.

""They're not fighting about what you think,"" he whispered. ""It‚Äôs about people from the mainland. It's always about them.""

""What about them Finn?""

He swallowed, and his gaze flew to the gray and twisted trees. Then he leaned so close his lips were nearly at my ear.

""My mum and dad,"" he said. ""They eat them. They eat people from the mainland.""

The words landed in the plain air and they meant nothing. The notion of it. Cannibalism? On an island a stone‚Äôs throw from a modern American town? It was preposterous. It had to be a child‚Äôs interpretation of something ugly he‚Äôd heard. 

I set the words aside as you would a piece of stone that did not fit the wall you were building. I reached out and with a gentle pull I loosened his hand from my coat. I gave him a smile.

""Hey, it‚Äôs alright,"" I said. ""Grown ups say some pretty scary sounding things when they‚Äôre angry, don't they? Sometimes it sounds like they could 'eat each other alive.' It's just an expression. It doesn't mean it's real. Your parents love you, and they don‚Äôt eat anyone. I promise.""

But the boy was not comforted. He looked at me and his face collapsed into a mask of pure and desolating grief. It was the look of a true believer who has been met with apostasy. The tears stood in his eyes but did not fall. 

""No,"" he whispered. ""You don't understand. You *don't* understand."" He turned from me then and fled, his small feet in their socks making no sound on the wood of the floor, and he was gone up the stairs into the shadows of the house.

I stood and turned my back. I had done my work here. It was time to leave this quiet desolation and return to the mainland where things could be measured and made sense of. 

I began to walk. But the boy's whisper went with me. It was a stubborn and unwelcome shadow that the sun could not burn away.

The boy‚Äôs words had planted a seed of disquiet in my mind and while I told myself that this was a child's fiction born from a house of unhappy truth, reason would not set my heart at ease.

 I told myself that the human mind will invent monsters to explain the sorrows of the world, for the monsters can be slain.

I was halfway to the ferry landing where the gray water lapped at the timbers of the dock when a voice called out to me, a voice rich and warm. ""Detective! A moment, if you would be so kind.""

I turned and saw an old man seated upon a bench that had been hewn from a single great log of driftwood. He had a beard that flowed down his chest, white as seafoam, and his eyes were a startling and brilliant blue. 

In his hands he held a piece of wood and a small knife and from the wood he was coaxing the shape of a bird. His smile was not like the other faces I had seen here. It was a true and genuine thing that creased the old map of his face and it was a thing that could disarm a man before he knew he had been armed. He radiated a calm and settled authority. This was the island's elder.

""Good day, sir,"" I said, and I walked to where he sat. ""Detective Alex Harper. You must be Malachi.""

""Indeed I am,"" he replied, his voice was a deep and comforting burr. ""And I would guess, from the grim set of your shoulders as you arrived and the slightly less troubled look upon you now, that you have successfully poured oil on the troubled waters at the Vance household.""

""Something like that,"" I said. ""It seems to have been settled for the time being. Hopefully they‚Äôll keep it down from now on.""

""Elias has a hard head and Elara a sharp tongue,"" Malachi said, and he chuckled low in his chest as his knife continued its deft and practiced work. ""It is an unfortunate pairing of temperaments at times. But their hearts are true to our ways. We are grateful you made the trip, Detective. It relieves me of having to deliver a harsher island judgment."" He stopped his work then and looked up at me, and his gaze was both kind and possessed of a deep and knowing power. ""But you look weary from your journey. You are already headed back to the mainland then? What a pity.""

""Well, my work here is done, and‚Ä¶"" I let the words fall away, for I would not tell this man that his island had creeped me out.

""But your visit is so short!"" Malachi exclaimed, and a look of true disappointment crossed his face. ""You mainlanders are always in such a rush. You never stop to truly see our little world. It truly is a shame, because you arrive on our shores at a most auspicious time. Our annual Harvest Festival is in just two days.""

He said the words Harvest Festival as if they were a benediction, and his eyes took on a light of deep and holy reverence. ""It is the highlight of our year,"" he said. ""A celebration of the sea's bounty, the season‚Äôs turn. There is music, dancing, a great feast. It is a spectacle I assure you cannot be found anywhere on your side of the water. A real piece of living history.""

A curiosity rose in me against my better judgment. It was a lure and I was a fish rising to it. ""A festival, you say? I suppose I could stay. I do have a couple of personal days I could take.""

A beatific smile bloomed upon Malachi‚Äôs face. ""Excellent! I would consider it a personal honor, and a wonderful gesture of goodwill between the Perch and the mainland authorities. It shows us you care beyond the matters of law enforcement. Please, stay as our guest."" He pointed with the tip of his knife down a path that led away from the dock. ""Old Martha runs a small guesthouse just off the cove. The 'Mariner's Rest.' She will make you feel right at home. I will inform her to expect you.""

The offer was warm and heartfelt, it smothered the last of the boy‚Äôs dark whisper. The Elder himself was inviting me. This was the path of reason. This was an offer of peace, an unplanned holiday on an island of strange and simple folk.

""Alright, Malachi,"" I said, and I heard myself laugh. ""You've convinced me. Thank you.""

""The pleasure is all mine, my boy,"" he said, and his gaze returned to the wood in his hands, which I could now see was a perfect, tiny seagull, wings poised for flight. ""You will enjoy yourself. Everyone is so very welcoming to our special guests.""

An hour later I stood in a room at the Mariner‚Äôs Rest. Martha was a woman with kind eyes and hands soft with dough and she showed me to a room with a bed dressed in a quilt of many colors and a window that looked out upon the sea. 

I used the guesthouse telephone and called the precinct and told O'Malley I was taking my days. He grumbled at the wire's other end and spoke a word about me going native and then he approved it.

I unpacked the few poor things I carried in my bag and I looked out from my window upon the island of Cormorant's Perch. The mist was breaking and thin shafts of a pale sun descended through the pines. 

Malachi was right. I had judged this place with a mainlander's prejudice. I had allowed the ravings of a troubled child to color the world with a darkness that was not there. 

The islanders were not monsters. They were people wedded to their rock and to their old and peculiar ways, and I had been given the chance to witness it. I had set my foot upon a new path and chose to believe it was a path of my own choosing.

I woke to the cries of gulls. At the insistence of Malachi I was not charged for my lodging or my meals. Old Martha set out before me a breakfast of smoked fish, bread and coffee. 

She moved about the kitchen with a solemn sort of care, her attentions not so much of kindness but as of some duty she was called to perform.

""The Harvest is a joyous time, Detective,"" she said, and her hand was steady as she refilled my cup. ""A time for us to give thanks for the blessings the sea provides us. It is wonderful to have a mainlander here to share in it with us. It's been so long since we've had a guest for the festival.""

After the meal I set out to walk the island. The paths were little more than lines scratched into the hide of the land, and they wound through a close press of pine and rock that was the island‚Äôs heart. 

For hours I saw no people, and heard nothing but the wind in the high branches and the sound of my own passage. I came at last to the cliffs at the southern edge of the land, a sheer escarpment where the land gave up its claim to the world. 

Far below the waves hammered at the rocks, a constant and violent toil. It was a place of a terrible beauty, and the water churned like a great gray millrace of the abyss.

Toward midday I turned back, and a smell drew me to the village, the smell of roasting meat and the far-off sound of some music. The place had come alive with a purpose. They were stringing ribbons of garish color from house to house, and in the center of the square a great pyre of wood was being raised. Trestle tables of raw timber were set out beside it, long as the feasting tables of old kings.

""A good day for a stroll, Detective,"" a man's voice called. He sat on an overturned lobster pot mending a net of deep blue color. I knew him from the docks.

""It certainly is,"" I replied, and walked toward him. ""Alex Harper.""

""Orrin,"" he said. He offered me his hand and the grip of it was hard. ""Pleased to have you with us for the Harvest. It's only right we show our mainland neighbors our truest selves once in a while.""

We sat and spoke for the better part of an hour while he worked. He told me stories of storms that had names like gods, and of the old feuds between the fishing families, and of strange fish that they pulled from the deep channels, things with no names on the mainland charts. 

His talk was filled with the island‚Äôs traditions, of the hunger of the sea and of the price of its bounty, and I listened as a man listens to the parables of a faith he does not share but finds compelling.

Later I saw a woman named Brenna. She sat weaving a great tapestry, and upon it were the figures of islanders in a boat heaving a great net from a black sea. In the net were other figures, things that had once been men, their limbs set at angles of profound distress. 

""It tells the story of the First Harvest,"" she explained, and her fingers never ceased their nimble and practiced dance. ""How our ancestors learned to receive the gifts from the deep, gifts that keep our people strong and hale through the cold winters."" She looked up and gave me a serene and beatific smile. ""Every festival, we welcome a traveler to share in the tradition, a custom passed down from the beginning, to honor the bond between the settled and the adrift.""

I looked at the grim tableau she was weaving and took it for their sacred history and a strange thing to celebrate with such an open heart.

That evening I ate with Martha and two old sailors whose flesh was too frail for the sea but whose eyes still held the look of it. Martha served a thick dark stew of roots I could not name and a meat she called only island game and would say no more of it. 

We drank a wine made from berries that grew on the rock, a thing of some potency, and it coursed in the blood like a warm and drowsy poison that smoothed the hard edges of the world. 

The warmth of these people, the welcome they offered up, it was a constant and disarming tide that pulled at the pilings of my own reason.

As I climbed the stair to my room the world seemed a simple place and all the sorrows of the mainland were a distant country. I lay in the dark and from the village came the slow and solemn beat of a drum, a sound like the beating of a great heart. 

It was the sound of a thing coming to pass, of a rite being prepared. I chose to hear in that sound a song of peace, and let the darkness take me.

The morning broke gray and doleful, and the day of the Harvest Festival arrived under a sky of leaden slate pulled low across the water. 

The wine of the night before had left a bitter sediment in my blood and I sought to clear my head with a walk along the shore before the ordained celebrations of the evening began. 

I chose a different path this time, a track that led toward a cove of which Orrin had spoken, a place of rocks and tide pools that the islanders called the Boneyard.

""It‚Äôs where the sea gives back what it has taken,"" he had said, and there was a knowing in his eye I had mistaken for charm. ""Whale bones, smoothed glass, shipwrecked timbers.""

The path was no path but a scar through the gorse that descended toward a crescent of black shingle where the sea foamed and fretted. The cove was a sepulcher of driftwood, a tangled ossuary of trees scoured and bleached to a bone whiteness by the salt and sun. 

I saw where the great rib of a leviathan broke from the sand like the arch of a ruined cathedral. I walked the tideline where the last wave had laid its lace of foam upon the shore. 

I was soothed by the solemn and rhythmic hammer of the waves, by the cold and absolute solitude of that place. I bent to the shingle to retrieve a stone worn smooth as a palmful of worry when I saw it.

It was a shard of unnatural whiteness protruding from the wet and sucking sand.

I knelt in the dampness and worked it free with my fingers from the cold earth. It was not a piece of shell nor of coral. It was the distal phalanx of a human finger. There was no mistaking its morbid and articulate perfection. 

A coldness that had no source in the sea air entered into me, a chill from some other and more terrible climate. 

I stood and made to hurl it back into the water, to give it to the sea‚Äôs forgetting, when I saw the glint of metal upon it. Corroded and green from its long slumber in the salt, a circle of baser metal, a cheap and simple wedding band, still clung to the bone.

My eyes quartered the beach with a new and terrible attention. They were no longer the eyes of a tourist but of a hunter, or of the hunted. And in that desolate place there was a new testament written in the debris, and I began to read.

Half-hidden in a great clot of rotting net cast high against the cliff was the shattered arch of a human mandible. It was yellowed with age, and a few teeth still clung to their sockets. Save for one, which held the dull gleam of an amalgam filling, a small testament of dentistry and a life lived on the other side of the water.

I took a step back from it, and my feet turned on the slick stones. The boy‚Äôs whisper returned to me, no longer a child‚Äôs fever dream but a truth spoken from the heart. *They eat people from the mainland.*

My gaze fell upon the driftwood piles with a dawning horror, and that which I had taken for the ribs of seals or porpoises I now saw with a new and awful clarity to be the staved-in architecture of a human cage. I saw a splintered femur that had been gnawed and broken. 

These were not skeletons. 

These were the leavings. 

This was the offal of a feast.

The friendly welcome of the Elder Malachi. The hearty parables of Orrin. The strange tapestry of Brenna the weaver with its figures pulled misshapen from the deep. The meat in Martha‚Äôs stew, a thing with no name but with a provenance I now understood.

All of it came together in my mind, a constellation of terror whose shape was now revealed. 

This was not a harvest of the sea. 

It was a harvest of men.

I turned from that place of bones and I ran. I clawed my way up the slick embankment, my hands gripping at the thorns of the gorse and at the wet and naked roots of trees as if they were the hands of saviors held out to me from the living world. 

I burst from the ravine‚Äôs edge and did not stop. I ran with the terror of a debased animal back to the false sanctuary of the Mariner‚Äôs Rest and a single thing was screaming in the meat of my brain. I must get off this island. 

I crashed through the guesthouse door and fled up the stairs. I slammed the door to my room and leaned my back against the wood.

My eyes scanned the small confines of my room. One door. One window that gave out onto the square. My training was not made for this. This was a heresy of the flesh, a pagan rite as old as the rocks it was enacted upon.

My radio. With hands that would not be still I retrieved it from my bag. I raised its small antenna and thumbed the switch and pressed it to my ear. There was no squawk of the dispatcher‚Äôs call. 

There was nothing. 

I turned the small black box over in my hands. And I saw it. At the base of the antenna the wire was severed. A clean and precise cut. Some careful artisan of my doom had been in my room. While Orrin filled my ears with his parables of the sea? While Martha set out her stews? While I had walked in my ignorance among the tombs of their making? 

I walked to the window and through a crack in the lace I looked down upon the square. The spectacle of the festival was nearly prepared. The pyre stood mountainous in the dusk. 

The islanders moved about their work with the grim and purposeful industry of acolytes at their devotions. The smiles I had taken for welcome I now saw as the ravenous and serene masks of predators. 

I saw Malachi directing the final preparations, a high priest in his element. As if he felt the weight of my gaze he looked up from his duties, and his eyes scanned the windows of the guesthouse. 

Our gazes met and held for a long second across that ordained space. He gave me a slow and placid nod. It was a benediction. It was a final and awful amen. For I was not the guest. I was the honored guest. I was the harvest.

I remained in that room while the last of the light bled out of the sky. My mind scrabbled at ways to escape. Swim to the mainland? I‚Äôd freeze to death. Steal one of their boats? The islanders‚Äô boats would be guarded as such upon this holy night. 

There was nothing but the clothing on my back. 

My only path forward was to play along.

I poured cold and dead water from the pitcher into the basin and put my face in it. In the clouded and weeping glass of the mirror I saw a ghost looking back. A pale face whose eyes held a terror I knew I must conceal behind some semblance of civility. 

I coached the pale man in the glass. ‚ÄúYou are just a visitor. You are eager for the festival.‚Äù

I descended the stair. Old Martha stood in the gloom of the lobby, polishing glasses. When she saw me she offered up a smile of such grotesque welcome that it was a thing of surpassing horror.

""Ah, Detective Harper! There you are!"" she said. ""I was beginning to worry you would sleep through the commencement feast! You must be hungry. Go on, join the others in the square. The fire will be lit soon. Find Malachi, he has saved you a seat of honor.""

I contrived a smile. ""Wouldn't miss it for the world, Martha.‚Äù

Outside the world had been remade by fire. Torches on high staves bled a guttering light onto the scene. The air was heavy with the sacramental odor of pine smoke and the rendering of fat from a massive pit near the fire. 

The islanders were gathered at long tables of rough hewn timber, drinking from wooden cups and laughing a laugh that was not a sound of mirth but of a ravenous and primal joy. A knot of men made music on fiddles and drums.

I moved through them.

Orrin clapped a hand on my shoulder. ""Almost time, Detective! You'll never see another night like this one!"" 

Brenna the weaver smiled at me from the depths of some beatific trance. All of it was an act, and I the guest, for whom this final act was prepared for.

I saw Malachi then. He stood like some ghastly pontiff at the head of the main table, a crown of dark ivy on his white hair. He motioned me toward him and I made my legs obey.

""Alexander, my boy!"" he boomed, gesturing to the seat beside him. ""I am so delighted you have joined us. I trust your day was‚Ä¶ illuminating?""

""Very scenic, yes,"" I managed.

""Excellent,"" he said. He turned and raised his cup and a sudden and profound silence fell upon that place. ""People of the Perch! We gather tonight for the sacred Harvest, as our forebears did, and their forebears before them! We thank the unending sea for the bounty it brings to our shores!""

A great and terrible baying rose from the assembly. 

""And we thank the drifting souls who find their way here,"" he continued, and his cold eyes found mine and held them. ""Who nourish our traditions and give of themselves so that our community may survive another year!""

The crowd roared, their faces a gallery of feverish and contorted masks in the firelight. They raised their cups to me. All of them. And Malachi turned to me and in the din his voice was a whisper of venom and benediction for me alone.

""It is a great honor you provide us, Detective Harper. The greatest honor we can bestow. You are now truly a part of our island story. Forever.""

Platters of rendered meat and steaming roots were passed down the long boards of the tables. One was set before me, a charnel bounty piled high upon the plate, and I could not look at it.

""First, you will eat with us,"" Malachi said, and his voice was of a silken and dreadful honey but with a subtext of iron. ""It is tradition that the guest partakes.""

They were going to wait until I was full and slow. I picked at the flesh with my fork and the ghastly ruse was the only thing between my life and the pyre that awaited it.

""Tell me, Malachi,"" I said, and I marveled at the steadiness of my own voice as it came forth from my throat. ""The ceremony itself. When does that happen? What am I to expect?""

His smile widened. ""Patience, my boy. After the feast comes the music, then the dance. A spiral dance, winding to the very center of the square. That is where we show our ultimate gratitude. At the foot of the fire, under the moon.""

My eyes quartered the square. The fire and the torches were the world‚Äôs only light, and beyond their bleeding circles lay the utter blackness of the cliffs and the docks. It was the only way out of that lit and holy hell.

Then came the dispensation for which I had not dared to pray. A man burdened with a roasted leg stumbled, and his platter crashed upon the earth with a wet and greasy clap. 

A momentary confusion took hold as men rushed to this small ruin, and their bodies formed a brief and chaotic screen between Malachi and myself.

My mind surrenders its claim and my body acted upon its own terrible ordinance. I shoved the great weight of the table and sent Malachi‚Äôs cup spilling its dark wine across his lap. He sputtered a curse. I was over the bench and into the shadows before the first cry went up.

""The guest is leaving!"" a woman shrieked. ""Don't let him reach the docks!""

The frantic music of the feast was strangled in an instant, and in its place there rose a bestial clamor and the percussion of heavy boots upon the hardpan. I ran as I had not run since I was a boy who feared ghosts in the dark, and now the ghosts were real and at my back. 

I ran through the warren of lanes and between the salt-eaten cottages and their knowledge of the place was offset by the pure and animal fury of my flight. I hid myself behind a stack of cordwood and held my breath as two fishermen passed, their faces limned with a righteous anger, and then I ran again toward the sound and the smell of the sea.

The docks. I broke from the last line of the houses and saw the harbor. A few boats sat tied fast in the black water, their familiar forms of no use to me. And then I saw it. Churning slow from the far pier was a light, and I heard the slow and steady systole and diastole of a diesel engine. It was a mainlander‚Äôs boat, a trawler hugging the dark shore.

It was my only hope. 

""There he is!"" A roar from the blackness behind me. 

A clot of men bearing torches broke from the village, and at their head was Orrin, his face raw, filled with the intent of murderous sacrament.

They would be on me before I could reach the pier. I did the only thing that was left to a man in my extremity. I scrambled down the rockface at the harbor‚Äôs edge, my hands shredded on the shells and the stone. 

I fell into the water and the shock of such lethal cold seized the very heart in my chest. And I swam. I put my head down and crawled through the black and frigid water, my strength a coin I spent with every stroke, my arms reaching for that single receding light.

The shouts at my back turned to curses, and then to silence. They did not follow. They were content to commend my soul to the sea‚Äôs cold ministry. The sea did its work. My limbs were things of lead and my lungs were filled with fire. 

And as the last of my strength left me, as I prepared to give myself to the deep, my flailing hand struck something hard and unyielding. 

The hull.

A rope ladder hung down its side. With my fingers I hooked them through the rungs and I pulled myself from the water and came to be on the scaly and reeking deck of the boat. 

I collapsed and drew air into my lungs in great ragged gasps as the lights of Cormorant's Perch, the lights of that ordained and hellish feast, dwindled to a fading constellation of malevolent light upon the black and endless waters. 

And I was alive.

The fisherman who pulled me from the black water looked upon me as if I were a shade dredged up from the seafloor, a thing not meant to return to the world of men. 

He gave me a blanket that reeked of fish and salt and the great and abiding rot of the ocean and pointed the nose of his trawler toward the mainland‚Äôs distant lights. 

I offered a broken telling of a boating accident and he did not question it, for the animal terror in my eyes was a testament older than any words.

In the clean and well lit rooms of the station house my story sounded like madness. They listened with the concern of men who hear a confession for a sin they cannot comprehend. 

I gave them my testimony. Finn‚Äôs whisper. The charnel ground of the cove. The sabotaged radio. My flight from that ordained feast. 

They sent a Coast Guard chopper to circle that rock. The report came back and said everything was normal. A fishing village. Quiet  people. There was no proof, for this evil was a thing that left no proof, only a profound and terrible absence.

Sergeant O‚ÄôMalley was a bull of a man whose faith was in the solidity of the world, and my story was a heresy against his church. 

""Hypothermia, exhaustion,"" he declared, his voice a sermon for the bullpen. ""Couple that with some of their home brewed poison and you hallucinated the whole damned thing, Harper. Get a grip."" 

For a week I sat in that purgatory of paperwork and every time I closed my eyes the world dissolved into the gray shingle of the cove and the pale and horrid glimmer of bone in the sand. 

Every shadow wore the face of Malachi, his smile a placid benediction upon my damnation. I was a man who had seen God's monstrous other half and they called me mad for it.

Then on a morning like any other the telephone on the main desk rang. I saw O‚ÄôMalley emerge from his office reading a slip of paper, and his face was a study in irritation. 

""Unbelievable,"" he said, and he stopped at my desk. ""Get this. Another domestic complaint from your precious island getaway.""

""Sir?"" I asked, and I rose from my chair though my legs were made of straw.

""Noise complaint. Boyfriend and a girlfriend this time, apparently. Some young couple named Thorne. Just moved over from the mainland six months ago looks like. Neighbor is reporting yelling, screaming. The whole nine yards. Standard procedure,"" he said, turning toward a rookie named Peterson, a boy so young his piety for the badge was still upon him. ""Peterson! You're up.""

The air went out of me. ""Sergeant, no,"" I said. ""No, sir, you can't.""

He turned back and his brows were a furrowed and angry line. 

""Can't what, Harper? Can't do my job? Can't send an officer to a simple public disturbance call?""

""You don't understand, sir. It's a lure. It's not a real dispute,"" I said, stepping toward him. 

""It's how they do it. It's how they get someone out there. First my call, now this one‚Ä¶ don't you see the pattern? You can't send him.""

""Detective, that is enough,"" he said. ""You have your own conspiracy theories, that's fine. Deal with them on your own time. But you will not interfere with police business based on some fever dream you had. Peterson is a capable officer. He doesn't carry your‚Ä¶ baggage."" He gave me a last look of dismissal. ""Now get back to your desk.""

He turned his back on me. The sentence was passed. I returned to my place and I watched as Peterson, young and doomed and eager to prove his worth, grabbed the keys to his patrol car. ""And Peterson,"" O‚ÄôMalley called out to him. ""It‚Äôs the Perch. No sidearm. Just keep the peace.""

The boy gave a nod full of a terrible and unknowing confidence. He cast a look of pity upon me as he passed, the sane man pitying the seer, and then he walked out into the light of the day.

That was three days ago. Peterson never activated his radio. The rock has gone mute out there in the gray expanse of the water. He has not come back. 

And I know with a dreadful and certain gnosis that he never will. 

The great and terrible wheel has turned, the old blood sacrifice is paid, and the harvest is come again. 

And I who had seen the awful workings of the oracle was now just another soul damned to watch it happen.",3,1751307014.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Seeing each other/going out around 4 months. 

After 1.5 months/2 months I tried to define the relationship, talked about boundaries and things I wouldn‚Äôt like in a partner. One of my questions was like do you still talk with exs or people you‚Äôve slept with before? If they wrote to you how would you respond.

She said she doesn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt even reply, I thought great we are on the same page.


A couple of weeks later she told me about her ex sliding in her dms after liking her story. He said sorry didn‚Äôt mean to or something like that, she was like your all good no worries and then he said like enjoy your night and she didn‚Äôt respond after that. 

It was early days when it happened, we didn‚Äôt have the DTR conversation etc so not much I can do here but remember this event. Told me a month or so after it happened so it was after the talk etc. EDIT: So event happened before DTR but only told me about it after we DTR


She has 4 guy friends that she would talk to on instagram etc, lived abroad with them in the same house for random periods of time, worked together etc over the span of 6 years. One or two of them are more prominent than the others. Pretty much daily texts about life, memes etc (according to her I haven‚Äôt seen) one of them gets a weekly phone call. They all live in the other side of the world so it‚Äôs a bit weird to me and uncomfortable.


I got a hunch and asked if she‚Äôd ever slept with these 4 people before. She said she did and She had previously slept with 3 of them one time (separately) and the other two times. (To be clear, Not all at once)

I was a bit taken back by this because of our DTR talk, she said she didn‚Äôt even think of them because it was 5 years ago and they are just all great friends now, she met their subsequent gfs since and all that. But that wasn‚Äôt nice for me. I don‚Äôt know if there gfs even know.

Then there was this other random guy I‚Äôve never heard of until about two weeks ago. Worked together when they were teenagers for 3 years, he wants to meet for a coffee, I asked if there was history, she said no not at all. Just good friends. She has never met his previous or new gfs either. (I don‚Äôt know if I believe there is no history, what are the odds out of 5 guy friends she only slept with 4)

Another thing I noticed is that she was always weird with her phone, notifications completely privatised even when the phone was unlocked. (Been like this since the day I met her) I‚Äôve noticed it a lot but since all this came out I decided to ask. She said she was afraid of a random guy writing to her e.g a story response and that‚Äôs why she reads the notifications in private because she would be embarrassed and think I might get quiet. I always said there‚Äôs nothing you can do about other people contacting you, it‚Äôs how you chose to respond.

She then went to the bathroom and blocked some random guy we didn‚Äôt talk about, I said that is weird, show me why you blocked him, I seen no messages or responses back from her but just that she opened one time images from him on instagram 6/7 times while we were together. He‚Äôs a serial photo sender, I‚Äôve heard about it him before and he does it to everyone, don‚Äôt know why she chose that moment to block him but she would never respond to him. I think she said he was the reason why she didn‚Äôt want to check in front of me because it could be anything, she was meaning to block him months ago but Just forgot.


All this happened and I was really anxious and on edge so I asked about the guy from before we DTR in the DMs, her ex. I asked her do you still have the DMs, she was like yes, went to check and they were deleted.

I‚Äôm at a total loss, I am madly in love with this person and but right now I feel like an idiot. 

I asked why, she didn‚Äôt remember because he removed her as a follower etc but she thinks it was cause she didn‚Äôt want to see his face in the DMs. Why delete that and not the guy she blocked in my bathroom. I don‚Äôt even know when these were deleted. 

I am so confused, I feel she loves me too but it‚Äôs hard for me to understand while I‚Äôm so emotionally invested. She‚Äôs trying now, phone is a bit more open and not as Fort Knox but I don‚Äôt know if the damage is done or is she just going to get better at hiding stuff.

''Nice'', I think to myself. ''Spinello decided to start a bit later today!''. I jump out of my twin size bed, shoved into the corner of my 50 square foot bedroom, and make my way to the bathroom to get myself together. I turn on the shower, and notice that the color of the water is coffee brown. ''Ah, this is an improvement'', I think to myself. ''At least it doesn't smell like excrement today!''

I rush down five flights of stairs, open my front door and am blasted by the 95 degree heat at 7:30AM, and the scent of sewage, mixed with marijuana. ''Awesome, at least I love the smell of weed!'' I think to myself.

Making my way down Newark Ave, I notice a few people sleeping on benches. One is actively defecating behind the stage in front of Barcade. ''Well, at least its only one person openly taking a crap today'', I think to myself.

Entering the Path station at Grove, street, the temperature rises to around 110 degrees. There are rats on the platform, and there are delays of 45 mins in all directions. ''At least its not an hour!'' I think to myself. The train never came, so I needed to get a $95 uber in order to get to work.

After work, the PATH is still not operating due to police activity, so I take a $87 uber home. I arrive home at 9:50PM, the apartment is sweltering because the air conditioner failed while I was gone. I think to myself, ''Damn, I brought this on myself. I'm only paying $5,000 for this apartment, I should have gone for the nicer one that was $7,500..it would have not happened there!''

At 9:51 I realize I only have 9 minutes to get to the liquor store, so I run to the liquor store to buy my $30 4-pack of mediocre beer. I also buy two $9 slices of pizza, which is such a great deal!While walking home, I step in shit. Not sure if it's human or dog, but ''at least it only happened to me once today'' I think to myself.

Finally, back at my sweltering apartment, my neighbors next door are fighting on one side, and on the other side the neighbor who has 4 dogs is throwing bones on the floor and the dogs are running all around, barking, and making lots of noise. ''Cute!'' I think to myself, ''I love people who collect dogs like toys and coop them up in urban settings.''

I drink my beers, eat my pizza and get in bed around 2:15 AM. As I lay my head on my pillow, I hear a few 'POP POP POP'' sounds outside, followed by sirens. ''It's just fireworks, Jersey City is so safe!'' I think to myself.

My narcotic strength sleep aid kicks in, and before passing out I think to myself ''Man, I'm really living the dream. This is what people all over the world want, and I have it. I'm one of the lucky ones!''",0,1751306867.0,jerseycity,5,0.38,False

I saw you mention being in 4-5 group chats now. You invited others. But not me. And that‚Äôs okay ‚Äî I get it. We grew distant. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt someone you wanted to share that part of your world with anymore.

But then you said it.
‚ÄúHe is added here too.‚Äù
And that hit different.
Because you‚Äôre the one who added me to that group. You made that space feel like somewhere I belonged once. And now? You act surprised to see me. Like I wasn‚Äôt part of that life. Like I‚Äôm the stranger in the room you built.

Still‚Ä¶ when you sent that cold coffee photo, it made me smile. It made me feel.
You still drink it the same way.
And I swear, for a moment, I imagined it ‚Äî just being there, you handing it to me, maybe teasing me for how much sugar I‚Äôd add to mine.
That moment‚Ä¶ felt real. Until I remembered I‚Äôm just ‚Äúhim‚Äù now.
Just ‚ÄúD.‚Äù
Not the one who stayed up with you. Not the one who helped with your homework‚Äôs and assignments. Not the one who whispered, ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt ever leave,‚Äù because I thought you‚Äôd never break that promise.

I treated you like a queen. Always.
Forget love for a second ‚Äî I treated you with respect.
I didn‚Äôt blow up your phone. I didn‚Äôt call without asking.
I always asked. I always made sure you were okay first.
You tell people they can call you anytime. But I still asked. Every single time. Because I cared. And maybe‚Ä¶ because I feared crossing a line.

That‚Äôs what hurts the most ‚Äî I opened up to you.
You know I don‚Äôt do that easily.
But with you, I dropped all my walls. You saw the softest parts of me ‚Äî the messy, honest, unsure parts.
And you left.

And now? I‚Äôm split in half.
Half of me still loves you. Deeply. Quietly. Endlessly.
And the other half‚Ä¶ is angry. Resentful. Not because I hate you, but because I don‚Äôt understand how someone who meant so much could act like I meant so little.

I still think about when we first met.
You felt older. Wiser. Collected.
I was the mess ‚Äî the soft-hearted, blushy guy who caught feelings before he could blink.
You warned me. You told me not to fall.
But I did. And now I‚Äôm here.
Picking through the ashes of moments I still treasure.
And I‚Äôll always treasure them ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre here or not.

The way we used to fight like we were in a drama but make up like we couldn‚Äôt stand the silence.
The way I begged you to never leave.
I told you that was my dealbreaker.
And still‚Ä¶ you did.

We‚Äôve come so far, haven‚Äôt we? From late-night voice notes and laughter to this ‚Äî me writing into the void.
Things have changed.
But I don‚Äôt like this version of us.

Actually‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know if ‚Äúus‚Äù exists anymore.",0,1751306836.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.5,False

1loenb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1loenb9/exposure_to_neurotypical_children_or/,Exposure to neurotypical children or neurodivergent play dates ?,"Long story short, my little one just turned four. We live at a safe street where kids play outside. Lately he wants to play outside ALL the time. Some of the kids tolerate his behaviour (not sharing toys, not being able to follow rules of group games, some mild stimming etc). Some other kids find it odd and they are being sometimes nasty to him (ignoring him, or making hurtful comments ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not coming to my party‚Äù ). I have to supervise him closely when he is outside and I‚Äôm constantly on edge. Other parents just chill and wash their cars or cut the grass whilst supervising and I‚Äôm constantly following the kids around not being able to focus on any adult conversations. Sometimes I‚Äôm trying so hard to include him in games ending up playing myself with a bunch of kids. Sometimes I‚Äôd feel they only tolerate him because they enjoy having an adult play with them. I sadly feel if it weren‚Äôt for my presence they wouldn‚Äôt even acknowledge him let alone play with him. 
Until the day we had our first play date with a neurodivergent child from his class. They were both genuinely happy running around doing their thing, laughing, hugging, doing random stuff. No judging, no fighting, no inappropriate comments. Their games did not make sense to neurotypical people for example they were throwing toys on the lawn and laughing with the way they were landing. I was able to enjoy my cup of coffee while chatting with the boys mum for non kid related stuff. It was refreshing, safe, familiar. 
My question is : I thought exposing my child to neurotypical children would make him eventually pick up behaviours even for the sake of masking. Waiting for his turn, share, follow game rules, advance his motor skills, negotiate.  But we both end up heartbroken. He cannot grasp why some kids are mean to him and I beat myself with comparison even jealousy sometimes. Should I insist with socialising with neurotypical kids or increase the amount of time he spends with neurodivergent children? ",1,1751306779.0,Autism_Parenting,0,1.0,False

The problem is that she moved out about a year and a half ago,  and even when she did live by me we've only spoken a few times in the stairwell but never more than small talk. I thought about it back then but never had the courage or opportunity plus I was dealing with some things.

Since then I'm 90% sure I've seen her in the streets and coffee shops here and there. One time I saw her and said hi but that was like a year ago. The only indication that she might be even slightly interested is because a few months ago she sent me a facebook friend request out of the blue,  which put the thought in my minde but again we barley spoke so I never did it.

Im wondering if it's too late and no matter what I write I feel like I'll come off as a creep, plus I'm not doing great in the app world at the moment so I definitely feel like I'm reaching for straws and acting out of desperation.

I‚Äôm making my first Lion‚Äôs Mane tincture, aiming for both cognitive benefits (focus, memory) and general wellness. I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback or corrections from those more experienced.

#  Here‚Äôs What I Did So Far:

* **Mushroom type:** 100g dried Lions Mane
* **Preparation:** Cut into small pieces with sterilized scissors
* **Jar:** 1L glass jar, disinfected with alcohol and vinegar
* **Alcohol:** 50cl (500ml) of **50% ABV whiskey**
* **Sinker method:** Cut a **stainless steel strainer** to hold mushrooms submerged
* **Lid:** Stainless steel, disinfected
* **Storage:** Cool, dark place (planning 4‚Äì6 weeks)
* **Tools:** Planning to use **glass dropper**, **coffee filter**, and **syringe** to extract final tincture

# My Questions:

1. Am I using the right alcohol strength for optimal extraction of alcohol-soluble compounds (hericenones, erinacines)?
2. Is 4‚Äì6 weeks steeping time enough ‚Äî or too long?
3. Any other advice for preserving potency and avoiding contamination?

I will be contacting the OP's from previous posts and compiling a list of of things, if I find out anything worthwhile, I'll make sure to include it here in the post. Thank you all for your attention, and happy hunting!",1,1751306304.0,mycology,0,1.0,False

Psychoactive drugs: substances that affect brain function and alter mood, perception, consciousness, or behaviour. 
Examples: stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, opioids

I used caffeine for years to uphold my energy and mood, until I couldn‚Äôt drink it anymore. 

It‚Äôs important to recognize that while it has many great effects, it can also exacerbate symptoms like delusion and paranoia. 

Intention for the stimulant is important, otherwise you can end up hyperfixating (even subconsciously) on things you don‚Äôt want to, and sometimes you don‚Äôt even notice this is happening. Especially if you drink coffee every day.

I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Renters/comments/1k63vb1/being_charged_a_convenience_fee_for_paying_rent/?share_id=-lS5D3fIM-Ke9G1qXt_v3) from a few months ago, but wanted to follow up as there seemed to be loose ends there.

Our situation is also slightly different in that there is _no_ way for us to avoid a fee: even paying via bank transfer (presumably ACH?) would cost us $2.49 on top of our rent.

Now, sure, it's less than a cup of coffee, but the principle of the thing matters.

Are we right to push back against our landlord for this? What recourse do we have in MA to pay our rent without having to eat these fees?

1loee20,https://i.redd.it/rd8fmrwhs3af1.jpeg,Alternate Layout or Furniture for Family/Living Room?,"A relative would like thoughts on alternate  ways of arranging their family room (roughly 14 x 17 feet).

The room has a fireplace at one end flanked by bookcases/cabinets (not built-in), and a window/sliding door to a sunroom on the north wall. Current furniture arrangement is in the image; here's what they like:

- plenty of seating and space for a large TV at an appropriate distance and height; previous owners had their TV in the upper left corner. TV above fireplace isn't an option; the mantel is too high. They don't mind having the TV opposite the sliding doors, since those face north and the light's not strong enough to interfere with visibility 

- general symmetry where loveseat is in the same line as the coffee table and fireplace, and the couch is in the same line as the sliding doors, coffee table, and TV

Things they don't like:

- bit of a closed off feel; when guests visit it can feel a little cramped surrounding the coffee table. Maybe they're just trying to fit too much in a small space

- not much of path to access the sliding doors behind the couch; it's doable but a bit of a squeeze. The armchair in the lower left blocks off the bookcase and has to be moved for access

- feels like there are a lot of little pieces of furniture, and they'd like a more streamlined look

They're not super attached to any of the furniture and can move pieces elsewhere in the house, and they're fine getting new items like a sectional or chaise if it makes more sense. Thanks for any suggestions you might have! ",2,1751306205.0,floorplan,0,1.0,False

1. **Yashasvi Jaiswal‚Äôs NOC Drama: The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Going to Goa‚Äù Show**  
   Mumbai‚Äôs favorite cricketer, Yashasvi Jaiswal, has officially decided to stick with his hometown team after a melodramatic NOC withdrawal saga. Initially, he tried to flee to Goa for ""family plans"" (read: midlife crisis), but now he‚Äôs back, penning a heartfelt letter to the Mumbai Cricket Association: *‚ÄúI sincerely request MCA to allow me to play for Mumbai this season!‚Äù* The MCA, ever the supportive parents, replied, *‚ÄúOf course, Yashasvi! You‚Äôre our pride, our joy, and our excuse to flex about our cricketers on Instagram.‚Äù* Meanwhile, the Dr. HD Kanga League is resurrecting its original format‚Äîprobably because the new one involved too many goats.  

2. **Wimbledon‚Äôs War on Sandwiches**  
   Wimbledon banned a fan-favorite food (spoiler: it‚Äôs probably the ‚Äústrawberry and cream sandwich‚Äù) due to ‚Äúenvironmental concerns.‚Äù Because nothing says ‚Äúeco-friendly‚Äù like making tennis fans suffer through a menu of kale smoothies and guilt. Meanwhile, Inter Miami‚Äôs Lionel Messi got a consolation prize after a Club World Cup loss: a participation trophy and a LinkedIn post.  

3. **NBA‚Äôs ‚ÄúLeBron‚Äôs Midlife Crisis‚Äù Special**  
   LeBron James is staying with the Lakers but hinting at dissatisfaction like a teenager eyeing the door during family dinner. The NBA is speculating if this is a prelude to a trade request (unlikely, since he has a no-trade clause and a no-trade personality). Sources say he and the Lakers haven‚Äôt discussed contract extensions‚Äîprobably because LeBron‚Äôs camp said, *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not discounting our product, even if it‚Äôs been 20 years and your knees are shot.‚Äù*  

4. **Nigeria‚Äôs Olympic Day: Rain, Fitness, and a Motivational Speech**  
   Nigerians celebrated International Olympic Day with rain-soaked enthusiasm in Lagos, proving that nothing deters a nation from fitness except a downpour. Engr. Habu Gumel, Nigeria‚Äôs Olympic Committee president, urged everyone to embrace fitness for ‚Äúmind and body,‚Äù adding, *‚ÄúSports transcend geopolitical boundaries!‚Äù* Because nothing unites humanity like a shared love of sweating through a rainstorm while pretending to care about the Olympics.  

In other news: Paul Pogba returned to football after an 18-month doping ban‚Äîprobably to prove he can still dance in a red card. Ruud Gullit is now a concerned parent of Chelsea‚Äôs roster, and Wimbledon‚Äôs menu is now as exciting as a tax audit.

There was a wildfire about 200 feet from our house. I was on my way home back from visiting family when my husband called saying that fire is getting closer and officers were blocking the streets. I was still about an hour 30 away. I tried my hardest to not drive reckless, I felt this pull in my chest and voice to relax and be patient. 

Once I get a block away my house there was tons of bystanders so I jumped out the car thankfully my mom was with me and she then drove. I started running as fast as I could in chanclas then I turn the corner and there was huge flames right across from us..maybe like four cars away. 

Less than an hour later they are yelling at us to evacuate NOW We kinda freak out, thankful we had our go bags because living in SoCal. But we were NOT prepared for music gear. 

My husband is a musician and had a gig later that night so we needed to save his drum kit OH and we have 4 dogs and 3 tortoises. 

So there was no space in our car so we freaked out. Grateful that the officers allowed my mom to cross to help us. We rush to pack my mom‚Äôs car with the drums and tortoises. I made sure to grab the go bags and I packed Santa Muerte. From her statues, jewelry, and owls. My Nina came and was on the other side of the block. She took our dogs. Lastly, we drove to my mom‚Äôs house. 

When we get there I check on Santa Muerte and her scythe is broken. Immediately I felt this relief. Didn‚Äôt even release how tense I was till that moment. Felt this weight lifted. Then I heard ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be back‚Äù Hours later the evacuation order is lifted and fire was stopped maybe about 2/3 cars away from our home. 

Woke up this morning, walked out side, and saw the torched black field. It was a sadly beautiful view. I started to tear up and wanted to fall to my knees in awe of Her. 

I am absolutely grateful for your protection. This isn‚Äôt the first time something like this has happened. I will forever be devoted to you in physical, spiritual, and in the void. I‚Äôm going to put your scythe back together just how you have done for me in the past. Thank you for allowing me to be a devotee of yours.

The living room TV shows him stuff he'd rather not see. If you'd rather listen than read,* [I recorded it, too](https://www.breakupgamingsociety.com/blog/dwelling-solo-rpg-journaling-session-two-living-room-tv-scene)*. Thanks for checking it out!*

**LIVING ROOM**

Scene-Setting: ‚ÄúThe living room is dimly lit by the glow from the streetlights and moon filtering into the room. I start to walk through the room, but with each step, my legs feel shaky, like they‚Äôre no longer as sure in the knees as they usually are.‚Äù

The shift in scent is utter, it‚Äôs her curated mix of all the bright and fussy cans and bottles you‚Äôd see in advertisements with white backgrounds like rock videos, plus the sum of her mom‚Äôs house dust and what she cooked. It is like a cannonball of beach coconut, steam and gravies, candy-flower room deodorizers. I am felled.

I am still on the floor when an arm reaches out from the shadows on the couch end and pats the middle cushion: *Come sit by me*. I go where I am bidden. I gape at her as she forms, legs tucked in at the end of the couch, hair bound in back, working her cuticles. She could vanish into those for an afternoon, so absolute that I wasn‚Äôt sure which one of us had disappeared.

The scent-envelope lasts about as long as an FM summer hit. The harder I peer, the quicker the scent weakens, and her outline with it. There‚Äôs just a small depression in the cushion left when the TV comes on. The chunky green numbers don‚Äôt match the style of what I know J‚Äôs TV to display. His TV is old, but not as old as these green numbers.

**Channel 84:** The blond wood coffee table with the oval frame that had a hollow for magazines that you could see through the inline glass panels at either end. That should have tipped me off. 

Skinny kid with brown eyes and cropped hair, underweight at about six feet, cap with some kind of golf resort logo parked on the back of his head. He‚Äôs side-lit from the sliding glass door by a summer sun‚Äôs mid-afternoon arson, its smoke a colossal column of boredom that breeds the legion of usual aches. You can beat the first ache with lunch, the second with masturbation, but they multiply regardless. He lifts the needle on a record player on a shelf behind him. The bookshelf matches the coffee table.

It‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù by 7 Seconds, their love song, last track on *The Crew* from 1984. He can never pick which part he‚Äôs air banding, he switches between bass, guitar, drums and vocals several times. It‚Äôs just 2:17 long.

He cues it up again. This mope is tireless. On the third play I recognize it‚Äôs me and I watch the fourth and fifth play through my fingers, sick with shame. The scene isn‚Äôt supposed to be lit like this, the world outside so bleached with light that dusk doesn‚Äôt seem possible even though there was one just the day before. It was lit by footlights in a small music club. When the chorus hit I‚Äôd look down ‚Äî I‚Äôd have to be on bass or guitar for this one ‚Äî and see her in the front row. Somehow it mattered that my band had booked the gig and I hadn‚Äôt known she‚Äôd be there.

That poor over-freighted melody. The sentiment of the lyrics was all stolen, they were show-home staging tricks. The idea was always the melody that would corkscrew us inside each other. It‚Äôs always the melody. Hijacking that was the false voice that you think will make you understood at 17. Because you still wouldn‚Äôt know what to say to her or do with her before or after the song.

I just wanted her to call me once that summer, I wasn‚Äôt even excited about going to college.

**Channel 130-142:** I recognize myself immediately this time.

Good God Almighty, I even dreamed myself up an eye patch in this one, pulling up next to her at a stoplight on one of those night-cooled four-laners with landscaped medians that connect master-planned stretches of this and that. What would be playing. Maybe Funkdoobiest if I wanted it dangerous and cavalier, Ned‚Äôs Atomic Dustbin if I wanted to instill uptempo regret in her. In Version One I‚Äôd turn slowly from behind the wheel of my astonishing vehicle and regard her with dead eyes, because what do you do for vindication except stare at them from a distance greater than the span of their retreat, one-up them for scars, accomplishments and mystery? Streak like metal and liquid across the dome of their dream world like they did yours.

In Version Two on Channel 131 she has girlfriends in the car to witness what a dreary plane she‚Äôd confined herself to when she let me go; they gawk as I light a cigarette just before the green light and the hookiest part of the sample hits and *vroom,* that‚Äôs that. The channels advance faster. Apparently I devised a whole career‚Äôs worth of these.

Oh look, now I‚Äôm in a track suit with bodyguards in a resort town where she happens to be staying with her family, again with the eye patch, not very imaginative to keep replicating that touch. The channels keep flipping through one tawdry *coup de th√©√¢tre* after another, all shows of strength and indifference, you‚Äôd think this I could have worked a rescue or two in there. I feel sick, but I stay on the couch.

**Channel 187**: I look like I‚Äôm in my late 20s now in the pool hall. It‚Äôs a well-appointed one: The regulation tables have beautiful felt, the rails are lustrous, the lights are even and the rafters high. I‚Äôm overdressed for Denver as usual.

Her cousin is there with her boyfriend and there is a lot of laughter. Nobody besides me gets too invested in their turn during our doubles game. Those couples‚Äô games would stretch, the last seven balls invincible. We‚Äôd try to coach, but it would be seven balls perpetually because the girls weren‚Äôt that interested and the boys were too drunk.

The pool hall is crowded, young professional kids on a Friday night and there seems to be a lot of people we don‚Äôt know forming a gallery around our table. What is it with these onlookers? They‚Äôre almost all men, a cluster of ectomorphs.

Then I notice Bryce is there, looking at ease, he‚Äôll be the one on her arm at her little sister‚Äôs wedding, ropy and tan as a lifeguard. There‚Äôs Andrew, for whom she jilted me before Bryce. Gentle Karl is there in a tartan driving cap and his long, brown hair. 

I sink the 10 ball with a beautiful cut that rockets it neatly to a corner, magnetized to the cushion for what looks like a gymnasium‚Äôs length. I leave the 20 oz. cue on the table and walk away unnoticed.

**Channel 102:** That same pulverizing sun except it lights the respiratory junk of the desert gambling tower roofs and the awful concrete that boils and the cars are its lava. Drawing the thick inner shades, it‚Äôs 10 a.m. At some point the rolling chatter of the machines turned into the choir of Mammon as the night we had T-boned the oncoming morning.

*Please stay here with me.*

What is sold to you as fun under the dead sun and the concrete. She is as calm as a cultist. There‚Äôs no need for a fight because there‚Äôs nothing to fight about, she is going to walk right back into the heart of that thing that whispers in the spaces between $1 coins hitting the metal troughs; throbs behind the lit ad panels, their jumbo lobsters and necropolis summers; gurgles beneath the green water that conjures the free 11:15 show up out of the synthetic lagoon.

*Please stay here with me.* It‚Äôs been all night, I just want to clasp her under the sheets and drift off together. It‚Äôs very important, but her smile is fixed for sacrifice.

She goes out the door and into the hall of the 15th floor to find the elevator down.

I can‚Äôt leave the room. I should be hungry. I‚Äôm not looking out the window or watching TV, that‚Äôs just another window, except worse.

The TV turns off. There‚Äôs a trace of artificial berry lip balm and cigarette smoke on my mouth.

Step 4: I text you the next day, apologising for the abrupt exit and promise to give you a cheesecake as a token of apology. You are still angry but agree to give me a chance

1loe2v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkFantasy/comments/1loe2v2/perfect_sculpture/,Perfect sculpture,"My collarbone tore through the skin with a wet snap. It wasn't painful, at least not the kind of pain that makes you scream. It was an exquisite pang, one fiber detaching from another, teeth sinking into a tendon, the joint of a chicken bone. Warm blood welled up, but all I saw was the outline of a new geometry emerging from my flesh, an angle that wasn't there before, proof that I was progressing.

There were weeks when my body was a puzzle in constant redefinition. Like that time, as a child, cold water filled my bladder to the point of asphyxiation, yet my collarbones protruded, and in the mirror, they were perfect daggers, perfect bones. Or when the scarf dug into my waist night after night, the biting pain was the promise of a shape that wouldn't have existed before if I hadn't exerted the right, cutting pressure on that area.

Now, with more years accumulated, the war had escalated. It was no longer just a matter of centimeters or bone beneath the skin. It was liberation. My organs felt like alien entities, prisoners clamoring to escape the confines of my flesh, wanting to do as they pleased. My throat was the hardest, raw and open from so much forcing it to yield, corroded by acid, by countless objects partially inserted. Like that time my palate split open from trying to insert without removing my rings, letting me taste the rusty, metallic flavor of my war. My sunken, vigilant eyes saw the purity of my act, of the transformation; it was the language my body understood to achieve perfection, glorious perfection.

My phone alarm blared at 4 AM. I got out of bed as always, ignoring the creaking of my knees like dry firewood or the dull ache in my ribs. In the bathroom, under the fluorescent light of the mirror, I undressed. My only complaint was that my ribs couldn‚Äôt withstand the pressure of my old scarf‚Äôs knot as they once had; I supposed it was due to the years passing and my spine‚Äôs increasing resemblance to a question mark. The dark circles under my eyes were a side effect of sleepless nights, of my self-imposed vigil. Well, nothing a little concealer couldn‚Äôt fix; I loved chemical advancements that allowed me to build whatever mask I desired each morning. My vertebrae were beautiful, I‚Äôd thought so for a long time, though now that I look, they might have a strange shape‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt look like pointillism, like an escalator to heaven; they look more like wooden steps from a children‚Äôs game.

My routine could be called a cold liturgy. After masking my face, I went to the scale. The number that appeared was my only truth, my daily creed. I looked at my hands that morning. They had always been an offense, a betrayal of the fragility I had to display. I used to massage them, pressing hard, wishing the bone would emerge, that the skin would yield, that those 'baby hands' I hated so much would give way to the sharp delicacy I longed for. I looked at my thighs and smiled. They used to rub together all the time, another affront. I could feel the heat of the friction between them, the evidence of a mass that had to disappear. At night, after the world slept, my exercise routine was the only thing I knew. Hundreds of sit-ups, until the muscles of a 12-year-old girl tore. It wasn't exercise; it was self-sculpting, and it had certainly worked. I was very grateful to my past Laura for that.

I brewed my black coffee. On the kitchen counter was a plate full of food covered with plastic wrap. I approached the plate, removing the protective covering; a cheese and mushroom omelet, a croissant, some blueberries, and a bowl of cooked oatmeal. This was the regular breakfast my mother prepared for me. Back then, I was sooo creative. I remember that while I ate breakfast, my mother would get ready for her day. That was the perfect time to pull out one of the bags I kept under my mattress and in which I could dump that rich breakfast. Then I would sneak into the bathroom and empty its contents into the toilet. Now, well, I was very glad I no longer had to create all that paraphernalia. I took the breakfast, photographed it, added the New York filter from Instagram with the caption: 'Nothing like mom's food.' Then, into the trash bin; I had to take the bag to the deposit; it was already full.

On my way to the office, I remembered how I used to be and how much I had improved, thanks to my mother's breakfast, I suppose. Expulsion was an art I had perfected. I enjoyed, with cruel satisfaction, when I got tonsillitis or laryngitis. The inflammation made it almost impossible to swallow solids, and my mother would force me onto a liquid diet. Blessed infections! Liquids were so easy to eliminate, definitely a blessing. My body, though aching, felt lighter, purer. But it wasn't always so clean. Sometimes, haste or tiredness made me less careful. Like that time, when using the tip of my toothbrush too forcefully, I felt my soft palate perforate. A lot of blood came out, a crimson trickle I didn't know how to stop, so I stole some of Mom's cotton, rolled it, and pushed it to the back, feeling the sticky flow and metallic taste.

Then, diarrhea. A more efficient method, I'd researched. Poorly cooked or expired foods were my new Eucharist. On the scale, the numbers dropped faster than with just vomiting. But they came with a punishment: saline solution. That insidious liquid that promised to 'replenish' me and, to me, contaminate me. I took it, for mom's sake, and then rushed to the bathroom to purge it. That was the era of my greatest decline, my greatest triumph. But you couldn't have diarrhea all year, could you? I smiled remembering it.

At my desk, I tried to dodge my colleagues' glances while offering them a beautiful, toothy, gum-filled smile. Lately, a group from my floor would approach, inviting me to lunch, to share their food. I always declined with a distant attempt at kindness. The last time I accepted one of those invitations, I had to fake a stomachache to retreat to the restaurant bathroom. I vomited some into the sink, but had to use one of the pens from my blouse pocket. I didn‚Äôt notice the pen cap, cutting my upper gum. I felt my mouth fill with gastric juice and a wire-like taste once more. A customer entered the bathroom, saw my grimace of bloody teeth and undigested food bits. He ran out, and I never stepped foot in that place again.

That same night, back in my apartment, darkness was a comfort. My own skin, stretched over my skeleton like old parchment, felt the cold of solitude. Adult life is like this, at least mine, and I had no time during the day, so I sometimes dedicated my nights to making a few repairs. I had to change a lightbulb that hadn‚Äôt worked for a few days, the one in the kitchen. I climbed onto the small folding stool. My legs, thin as reeds, barely trembled. As I reached for the dead bulb, applying minimal pressure to unscrew it, I felt a sharp, fine tug. It wasn't a muscle; it was the sound of something tearing from deep within, fabric ripping not cleanly, but with the brutality of open flesh.

A wet crack, like a rotten branch snapping underfoot, echoed in the kitchen's silence. I felt a sudden, sticky warmth soak my armpit. I looked down. The bone of my humerus, the long bone of my arm, was out of place. It had dislocated with astonishing violence, and its tip, sharp as a knife, had perforated the skin from within. A gush of dark, dense blood, almost black in the gloom, pulsed out, not dripping, but surging with the beat of my racing heart, soaking my shirt.

The light from the bulb, now dangling from a wire, cast grotesque shadows. My arm bent at an impossible angle, the whitish, blood-stained bone protruding. The muscle fibers, sparse and thin, looked like broken threads. A cold sweat covered my forehead. I tried to move, to get off the stool, but my knees, those that creaked like dry firewood in the mornings, gave way completely. This time, there wasn't a dull crunch, but a blast that reverberated through the room. I felt a searing pain. My legs bent backward, my knees pointing the opposite way nature dictated, leaving only a mass of flaccid, deformed flesh and another dark pool of blood rapidly forming beneath me.

I fell to the floor, my body now a pile of torn flesh and exposed, sharp bones. The metallic, rusty smell of my blood filled the kitchen air, mixed with a sweet, nauseating stench of freshly killed animal. The darkness was total, save for the faint hallway light that filtered the broken silhouette of my arm and the deformed mass of my legs. I didn't know where everything was, but I could see the triangle formed by my broken arm along with my torso. My legs were splayed apart, each to its own side. I could see my left femur bone separated in a 1/4 proportion, with 1 being what remained attached to my knee and 4 what remained attached to my hip. My other leg, also broken, had no stabbed tissue; my broken bones hadn't been able to cut through the thick skin of my right leg. But I could see how my knee was bruising, beginning to take the shape of a newborn's head. I could see it clearly, as my right leg had landed beneath my torso when I fell. If it hadn't broken until now, I think the impact had increased the probability. I didn't faint after that; consciousness clung to me with tooth and nail, forcing me to witness the atrocity of my own destruction. This was not the progress or purity I had sought.

I felt desolate, rage piercing my chest. Bitter tears mingled with the sweat and blood on my face. I cried, not from physical pain, not from the mountain of flesh I was now, but from the monstrous injustice. Fifteen years, fifteen damn years, from eleven to twenty-six, sculpting every centimeter, every gram. I had been at heaven's gates, brushing with my fingertips the perfection, that ethereal, almost weightless figure I had built bone by bone. And now, my beautiful masterpiece, my sanctuary, my victory, was a pile of crimson rubble, a pulsating mass of horror that still breathed. There was no death, only a grotesque defeat.

The thought of help, of the hospital, crossed my mind like a parasite. I knew what it meant: IVs, nutrients, the inevitable transformation back into the soft, deformable mass I so hated from my childhood. NO, I refused. Let the bones be exposed, let the flesh rot, let the organs refuse to beat. I preferred slow putrefaction, I preferred to smell the necrosis and the glory of this ruin, this last and honest version of myself, rather than the torment of my past self. I would die here, my vision intact in my mind, before turning back into the terror of that shapeless mass. My war, at least, would end on my own terms. The silence of the kitchen filled only with the constant drip of my essence, the last tribute to my broken masterpiece.",1,1751305508.0,DarkFantasy,0,1.0,False

1loe1j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1loe1j2/perfect_sculpture/,Perfect sculpture,"My collarbone tore through the skin with a wet snap. It wasn't painful, at least not the kind of pain that makes you scream. It was an exquisite pang, one fiber detaching from another, teeth sinking into a tendon, the joint of a chicken bone. Warm blood welled up, but all I saw was the outline of a new geometry emerging from my flesh, an angle that wasn't there before, proof that I was progressing.

There were weeks when my body was a puzzle in constant redefinition. Like that time, as a child, cold water filled my bladder to the point of asphyxiation, yet my collarbones protruded, and in the mirror, they were perfect daggers, perfect bones. Or when the scarf dug into my waist night after night, the biting pain was the promise of a shape that wouldn't have existed before if I hadn't exerted the right, cutting pressure on that area.

Now, with more years accumulated, the war had escalated. It was no longer just a matter of centimeters or bone beneath the skin. It was liberation. My organs felt like alien entities, prisoners clamoring to escape the confines of my flesh, wanting to do as they pleased. My throat was the hardest, raw and open from so much forcing it to yield, corroded by acid, by countless objects partially inserted. Like that time my palate split open from trying to insert without removing my rings, letting me taste the rusty, metallic flavor of my war. My sunken, vigilant eyes saw the purity of my act, of the transformation; it was the language my body understood to achieve perfection, glorious perfection.

My phone alarm blared at 4 AM. I got out of bed as always, ignoring the creaking of my knees like dry firewood or the dull ache in my ribs. In the bathroom, under the fluorescent light of the mirror, I undressed. My only complaint was that my ribs couldn‚Äôt withstand the pressure of my old scarf‚Äôs knot as they once had; I supposed it was due to the years passing and my spine‚Äôs increasing resemblance to a question mark. The dark circles under my eyes were a side effect of sleepless nights, of my self-imposed vigil. Well, nothing a little concealer couldn‚Äôt fix; I loved chemical advancements that allowed me to build whatever mask I desired each morning. My vertebrae were beautiful, I‚Äôd thought so for a long time, though now that I look, they might have a strange shape‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt look like pointillism, like an escalator to heaven; they look more like wooden steps from a children‚Äôs game.

My routine could be called a cold liturgy. After masking my face, I went to the scale. The number that appeared was my only truth, my daily creed. I looked at my hands that morning. They had always been an offense, a betrayal of the fragility I had to display. I used to massage them, pressing hard, wishing the bone would emerge, that the skin would yield, that those 'baby hands' I hated so much would give way to the sharp delicacy I longed for. I looked at my thighs and smiled. They used to rub together all the time, another affront. I could feel the heat of the friction between them, the evidence of a mass that had to disappear. At night, after the world slept, my exercise routine was the only thing I knew. Hundreds of sit-ups, until the muscles of a 12-year-old girl tore. It wasn't exercise; it was self-sculpting, and it had certainly worked. I was very grateful to my past Laura for that.

I brewed my black coffee. On the kitchen counter was a plate full of food covered with plastic wrap. I approached the plate, removing the protective covering; a cheese and mushroom omelet, a croissant, some blueberries, and a bowl of cooked oatmeal. This was the regular breakfast my mother prepared for me. Back then, I was sooo creative. I remember that while I ate breakfast, my mother would get ready for her day. That was the perfect time to pull out one of the bags I kept under my mattress and in which I could dump that rich breakfast. Then I would sneak into the bathroom and empty its contents into the toilet. Now, well, I was very glad I no longer had to create all that paraphernalia. I took the breakfast, photographed it, added the New York filter from Instagram with the caption: 'Nothing like mom's food.' Then, into the trash bin; I had to take the bag to the deposit; it was already full.

On my way to the office, I remembered how I used to be and how much I had improved, thanks to my mother's breakfast, I suppose. Expulsion was an art I had perfected. I enjoyed, with cruel satisfaction, when I got tonsillitis or laryngitis. The inflammation made it almost impossible to swallow solids, and my mother would force me onto a liquid diet. Blessed infections! Liquids were so easy to eliminate, definitely a blessing. My body, though aching, felt lighter, purer. But it wasn't always so clean. Sometimes, haste or tiredness made me less careful. Like that time, when using the tip of my toothbrush too forcefully, I felt my soft palate perforate. A lot of blood came out, a crimson trickle I didn't know how to stop, so I stole some of Mom's cotton, rolled it, and pushed it to the back, feeling the sticky flow and metallic taste.

Then, diarrhea. A more efficient method, I'd researched. Poorly cooked or expired foods were my new Eucharist. On the scale, the numbers dropped faster than with just vomiting. But they came with a punishment: saline solution. That insidious liquid that promised to 'replenish' me and, to me, contaminate me. I took it, for mom's sake, and then rushed to the bathroom to purge it. That was the era of my greatest decline, my greatest triumph. But you couldn't have diarrhea all year, could you? I smiled remembering it.

At my desk, I tried to dodge my colleagues' glances while offering them a beautiful, toothy, gum-filled smile. Lately, a group from my floor would approach, inviting me to lunch, to share their food. I always declined with a distant attempt at kindness. The last time I accepted one of those invitations, I had to fake a stomachache to retreat to the restaurant bathroom. I vomited some into the sink, but had to use one of the pens from my blouse pocket. I didn‚Äôt notice the pen cap, cutting my upper gum. I felt my mouth fill with gastric juice and a wire-like taste once more. A customer entered the bathroom, saw my grimace of bloody teeth and undigested food bits. He ran out, and I never stepped foot in that place again.

That same night, back in my apartment, darkness was a comfort. My own skin, stretched over my skeleton like old parchment, felt the cold of solitude. Adult life is like this, at least mine, and I had no time during the day, so I sometimes dedicated my nights to making a few repairs. I had to change a lightbulb that hadn‚Äôt worked for a few days, the one in the kitchen. I climbed onto the small folding stool. My legs, thin as reeds, barely trembled. As I reached for the dead bulb, applying minimal pressure to unscrew it, I felt a sharp, fine tug. It wasn't a muscle; it was the sound of something tearing from deep within, fabric ripping not cleanly, but with the brutality of open flesh.

A wet crack, like a rotten branch snapping underfoot, echoed in the kitchen's silence. I felt a sudden, sticky warmth soak my armpit. I looked down. The bone of my humerus, the long bone of my arm, was out of place. It had dislocated with astonishing violence, and its tip, sharp as a knife, had perforated the skin from within. A gush of dark, dense blood, almost black in the gloom, pulsed out, not dripping, but surging with the beat of my racing heart, soaking my shirt.

The light from the bulb, now dangling from a wire, cast grotesque shadows. My arm bent at an impossible angle, the whitish, blood-stained bone protruding. The muscle fibers, sparse and thin, looked like broken threads. A cold sweat covered my forehead. I tried to move, to get off the stool, but my knees, those that creaked like dry firewood in the mornings, gave way completely. This time, there wasn't a dull crunch, but a blast that reverberated through the room. I felt a searing pain. My legs bent backward, my knees pointing the opposite way nature dictated, leaving only a mass of flaccid, deformed flesh and another dark pool of blood rapidly forming beneath me.

I fell to the floor, my body now a pile of torn flesh and exposed, sharp bones. The metallic, rusty smell of my blood filled the kitchen air, mixed with a sweet, nauseating stench of freshly killed animal. The darkness was total, save for the faint hallway light that filtered the broken silhouette of my arm and the deformed mass of my legs. I didn't know where everything was, but I could see the triangle formed by my broken arm along with my torso. My legs were splayed apart, each to its own side. I could see my left femur bone separated in a 1/4 proportion, with 1 being what remained attached to my knee and 4 what remained attached to my hip. My other leg, also broken, had no stabbed tissue; my broken bones hadn't been able to cut through the thick skin of my right leg. But I could see how my knee was bruising, beginning to take the shape of a newborn's head. I could see it clearly, as my right leg had landed beneath my torso when I fell. If it hadn't broken until now, I think the impact had increased the probability. I didn't faint after that; consciousness clung to me with tooth and nail, forcing me to witness the atrocity of my own destruction. This was not the progress or purity I had sought.

I felt desolate, rage piercing my chest. Bitter tears mingled with the sweat and blood on my face. I cried, not from physical pain, not from the mountain of flesh I was now, but from the monstrous injustice. Fifteen years, fifteen damn years, from eleven to twenty-six, sculpting every centimeter, every gram. I had been at heaven's gates, brushing with my fingertips the perfection, that ethereal, almost weightless figure I had built bone by bone. And now, my beautiful masterpiece, my sanctuary, my victory, was a pile of crimson rubble, a pulsating mass of horror that still breathed. There was no death, only a grotesque defeat.

The thought of help, of the hospital, crossed my mind like a parasite. I knew what it meant: IVs, nutrients, the inevitable transformation back into the soft, deformable mass I so hated from my childhood. NO, I refused. Let the bones be exposed, let the flesh rot, let the organs refuse to beat. I preferred slow putrefaction, I preferred to smell the necrosis and the glory of this ruin, this last and honest version of myself, rather than the torment of my past self. I would die here, my vision intact in my mind, before turning back into the terror of that shapeless mass. My war, at least, would end on my own terms.

1lodz9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lodz9e/perfect_sculpture/,Perfect sculpture,"My collarbone tore through the skin with a wet snap. It wasn't painful, at least not the kind of pain that makes you scream. It was an exquisite pang, one fiber detaching from another, teeth sinking into a tendon, the joint of a chicken bone. Warm blood welled up, but all I saw was the outline of a new geometry emerging from my flesh, an angle that wasn't there before, proof that I was progressing.

There were weeks when my body was a puzzle in constant redefinition. Like that time, as a child, cold water filled my bladder to the point of asphyxiation, yet my collarbones protruded, and in the mirror, they were perfect daggers, perfect bones. Or when the scarf dug into my waist night after night, the biting pain was the promise of a shape that wouldn't have existed before if I hadn't exerted the right, cutting pressure on that area.

Now, with more years accumulated, the war had escalated. It was no longer just a matter of centimeters or bone beneath the skin. It was liberation. My organs felt like alien entities, prisoners clamoring to escape the confines of my flesh, wanting to do as they pleased. My throat was the hardest, raw and open from so much forcing it to yield, corroded by acid, by countless objects partially inserted. Like that time my palate split open from trying to insert without removing my rings, letting me taste the rusty, metallic flavor of my war. My sunken, vigilant eyes saw the purity of my act, of the transformation; it was the language my body understood to achieve perfection, glorious perfection.

My phone alarm blared at 4 AM. I got out of bed as always, ignoring the creaking of my knees like dry firewood or the dull ache in my ribs. In the bathroom, under the fluorescent light of the mirror, I undressed. My only complaint was that my ribs couldn‚Äôt withstand the pressure of my old scarf‚Äôs knot as they once had; I supposed it was due to the years passing and my spine‚Äôs increasing resemblance to a question mark. The dark circles under my eyes were a side effect of sleepless nights, of my self-imposed vigil. Well, nothing a little concealer couldn‚Äôt fix; I loved chemical advancements that allowed me to build whatever mask I desired each morning. My vertebrae were beautiful, I‚Äôd thought so for a long time, though now that I look, they might have a strange shape‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt look like pointillism, like an escalator to heaven; they look more like wooden steps from a children‚Äôs game.

My routine could be called a cold liturgy. After masking my face, I went to the scale. The number that appeared was my only truth, my daily creed. I looked at my hands that morning. They had always been an offense, a betrayal of the fragility I had to display. I used to massage them, pressing hard, wishing the bone would emerge, that the skin would yield, that those 'baby hands' I hated so much would give way to the sharp delicacy I longed for. I looked at my thighs and smiled. They used to rub together all the time, another affront. I could feel the heat of the friction between them, the evidence of a mass that had to disappear. At night, after the world slept, my exercise routine was the only thing I knew. Hundreds of sit-ups, until the muscles of a 12-year-old girl tore. It wasn't exercise; it was self-sculpting, and it had certainly worked. I was very grateful to my past Laura for that.

I brewed my black coffee. On the kitchen counter was a plate full of food covered with plastic wrap. I approached the plate, removing the protective covering; a cheese and mushroom omelet, a croissant, some blueberries, and a bowl of cooked oatmeal. This was the regular breakfast my mother prepared for me. Back then, I was sooo creative. I remember that while I ate breakfast, my mother would get ready for her day. That was the perfect time to pull out one of the bags I kept under my mattress and in which I could dump that rich breakfast. Then I would sneak into the bathroom and empty its contents into the toilet. Now, well, I was very glad I no longer had to create all that paraphernalia. I took the breakfast, photographed it, added the New York filter from Instagram with the caption: 'Nothing like mom's food.' Then, into the trash bin; I had to take the bag to the deposit; it was already full.

On my way to the office, I remembered how I used to be and how much I had improved, thanks to my mother's breakfast, I suppose. Expulsion was an art I had perfected. I enjoyed, with cruel satisfaction, when I got tonsillitis or laryngitis. The inflammation made it almost impossible to swallow solids, and my mother would force me onto a liquid diet. Blessed infections! Liquids were so easy to eliminate, definitely a blessing. My body, though aching, felt lighter, purer. But it wasn't always so clean. Sometimes, haste or tiredness made me less careful. Like that time, when using the tip of my toothbrush too forcefully, I felt my soft palate perforate. A lot of blood came out, a crimson trickle I didn't know how to stop, so I stole some of Mom's cotton, rolled it, and pushed it to the back, feeling the sticky flow and metallic taste.

Then, diarrhea. A more efficient method, I'd researched. Poorly cooked or expired foods were my new Eucharist. On the scale, the numbers dropped faster than with just vomiting. But they came with a punishment: saline solution. That insidious liquid that promised to 'replenish' me and, to me, contaminate me. I took it, for mom's sake, and then rushed to the bathroom to purge it. That was the era of my greatest decline, my greatest triumph. But you couldn't have diarrhea all year, could you? I smiled remembering it.

At my desk, I tried to dodge my colleagues' glances while offering them a beautiful, toothy, gum-filled smile. Lately, a group from my floor would approach, inviting me to lunch, to share their food. I always declined with a distant attempt at kindness. The last time I accepted one of those invitations, I had to fake a stomachache to retreat to the restaurant bathroom. I vomited some into the sink, but had to use one of the pens from my blouse pocket. I didn‚Äôt notice the pen cap, cutting my upper gum. I felt my mouth fill with gastric juice and a wire-like taste once more. A customer entered the bathroom, saw my grimace of bloody teeth and undigested food bits. He ran out, and I never stepped foot in that place again.

That same night, back in my apartment, darkness was a comfort. My own skin, stretched over my skeleton like old parchment, felt the cold of solitude. Adult life is like this, at least mine, and I had no time during the day, so I sometimes dedicated my nights to making a few repairs. I had to change a lightbulb that hadn‚Äôt worked for a few days, the one in the kitchen. I climbed onto the small folding stool. My legs, thin as reeds, barely trembled. As I reached for the dead bulb, applying minimal pressure to unscrew it, I felt a sharp, fine tug. It wasn't a muscle; it was the sound of something tearing from deep within, fabric ripping not cleanly, but with the brutality of open flesh.

A wet crack, like a rotten branch snapping underfoot, echoed in the kitchen's silence. I felt a sudden, sticky warmth soak my armpit. I looked down. The bone of my humerus, the long bone of my arm, was out of place. It had dislocated with astonishing violence, and its tip, sharp as a knife, had perforated the skin from within. A gush of dark, dense blood, almost black in the gloom, pulsed out, not dripping, but surging with the beat of my racing heart, soaking my shirt.

The light from the bulb, now dangling from a wire, cast grotesque shadows. My arm bent at an impossible angle, the whitish, blood-stained bone protruding. The muscle fibers, sparse and thin, looked like broken threads. A cold sweat covered my forehead. I tried to move, to get off the stool, but my knees, those that creaked like dry firewood in the mornings, gave way completely. This time, there wasn't a dull crunch, but a blast that reverberated through the room. I felt a searing pain. My legs bent backward, my knees pointing the opposite way nature dictated, leaving only a mass of flaccid, deformed flesh and another dark pool of blood rapidly forming beneath me.

I fell to the floor, my body now a pile of torn flesh and exposed, sharp bones. The metallic, rusty smell of my blood filled the kitchen air, mixed with a sweet, nauseating stench of freshly killed animal. The darkness was total, save for the faint hallway light that filtered the broken silhouette of my arm and the deformed mass of my legs. I didn't know where everything was, but I could see the triangle formed by my broken arm along with my torso. My legs were splayed apart, each to its own side. I could see my left femur bone separated in a 1/4 proportion, with 1 being what remained attached to my knee and 4 what remained attached to my hip. My other leg, also broken, had no stabbed tissue; my broken bones hadn't been able to cut through the thick skin of my right leg. But I could see how my knee was bruising, beginning to take the shape of a newborn's head. I could see it clearly, as my right leg had landed beneath my torso when I fell. If it hadn't broken until now, I think the impact had increased the probability. I didn't faint after that; consciousness clung to me with tooth and nail, forcing me to witness the atrocity of my own destruction. This was not the progress or purity I had sought.

I felt desolate, rage piercing my chest. Bitter tears mingled with the sweat and blood on my face. I cried, not from physical pain, not from the mountain of flesh I was now, but from the monstrous injustice. Fifteen years, fifteen damn years, from eleven to twenty-six, sculpting every centimeter, every gram. I had been at heaven's gates, brushing with my fingertips the perfection, that ethereal, almost weightless figure I had built bone by bone. And now, my beautiful masterpiece, my sanctuary, my victory, was a pile of crimson rubble, a pulsating mass of horror that still breathed. There was no death, only a grotesque defeat.

The thought of help, of the hospital, crossed my mind like a parasite. I knew what it meant: IVs, nutrients, the inevitable transformation back into the soft, deformable mass I so hated from my childhood. NO, I refused. Let the bones be exposed, let the flesh rot, let the organs refuse to beat. I preferred slow putrefaction, I preferred to smell the necrosis and the glory of this ruin, this last and honest version of myself, rather than the torment of my past self. I would die here, my vision intact in my mind, before turning back into the terror of that shapeless mass. My war, at least, would end on my own terms.

Need help.,"I have a 3' live-edge slab of olivewood that I am trying to turn into a coffee table and for the life of me I cannot get the finish to look like anything other than complete shit. I have literally finished and sanded it off and re-finished probably ten times already and no matter what I do the finish looks like garbage. I've tried everything, tried different applicators (fine brush, applicator pad, microfiber cloth, spray on finish, rollers), tried different brands and sheens of finish (Minwax, General Finishes, water-based, oil-based, matte, semi-gloss), tried to mimic the techniques I saw in the dozen+ videos I watched with light pressure and even coats. And absolutely nothing is working. Regardless of which application method I'm using and regardless of how delicate I try to be, I simply can't get rid of the lap lines. Its either an uneven splotchy mess from trying to fix and smooth the coat as much as I can after the application (which I know is futile, back brushing or trying to fix it with a second pass just ruins the whole coat), or the final finish is so rough with lap lines that it looks so ugly I simply can't leave it un-sanded. But of course doing so just ruins the the whole finish and I have to start from scratch, again. I've been working on this thing for weeks. And there is no end in sight because every single attempt I've made looks abysmal.

  
I am so ready to just toss this thing in the garbage and be done with it because this experience has completely ruined the enthusiasm I had for this hobby. Please help....",1,1751305236.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,3,1.0,False

On my way to the office, I remembered how I used to be and how much I had improved, thanks to my mother's breakfast, I suppose. Expulsion was an art I had perfected. I enjoyed, with cruel satisfaction, when I got tonsillitis or laryngitis. The inflammation made it almost impossible to swallow solids, and my mother would force me onto a liquid diet. Blessed infections! Liquids were so easy to eliminate, definitely a blessing. My body, though aching, felt lighter, purer. But it wasn't always so clean. Sometimes, haste or tiredness made me less careful. Like that time, when using the tip of my toothbrush too forcefully, I felt my soft palate perforate. A lot of blood came out, a crimson trickle I didn't know how to stop, so I stole some of Mom's cotton, rolled it, and pushed it to the back, feeling the sticky flow and metallic taste.

Then, diarrhea. A more efficient method, I'd researched. Poorly cooked or expired foods were my new Eucharist. On the scale, the numbers dropped faster than with just vomiting. But they came with a punishment: saline solution. That insidious liquid that promised to 'replenish' me and, to me, contaminate me. I took it, for mom's sake, and then rushed to the bathroom to purge it. That was the era of my greatest decline, my greatest triumph. But you couldn't have diarrhea all year, could you? I smiled remembering it.

At my desk, I tried to dodge my colleagues' glances while offering them a beautiful, toothy, gum-filled smile. Lately, a group from my floor would approach, inviting me to lunch, to share their food. I always declined with a distant attempt at kindness. The last time I accepted one of those invitations, I had to fake a stomachache to retreat to the restaurant bathroom. I vomited some into the sink, but had to use one of the pens from my blouse pocket. I didn‚Äôt notice the pen cap, cutting my upper gum. I felt my mouth fill with gastric juice and a wire-like taste once more. A customer entered the bathroom, saw my grimace of bloody teeth and undigested food bits. He ran out, and I never stepped foot in that place again.

That same night, back in my apartment, darkness was a comfort. My own skin, stretched over my skeleton like old parchment, felt the cold of solitude. Adult life is like this, at least mine, and I had no time during the day, so I sometimes dedicated my nights to making a few repairs. I had to change a lightbulb that hadn‚Äôt worked for a few days, the one in the kitchen. I climbed onto the small folding stool. My legs, thin as reeds, barely trembled. As I reached for the dead bulb, applying minimal pressure to unscrew it, I felt a sharp, fine tug. It wasn't a muscle; it was the sound of something tearing from deep within, fabric ripping not cleanly, but with the brutality of open flesh.

A wet crack, like a rotten branch snapping underfoot, echoed in the kitchen's silence. I felt a sudden, sticky warmth soak my armpit. I looked down. The bone of my humerus, the long bone of my arm, was out of place. It had dislocated with astonishing violence, and its tip, sharp as a knife, had perforated the skin from within. A gush of dark, dense blood, almost black in the gloom, pulsed out, not dripping, but surging with the beat of my racing heart, soaking my shirt.

The light from the bulb, now dangling from a wire, cast grotesque shadows. My arm bent at an impossible angle, the whitish, blood-stained bone protruding. The muscle fibers, sparse and thin, looked like broken threads. A cold sweat covered my forehead. I tried to move, to get off the stool, but my knees, those that creaked like dry firewood in the mornings, gave way completely. This time, there wasn't a dull crunch, but a blast that reverberated through the room. I felt a searing pain. My legs bent backward, my knees pointing the opposite way nature dictated, leaving only a mass of flaccid, deformed flesh and another dark pool of blood rapidly forming beneath me.

I fell to the floor, my body now a pile of torn flesh and exposed, sharp bones. The metallic, rusty smell of my blood filled the kitchen air, mixed with a sweet, nauseating stench of freshly killed animal. The darkness was total, save for the faint hallway light that filtered the broken silhouette of my arm and the deformed mass of my legs. I didn't know where everything was, but I could see the triangle formed by my broken arm along with my torso. My legs were splayed apart, each to its own side. I could see my left femur bone separated in a 1/4 proportion, with 1 being what remained attached to my knee and 4 what remained attached to my hip. My other leg, also broken, had no stabbed tissue; my broken bones hadn't been able to cut through the thick skin of my right leg. But I could see how my knee was bruising, beginning to take the shape of a newborn's head. I could see it clearly, as my right leg had landed beneath my torso when I fell. If it hadn't broken until now, I think the impact had increased the probability. I didn't faint after that; consciousness clung to me with tooth and nail, forcing me to witness the atrocity of my own destruction. This was not the progress or purity I had sought.

I felt desolate, rage piercing my chest. Bitter tears mingled with the sweat and blood on my face. I cried, not from physical pain, not from the mountain of flesh I was now, but from the monstrous injustice. Fifteen years, fifteen damn years, from eleven to twenty-six, sculpting every centimeter, every gram. I had been at heaven's gates, brushing with my fingertips the perfection, that ethereal, almost weightless figure I had built bone by bone. And now, my beautiful masterpiece, my sanctuary, my victory, was a pile of crimson rubble, a pulsating mass of horror that still breathed. There was no death, only a grotesque defeat.

The thought of help, of the hospital, crossed my mind like a parasite. I knew what it meant: IVs, nutrients, the inevitable transformation back into the soft, deformable mass I so hated from my childhood. NO, I refused. Let the bones be exposed, let the flesh rot, let the organs refuse to beat. I preferred slow putrefaction, I preferred to smell the necrosis and the glory of this ruin, this last and honest version of myself, rather than the torment of my past self. I would die here, my vision intact in my mind, before turning back into the terror of that shapeless mass. My war, at least, would end on my own terms. The silence of the kitchen filled only with the constant drip of my essence, the last tribute to my broken masterpiece.",2,1751305223.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

I am curious if anyone has experimented with this. I have my hands on some silver needle white tea that is maybe with caffeine on par with a regular cup of green tea.

so if the caffeine levels are more or less similar.....if you have have extensively experimented with all 4 of these tea (oolong, puer, green & white) .....which one would you pick up for studying all day?

suggestions/recommendation/insight compilation :

1. Some one recommended coffee....but I am talking about 8-10 hour study sessions a day...and coffee last for me maybe 1.5 hour max & drinking 3 or 4 cups is too much whether cortisol level or insomnia...though there are people I know who can consume a high amount without issues.  For me personally, I wouldn't use it all day.
2. Someone recommended black tea....the reason I did not include black tea is same as coffee. It's not one study session...I am talking about 8-10 hours which means...need stimulus multiple times a day & later in the evening as well....unless black tea seems inappropriate at that time I would rather not. However, feel free to share your insights if why/if you have found it to work for you.
3. People recommending Matcha, I feel like lot of the issues with Black Tea in #2 applies. If you have  personal hacks to using Matcha later in the evening that would be interesting.",2,1751305200.0,tea,5,1.0,False

1lodxnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1lodxnx/perfect_sculpture/,Perfect sculpture,"My collarbone tore through the skin with a wet snap. It wasn't painful, at least not the kind of pain that makes you scream. It was an exquisite pang, one fiber detaching from another, teeth sinking into a tendon, the joint of a chicken bone. Warm blood welled up, but all I saw was the outline of a new geometry emerging from my flesh, an angle that wasn't there before, proof that I was progressing.

There were weeks when my body was a puzzle in constant redefinition. Like that time, as a child, cold water filled my bladder to the point of asphyxiation, yet my collarbones protruded, and in the mirror, they were perfect daggers, perfect bones. Or when the scarf dug into my waist night after night, the biting pain was the promise of a shape that wouldn't have existed before if I hadn't exerted the right, cutting pressure on that area.

Now, with more years accumulated, the war had escalated. It was no longer just a matter of centimeters or bone beneath the skin. It was liberation. My organs felt like alien entities, prisoners clamoring to escape the confines of my flesh, wanting to do as they pleased. My throat was the hardest, raw and open from so much forcing it to yield, corroded by acid, by countless objects partially inserted. Like that time my palate split open from trying to insert without removing my rings, letting me taste the rusty, metallic flavor of my war. My sunken, vigilant eyes saw the purity of my act, of the transformation; it was the language my body understood to achieve perfection, glorious perfection.

My phone alarm blared at 4 AM. I got out of bed as always, ignoring the creaking of my knees like dry firewood or the dull ache in my ribs. In the bathroom, under the fluorescent light of the mirror, I undressed. My only complaint was that my ribs couldn‚Äôt withstand the pressure of my old scarf‚Äôs knot as they once had; I supposed it was due to the years passing and my spine‚Äôs increasing resemblance to a question mark. The dark circles under my eyes were a side effect of sleepless nights, of my self-imposed vigil. Well, nothing a little concealer couldn‚Äôt fix; I loved chemical advancements that allowed me to build whatever mask I desired each morning. My vertebrae were beautiful, I‚Äôd thought so for a long time, though now that I look, they might have a strange shape‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt look like pointillism, like an escalator to heaven; they look more like wooden steps from a children‚Äôs game.

My routine could be called a cold liturgy. After masking my face, I went to the scale. The number that appeared was my only truth, my daily creed. I looked at my hands that morning. They had always been an offense, a betrayal of the fragility I had to display. I used to massage them, pressing hard, wishing the bone would emerge, that the skin would yield, that those 'baby hands' I hated so much would give way to the sharp delicacy I longed for. I looked at my thighs and smiled. They used to rub together all the time, another affront. I could feel the heat of the friction between them, the evidence of a mass that had to disappear. At night, after the world slept, my exercise routine was the only thing I knew. Hundreds of sit-ups, until the muscles of a 12-year-old girl tore. It wasn't exercise; it was self-sculpting, and it had certainly worked. I was very grateful to my past Laura for that.

I brewed my black coffee. On the kitchen counter was a plate full of food covered with plastic wrap. I approached the plate, removing the protective covering; a cheese and mushroom omelet, a croissant, some blueberries, and a bowl of cooked oatmeal. This was the regular breakfast my mother prepared for me. Back then, I was sooo creative. I remember that while I ate breakfast, my mother would get ready for her day. That was the perfect time to pull out one of the bags I kept under my mattress and in which I could dump that rich breakfast. Then I would sneak into the bathroom and empty its contents into the toilet. Now, well, I was very glad I no longer had to create all that paraphernalia. I took the breakfast, photographed it, added the New York filter from Instagram with the caption: 'Nothing like mom's food.' Then, into the trash bin; I had to take the bag to the deposit; it was already full.

1lodww8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lodww8/explore_best_coffee_maker_cuisinart_ss4n1nas_and/,Explore Best Coffee Maker Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS and Is It Worth It,"Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS, the multitasking champion of coffee machines, has been living on my kitchen counter for the past month. As someone who enjoys both the simplicity of drip coffee and the occasional indulgence of a cappuccino, investing in this coffee center felt like a no-brainer. The name itself suggests versatility, and I was eager to put it to the test from day one.

**Design and Build Quality**

Setting up this machine next to the toaster and blender felt like introducing a new celebrity to the kitchen lineup. Its sleek black exterior with a solid finish is modern and understated, but boy, does it command attention. Measuring about 11.88"" by 12.88"" and standing tall at 16.75"", it‚Äôs a compact unit given all the features it packs in. Despite its slightly bulky weight of 14 pounds, the design makes it feel sturdy rather than cumbersome. The control panel operates with intuitive buttons, making the learning curve almost nonexistent. Whether it was me or my less technologically inclined family members, everyone managed to brew something within minutes of fiddling around with it.

**Multiple Brewing Options**

Let me tell you, this wasn‚Äôt just a drip coffee maker masquerading as a multitool. The Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS genuinely delivers on its promise of variety. The 12-cup glass carafe was the star during family breakfasts, brewing enough coffee to fuel everyone without needing to run the machine twice. On quieter mornings, I leaned into the single-serve function, choosing between the 6oz, 8oz, and 10oz brewing sizes, perfect for my moody relationship with caffeine levels. And then there‚Äôs the Nespresso capsule compatibility. Popping in Nespresso OriginalLine capsules for a shot of espresso felt like a mid-week treat. The steam wand added another layer of joy ‚Äî a perfectly frothed cappuccino made me feel like a barista without leaving home. 

[Check Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0bwsmv57f/)

**Good Aspects**

This coffee machine has a list of good points so long it could rival my to-do lists. Here are the highlights:

- Programmable 24-hour brewing for fresh coffee at any time of day.
- Adjustable Keep Warm and Brew Pause features add a level of personalization.
- Single-serve adaptability supports both pods and Nespresso capsules.
- Steam wand doubles up as a hot water dispenser for tea, matcha, and even reheating soup.

With this flexibility, it‚Äôs easy to see why this machine feels like an entire caf√© rolled into one piece of hardware.

**Shortcomings**

Even with all its capabilities, there were a few areas for improvement that stood out:

- The steam wand, while great for frothing milk, tends to splash water during the heating process, leading to some unwelcome clean-up.
- It takes some trial and error to find the perfect settings for espresso shots. They weren‚Äôt always as strong as I hoped initially.
- At 16.75‚Äù in height, it barely tucks under my upper kitchen cabinets. Lower countertops might make accessing the water reservoir tricky.

These are small annoyances in the grand scheme of things, but worth mentioning for potential buyers with limited counter space or high expectations from the steam wand.

**Ease of Use**

One of the first things I noticed was the simplicity of its operation. The interface doesn‚Äôt overwhelm you with a cryptic menu or overly technical jargon; it‚Äôs a straightforward ‚Äúpress and go‚Äù experience. However, customization options for brew strength and the built-in permanent gold-tone filter mean that coffee lovers can still get their desired flavor depth without hassle. Cleaning the components, especially the carafe and the reusable filter, is also refreshingly simple. Just a quick rinse, and you‚Äôre good to go!

**Competing Products**

The world of coffee makers is crowded, and this machine inevitably invites comparisons to other big names, such as the Keurig K-Caf√© and Nespresso VertuoPlus. While the Keurig K-Caf√© matches the Cuisinart‚Äôs single-serve functionality and also includes a frother, the Cuisinart goes further with its full-fledged 12-cup carafe setup. That‚Äôs a major win for anyone who needs to brew coffee in bulk regularly. Meanwhile, the Nespresso VertuoPlus shines with its seamless espresso-making but doesn‚Äôt carry the multi-use brewing versatility Cuisinart offers. What really gives this product a leg up is its combination of functions ‚Äî perfect for those who don‚Äôt want to settle for either-or when it comes to brewing.

**Bang for the Buck**

Given the variety it offers, the Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS more than justifies its price tag. Sure, there are cheaper machines on the market, but I found those either limited to one brewing function or incapable of delivering the same level of quality in different modes. The programmability and versatility of this unit make it entirely worth the cost. It‚Äôs not just a coffee maker; it‚Äôs an investment in lazy weekend mornings and quick weekday starts.

First, pink grapefruit essential oil can cause skin irritation if exposed to sunlight. Second, coconut and pear are probably going to be better suited to balance any acidity from the coffee.

2. Need to use a lilac fragrance oil instead of an actual lilac essential oil, because lilac essential oil doesn't exist. Something about the chemical composition of lilac scent prevents it from being directly made into an essential oil.

3. Seems like using ethanol as a carrier is widely considered ""better"" or more professional than a carrier oil, so I'll probably do that.

4. Possible to make the coffee scent directly from coffee beans, so I'll use my gf's favorite coffee for this.

5. Not really possible to make the pear and coconut scents directly from pears and coconuts, so I'll have to buy ethyl decadienoate, cis-3-hexenol (pear), and gamma-nonalactone (coconut).

6. I'm a little concerned that there aren't enough notes. Pear is usually a top note, coconut and coffee are usually base notes, and lilac can be a heart note... But I feel like this might not be enough. Experimentation required. Although in [this](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rochas/Alchimie-2149.html) fragrance, lilac is top and coconut is middle.

1lodkoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lodkoy/is_the_peach_street_electric_kettle_the_best/,Is the Peach Street Electric Kettle the Best Choice for Quick Boiling?,"Jumping into my experience with the Peach Street PE-1302, I truly didn‚Äôt expect an electric kettle to change my mornings, but here we are. From the first day I tested it, this little machine became a quiet hero in my kitchen. Boiling water for coffee or tea had always been a chore that felt slower than watching paint dry. This model, though, with its 1,500-watt power and OTTER controller, takes the concept of ‚Äúspeed-boil‚Äù to heart. I found it almost amusing how quickly it brought water to a rolling boil, and the blue light illuminating the glass gave it some cool sci-fi vibes in the process. It‚Äôs not just a kettle ‚Äì it‚Äôs a mini light show on my countertop.

**Good Points**  
- The borosilicate glass is both attractive and durable, and it doesn‚Äôt stain or retain odors like some plastic kettles out there.  
- Safety? They've nailed that too, with an auto-shutoff feature that kicks in once the water boils and a concealed heating element to prevent any funny business with toxins.  
- Cordless functionality after lifting off the 360¬∞ rotating base is a game-changer for smooth, uninterrupted pouring.  

After falling in love with the speed of boiling and sleek design, reality hit once I needed to clean it. That wide opening with the pop-open top made cleaning way easier than my last kettle, but after weeks of constant use, I did notice some limescale build-up typical for where I live. I appreciated that the interior markings for water measurement stayed prominent, even after several washes.

[Find the best price for Peach Street PE-1302 on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b0b2q7n54s/)

**Rotating Base and Ergonomic Design**  
One feature I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd care about but ended up appreciating a lot was the 360¬∞ rotating base. It doesn't matter from which angle you approach it; this kettle just works. Placing it back on the base felt satisfying ‚Äì like snapping a Lego piece into place. The built-in mesh filter was a neat addition, too. I occasionally threw in tea bags and bits of fruit, and the filter ensured no unwanted debris ended up in my cup. This kettle wasn‚Äôt just quick but versatile too.

**Comfort and Safety Matters**  
Safety features stood out to me after a hectic tea-making session where my kid nearly knocked the kettle over. It had just boiled, but the auto-shutoff had thankfully already kicked in. The handle remained cool to the touch, so handling it immediately wasn‚Äôt a cause for second-guessing. There‚Äôs a note of caution about pouring without the lid fully closed, though. That‚Äôs where this kettle keeps you attentive.

**Cooking Experience**  
While I originally bought it for tea and coffee, it quickly became my assistant for other tasks in the kitchen, like boiling water for pasta or flash-prepping a cup of instant noodles. Its ability to multitask meant I was using it several times a day. The kettle‚Äôs size struck a perfect balance ‚Äì it‚Äôs large enough to hold up to 1.7 liters (plenty even for a little family), yet compact enough not to dominate my counter space.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Despite its brilliance, the glass body shows water spots after frequent use unless you obsessively dry it.  
- Limescale issues arise fast in hard water areas, so regular cleaning is a must.  
- The lid release button, though convenient, feels a bit light and could benefit from a sturdier build.

**Product Alternatives**  
Looking around, I found competitors that tried to rival its features. For instance, other models like the Cosori glass kettle offered similar aesthetics but lacked the ergonomic base design this one excels at. Meanwhile, stainless steel kettles seemed to beat this in durability but didn‚Äôt bring the charm of the blue LED glow or the crystal-clear glass that Peach Street delivered. Each of these options had their merits, but for someone seeking a balance of style, performance, and safety, this kettle stood out comfortably.

**Value for Money**  
When I stacked this model against alternatives on the market, its features and performance hold their weight convincingly. You‚Äôre investing in a robust balance of aesthetics, safety, and power efficiency. Without dropping specific pricing here, let‚Äôs just say it earns its spot in the kitchen. Durable materials like brushed stainless steel accents and borosilicate glass ensure it‚Äôs not a short-term fling but a dependable companion for years. Would I recommend it? Yeah, no question.

I recently wrote an article about something I think a lot of us unknowingly get wrong: plastic recycling. Most of us toss anything with a recycling symbol into the bin, assuming it's all good‚Äîbut unfortunately, that‚Äôs not how it works. I dug into why some plastics aren‚Äôt accepted curbside, how to tell the difference, and what *wishcycling* actually does to the system.

Some takeaways:

* Only plastics #1 and #2 are widely accepted curbside.
* Things like plastic bags, foam containers, and coffee cup lids usually aren't recyclable at home.
* Contamination (like greasy containers or plastic films) can ruin entire loads.
* Wishcycling might *feel* right, but it causes real damage‚Äîlike higher costs and more landfill waste.

If you're into zero waste, sustainability, or just trying to be a better recycler, I think you'll find this useful.

I am a PR manager for a small startup company. They are overseas, I work remotely. I am technically a contractor however I bill them hourly, participate in team meetings, and work closely with other contractors so day-to-day; the terms of our contract are ongoing indefinitely, so I would say I feel more like an employee than a contractor. That said, I am part time and I am generally only able to work 12 hours per week at most (I'd work more if they would allow me, but currently they can't).

I am struggling a bit with how to ethically bill my hours. Lunch breaks are one thing, but I am something of a Pomodoro worker. I get up from my computer to use the bathroom or make a cup of coffee pretty regularly. I don't think I can sit down and laser focus for 3h at a time, but in practice I do bill for a 3h block even if I was up and away from my desk for a total of 20 minutes or more during that period.

This is part of why I really preferred billing for deliverables when I used to do freelance journalism. If I'm just being paid $150 to write an article, I am very comfortable picking away at it in 15 minute bursts OR randomly locking in for a 4 hour research binge at my leisure. But now that I am hourly I feel like my incentives are way off. I am not incentivised to get work done fast, but I *am* incentivised to be more locked into my chair while I am working.

I am also struggling with what counts as ""work"" for me (like technically scrolling Twitter is part of my job description), I do not know where I should be drawing the line there. But maybe that is a separate issue altogether.

I'd like to ask y'all for advice *before* asking my employer, because they in some ways have conflicting incentives to me and I'd rather come to them with a proposal based on *my* productivity habits rather than asking them to solve this problem for me.

As pack politics and betrayal collide, Mila must confront the fractures in her bond with Casen, while Aya‚Äôs desperate devotion threatens to upend their lives. Torn between duty and love, Mila faces an impossible choice: stand by as another woman raises her mate‚Äôs heir, or reclaim her power‚Äîeven if it means destroying everything. But when Aya‚Äôs true motives surface, the question remains: whose game is really being played

Chapter 1 - Midnight Heir and Broken Bonds

The phone call from Alpha Casen Freeman jolted me awake at 2 a.m.

His deep voice carried the unmistakable weight of an alpha command even through the phone, rough and shaky: ""Luna Mila, something's happened.""

I sat up immediately, my wolf stirring with unease. ""Weren't you at the border negotiations? What's wrong?""

A heavy silence followed, thick with the scent of distress that even the distance couldn't mask. ""Aya Morales... she's pregnant. Eight months.""

My breath caught in my throat. ""You two‚Äî?""

""No,"" he growled, the alpha tone making the walls vibrate. ""I've never touched her.""

Before my wolf could settle, he delivered the blow. ""The pack Healer just mind-linked me. She collapsed‚Äîthey found my name as her emergency contact. She's at the infirmary now.""

By the time I arrived, the pack Healer had just finished his examination. The sterile scent of antiseptic mixed with the underlying musk of wolves in distress.

""The pup is stable,"" the Healer announced, his posture respectfully bowed toward Casen. ""Preliminary diagnosis suggests malnutrition caused her collapse.""

Casen's massive frame leaned against the wall, his usual dominant aura flickering with something raw. ""She did something unthinkable.""

The words came out like gravel. ""She used my genetic material.""

I whirled on him, my Luna instincts flaring. ""What?""

""Remember that fertility study the Lycan Council mandated for all unmated alphas five years ago? She... stole my sample.""

His next words hit with the force of an alpha command. ""She claims she wants nothing‚Äîjust to give me an heir.""

The bitter truth settled between us like a challenge to our mate bond. ""Because she knows I'm barren. Because every alpha needs a blood heir.""

The unspoken fracture in our bond, the one we'd carefully avoided acknowledging, now lay exposed by an omega's scheming.

Inside the infirmary, Aya blinked awake. When her omega scent‚Äîweak with distress‚Äîhit my nose, she struggled to rise, her trembling fingers clutching at my sleeve.

""Luna Mila,"" she whispered, her submissive posture at odds with the feverish glint in her eyes, ""I never meant to challenge your position.""

""I know my place as an omega. But this pup carries Alpha Casen's blood.""

Her nails pricked my skin through the fabric. ""I love him, but I respect the mate bond.""

""Let me bear this pup‚Äîthen I'll leave the pack forever.""

The air thickened with the scent of Casen's conflicted emotions behind me. ""Luna, the pup's innocent. So is she.""

A hollow laugh escaped me.

""Eight moons, Alpha. You waited eight moons to tell your Luna. Your restraint is admirable.""

Silence.

I'd always sensed Aya was different.

The orphaned omega daughter of Casen's late mentor, she'd been skulking around our territory since her first heat.

Casen had granted her special privileges‚Äîpack protection, living quarters near the alpha residence, even personal escort through dangerous borderlands.

Aya never bothered with subtlety.

The ""accidental"" midnight mind-links pleading for protection.

Appearing at our den in sheer sleeping silks, claiming rogue wolves threatened her.

""Conveniently"" falling ill every time I led border patrols‚Äîeach performance more desperate than the last.

# Chapter 2 - The Weight of Betrayal

He maintained his usual alpha composure, the deep timbre of his voice carrying that familiar commanding edge. ""This is inappropriate."" But his aura never truly turned hostile, never held the sharpness it should have toward an omega who'd violated pack law.

""She's my mentor's only surviving pup, with no pack to call her own. As Alpha, I can't be too harsh.""

He believed he was being just‚Äîfair even. But he didn't understand.

For an omega who'd spent years pining after her Alpha, even the barest hint of tolerance was permission to sink her claws deeper.

I inclined my head, my Luna mask firmly in place. ""The pup is no concern of mine. Keep it if you wish.""

My wolf snarled inside me, the pain of the fractured mate bond like shards of glass in my chest. I threw myself into border patrols, taking the farthest routes that would keep me away from pack lands for days at a time.

When I returned, the whelping was over‚Äîa male pup.

I stood outside the infirmary wing, the scent of newborn and milk thick in the air. Laughter spilled through the door, bright and domestic.

Casen had once pressed his forehead to mine in our mating bed, his alpha scent enveloping me as he vowed, ""In this world, you're the only one who holds my heart.""

Now, his deep voice crooned to the squalling infant in his arms, all rough edges smoothed away. ""Hush now, little warrior. Your Alpha loves you more than the moon itself.""

Aya flipped through a pup-rearing scroll, her omega scent sweet with contentment. ""His nose is all Alpha Casen, but those eyes‚Äîthey're mine, don't you think?""

Casen rumbled in agreement. ""We'll name him Casey‚Äîafter his sire's bloodline.""

I stood at the threshold, my Luna presence unmistakable, yet neither noticed me until I cleared my throat.

Casen's head snapped up, his alpha aura flickering with something like guilt before shuttering closed. ""Luna Mila.""

The room went silent as I stepped inside.

""Sister,"" Aya began, her voice dripping with false humility, ""if my presence displeases you, I'll raise the pup alone in the omega quarters. I swear I'll never‚Äî""

Before, she'd addressed me with proper respect as ""Luna."" Now it was the intimate ""sister.""

Before, she'd promised to surrender the pup. Now she clutched the blankets like a claim.

My lips curled. ""Aya Morales, I didn't realize omegas from Crimson Fang were so... inventive with their petitions?""

Her eyes welled with manufactured tears. ""I knew Alpha Casen longed for an heir. I only wished to serve my Alpha and Luna.""

I tossed the Lycan Council edict onto her sickbed.

""Unauthorized use of an alpha's genetic material carries exile or death. You were raised in a scholar's den‚Äîdon't pretend ignorance of our laws.""

Her face went ashen.

The pup chose that moment to wail, and Casen was there instantly, cradling the infant against his broad chest with a protectiveness that cracked something inside me.

In that moment, the truth settled like a weight‚Äîthis pup would always stand between us, a living testament to betrayal.

I turned to leave, but Casen caught my wrist, his grip firm yet pleading.

""Luna Mila."" His voice was low, the alpha tone bleeding through. ""Your mercy in not bringing this before the council won't be forgotten. But there's more... The healer says Aya's recovery is slow. The riverside lodge has southern exposure‚Äîgood for healing. After she's discharged...""

My claws unsheathed without thought. ""You'd bring her into our den?""

""She has no pack, no family."" His amber eyes held that infuriating calm, the same look he used when settling disputes between warriors. ""She needs care, Luna. That's all.""

I met his gaze, the mate bond screaming between us, and asked the only question that mattered:

""And what does your Luna need?""

# Chapter 3 - A Bitter Farewell Under the Silver Moon

""If you truly find this arrangement unsuitable... you may relocate to Eastwood Manor first. It's more secluded, farther from the packhouse.""

His solution tasted like ash in my mouth. A bitter laugh escaped my lips as I turned to leave.

I first met Alpha Casen Freeman ten years ago, during the Silver Moon Pack's annual gathering of scholars.

Fresh from my studies abroad, he stood among the elder Alphas, his broad shoulders straining against the ceremonial leathers every ranking werewolf wore during formal events. Even then, his alpha aura commanded the room without effort.

Most of the questions from the council were perfunctory, but he zeroed in on the weakest point of my presentation with surgical precision.

""I've reviewed your moon cycle tracking system‚Äîyour methodology was flawless in the northern territories.""

That's when I realized‚Äîhe wasn't tearing me down. He was pushing me to be better.

After that, our paths intertwined naturally.

We worked side by side on pack security systems, spent nights mapping patrol routes under the full moon, debated strategy until dawn. He always noticed what others missed‚Äîa loose border marker here, an overlooked scent trail there.

I fell in love with him over something absurdly simple.

One evening, after hours reviewing defense protocols, he suddenly went silent. Without a word, he led me to a hidden clearing where the pack's omegas had set up a makeshift feast after the hunt.

A rough-hewn table, two exhausted warriors who'd forgotten to eat.

He removed the wolfsbane garnish from my plate‚Äîknowing it irritated my senses‚Äîthen used his own sleeve to wipe venison grease from my fingers when I fumbled with the cutlery.

""Luna Mila,"" he'd said, his alpha voice softening just for me, ""Your fierceness is your strength. But not every battle needs your claws. Save your fury for what truly matters.""

In that moment, with moonlight catching the gold in his eyes, I knew‚Äîthis was the mate the Moon Goddess had chosen for me.

Now, I can't trace where the threads began to unravel.

If this is about heirs, then \*he\* betrayed me first.

Three years into our mating, rogues ambushed us during a border inspection.

Instinct took over‚ÄîI shifted mid-leap to shield him from the silver-coated claws. The searing pain as they tore through my flank felt like being flayed alive.

He carried my wolf form back to the healers, his howls of rage shaking the trees. That night, as I lay bandaged in our den, his entire body trembled as he pressed his forehead to mine‚Äîthe most intimate gesture a mated pair can share.

""Mila,"" his voice broke like splintering bone, ""I swear by the Moon Goddess‚Äîyou're all I'll ever need. For as long as I draw breath.""

The salt of his tears burned where they touched my mating mark.

After that, I never mentioned pups again.

Yet Aya Morales now cradled his offspring.

My claws extended as I typed the message with deliberate precision:

\*\*Alpha Casen, I, Mila Peterson, Luna of the Silver Moon Pack, reject you as my mate.\*\*

The bond between us screamed in protest, but I silenced it with the steel in my veins. The same steel that had once defended him. The same steel he'd now forced me to turn against us both.

Nobody expected it to come to this.  When two countries at war turned to five, turned to twenty, turned to the entire world.  Nowhere near as many people got drafted as we were expecting.  Drones took centre stage as thousands of airborne, lifeless soldiers rained hellfire on less technologically advanced countries.  Drone strikes and missile strikes tore apart foreign countries that we once would have holidayed abroad in, soaking up their year-long summers, or skied down their pure white mountain slopes, and taking advantage of exchange rates that made us feel rich.  What could they do?  What did they have to turn the tide?

We all knew of nuclear weaponry.  People in the streets spent years calling for countries to denuclearize, or for the naive hope of world peace.  People always fight.  Power hungry, paranoid and insecure people became leaders, became dictators, became tyrants.  We did what we thought powerful countries should do, we intervened, we tried to help.  But they thought back.  We tried to help. We did what was right, didn‚Äôt we?  
Shop shelves emptied, slowly at first.  Cupboard staples became more costly as fatcats seeing market opportunity in quiet fear turned up the prices of long-life canned goods, and even loo roll.  It was like the pandemic all over again.  People walking out of shops with more loo roll than a hospitalisation-worthy food poisoning would require, sat upon tins of beans, and soups and other canned goods to last as long as they can in the event that fresh food ceased to exist.  They all prepared for the worst but with the hope that the worst was not quite bad enough that they wouldn‚Äôt be around anymore for their panicked selfishness to pan out.  I didn‚Äôt have to worry about that, however.  I knew something like this would happen soon enough.  I already had the supplies in the shelter underneath the garden that I‚Äôd been sorting for years.  Sure, I had to maintain it and use and restock it when dates eventually became shorter, but I didn‚Äôt need to panic.  I was prepared.
Years spent digging, spending thousands on a nuclear fallout shelter, stocking it, and preparing for the end of the world.  Within a shelter such as this, there is only room for what is most important.  Most of the room was shelving of carefully organised food rations, water, and toiletries.  Sure, I had to forgo some luxuries over the years; holidays and such.  But compared to being alive when the end of the world came about, the decision was easy.  The decision to keep myself and my family alive was one I didn‚Äôt have to think twice about.  I was prepared.

Friends and family laughed when they heard of my spending on the shelter.  
‚ÄúWhat a waste!‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy would you spend all that money for something that will never happen?!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mad!‚Äù
In the face of criticism and laughter, I knew that there was nothing funny about wanting to protect what was most important to me.  I knew that a time would come when all this preparation would be needed.  My family knew too.  They never grumbled or complained.  When friends went on school trips and holidays, and my wife and daughter didn‚Äôt, they didn‚Äôt complain, because I was doing this for them.  Would you rather have luxuries and a short life, or go without and live?  The world out there would need people after whatever would bring it to its knees, and I was prepared.

When the broadcast forced itself onto every channel in the country, interrupting movies, sitcoms, sports and less important news, I know everybody watched.  I stared in quiet horror as the screen flickered to black and white, with aggressive red text in the centre:

‚ÄòGovernment Alert!  
Immediate Threat to Life‚Äô 

It sat in bold across the screen accompanied by a continuous, piercing whine.  Time stood still as I sat in my old, worn leather armchair, cold can of beer slowly warming on the coffee table as I stared, dumbfounded at the television that was about to affirm all my years of work and sacrifice, which deep down, I never wanted to be right about.  The ceaseless whining carried on, cutting through all thought and life.  My sense of reality dissipated as whining noise imprinted itself upon me and my surroundings.  The screen cut to the next message, that surely no human voice could read out clearly at that point in time:

‚ÄòA nuclear strike has been launched by our country's enemies.  Citizens are advised to locate their nearest government shelter immediately.‚Äô

A nuclear strike.
Of all the ways the end could come, this was the worst.  I poured years of life and thousands of pounds into that shelter, but the one thing I was never certain it would hold up against was a nuclear fallout.  Almost ten feet deep, thick steel on all sides, I wasn‚Äôt certain it could hold.  Years of preparation was all about to be put to the test.  The black and white screen flickered and whined its deathly message of the end.  The lives of millions were about to end.  As war and anxiety mounted, and tension got thicker than the blood being spilled across the globe, the government poured billions into shelters across the country for the protection of its citizens.  For the first time since taxes began, no one complained when they skyrocketed; when it was announced that it was for the sole purpose of local fallout shelters, equipped with years of rations, space for hundreds to a shelter, and facilities for life to continue underground until safety above was confirmed.  Yet, in the face of all of the work and money that went into all of this, one question remained; how long would it be until these nuclear bombs hit?  Almost as though the broadcast read my mind, it delivered its final, morbid message that confirmed that hundreds of millions of lives were about to be snuffed out:

‚ÄòMay God have mercy on us all.‚Äô

And with that, the whining stopped.  The message remained, but silence filled the air.  It suffocated everything and sat heavy in the air as one single thought raced through my mind; how long do I have?  There was no way that there would be time to reach a government-built shelter.  Sure it would make mine look like the first little pigs house, easily blown down, compared to the third pigs brick house, but there was no way most people could reach them on time.  So I carried on with my own.
‚ÄúJane!  Get to shelter!  NOW!!‚Äù  I screamed the words in an almost guttural tone as fear and adrenaline kicked in.

What do you save when time is taken away from you?  When in minutes, if not seconds, everything would be fire and ash.  I sprinted out into the garden, knocking over the beer, spilling golden liquid onto the carpet which frothed and foamed white, then soaked into the fabric, leaving a stain that for once, nobody would care about.  Bursting through the door to the garden, the wooden frame rattled angrily as the force shook it almost off its hinges.  Out in the garden, I stood and spun around, staring for signs of the impending apocalypse.
‚ÄúJane!  Hurry up!‚Äù
Not a whiff of wind blew as I twirled on the spot, looking for signs of the end.  Trees stood still as though painted on the canvas of a painting titled ‚ÄòStillness at the End of the World‚Äô.
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Ellie‚Äôs bear?!‚Äù  
This couldn‚Äôt be happening, I had thought.  The world was ending, and my wife was looking for my daughter‚Äôs bear‚Ä¶
What do you save when the world comes to an end?
‚ÄúForget the damn bear!  We need to go, now!‚Äù
Had she not seen the broadcast on the bedroom television?!  What had she been doing?!
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need anything, just grab her and get to the shelter,‚Äù  I shouted back, as sweat began to drip down my brow and into my eyes, stinging them as I scanned the sky for movement.

What do you save when the world comes to an end?

‚ÄúHurry up!‚Äù  I screamed again.  ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!‚Äù
As I waited for signs of my wife and daughter through the kitchen window, rushing toward me stood in the garden, rooted in place, that‚Äôs when I saw it.  As the clouds start to break, curtains of silver-grey draw apart, revealing clear blue skies, one black spec moving through the blue.  The spec moved across the sky and slowly became clearer and larger, with an orange-yellow flame appearing at the back.  There was no mistaking what this was; a messenger of death; a crude, white cylinder of destruction, sent to bring an end to its designated target.  The missile left a grey streak across the blue sky, like a wake left by a ship on the ocean, it unzipped the sky as it streamed overhead, headed toward the city.  As its speed increased as it rapidly got closer to the point I was standing, it soared directly over me, a spec soon to be blown away by its imminent blast.  I heard its sheer power, the thunder of the fuel being burned up at a monumental rate to send it hurtling towards its target as it arrived above the city skyline in the distance in a startlingly small amount of time.  

There was a brief silence as the sound of the missile dissipated moments before it reached its pre-programmed destination, and then, a flash of light so blinding that everything went white, burning my retinas and causing pain to surge through my eyes as though staring directly at the sun.  As the white began to fade, the outline of the city slowly came back into focus, like a sketching being detailed and coloured in by an artist's skilled hand.  Except, covering most of the city and growing larger, an enormous mushroom cloud grew, burning deep shades of oranges and reds, forming a cloud of smoke around it, engulfing everything.  A glutenous, flaming monster, born of a chemical reaction created for maximum death and destruction expanded and climbed ever higher.  Everything around it for miles, would soon be fire and ashes.  We had to go.

The lead-lined steel door of the fallout shelter was cool to the touch.  The finish on it wasn‚Äôt quite smooth, giving it a harsh feel on the palm of my hand, like steel sandpaper.  The wheel in the centre, used to turn the bolts into place was comparable to that of an old galleon, if they had been made of metal rather than wood, like that on a bank vault.  The slight roughness had bitten into my hands and fingers lightly as I had desperately spun them as hard and fast as I could to lock the door in place before the forthcoming force of the initial blast.  In spite of the coolness of the metal against my palms, they were slick with sweat.  Panic and unimaginable fear has caused me to sweat profusely, seeping into my clothes and face.  I could taste the saltiness of my sweat on my lips as I panted near-uncontrollably, gulping in breaths of cold air, tinged with a metallic taste.  

Just then, vibrations started to coarse through my hands and up my forearms, although faint at first, like an off-beat drumming; not soft.  Enough to know there was a force on the other side, but not with the force to trouble the door.  Then, my feet began to tingle.  It was subtle, like the tingle from standing on the spot for too long.  Then, the tingle climbed its way up my leg, creeping up my muscle fibres, under the skin like a parasite as my feet and hands began to shake.  The drumming was replaced by a consistent hammering of the door like a distant pack of panicked wildebeest trampling the ground of the Serengeti.  Rattling of metal began behind me as the shelving units holding all the food, toiletries and other necessities began to shake.  My shoulders started to ache in their sockets as the vibrations became more intense, and my knees started to tremble as the ground my feet were rooted to threatened to open up and swallow me whole like the gaping mouth of a behemoth lay dormant for thousands of years, awoken by a terrible disturbance on the surface.  Rattling became clattering became clanging, as cans and packs were shaken from their carefully organised places and tumbled in midair in short, desperate falls to the floor below before being scattered all around.   Chaos infiltrated the shelter which had been designed for safety and stability as the quake brought down everything inside, reminding me that surviving did not mean living.
	
Dirt and dust descended from above, covering my hair and choking me as I struggled to breathe through it all.  The door was shuddering in its frame, making me fear my work would prove no match for the force against it.  Then, in an instant, the pounding stopped and was replaced with an ungodly roaring surge, and I could have sworn the door was about to be blown from its reinforced hinges and crush me beneath it.  My body rattled like a child‚Äôs plaything from the shaking.  The Rapture was now, and I was about to be judged for my sins as the shelter threatened to cave in and become my tomb, and at this point, I felt myself welcoming it.  Survival couldn‚Äôt possibly be worth what would come after this.  The violence of the force upon the shelter crescendoed as the last of the racks collapsed after rattling across the floor and tipping over the rest of the supplies.  My head throbbed from the effect of it all, the strain of me holding the door which in hindsight, without the lock, frame and hinges, would have flattened me.  Then, as quickly as it had started, it stopped.  Silence encompassed everything as the last bits of dust began to settle around me, the only movement was my own shadow eerily dancing infront of me, an apocalyptic spectre swaying in front of me as though it were trapped inside and searching for any means of escape through the shelter door.  It was obvious that anything and everything on the other side of the shelter door would be dead.

As the inertia of the blast passes, exhaustion and pain takes over, I collapse to the floor.  I can‚Äôt believe that it has actually happened.  We had spent years of our lives planning for it, but for it to have actually happened, feels completely surreal.  I‚Äôm in a nightmare from which there ‚Äòs no waking.  I can‚Äôt stand.  I can't think.  I just sit there in a stupor, staring up at the door which was both my saviour and my captor, looming over me, almost mocking me as it knew that to open it now meant almost certain death.  I can‚Äôt bear to look at it, knowing what‚Äôs on the other side now.  I crawl away from it, deeper into the shelter, feeling meek and hollow.  Debris from the quake grazes my palms and fingers, dirtying the knees of my jeans.  I sit up against the wall at the bottom of the small set of stairs that leads down from the entrance, and survey what‚Äôs to be home for the next month.  What had once been so neat and organised, has become the site you might expect after a storm.  The shelving units, that until recently, had stood tall and strong, with rows of neatly packed cans of various food from beans to stews and vegetables to soups, all indicated by the sticky labels penned beneath each lie atop oneanother, the cans mixed amongst each other.  Packs of toiletries and medicines scattered in a separate section, held down under the racks that once housed them.

With a restrained groan of effort, I get to my feet and walk among the wreckage of the storage section of the shelter.  I grab one of the racks and lift it back into an upright position, and I read its labels; tinned tomatoes, corn, peas, and other vegetables.  Searching the mess with my eyes, I spot a couple cans that match the description and bend to pick them up.  A can of peas with one side dented in and part of its label torn sits in my hand as I weigh it up, Ellie didn‚Äôt even like peas.  So why did I buy so many?

How could this have actually happened?

I begin to question whether this had even been worth building in the first place.  To protect my family?  From what?  Instant, painless vaporization, purely to then live in suffering for however long the shelter grants us?  

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

The can rolls slowly to the edges of my fingertips before it attains a new dent as it falls back to the floor as my arm loosely drops to my side whilst I stand lifeless among the mess.  

‚ÄúYes, sweetie?!‚Äù

Light and shadow dances across the room as the bulbs still swing quietly, suspended from the ceiling.  Some of them hang lower than the others and swing in a different tempo, adding layers to the dance, making the room seem larger, then smaller, wider, then narrower as my mind plays its tricks.  Ellie‚Äôs shadow runs across the shelter, but she hasn‚Äôt moved an inch.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared.‚Äù

Just then, as the yellow hues of the bulbs sway, a quiet thumping starts up.  I glance over my shoulder as a bead of sweat drips down from my brow to my chin, leaving a trail through the thin layer of dirt that covered my face from the quake just moments ago, joining others as they descend from my stubble, struggle to hold on and drip silently to the floor.  Staring back the way I had come, the low thumping continues.  I turn my whole body and take slow imprecise steps back towards the entrance.

‚ÄúDaddy, don't leave us.‚Äù

The sound draws me in as I barely register Ellie‚Äôs voice.  Dirt and debris crunch beneath my feet and cans rattle and my footsteps sweep them aside.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt, baby girl.‚Äù

There‚Äôs no conceivable way that anything living could be causing that noise.

Thump. Thump.

Thump.

Thump thump thump.

As I approach the door, the thumping grows in intensity and volume.  Pounding with unimaginable fury, the door rattles and metal groans.  Whatever is on the other side of that door, it seems as though it could break through at any moment.

‚ÄúDaddy! I‚Äôm Scared!‚Äù

Dust begins to fall again as the pounding intensifies.

THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP.

THUMP!  THUMP!  THUMP!

The shadows cast by the warm yellow ceiling lights blitz across the door, making it look like the door is alive as the shadow of a figure, me, grows in size as I get closer.  My shadow shakes across the metal indentations and bolts as I lift my arm towards it, reaching out, figures fully extended.  The thumping is almost deafening now.

‚ÄúDAAAAD!!!‚Äù

My phantom fingers stretch across the door.  Towards the bolt mechanism that holds the door in place.  That holds everything inside in, and everything outside, out.  The other shadows race across the walls and door, panicked, a flurry of black lines and curves, warped and out of shape as light plays with their forms, curving and twisting, racing this way and back, crossing over each other, a mangled display of tormented figures.  The shadow of my fingers appear unaffected now by the crazed swinging and jumping of the lights behind me, completely stable and unshaken, like a trained surgeon's hand weidling a scalpel mere millimetres from a beating heart.  My fingers reach the handle, the faintest of touches, as the pounding at the door erupts to an even greater, unbearable level.  A blood-curdling scream pierces through everything, so high and horrific that would turn the strongest of stomachs, as the lights in the shelter explode all at once.  Darkness costumes everything within.

Silence.

Nothing moves within.

Nothing moves outside.

‚ÄúEllie?  Jane?‚Äù  I whisper so low that I question if it‚Äôs even audible.

No response.

I feel entirely alone.  
If it weren‚Äôt for the beating of my heart, I would presume myself dead, waiting to ascend, or sink.  I reach one nervous, shaking hand in front of me, and one to my side, finding purchase on the wall of the shelter.  I‚Äôm still here.

‚ÄúJane?‚Äù

No response.

‚ÄúEllie?  Baby girl?‚Äù  

No response.

I etch my feet forward, scrapping the soles of my shoes along the floor, trying to find the steps to descend further into the darkness that envelops me and everything else.  Some say that a fear of the dark is irrational, that darkness can‚Äôt hurt you, as it is simply a lack of light and nothing more.  We simply take comfort in being able to see what is around us.  We fear what lies within the darkness, what takes shape and waits for us at our most defenceless.  It‚Äôs instinctual, primal.  Fire was our most significant invention because it allowed us to overcome the darkness.  Even if we know what is around us, in the darkness, doubt creeps in.  A perfectly sane person sitting in a room empty of anything except themselves, knows that if the light goes out, they are still the only thing in that room.  But how do they know that?  Because there was nothing there when it was lit?  How do they know nothing has changed?  If there is no light, they cannot see.  If they cannot see, they cannot know now for certain.  I know what is in the shelter.  I organised it myself.  I built it.  I filled it.  I entered it knowing what was inside in its entirety.  I know what is in here with me.  Don‚Äôt I?

As I descend the steps, feet sliding to the end of each moulded concrete step before carefully finding connection with the next, my fingers brush along the walls, and my hand shakes out in front of me despite knowing the first thing that would be in front of me is still a ways off.  It‚Äôs completely silent within except for my short irregular breaths.  How long have I been descending the steps?  I built this place myself, brick by brick, pouring in the concrete mixture and letting it set.  I know how long it is, how wide it is, and how deep it is.  Yet it feels like I have been descending the steps for eternity, time drawn out as I go further into the depths of darkness.  
The effects of whatever was used outside must have caused an immense heat, as the shelter feels stuffy and warm.  I could swear that I‚Äôm sweating more than ever, the taste of my salt on my lips.  My hand leaves the side of the wall as I reach the final step.  My foot comes down gingerly and the sole of my shoes finds faint resistance that almost instantly gives way as a crunch fills the air from the breaking off a fragment of bulb, the hairs of my forearm raising to stand on end.  

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

At the sound of her voice, I rush forward towards the sound, forgetting the mess that the blast of the strike created as I put almost my entire weight on a rogue can that shoots out from underneath me, sending me straight forward and down to the ground.  My outstretched hands save me from the impact of the fall, but at the cost of their skins as fragments of glass pierce them all over, passing through layers of skin, burying themselves into my flesh as I curse.  Knelt in the remains of the glass bulbs I raise my hands in futility, unable to inspect the damage they received.  Carefully, the fingertips of one hand trace over the other as I remove the fragments I can remove, extracting them from each as they take a little of me with each fragment.  As I remove the last fragment, I know that the chaos I was within was no longer my well organised shelter that I knew inside out.  I needed light so that I didn‚Äôt fall over something else and do some real damage.  Rising, I scrape my feet along the floor, causing scratching and crunching sounds as my feet dragged the debris along, sweeping through cans and glass alike as I head toward the direction of the bathroom section.  
Waving my arms in an arc in front of me to aid in preventing any further injury, floating particles of dust and dirt stinging my fresh cuts, I find the doorframe leading into the bathroom.  A delicate thread brushes my outstretched fingers.  I swipe at it and grasp the string for the bathroom light and yank.  Light fills the room, revealing the sterile looking metal basin and the open medicine cupboard above it right in front of me.  The light flickers erratically as I take stock of the bathroom.  An unwelcoming looking toilet and depressing looking shower with a cheap plastic curtain in one corner, with another mess of scattered toiletries around them.  I never made the place to be a five-star hotel, it was built for survival, but I can‚Äôt deny the harshness of it.  I turn back to the sink and remove the various medicines and toothpastes which have fallen from the cabinet above it, and begin to put them back in place, the blood mixed with dirt from my wounds smears across everything as I notice a sealed pack of bandages.  I place them to one side and put everything else back.  I turn the tap and to my mild relief, watch the water flow from the faucet and began to wash my hands and inspect the wounds; they‚Äôre not great, but it could have been a lot worse.  I methodically wrap the bandages around my hands and tie them tight, putting the rest of the roll away.  I close the cabinet doors and see Jane reflected in the dirty glass of the mirror standing behind me in the main area of the shelter.  As soon as I see her, the bulb sparks and dies out, the darkness once more claiming everything.

Quickly crouching down, I open the other cupboard that‚Äôs beneath it and frantically search for one of the torches I placed there in case of this very scenario.  The effects of the strike must have shorted the electrics everywhere, including the generator I had put up.  Finding the torch, I spin and flick the switch, shooting out a beam of cold white light through the doorway, but Jane is no longer standing there.

‚ÄúJane?‚Äù

No response.

She was right there.  Where did she go?  I call out again but hear only myself.  Particles of dust dance through the beam of light I use to cut through the darkness, over the mess of the racks and cans and other objects thrown from their places.  Rushing into the room, careful this time of where my feet land, I scan the shelter with torch in hand.  Shadows play once more across the walls as my search for my family continues.  The beds lie empty and stillness is all around except for the shadows.  Then, I see them, eyes reflected in the light of the torch.  Huddled in the corner, Ellie and Jane sit, crouched down, Jane‚Äôs arms wrapped tightly around Ellie.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing in the corner?  It‚Äôs alright now, you‚Äôre safe,‚Äù  I say gently as I make my way over to them.
‚ÄúYou left us,‚Äù Jane says, whimpering slightly, clutching Ellie to her chest.
‚ÄúThe lights broke, I needed to get the torch.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe were so afraid.  It all went dark, and it hurt.‚Äù
The glass fragments must have hit them when they all exploded.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright now, we‚Äôll clean you both up and sort out this mess.‚Äù
I reach out toward them, the hairs on my arms standing on end again.  Shivers shoot up my spine.  Pins and needles shoot down my legs.
‚ÄúYou left us.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo.  I‚Äôm here now.‚Äù
‚ÄúDaddy.‚Äù Ellie sobs into Jane‚Äôs chest.
‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs here, baby.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Jane sobs.
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù  I reply, concerned and confused.
As I reach closer, my fingertips tingle and sting.  The torchlight flickers, the light reflects intensely in their eyes, almost growing brighter than the torch itself.
‚ÄúCoward,‚Äù Jane sobs.

A loud rumble starts up from the entrance.  As I spin and aim the torch at it, an ungodly explosion erupts, and dust bursts through the thin lines between the door and frame on all sides as the door almost comes off its hinges.  Two screams echo throughout the shelter and I whip back to the two of them to see them holding each other tighter than ever, the screams coming from them, almost deafening me.  I reach out to comfort them, protect them.
As my fingers touch Jane‚Äôs hair, it burns my fingers as though I had just touched fire itself.  Their screams stopped without dying down, like a speaker playing music turned off in the middle of a song, as her eyes met mine.  Fire erupted in her eyes like the explosion of a star dying out, a supernova brighter than the sun itself.  Their very skin began to glow and emanate an intense heat that dried out my mouth that was agape in horror as their skin turned from deep orange to blood red, their clothes burning around them, falling away like fragments of burnt embers from a bonfire.  Still staring at Jane‚Äôs face, the light in her eyes burned out leaving scorched sockets as they collapsed in on themselves, turning to ash on the ground.
‚ÄúGirls?‚Ä¶‚Äù I whimper pathetically.
I reach into the ashes weakly, still warm and staining my hands black, trying in vain to pull them back from within the pile.  Tears streaming down my face, I sit back and stare at the door and see it.  A black mark scorched into the metal of the door itself.  It was the shape of how they sat just moments ago;  huddled together in a final embrace.

They were never in the shelter.

The missile struck.

I panicked.

I fled for the shelter, and seeing the growing destruction, I shut the door before they had got there.

Coward.

What do you save when the world comes to an end?

I saved myself.

I spent days off, sacrificed holidays, used savings, all to ultimately protect myself.  I sacrificed so much, and ended up sacrificing my own family.  I place one hand on the scorch marks.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù
What good is sorry?
I stand up and walk over to one of the beds, glass crunching under my steps, and sit slowly down on the edge.  Placing the torch down, I reach under the bed and feel the smooth varnished wood of a small box, pick it up, and place it beside me.
What good is a shelter if it doesn‚Äôt protect what you want to protect?
I take my keys from my jeans pocket and find the small key that will fit the little gold-plated keyhole under the lid and unlock it.  I open the box and stare at the revolver within.
Like the shelter, it was meant for protection.
My burnt fingers wrap around the grip of the revolver.

I cock it and raise it up, placing the end of the barrel under my chin.

What‚Äôs the point of living if you have nothing to live for?

I pull the trigger.

By Neverwas


You take the path behind the broken sign.
No name, no map, no trailhead-
Just soft dirt and the smell of pool chlorine.

The trees blink when you aren‚Äôt looking, 
And the fish take notes on your thoughts.
The sky exhales smoke that tastes like cr√®me br√ªl√©e,
Sweetened with the voices that beg you to vomit.

You‚Äôve been here before.
Under a different name.
You walk along the trail made of distorted dates.

Look down-  your feet walk backwards.
A playground that never saw children. 
The lake watches you intently,
You do not recognize the bodies in the water.

Then you see it- 
Beneath the sky rusted over with salt water,
Resting in the shade of the choir of vending machines, 

A heap of mouths, eyes, hands, teeth, fingers-
Stitched together like a rumor.
It hums in a thousand thousand voices.
It blinks in repeated codes of silence. 
Limbs thrash about grasping at unseen butterflies, plastic straws, and pens.
Pens.
Pens.
Pens.

You greet it with a beverage and a lawn chair:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while now. Seven years right?‚Äù
Hesitations prod your throat with walking sticks.
‚ÄúDo you remember me?‚Äù

It speaks:

‚ÄúYesterday was full of temporal abnormalities.
Your dog was made of slip space ruptures.
Your mother folded the afternoon into a jar.‚Äù

A mouth in its shoulder mutters:
‚ÄúClocks taste better when afraid.
The barbershop pole read sentences upside down all day.
The laundry mat across the street now services mattresses.‚Äù

Another eye blinks sideways:
‚ÄúYou left the door inside the cupboard.
The sky forgave you for the chair.
‚ÄúScenic picture of a dead body in the office computer room.‚Äù

A palm opens across its chest,
Holding nothing but the word:
‚ÄúConglomeration.‚Äù

You smile to yourself.
‚ÄúYes, I always loved the way Mondays would bend into bananas and old fence posts.‚Äù

It gargles through molars on its back.

‚ÄúThree lemon Thursdays ago, you left the window open and the bees recited scriptures from your skin.
The teeth in the cereal box said goodbye in twelve dialects of a dripping sink faucet.‚Äù

You laugh sincerely.
‚ÄúAh yes, the county fair.
When my aunt made fireworks from brown gravy and screaming tomatoes.‚Äù

A twitching ear murmurs:
‚ÄúThe emperor lies frozen deep in the recesses of your freezer.
A tree sapling grew from the oil filter of your father‚Äôs sports car you crashed at the shooting range.‚Äù

You blink.
‚ÄúThe horse, yeah‚Ä¶ I almost forgot.
We buried the saddle, not the body.‚Äù

An open sore on its head howls:
‚ÄúWild chickens in the curtains. Orange blossoms that screamed. And your sister, she ascended the pillar?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was destined to,‚Äù you say proudly.

A limb folds inwards, an eye rolls down a broken spine.
A foot births new fingers, a broken leg makes way for a wrist.

‚ÄúYou remember a party, there was no party.‚Äù

You pause.
‚ÄúWas that‚Ä¶ the night of the static storm?
But‚Ä¶ I remember cake.‚Äù

A twisted nose breathes in response,
‚ÄúA store bought cake, not for you.
For someone else.‚Äù

Your voice falters,
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ no! That‚Äôs not what happened.
It was my birth-‚Äú

A bent kneecap cuts you off.
‚ÄúShe was scared, she told you she was scared.
You turned on the TV to drown her out.
The cheers came from it, not her.
She stood behind you.‚Äù

Your voice catches on a sob that never comes.
A hundred fingers twitch in sequence,
‚ÄúNo one read your apology.
You didn‚Äôt send it.
You only rehearsed it until it felt real.‚Äù

You try to respond, your words die before their conception.
‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt abandon you, you left before they could,
She never said she loved you, you just wanted her to.‚Äù

Its many voices fall quiet.
The vending machines hold their breath.
It leans closer- 
Lips of skinless knuckles brush against your face:
‚ÄúDid you visit the lamppost today?‚Äù

The taste of bitter black coffee shivers down your back.
Something behind your eyes wilts. 
You feel her shadow stretch across your lungs. 
She now hides behind your teeth. 

One of its mouths, smaller than the rest,
Whispers from somewhere within:
‚ÄúYou keep feeding me these memories,
Hoping that I‚Äôll chew them into truths.‚Äù

You say nothing.

‚ÄúYou long for a time that never existed,
You created the warmth because the cold was honest.
Why do you come back here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù You say

Stillness captures the air, pockets of nothing in a sea of barking dogs.
Something stirs in its stomach, digested sacks of unspoken thoughts.

A choir of laughter erupts- choking, shrieking, giddy  with rot. 
‚ÄúYou brought me here, created me, to lie to you.‚Äù
You try to speak-
‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve remembered how to speak the truth.‚Äù

You drop to your knees.
Not from the weight, but from its absence. 
Your breath hiccups through shame, 
Something inside you begs to be erased.

The vending machines hum with wedding bells.
The air reeks of plastic and lilies.

A veil moves in the corners of your eyes. 

You don‚Äôt look at her.
You don‚Äôt dare.
You can‚Äôt. 

She speaks behind your ribs,
Where your heart used to be:

‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù
‚ÄúPretend this helps.‚Äù

First off, the LOOT! My oh my is the loot in this game awesome. I'm a massive loot-whore, love Fallouts and all that and this game's loot is some of the most satisfying. It's nicely spaced out so you get new shit in nice intervals. And there's SO MANY GUNS, LOVE IT!

The gunplay is excellent when it works and absolute infuriating when it doesn't. This will get better as the patches keep coming I'm sure, but for now it's fine for the most part.

The world is absolutely breath-taking; I'm running a R5 7600 with a 9070 non-XT and at 1440p, maxed out with FSR on native AA, I get 60+FPS for the most part, but get heavy drops in bigger cities, which is fine usually. The bigger battles are annoying though when you need to try shooting a bunch of assholes with your framerate in the 40s. This, too, will most likely improve with the patches, or so I hope.

The voice-acting, in english, is.. passable. Many familiar voices from KCD2, I think they just hired the whole team from them lol. Would love to play in Ukrainian, but I just don't want to read all the time. Maybe I'll switch it for a while and see how I like it.

The A-life seems to not be working at all, I don't know, maybe it works a little here and there, but I get constant spawns in front of me all the time while traversing. Annoying. Also the AI in general is just.. awfully basic.

The story is whatever, to be honest, I haven't been paying that close attention to it, it seems passable, but it's not pulling me in, like at all.

All in all, having so much fun, I usually don't get hooked on games these days at this age (30+) but this game has me loading up pretty much as soon as I pour my morning-coffee. Can't wait for them to actually finish this game and play it again then.

But then last night i got an email from another restaurant I applied to just simply saying something like ""we'd love to meet you- your job interview is scheduled tomorrow at X time""

the time is several hours before my other one and they gave me absolutely no option to reschedule. They said it can only be today at this date and time so I must simply accept or decline. Even though they had already scheduled it for me on my behalf without even asking me if I'm available today. 

I accepted it anyway because I didn't want to lose this job opportunity. I really want a job. I've been looking for my first job for two years and still no job.

I knew it was gonna be tight, but I didn't know it was gonna be this tight.

Now this first interview is in two in a half hours and there's no transportation until another hour and a half. I'm barely going to make it to the first one and that's only if it's on time. If there's any delays, I'm going to be late.

I cannot afford rideshare. I only have $5 in my pocket.

1lod9o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicbusiness/comments/1lod9o4/do_you_make_a_living_as_a_small_independent/,"Do you make a living as a small, independent online rapper?","Yes, you can‚Äîand honestly should‚Äîmake money from rap. Of course, there‚Äôs a big difference between doing rap for the money, and doing rap and earning money from it. I fall into the latter category. I‚Äôve been doing this for over 20 years, but only recently I started thinking: why not make some income from it while I‚Äôm at it? I mean, painters sell their art too. I love rap, and if I can also make money from it, I‚Äôll love it even more.

And no, that doesn‚Äôt kill the ""artistic"" side of it‚Äîin fact, it makes it stronger. When you don‚Äôt have to waste your time doing some soul-sucking day job, and instead can focus fully on your passion, that‚Äôs when real creativity happens.

I‚Äôve been posting homemade short rap videos on social media for a while now, mostly on TikTok. It‚Äôs fun, and I‚Äôd love to turn it into a full-time thing.

I‚Äôve got a link hub (like Linktree) that includes all my platforms, plus donation links (like Buy Me a Coffee). I haven‚Äôt gotten much in donations yet, but hopefully that‚Äôll change in the future.

I mostly post freestyle videos‚Äîusually recorded at home and uploaded as-is. The quality isn‚Äôt anything groundbreaking, but they still get decent views. Sometimes when I‚Äôm out at bars or events, I freestyle to random people, and we film it. That content always performs way better than my low-effort living room raps.

Right now I‚Äôm trying to figure out ways to level this up as a career and find new creative ways to monetize my visibility‚Äîwithout going overboard with commercialism.

Selling merch is one popular option, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very profitable unless you‚Äôre already big. My dream would be to start a proper hip-hop clothing brand‚Äînot just shirts with my artist name slapped on them. But I‚Äôm a small-town underground rapper, so I doubt it would really take off right away.

I'm also interested in starting some side businesses that I can promote through my content. I‚Äôm business-minded, with a background in sales and marketing. You just can‚Äôt make much money from music alone ‚Äî you need to broaden your repertoire.

I guess a lot of people hate the idea of being some kind of social media influencer when all they really want to do is focus on music. But I actually enjoy it. I'm passionate about marketing ‚Äî especially social media marketing ‚Äî and I get a real kick out of watching the stats and seeing how different content performs.

Even though, most of the time, I end up scratching my head wondering how messed up the algorithms are. Somehow, some of my crappiest videos get the most attention, while the dopest stuff barely gets seen.

Of course, Spotify and TikTok do pay for views/streams, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthose are pennies. As a small artist, it‚Äôs not enough to live off.

Is there anyone out here who‚Äôs actually ""made it"" as an independent, small-scale online rap artist? I truly believe it‚Äôs possible‚Äîeven with a small follower count. The key is engagement. Almost all my TikTok followers are people I met randomly in real life‚Äîat bars, events, whatever‚Äîand I just asked them to follow me. So most of them feel like real friends, and they even tell others about me.

Especially since I‚Äôm pretty much the ""only"" rapper in my small town, people are hyped that I‚Äôm repping the place hard and putting us on the map in my own way. They love being part of the journey.

So is anyone out here making a living doing exactly this‚Äîno live gigs, just online grind as an indie rapper without millions of followers? Let's forget production side like selling beats, samples etc. I do only rapping, so let's talk only about that guys. I‚Äôm looking for ideas on how to create consistent passive income from this. I really believe it‚Äôs all possible, if you‚Äôve got enough creativity. And if anyone‚Äôs got that, it‚Äôs us rappers‚Äîright?

I‚Äôm open to commercial collabs too (within reason, and not spamming my feed with millions of random brands). Donations, merch, Patreon, etc., are probably the most common ways to earn a little something. Also, I‚Äôve been thinking about offering a service where I could coach aspiring rappers. For example, they could send me their tracks, and I‚Äôd give them feedback and ideas for improvement, for a fee of course. Things like custom-made verses or commissioned songs could be part of it too. But feel free to drop more ideas. Tips and advice are always welcome.

Networking is one of my top priorities, so feel free to hit me up if you want to chat about anything rap-related or share your stuff for me to check out.

I don‚Äôt rap in English myself ‚Äî at least not yet ‚Äî but I mainly listen to English-language rap (actually, I‚Äôm down to hear rap from anywhere ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt matter if I understand the lyrics or not. I just think it‚Äôs dope to hear rap from unexpected places, like Greenland for example \[which is actually dope as fuck\]), and I‚Äôd love to hear your work and exchange ideas.

I‚Äôm 26, happily taken, and while I‚Äôve been enjoying the area, I‚Äôve been finding it a little tough to make new connections and friendships out here.

I was unfortunately injured during my first week at a new job, and I‚Äôm currently in the long, slow process of waiting for back surgery later this year. That‚Äôs definitely slowed me down a bit, but I‚Äôm still eager to get out, meet people, and explore where I can.

A bit about me ‚Äî I love coffee, going on walks, live music, trying new food spots, and (when my body cooperates) hiking. I also used to do some modeling and fashion shows back in Florida, which I really enjoyed ‚Äî it gave me a great creative outlet and community.

Back in Florida, Kava bars were my go-to social spot, and I‚Äôve been missing that kind of relaxed, welcoming vibe here.

If anyone has recs for chill spots to hang, or if you‚Äôre just open to meeting up for a coffee or a slow walk, I‚Äôd love to connect!

Thanks in advance ‚ú®

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

We‚Äôve been friends for years, and I‚Äôve always been generous, but lately I started adding it up and realized she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to pay me back for over $500 worth of stuff in the past year.
She always has an excuse: lost her card, waiting on a paycheck, thought she already paid me. Meanwhile, she‚Äôs posting new outfits, takeout, etc.

1lod7g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/rappers/comments/1lod7g6/do_you_make_a_living_as_a_small_independent/,"Do you make a living as a small, independent online rapper?","Yes, you *can*‚Äîand honestly *should*‚Äîmake money from rap. Of course, there‚Äôs a big difference between doing rap ***for*** the money, and doing rap **and** *earning* money from it. I fall into the latter category. I‚Äôve been doing this for over 20 years, but only recently I started thinking: why not make some income from it while I‚Äôm at it? I mean, painters sell their art too. I love rap, and if I can also make money from it, I‚Äôll love it even more.

And no, that doesn‚Äôt kill the ""artistic"" side of it‚Äîin fact, it makes it stronger. When you don‚Äôt have to waste your time doing some soul-sucking day job, and instead can focus fully on your passion, that‚Äôs when real creativity happens.

I‚Äôve been posting homemade short rap videos on social media for a while now, mostly on TikTok. It‚Äôs fun, and I‚Äôd love to turn it into a full-time thing.

I‚Äôve got a link hub (like Linktree) that includes all my platforms, plus donation links (like Buy Me a Coffee). I haven‚Äôt gotten much in donations yet, but hopefully that‚Äôll change in the future.

I mostly post freestyle videos‚Äîusually recorded at home and uploaded as-is. The quality isn‚Äôt anything groundbreaking, but they still get decent views. Sometimes when I‚Äôm out at bars or events, I freestyle to random people, and we film it. That content always performs way better than my low-effort living room raps.

Right now I‚Äôm trying to figure out ways to level this up as a career and find new creative ways to monetize my visibility‚Äî*without* going overboard with commercialism.

Selling merch is one popular option, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very profitable unless you‚Äôre already big. My dream would be to start a proper hip-hop clothing brand‚Äînot just shirts with my artist name slapped on them. But I‚Äôm a small-town underground rapper, so I doubt it would really take off right away.

I'm also interested in starting some side businesses that I can promote through my content. I‚Äôm business-minded, with a background in sales and marketing. You just can‚Äôt make much money from music alone ‚Äî you need to broaden your repertoire.

I guess a lot of people hate the idea of being some kind of social media influencer when all they really want to do is focus on music. But I actually enjoy it. I'm passionate about marketing ‚Äî especially social media marketing ‚Äî and I get a real kick out of watching the stats and seeing how different content performs.

Even though, most of the time, I end up scratching my head wondering how messed up the algorithms are. Somehow, some of my crappiest videos get the most attention, while the dopest stuff barely gets seen.

Of course, Spotify and TikTok do pay for views/streams, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthose are pennies. As a small artist, it‚Äôs not enough to live off.

Is there *anyone* out here who‚Äôs actually ""made it"" as an independent, small-scale online rap artist? I truly believe it‚Äôs possible‚Äîeven with a small follower count. The key is engagement. Almost all my TikTok followers are people I met randomly in real life‚Äîat bars, events, whatever‚Äîand I just asked them to follow me. So most of them feel like real friends, and they even tell others about me.

Especially since I‚Äôm pretty much the ""only"" rapper in my small town, people are hyped that I‚Äôm repping the place hard and putting us on the map in my own way. They love being part of the journey.

So is anyone out here making a living doing exactly this‚Äîno live gigs, just online grind as an indie rapper without millions of followers? Let's forget production side like selling beats, samples etc. I do only rapping, so let's talk only about that guys. I‚Äôm looking for ideas on how to create consistent passive income from this. I really believe it‚Äôs all possible, if you‚Äôve got enough creativity. And if anyone‚Äôs got that, it‚Äôs us rappers‚Äîright?

I‚Äôm open to commercial collabs too (within reason, and not spamming my feed with millions of random brands). Donations, merch, Patreon, etc., are probably the most common ways to earn a little something. Also, I‚Äôve been thinking about offering a service where I could coach aspiring rappers. For example, they could send me their tracks, and I‚Äôd give them feedback and ideas for improvement, for a fee of course. Things like custom-made verses or commissioned songs could be part of it too. But feel free to drop more ideas. Tips and advice are always welcome.

Networking is one of my top priorities, so feel free to hit me up if you want to chat about anything rap-related or share your stuff for me to check out.

I don‚Äôt rap in English myself ‚Äî at least not yet ‚Äî but I mainly listen to English-language rap (actually, I‚Äôm down to hear rap from anywhere ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt matter if I understand the lyrics or not. I just think it‚Äôs dope to hear rap from unexpected places, like Greenland for example \[which is actually dope as fuck\]), and I‚Äôd love to hear your work and exchange ideas.

Lucas Myers was having an affair.

Charlotte Porter stood outside the CEO's office, her body numb with shock. The black stilettos she wore seemed to merge with the dark-veined marble beneath her feet.

After a long moment, she finally raised her hand and knocked.

""Come in.""

A deep voice answered from within.

Charlotte tightened her grip on the files in her hand before pushing the door open.

The moment she entered, she forced a polite smile and approached his desk. ""Do you have a minute? These documents need your signature.""

Though she phrased it as a question, the files were already placed before him, opened to the necessary pages.

Lucas had just returned from a business trip to the Alps that morning.

He had gone straight to the office, and his desk was already buried under paperwork. His aristocratic features showed signs of fatigue as he signed without reading.

""Thanks.""

Charlotte collected the signed documents and asked casually, ""Will you be home for dinner tonight?""

""I have plans. Don‚Äôt wait up,"" he replied without looking up.

""Understood.""

She turned on her heel, her smile hardening into something colder the moment her back was to him.

As she passed the private lounge, she caught a faint rustling‚Äîlike someone scrambling off the bed. Her gaze flicked to the sofa, where snack wrappers and a half-finished iced latte littered the coffee table. A lone pale pink stiletto lay abandoned on the floor...

The realization hit her like a punch to the gut.

Charlotte returned to her office, the short walk leaving her drained. Sinking into her chair, she exhaled sharply, exhaustion pressing down on her.

She pulled a single document from the stack.

The divorce papers.

Flipping to the last page, she traced his signature with bitter amusement. Memories flashed through her mind‚Äîhis passionate vows, his mother‚Äôs icy warning that no man stays faithful, her own naive insistence that they were different...

What a joke.

He‚Äôd taken his mistress on his business trip.

And now, he‚Äôd brought her straight to the office.

She snapped a photo of his signature and sent it to his mother: Done.

A week ago, they‚Äôd struck a deal.

His mother wanted the divorce kept quiet. In return, Charlotte demanded a billion dollars.

In one month, Lucas Myers would be out of her life for good.

Knock knock‚Äî

Charlotte tucked the papers away. ""Come in.""

Micah Murphy, Lucas‚Äôs assistant, stepped inside.

""Ms. Porter, the CEO asked me to give you this."" He placed an emerald-green velvet box on her desk.

She opened it without interest. Inside lay an extravagant diamond set‚Äîundoubtedly costly. But all she could picture was a disheveled girl in a bathrobe, carelessly toying with a necklace, love bites visible in the dim light.

Her stomach turned.

""Thank you, Micah.""

Her sharp gaze made him flinch.

He added nervously, ""The CEO picked it himself. It‚Äôs unique.""

Too bad he wasn‚Äôt.

She didn‚Äôt want it.

Charlotte smiled sweetly. ""How thoughtful‚Äîfinding time to shop with such a busy schedule.""

Something in her tone made Micah sweat. Does she know about the CEO and Ms. Guzman...?

He hurried out.

Charlotte stared at the jewelry with disgust, as if it were tainted. She took a photo and sent it to a luxury reseller: Sell it. Donate the proceeds to the Special Needs Children‚Äôs Foundation.

# Chapter 2 - A Fracture in the Dawn

The Parking Garage

Charlotte Porter had just reached her car when her gaze caught on the vehicle opposite hers, its engine already humming. Through the window, she saw Lucas Myers in the backseat, pressed close to a girl with a pixie cut and a face full of youthful charm.

""Mr. Myers‚Äî!"" Micah Murphy hit the brakes hard.

Their eyes met through the glass‚Äîhis dark and unreadable, hers hollow and cold. The air in the garage turned thick.

The girl, noticing Charlotte, didn‚Äôt pull away. Instead, she draped her arms around Lucas‚Äôs neck, whispering something in his ear. The sight burned like salt in a wound.

Charlotte looked away, slid into her car, and drove off without a backward glance.

Back home, she had barely stepped into her walk-in closet when she heard another car pull up outside. As she removed her necklace, Lucas‚Äôs presence loomed behind her‚Äîhis scent, heavy and possessive, filling the space as he braced his hands on the cabinet, studying her reflection. ""Are you angry?""

She didn‚Äôt turn. Carefully placing the necklace back, she replied, cold as steel, ""Furious enough to make you sleep with one eye open.""

Lucas was silent for a beat. ""The Wellingtons want in on the Polaris project. I‚Äôve been negotiating with Edward Wellington. The girl‚Äôs his sister.""

""So if you don‚Äôt entertain her, the deal‚Äôs off?""

""Charlotte, I‚Äôm explaining. Don‚Äôt twist my words.""

""Save it."" She finally faced him, her stare sharp enough to draw blood. ""If you‚Äôre done with me and want to replace the lady of this house, I‚Äôll step aside.""

His expression darkened. ""What did you just say?""

She exhaled. ""I said we can get a divorce.""

She pushed past him, but he yanked her back, gripping her chin. ""Don‚Äôt even think about it.""

Charlotte said nothing.

She‚Äôd already thought about it.

Already decided.

She was done.

Lucas stayed until late before another call dragged him away. Charlotte heard the soft, pleading voice on the other end.

The next morning, Gabriela Duncan‚Äîher divorce lawyer and oldest friend‚Äîsent a screenshot: Lucas‚Äôs little girlfriend‚Äôs latest post. A photo of two hands forming a heart against a sunrise, captioned: Feeling your heartbeat in the dawn.

Charlotte recognized Lucas‚Äôs hand instantly.

She sat there, clutching her glass until her knuckles whitened. When she finally set it down, the sharp clink was the sound of another fracture in her resolve.

Days passed. Lucas didn‚Äôt come home.

They only crossed paths in boardrooms‚Äîhim at the head of the table, her among the executives, their gazes never meeting.

Charlotte didn‚Äôt seek him out.

Instead, she filled her time house-hunting and selling off his gifts‚Äîanniversaries, birthdays, Valentines, even her wedding ring.

Why keep tokens of a love she‚Äôd outgrown?

That evening, Harper Lee, owner of Velvet Lounge, invited her out.

It was nearly midnight, and she hesitated. But knowing she‚Äôd need connections after leaving Summit Group, she went.

The moment she stepped inside, she spotted Harper.

# Chapter 3 - A Cold Reckoning in the Lavish Room

Harper Lee linked her arm affectionately through Charlotte's as they entered the elevator. ""I was worried you'd get lost, sis. First time here, right?""

That much was true‚Äîthis place was completely unfamiliar.

Upstairs, Harper guided her into a lavish private room split by an ornate Victorian-style divider. The lively chatter from the other side was unmistakable, but Harper steered her toward the quieter section where a single woman sat. The woman looked vaguely familiar‚Äîlikely the girlfriend of one of Lucas's friends.

Recognition flashed across the woman's face, her smile stiffening before she forced politeness. Charlotte shrugged off her coat and took a seat, sipping the coffee handed to her as the rowdy conversation beyond the divider escalated. Then, unexpectedly, the topic shifted to her.

""So, Lucas doesn‚Äôt bring Charlotte around anymore, huh?""

""Obviously. Arya‚Äôs young and cute‚Äîhe parades her everywhere like some prized possession.""

""About time he switched things up.""

""Charlotte‚Äôs stunning, but eight years is enough to tire of anyone.""

""Poor girl. Wasted all that time just to get tossed aside. Maybe I should console her...""

Charlotte‚Äôs gaze turned arctic.

She recognized those voices‚ÄîLucas‚Äôs so-called friends, the ones who‚Äôd sweetly called her ""sister-in-law"" to her face.

The woman beside her fidgeted, avoiding eye contact. When Charlotte stood, she probably expected her to slink away in shame.

Instead, Charlotte cleared her throat, picked up her coffee, and strolled to the divider. Leaning against it, she chimed in lightly, ""Let‚Äôs be fair. Lucas was devoted to me once. Eight years is a long time‚Äîwas I really so easy to replace?""

The room plunged into silence.

Every face on the other side went rigid with shock.

Just then, two tall men stepped in from the hallway.

All eyes flicked between her and the newcomers‚Äîthen collectively winced.

Lucas stood right behind Charlotte, his expression icy.

She finally noticed the shift and glanced over her shoulder.

So, he was here.

Turning back, she locked onto the short-haired girl lounging in the corner. Earlier, she‚Äôd been smirking like she owned the place. Now, she glared at Charlotte with venom.

Ah. So this was their little haunt. And from the sound of it, they‚Äôd been coming here together for a while‚Äîbrazen as hell.

Lucas strode forward.

The room erupted into panicked backtracking.

""Sis, we were just kidding‚Äî""

""Sis, Lucas and Arya aren‚Äôt like that‚Äî""

""Sis, don‚Äôt take it seriously‚Äî""

Lucas seized Charlotte‚Äôs wrist, dragging her toward the door.

She whirled and flung her coffee in his face.

The air turned to ice.

Everyone stared, stunned by her audacity.

Then, with a honeyed smile, she purred, ""Don‚Äôt let me ruin your fun with your precious trophy. Enjoy.""

She tried to wrench free.

Lucas‚Äôs expression darkened. Without a word, he hauled her over his shoulder and marched out.

The room collectively held its breath.

In the hallway, Charlotte kicked against his grip as he carried her. The elevator doors slid open just as they arrived.

As Lucas turned inside, she glimpsed polished black Oxfords, tailored slacks, and pale, elegant hands resting at someone‚Äôs sides‚Äîeach finger sculpted like marble.

The silence was oppressive.

When the elevator stopped, Charlotte glanced up‚Äîonly to meet sharp, hooded eyes watching her with detached amusement.

Her face burned. She ducked her head, pressing a hand to her forehead.

Outside the club, Lucas dumped her into his car‚Äôs backseat and climbed in after her.

Dizzy from being manhandled, Charlotte pushed herself upright, fighting nausea.

Lucas snatched a wet wipe from the glove compartment, scrubbing his face.

Her gaze caught on something half-hidden behind the tissue box‚Äîa suspicious foil packet.

His voice cut through her disgust. ""What were you doing here? Following me?""

She reached for the door.

This car was disgusting.

""Charlotte!"" Lucas snapped, yanking her back. ""Where the hell do you think you‚Äôre going? Are you done?""

Her breath came fast. Clenching her fists, she gritted out, ""I‚Äôm going home.""

# Chapter 4 - A Marriage of Silent Tensions

The car ride was silent. Charlotte Porter sat as far from Lucas as possible, her face pale like she might be sick any moment.

When they reached home, she stepped out immediately.

In the kitchen, she gulped down a full glass of ice water before steadying herself.

By the time she entered the living room, Lucas Myers was already seated. Charlotte took the chair opposite him.

Tension hung thick between them until Lucas finally spoke. ""I was at the club for business. Do you realize how ridiculous you looked barging in like that? Like some crazed, jealous wife.""

""Anything else?"" Charlotte replied flatly.

""If you want this marriage to work, stop with the baseless accusations. I don‚Äôt have time to baby your insecurities.""

""Noted. Anything else?""

Lucas scowled. ""Charlotte, do you hear how unreasonable you‚Äôre being?""

She stood, a faint smile touching her lips.

Soon, you won‚Äôt have to deal with me at all.

Without another word, she headed upstairs.

That smile only fueled Lucas‚Äô irritation. He lingered downstairs before going up to their bedroom, only to find her already asleep.

After his shower, he slid into bed beside her.

In the dark, Charlotte lay with her back to him, keeping just enough distance to avoid any contact.

Lucas turned abruptly and yanked her against him, his grip tight with restrained anger. Tall and strong, once he held her like this, she couldn‚Äôt move.

She spent the entire night stiff in his arms.

The next morning, Charlotte only made breakfast for herself.

When Lucas came downstairs, he found her alone at the table, eating toast. He detoured on his way out, leaning down to murmur in her ear, his tone deliberately softened. ""This weekend, let‚Äôs take the yacht out. Just the two of us.""

Charlotte sipped her milk and gave a vague hum.

Unsurprisingly, the day before their trip, he canceled‚Äîclaiming a last-minute business trip to London.

Charlotte felt nothing.

Maybe he hadn‚Äôt noticed, but they hadn‚Äôt shared a meal in weeks, hadn‚Äôt spent real time together in even longer. He forbade her from mentioning divorce, yet treated her like a ghost. If she disappeared, he probably wouldn‚Äôt even blink.

That weekend, she packed her books into a suitcase for her new place.

While shelving them, her rarely seen mother-in-law called.

Charlotte answered politely. ""Hello, Mrs. Myers.""

Lucas‚Äô mother‚Äôs voice dripped with condescension. ""Come to the estate. We need to put our agreement in writing.""

""Is that necessary?""

""I said it is.""

""Fine. I‚Äôll be there this afternoon.""

""Come at noon.""

""Alright.""

With nothing else planned, Charlotte agreed.

On the other end, Mrs. Myers watched from the window as Lucas walked through the garden with Arya Guzman, a smug smile curling her lips.

She wanted Charlotte to see for herself who truly belonged by her son‚Äôs side.

Charlotte arrived at the Myers estate at 11:40 AM.

The butler paled at the sight of her. He knew another guest was expected‚Äînot the young mistress. With Lucas and Arya in the living room, he broke into a cold sweat.

Only a select few‚Äîlike Lucas‚Äô assistant Micah Murphy and the household staff‚Äîknew about their marriage.

""This way,"" the butler said stiffly, leading her as instructed.

Before they reached the living room, a bright voice chimed. ""I won again! Lucas, you let me win!""

Charlotte froze.

For a split second, her mind went blank‚Äîthen everything snapped into place.

Hah.

A cold laugh escaped her before she stepped inside.

Dressed casually in a loose white blouse and jeans, her hair tied back messily, she wore no makeup.

Yet even like this, her porcelain skin, striking eyes, and full lips stood out, the loose strands only adding to her effortless elegance.

Lucas looked up, shock flashing in his eyes. ""What are you‚Äî""

""Your mother summoned me,"" she said coolly, her gaze mocking. ""Funny. Weren‚Äôt you supposed to be in London? Learn to teleport?""

Guilt flickered across his face.

Arya rose and sauntered over, extending a hand with deliberate challenge. ""Hi, I‚Äôm Arya Guzman.""

Charlotte ignored her completely.

Just then, Mrs. Myers swept in.

She gave Charlotte a dismissive glance before warmly taking Arya‚Äôs hand. ""Arya, darling, are you enjoying yourself? Make yourself at home.""

Then, with pointed emphasis, she gestured to Charlotte. ""This is Ms. Porter, one of our managers. We had some business to discuss.""

The message was clear: Charlotte was no more than an employee‚ÄîArya was the real choice.

Arya smirked. ""Oh, just an employee?""

Charlotte didn‚Äôt spare them a glance. Her eyes stayed locked on Lucas, watching for his reaction.

But his expression remained cold. No defense, no acknowledgment.

He didn‚Äôt care about her humiliation.

""Mrs. Myers, if there‚Äôs business, we can discuss it now,"" Charlotte said evenly.

""Another time. Since you‚Äôre here, stay for lunch.""

""No, thank you. I have things to do."" Charlotte turned to leave.

Mrs. Myers snapped, ""When an elder asks you to stay, you show respect. Where are your manners?""

Charlotte turned back, her gaze icy. ""Fine. I‚Äôll stay. Don‚Äôt regret it.""

She walked to the dining table and sat alone.

Arya, unfazed, plopped beside Lucas, clinging to his arm. ""Lucas, let‚Äôs finish our game!""

Lucas pulled free, his eyes darting to Charlotte.

""Do you play, Ms. Porter?"" Arya asked sweetly.

Charlotte glanced at the marble chessboard‚Äîexcept the pieces were set up for checkers. And somehow, Lucas had lost to her at even that.

He hasn‚Äôt forgotten how to be sweet. He just doesn‚Äôt want to be sweet to me anymore.

# Chapter 5 - The Silent Game of Blood and Pieces

Lucas Myers' eyes burned with irritation, his gaze filled with silent warning.

Arya Guzman confidently reset the game pieces on the board. ""Ms. Porter, white or black?""

Charlotte Porter picked up the black pieces. ""Black suits me.""

Arya and Lucas's mother nearly laughed at what seemed like self-deprecation‚Äîwho would openly insult themselves like that? But then they realized she was mocking them instead.

Arya gritted her teeth and made the first move.

Dozens of pieces scattered across the board as the game progressed. Lucas's mother, biased toward Arya, barely noticed Charlotte‚Äôs seemingly haphazard placements. She shot Lucas a smug look‚Äîthis was how a proper young lady from a good family behaved.

Lucas remained impassive.

As the game continued, Arya grew more frustrated. Every time she thought she had the advantage, Charlotte countered her. Still, if she couldn‚Äôt win, neither could Charlotte‚Äîat worst, it would end in a stalemate.

Humph. A draw with her? How pathetic.

""Your turn,"" Charlotte said.

Arya had three pieces in a hidden corner‚Äîone more, and she‚Äôd win. She placed her piece with feigned calm, then tensed as Charlotte moved elsewhere. Triumphant, she exclaimed, ""I win!""

Lucas's mother immediately clapped.

But then Charlotte‚Äôs slender fingers began removing pieces from the board.

Too late, they realized‚ÄîCharlotte had already connected five in a row.

Both women paled.

Charlotte took the remaining two pieces.

In Connect Five, the first to complete a line wins. But Arya, unwilling to admit defeat, snapped, ""Fine, you won first, but I have five now too!"" She defiantly added a fifth piece to her incomplete row.

Charlotte stared at her like she was an idiot. ""Then I suppose I can keep going."" She placed another piece, forming another five in a row.

For the next minute, she systematically dismantled Arya‚Äôs strategy, leaving her no chance to recover.

Arya‚Äôs face burned with humiliation as she demanded rematch after rematch.

Game two. Game three. Game four.

Charlotte toyed with her‚Äîsometimes prolonging the inevitable, sometimes ending it swiftly. Arya was nothing but a plaything.

Finally, Arya burst into tears.

""Enough!""

Lucas snatched the game box from Charlotte, his expression icy.

Seeing him take her side, Arya threw herself into his arms, sobbing as if Charlotte had ruthlessly bullied her. Lucas comforted her while his mother berated Charlotte, ""It‚Äôs just a game! Must you be so petty? No wonder you‚Äôre like this‚Äîsmall-minded, jealous, and uncultured!""

The words blurred into noise in Charlotte‚Äôs ears.

Lucas‚Äôs face, once radiant in her memories, now twisted into something unrecognizable‚Äîgray and lifeless.

Whatever.

Twenty more days.

She didn‚Äôt care anymore.

With a flick of her wrist, she scattered the remaining pieces across the board and stood, exhaustion weighing her down.

Drops of blood trailed from her palm‚Äîshe hadn‚Äôt realized she‚Äôd dug her nails in deep enough to break skin.

""Charlotte!""

Lucas called after her, his voice laced with rare urgency.

But Arya clung to him, wailing louder.

Charlotte left the Myers estate.

Her phone buzzed incessantly‚ÄîLucas calling. She blocked him without hesitation.

Then she texted Lucas's mother: Fifteen billion. One cent less, and you‚Äôll regret it.

The message nearly gave the woman a heart attack.

Rain began to fall as Charlotte drove, the downpour mirroring her scattered thoughts.

A flash of yellow‚Äîa speeding motorcycle cut in front of her. She slammed the brakes‚Äî

BANG!

The impact from behind threw her forward, her forehead hitting the steering wheel.

Pain flared.

Through the rain-streaked windshield, the world blurred crimson.

She wiped blood from her eyes with a tissue.

The motorcycle was long gone.

A knock at her window.

She rolled it down.

A refined, bespectacled man in his fifties stood there, holding a black umbrella. ""Miss, we take full responsibility for the collision. Our young master is in a hurry‚Äîcould we exchange details and settle this later? We‚Äôll cover all costs.""

""Let the police handle it.""

Already on edge, Charlotte wasn‚Äôt in the mood for negotiation.

She stepped out, inspecting the dented rear of her car. After photographing the damage, she called the authorities.

The man sighed, returning to the Bentley. ""She insists on involving the police, sir. What should we‚Äî?""

The rain poured harder.

22M, 171 cm, 60 kg, non-smoker, no medications, no previous medical issues.

Description:
About six months ago, while doing pull-ups on a full stomach, I felt a strange popping sensation in the upper stomach area. Shortly after, I developed acid reflux for the first time in my life. I experienced severe burning after eating, especially with acidic or spicy foods and coffee. I took medication prescribed for one week and adjusted my diet, which helped the symptoms improve gradually.

After about a month, I returned to normal and could eat most foods without discomfort. However, every time I resume training, especially pull-ups or chest exercises, the acid reflux returns with burning and chest heat.

Questions:
	1.	Should I see a gastroenterologist or an internal medicine doctor?
	2.	Has anyone experienced reflux specifically triggered by upper-body workouts like pull-ups?
	3.	What treatments or lifestyle changes helped you manage this and return to regular training?

I‚Äôm committed to exercise and need advice on how to manage or cure this so I can keep training without symptoms.

Thanks in advance.

1locwqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1locwqp/shutdown_by_laurell_k_hamilton/,Shutdown by Laurell K. Hamilton:,"¬†Have you ever had to have lunch with your lover‚Äôs fianc√©? It was a first for me, too. There were four of us at lunch, but only one of us was new to half the table. Dr. Ellen Radborne was about my height, 5' 3"" with thick shoulder length brunette hair that I might have thought was black, but my hair was black, so I knew hers was really just dark brown. Her eyes were brown, like mine, though again mine were a little darker. She had a pale summer tan, to my nearly white skin, but then my skin never tanned, it just burned, and then went back to being pale. She was curvy, maybe not as curvy through the chest as me, but no man who liked breasts would complain that she lacked. She was in shape, though not as fit as I, but then I doubt she needed to hit the weights and cardio as hard for her job as I did for mine.  
  
¬† We‚Äôd chatted through ordering food, eating food, and finally ordered coffee and tea, and still they hadn‚Äôt brought up anything serious, or anything to do with the reason for this meeting. I hadn't had to endure this much small talk in years. We‚Äôd learned a lot about each other, but unless we were looking to date, I didn‚Äôt see the point.  
  
¬† She taught college level biology, and continued to do research field work in the summers. She reminded me of the last two serious girlfriends he‚Äôs had. He certainly had a type, as if only the names changed for his short, dark haired women. He‚Äôd sleep with a variety, but for serious dating it was always women like us. She liked camping, bird watching, hiking, caving, climbing, and all sorts of outdoor stuff. I had, at one time, enjoyed all of that, but my job as a U. S. Marshal for the preternatural branch didn‚Äôt leave me much room for hobbies.  
  
¬† My gym time was more serious, because my life could depend on how fast I could run, how hard I could hit, and just how tough I could be. Dr. Radborne probably didn‚Äôt have to worry about any of that. It meant I could have out arm wrestled her, but she probably had a more reasonable work schedule.  
  
¬† We sat across from each other smiling, but her eyes were a little uncertain, and I was trying very hard not to make my eyes look empty. Most women took eyes that were too neutral as unfriendly. Men understood that sometimes you didn‚Äôt want to smile, but you weren‚Äôt mad either, while women expect other women to be pleasant, and if you‚Äôre not they think you don‚Äôt like them. There are so many reasons that most of my friends are men.  
  
¬† The only saving grace to this Saturday lunch fiasco was that we weren‚Äôt alone, though in some ways that also made it more awkward. I was still happy to have a hand to hold on my side of the table while she hung on the arm of her fianc√© across the table from us.  
  
¬† The us was Micah Callahan, who was the same height as the good doctor and me. He was the only man I‚Äôd ever dated who matched my height. Micah was wearing a forest green t-shirt that was actually made of silk, which always seemed wrong for a t-shirt, but since it also made it petably soft and looked fabulous on him I didn‚Äôt complain. It made the rim of green around his irises more vibrant, and the circle of yellow on the outside of them more gold, so that his eyes were even more beautiful set in the delicate triangle of his dark skinned face. He still had his summer tan that he got every year from jogging in nothing but shorts, so he was dark and his eyes were jewel-like in the almost feminine beauty of his face. The shirt also fit every curve of his upper body, showing just how much muscle was under there. He had broad shoulders for his size, and a nice chest that went down to a waist so slender we could share some of our jeans, but in too many clothes he just looked delicate, because he fought for every ounce of muscle he got in the gym, or on the track, which was not true for the man sitting beside Dr. Ellen Radborne.  
  
¬† Richard Zeeman was 6' 1"" and had always muscled easily, and it showed in his broad shoulders, impressive chest, and the swell of his arms against his own cotton t-shirt, which was also forest green. It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me to coordinate what the boys were wearing. Dr. Ellen had asked Richard to ask what I was wearing, so that I‚Äôd had to think about it ahead of time more than I normally would for a Saturday. I‚Äôd told her jeans and a t-shirt with boots, because it was fall. I was wearing skinny black jeans tucked into some really nice boots, and a silk t-shirt that matched Micah‚Äôs except for color -- mine was red, which matched my lipstick, and brought out the flame pattern in my boots. The boots were fun, and I figured I‚Äôd need some fun for the lunch. I‚Äôd been right, but Ellen had worn more ordinary blue jeans tucked into dressy brown cowboy boots, and a button up dress shirt in a blue that complimented the jeans more than her skin tone, or at least, that was my opinion, which I kept to myself. But it was unfortunate that the men were wearing nearly identical t-shirts, and that they both had their summer tans and looked fabulous in them. Micah looked better in his, but it was the eyes. Richard‚Äôs eyes were a deep, even, milk chocolate brown, lovely eyes, but they couldn‚Äôt compete with Micah‚Äôs leopard eyes. They were both wearing jeans, Micah in black, Richard in blue, so again we each coordinated with our other half. Micah was wearing black cordovan leather designer shoes so that with my three inch heels I was actually taller than he was, but he never cared, he was secure in all sorts of ways. Richard was wearing brown hiking boots, which was one of his favorite types of shoes on the weekends.  
  
¬† Richard‚Äôs hair fell in foaming waves of brown with golden highlights, and in strong enough sunlight I knew that there were threads of coppery red in it, so that saying he had brown hair never did it justice. Micah‚Äôs hair was curly, not wavy, and he normally wore it back in a pony tail, or a braid of some kind, but since this lunch was supposed to help Dr. Ellen understand that I had other yummy men in my life so I didn‚Äôt need to steal Richard from her, Micah had left the hair unbound around his shoulders so that it trailed deep brown chestnut curls to mid-back. My hair was the same length, and I realized, weirdly, that both Richard‚Äôs and Dr. Ellen‚Äôs hair was just past their shoulders. They say that after awhile couples begin to look alike.  
  
¬† She gave Richard‚Äôs arm a little extra squeeze where her arm was snaked through his, and then sat up more evenly in her own chair. ‚ÄúWell, this is more awkward than I thought it would be,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about as awkward as I thought it would be,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† Micah squeezed my hand under the table, a silent bid for me to play nice. I smiled harder, and did my best to push it up into my eyes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I did force this on all of us,‚Äù she said, and she looked genuinely uncomfortable.  
  
¬† I sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Ellen, I just meant that Miss Manners doesn‚Äôt cover this, and I don‚Äôt know what to say either. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She smiled a little uncertainly at me, but nodded, and took Richard‚Äôs hand across the white table cloth. ‚ÄúDo you understand why I wanted to meet?‚Äù  
  
¬† I shrugged, because I couldn‚Äôt think of anything good to say. Richard‚Äôs agenda for the lunch meeting had been to reassure his recent fianc√© that I had other men in my life, so I wouldn‚Äôt be trying to steal him back and keep him all to myself. Why did I feel we owed Richard this lunch? He wasn‚Äôt an ex-lover, but a current lover, and Ellen knew that, so socially awkward didn‚Äôt even begin to cover today‚Äôs little event.  
  
¬† I tried to take a sip of the coffee in front of me, but the smell alone made me put it back down. Weird, but it just smelled bitter. Micah hadn‚Äôt touched his either; maybe it wasn‚Äôt just me. Richard and Ellen had both ordered different kinds of hot tea, though they weren‚Äôt drinking either. I think we‚Äôd all ordered simply to have an excuse to stay at the table longer without the waiter bitching.  
  
¬† Micah said, ‚ÄúYou wanted some reassurance. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said, smiling at him and looking relieved, then her glance went back to me, ‚Äúthough I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm going to end up reassured. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I knew with that small eye flick that I looked too good, had dressed too well, and she had done that girl thing where you compare yourself to the ex,  
and she didn‚Äôt feel like she was winning. This was so not my problem; I hadn‚Äôt asked for the lunch, I‚Äôd told her what I was wearing. It wasn‚Äôt like I‚Äôd shown up in a designer outfit after telling her I was wearing jeans. It wasn‚Äôt my fault that I dressed my jeans up more than she did.  
  
¬† I looked at Richard across the table, and hoped he could read my expression, because I was fighting not to get angry. Micah started rubbing his thumb over the back of my hand where he held it on my thigh. He leaned in and laid a gentle kiss on my cheek. It made me let out the breath I‚Äôd been holding and try to ease the tension in my shoulders.  
  
¬† Richard hugged Ellen to him. ‚ÄúEllen, honey, you can see that Anita and Micah are a couple. What more do you want to be reassured?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHonestly?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat would be nice,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† Micah whispered, ‚ÄúEasy. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Ellen gave me a not entirely friendly look and said, ‚ÄúFor you not to sit there looking fabulously beautiful and making me feel like an ugly duckling to your swan. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say to that,‚Äù I said, and looked first at Micah and then at Richard for a clue, a hint, something.  
  
¬† Richard turned that handsome face to her, and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre beautiful, Ellen, you know that. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She shook her head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty, but I‚Äôm not . . . ‚Äù she waved vaguely in my direction, ‚Äú. . . this. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I sighed and looked at Micah for some help. He spoke out loud what I was thinking, ‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt believe you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat won‚Äôt I believe?‚Äù Ellen asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù he said, and moved his hand to my thigh, which was sometimes more calming for both of us than hand holding. He kept his other arm across my shoulders.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not prettier than you are,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† She gave me a look of utter scorn. ‚ÄúFrom one woman to another, don‚Äôt bullshit me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEllen, she‚Äôs not lying,‚Äù Richard said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow can you say that?‚Äù she demanded, and moved away from his hand.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow honest do you want me to be?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Micah said.

‚ÄúNot brutal,‚Äù Richard said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHonest,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWith the right makeup and a blue that had more jewel tones you‚Äôd look every bit as good as I do. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, thanks, are you going to offer to take me shopping next to give me makeup lessons?‚Äù Her voice was thick with scorn.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGod no, but the friends who gave me lessons taught me not to be afraid of color and bright red lipstick, because it looked good on me and on them. You dress like I did a couple of years ago, more subdued, but your coloring is close enough to mine that you need more color, that‚Äôs all. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA different shirt and lipstick isn‚Äôt going to make me exotic like you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I blinked at her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exotic. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFalse modesty is just irritating to the rest of us, Anita. You say you‚Äôre not exotic and not beautiful, and if you believe that than I have to be ugly in comparison. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnita has trouble seeing herself as beautiful,‚Äù Micah said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt owe her that story,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† Ellen looked at Micah, and then at me. I glared at her. I was about to be done being friendly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow do we make the point without it?‚Äù Micah asked, and that was him all over, he had his eye on the goal, which was to make her feel reassured. He was more goal-oriented even than I was, but for him and for the fact that our little social group was actually working better than it ever had, I‚Äôd try. God help me, but I‚Äôd try.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen I first started dating Richard I thought he was too handsome to like me. He was the kind of guy that made me feel awkward in high school, and that I just assumed would never look at me twice. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She looked at Richard and smiled, it was a good smile. ‚ÄúHe is amazing. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, he is, and it made me uncomfortable at first that he paid so much attention to me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs too handsome,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can never be too handsome,‚Äù she said smiling up at him. He smiled back. We were making progress.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRichard was the beginning of me understanding that I was attractive, because if beautiful men kept wanting to date me logic dictated that I had to be attractive enough to make them want to date me. ‚Äù I sighed, even to me that sounded convoluted like I was torturing the logic rather than making a point.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEvery woman knows how attractive she is, it‚Äôs ingrained into us as little girls. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot if one of the people raising you tells you that you‚Äôre not pretty as a little girl, and not if your father remarries someone that spends your childhood telling people, ‚ÄòNo, she‚Äôs not mine, from his first marriage. Her mother was Mexican. ‚Äô‚Äù I did my best imitation of my stepmother, Judith.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour stepmother said that?‚Äù Ellen asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúConstantly. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt your father stop her?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe never said it in front of him. It was actually my stepsister, Andria, who told my father when we were twelve. She and I didn‚Äôt get along that much, but apparently she was embarrassed that her mother was so . . . whatever, but it left me feeling too short, too dark, too not tall, blond and Nordic like everyone else in the family. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you see your mother part of the time?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe died when I was eight, and when I was younger I looked like she‚Äôd cloned herself except for father‚Äôs skin tone. Can‚Äôt tan worth a damn. Maybe that‚Äôs why my stepmother was so hateful, because I was a constant reminder of my father‚Äôs first love. Hell, I don‚Äôt know. One of the things you learn in therapy is that you can work on your own issues, and on healing the damage that was done to you, but you can‚Äôt fathom why the people that hurt you did what they did. That‚Äôs on their head, in their heart. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Ellen looked at me. ‚ÄúWhat an awful thing to do to a child. I‚Äôm so sorry. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell you for sympathy, I told you to try and explain that I have trouble seeing myself. Micah is beautiful and he loves me, Richard did love me and he‚Äôs gorgeous, and I have other men in my life who are just as amazing, so, like I said, logic dictates that if beautiful people keep wanting to date me, then I can‚Äôt be ugly. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut you still don‚Äôt feel beautiful,‚Äù she said softly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† She nodded. ‚ÄúSo you mean it, that you think we‚Äôre both pretty, because you don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre beautiful?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomething like that. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She took in some air, let it out slow, and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I got upset and made you feel like you had to share that story. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I shrugged, because, me too.  
  
¬† Richard said, ‚ÄúThank you. ‚Äù He looked way too sympathetic. I didn‚Äôt want sympathy from him right now.  
  
¬† Micah kissed me, gently so he wouldn‚Äôt be wearing too much of my red lipstick. It made me smile to see the line of red on his lips.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe go-faster-stripe,‚Äù he said, softly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe what?‚Äù Ellen asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe go-faster-stripe,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs what Nathaniel named the line of lipstick when I kiss them. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNathaniel is your other . . . ‚Äù she seemed lost for words.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBoyfriend works,‚Äù I said. I didn‚Äôt add that it was the phrase I used for vanilla friends who didn‚Äôt understand our alternative lifestyle and didn‚Äôt really want to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, Micah is your . . . ?‚Äù again she paused for help with the right word.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Ellen,‚Äù Micah said, ‚Äúvocabulary for polyamory is hard, even for us. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know that polyamory means loving more people, but beyond that I don‚Äôt really understand it,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm at a social event where we don‚Äôt know most of the people, then I introduce Micah and Nathaniel as my boyfriends, anything else just seems to confuse people. If we‚Äôre someplace where they understand what poly is, or at least it‚Äôs not straight vanilla, then Micah is my significant other, and Nathaniel is our Third. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat does third mean?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt usually means your live-in third partner,‚Äù Micah said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow do you introduce Nathaniel and Anita?‚Äù She asked Micah.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy girlfriend and our boyfriend, or Significant other and our Third, depending on the event. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen how would you introduce Richard?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† Micah and I looked at each other. He gave me a long look, letting me know this was my ball to hit. Great. ‚ÄúMicah has no relationship with Richard, really. Richard is never going to take me to a vanilla social event as his girlfriend, so that‚Äôs not an issue. At a more poly- or kink-friendly event, if we felt compelled to say anything, I guess, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs my Top. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Ellen turned to Richard. ‚ÄúHow would you introduce Anita?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAs my bottom, or submissive. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I shook my head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your submissive, I‚Äôll agree to the term bottom, but I‚Äôm not submissive to anyone. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Richard fought not to frown and almost succeeded. ‚ÄúI could argue that you are to other people, but fine. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Ellen was watching us closely. ‚ÄúOkay, why did you say one thing and Anita the other? What‚Äôs the difference between bottom and submissive?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTo me,‚Äù I said, trying not to frown at Richard, ‚Äúbottom is someone who just submits, or wants to be dominated, in the bedroom, or dungeon, but outside of that they are dominant and in control. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a complete answer, Anita. Some people who are very dominant in every other part of their life are submissive in the dungeon and bedroom, and are still okay with the term, and say they have a dominant. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, because I may like to be physically dominated, but no one dominates me by will, or force of personality. To me a submissive is more than just physically dominated, it‚Äôs about giving up your will to someone else and letting them control you more completely,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think what you let Asher do with you is sub  
missive,‚Äù Richard said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI disagree and since I‚Äôm the one getting tied up, it‚Äôs my call. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how either of you can let a vampire touch you, but Asher is submissive to Richard, so how can he also be dominant, or top, to Anita? If the two of you can‚Äôt even agree then how am I ever going to understand this?‚Äù Ellen asked.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt know what to say to her remark about vampires, so I let it go.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt is confusing,‚Äù Micah said, with a smile and an attempt to ease her discomfort. He was ignoring the vampire remark, too. We‚Äôd take the maze one twist at a time, I guess.  
  
¬† I was uncomfortable, too, but if it was ‚Äúmake this work or give up Richard‚Äù as a part of our social group I‚Äôd muscle through it. Richard had worked his therapy hard to come to a place where he could admit what made him happy, all of what made him happy, and try to find a way to incorporate all of it into his life. He‚Äôd found the woman he wanted to have the white picket fence marriage with, but he wanted to keep the black metal spike gate, too. I wasn‚Äôt sure you could have a white picket fence with a Gothic gate, but hey, it wasn‚Äôt my life. I was only a small part of Richard‚Äôs life, as he was a small part of mine now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd I am totally lost that Richard says that Asher is his submissive, but he‚Äôs also Anita‚Äôs top, and Richard is her top, too. Richard says that Asher is his submissive, but Anita is only a bottom. How can you have more than one of each?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMay I?‚Äù Micah asked.  
  
¬† Richard and I both said, ‚ÄúYes. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Micah smiled at Ellen. ‚ÄúFirst, Asher and Anita are both switches, which means they switch between top and bottom, but it‚Äôs more complicated than that, I‚Äôm afraid. Asher gives up almost all control to Richard in the dungeon/bedroom. He wants to be dominated in every way. Anita just wants Richard to dominate her physically with his superior strength, so she thinks of it as just bottoming. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut Richard says that she lets Asher do a great deal more than just use his strength. Asher . . . well, he . . . ‚Äù she seemed acutely embarrassed.

Picture this: You're in the zone. Ideas are flowing, tasks are getting crushed, and the world outside just... fades away. It's that feeling of deep, uninterrupted concentration, the kind that makes you feel truly productive and alive. But let's be honest, those moments can feel few and far between in our noisy, notification-driven world, right? We've all been there, trying to tackle a big project only to find our minds wandering after a few minutes, pulled in a million different directions.

It's frustrating, I know. But what if I told you there are ways to hack your brain's natural ability to focus, pushing past those everyday distractions and unlocking deeper levels of concentration? We're not talking about just ""trying harder"" or drinking more coffee. We're diving into advanced biohacks - smart, science-backed strategies to optimize your brain for peak performance. Here's what I've learned in my own journey to a more focused mind.

## Crafting Your Concentration Oasis: Environmental Biohacks

Your environment plays a massive role in how well you can focus. It's not just about finding a quiet corner; it's about actively shaping your surroundings to support deep work.

### The Power of Light

You might think light is just about seeing, but it's a huge biohacker's tool for focus.
* **Morning Sun Exposure:** Getting natural sunlight first thing in the morning signals to your brain that it's daytime, boosting alertness and setting your circadian rhythm. I've found that a quick 10-15 minute walk outside, even on a cloudy day, makes a noticeable difference in my morning clarity.
* **Optimizing Workspace Lighting:** Avoid harsh overhead lights. Instead, aim for soft, diffused lighting. Some people swear by specific color temperatures, like cooler white light (around 5000-6500K) during intense work periods to mimic natural daylight. As evening approaches, shifting to warmer, dimmer light (around 2700K) helps signal winding down, which indirectly boosts next-day focus by improving sleep quality.

### Soundscapes for Serenity

Noise is the enemy of focus, but silence isn't always the answer.
* **Active Noise Cancellation:** This is a game-changer if you're in a busy environment. Good quality noise-canceling headphones can create a personal bubble of quiet, letting you dive deep without interruption.
* **Binaural Beats and Focus Music:** This is actually pretty cool. Binaural beats are auditory illusions created by playing two slightly different frequencies into each ear. Your brain perceives a third ""beat"" frequency, which can help guide your brainwaves into states associated with focus (like beta or gamma waves). There are tons of apps and playlists designed for this. I often use instrumental music or ambient soundscapes - anything without lyrics that can pull my attention away.

## Fueling Your Brain: Nutritional Nudges & Smart Supplementation

Your brain is a hungry organ, and what you feed it directly impacts its ability to concentrate. This goes beyond just eating healthy; it's about targeted nutrition.

### Brain-Boosting Bites

* **Healthy Fats:** Think omega-3s, found in fatty fish like salmon, walnuts, and flax seeds. These are crucial for brain cell membranes and cognitive function. I try to make sure I'm getting a good dose of these regularly.
* **Antioxidant-Rich Foods:** Berries, dark leafy greens, and dark chocolate (in moderation, of course!) help protect your brain from oxidative stress, keeping those neural pathways clear for focused thought.
* **Choline Sources:** Choline is a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter vital for memory and learning. Eggs, liver, and some cruciferous vegetables are great sources.

### Strategic Supplementation for Clarity

Now, I'm not suggesting you replace a good diet with pills. But certain supplements can support your brain's natural functions.
* **L-Theanine:** Often found in green tea, L-Theanine can promote a state of calm alertness without drowsiness. It's fantastic for taking the edge off caffeine jitters while maintaining focus. I've found it helps smooth out my concentration.
* **Creatine:** Yes, the same stuff athletes use! It's not just for muscles; creatine helps with energy production in the brain, and some studies suggest it can improve short-term memory and reasoning, especially during mentally demanding tasks.
* **Omega-3s (EPA/DHA):** If you don't get enough from your diet, a high-quality fish oil supplement can be incredibly beneficial for overall brain health and sustained focus.

## Beyond the Desk: Movement & Mind-Body Biohacks

Concentration isn't just about what happens in your head; your body plays a huge role too.

### Movement for Mental Flow

* **Micro-Breaks & Movement Snacks:** Sitting for hours is a focus killer. Every 45-60 minutes, get up and move. Do some squats, stretch, walk a lap around the room. Even a few minutes can increase blood flow to the brain, re-energize you, and reset your attention. We've all experienced that afternoon slump, and a quick burst of movement is often the best antidote.
* **Targeted Exercise:** Regular cardiovascular exercise is profoundly beneficial for brain health, promoting neurogenesis (the growth of new brain cells) and improving cognitive function. It's a foundational biohack for everything, including focus.

### Breathwork for Brain State Control

This is where it gets really interesting. Your breath is an incredibly powerful tool for shifting your brain state.
* **Box Breathing:** Inhale for a count of four, hold for four, exhale for four, hold for four. Repeat. This simple technique can quickly calm your nervous system, reduce anxiety, and bring you into a more focused, present state. It's my go-to when my mind feels scattered.
* **4-7-8 Breathing:** Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold your breath for 7 counts, and exhale completely through your mouth for 8 counts. This is often used for relaxation, but a calmer mind is a more focused mind, so it's a great tool before a big task.

## Your Focused Future Starts Now

Unlocking uninterrupted concentration isn't about finding a single magic bullet; it's about intelligently layering these advanced biohacks to create an environment and an internal state where deep work thrives. It's about being intentional with your light exposure, what you eat, the sounds you let in, and how you use your body and breath.

Start small. Maybe try optimizing your morning light exposure for a week, or experiment with binaural beats during your next work session. Pay attention to how your focus shifts. You might be surprised at how much more you can accomplish, and how much more satisfying it feels to truly be in the zone. Your brain is an incredible machine, and with a little biohacking finesse, you can truly supercharge its ability to concentrate.",1,1751302868.0,BiohackingLibrary,0,1.0,False

When I first started keto, it felt like I was giving up all the little joys that used to make life beautiful. Slow weekend breakfasts with sweet crepes and hot coffee were one of my favorite rituals, and losing that hurt more than anything. Some days it made me want to quit keto altogether. Because honestly ‚Äî what was the point if I couldn‚Äôt even have breakfast with a smile?

Then one morning, after a rough, emotional week, I found a simple recipe for keto crepes. Just eggs, cream cheese, a bit of almond flour, and vanilla all blended together until smooth. I poured the batter into a hot nonstick pan, swirled it thin, and watched it set. I was nervous they‚Äôd stick or tear or taste like cardboard. But they flipped beautifully and made the kitchen smell like the cozy breakfasts I thought I‚Äôd lost.

I spread a little whipped cream on top, added sliced strawberries, and when I took that first bite ‚Äî I almost cried. It tasted like normal food. Like joy. Like I was still part of life. Keto wasn‚Äôt taking everything from me; it was just teaching me new ways to find comfort and happiness.

# ü•û The Quick Recipe

Blend 2 eggs, 2 oz cream cheese, 1 tbsp almond flour, and a splash of vanilla until smooth. Heat a nonstick pan over medium, pour in a little batter, swirl to coat thinly, and cook about 30‚Äì45 seconds on each side. Repeat until done. That‚Äôs it.

1locvdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GREhelp/comments/1locvdk/avoid_gre_knowledge_gaps_with_this_simple_study/,Avoid GRE Knowledge Gaps with This Simple Study Habit,"As you prepare for the GRE, you already know that two major components of your study plan are learning new content and applying that content through practice questions. However, as your prep progresses and you cover more and more material, it becomes harder to keep all of that knowledge easily accessible. You might understand a topic well today, but without revisiting it, your grasp can fade over time.

To stay sharp across all the topics you‚Äôve covered, it‚Äôs essential to build weekly review sessions into your study plan. These review sessions don‚Äôt need to be overly complicated or time-consuming, but they do need to be consistent. Without them, it‚Äôs easy to lose touch with concepts you‚Äôve already studied, even if you felt confident about them at the time.

Flashcards are one of the simplest and most effective tools for regular review. They allow you to reinforce key facts, formulas, vocabulary, and techniques‚Äîespecially when used actively and consistently. The beauty of flashcards is their flexibility. You can review them during downtime throughout your day, whether you‚Äôre commuting, waiting for your coffee, or sitting in a quiet corner for a few minutes. A handful of quick sessions adds up.

That said, reviewing concepts in isolation is only part of the equation. To really test your recall and application, set aside time each week to complete mixed practice sets on topics you‚Äôve already studied. For instance, if it‚Äôs been a while since you worked on arithmetic or coordinate geometry, build a short quiz that mixes questions from those areas. Doing so helps prevent the kind of knowledge gaps that often go unnoticed until a full-length practice test reveals them.

The GRE doesn‚Äôt reward short-term memorization. It rewards long-term understanding and application. So make sure your prep includes a regular cycle of learning, applying, and reviewing. The topics you studied two weeks ago are just as important as the ones you studied yesterday.

Reach out to me with any questions about your GRE prep. Happy studying!

I would ask my PI but she's deep in grant reviews and will be unavalible until next monday.

My thesis is entirely about creating a relistic heart phantom for the lab to use after I graduate and most of my research is about how and why I selected the materials I did for the phantom. So, a massive section of my disussion of my results is jusifying my choices and explaining why I went with one material vs another (AB epoxy vs UV, ethanol as a solvent vs methenol, etc). The other parts of my discussion are about the different tests I ran on the phantom to show how the lab will use the phantom to further their research.

Here's the issue: I know that traditionally, the method/material section you are soposed to justify all the choices you made about selecting a material and method vs another, but in my case that is the whole point of the discussion. In pretty much all thesis/disertations I've consulted, the methods/materials are a vehicle to get to the results.

Currently, my methods/materials section only includes the specific information used to create the final phantom with some basic justification: ""filter paper was selected for a subtrate to enable the even distribution of the dye and prevent the coffee ring effect."" My discussion goes into detail about how I tried to use silicone oil, kimwipe tissue, and filter paper and photos of the dye on each substrate. 

Is this the correct way of organizing my research based on the project ceriteria? It seems correct, but it directly contradicts all I know about science writing. Thanks for all the advice!

1loco4u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loco4u,Westin Manila Staycation Review,"Stay date: June 2025 - Overnight, Sat to Sun
Price: Php 10,500, Room only

Overall Review: Out of all of the Marriott Bonvoy hotels in the city, as a local, this is my go-to for staycations. Good value for money, new hotel, great service, solid Elite benefits, solid amenities for business travelers

Elite Benefits - For Marriott Bonvoy Platinum and above status - 
- [ ] Club lounge access
- [ ] Free breakfast buffet in the main restaurant or the lounge, which means you can select the 1,000 points as Welcome gift on top of the free breakfast
- [ ] No issues with 4pm late checkout
- [ ] As a Platinum Elite, I‚Äôm rarely upgraded to suites, but as an Ambassador Elite, so far, I always get suite upgrades, after I request for it in the app chat.  

Hotel Info
- [ ] Opened in March 2023
- [ ] https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/mnlwp-the-westin-manila/overview/
- [ ] +63 2-82562020 
- [ ] westinmanila@westin.com

Room
- [ ] The bed is extremely comfortable, as to be expected with Westin beds
- [ ] There‚Äôs a free lavender sleep balm
- [ ] Generous free bottled water - just request
- [ ] The free suite upgrade‚Äôs layout feels cramped though the room is 68sqm/732sqft. There‚Äôs only 1 bathroom accessible from both the living room and the bathroom, but eitherway, the extra space is appreciated. Can‚Äôt complain with a free upgrade. 
- [ ] For some reason , the aircon in the bedroom in the suite is blowing directly to your face in bed, so at night, we just turn it off. But the temp is still comfortable (at least for me)
- [ ] Comfortable working desk
- [ ] Full shower doors ü§£
- [ ] Strong shower pressures
- [ ] Bathtub has bath salts, loofah, nook to read a book

Service
- [ ] Excellent service - and as usual for Manila/SE Asian hotel, there‚Äôs no annoying pressure/expectation for tipping across all services in the entire hotel on top of the bill - dining, lugagge assistance. The custom for the entire PH is there is a 10% service charge tacked on the bill, and that‚Äôs that. 
- [ ] I‚Äôm usually able to check in early, but in case the room is not ready yet, I hang out in the Club Lounge while waiting
- [ ] Evening turndown service available, just request in the chat
- [ ] Free shoe shine service

Dining
- [ ] Lobby Lounge - Some nights there‚Äôs a live singer
- [ ] A spanish restaurant in the roofdeck - Cantabria
- [ ] 24/7 in room dining
- [ ] Seasonal Tastes - Buffet restaurant for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner
- [ ] Breakfast buffet is elaborate as you would expect in Manila and SE Asian hotels. Good mix of different cusines, and a special section on wellness focused items

Parking
- [ ] Free parking for hotel guests
- [ ] Valet service available

Gym, Pool, and Spa
- [ ] 24/7 Gym
- [ ] The pool is outdoors - 6am - 10pm. They have an outdoor Jacuzzi as well which is interesting
- [ ] Pool and Gym on the small side but it‚Äôs ok - It‚Äôs rarely crowded
- [ ] Convenient self-service Water station by the pool
- [ ] Pool towels available 
- [ ] Free steam room access foe guests in the Spa

Location
- [ ] 5 mins walk away from Edsa Shangri-la Hotel
- [ ] 5 mins walk away upscale malls - Shangri-la Plaza, The Podium
- [ ] For business travelers, the best hotel location is the one that is walking distance to your office or wherever you need to be. Traffic in Manila is horrible and unpredictable - if you need to take a car to wherever you‚Äôre going, you‚Äôre going to be late or have to leave unnecessarily early

Club Lounge
- [ ] You can check in and checkout from the lounge
- [ ] All day snacks, coffee, juices, soft drinks
- [ ] Plenty of plugs for working
- [ ] Food at the cocktail hour is more than enough for dinner - No need to go out
- [ ] Club lounge is on the smaller side - It can get crowded during cocktail hours

But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria‚Äîand my motivation‚Äîwere on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn‚Äôt promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I‚Äôd tried before‚Äîand that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight‚Äîno skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit‚Ä¶ or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://b9859e7gjdml6p6kke272f2w9t.hop.clickbank.net/?&campaign=MitolynBOOM)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",0,1751302269.0,pppdizziness,0,0.33,False

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751302260.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False

But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria‚Äîand my motivation‚Äîwere on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn‚Äôt promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I‚Äôd tried before‚Äîand that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight‚Äîno skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit‚Ä¶ or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews?

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn‚Äôt promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I‚Äôd tried before‚Äîand that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight‚Äîno skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit‚Ä¶ or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://b9859e7gjdml6p6kke272f2w9t.hop.clickbank.net/?&campaign=MitolynBOOM)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction.

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751302227.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False

But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria‚Äîand my motivation‚Äîwere on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn‚Äôt promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I‚Äôd tried before‚Äîand that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight‚Äîno skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit‚Ä¶ or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

First date should be coffee or drinks. Do not spend money on these women early. If there's no connection, all you paid for was some coffee and on to next.

I'd set these dates up after work and try not to stay for more than 30 mins. Most of the time these women work as well so the timing works.

Mr. Hough met his wife (Carolyn Ann Marks Hough) in 1943 when they both started the first grade at Lilesville School. They were later high school sweethearts and then went on to be happily married for 62 years.,"Mr. James Moody Hough, age 84, of Wadesboro died Wednesday, December 30, 2020. Born on a farm between Ansonville and Lilesville, Mr. Hough joined the U.S. Coast Guard at age 19 as a ""fireman apprentice"" and worked his way up through the ranks to retire 21 years later as a Lieutenant Commander after a very distinguished and decorated military career.

An excellent swimmer, a tri-state debate champion, a master parliamentarian, and an expert on the U.S. Constitution, Mr. Hough¬†was also a 32nd Degree Mason for 63 years, holding lifetime memberships in lodges in North Carolina, Alabama, and Oklahoma.

He was also a member of the Order of the Eastern Star and volunteered for over 20 years as a Guardian ad Litem, a court-appointed and unaffiliated advocate and spokesperson for children embroiled in the court system.

After his military retirement, Mr. Hough moved his family back to his native Anson County where he worked as a hydroelectric power plant operator at Blewett Falls for 15 years. He also retired from Carolina Power & Light. Mr. Hough attended Mars Hill College and Temple University.

He could send and receive Morse Code expertly, and he etched in his memory every single shoal, sandbar, navigational buoy, and shoreline feature along the entire eastern U.S. coastline. He was stationed in the Territory of Hawaii when it became ratified as our country's 50th state. He protected the southern coast during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

He memorized all constellations and could easily steer any ship solely by looking at the stars. Stationed on two lighthouses and six different Coast Guard cutters, he crossed the International Dateline twice and circled the North Pole on an icebreaker.

An opinionated, vocal, fierce, spirited man, Mr. Hough also had a dry sense of humor and an extremely quick wit. His personality was often too much for others to handle, but he was, at ALL times, ""comfortable in his own skin.""

He drank his coffee strong and black with two scoops of ice. He put ketchup in his oyster stew. He truly loved his mother-in-law.

Professing his religious belief and making the decision to be baptized before he was seven years old, Mr. Hough was a faithful member of the Baptist Church and served as a deacon in every church he ever joined as an adult. With each new duty station, he found a good church in the area and served his brothers and sisters in Christ to the best of his ability. In church, he could preach, he could pray, he could teach Sunday School, and he could lead; however, he could NOT sing! Mr. Hough carried only one picture in his wallet (and the same picture all those years) -- a picture of Jesus.

Mr. Hough met his wife (Carolyn Ann Marks Hough) in 1943 when they both started the first grade at Lilesville School. They were later high school sweethearts and then went on to be happily married for 62 years.

At the time of his passing, he was survived by his wife, Ann Marks Hough & their three children, two grandchildren, one great grandchild & his sister.

Steve Bailey's notes; in our many conversations over the years, Mr. Hough enjoyed telling me that he was born November 12, 1936. His father, William Randolph Hough was born October 23, 1861 & was 75 years old when he was born in 1936. His Half-siblings of his dads first marriage were all in their 40's & 50's when he was born.

-if you‚Äôre breastfeeding, congrats! You have a new teething superpower! Nothing solves a meltdown like a boob in the screaming baby. However, you are now entering Human Pacifier stage, and your noodle nips will suffer the consequences. Break out the silverettes, balm, cold packs, whatever it takes. The contents of your bra are now a war zone, good luck, soldier.
-Milk bleb? The only advice is don‚Äôt poke it at with tweezers in a sleep deprived stupor like SOMEONE I know. Otherwise beware the burning torture of the first few minutes of a latch! 
-Men/Dads: I‚Äôm sorry but your only use here is to revert back to your initial newborn training as your bodies have not evolved to be a Human Pacifier yet. Change diapers, and there will be ample gooey ones, and hold the screaming baby so Mom can disassociate appropriately in a scalding hot shower. 
-You‚Äôre now in a Treat Yo Self era. Dinner budgets be damned, the only thing that can win over this stage of parenting is bougie ramen and ice cream sundaes. Trust me, those frozen meal prep dishes you have won‚Äôt heal the wounds of the day like an unholy amount of DoorDash.
-To moms that aren‚Äôt breastfeeding‚Äîyou deserve the world for having to go through this stage without the quick fix of a boob, and I hope you are treated like an absolute goddess at every step. I hope these stages pass quickly for you.

And advice for a newbie,"Hi, I'm new and recently-ish prediabetic! I have been doing a lot of reading on here (thank you for all of your success stories!) but still have a few questions, grateful for any and all help and sorry of some of this is repetitive.

*My background:*

My doctor tells me for my age (32F) and otherwise decent health (a bit overweight but things like cholesterol are fine) that I don't really need to come in for a physical more often than every few years or so, despite elevated A1C levels. I'm frustrated that I just get this diagnosis via online test results without any follow up or advice from my doctor and am left to figure it out myself.

In Fall 2023 after I got blood work done and my A1C came back at 5.8, I started subbing some of my strength training sessions with indoor cycling/spin classes and cut down (but did not eliminate) my alcohol intake. I felt like that was a really good start but about a week ago I went in again and my blood work showed 6.0, which was a bummer, though I had also just had a cup of coffee on an empty stomach and a hot uphill walk to the doctors office. I excercise (strength training and high impact cardio) 4x a week and eat lots of fruits and veggies, but also have a sedentary job and love bread and sweets and a good wine. I want to manage this prediabetes before it becomes a greater issue and I can no longer have the things I love.

*My questions:*

* How often do you get your A1C checked? Do you always do it at the doctors office or is there another way? Is this regularly covered by private isurance if you are in the US as preventative care? Mine supposedly says it does but I'm skeptical if I were to go \~quarterly just to see.
* A complete diet and lifestyle overhaul sounds overwhelming and I have an eating disorder history -- is there a way to reduce your A1C and blood sugar levels ""intuitively"" without a lot of tracking? Most macro trackers seem to also track calories, which I don't want, but I'm open to suggestions if I'm wrong. I'm okay with tracking specific outcomes (like A1C or blood sugar), I just don't want to be a slave to My Fitness Pal ever again.
* Some sources say that losing even just a small amount of weight (5-10 lbs) can make a big difference, has anyone found this to be true? I don't weigh myself currently but I imagine I'm somewhere around 180-185 lbs, 5'4"" right now, I don't see myself realistically dropping 50 lbs but 5-10 seems doable without getting myself in a bad headspace.
* I've been thinking about a CGM but it just seems really expensive and the budget is tight right now. Is this ever covered by insurance? For folks who have used a CGM, how long did you use it before you felt like you had enough data to move forward without it? Or is it something you feel you will use forever?",4,1751301731.0,prediabetes,7,0.84,False

 Jude had the skull of a peasant who had been trepanned in the sixteenth century, to let the demons out. He kept a collection of pens jammed into the hole in the center of the cranium.  
  
¬† He had a three-hundred-year-old confession, signed by a witch. ‚ÄúI did spake with a black dogge who sayd hee wouldst poison cows, drive horses mad and sicken children for me if I wouldst let him have my soule, and I sayd aye, and after did give him sucke at my breast.‚Äù She was burned to death.  
  
¬† He had a stiff and worn noose that had been used to hang a man in England at the turn of the nineteenth century, Aleister Crowley‚Äôs childhood chessboard, and a snuff film. Of all the items in Jude‚Äôs collection, this last was the thing he felt most uncomfortable about possessing. It had come to him by way of a police officer, a man who had worked security at some shows in L.A. The cop had said the video was diseased. He said it with some enthusiasm. Jude had watched it and felt that he was right. It was diseased. It had also, in an indirect way, helped hasten the end of Jude‚Äôs marriage. Still he held on to it.  
  
¬† Many of the objects in his private collection of the grotesque and the bizarre were gifts sent to him by his fans. It was rare for him to actually buy something for the collection himself. But when Danny Wooten, his personal assistant, told him there was a ghost for sale on the Internet and asked did he want to buy it, Jude didn‚Äôt even need to think. It was like going out to eat, hearing the special, and deciding you wanted it without even looking at the menu. Some impulses required no consideration.  
  
¬† Danny‚Äôs office occupied a relatively new addition, extending from the northeastern end of Jude‚Äôs rambling, 110-year-old farmhouse. With its climate control, OfficeMax furniture, and coffee-and-cream industrial carpet, the office was coolly impersonal, nothing at all like the rest of  
the house. It might have been a dentist‚Äôs waiting room, if not for the concert posters in stainless-steel frames. One of them showed a jar crammed with staring eyeballs, bloody knots of nerves dangling from the backs of them. That was for the All Eyes On You tour.  
  
¬† No sooner had the addition been built than Jude had come to regret it. He had not wanted to drive forty minutes from Piecliff to a rented office in Poughkeepsie to see to his business, but that would‚Äôve probably been preferable to having Danny Wooten right here at the house. Here Danny and Danny‚Äôs work were too close. When Jude was in the kitchen, he could hear the phones ringing in there, both of the office lines going off at once sometimes, and the sound was maddening to him. He had not recorded an album in years, had hardly worked since Jerome and Dizzy had died (and the band with them), but still the phones rang and rang. He felt crowded by the steady parade of petitioners for his time, and by the never-ending accumulation of legal and professional demands, agreements and contracts, promotions and appearances, the work of Judas Coyne Incorporated, which was never done, always ongoing. When he was home, he wanted to be himself, not a trademark.  
  
¬† For the most part, Danny stayed out of the rest of the house. Whatever his flaws, he was protective of Jude‚Äôs private space. But Danny considered him fair game if Jude strayed into the office‚Äîsomething Jude did, without much pleasure, four or five times a day. Passing through the office was the fastest way to the barn and the dogs. He could‚Äôve avoided Danny by going out through the front door and walking all the way around the house, but he refused to sneak around his own home just to avoid Danny Wooten.  
  
¬† Besides, it didn‚Äôt seem possible Danny could always have something to bother him with. But he always did. And if he didn‚Äôt have anything that demanded immediate attention, he wanted to talk. Danny was from Southern California originally, and there was no end to his talk. He would boast to total strangers about the benefits of wheatgrass, which included making your bowel movements as fragrant as a freshly mowed lawn. He was thirty years old but could talk skateboarding and PlayStation with the pizza-delivery kid like he was fourteen. Danny would get confessional with air-conditioner repairmen, tell them how his sister had OD‚Äôd on heroin in her teens and how as a young man he had been the one to find his mother‚Äôs body after she killed herself. He was impossible to embarrass. He didn‚Äôt know the meaning of shy.  
  
¬† Jude was coming back inside from feeding Angus and Bon and was halfway across Danny‚Äôs field of fire‚Äîjust beginning to think he might make it through the office unscathed‚Äîwhen Danny said, ‚ÄúHey, Chief, check this out.‚Äù Danny opened almost every demand for attention with just this line, a statement Jude had learned to dread and resent, a prelude to half an hour of wasted time, forms to fill out, faxes to look at. Then Danny told him someone was selling a ghost, and Jude forgot all about begrudging him. He walked around the desk so he could look over Danny‚Äôs shoulder at his computer screen.  
  
¬† Danny had discovered the ghost at an online auction site, not eBay but one of the wannabes. Jude moved his gaze over the item description while Danny read aloud. Danny would‚Äôve cut his food for him if Jude gave him the chance. He had a streak of subservience that Jude found, frankly, revolting in a man.  
  
¬† ‚Äú ‚ÄòBuy my stepfather‚Äôs ghost,‚Äô‚Äù Danny read. ‚Äú ‚ÄòSix weeks ago my elderly stepfather died, very suddenly. He was staying with us at the time. He had no home of his own and traveled from relative to relative, visiting for a month or two before moving on. Everyone was shocked by his passing, especially my daughter, who was very close to him. No one would‚Äôve thought. He was active to the end of his life. Never sat in front of the TV. Drank a glass of orange juice every day. Had all his own teeth.‚Äô‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is a fuckin‚Äô joke,‚Äù Jude said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Danny said. He went on, ‚Äú ‚ÄòTwo days after his funeral, my little girl saw him sitting in the guest room, which is directly across from her own bedroom. After she saw him, my girl didn‚Äôt like to be alone in her room anymore, or even to go upstairs. I told her that her grandfather wouldn‚Äôt ever hurt her, but she said she was scared of his eyes. She said they were all black scribbles and they weren‚Äôt for seeing anymore. So she has been sleeping with me ever since.  
  
¬† ‚Äú ‚ÄòAt first I thought it was just a scary story she was telling herself, but there is more to it than that. The guest room is cold all the time. I poked around in there and noticed it was worst in the closet, where his Sunday suit was hung up. He wanted to be buried in that suit, but when we tried it on him at the funeral home, it didn‚Äôt look right. People shrink up a little after they die. The water in them dries up. His best suit was too big for him, so we let the funeral home talk us into buying one of theirs. I don‚Äôt know why I listened.  
  
¬† ‚Äú ‚ÄòThe other night I woke up and heard my stepfather walking around overhead. The bed in his room won‚Äôt stay made, and the door opens and slams shut at all hours. The cat won‚Äôt go upstairs either, and sometimes she sits at the bottom of the steps looking at things I can‚Äôt see. She stares awhile, then gives a yowl like her tail got stepped on and runs away.  
  
¬† ‚Äú ‚ÄòMy stepfather was a lifelong spiritualist, and I believe he is only here to teach my daughter that death is not the end. But she is eleven and needs a normal life and to sleep in her own room, not in mine. The only thing I can think is to try and find Pop another home, and the world is full of people who want to believe in the afterlife. Well, I have your proof right here.  
  
¬† ‚Äú ‚ÄòI will ‚Äúsell‚Äù my stepfather‚Äôs ghost to the highest bidder. Of course a soul cannot really be sold, but I believe he will come to your home and abide with you if you put out the welcome mat. As I said, when he died, he was with us temporarily and had no place to call his own, so I am sure he would go to where he was wanted. Do not think this is a stunt or a practical joke and that I will take your money and send you nothing. The winning bidder will have something solid to show for their investment. I will send you his Sunday suit. I believe if his spirit is attached to anything, it has to be that.  
  
¬† ‚Äú ‚ÄòIt is a very nice old-fashioned suit made by Great Western Tailoring. It has a fine silver pinstripe,‚Äô blah-blah, ‚Äòsatin lining,‚Äô blah-blah‚Ä¶.‚Äù Danny stopped reading and pointed at the screen. ‚ÄúCheck out the measurements, Chief. It‚Äôs just your size. High bid is eighty bucks. If you want to own a ghost, looks like he could be yours for a hundred.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs buy it,‚Äù Jude said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSeriously? Put in a bid for a hundred dollars?‚Äù  
  
¬† Jude narrowed his eyes, peering at something on the screen, just below the item description, a button that said YOURS NOW: $1,000. And beneath that: Click to Buy and End Auction Immediately! He put his finger on it, tapping the glass.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just make it a grand and seal the deal,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† Danny rotated in his chair. He grinned and raised his eyebrows. Danny had high, arched, Jack Nicholson eyebrows, which he used to great effect. Maybe he expected an explanation, but Jude wasn‚Äôt sure he could‚Äôve explained, even to himself, why it seemed reasonable to pay a thousand dollars for an old suit that probably wasn‚Äôt worth a fifth of that. Later he thought it might be good publicity: Judas Coyne buys a poltergeist. The fans ate up stories like that. But that was later. Right then, in the moment, he just knew he wanted to be the one who bought the ghost.  
  
¬† Jude started on, thinking he would head upstairs to see if Georgia was dressed yet. He had told her to put on her clothes half an hour ago but expected to find her still in bed. He had the sense she planned to stay there until she got the fight she was looking for. She‚Äôd be sitting in her underwear, carefully painting her toenails black. Or she‚Äôd have her laptop open, surfing Goth accessories, looking for the perfect stud to poke through her tongue, like she needed any more goddam‚Ä¶And then the thought of surfing the Web caused Jude to hold up, wondering something. He glanced back at Danny.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you come across that anyway?‚Äù he asked, nodding at the computer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe got an e-mail about it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFrom who?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFrom the auction site  
. They sent us an e-mail that said ‚ÄòWe notice you‚Äôve bought items like this before and thought you‚Äôd be interested.‚Äô‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve bought items like this before?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOccult items, I assume.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never bought anything off that site.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe you did and just don‚Äôt remember. Maybe I bought something for you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Jude said, ‚ÄúFuckin‚Äô acid. I had a good memory once. I was in the chess club in junior high.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou were? That‚Äôs a hell of a thought.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat? The idea that I was in the chess club?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI guess. It seems so‚Ä¶geeky.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. But I used severed fingers for pieces.‚Äù  
  
¬† Danny laughed‚Äîa little too hard, convulsing himself and wiping imaginary tears from the corners of his eyes. The sycophantic little suck-ass.  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† The suit came early Saturday morning. Jude was up and outside with the dogs.  
  
¬† Angus lunged as soon as the UPS truck ground to a halt, and the leash was yanked out of Jude‚Äôs hand. Angus leaped against the side of the parked truck, spit flying, paws scuffling furiously against the driver‚Äôs-side door. The driver remained behind the wheel, peering down at him with the calm but intent expression of a doctor considering a new strain of Ebola through a microscope. Jude caught the leash and pulled on it, harder than he meant to. Angus sprawled on his side in the dirt, then twisted and sprang back up, snarling. By now Bon was in on the act, straining at the end of her leash, which Jude held in his other hand, and yapping with a shrillness that hurt his head.

¬† Because it was too far to haul them all the way back to the barn and their pen, Jude dragged them across the yard and up to the front porch, both of them fighting him the whole time. He shoveled them in through the front door and slammed it behind them. Immediately they set to flinging themselves against it, barking hysterically. The door shuddered as they slammed into it. Fucking dogs.  
  
¬† Jude shuffled back down into the driveway, and reached the UPS truck just as the rear door slid open with a steely clatter. The deliveryman stood inside. He hopped down, holding a long, flat box under his arm.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOzzy Osbourne has Pomeranians,‚Äù the UPS guy said. ‚ÄúI saw them on TV. Cute little dogs like house cats. You ever think about getting a couple cute little dogs like that?‚Äù  
  
¬† Jude took the box without a word and went inside.  
  
¬† He brought the box through the house and into the kitchen. He put it on the counter and poured coffee. Jude was an early riser by instinct and conditioning. When he was on the road, or recording, he had become accustomed to rolling into bed at five in the morning and sleeping through most of the daylight hours, but staying up all night had never come naturally. On the road he would wake at four in the afternoon, bad-tempered and headachy, confused about where the time had gone. Everyone he knew would seem to him clever impostors, unfeeling aliens wearing rubber skin and the faces of friends. It took a liberal quantity of alcohol to make them seem like themselves again.  
  
¬† Only it had been three years since he‚Äôd last gone on tour. He didn‚Äôt have much interest in drinking when he was home, and was ready for bed most nights by nine. At the age of fifty-four, he had settled back into the rhythms that had guided him since his name was Justin Cowzynski and he was a boy on his father‚Äôs hog farm. The illiterate son of a bitch would have dragged him out of bed by the hair if he‚Äôd found him in it when the sun came up. It was a childhood of mud, barking dogs, barbed wire, dilapidated farm buildings, squealing pigs with their flaking skin and squashed-in faces, and little human contact, beyond a mother who sat most of the day at the kitchen table wearing the slack, staring aspect of someone who had been lobotomized, and his father, who ruled their acres of pig shit and ruin with his angry laughter and his fists.  
  
¬† So Jude had been up for several hours already but had not eaten breakfast yet, and he was frying bacon when Georgia wandered into the kitchen. She was dressed only in a pair of black panties, her arms folded across her small, white, pierced breasts, her black hair floating around her head in a soft, tangly nest. Her name wasn‚Äôt really Georgia. It wasn‚Äôt Morphine either, although she had stripped under that name for two years. Her name was Marybeth Kimball, a handle so simple, so plain, she‚Äôd laughed when she first told him, as if it embarrassed her.  
  
¬† Jude had worked his way through a collection of Goth girlfriends who stripped, or told fortunes, or stripped and told fortunes, pretty girls who wore ankhs and black fingernail polish, and whom he always called by their state of origin, a habit few of them cared for, because they didn‚Äôt like to be reminded of the person they were trying to erase with all their living-dead makeup. She was twenty-three.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGoddam stupid dogs,‚Äù she said, shoving one of them out of her way with her heel. They were whisking around Jude‚Äôs legs, excited by the perfume of the bacon. ‚ÄúWoke me the fuck up.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe it was time to get the fuck up. Ever think?‚Äù She never rose before ten if she could help it.  
  
¬† She bent into the fridge for the orange juice. He enjoyed the view, the way the straps of her underwear cut into the almost-too-white cheeks of her ass, but he looked away while she drank from the carton. She left it on the counter, too. It would spoil there if he didn‚Äôt put it away for her.  
  
¬† He was glad for the adoration of the Goths. He appreciated the sex even more, their limber, athletic, tattooed bodies and eagerness for kink. But he had been married once, to a woman who used a glass and put things away when she was done, who read the paper in the morning, and he missed their talk. It was grown-up talk. She hadn‚Äôt been a stripper. She didn‚Äôt believe in fortune-telling. It was grown-up companionship.  
  
¬† Georgia used a steak knife to slice open the UPS box, then left the knife on the counter, with tape stuck to it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† A second box was contained within the first. It was a tight fit, and Georgia had to tug for a while to slide the inner box out onto the counter. It was large, and shiny, and black, and it was shaped like a heart. Candies sometimes came in boxes like that, although this was much too big for candies, and candy boxes were pink or sometimes yellow. A lingerie box, then‚Äîexcept he hadn‚Äôt ordered anything of the kind for her. He frowned. He didn‚Äôt have any idea what might be in it and at the same time felt somehow he should know, that the heart-shaped box contained something he‚Äôd been expecting.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs this for me?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† She pried the lid loose and took out what was inside, lifting it for him to see. A suit. Someone had sent him a suit. It was black and old-fashioned, the details blurred by the plastic dry-cleaning bag pulled over it. Georgia held it up by the shoulders, in front of her body, almost as if it were a dress she was thinking of trying on but she wanted his opinion of it first. Her gaze was questioning, a pretty furrow between her eyebrows. For a moment he didn‚Äôt remember, didn‚Äôt know why it had come.  
  
¬† He opened his mouth to tell her he had no clue, but then instead heard himself say, ‚ÄúThe dead man‚Äôs suit.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe ghost,‚Äù he said, remembering as he spoke. ‚ÄúI bought a ghost. Some woman was convinced her stepfather was haunting her. So she put his restless spirit up for sale on the Internet, and I bought it for a grand. That‚Äôs his suit. She thinks it might be the source of the haunting.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, cool,‚Äù Georgia said. ‚ÄúSo are you going to wear it?‚Äù  
  
¬† His own reaction surprised him. His skin crawled, went rough and strange with gooseflesh. For one unconsidered moment, the idea struck him as obscene.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, and she flicked a surprised glance at him, hearing something cold and flat in his voice. Her smirk deepened a little, and he realized he had sounded‚Ä¶well, not frightened but momentarily weak. He added, ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt fit.‚Äù Although, in truth, it looked as if the poltergeist had been about his height and weight in life.  
  
¬† Georgia said, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll wear it. I‚Äôm a bit of a restless spirit myself. And I look hot in men‚Äôs clothing.‚Äù  
  
¬† Again: a sensation of revulsion, a crawling of the skin. She shouldn‚Äôt put it on. It unsettled him that she would even joke about it, although he couldn‚Äôt have said why. He wasn‚Äôt going to let her put it on. In that one instant, he could not imagine anything more repellent.  
  
¬† And that was saying something. There wasn‚Äôt much that Jude found too distasteful to contemplate. He was unused to feeling disgust. The profane didn‚Äôt trouble him; it had made him a good living for thirty years.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stick it upstairs until I figure out what to do with it,‚Äù he said, trying for a dismissive tone‚Äîand not quite making it.  
  
¬† She stared at him, interested at this wavering of his usual self-possession, and then she pulled off the plastic dry-cleaning bag. The coat‚Äôs silver buttons flashed in the light. The suit was somber, as dark as crow feathers, but those buttons, the size of quarters, gave it something of a rustic character. Add a string tie and it was the sort of thing Johnny Cash might‚Äôve worn onstage.  
  
¬† Angus began to bark, high, shrill, panicked barking. He shoved himself back on his haunches, tail lowered, rearing away from the suit. Georgia laughed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt is haunted,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† She held the suit in front of her and waved it back and forth, walking it through the air toward Angus, flapping it at him, a bullfighter with cape. She moaned as she closed in on him, the throaty, drawn-out cry of a wandering haunt, while her eyes gleamed with pleasure.  
  
¬† Angus scrambled back, hit a stool at the kitchen counter, and knocked it over with a ringing crash. Bon stared out from beneath the old, bloodstained chopping block, ears flattened ag  
ainst her skull. Georgia laughed again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCut it the fuck out,‚Äù Jude said.  
  
¬† She shot him a snotty, perversely happy look‚Äîthe look of a child burning ants with a magnifying glass‚Äîand then she made a face of pain and shouted. Swore and grabbed her right hand. She flung the suit aside onto the counter.  
  
¬† A bright drop of blood fattened at the tip of her thumb and fell, plink, onto the tiled floor.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFucking pin.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou see what you get.‚Äù  
  
¬† She glared, flipped him the bird, and stalked out. When she was gone, he got up and put the juice back into the fridge. Jude dropped the knife in the sink, got a hand towel to wipe the blood off the floor‚Äîand then his gaze caught on the suit, and he forgot whatever it was he‚Äôd been about to do.  
  
¬† He smoothed it out, folded the arms over the chest, felt carefully around. Jude couldn‚Äôt find any pins, couldn‚Äôt figure out what she‚Äôd stuck herself on. He laid it gently back into its box.  
  
¬† An acrid odor caught his attention. He glanced into the pan and cursed. The bacon was burnt.  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† He put the box on the shelf in the back of his closet and decided to stop thinking about it.  
  
¬† 4  
  
¬† He was passing back through the kitchen, a little before six, to get sausages for the grill, when he heard someone whispering in Danny‚Äôs office.  
  
¬† The sound jumped him and halted him in his tracks. Danny had gone home more than an hour ago, and the office was locked, should‚Äôve been empty. Jude tilted his head to listen, concentrating intently on the low, sibilant voice‚Ä¶and in another moment he identified what he was hearing, and his pulse began to slow.  
  
¬† There was no one in there. It was only someone talking on the radio. Jude could tell. The low tones weren‚Äôt low enough, the voice itself subtly flattened out. Sounds could suggest shapes, painted a picture of the pocket of air in which they‚Äôd been given form. A voice in a well had a deep, round echo, while a voice in a closet sounded condensed, all the fullness squeezed out of it. Music was also geometry. What Jude was hearing now was a voice clapped into a box. Danny had forgotten to turn off the radio.  
  
¬† He opened the door to the office, poked his head in. The lights were off, and with the sun on the other side of the building, the room drowned in blue shadow. The office stereo was the third-worst in the house, which was still better than most home stereos, a stack of Onkyo components in a glass cabinet by the water cooler. The readouts were lit a vivid, unnatural green, the color of objects viewed through a night-vision scope, except for a single, glowing, vertical slash of red, a ruby mark showing the frequency to which the radio was tuned. The mark was a narrow slit, the shape of a cat‚Äôs pupil, and seemed to stare into the office with an unblinking, alien fascination.  
  
¬† ‚Äú‚Ä¶How cold is it going to get tonight?‚Äù said the man on the radio in a husky, almost abrasive tone. A fat man, judging by the wheeze when he exhaled. ‚ÄúDo we have to worry about finding bums frozen to the ground?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour concern for the welfare of the homeless is touching,‚Äù said a second man, this one with a voice that was a little thin, reedy.  
  
¬† It was WFUM, where most of the bands were named after fatal diseases (Anthrax), or conditions of decay (Rancid), and where the DJs tended to be preoccupied with crotch lice, strippers, and the amusing humiliations that attended the poor, the crippled, and the elderly. They were known to play Jude‚Äôs music, more or less constantly, which was why Danny kept the stereo tuned to them, as an act of both loyalty and flattery. In truth, Jude suspected that Danny had no particular musical preferences, no strong likes or dislikes, and that the radio was just background sound, the auditory equivalent of wallpaper. If he had worked for Enya, Danny would‚Äôve happily hummed along to Celtic chanting while answering her e-mails and sending faxes.  
  
¬† Jude started across the room to turn off the stereo but had not gone far before his step hitched, a memory snagging at his thoughts. An hour ago he‚Äôd been outside with the dogs. He had stood at the end of the dirt turnaround, enjoying the sharpness of the air, the sting on his cheeks. Someone down the road was burning a waste pile of deadfall and autumn leaves, and the faint odor of the spiced smoke had pleased him as well.  
  
¬† Danny had come out of the office, shrugging on his jacket, headed home. They stood talking for a moment‚Äîor, to be more accurate, Danny stood jawing at him while Jude watched the dogs and tried to tune him out. You could always count on Danny Wooten to spoil a perfectly good silence.  
  
¬† Silence. The office behind Danny had been silent. Jude could remember the crows going crawk-crawk and Danny‚Äôs steady stream of exuberant chatter, but not the sound of the radio coming from the office behind him. If it had been on, Jude thought he would‚Äôve heard. His ears were still as sensitive as they‚Äôd ever been. They had, against long odds, survived all that he‚Äôd inflicted upon them over the last thirty years. By comparison, Jude‚Äôs drummer, Kenny Morlix, the only other surviving member of his original band, had severe tinnitus, couldn‚Äôt even hear his wife when she was yelling right in his face.  
  
¬† Jude started forward once more, but he was ill at ease again. It wasn‚Äôt any one thing. It was all of it. It was the dimness of the office and the glaring red eye staring out from the face of the receiver. It was the idea that the radio hadn‚Äôt been on an hour ago, when Danny had stood in the open office door zipping his jacket. It was the thought that someone had recently passed through the office and might still be close by, maybe watching from the darkness of the bathroom, where the door was open a crack‚Äîa paranoid thing to think and unlike him, but in his head all the same. He reached for the power button on the stereo, not really listening anymore, his gaze on that door. He wondered what he would do if it started to open.  
  
¬† The weatherman said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶cold and dry as the front pushes the warm air south. The dead pull the living down. Down into the cold. Down into the hole. You will di‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Jude‚Äôs thumb hit the power button, switching off the stereo, just as he registered what was being said. He twitched, startled, and stabbed the power button again, to get the voice back, figure out what the hell the weatherman had just been going on about.  
  
¬† Except the weatherman was done talking, and it was the DJ instead: ‚Äú‚Ä¶going to freeze our asses off, but Kurt Cobain is warm in hell. Dig it.‚Äù  
  
¬† A guitar whined, a shrill, wavering sound that went on and on without any discernible melody or purpose except perhaps to drive the listener to madness. The opening of Nirvana‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Hate Myself and I Want to Die.‚Äù Was that what the weatherman had been talking about? He‚Äôd said something about dying. Jude clicked the power button once more, returning the room to stillness.  
  
¬† It didn‚Äôt last. The phone went off, right behind him, a startling burst of sound that gave Jude‚Äôs pulse another unhappy jump. He shot a look at Danny‚Äôs desk, wondering who would be calling on the office line at this hour. He shifted around behind the desk for a glance at caller ID. It was a 985 number, which he identified immediately as a prefix for eastern Louisiana. The name that came up was COWZYNSKI, M.  
  
¬† Only Jude knew, even without picking up the phone, that it wasn‚Äôt really Cowzynski, M., on the other end. Not unless a medical miracle had transpired. He almost didn‚Äôt pick up at all, but then the thought came that maybe Arlene Wade was calling to tell him Martin was dead, in which case he would have to talk to her sooner or later, whether he wanted to or not.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello, Justin,‚Äù said Arlene. She was an aunt by marriage, his mother‚Äôs sister-in-law, and a licensed physician‚Äôs assistant, although for the last thirteen months her only patient had been Jude‚Äôs father. She was sixty-nine, and her voice was all twang and warble. To her he would always be Justin Cowzynski.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow are you, Arlene?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the same as ever. You know. Me and the dog are gettin‚Äô along. Although he can‚Äôt get up so much now because he‚Äôs so fat and his knees pain him. But I‚Äôm not callin‚Äô to tell you about myself or the dog. I‚Äôm callin‚Äô about your father.‚Äù  
  
¬† As if there could  
be anything else she might call about. The line hissed with white noise. Jude had been interviewed over the phone by a radio personality in Beijing and taken calls from Brian Johnson in Australia, and the connections had been as crisp and clear as if they were phoning him from down the street. But for some reason calls from Moore‚Äôs Corner, Louisiana, came in scratchy and faint, like an AM radio station that‚Äôs just a little too far away to be received perfectly. Voices from other phone calls would bleed in and out, faintly audible for a few moments and then gone. They might have high-speed Internet connections in Baton Rouge, but in the little towns in the swamps north of Lake Pontchartrain, if you wanted a high-speed connection with the rest of the world, you souped up a car and got the fuck out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLast few months I been spoonin‚Äô him food. Soft stuff he don‚Äôt have to chew. He was likin‚Äô them little stars. Pastina. And vanilla custard. I never met a dyin‚Äô person yet didn‚Äôt want some custard on their way out the door.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised. He never used to have a sweet tooth. Are you sure?

1locbuy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1locbuy,Restoring hand-made coffee table,"Hello everyone. I am wanting to restore this coffee table that I inherited from my grandma that I was told my grandpa made for her in the 70s or 80s. I want to preface this by saying I am a complete beginner with furniture restoration, and my experience is limited to sanding and painting polyurethane finish on an old side table. I really don‚Äôt know much about the proper steps needed to make a refinished piece of furniture look good and last. I know I can google some things but wanted to see if anyone could me tips on this specific piece!

As you can see the table top has a lot of deep scratches. There is a crack through the wood that looks like it has been repaired with wood glue at some point. My plan is to sand everything down, restain, and repaint the little leaf details. Potentially fill in deeper scratches with wood filler if that‚Äôs necessary. I‚Äôm not sure if the big crack is reparable, but if it is I would like to do that. And then seal it with some kind of finish that provides a similar shiny texture as it currently has. 

I love this coffee table and I want to bring it back to it‚Äôs original beauty! It‚Äôs honestly impressive to me how well it‚Äôs lasted (besides the crack), considering it was in my grandma‚Äôs living room with 20+ grandkids climbing all over it for as long as I can remember. It still feels very sturdy. 

Any tips or pointers would be greatly appreciated!!",2,1751301573.0,furniturerestoration,0,1.0,False

1locbfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/JohnAndCarolyn/comments/1locbfe/extremely_detailed_timeline_of_john_and_carolyns/,"Extremely detailed timeline of John and Carolyn's last week alive (July 9-July 16, 1999)","**Friday, July 9**: Carolyn invited close friends Christiane Amanpour and her husband, Jamie Rubin, to the Vineyard to help cheer everyone up. Christiane and her husband fly up on Friday. John flew his own plane up accompanied by a co-pilot from Caldwell NJ to MV. John and Carolyn go with Christiane and Jamie into town after dinner.

According to the NTSB John flew Essex County Airport (Caldwell, NJ, USA) to Martha's Vineyard on 7/9/99.

**Saturday, July 10:**¬†The weekend was spent with Christiane Amanpour, James Rubin, Anthony, and Carole Radziwill. ‚Äú*We spent the days on the beach and had fun dinners*,‚Äù Carole recalled. ‚Äú*Except for the dying, it was a weekend like any other, with great friends and laughs and good food.‚Äù*¬†Christiane and Jamie provided them with a break and lightened the moment.

Evening: The couples headed out in ‚Äúthe Goat‚Äù, John‚Äôs Pontiac GTO convertible to go for drinks at a couple of island bars, the Wharf and Lamppost. Anthony did not join them because he was too weak. From Sons of Camelot: ""*John didn't like to frequent the restaurants and clubs on the island very often, since the experience almost always turned unpleasant, with one photographer or another sticking his camera at Carolyn. Saturday evening, though, the two couples headed out in ""the Goat,"" John's beloved 1969 Pontiac GTO convertible, to go for drinks at a couple of island bars, the Wharf and the Lamppost. For once people left them alone.*

*""Kissy, are you pregnant?"" John asked, as they sat drinking margaritas.*

*""No, why?"" Christiane asked*

*""Because you're not smoking,"" John said.*

*""We're trying.""*

*""Oh, don't get pregnant, Kissy,"" Carolyn said jokingly to Christiane, ""or I'll have to get pregnant.""*

At the end of the weekend, John hit the road again in search of a new publishing partner to replace Hachette. During his travels, John made sure to call Carole late every night to check in on Anthony. 

Elizabeth Beller wrote that ""*ON JULY 10, THERE was a long-scheduled dinner planned with all the Bessette women, including Lauren, Carolyn, Lisa, their aunts, and their cousins, at a restaurant in downtown Manhattan. The gathering took place,¬†but Carolyn had to cancel at the last minute, explaining that they were moving Anthony into Red Gate Farm on the Vineyard at the end of that weekend.""*

**Sunday, July 11:**  
Afternoon: John and Jamie lifted Anthony and carried him to the car and drove to the beach. They brought him to the edge of the water. 

From Sons of Camelot: ""Anthony was too weak to join the group. He could hardly stand, but John wanted him to enjoy the ocean one more time. Sunday afternoon John and Jamie lifted Anthony up and half-carried him to the car and drove to the beach. There John and Jamie helped him out and brought him to the edge of the water. John stood on one side of him and Jamie on the other, and holding Anthony up, they walked into the water. The waves buffeted them, and they grasped Anthony so he did not fall. And all the time that John was physically holding Anthony up, he was verbally putting him down. And Anthony was responding in kind, trying to top John in his withering insults.

When they got back to the house, Carolyn asked if the other guests would like to go water-skiing. Jamie thought that was a great idea, and so did John. ""You don't want to go water-skiing,"" Anthony joked. ""By the time John gets everything organized, it's going to be late, there are going to be bugs, and it's going to be a whole lot of trouble for a little spin."" By the time John got everything organized, it was late, there were bugs, and it was a whole lot of trouble for a little spin.

On Sunday everyone scatters their separate ways. Jamie and Christiane fly back to New York. According to Steven Gillon‚Äôs book, John called him on the Sunday before he died (7/11/1999) to complain that Clinton planned to seek the Democratic nomination to fill the Moynihan Senate seat.

**Monday, July 12:**

Morning: ¬†John sets out early on a business trip to Canada. John flew from Martha‚Äôs Vineyard to Buffalo NY and then to Toronto with a flight instructor to meet with potential investors Keith Stein, Leslie Marshall, and Belinda Stronach.

John met with Canadian businessman Keith Stein who recalled ""*He was sticking his head out the car window all the time,"" says Stein, ""curious about everything."" When it was time to leave, Kennedy, who had flown in on his private plane from Martha's Vineyard, Mass., with a flight instructor, talked about his love of flying.¬†He lamented that on the trip back to New York he*¬†*wouldn't have a chance to fly at night, which he especially enjoyed because of the navigation challenges*

Carole R wrote that ""Carolyn stayed behind to help her and Anthony settle into Red Gate Farm, moving a bed to the first floor for Anthony so that he could avoid climbing stairs."" From her book, ""*The following morning Carolyn is getting ready to leave. She'd rather stay, but there are things she needs to do in New York. She and Holly and I are in the bathroom upstairs, and she is blow-drying her hair. I am sitting on the edge of the bathtub, looking up at her, and she turns the blow-dryer off suddenly.""*

Carolyn returned to New York with Efigenio Pinheiro on a commercial flight and called Hamilton South soon after her arrival. South was initially supposed to have come to the Vineyard that weekend as well but stayed behind because he had met someone.

After spending a few hours in Toronto, John arrived at Buffalo NY airport from Toronto around 7:40 pm. There were some issues with US customs and John had to drive into Buffalo to get gas and then flew back to  Essex County Airport (Caldwell, NJ, USA) (noted in NTSB report). 

**Tuesday, July 13**:

Morning: John called Gary Ginsberg when he got into the office to let him know about his trip to Toronto. John wanted Gary to look into the Canadian potential partner.

John and Carolyn had a heated fight about whether or not she would attend Rory's wedding; Carolyn didn‚Äôt want to go. She was exhausted by it all‚Äîflying, the crash of the Buckeye, a declining magazine, ankle surgery, cancer surgery, and the endless requirements to keep up appearances amid all of it.

John also called his close friend Dan Samson to discuss their future business plans. He told Dan, ‚Äú*There‚Äôs a chance that things at George might still go on, but I‚Äôm resigned to the fact that this is probably the end of something I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôm looking forward to the next phase of my life*‚Äù.

Earlier that evening, John had gone on his own to a party thrown by¬†*Dazed & Confused*¬†magazine, in Tribeca. He had dinner afterward with photographer Jacques Lowe, whom he told that Keith Stein was interested in¬†*George*, but ‚Äú*only if they can run the show. I‚Äôm not about to relinquish my role in the venture. I‚Äôll shut it down before I do that*,‚Äù John said. According to Lowe, John seemed on edge. ‚Äú*Hachette‚Äôs contract with John was scheduled to lapse at the end of the year. Unless Hachette reneged, John would be forced to find a new sponsor. But the Canadians weren‚Äôt the answer.*

Carolyn was spotted by a neighborhood friend sitting alone at the bar at the Independent, on Broadway and Worth Street, three blocks from her apartment. Elizabeth Beller's book mentioned ""¬†*John‚Äôs party was only a few blocks away. Perhaps he was coming to meet her. Perhaps he wasn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúAll I remember is that she just looked so very sad,‚Äù the friend said.""*

**Wednesday, July 14**:

On Wednesday, he stopped in early at the Socrates Deli near his apartment, wearing a white shirt, tie and gray slacks, greeting the regulars in the store, making his way on crutches to a table. ""The usual, John?"" asked waiter Andy Purnan, who said he served him Wednesday. Kennedy said yes, and Purnan served him a bowl of Product 19 with bananas and strawberries, scrambled eggs, whole wheat toast, coffee, and a small orange juice. Kennedy read The New York Times as he ate.

John and Carolyn called Empire Executive car and Limousine service of Manhattan to pick them up at home and deliver them to Paramount Plaza Building, where George maintained office space on the 41st floor. John and Carolyn held a breakfast reception at George for the executive board of the Robin Hood foundation.  
  
Following the breakfast, Carolyn went shopping at Bergdorf Goodman, then picked up her sister Lauren at the midtown Manhattan office of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

That same afternoon, Carolyn and Lauren were dropped off at the Stanhope Hotel. John joined his wife and sister-in-law for lunch at Caf√© M in the Stanhope, where he had rented a conference room in an attempt to create some space between himself and David Pecker, who was always hovering at Hachette. Witnesses of the trio at lunch said that things seemed tense at first but that at some point, all three of them held hands.

Afternoon: After lunch, John returned to George offices and dealt with financial papers. It was reported John avoided his wife‚Äôs phone calls. John also called Caroline, who was leaving for Idaho the next day on a rafting trip to celebrate her and Ed‚Äôs thirteenth wedding anniversary and Ed‚Äôs fifty-fourth birthday. He told his sister that Carolyn was not going to be attending the wedding that weekend and that his marriage was imploding. He wanted her to know before the story flooded the tabloids. He apologized for being distant and suggested that they both make more of an effort to spend time together. Caroline responded graciously and compassionately. She invited John over, but he said that they could talk more after the wedding.

John also spoke with Carolyn; Richard Bradley heard him arguing with Carolyn on the phone. ‚ÄúIn startling, staccato bursts of rage, John was yelling. His yell would be followed by silence, and then John‚Äôs fury would resume. At first, I couldn‚Äôt make out the words. Then after a particularly long pause, I heard John shout, ‚ÄòW*ell, goddammit, Carolyn, you‚Äôre the reason I was up at three o‚Äôclock last night!‚Äô‚Äù*

At 4 PM, John received a call from Janet Reno‚Äôs office to discuss an upcoming interview with Reno for George magazine.

At 5 PM, John called Jacques Lowe, and recounted details of his latest altercation with Carolyn. He told Lowe that he intended to spend the next night or two at the Stanhope hotel.

Later that evening, Carolyn dropped by to see her old Greenwich Village neighbor Marlaine Selip‚Äôs daughter, Erin, there was no indication of marital trouble. Carolyn was all smiles, arriving with an armload of clothes, as she often did. Speaking of Carolyn's last visit on July 14, Erin recalled, ‚Äú*She was full of light and happy*.‚Äù Carolyn also ran into her old friend Lynn Tesoro. Tesoro recalled, ""*I saw her the Wednesday before \[she died\], and I thought she never looked better or sounded more in love.""*

Evening: John Called Gary Ginsberg and told him ""*I have a chance to get my cast off*  
*tomorrow morning. Are you okay if I miss your son‚Äôs bris*?‚Äù He said,¬†*‚ÄúIf I get my*  
*cast off, I can fly‚ÄîI don‚Äôt have to fly with an instructor*.‚Äù

John stayed in the office chatting with editors, and making phone calls until 8 pm. He left the office and headed to the Stanhope, where he checked into room 1511. Less than an hour after he arrived, a waiter showed up with his favorite turkey club sandwich and a bottle of mineral water while John reviewed some financial records for George. He wanted space to prepare materials for his potential Canadian partners and figure out how to deal with the media reaction on Monday (7/19/99) when he would announce that he was seeking a new partner for George.

Shortly before midnight, John called his friend Dan Samson but did not mention he was at the Stanhope. Dan was planning to fly into Boston on Friday, 7/16/1999 to meet with John..

After midnight, he received a visit from his ex girlfriend Julie Baker. It‚Äôs been written that he invited her over to watch a video. According to Julie, she knew over the course of his marriage what  ""*watching a video*"" meant. John had admitted to a friend a couple of months before that Julie was a temptation to him. It's been written that John would invite her over to his hotel room whenever he had a fight with his wife. She stayed for an hour or so and then left. 

**Thursday, July 15**

7:30- 8 AM: John had breakfast with Julie Baker at the Stanhope hotel's Cafe M.  John arrived at the Cafe M in the Stanhope shortly before 8 a.m. About 10 minutes later, he was joined by Julie Baker. John chose an out-of-the-way table in the corner, and sat in the alcove so that Julie's back would face the dining area. He ordered pancakes and she picked poached eggs on an English muffin. From an article ""*John and his lady friend were very deep in conversation and looked into each other's eyes as they spoke,"" reveals the eyewitness. ""He looked upset and emotional while she seemed to be soothing him gently. John hardly touched his pancakes while Julie dug into her breakfast. She was friendly to the waiter. But John avoided eye contact and stared dejectedly into his lap. At one point, when he looked like he was going to lose his composure, Julie took his hand in hers and spoke softly, but firmly. John nodded in agreement as she spoke*.‚Äù

After breakfast with Julie, John taxied to Lenox hill Hospital and his CAM Walker removed, he was given a walking cane, and a new pair of lightweight metal crutches. Steve Gillon wrote that Carolyn accompanied John to his appointment. He mentioned ""¬†*Carolyn accompanied him, and the two were very affectionate, kissing passionately while seated in a small reception area.* "" Steve said John's doctor shared that info ""*a former doctor of Kennedy‚Äôs recently told him he caught Kennedy and Bessette making out in his office a few weeks before the crash. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòJohn, get a room!‚Äô‚Äù Gillon recalls with a laugh...\*\**I think it might've actually been Julie who accompanied John to his appointment, not Carolyn. It's been years since that incident, and John's doctor probably assumed the woman with him was his wife. Just my two cents. It makes more sense because Julie was with him that morning and he was fighting with Carolyn. \*\*

He left the hospital and went to the North Moore apt for a change of clothes, and packed a weekend bag to take back with him to the hotel. A photographer snapped a photo of John with a portfolio under his arm as he returned to his TriBeCa apartment.  Still on crutches from a recent ankle injury and with his foot in a brace, John struggled along the sidewalk and sometimes grimaced with pain. After going up to his apartment, he came down two hours later. he was sighted at the Hudson Market near his home.¬†He came in on crutches about noon, drank a cup of fruit juice and some coffee, then left.  Another eyewitness recalled that John, *dressed in a dark blue business suit for his job ,was still on crutches but minus his brace-was helped into a Lincoln by his driver. ""Every time he put the slightest weight on his left foot,"" says the eyewitness, ""he winced.*

*e was still wearing the ca*

John had lunch with Steve Florio to discuss the¬†future of George. They lunched at San Domenico on Central Park South. They lunched in his usual booth.  At one point, he hobbled over on his injured ankle to hug and kiss Diane Sawyer and chat with her lunch companions, Leslie Stahl and Peggy Noonan. He told them he wasn‚Äôt letting his crutches slow him down. Restaurant co-owner Marisa May says he was in a great mood. He thanked her for always protecting his privacy. ‚ÄúRemember, I brought Carolyn \[Bessette\] here before anyone knew,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope to bring the whole family soon.‚Äù ¬†  

‚ÄúWhen I got out of the hospital, John invited me to lunch,‚Äù Florio said. ‚Äú‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt we go to San Domenico, and you can have a piece of grilled fish, and we can talk,‚Äô John said. What I thought was going to be just a friendly chat turned out to be a more substantive talk. Hachette had lost interest in¬†*George,*¬†and John wanted to know if we at Cond√© Nast would be interested in picking it up. And I said, ‚ÄòYes, we can talk about it.¬†*George*¬†is a good magazine. Let‚Äôs keep chatting over the next couple of months.‚Äô But John died before we could make a decision on¬†*George.*‚Äù

Afternoon at George: John called the edit staff into the conference room for a meeting. Then John met with the George business staff and  with Hachette‚Äôs new CEO, Jack Kliger.

From Sons of Camelot, ""Later that day John got together with the magazine staff and told them that one way or another George would continue and they would hold on to their jobs. That was John's wish, but it was by no means certain. He apologized that he had not focused on the work, blaming a personal matter that he said would soon be resolved. The best news for him that day was that the leg device came off, though he was still limping around on crutches. He chanced into McClellan, the editor of Flying, and told him how much he was looking forward to heading down to Florida again to complete his instrument training.""

John called his sister Caroline and agreed they need to do a better job staying in touch.¬†

Rosemarie called Carolyn to convince her to attend Rory's wedding, she was crying, saying, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so selfish,‚Äù.

Later that afternoon, John showed up at La Palestra, he put in a two-hour workout, says a source, and handed studio owner Pat Manocchia a set of keys to his loft, so Manocchia could spend the weekend. Pat also mentioned he helped John start his physical therapy exercises for his ankle now that his cast was removed, he also did some upper body workouts.

John was seen having dinner at Zutto's on Hudson St (a 5 minute walk from the apartment). A person who was at the same place recalled ""I sat right near him for dinner which was at Zutto's. He was seated at the corner window table. He had a big boot on his leg and crutches. He was seated with legs stretched out, wearing a nice white shirt having a lot of drinks, sitting by himself."" (if you google photos of John at the Yankees game you can see he was wearing the same white shirt)

That evening John went to Yankee Stadium with Gary Ginsberg in a town car to watch the Yankees take on the Atlanta Braves. Gary had been invited by Rupert Murdoch's sons, James and Lachlan, and Gary decided to bring John along. Baseball was never John's sport, whether to play or to watch. He needed action, and he spent most of his time talking to Gary and the Murdochs. 

They spoke at length about George, and John was even cautiously optimistic that the Murdochs might invest in the magazine. The Yankees game started at 7:35 PM and ended at 10:50 PM. During the game, John and Gary started talking about Julie, though John did not tell Gary he had seen her twice already at the Stanhope. Gary started ragging John about Julie‚Äôs clothing because John convinced him to buy some of her custom-made suits but none of them fit. responded that he had purchased four suits from her and none of them fit either. John then called Julie on his cellphone to tell her that she better get into another line of business.

Gary and John drove back to the Stanhope Hotel together. From Sons of Camelot ""Riding back to Manhattan after the game, Gary looked at his friend silhouetted in the shadows, and he sensed that something was wrong. ""So what's bugging you, John?"" Gary asked. ""What's going on?"" ""God, it's tough,"" John said, looking out into the night. ""This is like God's testing you to see how much stuff you can take in your life,"" Gary said, knowing how John felt about Anthony's dying. Gary knew John wouldn't want to talk about that, and he turned the conversation to George.

Gary Ginsberg informed one author that he saw Julie Baker waiting for John in the lobby of the Stanhope hotel when they got there. 

**Friday, July 16:**

Morning (9 AM): John had breakfast at the Stanhope Caf√© M. Ordered strawberries, orange juice, and oatmeal. There is another version of this story that mentioned John checked out of the Stanhope and had breakfast at the hotel Carlyle on Madison Ave.

John stopped at Kennedy family offices on 500 Fifth avenue to retrieve his quarterly financial statements, and¬† bumped into cousin Chris K. Lawford. According to Lawford, John had lost his crutches was dragging his broken foot.¬† Lawford wrote in his book ""*I bumped into John the following morning in the Lobby of 500 Fifth Avenue. He had just come from our family office on the seventeenth floor. I was on my way there to try and make sense of my quarterly financial report, with the hope that the accountants had gotten it wrong. He had lost the crutches and was dragging his broken foot with the heavy cast behind him like Quasimodo.*

*John:* Hey, man. What's up?

Me: Hey. Nothing. Just going to do battle with the accountants.

John: Make sure they don't put any of my money in your account.

Me: Not a bad idea. When are you going to Rory's wedding?

John: I'm flying up this afternoon. Do you want to come with us?

Me: I would, but I left Jeannie on the Island with my mother and sisters. We're going to fly up tomorrow.

John: Okay, man. I'll see you at the Cape.

Me: Yeah. I'll see you up there, man.

Carolyn still wasn‚Äôt sure that she was going to go to the wedding that morning‚ÄîRosemarie talked a few times with her. According to Rosemarie, she was crying and very upset and not feeling like she wanted to put on a brave face. ‚ÄúI just want some normal married time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exhausted.‚Äù Carolyn and John talked, and she agreed to go. She then went dress shopping.

John met with Peter Kiernan, his friend who was a partner at Goldman Sachs, at 10 AM, and they were talking about a business plan and funding for George.

Kennedy arrived for work at George on Friday morning at 10, dressed casually in khakis. The magazine's offices are on the 41st floor o fa 45 story building at 50th and Broadway It was deadline week for the September issue, and among the stories he was considering was one about Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott-Thomas, co-stars of the film Random Hearts, about a couple who meet after their spouses are killed in a plane crash.

John discussed the upcoming Rob Lowe cover with the George staff.

John also met with Kliger in his office. From Sons of Camelot ""Soon after John arrived in his office, he went in to see Kliger. John could tell that the executive had no emotional stake in whether George succeeded or not. John was going to put together his plans over the weekend and pre-sent them to Kliger. If it made sense to the CEO, Hachette would renew its partnership. If it did not, the publisher would probably go ahead and sell its share to somebody else. John knew that he had some serious Canadian investors who might be interested. He had also heard from Gary that Lachlan Murdoch had inquired about George's subscription numbers.

At about noon, John received a telephone call from Brian Calcagne, director of sales for Air Bound Aviation. Calcagne asked John if he was planning on flying the Saratoga later that day. Confirming the flight, John asked the caller to have the aircraft ready for departure by early evening. John then got a call from Robert Merena, a flight instructor who wanted to know if Kennedy needed somebody to accompany him to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard. John told the instructor he wanted to fly the plane himself. 

""I had called John approximately 1 pm to verify that he was planning to take his aircraft somewhere for the weekend. He said he was. I told him I would have it parked outside the hangar. He thanked me and said he would be out 5:30-6pm""- Brian Calcagne (NTSB)

Lunch: He went to lunch with a group of George editors and attended an afternoon staff meeting. John had lunch with Richard Bradley at Trionfo, located on the ground floor of Hachette‚Äôs offices. John had spoken of a personal family problem in a meeting the day before, apologizing for having been so preoccupied. Bradley asked John, ‚ÄúThat personal problem you were talking about in the meeting yesterday‚Äîyou okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúI am,‚Äù John replied.

Afternoon: John held an editorial meeting with the staff

Carolyn needed a new dress and spent most of the afternoon shopping in midtown Manhattan. Late in the afternoon, she went to Saks Fifth Avenue, where she found a short, black dress by Yves Saint Laurent that cost $1,640. Rosemarie¬†talked to Carolyn once more, just details of her staying at the apartment and that John was meeting Lauren in the lobby at six o‚Äôclock. Carolyn asked RMT to get her a car.

2pm: John called close friend Dan Samson.

From Sons of Camelot: ""At around two o'clock Friday, John called Dan. ""I'm running a little bit late, you know,"" he said. ""But what about that Billy thing?"" Dan asked ""I think we will have to bag it.""

John went on to tell about the newest change in plans. ""Carolyn's sister Lauren decided to come. She's going to Martha's Vineyard. So instead of coming direct, we're going to drop her off there."" That meant essentially that John had given up his friend's anniversary dinner so he could do a favor for his wife's older sister, an investment banker in New York. Carolyn was especially close to her sister, and given the fact that he had just had a rousing fight with his wife, it was probably not a bad peace offering.

4:05 pm: John sent a message to his old friend John Perry Barlow, who had just buried his mother. John praised him for staying by his mother‚Äôs side while she died. ‚ÄúI will never forget when it happened to me,‚Äù John wrote, ‚Äúand it was not something that was all that macabre.‚Äù

Late afternoon: John talked to Bob Merena¬†one of his flight instructors, and said that he didn‚Äôt need him.

4pm: John leaves George to go to the gym.¬†went to visit his old friend from Brown, Pat Manocchia, who now owned the exclusive fitness center La Palestra. As he headed toward the door, Rose reminded him that he had to meet Lauren Bessette in the lobby at six thirty. She then asked him if he was okay with her leaving at five-thirty that evening. ‚ÄúSure, Rosie, no problem. I‚Äôll call you later.‚Äù

John took a car to Pat‚Äôs Upper West Side gym. ‚ÄúWe trained a lot that last couple weeks because of his injury,‚Äù Pat recalled. ‚ÄúOn that last day, we did some soft tissue work to try to get some range of motion back.‚Äù Pat described John as ‚Äúdespondent.‚Äù He was happy to have the cast off, but he was not sure what he was going to do about George. ‚ÄúHe was demoralized by his meeting with Hachette,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt sure whether the magazine could survive or if he wanted to continue with the magazine even if it did.‚Äù Pat declined to say what, if anything, John said about his marriage.

5 pm:  ""it was not until around 5:00 P.M. when he called Billy \[Noonan\] to tell him he would not be there that night. That was typical of John, and Billy was as used to it as any of his friends. He had learned years ago to shrug it off, and add the anecdote to his endless repertoire of John stories.""

Carolyn left the nail salon no later than 5 pm according to Colin Lively who was at the same salon. According to Manhattan hair colorist Colin Lively, who sat next to Carolyn at the pedicurist and was Klein's source for the anecdote, Carolyn left the salon no later than 5 p.m.¬†

Rosemarie left a note on John's phone reminding him to meet Lauren in the lobby at 6:30. 

Before leaving the office, John went into Richard‚Äôs office to ask him about publishing a poem in the magazine, both of them thought it was a bad idea, and John returned to his office, phoned New York literary agent Sterling Lord, and John let him know the poem won‚Äôt be published. John also wrote a rejection letter and sent it to them.

John also got on the phone with Lauren Bessette and agreed to meet her at 6:30 p.m. in the lobby of his office building.¬†

Before leaving the office, he told Matt Berman ‚ÄúSee you Monday, Maestro!‚Äù

At 6:30 P.M., shortly before John left his office, John logged on to Weather Service International on his computer to check out the weather. There was lots of haze out there, but the visibility was at least five miles, and there were no storms on the horizon. John got route briefings both to Martha's Vineyard and directly to Hyannis, suggesting that he may not have been certain he was going to drop off Lauren Bessette.

6:30 pm: Lauren arrived at George. Inigo Thomas mention in Beller's book that John took Lauren upstairs to show her around George. They came into Inigo's office asking for reading recommendations for the weekend. Lauren grabbed John McCain's memoir 'Faith of my Fathers' and John chose Stephen Fry's 'Moab is My Washpot'. 

6:30 pm- 7pm: John and Lauren head out for the airport. 

around 8 PM: John and Lauren arrive at the airport in John's white Hyundai convertible. 

When John got to Teterboro airport, he called Dan Samson,¬† to say they were running late and he now estimated they would be in Hyannis around 10:00. They arrived at the airport shortly after eight and pulled into a Sunoco gas station across the street. The owner of the station thought it was too late for John to be flying. ‚ÄúHe usually showed up between five and seven,‚Äù he told Time magazine. But John showed no signs of being in a hurry. Wearing a light gray T-shirt, he made small talk with the cashier and bought a banana, a bottle of Evian, and six AA batteries. The attendant asked John how his leg felt. ‚ÄúI just got the cast off yesterday,‚Äù John responded, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs feeling better.‚Äù

After John and Lauren loaded their luggage into the cargo hold, John hobbled around the plane checking its wing flaps and fuel tanks. Just as he finished, Carolyn pulled up in a black car. 

8:15 PM: Carolyn arrived at airport in a Lincoln town car. 

8:15 PM to 8:25 PM, Kyle Bailey recalled that John and Carolyn were conversing with each other in a casual manner.

8: 25 PM: Carolyn called Carole Radziwill and told her ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting a late start, I‚Äôll call you in the morning.‚Äù  

8:30 PM: Engine ""run up check"" was performed on the plane at his parking location. 

8:38 PM: Tower at Essex County airport cleared John for takeoff. Plane departs runway 22 at CDW.

9:24 PM: John flew over Westerly, Rhode Island.

9:39 PM John radioed the Martha's Vineyard airport and said he was 13 miles from the airport and 10 miles from the coast.

9:40 pm¬†: John‚Äôs plane descent rate eventually exceeded 4,700 fpm (53 mph). The target's last radar position was recorded at 2140:34 at an altitude of 1,100 feet.

From the NTSB report: ""The witness, located approximately 9 miles to the northeast of the accident site, reported hearing a loud noise between 2145 (9:45) and 2155 (9:55). The sound was similar to a thud. She added that prior to hearing the noise, her environment was quit.¬†The noise was loud enough that she went outside attempting to determine its source""

I compiled these from various sources like books, articles, NTSB reports and interviews. Please let me know what you think :)

It's all a bit PKDian, Borgesian and Serial Experiments Lain-ian and cyberpunk... ian? Cyberpunkian. Follow three nameless, entirely undescribed characters as they mope their way through a cyberpunk dystopia while grappling with nothing more than their personal demons and the nature of reality.

Here's what some internet denizens who were \[mostly\] bribed with free copies had to say about it:

    This book is not for you if you want a coherent and face-value plot with trendy story beats; a named cast; or a novel that runs on a trivially comprehensible path from inciting events to thematic conclusions.
    
    Instead, approach this as a book of IRC-punk poetry. Of nightmares both dreamt and half-forgotten in the time it takes to drink the morning coffee you know you shouldn't drink. Of faceless dialogues between strangers who are apathetically unaware of eachother's agenda. Of events that happen, but when?
    
    Think new wave jazz fusion. You know the instruments but don't understand the sounds or melody's, but slowly you feel your foot tap, and ear worms set in.
    
    This is not as others have said just a Shadowrun novel. Its a idea of what written language can do beside what you are use to reading.
    
    It touches on so many interesting themes from questions of perception to living in today's age where everything is merely a click away. Null can be both odd and something you recognize in daily life at the same time...
    I will be purchasing Null, I found myself going back a few times just to enjoy it from the start more than once on my first read and will probably be re-reading it many times in the future as well.
    
    PKD-esque cyberpunk multistory interwoven like IRC chat. Is one embedded in the other in the next in the first? I don't know! But, I liked it!
    
    Null is not a book that holds your hand. It's written with multiple different styles, from the view of multiple different characters, at multiple different times. There's IRC logs, blog posts, psuedo-interviews, etc. There are times where I was wondering how this all fits together, and to be honest I'm still not entirely sure. But I have my theories.

I drive a decent car and I‚Äôd be happy to take you out somewhere relaxing ‚Äî a nice dinner, a quiet coffee spot, or even just a peaceful evening by the ocean.

To be transparent, I got out of a toxic relationship about four months ago. It taught me a lot about boundaries and what I value in a connection ‚Äî honesty, kindness, and mutual respect. I‚Äôve healed a lot since then and feel ready to start meeting new people with a fresh mindset.

1loc4t9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1loc4t9/asking_for_advice/,Asking for advice,"My nephew got thrown out of his divorced mom's house a year ago. He had a somewhat rough upbringing with his stepdad that ended up leaving him left out of a lot of family trips birthdays, holidays, and even School functions like dances. He was neglected in a number of ways that caused him for a large part of his upbringing to not have clean clothes and to be in an unsanitary environment, as a result, he always stunk like body odor.

 He ended up getting thrown out of high school because he missed so much school, but he was accepted to a delinquent 'last chance' high-school he attends to this day. 

Growing up, he was consistently asked by his stepdad to do chores or go to his room, and if there was any lag in conversation or unfavorable response, his stepdad would immediately tell him to give up his phone. If that didn't happen, the stepdad would grab the phone and not let go, and then basically fall on top of him until my nephew would let go of the phone. This started a pattern of violence where his stepdad would constantly wrestle things out of his hands or force him to walk a certain direction. His biological mom would slap them on the face if he argued about anything. At about the age of 17 he had inexplicably grown to 6 ft tall and his mom called the police after slapping him on the face during an argument and he shoved her back.  

Then one day he called the police on her because she slapped him on the face. On both occasions, the police said they did not want to be involved but that to my nephew, his mother is allowed to discipline if she needs to but he is not allowed to hit her back. When he turned 18, he came home from school and was making a sandwich in the kitchen. His mom told him to stop making food because she just cleaned and he casually said ""you're being crazy.""  She slapped him on the face so he slapped her back. The whole situation went nuclear and he was screamed out of the house and told never to come back. 

He ended up at his biological father's house but didn't make it a year. He was sneaking some of his dad's wine, and smoking cigarettes. His father is very allergic to smoke and had multiple conversations with him about not smoking in or around the house to which my nephew would not listen but the point of no return was my nephew getting in a car and riding off while his father was telling him that he needs to stay and listen. That's what got him thrown out of his biological father's house. 

He bounced around from friend to friend until he had worn out his welcome. It's unclear if self-awareness was lacking or he was just refusing to take the hint but I guess his friend's parents were asking him where he's planning on going next and he just wasn't taking the hint. He ended up calling me about a year ago telling me he has nowhere to go and he needs help. 

Despite struggling with a mortgage I just inherited and all around being financially strained, I took him in under the one single rule that he has to go to school and graduate. At that point it was his senior year and he had several months to turn things around. Grades were already bad at that point. Nothing was simple. Not anything. My sister, his mother that is, even made acquiring a copy of his insurance difficult when he suddenly had a toothache. I ended up paying for an emergency visit before it was revealed that they have him on Medicaid which again also was not explained why to me. In the time leading up to the end of the school year, I told him over and over that his living situation depends entirely on graduating. He ended up failing out of his senior year and I relented, did not throw him out. He's now in summer school. 

I am severely cash-strapped and am rationing the air conditioning to save on power but his biological father dropped off a giant industrial fan on a pole and he's been running it consistently. He also has a problem with switching all the lights on during the day and I have to keep reminding him to stop doing that, that I'm trying to save on power and that he doesn't need the lights on during the day. He's also been acting spoiled about food. Again being short on cash, I'm accepting charity food from charity groups around town. 

My nephew has been complaining about bread that has seeds on the bun or seeds in the bread or some of the bread I brought home he complains is too ""bougie"" for him to eat whatever that means.  The charity group gave me 30 boxes of off-brand macaroni and cheese that he refuses to eat because it doesn't say kraft on the front.  He started complaining to family members that he's going hungry and there's no food in the house. They started bringing so many groceries over that it won't fit in the cabinets or the refrigerator without compromising the food I already have and despite trying to reach out to these people, they become unreasonably angry when I try to explain to them that we have lots of food and he's being picky and complaining. 

I like to put milk in my coffee, just enough to top up the coffee and cool it down. He's been drinking 99% of the milk and putting a sliver back which isn't enough to use on anything. I've confronted him repeatedly about these issues and it's like he's never listening. That's another thing, he always has his cell phone in his hands and he has wireless earbuds with YouTube running and I never know if he's listening. 

Half the time he has one earbud in and he's listening to people playing playthroughs of video games while swearing and talking loudly and laughing and it gets on my nerves that every time I try to tell him something important he furrows his brows and in goes the earbuds. I'm beginning to near my final straw here about him. He now has summer school and his parents arranged therapy appointments. The summer school and the therapy appointments consistently overlap on the same day causing him to have to leave summer school early and go to the therapy appointments. I've tried talking with his stepdad, his biological mom, and the therapy location. Nobody cares, nobody wants to listen. I told him that he needs to talk with them about changing his schedule because missing 30 minutes of school twice a week is not acceptable. He has flippantly told me no, he's not going to talk with them about it. 

My absolute last thread of Sanity is being stretched about how 4 days a week when he's not in summer school, he's just laying around in bed all day. The room smells sweet like he's been culturing something and he's not cleaning up after himself. I've told him repeatedly that he needs to get out, walk around, do things, go to the mall, take a shower, visit friends, take the bicycle, do anything, anything! He just kind of looks at me and then looks away. 

I finally told him, new rule. You need to be out of the house for at least 2 hours every day that you don't go to school. He blew up at me and wanted to know why! I told him that he doesn't get to be a bump on a log all day long and not do anything. He yelled at me that he goes to school twice a week and goes to therapy and that should be enough! So now I'm in this weird situation where he's not listening to anything, he's inappropriately consuming food in the wrong way, he's burning electricity in ways that I've asked him not to, he's not contributing to anything in the house as far as chores or money goes, not even doing his own laundry and he smells consistently of the worst body odor, mainly refuses to shower, and now I'm trying to decide what I should do next. Everyone I associate with is telling me to throw him out but I don't know if I have the heart to do that.

I‚Äôm Stacey, and I thought I knew the people closest to me.

Today, I‚Äôm telling you a story of love, friendship... and the one truth I never saw coming.

We met in high school, back when life felt simpler, yet somehow, every little moment felt important. Joey, David, and I were in science class together. Joey and David had been best friends since kindergarten, inseparable like two sides of the same coin. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt have been more different.

Joey had a magnetic personality; an easygoing, cheerful guy who could find humor in the dullest moments. His laughter was infectious, filling even the most boring classes with life. I remember one day in chemistry when our teacher, Mr. Anderson, turned his back to the class. Joey, with his mischievous grin, quietly switched the labels on two beakers. When the teacher mixed them and the solution bubbled over unexpectedly, Joey stifled his laughter behind his hand while the whole class gasped. That was Joey; a troublemaker, but never in a mean way, always just for fun.

David, on the other hand, was different. He was meticulous, a stickler for rules, and always serious. While Joey joked his way through life, David lived by structure. He would spend hours solving complex equations, always aiming for perfection. I recall a time when we had a group project. Joey and I threw together a half-baked volcano experiment, and David, unable to accept anything less than perfect, stayed up all night perfecting the reaction. The next day, the model erupted flawlessly, spewing a controlled stream of lava-like foam. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt let us fail,‚Äù he had said with a proud, but exhausted, smile.

But despite their differences, they were fiercely loyal to each other. And somehow, I became a part of their circle.

It was a rainy afternoon when I first truly bonded with them. I had slipped in the muddy schoolyard, falling face-first into a puddle. Laughter erupted around me. Embarrassment burned my cheeks, but before I could run away, Joey appeared, extending his hand. ‚ÄúWelcome to the exclusive club of puddle divers,‚Äù he said with a wink.

David, ever the serious one, handed me a clean napkin from his lunchbox. ‚ÄúYou should be more careful, Stacey,‚Äù he said, frowning. ‚ÄúThe ground was obviously wet.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes at his lecture, but Joey‚Äôs easy laughter made me smile. From that moment on, we were a trio.

As we grew older, I couldn‚Äôt help but adore Joey more and more each day. I grew up in a household without a dad. A¬†single mom struggling to feed me and my little sister. Life was tough, and joy was scarce, I often struggled with anxiety and insecurity. But Joey always found a way to bring light into my world. He would surprise me with small, thoughtful gestures. A¬†note in my locker with a terrible pun, a stolen chocolate bar from the cafeteria when he knew I had no money to buy lunch, an impromptu dance in the middle of the hallway to cheer me up after a tough day.

And David? He was always there, too. He helped me with my homework when my mom was too exhausted to explain things. He fixed my broken watch when I thought it was beyond repair. He was my best friend!

By the time we were in our twenties, I had started imagining my future with Joey. I wanted to spend my life with him, share all the joys and sorrows, build a family together. I wasn‚Äôt sure ¬†how Joey felt about me though! Did he ever think we were more than friends? Did he ever see it in my eyes? We shared everything with each other but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to tell him how I truly felt about him. I was scared that if he didn‚Äôt feel the same way, then it would be very awkward and I might lose his friendship as well. And I definitely didn‚Äôt want that!

One summer evening, Joey invited me for a walk by the lake. The air was cool, the water shimmering under the moonlight. We laughed about old memories, about David‚Äôs strict study schedules and Joey‚Äôs constant detentions.

We sat on a bench overlooking the water, watching the tiny ripples in the moonlight.

Joey nudged me with a grin. ‚ÄúYou remember the time I tried to cook you dinner and nearly set the fire alarm off?‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúTried? You mean failed. We ended up eating cereal.‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúStill the best cereal date I ever had.‚Äù

Then his expression softened¬†¬†and he took a deep breath. ‚ÄúStacey,‚Äù he said, rubbing the back of his neck. ‚ÄúYou ever think about the future?‚Äù

I smiled. ‚ÄúAll the time. Why?‚Äù

He exhaled, his hands fidgeting. ‚ÄúBecause‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been thinking about mine. And every single version of it has you in it.‚Äù

My heart skipped a beat. ‚ÄúJoey‚Ä¶‚Äù

He pulled a small box from his pocket and opened it, revealing a simple but elegant ring. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have some grand speech, and I know I‚Äôm not the perfect guy. But I love you, Stacey. I‚Äôve loved you for as long as I can remember. Will you marry me?‚Äù

Tears welled in my eyes. ‚ÄúYes! Yes, a thousand times yes!‚Äù I threw my arms around him as laughter and joy bubbled within me.

I was on cloud 9. Joey proposed to me. He loved me just as much as I loved him! He dreamed the same dreams as I did! This was all true. My happiness knew no bounds. But that night, after Joey walked me home, I sat on my bed, staring at the ring. I was happy, so happy! But underneath that joy was something else.A quiet voice I thought I'd silenced a long time ago. Do you really deserve this?What if you ruin everything?I‚Äôd grown up believing I had to fight for every scrap of love. Joey made me feel seen, safe. But sometimes‚Ä¶ it felt like I was just borrowing that love.I told myself it was just nerves. Everyone feels anxious before big life changes, right?

As our wedding date approached, David became distant. He, who had always been the first to support us, now barely showed up. He was supposed to be Joey‚Äôs best man, but he didn‚Äôt help with any preparations. I assumed he was just busy, but deep down, I was worried.¬†David had never been so distant. I tried calling him but he always had some excuse!

I tried to throw myself into wedding prep, but sometimes I caught my reflection and barely recognized the girl in the mirror. Smiling on the outside, spiraling quietly on the inside.I didn‚Äôt tell Joey. I didn‚Äôt want him to worry.But there were nights I lay awake, wondering‚Ä¶ if I was enough. If I could be the kind of wife he deserved.

Even Amy, my sister, ¬†pulled me aside one day.‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù she asked, handing me a coffee. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just seemed‚Ä¶ a little off lately.‚ÄùI smiled and waved her off. ‚ÄúJust wedding stress. Nothing I can‚Äôt handle.‚ÄùShe nodded, but didn‚Äôt look convinced.

Joey noticed too, once. He cupped my face, worry in his eyes. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre overwhelmed, we can slow things down, okay?‚ÄùI hugged him tightly. ‚ÄúNo. I want this. I‚Äôm just tired. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

I thought I was holding it together. I didn‚Äôt realize how visible the cracks had become.

Then, one evening, the doorbell rang.

It was David.

‚ÄúHey, David. Haven‚Äôt seen you in a while. How have you been?‚Äù I asked, stepping aside to let him in.

He hesitated, his face tense. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ okay, I guess. Do you have a minute?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said, gesturing for him to sit.

‚ÄúStacey, I‚Ä¶.Im not sure how to say this. Ive been trying so hard. But I‚Äôll get to the point.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhats wrong?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt immediately answer. His eyes were closed and face expressionless.‚Äú You and Joey are my best friends. I want us all to be happy but I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not happy!‚Äù He whispered.

My stomach twisted. ¬†‚Äú David, what are you talking about?‚Äù

He clenched his fists.‚ÄúI LOVE you‚Ä¶ Stacey. Cant you see it? So many years but you never‚Ä¶..‚Äù

I could see the pain in his eyes. ‚ÄúDavid, you are my friend, my best friend. But I love Joey, ever since we met in high school. ‚Äù

¬†David stood there, his expression a mix of sadness and anger. And then he shouted,

‚Äú Why not me! I‚Äôll give you everything you ever wanted. Nobody will ever love you as much as I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúDavid!‚Äù

‚Äú I came here to give you a choice Stacey. Its me or nothing‚Äù

¬†I frowned. His sentence didn‚Äôt make any sense. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

¬†‚Äú I mean, this ends today. I cannot take this anymore.‚Äù

His eyes darkened. He looked determined now, ready to tackle the situation! But there was a strange fierce look on his face that I had never seen before. He was making me very nervous. I wanted to call Joey, so we could both talk to him, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. Here was my friend , my best friend struggling with deep emotions he had never let through before. I was lost at how I could help him. Help him get over it.

¬†‚ÄúYour relationship with Joey ends today. And if you cant do that, YOU‚Ä¶ end today!‚Äù

¬†His words snapped me back to reality. What had he just said? ‚ÄúI end today‚Äù? Before I could make any sense of that, David reached into his pocket, and my heart stopped.

A knife.

‚ÄúDavid, no!‚Äù

He grabbed my wrist. I struggled, kicked, screamed, but he was too strong. Then, pain shot through me as he slashed my wrist. My blood spilled onto the carpet, and a ringing filled my ears. My vision started to blur and I collapsed to the floor. I wanted to scream, but my voice was stuck in my throat. This was it. These were my final moments. The life that I dreamed of, was gone ¬†in an instant. What would happen of Joey when he would find what his best friend had done to his fiance? I did not want to leave. Maybe my body was limp but my soul would stick around. David cannot destroy my soul. That will live forever - with Joey! My eyes were closed now but I could see. I could see David crying and I could see him putting a note beside me, wiping the knife and pressing it in my limp hand.

The night passed. My body lay there in a pool of blood. ¬†

Morning came, and Joey found me. His screams filled the air as he dropped beside my lifeless body. His hands trembled as he picked up the note.

Dear Joey, you are my best friend, and I love you, but I cannot marry you. I have been struggling with overwhelming anxiety and doubts. I fear I won‚Äôt be the wife you deserve, and I don‚Äôt want to hold you back from a better future. ¬†I can‚Äôt go through with this. With me around, you might never find the true love of your life. The girl you really deserve. Forgive me.

Tears streamed down Joey‚Äôs face. I was cheated, and I would never get justice. This wasn‚Äôt a suicide, but David had everyone believe that it was. He¬†had stolen everything from me‚Ä¶my life, my love, my future.

But my soul remains. I watch over Joey, unseen. I scream the truth, but no one hears. I am trapped, forever wondering,¬†what life would have been like,¬†if things had been different, if my best friend hadnt killed me!",1,1751301092.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1loc2rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1loc2rk/should_you_try_the_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker/,Should you try the best cold brew coffee maker VINCI Express E23010,"Testing out the Vinci Express Cold Brew E23010 felt like stepping into the future of brewing coffee. Having a busy lifestyle means my coffee-making routines need to be quick, hassle-free, and tailored to my taste. This device promised not only speed but also a range of features that seemed tailored for coffee enthusiasts like me. Naturally, I had to find out if it lived up to the hype.

**Compact and Modern Design**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek design. Its black-and-clear finish, combined with a glass carafe, gives it a premium, modern look that fits perfectly on my kitchen counter without taking up much space. Measuring just 7 inches in depth and 4 inches in width, it‚Äôs surprisingly compact given its capacity to hold about 1.1 liters of coffee. The build quality feels solid, and the glass exterior adds a touch of elegance. With the gift-box packaging, it even doubles as a fantastic present for any coffee lover.

**Built for Coffee Lovers with Versatile Strength Settings**  
The highlight for me was its ability to brew in just five minutes. Let me tell you, for someone who‚Äôs used to waiting 12 to 24 hours for traditional cold brew, this was a game-changer. The adjustable brew strength feature, with options ranging from Light (5 minutes) to Extra Bold (25 minutes), is perfect if you‚Äôre someone who likes experimenting. I usually go for Medium or Bold, depending on my mood. The Vinci's Circle Flow technology ensures every brew is smooth and sediment-free ‚Äì something I had my doubts about initially, but it delivered spotlessly clean cold brew every single time. 

[Check Vinci Express Cold Brew E23010 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b084l54spy/)

**Ease of Use and Fully Automatic Operation**  
Operating this cold brew maker couldn‚Äôt be easier. The dials and buttons are intuitive, and the clearly labeled interface doesn‚Äôt leave room for confusion. After inserting my favorite grounds and water, all it takes is setting the brew strength and letting it work its magic. The fact that it‚Äôs fully automatic means no babysitting the process. The included reusable filter also earns bonus points from me because it‚Äôs eco-friendly and eliminates the hassle of constantly buying paper filters.

**Self-Cleaning Convenience**  
Let me admit, cleaning coffee machines has always been my least favorite part. However, the Vinci E23010 tackles this with its built-in self-cleaning feature. After brewing, all you need to do is activate the cleaning mode, and it thoroughly flushes and cleans the system. I didn‚Äôt even need to worry about leftover coffee residue as it drains everything efficiently. This feature felt like a real time-saver, especially on busier mornings.

**Strengths**  
- Quick brewing process saves hours compared to traditional cold brew methods.  
- Versatile brewing settings cater to a wide range of taste preferences.  
- Compact size fits in small spaces while still offering a generous capacity.  
- The self-cleaning cycle simplifies maintenance dramatically.  

**Critiques**  
- Limited to cold brew coffee, which might not be ideal if you prefer hot coffee as well.  
- Somewhat higher learning curve for first-time automatic machine users.  
- The glass carafe, while elegant, makes me slightly nervous about potential breakage.  

**Peer Products**  
While testing the Vinci Express Cold Brew, I couldn‚Äôt help but think about other cold brew coffee makers I‚Äôve used. Compared to the Toddy Cold Brew System, which takes up a good 24 hours for brewing, this product is leagues ahead in speed alone. Products like the OXO Cold Brew Maker give you sediment-free coffee as well, but they‚Äôre more hands-on and occupy more space. However, for those deeply invested in artisanal coffee-making, the OXO‚Äôs process might appeal more. The Vinci seems perfectly suited for someone like me who values convenience and speed, but I‚Äôll admit the OXO might have a better build for large households. 

**Smart Spending**  
With the features that the Vinci Express Cold Brew brings to the table, it feels like a worthwhile splurge. You‚Äôre essentially saving hours every time you make cold brew, and the automatic cleaning is a perk that makes life so much easier. While it does feel a little pricier than manual devices, the added convenience and quality are major reasons I‚Äôd recommend it to busy individuals or smaller households. Plus, considering how many pricey cold brews I used to buy from cafes, this device is budget-friendly in the long run.

A partition will be extended through the building & the grocery business of F. C. Allen will be continued in the building facing Rutherford Street.

According to his marriage announcement in the local newspaper & dated August 1, 1918, Mr. Liles was stated to be a prominent businessman of Wadesboro, being manager of ‚ÄúThe Liles Company.‚Äù His bride, Miss Annie Harper Liles had been a teacher employed with the Wadesboro Graded School System for several years.

Mr. Joseph Marshall Liles, Sr. was born on May 28, 1879 to Nelson Pickett Liles & Susan Aycock Liles, at the ancestral home that was built in 1839. His obituary does not mention where in Anson County, his ancestral home was located. Mr. Joseph M. Liles was educated at the historical Gould's Fork Academy in the 1880's, near ""Coffee Pot"" Road, outside of Wadesboro, near the School Bus Garage. Mr. Liles also attended Polkton Academy & North Carolina State College. Years later Mr. Liles would serve for 25 years as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Brown Creek Soil & Water Conversation District, which would be the first such district established in the United States. During World War II Mr. Liles served on many ""Rationing Boards."" For 14 years he was a member of the Town Board of Commissioners.

Mr. Joseph Marshall Liles, Sr. died at Anson County Hospital on January 31, 1964 & was buried at Eastview Cemetery on Old Lilesville Road.

The 1920 census, 1930 census, 1940 census & 1950 census of Wadesboro Township list Mr. Liles as a Wadesboro merchant, so I presume that ""The Liles Company"" was in business for nearly 50 years. Please correct me if I am wrong. Thank you.

1loc1vf,https://i.redd.it/39ecx6ktc3af1.jpeg,"I lost my mom three years ago today, and I‚Äôd like to tell you about her.","A few years ago her Kohl‚Äôs account got hacked and someone used her store card. We called customer service and mom had to confirm that she wasn‚Äôt the one who purchased the items - baby clothes and a car seat. She told them no, she didn‚Äôt purchase that stuff, but was there any way she could allow the thief to keep the items? Because if someone stole a credit card to buy baby supplies then they must really need them, she reasoned.

That‚Äôs the kind of person she was. Her first impulse was always to be kind, generous, helpful. And it was genuine! And because she was so good she believed other people were good too, no matter how many times they showed her otherwise. That makes her sound naive, I know, but she was brilliant. 

She was a teacher, then a journalist, then an editor at a major educational publishing house. You know those readers they give to elementary school kids, with the short stories to help learn reading comprehension and whatnot? She wrote some of those stories. Children will learn to read using her words for years to come, which is so fitting - some of my strongest and fondest memories are of her teaching me and reading with me. She claims I could read at 17 months old, which sounds sketch but I think if anyone could have made it happen it would‚Äôve been her. 

She was the mom all our friends trusted. Our door was always open to the neighborhood kids, and there was always a place at the table if they needed to eat. It was known that if any of our friends needed to get away from a bad home life they could stay with us, no questions.  

She was the oldest of five kids and grew up in Queens. She wore Vanderbilt perfume, the one in the swan shaped bottle, and she always smelled a little like coffee and Maybelline powder. She wore blazers with shoulder pads and had fluffy dark curls. She carried a big overstuffed wallet and a leather backpack. She wore practical shoes. 

We had our struggles and she wasn‚Äôt perfect, of course. We didn‚Äôt get along when I was a kid but became close as I grew up. She was someone I‚Äôd have wanted to be friends with even if she wasn‚Äôt my mom. I was fortunate to have her in my life, and I miss her every day.

1lobzc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/whitesox/comments/1lobzc4/when_will_ishbias_influence_be_felt_in_free_agency/,When will Ishbia‚Äôs influence be felt in free agency?,"I‚Äôll start off by saying a) The Sox have a complicated ownership structure and b) I haven‚Äôt been following the behind-the-scenes any more closely than seeing articles on here, so I don‚Äôt have a great grasp on what I‚Äôm talking about‚Äîcorrect me where needed. 

Now that Ishbia has started buying out shares of some of the minority owners, when do you think we‚Äôll see his financial influence kick in? The question we need to ask first is, ‚Äúwhat should the Sox be doing in free agency this offseason?‚Äù 

The smartest thing to do, unfortunately, is repeat the last two seasons of signing possibly-useful vets to flip at the deadline while the next wave of youth trickles in from Charlotte or Birmingham. It would suck to have to do it three years in a row, but on paper my gut tells me it‚Äôs the smart decision. Taking another year to evaluate this group of talent would be very helpful towards determining positions of need‚Äîbut I‚Äôll say it‚Äôs remarkable how much clearer those positions are now than, say, a year ago. 

On the other hand, there‚Äôs a bit of tension between the front office and the fanbase, as well as between FAs and the reputation of our team as a workplace. Things seem to be trending in the right direction, but I think most here would agree that the organization won‚Äôt truly overhaul until Jerry is completely bought out, likely until he‚Äôs no longer with us. Ishbia obviously knows this, and like any new owner he‚Äôll want to make a statement signing and show the fans he‚Äôs here to win. He‚Äôll also want to show the players that the workplace reputation of recent years is being thoughtfully improved. As fans we‚Äôll be a lot less privy to this part. 

The real heart of this discussion is trifold. 

Can Ishbia exert influence in his current position? If he wanted to write Kyle Tucker a blank check would Jerry allow it? Let‚Äôs say he wants to pay for the entire contact out of his own pocket. Is Jerry‚Äôs stinginess part of his moral ethos or does he just want to protect his own personal money? You‚Äôd think if Ishbia wanted to offer a mega-contract Jerry would allow it, right? 

But is the team in position to do this? Not as poised as some other teams, but anyone 30 or younger can certainly contribute to a much improved 2026-beyond team. Seems very unrealistic, but when you have Ishbia money unrealistic things can happen. 

Would mid-tier free agents make sense for this group? On one hand some good complimentary pieces, like a Naylor or Alonso level signing at each position of need would actually bring the team back to ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù* on paper. There‚Äôs a fine line between solid mid-tier signings and trade bait, and this path seems the most realistic/practical. 

I‚Äôve yet to have my coffee so forgive this rambling mess, but what do you all think? What will the Sox try to do for free agency this offseason? What do you want them to do? The new wave has come in a bit faster than expected, maybe the spending will too? Discuss!

About two years ago I was severly burned out, I had built and scaled an agency to 40 people, was highly competent and could get stuff done but I'm not going to lie I felt like absolute garbage on the inside. Just constantly, tired, irritable, drained and not present in anything I was doing. Also a tiny bit scared thta my own acheivemnets were no longer making me happy. 

Everyone I knew who had burned out usually did something dramatic to turn things around and while it seemed to be working for them it wasn't something I could do at teh moment due to a lot of personal circumstances and commitments. So I tried something very simple that's worked wonders for me but again I'm just sharing, I'm not an expert and am not giving anyone advice. 

I basically just made a list of little things throught my day that I thought left me feeling better. Drinking nice coffee, eating a home cooked meal made from scratch (when I had the energy) or walking in a garden. Simple stuff like that.

I noticed some of those things left me feeling better than others and I started tracking them over time to see if this worked consistently. It did. I realised just being in nature was one of the most helpful things I could do for the way I was feeling. 

So I started scheduling a set amount of hours to be spent in nature each week. Nothing crazy but small hikes on the weekends, or walking by a stream or visiting a park. Simple stuff like that but I did it deliberately and regularly (like the way you go to the gym) and strictly avoided doing anything else while I was spending this time in nature. 

I can't think of a single other thing that's helped me personally as much as this. It's like a breath of fresh air and for me and has gone of to drastically change how I decided to live my life going forward. I huess today when I sat down and looked back on this it made me quite happy and I felt like sharing it somewhere. That's all, that's the post. I love nature and want to spend every free moment I have enjoying how beautiful it is and appreciating how much it heals me. Just wnated to share :)",4,1751300552.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

KoalaEssays Gave Me the Best Assignment Help Ever,"I‚Äôm the kind of person who treats deadlines like ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù and only realizes my mistake when my to-do list looks like the instructions for defusing a bomb. Last week at 3 AM, I was staring blankly at a Word doc labeled ‚ÄúFinal Project,‚Äù muttering ‚ÄúI need assignment help‚Äù like it was my personal mantra. That‚Äôs when I discovered [https://koalaessays.net/](https://koalaessays.net/) ‚Äîhands down the best assignment help online I‚Äôve ever used. From instant quotes to live chat with my writer, it felt more like texting my study-buddy than paying for a ghostwriter.

# Why I Chose KoalaEssays

After doom-scrolling through pages of overpriced, confusing sites, I landed on KoalaEssays and saw their transparent rating system: each writer‚Äôs star rating, number of completed orders, and average turnaround time laid out like a menu. No more lottery of ‚ÄúWill my paper suck or win a Nobel?‚Äù Next, I tried out their direct author chat‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt talking to a canned ‚Äúsupport team,‚Äù but a real person who asked about my voice, my preferred citation style, and even whether I like my jokes cheesy or dry. Pricing? Let‚Äôs just say I didn‚Äôt have to choose between groceries and assignment help services‚Äîtheir tiered options fit my broke-but-desperate student budget perfectly. In the world of professional assignment help, KoalaEssays truly stands out.

# My ‚ÄúMagical‚Äù Writer Experience

Once I hit ‚Äúorder,‚Äù my writer‚Äîpinged me within minutes. We traded my half-baked ideas, random memes, and a Google Drive folder packed with lecture slides. Two days later, I opened the draft and did a double-take: it sounded exactly like me, but smarter. Seriously, it could‚Äôve been my own 2 AM brainchild. They incorporated my quirky humor, parenthetical asides, and even that weird semi-colon obsession I try to hide. If this isn‚Äôt the best assignment help, I don‚Äôt know what is.

# Transparent Ratings & Wallet-Friendly Prices

What sets [https://koalaessays.net/](https://koalaessays.net/) apart from other services is the no-BS feedback loop. After delivery, I dropped an honest 5-star review, noting grammar, style, and punctuality. Future students can see real comments‚Äîno fake accounts inflating scores. And if you‚Äôre pinching pennies, their ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù package covers the basics, while ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù throws in plagiarism reports, writing assignment help tweaks, and unlimited revisions. Compared to those ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù luxury services that cost as much as a used car, this is pure student gold.

# More Than Just Assignments

Just when I thought it was a one-trick pony, I dug deeper and saw they offer everything from PowerPoint slides and lab reports to dissertations and business plans. Need a case-study summary at 4 AM? They‚Äôve got you. Want a CV refresh or a cover letter that doesn‚Äôt read like a robot wrote it? Sure thing. It‚Äôs like discovering your favorite pizza place also delivers sushi and gelato‚Äîdelightfully unexpected.

# Confessions of a Serial Procrastinator

Let‚Äôs be real: I‚Äôm the academic version of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it later,‚Äù and that ‚Äúlater‚Äù always ends with sweatpants and stale coffee. I‚Äôve cried into my keyboard more times than I care to admit. But thanks to KoalaEssays‚Äô professional assignment help, I went from panic mode to peace of mind. Instead of sobbing over instant noodles at midnight, I was sipping tea and rereading my flawless project.

1lobujn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lobujn/duma_key_by_stephen_king/,Duma Key by Stephen King:,"¬† **1--My Other Life**  
  
¬†My name is Edgar Freemantle. I used to be a big deal in the building and contracting business. This was in Minnesota, in my other life. I learned that my-other-life thing from Wireman. I want to tell you about Wireman, but first let's get through the Minnesota part.  
  
¬† Gotta say it: I was a genuine American-boy success there. Worked my way up in the company where I started, and when I couldn't work my way any higher there, I went out and started my own. The boss of the company I left laughed at me, said I'd be broke in a year. I think that's what most bosses say when some hot young pocket-rocket goes off on his own.  
  
¬† For me, everything worked out. When Minneapolis-St. Paul boomed, The Freemantle Company boomed. When things tightened up, I never tried to play big. But I did play my hunches, and most played out well. By the time I was fifty, Pam and I were worth forty million dollars. And we were still tight. We had two girls, and at the end of our particular Golden Age, Ilse was at Brown and Melinda was teaching in France, as part of a foreign exchange program. At the time things went wrong, my wife and I were planning to  
go and visit her.  
  
¬† I had an accident at a job site. It was pretty simple; when a pickup truck, even a Dodge Ram with all the bells and whistles, argues with a twelve-story crane, the pickup is going to lose every time. The right side of my skull only cracked. The left side was slammed so hard against the Ram's doorpost that it fractured in three places. Or maybe it was five. My memory is better than it used to be, but it's still a long way from what it once was.  
  
¬† The doctors called what happened to my head a contracoup injury, and that kind of thing often does more damage than the original hit. My ribs were broken. My right hip was shattered. And although I retained seventy per cent of the sight in my right eye (more, on a good day), I lost my right arm.  
  
¬† I was supposed to lose my life, but didn't. I was supposed to be mentally impaired thanks to the contracoup thing, and at first I was, but it passed. Sort of. By the time it did, my wife had gone, and not just sort of. We were married for twenty-five years, but you know what they say: shit happens. I guess it doesn't matter; gone is gone. And over is over. Sometimes that's a good thing.  
  
¬† When I say I was mentally impaired, I mean that at first I didn't know who people were--even my wife--or what had happened. I couldn't understand why I was in such pain. I can't remember the quality of that pain now, four years later. I know that I suffered it, and that it was excruciating, but it's all pretty academic. It wasn't academic at the time. At the time it was like being in hell and not knowing why you were there.  
  
¬† At first you were afraid you'd die, then you were afraid you wouldn't. That's what Wireman says, and he would have known; he had his own season in hell.  
  
¬† Everything hurt all the time. I had a constant ringing headache; behind my forehead it was always midnight in the world's biggest clock-shop. Because my right eye was fucked up, I was seeing the world through a film of blood, and I hardly knew what the world was. Nothing had a name. I remember one day when Pam was in the room--I was still in the hospital--and she was standing by my bed. I was extremely pissed that she should be standing when there was a thing to sit on right over in the cornhole.  
  
¬† ""Bring the friend,"" I said. ""Sit in the friend.""  
  
¬† ""What do you mean, Edgar?"" she asked.  
  
¬† ""The friend, the buddy!"" I shouted. ""Bring over the fucking pal, you dump bitch!"" My head was killing me and she was starting to cry. I hated her for that. She had no business crying, because she wasn't the one in the cage, looking at everything through a red blur. She wasn't the monkey in the cage. And then it came to me. ""Bring over the chum and sick down!"" It was the closest my rattled, fucked-up brain could come to chair.  
  
¬† I was angry all the time. There were two older nurses that I called Dry Fuck One and Dry Fuck Two, as if they were characters in a dirty Dr. Seuss story. There was a candystriper I called Pilch Lozenge--I have no idea why, but that nickname also had some sort of sexual connotation. To me, at least. When I grew stronger, I tried to hit people. Twice I tried to stab Pam, and on one of those two occasions I succeeded, although only with a plastic knife. She still needed a couple of stitches in her forearm. There were times when I had to be tied down.  
  
¬† Here is what I remember most clearly about that part of my other life: a hot afternoon toward the end of my month-long stay in an expensive convalescent home, the expensive air conditioning broken, tied down in my bed, a soap opera on the television, a thousand midnight bells ringing in my head, pain burning and stiffening my right side like a poker, my missing right arm itching, my missing right fingers twitching, no more Oxycontin due for awhile (I don't know how long, because telling time is beyond me), and a nurse swims out of the red, a creature coming to look at the monkey in the cage, and the nurse says: ""Are you ready to visit with your wife?"" And I say: ""Only if she brought a gun to shoot me with.""  
  
¬† You don't think that kind of pain will pass, but it does. Then they ship you home and replace it with the agony of physical rehabilitation. The red began to drain from my vision. A psychologist who specialized in hypnotherapy showed me some neat tricks for managing the phantom aches and itches in my missing arm. That was Kamen. It was Kamen who brought me Reba: one of the few things I took with me when I limped out of my other life and into the one I lived on Duma Key.  
  
¬† ""This is not approved psychological therapy for anger management,"" Dr. Kamen said, although I suppose he might have been lying about that to make Reba more attractive. He told me I had to give her a hateful name, and so, although she looked like Lucy Ricardo, I named her after an aunt who used to pinch my fingers when I was small if I didn't eat all my carrots. Then, less than two days after getting her, I forgot her name. I could only think of boy names, each one making me angrier: Randall, Russell, Rudolph, River-fucking-Phoenix.  
  
¬† I was home by then. Pam came in with my morning snack and must have seen the look on my face, because I could see her steeling herself for an outburst. But even though I'd forgotten the name of the fluffy red rage-doll the psychologist had given me, I remembered how I was supposed to use it in this situation.  
  
¬† ""Pam,"" I said, ""I need five minutes to get myself under control. I can do this.""  
  
¬† ""Are you sure--""  
  
¬† ""Yes, now just get that hamhock out of here and stick it up your face-powder. I can do this.""  
  
¬† I didn't know if I really could, but that was what I was supposed to say. I couldn't remember the fucking doll's name, but I could remember I can do this. That's clear about the end of my other life, how I kept saying I can do this even when I knew I couldn't, even when I knew I was fucked, I was double-fucked, I was dead-ass-fucked in the pouring rain.  
  
¬† ""I can do this,"" I said, and God knows how I looked because she backed out without a word, the tray still in her hands and the cup chattering against the plate.  
  
¬† When she was gone, I held the doll up in front of my face, staring into its stupid blue eyes as my thumb disappeared into its stupid yielding body. ""What's your name, you bat-faced bitch?"" I shouted at it. It never once occurred to me that Pam was listening on the kitchen intercom, she and the day-nurse both. Tell you what, if the intercom had been broken they could have heard me through the door. I was in good voice that day.  
  
¬† I began to shake the doll back and forth. Its head flopped and its synthetic I Love Lucy hair flew. Its big blue cartoon eyes seemed to be saying Oouuu, you nasty man! like Betty Boop in one of those old cartoons you can still see sometimes on the cable.  
  
¬† ""What's your name, bitch? What's your name, you cunt? What's your name, you cheap rag-filled whore? Tell me your name! Tell me your name! Tell me your name or I'll cut out your eyes and chop off your nose and rip out your--""  
  
¬† My mind cross-connected then, a thing that still happens now, four years later, down here in the town of Tamazunchale, state of San Luis Potosi, country of Mexico, site of Edgar Freemantle's third life. For a moment I was in my pickup truck, clipboard rattling against my old steel lunchbucket in the passenger footwell (I doubt if I was the only working millionaire in America to carry a lunchbucket, but you probably could have counted us in the dozens), my PowerBook beside me on the seat. And from the radio a woman's voice cried ""It was RED!"" with evangelical fervor. Only three words, but three was enough. It was the song about the poor woman who turns out her pretty daughter as a prostitute. It was ""Fancy,"" by Reba McEntire.  
  
¬† ""Reba,"" I whispered, and hugged the doll against me. ""You're Reba. Reba-Reba-Reba. I'll never forget again."" I did--the following week--but I didn't get angry that time. No. I held her against me like a little love, closed my eyes, and visualized the pickup truck that had been demolished in the accident. I visualized my steel lunchbucket rattling against the steel clip on my clipboard, and the woman's voice came from the radio once more, exulting with that same evangelical fervor: ""It was RED!""  
  
¬† Dr. Kamen called it a breakthrough. He was excited. My wife seemed a good deal less excited, and the kiss she put on my cheek was of the dutiful variety. I think it was two months later that she told me she wanted a divorce.  
  
¬† ii  
  
¬† By then the pain had either lessened or my mind had made  
certain crucial adjustments when it came to dealing with it. The headaches still came, but less often and rarely with the same violence; it was no longer always midnight in the world's biggest clock-shop between my ears. I was always more than ready for Vicodin at five and Oxycontin at eight--could hardly hobble on my bright red Canadian crutch until I'd swallowed those magic pills--but my rebuilt hip was starting to mend.  
  
¬† Kathi Green the Rehab Queen came to Casa Freemantle in Mendota Heights on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I was allowed an extra Vicodin before our sessions, and still my screams filled the house by the time we finished up. Our basement rec room had been converted into a therapy suite, complete with a handicap-accessible hot tub. After two months of torture, I was able to make it down there on my own in the evenings to double up on my leg exercises and begin some abdominal work. Kathi said doing that stuff a couple of hours before bed would release endorphins and I'd sleep better.  
  
¬† It was during one of these evening workouts--Edgar in search of those elusive endorphins--when my wife of a quarter-century came downstairs and told me she wanted a divorce.  
  
¬† I stopped what I was doing--crunches--and looked at her. I was sitting on a floor-pad. She was standing at the foot of the stairs, prudently across the room. I could have asked her if she was serious, but the light down there was very good--those racked fluorescents--and I didn't have to. I don't think it's the sort of thing women joke about six months after their husbands have almost died in accidents, anyway. I could have asked her why, but I knew. I could see the small white scar on her arm where I had stabbed her with the plastic knife from my hospital supper tray, and that was really the least of it. I thought of telling her, not so long ago, to get that hamhock out of here and stick it up her face-powder. I considered asking her to at least think about it, but the anger came back. In those days what Dr. Kamen called inappropriate anger was my ugly friend. And hey, what I was feeling right then did not seem inappropriate at all.  
  
¬† My shirt was off. My right arm ended three and a half inches below the shoulder. I twitched it at her--a twitch was the best I could do with the muscle that was left. ""This is me,"" I said, ""giving you the finger. Get out of here if that's how you feel. Get out, you quitting birch.

¬† The first tears had started rolling down her face, but she tried to smile. It was a pretty ghastly effort. ""Bitch, Edgar,"" she said. ""The word is bitch.""  
  
¬† ""The word is what I say it is,"" I said, and began to do crunches again. It's harder than hell to do them with an arm gone; your body wants to pull and corkscrew to that side. ""I wouldn't have left you, that's the point. I wouldn't have left you. I would have gone on through the mud and the blood and the piss and the spilled beer.""  
  
¬† ""It's different,"" she said. She made no effort to wipe her face. ""It's different and you know it. I couldn't break you in two if I got into a rage.""  
  
¬† ""I'd have a hell of a job breaking you in two with only one amp,"" I said, doing crunches faster.  
  
¬† ""You stuck me with a knife."" As if that were the point. It wasn't, and we both knew it.  
  
¬† ""A plastic rudder knife is what it was, I was half out of my mind, and it'll be your last words on your fucking beth-dead, 'Eddie staffed me with a plastic fife, goodbye cruel world.' ""  
  
¬† ""You choked me,"" she said in a voice I could barely hear.  
  
¬† I stopped doing crunches and gaped at her. The clock-shop started up in my head; bang-a-gong, get it on. ""What are you saying, I choked you? I never choked you!""  
  
¬† ""I know you don't remember, but you did. And you're not the same.""  
  
¬† ""Oh, quit it. Save the New Age bullshit for the . . . for the guy . . . your . . ."" I knew the word and I could see the man it stood for, but it wouldn't come. ""For that bald fuck you see in his office.""  
  
¬† ""My therapist,"" she said, and of course that made me angrier: she had the word and I didn't. Because her brain hadn't been shaken like Jell-O.  
  
¬† ""You want a divorce, you can have a divorce. Throw it all away, why not? Only go do the alligator somewhere else. Get out of here.""  
  
¬† She went up the stairs and closed the door without looking back. And it wasn't until she was gone that I realized I'd meant to say crocodile tears. Go cry your crocodile tears somewhere else.  
  
¬† Oh, well. Close enough for rock and roll. That's what Wireman says.  
  
¬† And I was the one who ended up getting out.  
  
¬† iii  
  
¬† Except for Pam, I never had a partner in my other life. Edgar Freemantle's Four Rules for Success (feel free to take notes) were: never borrow more than your IQ times a hundred, never borrow from a man who calls you by your first name on first acquaintance, never take a drink while the sun's still up, and never take a partner you wouldn't be willing to embrace naked on a waterbed.  
  
¬† I did have an accountant I trusted, however, and it was Tom Riley who helped me move the few things I needed from Mendota Heights to our smaller place on Lake Phalen. Tom, a sad two-time loser in the marriage game, worried at me all the way out. ""You don't give up the house in a situation like this,"" he said. ""Not unless the judge kicks you out. It's like giving up home field advantage in a playoff game.""  
  
¬† I didn't care about home field advantage; I only wanted him to watch his driving. I winced every time a car coming the other way looked a little too close to the centerline. Sometimes I stiffened and pumped the invisible passenger brake. As for getting behind the wheel again myself, I thought never sounded about right. Of course, God loves surprises. That's what Wireman says.  
  
¬† Kathi Green the Rehab Queen had only been divorced once, but she and Tom were on the same wavelength. I remember her sitting cross-legged in her leotard, holding my feet and looking at me with grim outrage.  
  
¬† ""Here you are, just out of Death's Motel and short an arm, and she wants to call it off. Because you poked her with a plastic hospital knife when you could barely remember your own name? Fuck me til I cry! Doesn't she understand that mood-swings and short-term memory loss following accident trauma are common?""  
  
¬† ""She understands that she's scared of me,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""Yeah? Well, listen to your Mama, Sunny Jim: if you've got a good lawyer, you can make her pay for being such a wimp."" Some hair had escaped from her Rehab Gestapo ponytail and she blew it back from her forehead. ""She ought to pay for it. Read my lips: None of this is your fault.""  
  
¬† ""She says I tried to choke her.""  
  
¬† ""And if so, being choked by a one-armed invalid must have been a pants-wetting experience. Come on, Eddie, make her pay. I'm sure I'm stepping way out of my place, but I don't care. She should not be doing what she's doing.""  
  
¬† ""I think there's more to it than the choking thing and the butter-knife thing.""  
  
¬† ""What?""  
  
¬† ""I can't remember.""  
  
¬† ""What does she say?""  
  
¬† ""She doesn't."" But Pam and I had been together a long time, and even if love had run out into a delta of passive acceptance, I thought I still knew her well enough to know that yes--there had been something else, there was still something else, and that was what she wanted to get away from.  
  
¬† iv  
  
¬† Not long after I relocated to the place on Lake Phalen, the girls came to see me--the young women. They brought a picnic hamper. We sat on the piney-smelling lakeporch, looked out at the lake, and nibbled sandwiches. It was past Labor Day by then, most of the floating toys put away for another year. There was also a bottle of wine in the hamper, but I only drank a little. On top of the pain medication, alcohol hit me hard; a single beer could turn me into a slurring drunk. The girls--the young women--finished the rest between them, and it loosened them up. Melinda, back from France for the second time since my argument with the crane and not happy about it, asked me if all adults in their fifties had these unpleasant regressive interludes, did she have that to look forward to. Ilse, the younger, began to cry, leaned against me, and asked why it couldn't be like it was, why couldn't we--meaning her mother and me--be like we were. Lin told her this wasn't the time for Illy's patented Baby Act, and Illy gave her the finger. I laughed. I couldn't help it. Then we all laughed.  
  
¬† Lin's temper and Ilse's tears weren't pleasant, but they were honest, and as familiar to me as the mole on Ilse's chin or the faint vertical frown-line, which in time would deepen into a groove, between Lin's eyes.  
  
¬† Linnie wanted to know what I was going to do, and I told her I didn't know. I'd come a long distance toward deciding to end my own life, but I knew that if I did it, it must absolutely look like an accident. I would not leave these two young women, just starting out in their lives, carrying the residual guilt of their father's suicide. Nor would I leave a load of guilt behind for the woman with whom I had once shared a milkshake in bed, both of us naked and laughing and listening to the Plastic Ono Band on the stereo.  
  
¬† After they'd had a chance to vent--after a full and complete exchange of feelings, in Dr. Kamen-speak--my memory is that we had a pleasant afternoon, looking at old photo albums and reminiscing about the past. I think we even laughed some more, but not all memories of my other life are to be trusted. Wireman says when it comes to the past, we all stack the deck.  
  
¬† Ilse wanted us all to go out to dinner, but Lin had to meet someone at the Public Library before it closed, and I said I didn't feel much like hobbling anywhere; I thought I'd read a few chapters of the latest John Sandford and then go to bed. They kissed me--all friends again--and then left.  
  
¬† Two minutes later, Ilse came back. ""I told Linnie I forgot my keys,"" she said.  
  
¬† ""I take it you didn't,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""No. Daddy, would you ever hurt Mom? I mean, now? On purpose?""  
  
¬† I shook my head, but that wasn't good enough for her. I could tell by the way she just stood there, looking me in the eye. ""No,"" I said. ""Never. I'd--""  
  
¬† ""You'd what, Daddy?""  
  
¬† ""I was going to say I'd cut my own arm off first, but all at once that seemed like a really bad idea. I'd never do it, Illy. Leave it at that.""  
  
¬† ""Then why is she still afraid of you?""  
  
¬† ""I think . . . because I'm maimed.""  
  
¬† She hurled herself into my arms so hard she almost knocked us both onto the sofa. ""Oh, Daddy, I'm so sorry. All of this is just so sucky.""  
  
¬† I stroked her hair a little. ""I know, but remember this--it's as bad as it's going to get."" That wasn't the truth, but if I was careful, Ilse woul  
d never know it had been an outright lie.  
  
¬† A horn honked from the driveway.  
  
¬† ""Go on,"" I said, and kissed her wet cheek. ""Your sister's impatient.""  
  
¬† She wrinkled her nose. ""So what else is new? You're not overdoing the pain meds, are you?""  
  
¬† ""No.""  
  
¬† ""Call if you need me, Daddy. I'll catch the very next plane.""  
  
¬† She would, too. Which was why I wouldn't.  
  
¬† ""You bet."" I put a kiss on her other cheek. ""Give that to your sister.""  
  
¬† She nodded and went out. I sat down on the couch and closed my eyes. Behind them, the clocks were striking and striking and striking.  
  
¬† v  
  
¬† My next visitor was Dr. Kamen, the psychologist who gave me Reba. I didn't invite him. I had Kathi, my rehabilitation dominatrix, to thank for that.  
  
¬† Although surely no more than forty, Kamen walked like a much older man and wheezed even when he sat, peering at the world through enormous horn-rimmed spectacles and over an enormous pear of a belly. He was a very tall, very black black man, with features carved so large they seemed unreal. His great staring eyeballs, ship's figurehead of a nose, and totemic lips were awe-inspiring. Xander Kamen looked like a minor god in a suit from Men's Warehouse. He also looked like a prime candidate for a fatal heart attack or stroke before his fiftieth birthday.  
  
¬† He refused my offer of refreshment, said he couldn't stay, then put his briefcase aside on the couch as if to contradict that. He sank full fathom five beside the couch's armrest (and going deeper all the time--I feared for the thing's springs), looking at me and wheezing benignly.  
  
¬† ""What brings you out this way?"" I asked him.  
  
¬† ""Oh, Kathi tells me you're planning to bump yourself off,"" he said. It was the tone he might have used to say Kathi tells me you're having a lawn party and there are fresh Krispy Kremes on offer. ""Any truth to that rumor?""  
  
¬† I opened my mouth, then closed it again. Once, when I was ten and growing up in Eau Claire, I took a comic book from a drugstore spin-around, put it down the front of my jeans, then dropped my tee-shirt over it. As I was strolling out the door, feeling jacked up and very clever, a clerk grabbed me by the arm. She lifted my shirt with her other hand and exposed my ill-gotten treasure. ""How did that get there?"" she asked me. Not in the forty years since that day had I been so completely stuck for an answer to a simple question.  
  
¬† Finally--long after such a response could have any weight--I said, ""That's ridiculous. I don't know where she could have gotten such an idea.""  
  
¬† ""No?""  
  
¬† ""No. Sure you don't want a Coke?""  
  
¬† ""Thanks, but I'll pass.""  
  
¬† I got up and got a Coke from the kitchen fridge. I tucked the bottle firmly between my stump and my chest-wall--possible but painful, I don't know what you may have seen in the movies, but broken ribs hurt for a long time--and spun off the cap with my left hand. I'm a southpaw. Caught a break there, muchacho, as Wireman says.  
  
¬† ""I'm surprised you'd take her seriously in any case,"" I said as I came back in. ""Kathi's a hell of a physical therapist, but a headshrinker she's not."" I paused before sitting down. ""Neither are you, actually. In the technical sense.""  
  
¬† Kamen cupped an enormous hand behind an ear that looked roughly the size of a desk drawer. ""Do I hear . . . a ratcheting noise? I believe I do!""  
  
¬† ""What are you talking about?""  
  
¬† ""It's the charmingly medieval sound a person's defenses make when they go up."" He tried an ironic wink, but the size of the man's face made irony impossible; he could only manage burlesque. Still, I took the point. ""As for Kathi Green, you're right, what does she know? All she does is work with paraplegics, quadriplegics, accident-related amps like you, and people recovering from traumatic head injuries--again, like you. For fifteen years Kathi's done this work, she's had the opportunity to watch a thousand maimed patients reflect on how not even a single second of time can ever be called back, so how could she possibly recognize the signs of pre-suicidal depression?""  
  
¬† I sat in the lumpy easy chair across from the couch and stared at him sullenly. Here was trouble. And Kathi Green was more.  
  
¬† He leaned forward . . . although, given his girth, a few inches was all he could manage. ""You have to wait,"" he said.  
  
¬† I gaped at him.  
  
¬† He nodded. ""You're surprised. Yes. But I'm not a Christian, let alone a Catholic, and on the subject of suicide my mind is open. Yet I'm a believer in responsibilities, I know that you are, too, and I tell you this: if you kill yourself now . . . even six months from now . . . your wife and daughters will know. No matter how cleverly you do it, they'll know.""  
  
¬† ""I don't--""  
  
¬† He raised his hand. ""And the company that insures your life--for a very large sum, I'm sure--they'll know, too. They may not be able to prove it . . . but they'll try very hard. The rumors they start will hurt your girls, no matter how well-armored against such things you may think they are.""  
  
¬† Melinda was well-armored. Ilse, however, was a different story. When Melinda was mad at her, she called Illy a case of arrested development, but I didn't think that was true. I thought Illy was just tender.  
  
¬† ""And in the end, they may prove it."" Kamen shrugged his enormous shoulders. ""How much of a death-duty that might entail I couldn't guess, but I'm sure it would erase a great deal of your life's treasure.""  
  
¬† I wasn't thinking about the money. I was thinking about a team of insurance investigators sniffing around whatever I set up. And all at once I began to laugh.  
  
¬† Kamen sat with his huge dark brown hands on his doorstop knees, looking at me with his little I've-seen-everything smile. Except on his face nothing was little. He let my laughter run its course and then asked me what was so funny.  
  
¬† ""You're telling me I'm too rich to kill myself,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""I'm telling you not now, Edgar, and that's all I'm telling you. I'm also going to make a suggestion that goes against a good deal of my own practical experience. But I have a very strong intuition in your case--the same sort of intuition that caused me to give you the doll. I propose you try a geographical.""  
  
¬† ""Beg pardon?""  
  
¬† ""It's a form of recovery often attempted by late-stage alcoholics. They hope that a change of location will give them a fresh start. Turn things around.""  
  
¬† I felt a flicker of something. I won't say it was hope, but it was something.  
  
¬† ""It rarely works,"" Kamen said. ""The old-timers in Alcoholics Anonymous, who have an answer for everything--it's their curse as well as their blessing, although very few ever realize it--like to say, 'Put an asshole on a plane in Boston, an asshole gets off in Seattle.' ""  
  
¬† ""So where does that leave me?"" I asked.  
  
¬† ""Right now it leaves you in suburban St. Paul. What I'm suggesting is that you pick someplace far from here and go there. You're in a unique position to do so, given your financial situation and marital status.""  
  
¬† ""For how long?""  
  
¬† ""At least a year."" He looked at me inscrutably. His large face was made for such an expression; etched on King Tut's tomb, I believe it might have made even Howard Carter consider. ""And if you do anything at the end of that year, Edgar, for God's sake--no, for your daughters' sake--make it look good.""  
  
¬† He had nearly disappeared into the old sofa; now he began to struggle up again. I stepped forward to help him and he waved me away. He made it to his feet at last, wheezing more loudly than ever, and took up his briefcase. He looked down at me from his height of six and a half feet, those staring eyeballs with their yellowish corneas made even larger by his glasses, which had very thick lenses.  
  
¬† ""Edgar, does anything make you happy?""  
  
¬† I considered the surface of this question (the only part that seemed safe) and said, ""I used to sketch."" It had actually been a little more than just sketching, but that was long ago. Since then, other things had intervened. Marriage, a career. Both of which were now going or gone.  
  
¬† ""When?""  
  
¬† ""As a kid.""  
  
¬† I thought of telling him I'd once dreamed of art school--had even bought the occasional book of reproductions when I could afford to--and then didn't. In the  
last thirty years, my contribution to the world of art had consisted of little more than doodles while taking telephone calls, and it had probably been ten years since I'd bought the sort of picture-book that belongs on a coffee table where it can impress your friends.

1lobts6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lobts6/mac_daddy_coffee_maker_help_5000/,Mac Daddy Coffee Maker Help [$5000],"Hello! My boss recently tasked me with the project of picking out a new coffee maker for our office. He wants it to have multiple hoppers and he requests it to be a ‚ÄúMac daddy‚Äù machine. It‚Äôs up to your interpretation as to what that means. He really likes having options which is why I think he requested a multi hopper machine. 

Now, I‚Äôm willing to definitely hear some arguments to getting two machines. One for clients and one for our use.

This particular machine will live in our welcoming area for clients and their guests to use when they are in the office. Ideally, it will be easy to use, clean, and maintain. I think we would like it to make more than a really delicious cup of coffee (lattes? Cappuccinos?) but I‚Äôm not sure what that looks like price wise.

When I pressed him for a budget, he just threw out $5,000 USD. But, there‚Äôs flexibility there. Probably don‚Äôt recommend a $20,000 machine, but we could probably go up to $10,000.

Any and all help is much appreciated! Thank you so much! ",1,1751300401.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I took a small saucer and layered some salt, coffee grounds, and dried lemon peel in concentric circles. Then added peppercorn, nutmeg, and eggshell on top.
