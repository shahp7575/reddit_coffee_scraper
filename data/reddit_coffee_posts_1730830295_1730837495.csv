This isn‚Äôt the case with many other diseases. Today, however, I want to focus on the tragicomic side of things. **What are some of the most unintentionally bizarre, amusingly wrong questions, suggestions, or comments you‚Äôve received?** For example, I‚Äôve often been seriously asked if I‚Äôve tried drinking more coffee (I‚Äôm severe, basically housebound).

What sparked this question was a response to a post I made on a work-related subreddit, where I was asking for advice on finding an extremely flexible job that would allow me to work during the few hours a week when I feel capable of doing anything, because I‚Äôm facing financial difficulties, and getting aid is tough (I didn‚Äôt find anything interesting, btw).  I mentioned the illness I‚Äôve been dealing with for many years, my semi-vegetative state, and the fact that I often have to lie down for days, overwhelmed by illness and unable to do even the most basic tasks. And one comment in particular made me laugh: no job advice, a person simply wrote, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the same situation, I have a hernia.‚Äù

I‚Äôm at a top-15 MBA program and originally planned to dive into coffee chats as soon as I felt good about my pitch. I got some great feedback from my mentor and career office, and had strong chats with consultants across MBB and the T4 firms.

Then, two invite-only events came up, and I wasn‚Äôt invited to either. That was a surprise, so I checked in with our Consulting Association, and it turns out the second-years had a big role in selecting candidates and submitted a shortlist.

Did I mess up by not connecting with more second-years early on?

One day I guess I was just in a bad mood and just bought 4 of those 40oz steel reserves. Drank them all in the time it took me to watch 2 movies.
Eventually I passed out being comfortable enough only to get awakened with the need to puke. But this time it was the usual fun yellow stuff. Absolute pure coffee grounds. Like a lot.

I love my wife and do not wish to pursue anything with woman X in this post. This is just a weird situation I‚Äôve found myself in and I want to see what other people think. There is no answer where I leave my wife to go to woman X.¬†



I grew up and had a tough life, lots of issues at home and a sister who needed additional support. My parents were both uninterested in raising us, i raised myself and had to raise my sister and support her through her deveolpemental issues. When I went to college I really distanced myself from my trauma and family and was very closed off. I met Woman X at university through at a coffee shop. We had instant connection that I had neve felt before; I realized they had a very similar life to me and had a lot of the answers I did not have to very similar issues I was facing. It was like we were kindred spirits and had basically the same childhood. They were 2 years older than me and had a better idea of what they wanted from life compared to me. Every single one of my experiences that I held dear to me had an answer from her, my passions were her passions, my interests were her interests, everything. I felt like it was a weird movie style relationship where we just immediately understood everything about each other.   
  
We were able to grow a lot together until there was a big issue with her family (very similar to what i was going through) and she had to leave the country because of it. In our final in person meeting she said she was afraid of falling in love with me, she was afraid that I was her soul mate and she was not ready for me. She asked me to wait for her and I did for years until I moved on years later and met the woman who helped me action the changes Woman X introduced to me. I went back and forth with Woman X but we had about 3-4 different missed connections until I gave up a few months before I met my now wife. My bond with my wife was not as strong but she helped me through so much in ways i cant imagine any one else able to carry so much for me. I will forever be loyal to her and forever work hard to give my wife the life she deserves.¬†



I ran into Woman X at a bank and started messaging her again. My wife knows who she is and is not bothered by it, she knows i‚Äôm loyal and im not telling her anything my wife doesnt already know. I just feel weird that all of these old feelings are coming back and I don‚Äôt really have a good channel to push them anywhere other than therapy. I feel like i‚Äôm living in a world where god tailormade a person for me and did not give either of us the ability to be with each other. Woman X is engaged and I‚Äôm married, i have no intention of ever leaving my wife but i‚Äôm having these weird feelings as if I deserve better than my wife when i definitely would not be able to get to where i am without her. I will never action these feelings but i also know its not good to bury them so i‚Äôm in a weird spot.

Her rotund husband lounged in the other room‚Äîsprawled out on his genuine leather, cup-holder armrest recliner‚Äîlazily watching Euphoria on his wall-mounted 80 inch Sony Bravia. He wasn‚Äôt sure what the whole show was about, but the girls were cute.

‚ÄúHENRY!‚Äù

He sighed. ‚ÄúGive it a rest, Mabel!‚Äù Back on the screen, Sydney Sweeney removed her bra.

Henry turned the volume up.

‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs just out there! Floating!‚Äù Mabel peeked through the blinds again.

Across the street, seventy feet up, the pitch-black silhouette of their next door Neighbor hovered, arms outstretched, casting an eerie relief against the thick dusk mist‚Äîan oppressive sky tainted with the amber glow of dying daylight.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a free country, Mabel!‚Äù Henry shouted over the moans of the television. ‚ÄúForget about it!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs too horrible!‚Äù She cried.

Henry cranked the volume higher.

As if hearing the old woman, the Neighbor cast his gaze downward. Mabel recoiled. His eyes burned with a pallid flame, and there in the flicker lay merciless visions‚Äîa cleansing, all-consuming conflagration.

A call to consume the world.

‚ÄúNo, NO!‚Äù Mabel groaned, her liver-spotted hands trembling. She found herself unable to pull away, incapable of pushing the intrusions from her mind‚Äîthe sight of bodies, endless bodies, twisting like burning reeds in the smokey Holocaust.

‚ÄúI SAID KNOCK IT OFF MABEL,‚Äù Henry screamed over the deafening cries of Sydney Sweeney‚Äôs Emmy-worthy climax. ‚ÄúIM TRYING TO WATCH TV!‚Äù

Mabel slumped to the floor, wheezing, her forehead beaded with sweat. Out in the thick mist, the silhouette had disappeared.

‚ÄúNOW I GOTTA REWIND ‚ÄòCAUSE I MISSED THE BEST PART.‚Äù Henry pounded the armrest. ‚ÄúWHY DONT YOU GET A DAMN HOBBY?‚Äù

As her breathing eased, Mabel‚Äôs gaze drifted from the blinds to the lighter on the coffee table. And when she picked it up, a calm tide swept through her. For the first time in her life, she knew exactly where to begin.

She never liked that recliner anyway. Œ©",1,1730836853.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I grew up in a small town in East Germany. *M√ºhlhausen in Thuringia* \- you can google that if you want. 

All my life, I only wanted one thing: to move away from there. There were no big sports clubs there, no city centre with cool clothes shops and so on. It just wasn't cool there. 

Everyone just wanted to do their job. My parents always said: ‚ÄòYou need a solid life.‚Äô 

That was true, as I realised over time, but I still moved away when I was 18.  

In 2012, I travelled to New York City ‚Äì for the first time in my life.    The world lay before me and nothing made me think of home ‚Äì that's what I thought at the time.

Then I stood there. On the Brooklyn Bridge. It was more of a coincidence that made me look at the brass plaque. And there I read the name John A. Roebling. 

*Roebling, Roebling, Roebling* ‚Äì that was the name of my school, I thought. 

I ran back to Manhattan as fast as I could and, without ordering a coffee, sat down in a corner of the Starbucks on Park Row - you had to know where you could get quick and cheap internet. 

And then I read it: Johann August R√∂bling (his German spelling) - born in M√ºhlhausen / Thuringia in 1806 - was the designer of the Brooklyn Bridge.

That's how small this damn world can be. Since then, I have walked across the bridge many times and have fondly remembered my home. ",3,1730836726.0,nycHistory,1,0.8,False

It‚Äôs a long one, so feel free to skip to the bottom for a quick summary.

So I went to law school with him for 3 years, and I swear the first day we met in our first year of school, he had some sort of dreamy look in his eyes that gave me vibes he was attracted to me. He mentioned something about grabbing coffee sometime, but I never followed up because I was in a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to give him the wrong idea because I thought he liked me.

Over the course of law school, we would see each other periodically, but we didn‚Äôt really have classes with each other until our third year. But every time I would see him, he still gave me dreamy eyes. He seemed to always make an effort to say hello to me and make conversation. Mind you, I almost never did this to him. He would reach out on LinkedIn to say happy birthday every year, and I never did the same. On LinkedIn, he even congratulated me on publishing my article on the Law Review, saying it was ‚Äúgood stuff.‚Äù Idk if that means he actually read it, but it was 80 pages and about a serious legal topic. Would he read it/compliment me on it if he didn‚Äôt like me? Maybe he‚Äôs really into reading legal articles.

This past year, our school had its annual ball where people dress up nicely, drink, and party to celebrate the end of the year. I looked great, lol. We ran into each other there, and he introduced me to his girlfriend. I could tell she didn‚Äôt seem happy to meet me. I was in this gorgeous, sparkly gown towering over her in heels, and she seemed like she was in flats and a plain gray jacket. I just felt like she was uncomfortable, which I did not intend to do, but I was all dressed up. I had also been drinking, so I was in a very social mood, and she seemed shy and quiet. All night, it seemed like he and she were just sitting on the side while everyone danced and partied, including me and my friends. I noticed he did look at me a few times, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think he felt bored with his girlfriend just sitting on the side and watching everyone. But I definitely felt his eyes on me.

In our third year of law school, he would sneak glances at me in the few classes we had together. In one class, my friends and I sat all the way in the middle-back of the classroom, and he sat in the front on the right side. My friend said she would catch him staring at me in that class, and it was very obvious because he had to turn his head to the back of the room in the opposite direction of where the professor was presenting. My friend thought he was staring at her but realized he wasn‚Äôt when she made eye contact with him, and his eyes didn‚Äôt meet hers but looked like he was looking at me next to her. I caught him looking at me in that class nearly every day.

One day after we had a brief yet friendly conversation the day before, he walked up to me and my friends before class and said something about accidentally leaving his textbook at his girlfriend‚Äôs house and being undecided if he should go to class without the book or just head home. Idk what he was trying to do by making that comment, but it sounded like he was intentionally trying to remind me he had a girlfriend. Mind you, we were only slightly friendly the day before, but maybe he felt bad about it so he wanted to draw a line in the sand? Well, after he did that I left him alone again because I didn‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable.

Well, we finally graduated this past May. He made sure to say happy birthday to me on LinkedIn this past September and made an effort to make small talk. I would just answer his questions and give concluding statements to end the convo (e.g., ‚ÄúThanks for wishing me happy birthday! Hope all is well.‚Äù) but he would keep it going (e.g., ‚ÄúSo where do you work? We should grab coffee or drinks sometime.‚Äù)

I guess I was feeling optimistic and curious, so after making small talk for a few weeks where we would only respond to each other once a week, I asked if he had an Instagram (IG) so we could continue our convos since I didn‚Äôt log on to LinkedIn very much. I did not check his response for like 10 days. But he responded that he was one of the few people in the world without an IG, but had a phone and gave me his number. After the long wait, I responded and gave him my number. He instantly texted me that same day!

So now we‚Äôve been texting long paragraphs for the past 3 weeks. Just getting to know each other: sharing stuff about our upbringings, favorite music, hobbies, hopes and dreams, etc. But he has given me compliments that the typical guy-friend probably wouldn‚Äôt (i.e., I‚Äôm very fashionable, I have great skin, he enjoys chatting with me). I know he doesn‚Äôt have social media, so I guess he has more time to text me. But we probably spend at least 1.5 hours, each, texting each other every day. We both work full time as lawyers, so our time is valuable. Have a feeling we could text even more, but I definitely try to space it out.

Well, we finally met up in person recently and I felt a bit nervous and awkward. I want to blame the coffee for being too strong, but guess I was a bit nervous around him. After all, we had been talking to each other a lot for the first time and had yet to meet in person. 

He texted me afterwards and sent me the music he mentioned from our coffee meet-up. He made sure to point out that he also met another girl from law school for lunch that day and that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs awesome.‚Äù (Side note: she‚Äôs actually kinda not awesome and selfish, so makes me question if he just makes friends with everyone). I feel like he was pointing that out to downplay our meet-up and to show that he meets up with a lot of friends, including other girls, so our meet-up wasn‚Äôt anything special. Maybe I‚Äôm reading too much into it, but it sounds like he was trying to drop a hint again like when he mentioned he left his book at his girlfriend‚Äôs house (per above).

I don‚Äôt know if he still has a girlfriend, but he‚Äôs so friendly and complimentary that it‚Äôs giving me a feeling that he likes me. He still wants to meet up again after I kind of tried to shut that option down by saying when work picks up, we‚Äôll be too busy. I playfully asked him what makes me so special that he wants to keep seeing me, and he ignored that question yet responded to my other comments. He does that often when I try to nail him down to see if he likes me.

TLDR; Why does he behave this way? Does he like me, or is he just a really nice guy who flirts inadvertently with everyone? Over our 3 years at school, I‚Äôve caught him staring at me many times, he goes out of his way to talk to me when I don‚Äôt do the same, and he constantly gives me compliments. Would a guy go through this much effort just to be friends with me? He could just be very friendly and not sure how else to make friends but to give compliments.",1,1730836607.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Started feeling it after every meal. Whenever I drank coffee. If I ate any amount of sugar. And of course, when using zyns. 

It got beteer after a month or two but not entirely. Never fully went away. Flated up again in April, and then again 6 months later. 

I went to a cardiologist, got tons of tests done. Nothing wrong with my heart. Went to a GE, got an endoscopy, they said there was some irritation in my esophagus. But I‚Äôve been put on two different acid reflux meds and they didn‚Äôt help.

I use 2 or 3 zyns every day. Have been for 4 years. Always the first on an empty stomach in the morning. I never thought that was enough to cause me any sort of health issue. I quit them to see if they were causing this discomfort. I lasted 10 days (thought maybe I felt a little better?) before giving up and going back on them. 

I need to quit them again for much longer and see. I‚Äôve seen some posts on this sub of nicotine pouches messing with your microbiome in your gut. I figure introducing zyn spit to my empty stomach every morning must be causing some issues. At least I hope that‚Äôs the case. I‚Äôm so tired of living with this problem. 

Weird thing is, actually using zyns only causes the symptom maybe, 20% of the time? Caffeine maybe 50%. And marijuana always makes it feel the worst. I quit marijuana for a month and it didn‚Äôt help.

I did not check his response for like 10 days. But he responded that he was one of the few people in the world without an IG, but had a phone and gave me his number. After the long wait, I responded and gave him my number. He instantly texted me that same day!

So now we‚Äôve been texting long paragraphs for the past 3 weeks. Just getting to know each other: sharing stuff about our upbringings, favorite music, hobbies, hopes and dreams, etc. But he has given me compliments that the typical guy-friend probably wouldn‚Äôt (i.e., I‚Äôm very fashionable, I have great skin, he enjoys chatting with me). I know he doesn‚Äôt have social media, so I guess he has more time to text me. But we probably spend at least 1.5 hours, each, texting each other every day. We both work full time as lawyers, so our time is valuable. Have a feeling we could text even more, but I definitely try to space it out.

Well, we finally met up in person recently and I felt a bit nervous and awkward. I want to blame the coffee for being too strong, but guess I was a bit nervous around him. After all, we had been talking to each other a lot for the first time and had yet to meet in person. 

He texted me afterwards and sent me the music he mentioned from our coffee meet-up. He made sure to point out that he also met another girl from law school for lunch that day and that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs awesome.‚Äù (Side note: she‚Äôs actually kinda not awesome and selfish, so makes me question if he just makes friends with everyone). I feel like he was pointing that out to downplay our meet-up and to show that he meets up with a lot of friends, including other girls, so our meet-up wasn‚Äôt anything special. Maybe I‚Äôm reading too much into it, but it sounds like he was trying to drop a hint again like when he mentioned he left his book at his girlfriend‚Äôs house (per above).

I don‚Äôt know if he still has a girlfriend, but he‚Äôs so friendly and complimentary that it‚Äôs giving me a feeling that he likes me. He still wants to meet up again after I kind of tried to shut that option down by saying when work picks up, we‚Äôll be too busy. I playfully asked him what makes me so special that he wants to keep seeing me, and he ignored that question yet responded to my other comments. He does that often when I try to nail him down to see if he likes me.

TLDR; Why does he behave this way? Does he like me, or is he just a really nice guy who flirts inadvertently with everyone? Over our 3 years at school, I‚Äôve caught him staring at me many times, he goes out of his way to talk to me when I don‚Äôt do the same, and he constantly gives me compliments. Would a guy go through this much effort just to be friends with me? He could just be very friendly and not sure how else to make friends but to give compliments.",1,1730836481.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Lethira stormed into Emperor Solvethir‚Äôs grand tent, her eyes blazing with barely contained fury. The emperor was reclining on plush cushions, his golden, intricately patterned robe draping over him like an aura of power and wealth. A gleaming diadem, set with a black fire opal and crowned by the sculpted wings of dragons, marked his head. He looked up mid-bite, a smug smile flickering across his lips as his piercing green-gold eyes settled on her.

‚ÄúAh, Lethira!‚Äù Solvethir greeted her, the mock warmth in his tone as thick as syrup. ‚ÄúCome, join us! The fruit is quite‚Ä¶ exquisite.‚Äù He gestured to the spread before him, seemingly unperturbed by her stormy entrance. 

She ignored his offer, hands clenched and voice bristling with anger. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you thinking, Solvethir? This invasion‚Äîhave you lost your mind?‚Äù

He paused, leisurely chewing before dabbing his lips with a silk cloth, an infuriating calm radiating from him. ‚ÄúSuch fervor. It‚Äôs as though you don‚Äôt remember that I predicted this very scene,‚Äù he drawled, his gaze slipping to his general and the priest beside him. ‚ÄúDid I not tell you she‚Äôd come, seething, to undermine me? Just as she did during the Wolfkin campaign.‚Äù

Lethira‚Äôs eyes narrowed, confusion flickering for a moment. ‚ÄúUndermine you? That was forty years ago. And I was against you because your idiotic orders slaughtered more people than the rebels ever could! None of those lives were worth the satisfaction of your ‚Äòvictory.‚Äô‚Äù

He only smiled, leaning back. ‚ÄúAnd yet we won, didn‚Äôt we? No empire ever survived by sparing the weak.‚Äù

Her fists clenched, a faint, angry hum of energy sparking around her fingers. ‚ÄúThis is different. This time, you‚Äôre sending us into a death trap, one you have no understanding of. I‚Äôve spent twenty years studying their world, not to sabotage you but to protect the empire.‚Äù

Solvethir snorted, dismissing her with a wave of his hand. ‚ÄúTwenty years wasted on parlor tricks. And you have the nerve to lecture me? Your judgment is hardly sound, given your choice to bring back a half-bread daughter, which is gross, and parade around in those strange, foreign clothes.‚Äù He sneered, his voice laced with disdain. ‚ÄúThis is about conquest‚Äîthe prophecy we‚Äôve awaited for centuries, the divine will we‚Äôre finally realizing.‚Äù

Lethira‚Äôs eyes widened slightly at his words. She knew, at that moment, that no amount of logic or reason would deter him. She took a long breath, suppressing her fury, and then spoke with a calm, cutting finality. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see your face when this all comes crashing down, Solvethir. Last Emperor,‚Äù she spat, the title laced with cold contempt.

His condescending smile faltered for the briefest instant, his glare narrowing as she turned on her heel, striding from the tent without a backward glance. Sparks continued to crackle at her knuckles as she stormed away, his glare hot on her back.

---

Lethira strode swiftly through the camp, her mind storming with anger and frustration. She could feel tears welling up, stinging her eyes, but she blinked them back, steeling herself as she reached her family‚Äôs tent. Taking a deep breath, she forced herself to calm, smoothing her expression before stepping inside.

She halted, surprised to see unexpected faces‚ÄîKreg, Garrick, Arana, Rayethra, Talas, and Eldaril. Alongside them stood Colonel Nalira, Velira, and Virionna, each wearing a serious expression. They exchanged tense glances as Lethira entered, a brief silence settling before Rayethra spoke.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you all doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here because we need a plan,‚Äù Rayethra said, as if it were obvious. ‚ÄúSomething to give us a chance to survive‚Ä¶ whatever damnation is coming our way.‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody is spying. Eldaril made sure of it,‚Äù said the fairy.

Lethira closed her eyes, letting out a bitter sigh. ‚ÄúThe empire is screwed no matter what. Solvethir‚Äôs arrogance is sending us to ruin.‚Äù

Kreg rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúWe know that. It‚Äôs about saving our own asses, our families, and our kin. Since you know their world best, we need your insight.‚Äù

A heavy silence settled over the room as Lethira looked around, her gaze meeting each of theirs.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she said at last, her voice steady but weary as she sat down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all ears, because my carefully laid-out plan is in fucking shambles.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps not entirely,‚Äù said Luridar, rubbing his chin. All eyes turned to him. ‚ÄúLethira, what can you tell us about their code of honor?‚Äù

‚ÄúTheir honor?‚Äù she replied, confused.

‚ÄúMainly their treatment of prisoners.‚Äù

She blinked, but before she could respond, Virionna spoke up, hand raised excitedly. ‚ÄúOh, I know this one! Lady Lethira gave me a book yesterday!‚Äù She opened the heavy tome she‚Äôd been holding and quickly flipped through the pages. ‚ÄúAh, yes! According to these ‚ÄòGeneva Conventions,‚Äô ‚ÄòPersons who have laid down their arms or who have been rendered incapable of fighting or who have been captured are to be regarded as hors de combat and shall not be attacked or killed. They shall be protected against violence to life and person, especially against murder, mutilation, cruel treatment, and torture.‚Äô Additionally, ‚ÄòPrisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated, including adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care.‚Äô‚Äù She finished with a proud smile.

Seeing everyone looking at her, she blushed. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ my family, the Willowsongs, we have the Gift of Letters. We can read a lot, very quickly,‚Äù she explained.

After a pause, Lathen spoke, ‚ÄúGrandfather, are you considering surrendering to the humans?‚Äù

Wide eyes turned back to Luridar. ‚ÄúPossibly. Since the emperor is sending us in regardless, we could use it as an opportunity to negotiate for ourselves.‚Äù

Lethira took a few moments to process his words.

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound very honorable,‚Äù Garrick said skeptically.

Unfazed, Luridar replied, ‚ÄúWe Sylvanor have been merchants and diplomats more than warriors. If they respect their code of honor, we could use this for great profit.‚Äù

Arana was the first to catch on. ‚ÄúOh, I see! Clever, old man.‚Äù She chuckled.

Talas spoke up, realizing as well. ‚ÄúI believe Lord Luridar‚Äôs idea is that, once the humans defeat the invading army, they may cross the Portal to retaliate. However, Lethira mentioned in her presentation‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHa! I thought you were listening!‚Äù 

‚Äú‚Äîthat this ‚ÄòNATO‚Äô alliance has only about 3.5 million soldiers, the same in reserve. Even with their powerful weapons, they don‚Äôt have the numbers to occupy a realm, let alone eight. They‚Äôd likely welcome allies here so they can focus their resources on those responsible for invading their lands.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly! There‚Äôs precedent for that, too, according to the book,‚Äù Virionna added.

Hope flickered in Lethira‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúBut how the hell will you convince them to spare us?‚Äù Lunira asked. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we also responsible for the invasion?‚Äù

The group fell silent, considering this obstacle.

Lethira finally spoke up, ‚ÄúTell them everything. Explain the prophecy, the realms, my mission, my plan for trade, the hardliners, and our idiotic emperor. If they understand what they‚Äôre up against, they‚Äôll be less fearful and angry and more inclined toward reason and profit.‚Äù She looked at her father and nephew. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs key.‚Äù

Luridar smiled reassuringly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôve handled plenty of lucrative negotiations.‚Äù

She returned his smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring the language books I‚Äôve written and give you a crash course.‚Äù

Rayethra nodded. ‚ÄúShadow Blades will do whatever we can to ensure Lord Luridar and Lord Lathen are taken alive.‚Äù

Lethira added, ‚ÄúMake sure they also receive the books during capture. I‚Äôve prepared a language book for the humans, too.‚Äù

Lathen looked confused. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it give us leverage if they relied on us to translate?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me, you don‚Äôt want that. There‚Äôll be thousands of prisoners, each needing medical care. You‚Äôd be worked to exhaustion. And if the Shadow Blades can‚Äôt infiltrate where they hold you, giving them a book improves your chances of communication.‚Äù

Arana ran her claws through her long hair. ‚ÄúWe should also try to minimize casualties on both sides.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but there are too many hardliners in command who‚Äôll make reckless choices,‚Äù Lethira said, frowning.

‚ÄúNothing a hammer to the head can‚Äôt fix,‚Äù Kreg quipped.

‚ÄúToo many heads, not enough hammers,‚Äù Nalira replied.

Rayethra agreed. ‚ÄúWe have only one battalion of Shadow Blades and about two hundred thousand officers and nobles in the army. We‚Äôre skilled, but not *that* skilled.‚Äù

Ghorak spoke up, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be a Shadow Blade to eliminate an officer. We could recruit others who understand the stakes.‚Äù

Lemiora chimed in, ‚ÄúThe invasion starts tomorrow. How the hell will you get enough people on board without being caught?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt reach everyone,‚Äù Lethira replied. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do what we can. It‚Äôll still be a bloodbath, but we might save some lives.‚Äù

Rayethra stood, signaling resolve. ‚ÄúShadow Blades, you know your assignment. I‚Äôll relay my orders to the battalion.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Commander!‚Äù they replied in unison.

Lethira rose. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring the language books and teach my father and nephew as much German as possible today.‚Äù

Garrick asked, ‚ÄúYou all can really learn a language in a day?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt normally takes a week or two,‚Äù Lathen explained, ‚Äúbut in desperate times, we can get a lot done in a day.‚Äù

‚ÄúBlade Master Lethira, are you joining the invasion?‚Äù Velira asked.

‚ÄúNo. I wasn‚Äôt given orders. I‚Äôll be taking Lina home, far from the mess that‚Äôs about to unfold.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps you could take your mother, sister, and niece, too,‚Äù Luridar suggested.

‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre willing, there‚Äôs space. It‚Äôll take two or three weeks by road.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI still need to help open the portal,‚Äù Lunira said, ‚Äúbut if you take the stone road, I can catch up on wyvern.‚Äù

Lethira nodded. ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs settled.‚Äù

Rayethra stood. ‚ÄúAlright, we all know our tasks. Let‚Äôs move out.‚Äù

‚Äú*Yes, Commander!*‚Äù replied the Shadow Blades, as everyone prepared to face the days ahead.

‚Äî

As dawn painted the sky in muted colors, the Sylvanor family gathered around the Rivian, preparing for the departure. The electric vehicle stood silently, towing the RV behind it, its only sound the soft chirping as it unlocked. Lethira took a deep breath, steadying herself as she looked at the loved ones she was leaving behind.

They came together for a final, tearful group hug. Lina, clutching her mother‚Äôs hand, glanced up at Lathen. She wrapped her arms around his waist, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll come back, right?‚Äù

Lathen knelt down, giving her a reassuring smile. ‚ÄúOf course, Lina. I‚Äôll come back and tell you all about it. I‚Äôll even show you how much German I learned, okay?‚Äù He ruffled her hair gently, bringing out a faint smile from her as she nodded, trying to hold back tears.

Nearby, Lunira stood with her brother, Lathen, and wrapped her arms around his shoulders. She didn‚Äôt need to say much. ‚ÄúStay safe,‚Äù she whispered, her voice tight. 

Lathen squeezed her in return. ‚ÄúWe both will.‚Äù

Lemiora placed a soft hand on Lathen‚Äôs cheek, her eyes glistening as she tried to memorize every detail of his face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always made us proud, my son,‚Äù she murmured, her voice thick with emotion. Lathen pressed his cheek against her hand, giving her a small, grateful smile.

Off to the side, Luridar and Liriana shared a quiet embrace. She held onto him tightly, whispering a promise to herself that he would come back safely. He kissed her forehead, reassuring her in a low voice, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be together again. I promise.‚Äù

Finally, Lethira turned to Ghorak, who stood beside her, his towering form both imposing and gentle in that moment. They exchanged a silent nod of mutual respect, Lethira‚Äôs gaze filled with gratitude. ‚ÄúKeep safe, big guy,‚Äù she said softly.

The last farewells lingered as Lethira helped Lina, Lemiora, and Liriana into the Rivian. As the family watched, Lethira turned back for a final look, her heart heavy. 

The Rivian slipped away quietly, its departure carrying the unspoken promises and hopes of everyone it left behind.

‚Äî

The army was assembled in massive, ordered ranks, positioned roughly 800 paces south of the portal and facing north. Split into two sections, one to the east and the other to the west, each division held a million soldiers with a 250 paces gap between them. In that space loomed three dragons and seven colossal behemoths.

At the forefront stood Lord Zarageth, a menacing black dragon with scales that shimmered like onyx. Beside him was Lady Seraphara, a blue dragon whose sapphire-hued scales glinted in the early light, and Lord Morvagor, a dark red dragon with crimson, nearly ember-like scales. These dragons, ancient and fearsome, seemed to be holding their immense strength in anticipation. Flanking them were the behemoths‚Äîmassive creatures, towering at around 110 paces, with scaly hides that matched the dragons‚Äô. Their bull-like forms were armored, and each one bore wooden fortresses on their backs, packed with orcish archers. Their handlers sat atop, maintaining a watchful grip on their reins.

In the vanguard stood the cavalry: 200,000 mounted soldiers, ready and waiting. Right behind them on the Western side were the Sylvanor family‚Äôs troops, that included six elven legions, each five thousand strong, a regiment of a thousand cavalry, and an orcish company of four hundred.

Leading the Sylvanor cavalry was Luridar, positioned firmly at the front. Mounted on his warhorse, he surveyed the ranks with a calm, resolute gaze. Further back, Lathen and Ghorak sat astride their own horses, each commanding their respective forces. Lathen, wearing his Colonel‚Äôs insignia, commanded one of the six elven legions. Beside him, Ghorak, broad and imposing, directed all Sylvanor infantry with a quiet intensity, his seasoned eyes scanning the formations.

The two wore armor, plated and reinforced, with cloth overlays bearing the Sylvanor family‚Äôs insignia‚Äîa silver mockingbird poised atop a poppy flower. They sat silently, awaiting Solvethir‚Äôs address, palms sweating, understanding the gravity of what lay before them.

‚Äî

Solvethir stood tall on a grand, gilded chariot, a symbol of imperial authority, with two key figures by his side‚Äîthe High Imperial Priest, **Elandor Valis**, and the Campaign Commander, **General Corinth Alvarian**. The army, stretching far beyond sight, awaited in silence, as the High Priest, Elandor, handed Solvethir a talisman‚Äîa small, intricately carved amulet of silver and obsidian. The talisman glowed faintly as he grasped it, amplifying his voice to carry across the vast formation.

With a steady, commanding gaze, Solvethir began, his voice imbued with the solemnity of the occasion.

‚ÄúSoldiers of the Empire, you gather here not merely as soldiers but as symbols of our people‚Äôs strength and purpose. Today, you march with the weight of our ancestors upon your shoulders, bound to a destiny that has been laid by prophecy a thousand years ago!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis moment demands sacrifice, loyalty, and valor‚Äîqualities that you all have shown in bearing the Empire‚Äôs banner. Our unity binds us stronger than any steel, a unity forged by faith, strength, and a resolve to bring peace and prosperity to all realms. We do not embark on this journey lightly. Our hearts are with every soul, every family, every life‚Äù

‚ÄúWe stand today in the face of glory, and we do so as an Empire that has withstood countless trials. Beyond this portal lies a path to destiny, a chance to expand the reach of our legacy, to bring our light into the last realm that has yet to know it. Remember your purpose, and know that whatever lies ahead, you carry the honor of our Empire with every step.

‚ÄúFight with courage. Stand together. Victory is the Empire‚Äôs birthright!‚Äù

He raised his hand, and a resounding cheer erupted across the ranks, as the army braced itself for the march forward.

‚Äî

A thousand Mages surrounded the platform on the eastern, southern and western sides.

Lunira knelt among the mages on the southern side of the platform, hands gripping the cool, dense edge of black stone carved with intricate designs that coiled like roots across its polished surface. A woman‚Äôs hand rested heavily on her left shoulder, and‚Äîunfortunately‚Äîa man‚Äôs on her right. She grimaced. As always, she cursed internally at the need for contact with one.  

Lunira‚Äôs fingers clenched the stone platform's edge, its intricate carvings pressing into her skin, grounding her. She bit back a groan as a massive pulse of ether flowed through her‚Äîan intense, hot pressure forcing its way from the mages behind her, through her arms, and into the stone. She gritted her teeth as the sharp scent of magic crackled in the air. Across from her, the platform‚Äôs western and eastern edges glowed with an unearthly light, creeping toward the center like veins of molten gold.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she hissed under her breath. Her arms were on fire, her muscles taut against the flood of energy. 

‚ÄúHold steady!‚Äù The mage to her left‚Äîa dark-haired elf, a woman with an iron grip‚Äîcalled over the rising hum of power. ‚ÄúAlmost there!‚Äù

Lunira only gave a curt nod, her voice caught somewhere between a growl and a gasp. The pressure grew heavier with each heartbeat, the glow now just paces away from the center of the platform. She barely noticed the male mage gripping her right shoulder. Disgust and resentment flickered in her thoughts, but the blinding pain kept her grounded.

‚ÄúDamn it, hurry up!‚Äù she muttered, as if sheer will could force the magic faster. The carvings sparked and shimmered, now a hair‚Äôs breadth from meeting at the center.

And then‚ÄîBOOM.

A massive shockwave erupted, blasting them all back. Lunira‚Äôs vision exploded into white and then faded to black spots. She hit the ground hard, the ringing in her ears muffling the shouts and groans around her. Her arms screamed in agony, but all she could do was lie there, gasping, her mind a fractured mess of pain and frustration.

‚ÄúAnyone dead?‚Äù a distant voice echoed over the ringing in her ears.

Lunira forced herself up on one elbow, her limbs shaky, muscles burning as if they‚Äôd been set alight. She coughed, her voice hoarse. ‚ÄúBarely.‚Äù

A female mage‚Äôs hand appeared in front of her. Lunira looked up, grateful to find the elf woman who‚Äôd been on her left. She grabbed her hand and staggered to her feet, managing a dry smile through the haze of pain. ‚ÄúRemind me not to volunteer for the front line next time.‚Äù

The woman chuckled, giving Lunira‚Äôs hand a firm squeeze before releasing it. ‚ÄúSure. Let's call it ‚Äòvolunteer'‚Äù

Nearby, the shimmering colors of the newly opened portal towered over the field, a massive, square archway of light casting eerie reflections over the soldiers waiting beyond. Lunira glanced back at it as they limped away, the sight filling her with a strange sense of both awe and dread.

She grimaced, muttering a bitter curse under her breath. ‚ÄúMay the gods spare us from the clusterfuck that's about to happen.‚Äù

The faint tremor beneath Lathen‚Äôs boots grew into a steady rumble as the mages cleared the path to the portal. He watched as the dragons shifted restlessly in the field's open center, each massive form casting shadows over the assembled ranks of soldiers. The portal, an otherworldly shimmer of color, loomed ahead, both a gateway and a threshold between worlds.

Lord Zarageth, the largest of the three dragons, lifted his head and bared his teeth, smoke curling from his nostrils as he stared into the portal, his impatience plain. With an earth-shaking snort, he leaped forward, wings unfurling to their full, glorious span as he launched himself toward the gateway, his massive tail sweeping over the ground as he passed.

‚ÄúZarageth,‚Äù Lathen muttered, a hint of admiration mixing with wariness. No one could deny the power in that creature‚Äôs eagerness.

Beside him, Lady Seraphara rolled her eyes, letting out a low rumbling huff as she watched Zarageth disappear into the portal. Her gaze lingered for just a heartbeat, as if assessing her own reluctance to follow such impetuousness. But with a flick of her tail, she took off gracefully, gliding toward the portal with far more dignity than Zarageth had shown. Finally, Lord Morvagor, his scales a deep, dark red, lowered his head as if in solemn farewell to the army before him and stepped through with a slow, calculated stride.

Lathen‚Äôs gaze shifted to the sky as a whoosh of wings sounded above. From the rear, the sky darkened under the shadow of twenty thousand wyverns, their riders mounted with a calculated ease, faces set in grim determination. The wyverns dipped low, their wings beating in unison as they descended towards the portal, falling into expert formation as they swooped over the waiting soldiers.

""Onward!‚Äù The command rang out, snapping Lathen from his trance. The line shifted, and he felt the weight of the march settle over him as the troops began moving. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for what lay on the other side.

Beside him, a soldier leaned close, an embedded Shadow Blade with eyes sharp and alert. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see you through this, Colonel,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúOur orders are clear: you make it out alive.‚Äù

Lathen offered a grateful nod. ""I‚Äôll hold you to that.""

The air shifted, and a familiar, almost eerie presence sidled up to him. Eldaril, a smirk stretched across her face, fixed Lathen with a stare that seemed to see right through him. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt get too cozy, handsome. No one‚Äôs immune to a horrible death, not even you.‚Äù

Lathen forced a laugh, though unease prickled down his spine. ‚ÄúThanks for the‚Ä¶ reassurance, Eldaril.‚Äù

Eldaril‚Äôs smirk deepened, her tone as dry as desert sands. ‚ÄúAnytime, Colonel. Anytime.‚Äù

They marched forward, the portal ahead widening to meet them.

1gkfkc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Write_Right/comments/1gkfkc2/the_brutalist_hotel/,The Brutalist Hotel,"I don‚Äôt believe the brutalist hotel still functions. I think it once did. I get that feeling from the yellowed plaster, and the brown stains on the ceiling tiles tell me a lot of smoking once took place here. The coffee-colored linoleum in the dormitory wing is pockmarked with ancient cigarette burns as well.

The brutalist hotel lies near the north end of the dream version of the city where I live. I first found myself there via the lurches in time and geography that always thwart my travels in my dreams. As usual, I was headed for a bar. There are several bars in the dream version of the city where I live that are dear to me. Rarely do my dreams allow me to get there, and, even when they do, I‚Äôm rarely permitted more than a glance through the door. Otherwise, I guess I wouldn‚Äôt know they exist at all.

In this instance, I was headed to a bar just north of the train station in the dream version of the city where I live. I had lucked out in finding my way out of the train station and I was frantically making my way there. My pace is always frantic in my dreams. This particular bar is not my favorite, but it has a second-stringer charm that one sometimes desires.

The train station is a terrible place. It contains an impossibly long row of menacing brass turnstiles that are automated by some inscrutable machinery. They click and turn of their own accord. Above each turnstile is a mechanical display, with rustling numerals that constantly change according to no logical pattern I can discern. The tumbling numbers sound like shuffling cards and angry hornets.

I hate the train station. The people there are blurry phantoms, and very unhelpful. They take pleasure in being unhelpful. They want you to be confused. Unlike the bars, my dreams always permit me to spend lots of time in the train station.

The people in the bars have definition. Their faces are clear and tangible, with deep lines and creases. The bars are working-class, and the patrons are mostly male. They rarely smile but they are kind. They are drunks. They sip shots with their beers and smoke endlessly. They are not phantoms. If I needed help, they would help me, if my dreams ever allowed me to talk to them. They cuss good-naturedly at each other and tell the kinds of jokes that are banal but make one feel secure.

When I say the brutalist hotel no longer functions, I do not mean it is uninhabited. I have come across at least four tangible inhabitants, as well as plenty of phantoms that whisper and gibber and generally do nobody any harm, though I am not sure that they do not intend harm. What unnerves me the most about the brutalist hotel is the fact that it looks like it once contained multitudes. There used to be company there, and now there isn‚Äôt.

The lobby of the brutalist hotel is nearly the size of a modest hockey stadium. A tiny cubicle right by the door contains the first tangible inhabitant I have met: the watchman. He is bald, somewhere between sixty and seventy years of age. He wears hornrimmed glasses with thick lenses. He is surly and smells like cabbage, because he cooks sauerkraut and potatoes in a small, cheap aluminum pot on a hotplate which sits on a tiny shelf behind him. Above the hotplate is a Stihl calendar from 1987, featuring jaundiced nude women with perms and garter belts. I like the guy, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to like anyone. Sometimes he challenges me with gibberish questions. Sometimes he just glances up at me with mild disgust. He watches old sitcoms, dubbed into Czech or German, on a portable TV. I can‚Äôt see the tiny black and white screen, but I always get the feeling it‚Äôs something like Step by Step or Perfect Strangers. The laugh track does not make him smile.

I saw him smile once, though. One awful night I found a screeching, dying chicken in a dim corner of the stadium-sized lobby, on the dirty tile floor near a tatty old sofa and a stale, aluminum standing ashtray. It lay on its side. I tried in vain to pick it up, but it continued screeching as it turned ash-gray and my fingers penetrated its body. Its body crumbled sickeningly under my touch.

I looked across the vast expanse of the lobby and cried to the watchman for help. He sighed and came out of his cubicle. I saw he was wearing shorts and rubber sandals over bare feet. As he came over in imperious strides, I stood up, the ashy matter of the chicken coating my fingers, and pointed to the mess on the floor. I tried to make myself understood, but I didn‚Äôt speak his language. He looked at the chicken and laughed in an almost lascivious way. He grinned and elbowed me in the ribs, making remarks in some dialect that seemed halfway between Slovak and Polish. It was obvious by the nudging and the leering that the remarks were unseemly.

The stairwells are the worst part of the brutalist hotel. Sometimes the stairs take you to the next floor up. Sometimes they take you back to the lobby, in which case the brutalist hotel is nothing more than an infinite stack of lobbies. That is so hateful. Sometimes they take you someplace else. Once, they took me to a large, dark cabin in a logging camp in winter, where my dead uncle threatened me with a revolver because he thought I was a Nazi. That was a long night. Many times they have taken me to the train station.

The stairwells themselves are almost totally dark. They contain most of the brutalist hotel‚Äôs phantoms. I also once met an old woman in a headscarf on one of the landings. The landings are as large as most people‚Äôs bedrooms. She was standing behind a folding table in the near darkness, selling a pitiful assortment of fruits and vegetables. She was nice to me. She chatted amiably about the quality of her produce, but it was all sad, mushy, and wrinkled. I fished a few cents from my pocket and bought a pear. Later, as I progressed up a flight of stairs, I accidentally dropped it. It rolled down the stairs and became lost in the darkness. I worried about that. I didn‚Äôt want her to find it and think that I had considered her pear not good enough. Not that I had had any intention of eating it: I just didn‚Äôt want her feelings to be hurt. My dreams often consist of my trying hard not to hurt or disappoint other people.

On one of the middle floors of the brutalist hotel is an open conference room. It has two sets of double doors that are always propped open. It‚Äôs actually not very large. It‚Äôs always dark in there. I don‚Äôt know if the lights work or not. I‚Äôve never tried to turn them on. The floor is orange linoleum. The walls are white stucco, with a swath of beige around the bottom four feet. It is furnished with square particle board tables and straight back chairs.

The windows in the conference room are so hateful. I know, intellectually, that if I look out of them I will see nothing but a dark street, and a sidewalk lit by dim, yellow streetlights. Yet I dread those windows. They will show me the faces I see in the bathroom tiles, the faces the trees make through the thin fabric of my bedroom curtains during the morning of the hangover, the faces that dwell behind my eyelids during the night of the hangover.

On an upper floor of the brutalist hotel, behind an unmarked door, is a log cabin. I know. I‚Äôve seen it. I was lucky enough to get there once. My dreams let their guard down. Now, they try to convince me I was mistaken, but I know that‚Äôs a lie. I‚Äôve been there. I‚Äôm not foolish enough to think I‚Äôll ever get back there, but my dreams will never convince me it was an illusion.

My Aunt Fay was in that cabin. She was just getting ready to go on a trip to Natural Bridge when I came bounding in. She said my name in surprise and laughed, as was her way in life. There was a creek rock fireplace with a roaring fire and an old gas range nearby. She heated up a can of Chef Boyardee Roller Coasters with meatballs in a battered old tin pan for me. Then my hateful dreams propelled me back to waking life. It didn‚Äôt take my dreams long to realize their error--but, still, they slipped up.

I think it‚Äôs on the same floor--maybe one above, maybe one below--where the dormitory wing is. It lies behind heavy steel double doors with frosted glass. It reeks of stale cigarette smoke, but no one is there anymore. The doors of the rooms are heavily padded and covered in maroon vinyl, studded with rivets, as if they were government offices. But they‚Äôre not: they‚Äôre dorms. I know because I once forced my way into one.

My dreams had played with my feelings one too many times. Every few months or so I get strength in my dreams. Despite the slow, underwater movements that confront almost everyone in these fearful situations, now and then we can power through, through our sheer frustration. I forced a padded door open and was confronted by a small entrance hall. To my left was a bathroom and a separate WC. In front of me and to my right were doors leading to the two bedrooms.

Moonlight shone through the frosted glass in the door in front of me, so that‚Äôs where I went. I opened the door and the cold moonlight spilled onto the coffee-colored linoleum. One twin bed was stripped and empty. The other contained a desiccated corpse wrapped in a heavy duvet.

The corpse raised its head and roared at me. I fled the room in terror.

I recount these episodes because they are a break from monotony. In reality, this is what the brutalist hotel means: monotony. Usually I see no more than the lobby, or the awful stairwell. I would actually like to explore the brutalist hotel more, but my hateful dreams rarely permit it. Still, I have deduced, through the mysterious omniscience that often accompanies one in dreams, that somewhere in this hotel there is a restaurant, and even a bar. I believe they are usually empty, but I have a slim hope that sometimes they are not.

I believe that everyone from my life--past, present, and future--is in the brutalist hotel, but it is so vast, I do not believe I shall ever find even one of them, apart from my Aunt Fay. The dreams really let themselves down with that one. Our dreams exist to make us miserable, of that I am convinced, and they will not let that brief, stolen beauty slide. That is why I fear death. I know, when the time comes, my dreams will carry me into the conference room, and force me to look out the dreaded windows, and wait to see whatever deferred horror I shall see.

I will wait for the faces, the whispers, the shadow at the foot of my bed, the dead classmate weeping in the armchair, and it will remain, forever, in the hallway, just out of sight.",1,1730836255.0,Write_Right,0,1.0,False

Hi folks,

Looking at the idea of upgrading my setup and wondering what is/are the best option/s.

My current setup:

Rancilio Silvia w/ Auber Instruments PiD w/ pre-infusion installed. Niche Zero

Adding the PiD was HUGE and has helped tremendously in getting better more consistent coffee from the Silvia. The work flow is decent, and the coffee has been generally good.

In all honesty, part pf this upgrade question is really what am I going to get by upgrading.

The idea of moving on from the single boiler is nice. While I don't frequently make lots of drinks at once, it happens on occasion and being able to potentially produce drinks faster would be nice.

My current routine:

I'm pulling 1-2 shots per day every day of the week. Generally when the weather starts to get colder in Canada I'm steaming milk once or twice per day, but almost never through the summer.

I've had my eyes on the La Marzocco Linea Micra more and more, but I'm not sure whether to be continuing to save to move further up to the Mini, or if that's necessary. While I think the Decent machines appear to have tons of customization and incredible features in that regard, I'm not currently, and don't see myself becoming the type of person who's fiddling with settings all the time.

I'm looking for consistently good coffee that's easy enough to produce. I'm not saying automatic machine level easy, I enjoy the process of grinding and pulling shots with some experimentation, but I'm not experimenting every day.

I don't have a particular budget in mind at the moment and more than anything I'm trying to get an idea of what I should be budgeting for to move towards more of an endgame setup.

Lastly, is the Niche Zero a sufficient grinder? Or is there something more if I'm upgrading the espresso machine too? I'm usually only using the Niche for espresso. I used to switch between espresso and Filter on it, but tend to just use my Commandante C40 MK3 for filter so that both grinders can be preset where I need them. I did see the Lagom P64 grinder recently and that thing is beautiful. Maybe entirely unnecessary, but beautiful.

Thank you for any input and ideas!",1,1730836132.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Can I get any advice on how to proceed ?","My gf had to take some medication this morning at exactly 9am(sorry can‚Äôt say what med it is). We both know she‚Äôs going to hurt for a while after taking this med and I know I have to be there for here. We usually meet up at her place on Tuesdays bcos she has online classes @2:30p and I usually don‚Äôt come over till around 1:30p. I knew I had to be here so I make plans to be here for her. I don‚Äôt tell her I‚Äôm coming so early cos I wanted it to be a surprise and was hoping it would make her feel better and we can talk and hang around and power through the pain. If it‚Äôs unbearable we can just lay down together and I‚Äôll be there for her. 

I wake up @8:30(would have been up earlier to go to her place but I have to drop my brother up at work and she knows I usually do this) and check in on her asking how she‚Äôs feeling and she only responds with a thumbs up and nothing more. I leave the house at 8:45am, drive 10mins and drop my brother off at work, drive 45mins to her favorite coffee place , wait in line and get her favorite coffee and breakfast sandwich. Drive15 mins to her place but stop at a nearby gas station to buy her gummy bears,chips and chocolate that she likes before heading over. I call her and tell her that I‚Äôm outside but she only responds with an ok and hangs up. While trying to get  everything that I bought she comes down and opens the door before going back upstairs(she‚Äôs never done this before. She usually opens the door and we hug, kiss or both).

I go up to the living room and wait there bcos I think she‚Äôs in the restroom(I can see the light on in there). After a while I go check on her but she‚Äôs not in there. I go check her room and see her laying in bed. I try to talk to her but she gives me short answers and obviously doesn‚Äôt want to talk. So I just kneel on the floor beside her, try to caress her and tell her that I‚Äôm her if she wants to talk. I stay like that for like 5mins but I get uncomfortable bcos the floor is hard wood so you know my knees nd toes hurt. Shes close to the edge of the bed so I try to lay beside her with one leg supporting me hoping she would create some space so we can just cuddle and let her know I‚Äôm there but she doesn‚Äôt budge and after being in the awkward position for like 2mins and my one leg abt to give out, I move and just sit on the floor and place my left hand on her lap and just stroke her. I know she‚Äôs feeling the hurt bcos of the medicine bcos she will occasionally moan and sniffle and I will say I‚Äôm sorry bcos I hate that she‚Äôs feeling like this. After a while she just tell me I disappointed her this morning and goes quiet. I try to ask her what I did without trying coming off in any bad tone. She then says I knew she had to take the med at 9 AM but didn‚Äôt show any signs of caring when all I did last night was text her and check in on her and the first thing I did when I woke up was to check in on her. She then says she thought I would have been here earlier to be with her and I know I could have done better but I  still had to drive my brother to work and she knows I do this often.

I still feel bad and tired often. I think it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm eating. The amount of times I wake up ready to conquer the day, only for my breakfast to mess with my stomach, leading me to rest on the couch for an hour or two is upsetting. 

Today I ate day old white rice, 2 eggs and red onion with chili oil. And im currently on the couch resting cuz I feel bad, esp cuz I have things I need to get done today. Other days I‚Äôve had hot oatmeal with PB and berries, and have recently started doing overnight oats with berries, whey protein, soy milk, Greek yogurt and this has really messed with my stomach.

I‚Äôm not sure where to even start with this. I work at a restaurant and have a tiny apartment so generally eat out a lot but I‚Äôve been trying to meal prep (thus the overnight oats). I also can‚Äôt not eat. I can go a couple hours without breakfast but then I get really cranky and feel like my blood sugar gets too low. 

I don‚Äôt drink cow milk, but eat yogurt, whey protein, etc‚Ä¶which tbh doesn‚Äôt feel great but I can‚Äôt hit my protein goals without it. I know for example that if I eat ice cream, my stomach will hurt a few hours later, but if I eat vegan ice cream I‚Äôm fine.

Complaining to me about pretty much nothing, while doing shit himself.(Doesnt help at home, comes home drunk and wakes everybody in the middle of the night, doesnt contribute to food though eating from ours...). A month ago it escalated and he said he wants to go. Great, please go! He did nothing. A week a go, we got as well in a fight, where i aswell told him to just pack up and go. Again nothing. Oh well, he did piss in our garden in front of the livingroom window at night. Two nights later he pissed on the balcony in front of his room, dripping down getting R1 shoes full (who just had his coffee and a cig before going to work at 4.30 am).
The letter that he HAS to pack is on the way. 
Today I cane home from Uni and R1 showed me a picture of bloody toilet paper in the toilet. I am livid! I can't wait the day he moves out. Though the best would be, if he moves out tomorrow! It's gross, it's disgusting. The atmosphere is tense.
The police can't do anything unless there is violence etc.

1gkf1d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gkf1d5/135_days/,135 Days,"Four Months:


Last night I cried and cried about my ex, the last big mistake on alcohol. I ruined that relationship and any sort of semblance after because of the way I was. The way I treated her.

Something just triggered last night. I wept on a walk at 1130pm. Then ate ice cream and fell asleep.

I woke up sad. I‚Äôm still sad. I just want to show them that I am capable of getting better. Earn their forgiveness. Say apologies that are more for me than them. Feeling locked in a cycle of this routine of unbearable heartbreak and overwhelming grief. 

Then I realize that I‚Äôm not hungover. That I have coffee to make. That I have a cat to feed. That my bed needs made. I have writing to get to (I work in writing). I have a workout that needs done. I have to plan my meals. Journal. Walk. Get sunlight. Plan a trip. Brush my teeth. Play with my cat. Laugh at comedy. Write more comedy. Cry a little bit more. Have some me time. Watch a new movie or laugh at the next episode of 7th Heaven on your one and only watch through. Then journal again at the end of the night. Think of them, your ex. Think of your dad who died last year. Feel it all. Reflect. Breathe. Turn off the light.

Then get up because you always get comfortable when you forget to brush your teeth.

Life is still hard when you‚Äôre sober. It does not stop. And drinking stops you in your tracks when the rest of the world moves on, and now it‚Äôs on us to play catchup.

At least being sober feels like I can keep up.",6,1730834912.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

TL;DR  - I take 170mg of IR a day‚Ä¶yep, read that right‚Ä¶ AND I feel damn near like I did when the amazingly scientific method of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs test you on 5mg a day for 10 days and see what happens‚Äù was administered after I was diagnosed in Summer of 2022. I am a 42M, USA, 6ft & 260lbs. 

I eventually found incredible results in Vyvanse right before Xmas in ‚Äò22 with a 70mg dose around 7am and a 60mg dose at 2pm. I slept like an angel from 11-6:30, I had energy and optimism, I encouraged family members to seek testing because it turns out maybe we weren‚Äôt just kids stuffed into gifted & talented who turned out to be sincerely intelligent yet fall so short of success it isn‚Äôt funny misbehaving little shits‚Ä¶ and yeah, sibling diagnosed as well and Vyvanse was ü§å. I noticed efficacy degradation in early ‚Äò23 right alongside shortage and exclusive patent expiration. Naturally I chalked it up to a conspiracy theory and could see the writing on the wall for ‚Äúpill shopping‚Äù pharmacies, finding 6-7 day supplies of mixed chewable doses, doubled up smaller mg‚Äôs, and commonly unfulfilled IOU‚Äôs from pharmacies‚Ä¶ It got so bad and vulnerably speaking - punched me in the abundantly funded mental bank account of hope and psychologically safety‚Ä¶ dripping with sarcasm.

Fast fwd I have had 6 different generic IR manufacturers, shapes, colors, and side effects - most enjoyably being the production of what I can only describe as wallpaper glue I am constantly trying to expel from my esophageal region so I can you know‚Ä¶ just attempt to FUCKING breathe and talk‚Ä¶ I hate my life.

YES, something has changed. Yes, this AINT (insert life-saving stimulant). And yes, if you live in the good old US of A, I am certain you are equally as thrilled at the incredibly horrifying prospect that after tonight, RFK could just do us all a big favor and really fuck shit up‚Ä¶

I hate weed. Coffee makes the aforementioned glue mutate into welding material. Alcohol is a triple edged sword. And well‚Ä¶when masturbation‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs fun you‚Äôre fucking lazy!

And if not is there any way I can beat harder levels than those without fps bypass (because going above 60fps on a you60hz monitor causes screen tearing).

1gkewzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OGPBackroom/comments/1gkewzn/ethics_concern_coach_committing_huge_fraud_and/,Ethics concern? Coach committing huge fraud and pulling associates: [Long rant],"First things first, it‚Äôs important to say I work in OGP just to get it out of the way. 

My coach is a chronic liar, I‚Äôve only worked at this store for a month (Walmart in total for 5 years) and the amount of lying she commits makes me believe that this is second nature to her. 

For example, on my weekend she decides to text me asking if I can come in to help. I say no, it‚Äôs my weekend, which she replies ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs Event 1‚Äù (this was like early October). My TL texts me asking when I‚Äôm coming in, which I say I‚Äôm not, and she replies ‚ÄúBut [Coach] said you agreed to come in.‚Äù I send her a screenshot of our texts and ask her to circle where I said that. I was left alone for the rest of the day. 

A few more examples but that‚Äôs a good standard for what we‚Äôre facing here. Onto the  main reason I write this post. 

My department has a huge metric fraud problem. I learned that there‚Äôs this thing called ‚Äúghost picking‚Äù. Essentially to boost metrics, FTPR (first time pick rate) and OTPR (on time pick rate), it has been encouraged to print vizpick labels of the items you‚Äôre missing, scan the vizpick label and then the OSN label on the tote to show that it was ‚Äúpicked‚Äù, and then that shopper goes in the backroom and hopefully finds it. If not, they go on the floor and pick something similar. 

3 times this week, myself alone have found that customers are very confused as to why on their receipt on the Walmart app they‚Äôre receiving two boxes of K-cups instead of their four bags of instant coffee. Or that it says we picked honey ham but there is no honey ham to be seen in their tote. 

It doesn‚Äôt say substituted, unavailable, or it was being delivered to their house, it says it was picked and it was because of this ghost picking. After confronting my coach about it, she says she doesn‚Äôt know anything about ghost picking‚Ä¶ which solves nothing. 

A good coach would be furious that their job is in jeopardy, have an immediate huddle and put a stop to it. Knowing her track record, I can only assume she‚Äôs the one that started encouraging it. 

_____

Slightly off track but I wanted to mention a few things about my fellow associates:

This last week a key host from HBA (we‚Äôll call her R) has been helping with surveys. Our SM had offered this to her to expand a little and help with our metrics. All R does is talk to customers when we dispense an order, give them a piece of candy, and ask if they can give us five stars. Pretty harmless. 

I have been giving her advice on how things are supposed to work, because this is her first month at Walmart period. She knows how toxic our backroom is and how nasty a woman my coach and TL can be. 

My coach doesn‚Äôt like R taking her lunches and breaks because she should just be doing surveys, which in all fairness, she‚Äôs doing this out of the kindness in her heart. Things really ramped up this week when she told me that this coach in question told her that our SM didn‚Äôt like that she was losing surveys these last few days. 

Why was she losing surveys you ask? It was her weekend. This coach then tried spinning a tale that the SM is asking her to stay in OGP for good. Dispensing, staging, prepping. I catch wind of this and ask R if she changed her career preferences recently, or if Mark has a printed request made by R for her to start working digital. I was ignored. 

I had R sign into her work phone to show her career preferences, and low behold, there were no changes, no transfer requests, nothing. I told her to open door this or at least talk to the SM. SM hears this when he comes back to work the next day and is fucking livid, chews out my coach, saying he never cleared this and he only asked her to do surveys. 

Coach and TL start grumbling because they didn‚Äôt want anyone blabbing about it and wondering who talked about it. I hate how smug she can be and how she thought she could get away with this. Now R is fearing retaliation and how she could lose her job. But I assured her that this is a huge ethics concern, and if anything, she can take it up the chain of command if that‚Äôs what it takes.

Last bit of detail, not as important, but another one of my coworkers, let‚Äôs call her C. She was injured on the job last night, took a wrong step on a dolly and twisted her ankle. My coach and TL tried blaming HER, saying that it had to look like an accident, and it can‚Äôt be reported if she did it to herself the way she did. 

Me being me, I asked my coach in this conversation what the local number for workers comp was, as that‚Äôs who she needed to call. Coach slimmed another tale saying there is NO workers comp and all files go through them and we just have to tell her word of mouth what happens. 

I don‚Äôt believe it. I tell C that I was injured on the job my first year in, and I had to call Workers Comp. I was given 12 weeks of PT and I was good as new. Coach disagrees with me, I ignore her and tell C that she needs names of witnesses, times and dates as those are the key factors that play into Workers Comp.

1gkeweg,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1gkeweg/ethics_concern_coach_committing_huge_fraud_and/,Ethics concern? Coach committing huge fraud and pulling associates: [Long rant],"First things first, it‚Äôs important to say I work in OGP just to get it out of the way. 

My coach is a chronic liar, I‚Äôve only worked at this store for a month (Walmart in total for 5 years) and the amount of lying she commits makes me believe that this is second nature to her. 

For example, on my weekend she decides to text me asking if I can come in to help. I say no, it‚Äôs my weekend, which she replies ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs Event 1‚Äù (this was like early October). My TL texts me asking when I‚Äôm coming in, which I say I‚Äôm not, and she replies ‚ÄúBut [Coach] said you agreed to come in.‚Äù I send her a screenshot of our texts and ask her to circle where I said that. I was left alone for the rest of the day. 

A few more examples but that‚Äôs a good standard for what we‚Äôre facing here. Onto the  main reason I write this post. 

My department has a huge metric fraud problem. I learned that there‚Äôs this thing called ‚Äúghost picking‚Äù. Essentially to boost metrics, FTPR (first time pick rate) and OTPR (on time pick rate), it has been encouraged to print vizpick labels of the items you‚Äôre missing, scan the vizpick label and then the OSN label on the tote to show that it was ‚Äúpicked‚Äù, and then that shopper goes in the backroom and hopefully finds it. If not, they go on the floor and pick something similar. 

3 times this week, myself alone have found that customers are very confused as to why on their receipt on the Walmart app they‚Äôre receiving two boxes of K-cups instead of their four bags of instant coffee. Or that it says we picked honey ham but there is no honey ham to be seen in their tote. 

It doesn‚Äôt say substituted, unavailable, or it was being delivered to their house, it says it was picked and it was because of this ghost picking. After confronting my coach about it, she says she doesn‚Äôt know anything about ghost picking‚Ä¶ which solves nothing. 

A good coach would be furious that their job is in jeopardy, have an immediate huddle and put a stop to it. Knowing her track record, I can only assume she‚Äôs the one that started encouraging it. 

_____

Slightly off track but I wanted to mention a few things about my fellow associates:

This last week a key host from HBA (we‚Äôll call her R) has been helping with surveys. Our SM had offered this to her to expand a little and help with our metrics. All R does is talk to customers when we dispense an order, give them a piece of candy, and ask if they can give us five stars. Pretty harmless. 

I have been giving her advice on how things are supposed to work, because this is her first month at Walmart period. She knows how toxic our backroom is and how nasty a woman my coach and TL can be. 

My coach doesn‚Äôt like R taking her lunches and breaks because she should just be doing surveys, which in all fairness, she‚Äôs doing this out of the kindness in her heart.

I have been reading around the sub for a while and could do with some advice. I have a young family and couldn‚Äôt really justify spending over ¬£300 at once. I do like to mod things though, so I would be willing to upgrade in the future, but unlikely to replace the whole setup. I also don‚Äôt really have any available counter space in the kitchen at the minute.
I am friends with the cafe manager at my work and they let me make a few flat whites for us each morning on their Rancillio Invicta 2 group machine. I‚Äôve even got the hang of basic latte art!
I would normally get a coffee at work during the week, like I mentioned above, so it is likely to be 2 or 3 flat whites, espressos or long blacks for myself each day at the weekend with the occasional time even I would make 2 for myself and a guest. I am mostly drinking flat whites at the minute and that is mostly for latte art practice!  My wife prefers instant.
I already have a Knock Feldgrind hand grinder that I happily use to make a 3 cup moka pot at weekends. I know I would need to grind finer for espresso but would this be suitable at least to start off with (ideally forever)?
I‚Äôm expecting most of the recommendations to be for GCP or Silvia but is one better than the other either initially, or with future modding in mind?
Regarding mods, I know of the Gaggiuino, but is there anything else I should know about?
Finally, I assume second hand is the way to go, but what should I be looking out for?

1gketb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1gketb9/crazy_expectations/,Crazy Expectations,"Need a bit of advice on how to approach a situation. I am in a role now for almost a year and a half & plan on staying. There are definitely pros and I feel very lucky. I understand what I'm doing (for the most part), I work from home 3 days a week, and I'm on ‚Ç¨47k with small increments each year. However, I was given very little support and training when I started and was dumped with lots of responsibility. 

The turnover of staff is unbelievable and the team is tiny so I have a very large workload sometimes as I end up helping with every single part of the business. Sometimes it's quiet so it kind of balances out. Everyone else bar 2 people get to work pretty much fully remotely so the office is pretty cavernous. They have previously expected me to pay out of my own pocket for milk & post etc. I politely pushed back on this as I think this is highly inappropriate, especially as I'm expected to do quite a lot and I'm not in a junior role (I was regraded as they had me at a lower grade than I should have been). Tbh I don't think anyone should ever be asked to buy milk or make coffee for people, personally.

I do payroll, manage all invoicing & maintain a detailed  purchase order schedule, assist with the audit, order office supplies, help with events (catering, supplies for the registration desk, attending events etc.), I have been asked to help facilitate workshops, do voice overs for promotional videos, do videos taking to the streets asking people about a topic, assist with project management for a national programme, and now in January I will project lead for two new programmes being set up but for no extra pay (in the hopes that it will lead to something but nothing has been promised or discussed at all). 

Everytime someone new starts they dump them on me to train them in even when they are my senior and not in my department so I can't show them much but end up showing them how to do basic things because they keep hiring people who can't click their mouse, open their emails, read an Excel workbook etc. so I end up spending hours with them and then frantically trying to catch up on work. When I started, I was left for weeks with no work and then people who worked here for years would ask me where the paper was when I hadn't been shown. They told me to show a new person around the grounds & show them the canteen etc. when I had never been shown & was only there a few weeks and didn't know where anything was because we're in a separate building away from everything. 

Recently, they hired a part-time temp and I'm the only one who can show her the work so it's all on me despite having a large workload. If she needs to change her days in the office they expect me to organize her schedule and I have to sit with her for hours each day showing her things. I have written up very easy step by step notes for her, sat with her and gone through things slowly. She's not using any of my notes and is slow to pick things up and management are not helping at all. I have shown myself to be conscientious and it's really starting to break me down because I can't keep doing all of this with so little support. They say they're happy to help but in practice that's just not the case. How do you take a step back without seeming rude?  ",2,1730834338.0,WorkAdvice,4,1.0,False

Hi - I‚Äôm 34, with low amh (2.8 - think that converts to .4?). My first test was in Aug 23 (4.8 - maybe concerts to .6), so there‚Äôs been a decline in reserve. I‚Äôm single, trying to date but it‚Äôs going nowhere. I started egg freezing last year and have been thru 5 cycles since - last 3 cycles were cancelled and the first two resulted in 4 eggs. The last cycle was the lupron protocol, I thought that would be a good one but on day 8 I had 4 eggs at 1cm and 1 lead follicle at 1.8, so my Dr wanted to cancel. She‚Äôs now asking me to take a break stating that receptors can get potentially less efficient from constant stimulation. She‚Äôs also saying that my FSH hasn‚Äôt been over 10 through this while except one month when it was 16.

Q2. Should I try another clinic? I stuck it out here because we tried different protocols each time and it‚Äôs close to home etc. But wondering if I should get another opinion? I‚Äôm in Toronto in case anyone has recs.

Here's an excerpt (translated to the best of my abilities):

> In the middle of my education, in February, I was mobilized to the country administration of <redacted by me>. They told me that I wouldn't need to graduate for the things that I'd have to do there. Together with another high-schooler, who had experienced the same, I was sworn in by the district administrator to handle classified documents. We were both daughters of politically untrustworthy fathers. We were forbidden under threat of death to talk about the nature of our work. Access to our room was limited to the district administrator and his assessor. The district admin made no bones about his stance on Hitler. He had a Dutch wife, who supplied us with coffee and other goodies. On 8/31/1939 I was requested by the district admin to take over telephone duties between 6pm and the following morning. He told me that I should wake him if there was a special call from the government. The code word came at 3am. After that, all surrounding mayoralities had to be informed. It was the start of the war. It would take too long, to list all the details here.

Naturally, that last sentence made me wonder what exactly went down at that point. How much did the regional governments know about what was about to happen? How did they proceed after the war started? Did they have a lot of time to prepare for the war, and did they have a rough timeline about what was planned, or were they mostly in the dark about the details?

Jason woke in the early hours of the morning, his heart racing, his skin damp with sweat as the last remnants of a dream slipped through his fingers. He lay frozen, staring up at the dark ceiling, as he tried to capture the scattered fragments still lingering in his mind. The images were vivid yet disjointed‚Äîa landscape that was both familiar and foreign, a place where every detail felt slightly askew, as if viewed through the haze of a memory he couldn't fully recall. He could still feel the damp air pressing against his skin, the whisper of leaves rustling in a wind that seemed to carry voices just out of reach.

He closed his eyes, trying to summon the details, but they darted away like shadows retreating from light. There had been a path, lined with towering trees that seemed to arch overhead, their branches weaving together like the ribs of some vast, ancient creature. He remembered a feeling of being pulled forward, like an invisible thread was leading him, tugging at him, urging him deeper into the heart of the forest. And somewhere, just beyond the trees, he felt something‚Äîor someone‚Äîwaiting for him.

A name lingered on his tongue, fading even as he became aware of it: *Lily.* He felt sure she had been there, in that strange dreamscape, though he couldn‚Äôt place her presence. It was as if she had been just out of sight, her voice blending with the wind, her laughter echoing faintly in the distance. In the pit of his stomach, he felt a sense of loss, of separation, though he couldn‚Äôt understand why. They were bound somehow, tied together by invisible threads he could sense even now, but in the dream, she had felt distant, unreachable.

Jason turned onto his side, frustration building as the pieces slipped further from his grasp. It was more than a dream; it had been a message, or maybe a memory of a place he was supposed to find, a part of his life he had yet to live or maybe had already lived before. He tried to steady his breathing, closing his eyes and letting the silence of the room settle over him, but the uneasy feeling remained, a quiet whisper at the edge of his thoughts, pulling him back toward that strange, elusive vision.

He glanced at his phone, debating whether to text Lily. He wanted to tell her about the dream, even if it sounded crazy. But what would he say? That he had dreamed of her in a place he couldn‚Äôt name, feeling a connection he couldn‚Äôt explain? Before he could overthink it, he typed out a quick message.

**Jason:** *Hey. Are you up? Can you meet me at our usual spot?*

He hit send, his heart pounding as he waited for her response. It was barely dawn, and the sky outside his window was a deep, inky blue, tinged with the faintest hint of morning light. For a moment, he worried she‚Äôd think he was crazy, that showing up at this hour with nothing but a strange dream would make him seem unhinged. But the sense of urgency gnawed at him, growing stronger with every passing minute.

A few seconds later, his phone buzzed with a response.

**Lily:** *Yeah. Couldn‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôll be there in 10.*

He exhaled, feeling a strange mixture of relief and tension as he grabbed his jacket and headed out into the chilly morning air. The streets were deserted, the world wrapped in the quiet stillness that only existed before dawn. As he made his way to the park, the dream replayed in his mind, images flashing before his eyes like fleeting snapshots‚Äîthe towering trees, the shadowy path, the feeling of being pulled toward something he couldn‚Äôt see.

When he reached their spot beneath the old maple tree, Lily was already there, sitting quietly on the bench, her face softened by the pale light of dawn. She was staring out over the pond, lost in thought, and as he approached, she gave him a faint, tired smile.

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep either, huh?‚Äù she said softly, her voice carrying a hint of weariness, though her eyes held that same distant, searching look he‚Äôd seen more often lately.

He nodded, feeling a little ridiculous but pushing through. ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Ä¶ I had this dream, and it‚Äôs been bugging me all morning. I couldn‚Äôt shake it.‚Äù

Her eyes widened slightly, a glimmer of recognition flickering across her face. ‚ÄúLet me guess‚Ä¶ a forest? Tall trees, a winding path?‚Äù

Jason‚Äôs pulse quickened, a chill running down his spine. ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù

She looked away, her fingers tracing the thin scars of the bench. ‚ÄúI had the same dream. It was‚Ä¶ unsettling. I felt like I was supposed to find something‚Äîor someone. I kept hearing your voice, but every time I tried to follow it, you‚Äôd disappear.‚Äù

Jason exhaled, feeling the weight of the dream settle more heavily over them, their shared experience deepening the strange bond between them. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like we were‚Ä¶ there, together. But it didn‚Äôt feel like a normal dream. It felt real, like a memory.‚Äù

Lily nodded slowly, her brow furrowing. ‚ÄúExactly. It was as if we‚Äôd been there before, or maybe‚Ä¶ like we‚Äôre supposed to go there.‚Äù

They sat in silence, each grappling with the implications of their shared vision. Jason took a step closer, his voice low, as if speaking too loudly might break the spell.

‚ÄúDo you think‚Ä¶ do you think it means something? All of this?‚Äù He gestured between them, his voice filled with a mixture of awe and fear. ‚ÄúThe dreams, the strange coincidences, even our families‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs something hidden, something connecting us that we can‚Äôt see.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs gaze softened, her eyes searching his with a depth that made his breath catch. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said quietly, her voice carrying a tremor she couldn‚Äôt quite hide. ‚ÄúBut it feels like we‚Äôre meant to find out, doesn‚Äôt it? Like maybe everything has been leading us here, to this.‚Äù

She reached out, her fingers intertwining with his, grounding him with a warmth that contrasted sharply with the chill in the air. Her hand was small but steady, a silent reassurance that they would face whatever lay ahead together. Jason felt the tension in his chest ease, her presence a calm amidst the unknown.

‚ÄúWhatever this is,‚Äù she continued, her voice filled with quiet determination, ‚Äúwhatever‚Äôs pulling us together, I think we‚Äôre supposed to see it through.‚Äù

Jason gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. ‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll see it through. Together.‚Äù

They sat beneath the maple tree, a silent promise hanging in the air between them, unspoken but understood.

As the weeks went on, the strange synchronicities only intensified. It was no longer just the occasional finishing of each other‚Äôs sentences or mirroring each other‚Äôs gestures. It became something deeper, something that seemed to weave through their days like an invisible thread. Jason would begin a sentence, only to have Lily finish it in perfect alignment, her voice echoing his thoughts as if she‚Äôd pulled the words directly from his mind. At first, they laughed it off, their shared amusement a balm against the growing strangeness. But as it happened more frequently, laughter gave way to shared glances filled with unspoken questions.

They‚Äôd reach for the same item at the same time, their hands brushing in a way that felt electric, charged with a familiarity they couldn‚Äôt explain. Sometimes, they‚Äôd both move to do something in unison, like turning to look out a window or walking in the same direction without speaking. It was as if they were tethered together by an unseen force, their movements and thoughts flowing as one, without the need for words.

Then there were the memories‚Äîhalf-formed, shadowy recollections that seemed to bleed into their conversations, slipping through the cracks of their shared moments. They‚Äôd talk about childhood experiences, only to stumble upon details that didn‚Äôt quite add up, moments that felt like they belonged to both of them and yet, somehow, to neither.

One evening, as they sat on a park bench beneath the fading light of dusk, Jason started talking about a family trip to a lake. He could picture it vividly‚Äîthe cool morning air, the mist rising from the water, and the way his family had rented a small red rowboat. He remembered dangling his hand over the side, trailing his fingers through the rippling water as they drifted lazily across the lake.

Lily‚Äôs face lit up as he spoke, and she chimed in, almost without thinking. ‚ÄúWe did that too. We went to this lake up north, and I remember my family renting a boat‚Ä¶ though ours was blue. I used to let my fingers trail through the water too, watching the ripples spread.‚Äù She laughed softly, as though reliving a cherished memory. But then her brow furrowed, her expression tinged with confusion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so strange, though. It feels like‚Ä¶ like I can almost picture your red boat too, even though I know we never had one.‚Äù

Jason felt a chill creep down his spine, a strange mixture of recognition and disorientation washing over him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ weird,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúI can picture the blue boat now, like I‚Äôve seen it somewhere before, even though I know that‚Äôs not right.‚Äù

They exchanged a glance, both sensing the eerie similarity between their memories, the way the details overlapped yet contradicted each other, like two halves of a story struggling to fit.

Later, the topic came up again when they were grabbing groceries together. They were wandering down the aisles, laughing about some of the strange items they found, when Lily stopped abruptly, her eyes narrowing as though a distant memory had resurfaced.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she began, her voice soft and reflective, ‚Äúwhen I was a kid, I used to be terrified of getting separated from my mom in places like this. The tall shelves made me feel so small, like they were closing in on me. I got lost once‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jason nodded, almost instinctively, feeling a strange familiarity with her words that made his chest tighten. ‚ÄúIt was in the cereal aisle,‚Äù he interrupted, the words slipping out without thought. ‚ÄúYou stood there, calling out, but it was so crowded that no one could hear you. And you‚Äî‚Äù he hesitated, suddenly aware of how strange it was that he knew this, that he could feel it so vividly. ‚ÄúYou were holding a box of‚Ä¶ Frosted Flakes, right?‚Äù

Lily froze, her eyes widening as she stared at him in shock. ‚ÄúJason, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never told anyone about the Frosted Flakes. I didn‚Äôt even remember that part until just now.‚Äù

The color drained from Jason‚Äôs face as he tried to reconcile what he‚Äôd just said, how he could know something so specific, something she‚Äôd never shared. He could practically see her there, a small, frightened child clutching the box, her wide eyes darting around as the shelves towered over her, the fluorescent lights casting long shadows that only deepened her fear.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I knew that,‚Äù he admitted, shaking his head, as a chill ran through him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like I can picture it. Like I was there.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs hands trembled slightly as she tightened her grip on the grocery cart, her gaze distant, unfocused. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand this, Jason. How can you know something that I barely remember myself?‚Äù

They stood there in the middle of the aisle, surrounded by shelves of cereal and brightly colored boxes, but it felt like they were the only two people in the world. The strange connection between them, the feeling that their lives were somehow woven together in ways they couldn‚Äôt explain, pressed down on them, as if an invisible force was pulling them closer, binding them in a web they couldn‚Äôt yet see.

‚ÄúDo you think‚Ä¶‚Äù Jason began, his voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúDo you think there‚Äôs more to this than just coincidence? Like‚Ä¶ maybe our lives have been connected somehow, even before we met.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs eyes met his, a flicker of fear and wonder mingling in her gaze. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs starting to feel that way,‚Äù she admitted.

The eerie familiarity between them only grew, as if their lives were blending together. Then, one afternoon, as they strolled down the main street on their way to grab coffee, they passed an old craft store with a weathered sign, and Jason felt a pang of d√©j√† vu.

Jason‚Äôs gaze was drawn to an old, weathered shop on the corner, tucked between more modern storefronts. It looked out of place, like a remnant from another time, its exterior worn by years of wind and weather. The paint was faded, a washed-out shade that might have once been a cheerful yellow but now looked more like dull ochre. The windows were thick with dust, obscuring whatever lay inside, and an old wooden sign above the door read ‚ÄúCrafter‚Äôs Cove‚Äù in chipped, curling letters that barely caught the light. A collection of wind chimes hung from the awning, tangled and silent, swaying faintly as though stirred by some unseen force.

Jason slowed, staring at the shop with a sense of familiarity that prickled at the edge of his mind. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve been here before,‚Äù he murmured, the words slipping out without thought. His family would never have come here; they weren‚Äôt the type to venture into small, odd craft stores. And yet, as he looked at the faded storefront, he felt a pull, like a thread connecting him to something he couldn‚Äôt name.

Lily nodded, looking at the store with a faint smile. ‚ÄúI remember coming here with my family once, but I know it looked‚Ä¶ different somehow. Like it wasn‚Äôt so faded and rundown.‚Äù

Jason nodded, feeling an inexplicable urge to keep looking, to push through the dusty glass and discover what lay hidden inside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ a dream I can‚Äôt remember.‚Äù

Lily took a step closer, peering at the dimly lit window. ‚ÄúI remember‚Ä¶ my mom was looking for paints or something, and there were these cute little sculptures on a shelf near the front,‚Äù she said slowly, as if piecing together the memory as she spoke.

‚ÄúThey were little clay animals,‚Äù Jason interrupted, surprising himself. ‚ÄúA tiny fox, a rabbit with a little chipped ear, and‚Ä¶ a turtle painted in shades of blue and green, with a little flower on its shell.‚Äù

Lily turned to him, her mouth falling open in shock. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she whispered, her eyes wide with disbelief. ‚ÄúExactly like that. The fox was painted orange with these tiny white spots, and the rabbit looked like it was about to hop away.‚Äù

Jason shook his head, his heart pounding. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been in this store. I‚Äôve never seen those sculptures in my life, Lily. But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like I know them. Like they‚Äôre etched into my memory, even though I‚Äôve never set foot in there.‚Äù

They stood there, the dusty windows and faded paint somehow feeling more significant, more alive, than the bustling street around them. Jason could almost see the sculptures on the shelf just inside the door, could picture the way the light would catch the colors, the way his fingers would itch to reach out and touch them.

Jason shivered, the sensation creeping over him like a cold mist settling into his bones. The logical part of his mind insisted it was nothing, that it was just an odd series of coincidences layered on top of a natural connection. But he couldn‚Äôt deny the feeling that lurked just beneath the surface, a quiet certainty that there was more to this than chance. It was like he and Lily were only seeing the edges of something vast and complex, a puzzle they were part of without fully understanding its shape.

They continued walking, the shared silence stretching between them. Jason‚Äôs thoughts churned, trying to grasp what all of this meant. Every instinct told him that something lay hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be unearthed. He felt like a traveler lost in a maze, each turn pulling him closer to a truth he could sense but not yet see. It was as if he and Lily held two halves of the same story, both essential but incomplete, their lives tangled together by a force beyond either of their control.

Finally, he broke the silence. ‚ÄúDo you think‚Ä¶ do you think there‚Äôs something we‚Äôre supposed to remember? Something we‚Äôve both forgotten?‚Äù

Lily glanced at him, her eyes reflecting the same confusion and curiosity he felt. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she admitted, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm on the edge of a memory I can‚Äôt reach, like something‚Äôs pulling me toward it but it‚Äôs just out of sight.‚Äù

They shared a look, the weight of unspoken questions pressing down on them, wrapping around them like an invisible thread drawing tighter with each passing day. The puzzle pieces continued to hover just beyond their grasp, teasing them with glimpses of a truth that felt both inevitable and unknowable.

¬†

One night, they lay stretched out on a blanket in the grass, their breaths visible in the cool air as they stared up at the vast night sky. The stars sparkled above them, like fragments of secrets too old to be understood, scattered across the universe. The silence stretched around them, punctuated only by the occasional rustling of leaves and the distant hum of the world beyond. They‚Äôd been talking for hours, sharing fragments of their pasts, trying to trace the lines that seemed to connect them‚Äîbut every detail only led them back to the same unsettling truth, a realization neither of them could name but both felt.

Jason finally broke the silence, his voice quiet and hesitant. ‚ÄúDo you think‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused, swallowing hard, as if saying it out loud would make it all too real. ‚ÄúDo you think maybe‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve known each other before?‚Äù

Lily turned to look at him, her eyes wide and searching. Her face was cast in shadows, her expression unreadable, but he could see the flicker of something in her gaze, something he couldn‚Äôt name. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ in another life?‚Äù she whispered, as if afraid of the answer.

Jason shrugged, though he felt a strange sense of relief in voicing the thought that had been plaguing him, haunting him, since their first encounter. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It sounds crazy, but‚Ä¶ there are things about you, about us, that just feel like‚Ä¶ like they‚Äôve always been there.‚Äù He could feel his heart pounding, his mind racing with the impossible possibility that they were somehow part of each other‚Äôs story long before now.

Lily took a deep, shaky breath, her gaze drifting back to the sky. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve felt that too,‚Äù she murmured, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúLike I‚Äôve known you before. Like meeting you wasn‚Äôt the first time, but‚Ä¶ the first time I can remember.‚Äù She hugged her knees to her chest, the vulnerability in her posture mirroring the tension growing between them. ‚ÄúBut what does that even mean, Jason? Are we‚Ä¶ Are we supposed to be together? Is this all just fate, or‚Ä¶ or something else?‚Äù

Jason felt a tightness in his chest, an ache he couldn‚Äôt explain. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But what if it‚Äôs all just some‚Ä¶ cosmic fluke? Like maybe we‚Äôre reading too much into this because we want it to mean something?‚Äù He hated the thought, but he couldn‚Äôt ignore it either. They were falling together so easily, as if by some design, yet the mystery of it all was beginning to weigh on him, filling him with a mixture of wonder and dread.

Lily‚Äôs face tightened, her confusion clear as she stared into the night. ‚ÄúBut it doesn‚Äôt feel like a fluke,‚Äù she whispered, her voice laced with desperation. ‚ÄúEvery time we talk, every memory we share, it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, like we‚Äôre peeling back layers of something that‚Äôs been buried. Something that we‚Äôre supposed to find.‚Äù She turned to him, her eyes glistening in the dim light. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a past life, or fate, or‚Ä¶ or maybe it‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶‚Äù She faltered, her voice catching, and then she forced herself to finish. ‚ÄúOr maybe it‚Äôs just that we‚Äôre supposed to love each other.‚Äù

Jason‚Äôs breath caught at her words, his heart racing as he struggled to process the implications. The idea of love felt almost too simple, too human to explain what they were experiencing, yet it was the only answer that felt real, something he could understand in a world that suddenly felt vast and unknowable. ‚ÄúBut why, Lily?‚Äù he asked, his voice laced with a quiet desperation. ‚ÄúWhy would love feel this way? Why would it come with‚Ä¶ with memories that aren‚Äôt ours, and feelings that don‚Äôt make sense?‚Äù

They lay there in silence, the weight of their questions pressing down on them, suffocating and profound. Jason reached for her hand, lacing his fingers through hers, grounding himself in the warmth of her touch, the one tangible thing he could hold onto in the midst of so much uncertainty.

‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôre not supposed to know,‚Äù he said finally, his voice a rough whisper. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs enough to just‚Ä¶ be here, together, and let whatever this is unfold. Maybe it‚Äôll make sense one day, or maybe it never will. But I can‚Äôt deny that‚Ä¶ that I‚Äôm meant to be here, right now, with you.‚Äù

Lily squeezed his hand, her grip tight, like she was afraid he‚Äôd disappear if she let go. ‚ÄúI feel the same,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm scared, Jason. I‚Äôm scared of what this means, of what we‚Äôll find if we keep looking.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù he admitted, his heart heavy with the weight of their shared fear. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm more scared of walking away, of never knowing what this really is.‚Äù

They lay in silence, clutching each other‚Äôs hands as if they were lifelines, tethered together by a force neither of them could understand. And as the stars shimmered above them, endless and unreachable, they felt like two small pieces caught in something much bigger, a story too vast for them to comprehend, yet one they were bound to unravel, together.

I started egg freezing last year and have been thru 5 cycles since - last 3 cycles were cancelled and the first two resulted in 4 eggs.

I recently launched a web app, [Amor Software](https://amor.software/), to help small businesses with social media and blogging. It‚Äôs designed to take the load off business owners who need content but don‚Äôt have the time or budget to hire a writer or social media manager. I‚Äôd love some honest feedback from you all!

Here‚Äôs the basic idea:

1. **Enter Your Business & Products:** You pop in your website URL and a few product links.
2. **Get Social Media Posts:** The app generates tailored social media posts for your products to help you engage with your audience.
3. **Generate Blog Posts:** It can also research a topic and create blog posts and content specific to your business niche. For instance, a coffee shop might get a blog about ‚ÄúHow Coffee Boosts Productivity,‚Äù or a fitness studio could get ‚ÄúBenefits of Staying Active as You Age.‚Äù

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on a few things:

* **Design & User Experience:** Is the look and feel appealing and easy to use?
* **The Concept:** Does this idea sound useful? If not, any tweaks you‚Äôd suggest?
* **Important Features:** Are there specific features/details that you look for when creating content for your business?
* **Anything Missing?** What features or improvements would make it even better?

And if any of you have tips on how to get the word out and bring in some users, I‚Äôm all ears! I know this is mainly a feedback post, but any marketing advice would be a huge bonus.

To show you appreciation for your time, **I‚Äôm offering free credits to anyone who gives solid feedback.** So if you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôd love for you to try it out and tell me what you think!

Thanks so much for reading, and I can‚Äôt wait to hear what you all have to say!",1,1730833389.0,alphaandbetausers,0,1.0,False

He berates me, disrespects me, and has to have the last word.
He doesn‚Äôt know how to communicate, he only knows to get very defensive and argumentative. 
Everything needs to be his way. I need to agree with everything he says, otherwise to HIM I am arguing. 
I just have a different opinion.

One major thing than I‚Äôm having a hard time looking passed is how he doubles down on instances where he really was nothing but controlling and abusive. 
There was one time we went to Spain to vacation, around Christmas time so it was very cold. I had mild symptoms of the flu before I went but there was no way a little cold would stop me from going. We walked a TON during the day whilst there, and as I said it was very cold! So my symptoms did end up getting worse, but I tried to make the most of my trip. 
There was one day that we shared a hot coco and a coffee, both containing sugar. That same night, we went back at our hotel and I‚Äôm coughing like a monster. What makes it worse is my husband insisted I had flem, and I needed to spit out the flem every time I cough. I in fact did NOT have a flemmy cough, it was dry and itchy. But every time I coughed, I had to pretend to spit flem out. If I didn‚Äôt, he would say ‚Äúyou obviously don‚Äôt want to get better if you aren‚Äôt doing what I tell you.‚Äù 
As I was saying, I wanted to soothe my throat so I ended up making a cup of tea. I grew up drinking hot tea with a small amount of sugar, that‚Äôs just the way our culture drinks tea. Anyways, I was literally in the middle of pouring a tiny teaspoon of sugar into my tea when my husband sees, and immediately he starts with his BS. ‚ÄúWhy the hell are you putting sugar in your tea if you‚Äôre coughing? Don‚Äôt you want to get better?‚Äù I say I do, but this is how I enjoy tea. And we had no honey since it was a hotel. I just wanted something warm for my throat.
Again, he goes ‚Äúyou‚Äôre stubborn. You don‚Äôt listen, and you‚Äôre disobedient and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre not getting better.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even get a sip of the tea I was so sickened with the way he was yelling at me. I poured it out and we argued a lot. 

So me being in super cold weather in the middle of winter, hiking for hours, and coming TO the trip with symptoms couldn‚Äôt possibly be the reason my cold isn‚Äôt going away, right? Also, my immune system was tanked after getting Covid, and that‚Äôs why it was hard to get over colds. Mind you, there was one night early on I even had a fever! Did he ever mention getting some rest for one day maybe? Staying at the hotel to feel better? No. Not once. Did he nag me when we shared a hot coco which has SUGAR. No. Did he nag me when I had a few sips of the coffee? No, because we were sharing it. But suddenly when I wanted to make MYSELF a tea with a TINY AMOUNT OF SUGAR, I‚Äôm ‚Äúdisobedient.‚Äù
I‚Äôm sick and tired of trying to explain this to my husband. Why doesn‚Äôt he fucking get it that he can‚Äôt talk to me like this. I have tried so many different ways to get it through his skull but he ALWAYS doubles down on why he acted the way he did. He‚Äôs never truly apologetic about it. 

It feels so unfair that I try so hard to have discussions and he ONLY argues. He thinks everything is an invitation to fight, as if he enjoys it. I blame his childhood but he‚Äôs a grown man now, and can stop if he really tried. 5 years later, I see no improvement in his communication skills AT ALL. I‚Äôm so sick and tired.

I'm 27F, remote software engineer moving to Chicago from next year! I‚Äôd love some advice on the best neighborhoods to match my lifestyle!

Here's what I'm looking for:

* **Budget**: Up to $2,500/month for rent for a luxury 1 bedroom. I could go to up $2700 too.
* **Lifestyle**: I‚Äôd love to live in a high-rise with nice amenities and a professional crowd
* **Social Life**: I don't drink or smoke but would love to meet folks through meetup groups. I wanna explore my interest in writing so maybe I'd join some writing clubs, book clubs, or become a member at a museum. I am extroverted but usually lead a low-key life. Love to eat out and explore coffee shops or any events/markets that opened up for the season. I meditate and workout a lot too so could join groups for those.
* **Dating Scene**: I'm single and would actually love to start dating. Would love to meet guys off the apps (ideally) who are in their late 20s or early to mid 30s
* **Gym**: I'd love proximity to a top tier bodybuilding gym
* **Daily Essentials**: I'm coming from Arlington, VA where I didn't have a car. I can get a car but would ideally like to avoid dealing with maintaining a car in Chicago so walking proximity is essential. Would like to be within 5-10 mins walking distance from grocery stores.

Please let me know what the best month to move is too! Would it be Feb so I can possibly get a better deal on the rent?

I've been considering¬†**Streeterville**,¬†**Gold Coast**,¬†**South Loop**,¬†**Old Town**, and¬†**River North**¬†(with some concerns about the nightlife there). For those who know these areas, would they suit what I‚Äôm looking for, or is there another neighborhood I should be considering?

If any of you live in quieter parts of River North and have tips on finding buildings that avoid the bar noise and weekend crowds, I‚Äôd love to hear your experience!

Also, if you live in Chicago and wanna be friends, I'd love to e-meet you as well!

Is this salvageable? ,"It sounds terrible when I read that in isolation but let me explain. I (29M) had been with someone (28F) who lived a distance away for several years then Covid (2020-2021) happened and we grew apart. I saw them once when Covid restrictions lifted somewhat at the end of 2021‚Äìwe met and had a coffee and caught up. I don‚Äôt know why, but I just couldn‚Äôt find the courage to formally break up. We just wasn‚Äôt a thing, we hardly spoke and didn‚Äôt see each other again in person and eventually stopped talking altogether. Enter my partner (29F) who has been in my life for years as a friend, but wanted to be friends with benefits. She knew I was with someone, but I was frank and said things weren‚Äôt going to last between us. We then slowly started to see one another casually, nothing with labels, it was largely friends with benefits. This would have been around November 2021. My partner began to feel bad about the blurred lines between the relationships, and would ask if it was over and I would say yes, because it felt like it was. 

Fast forward to 2023, me and my partner have had a lot of ups and downs. Shes ended our informal relationship several times. At one point openly said that she met someone at work she wanted to try things with and dropped me to pursue that. It fizzled out and she decided to travel instead, returning because she‚Äôd run out of cash in late 2023. We caught up and we slowly resumed where had been. Throughout this she‚Äôs always been clear that we are faithful to one another, if we want to pursue other people fine, but be open about it‚ÄîI never did want to. Now it‚Äôs 2024, we were meant to meet to have a conversation about us and the future‚Äîit felt like things might actually become serious. But 30 minutes before the meeting she messaged to say she‚Äôd contacted my ex and couldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd lied (presumably about not formally ending things). I‚Äôm a bit puzzled how an ex relationship that ended in what felt like 2019 has somehow ended something that has been so informal since 2021. Am I being an idiot? Is this salvageable?

We are living in a time when the number of people who are extraordinarily devoted to their talent is decreasing, and I see everywhere that there is less place in present-day society for those of extraordinary talent, because of the general tendency to level off the peaks and make everyone equal, and not accept that there are natural differences among people.

We are living in a time when the number of people who are extraordinarily devoted to their talent is decreasing, and I see everywhere that there is less place in present-day society for those of extraordinary talent, because of the general tendency to level off the peaks and make everyone equal, and not accept that there are natural differences among people. It's completely absurd to be in a social situation where you feel obliged to defend yourself for what you are.

>I respond to sounds. Sound is my air. Whenever I deal with sounds, they organize themselves, so to speak. They respond very well to me and I to them. When a sound comes into my fingers in the studio or anywhere else, I can immediately place it in an environment of sounds. I have intuitive visions of sound-worlds, music, and a great pleasure in sitting down and writing the music, that's all. And I see some of my colleagues, and they simply can't sit still for more than a few hours without needing a coffee or to do something else. My greatest pleasure is to sit for ten or twelve hours and compose, or work in the studio. It's marvellous.",2,1730832778.0,composer,0,1.0,False

1gke4jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1gke4jd/true_love_story/,True love story ,"  Not sure were to begin in what has been the most wildest relationship roller-coaster I've ever been on ü•¥. So I guess I'll just take it from the start

                       THE START

  Meeting you felt like a movie from the start!... you instantly melted my heart from the moment I saw you to our first date having our Cawffee at warbler.(still thought it was spelled coffee then üò¨) Those early days it saddened me to see such a beautiful woman and presumably beautiful soul to have so much sadness behind those beautiful eyes that longed to be happy again. I felt an instant connection that felt like a bolt of lightning that struck through my veins. Through the days I would get to know you and we'd go through our adventures at local restaurants you'd never been to, to my empty apartmentü´£, to meeting all your friends and co-workers(which were awesome and love you so much) every day with you no matter what we did seem to be undoubtedly the best days I'd had in a very very long time! And then to make things even more like a movie it would turn out that we were both about to start a big new chapter in our lives that had us leaving our hometown and loved ones behind.

                  New cities, Same us x2
   
   Moving to a New city seemed to only bring us closer together and further strengthen our bond as best friends and lovers and soul mates. I couldn't help but feel that I had met my person in this world. From movie nights at your new place, to pizza and popcorn nights at mine. To theater moments at the palladium in your town to Alamo drafthouse movie nights in mine(pizza and wine). To San Marcos and Schertz at our meet in the middle nights. To our ride back to Brownsville together times. I was indeed convinced I was living in a movie better than any of our movie nights combined.

                        The Twist üòî 
  Every movie has one... a twist. And often times art imitates life.... and our story was no exception. Your ex lover would be moving in with you to be your roommate üòµ‚Äçüí´ü§ïüíîü§î. My mind was telling me to spare myself the trouble and heartache and just run. Sentiments that everyone close to me also shared. They advised me and some even demanded i run away and stay away. But the heart had other ideas... the heart wanted to believe in hope, in you and in love. All of a sudden logic was swept out the window and nobody's opinion was valid nor wanted. After all they hadn't seen our intense connection! Our Tawlkes(use to think it was talks) that would last hours upon hours!!! (Believe our record was close to 7 hours straight!!! ü§Ø) Nor the hell you had claimed that this guy had put you through and were fed up with and ready to move on from to move with a person that truly could put a smile on your face and make you feel happy for the first time in a long time! Theceay i was doing! How could I leave, I wouldn't leave!, Our love could surely pull us through this temporary moment and would reward us with a lifetime of happiness.... right?    

                          WRONG!!!!!

    Not much Details are needed at this part of the roller-coaster. You would indeed end up sleeping and fucking your ex lover.... Lies, deceit, betrayal and confusion now rained down with havoc and no remorse like the bhola cyclone! Once again the heart was wrong, I was wrong. The once upon a time Movie of true love and fate was now a nightmare and horror movie instead! Eerily and rightfully unraveling in the middle of October. (Spooky season!  Fuck you! Spooky season) was it all a ruse? Had the connection just been in my head? Had all our talwks just been littered with lies with a trickle of truths? It must have beenüòîüòîüòî.and what is the only thing worse than the ruthless betrayal of sleeping with him?


                      The LIES

The trail of ruthless lies! Over and over and over again. And then over again. Even after everything I wanted to seek for something in you that could once again ignite my heart that for reasons unknown was still in it. It couldn't have all been a lie? Well.... that was rewarded with more and more lies... the movie was now slowly coming to a dreadful end.
   
                        SELF - REFLECTION 

   As I self reflect on it all, the best thing I can do now is shut the heart up and now finally go with the logic. The facts are, he meant more to you than I ever could. Why else would you throw us away to go back to him?. You used me to get him back and it worked....(good play) the lies and lies that would ensue were just extra toppings on what was a well planned orchestra of deceit. With all the information at hand I will always remember this as the time I was most wrong about someone ever in my life. 

                           In conclusion 

   Life doesn't always have a happy ending. Not even in movies üòî. At the end we are 2 human beings just trying to navigate through this crazy world the best we can. All the great times we had will always be cherished.... there was just too many. It was just being next to you, it was just seeing you smile and hearing your laugh that gave me the biggest joy of all! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èand I'm glad to have atleast been a part of that, lie or not. For atleast for a moment love and fate seemed more than possible, it seemed real!. They say only fools rush in, and that's exactly what I did, so the ending should have never really been a surprise after all(my bad). At the very end you showered me with absolut truths about us and you and everything!. I hope these truths will bring you solace as it has to me. I will forever deeply appreciate that! Thank you!!! Thank you so much. (Wish you had done that from the beginning) As we both turn into new chapters in our lives I wish you nothing but luck at your new place and with Sergio. You see I believe that no one truly deserves happiness nor a fairytale ending, but that one must do their best to be welcomed to it! And that takes hard decisions, and actions that are not always easy but they lead you in that way. I loved you and connected with you more than I'd probably had ever connected with anyone. but you are not good for me, you are currently not good for yourself stuck in a Neverending toxic situation. So therefore to try and once again find happiness in this life I must remove myself from you no matter how much it rips me up to do it üòîüòîüòî. I know you claim to be moving on from him and claim to give me the world.... but there is nothing from you I longer want other than Space, and your own pursuit of happiness. Bye my guerra, my love, my baby and once upon a time absolute best friend.

I don‚Äôt really know where to start ,for the last 6 months I have been feeling like shit , you know depression ,anxiety ,loneliness, anger and plain sadness all stacked up at the same time, to make things clearer  i have been struggling with loneliness for a while i mean besides work all i do is sit in my god damn room browsing insta or reddit all day long because i simply have nothing to do , the thing is i do have a couple of  friends though but besides going to the same damn coffee house each time they don,t want to do anything else and its making me frustrated and hate being around them because to be honest i still feel alone around them and bored ,and im so tired of living the same day and the same routine each and everytime ,and i don‚Äôt get invited anywhere by anyone else ,i‚Äôve always been invisible to other people which is making me feel even more alone .


Now what made this even worse is me having a huge crush on this girl from work ,and talking to her is the only exciting thing going on in my life and the only thing thats making me happy  but knowing how fucked my mental state at the moment is i couldn‚Äôt make a move and ask her out because  also guess what , i have severe anxiety and low self esteem and never been in a relationship in my life (im 24 btw  and im terrified of asking her out because i know i cant function when im anxious but i know i ll regret it for the rest of my life  ) which thinking about it is making me despise myself even more and despise how helpless and such a loser i‚Äôam which is making my depression also worse . 


Now to add to all of this my eyesight is getting worse because i have been diagnosed with  keratoconus so now there‚Äôs also the stress and fear of my vision deteriorating even more then it already has (ps : due to keratoconus i also can‚Äôt drive at night which is definitely not helping with my whole dating and crush situation lol) , you think this is over? No its not ive also been having family issues which i don‚Äôt want to get into details with but they re making shit worse for sure .


All of this together is really having its toll on me and i‚Äôm just tired , i‚Äôm also an engineering student besides working as a software dev so add in the stress from work and exams and everything and its a recipe for a disaster ,i‚Äôm literally on the verge of a mental breakdown and I don‚Äôt know how the hell i‚Äôm supposed to keep going
I dont know what kind of advice im looking for honestly so i‚Äôll consider everything , i just wanted to let all this out somewhere and to someone so here it is :‚Äô) and thanks",1,1730832219.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

[$1000],"TLDR: Total beginner, got the Ninja Luxe, super happy with beginner friendliness, was able to pull some great shots, but getting irritated with inconsistency. Is there something significantly better in less than $1K?

Hi, I'm a beginner with home brewing. Favorite drink is macchiato (not the Starbucks monstrosity) at cafes.

Was looking into Barrista Express Pro deals (faster prep time than Barrista Express) initially but open to other options with a similar total budget. Saw the Ninja reviews and got it instead.

The great part with Ninja: it's super beginner friendly. It made it super easy to dial in the coffee for the first time. Have been enjoying espresso / macchiato / cortado at home daily for the last couple of weeks. The price is great for the options and quality. Already making better shots (to my taste) than the cafe I love (with the same beans from that cafe) a good number of times. The auto-frothing is great for my goals -- and I didn't even feel the need to try manual frothing yet. Generally the design is so awesome and I'm a User Experience geek.

The bad: The consistency of espresso shots is lacking. I've had one ""perfect"" and a few ""great"" shots to my taste but not able to repeat the same thing at the same settings. I'm a little OCD in general about this sorta stuff. So I'm considering returning while still in the return window.

The questions: Can high consistency with high quality be achieved under $1K? What setup would you recommend for that? Is it possible that the beans have degraded having been sitting in the grinder? Am I just being too picky for my budget?",1,1730831942.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

Any advice?","Throw away account because the post kept getting deleted on my main.  
  
So, I (24M) met this amazing girl (27F) while browsing at the library. We instantly clicked‚Äîlike, really clicked. We got coffee, swapped book recommendations, and even found out we shared the same sense of humor and love for obscure indie games. For the first six months, we talked for hours every single day. She‚Äôd text me first thing in the morning, and we‚Äôd stay in touch all day. Honestly, I hadn‚Äôt felt this kind of connection with anyone in a long time. It was refreshing, and I felt like I‚Äôd found a kindred spirit.

Then, around the six-month mark, something changed. She started getting more distant. At first, it was just her replies taking longer‚Äîshe‚Äôd go from responding in minutes to taking hours, then eventually whole days. When I‚Äôd ask to hang out, she‚Äôd be too busy or say she‚Äôd rather stay in, which was fine because we‚Äôre both homebodies. But the lack of communication started to really bother me. I missed our daily chats and felt a weird sense of anxiety waiting for her replies, which often came hours later only for her to say she was going to bed or too tired to talk. I tried hinting that I missed our friendship being closer, but‚Ä¶well, she didn‚Äôt get the hints, and I ended up just feeling more frustrated.

At one point, I found out she‚Äôd gotten herself a new gaming PC‚Äîit was expensive, high-end, and honestly kinda ass (a 4070 Super with a $150 motherboard). I was so annoyed because building gaming PCs is my thing; I‚Äôve built them for all my friends, so it stung that she didn‚Äôt even think to ask me. She even started playing some of the multiplayer games I‚Äôd been begging us to try together, but alone. I know it was unfair since I didn‚Äôt properly tell her how I was feeling, but I ended up feeling pretty resentful. I ended up snapping a bit, telling her it felt like she didn‚Äôt care about our friendship anymore, and asking her directly if our friendship had run its course.

Her response was surprising and a bit of a reality check. She told me that she‚Äôd probably been a bit¬†too¬†invested in our friendship early on‚Äîshe said she‚Äôd been ‚Äúeuphoric‚Äù about our connection and had maybe even gotten a little obsessed. But by nature, she just doesn‚Äôt tend to keep up intense communication with anyone for long. She assured me that she still valued me as a friend but just couldn‚Äôt pay as much attention to me as before.

Hearing that stung, but I told her I understood and tried to back off. Since then, we‚Äôve settled into more casual contact. We only catch up a few times a month and have gone out for milkshakes twice. In my heart she‚Äôs no longer my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù but still a friend I love dearly, if that makes sense.

Looking back, I‚Äôll admit I was probably a bit obsessed, too. When she started pulling away, it left me in a pretty bad place because I hadn‚Äôt really adjusted.

But here‚Äôs the twist: now¬†she‚Äôs¬†acting like¬†I¬†was before. Suddenly, she‚Äôs messaging me all the time, asking why I take so long to respond, wanting to meet up constantly, and getting pouty when I can‚Äôt chat for hours. It‚Äôs like our roles have completely reversed. She suddenly wants to chat all day, and here I am, barely able to keep up because I‚Äôve gotten used to her being distant and have other things going on.

So‚Ä¶WTF do I do? I feel bad ignoring her, but I don‚Äôt want to fall back into that pattern of constant contact, especially since I‚Äôve moved on a bit. Do I talk to her about it, or just let things settle naturally? Any advice would be awesome.

TL;DR:¬†My close friend got distant after six months of constant contact, so I moved on. Now it‚Äôs like our roles have reversed, and I‚Äôm not in the same place anymore. I just don‚Äôt think I can handle it.",0,1730831940.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

I thought my carpets were just *stuck* with certain stains. Nope. This stuff is straight-up serious about cleaning.

**First Off, the Smell:** You know when you step into a place, and it just *smells* clean? Like, not trying too hard with heavy perfume vibes, but just fresh? That‚Äôs the scent with this solution. My place instantly smells like someone deep-cleaned it top to bottom, but without any of those weird chemical scents. It‚Äôs just fresh ‚Äì like, open-the-windows-on-a-nice-day kinda vibe.

**The Cleaning Power:** Alright, here‚Äôs where it shines. I used this with my BISSELL ProHeat 2X Revolution (a true power couple), and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to see *this* level of clean. I‚Äôm talking old pet stains, coffee, random ‚ÄúI-don‚Äôt-even-know-what-that-was‚Äù spots‚Ä¶ GONE. This is like power-wash-in-a-bottle kind of clean. It somehow pulls out stuff you didn‚Äôt even know was in the carpet. Makes you wonder what you‚Äôve been stepping on all this time.

**Easy to Use:** No wild science experiment here ‚Äì just add it to your carpet cleaner, mix it up with some hot water, and you‚Äôre good. It‚Äôs got this low-foaming formula, which means it doesn‚Äôt bubble up all crazy, but don‚Äôt let that fool you. It‚Äôs doing the heavy lifting. Just fill, click, and roll.

**Value for Money:** Okay, I know some people will say, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it just carpet cleaner?‚Äù But nah ‚Äì this is like the ‚Äúone that got away‚Äù if you don‚Äôt try it. A little goes a long way, so you‚Äôre getting solid mileage out of the bottle, especially for a pro-grade cleaner. You‚Äôll use less, get better results, and avoid calling in those overpriced pros. For real, it‚Äôs an investment in *not* having grimy floors.

**The Downsides?** If I have to nitpick, it‚Äôs that once you start seeing what this stuff does, you‚Äôre gonna wanna clean everything. And, yeah, it might set the bar a little too high for other cleaners you‚Äôve used. So if you‚Äôre not ready to make every other cleaner in your cabinet feel like they‚Äôve been slacking‚Ä¶ well, you‚Äôve been warned!

**Final Thoughts:** If your carpets are crying for help, get this. It‚Äôs like hitting the reset button, but on your floors. Feels like you‚Äôve got brand-new carpet in the spot where your dog used to roll around. And that, my friends, is worth every penny!",1,1730831854.0,SetupReviews,0,1.0,False
1gkdrng,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gkdrng/a_funny_story_by_chatgpt/,A funny story by ChatGPT,"
My wife has a thing for hobbies. Once in a while she finds a new one, and goes all in on it. I was dreaming how funny  it would be if there was a AA for people with hobbies. An AH. So I asked ChatGPT the following:

‚ÄúWrite a funny story about the AH, a self-help support group for women who are members of the Anonymous Hobbyists. The hobbyist equivalent of AA, Alcoholics Anonymous.‚Äù

The Funny thing is that AH is also the name of one of the largest grocery stores in the Netherlands, also called Albert Heijn, and I think ChatGPT must have thought I was referring to that, instead of to Anonymous Hobbyists. But it really adds to the fun.

#Story

On Tuesday nights, in a small conference room above the local Albert Heijn ‚Äì squeezed between the storage room and the employee coffee corner ‚Äì a group gathers: the Anonymous Hobbyists (AH). The name sometimes causes confusion, and now and then someone joins, thinking they‚Äôre signing up for an AH customer feedback panel. But as soon as the first woman stands up to share her story, it becomes clear: this is not a place for loyalty cards or shopping stamps.

The group is made up of women who have become hopelessly addicted to a wide range of hobbies. Leading the circle is Truus, the self-appointed ""Hobby Sponsor."" Truus is a former knitting addict who claims she‚Äôs been ‚Äúclean‚Äù for five months now, after developing a new obsession with wood carving. She looks sternly around the room and says, ‚ÄúWelcome, ladies. We‚Äôre here to support each other and stay strong. It‚Äôs no shame to have a hobby‚Ä¶ unless your living room looks like the Action after Black Friday.‚Äù

#Sharing Circle:

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Annie,‚Äù begins the first woman, a little nervously. The group responds in unison, ‚ÄúHi Annie!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it all started so innocently. I just wanted to make one little jar of homemade jam, like that one food blogger‚Ä¶ But then the lockdown hit, and well‚Ä¶ suddenly, I had 214 jars. The basement is full, the shed is full, and yesterday I found out my husband had removed all the screws from the kitchen drawers because he couldn‚Äôt find space for his tools anymore.‚Äù

Truus nods sympathetically. ""Making jam can be deceptive, Annie. Before you know it, you‚Äôre making more jars than you have friends to give them to.""

Then Mieke stands up. She‚Äôs wearing a t-shirt that says ‚ÄúCards Are My Life‚Äù and pulls a little box of tissues out of her bag. ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Mieke,‚Äù she says. The group greets her.

‚ÄúIt started with Christmas cards‚Ä¶ I just wanted to make a few for fun. But‚Ä¶ then I discovered scrapbooking, ladies‚Ä¶ the glitter, the cutting, the gluing. At first, it was cards, then albums, and now‚Ä¶‚Äù She starts to cry. ‚ÄúNow I have a room full of card supplies, 17 albums filled with photos of other people‚Äôs dogs, and a glitter carpet that I‚Äôll never get out!‚Äù

The group nods in understanding. ""Buy glitter in bulk, and you‚Äôre doomed,"" sighs Truus.

Finally, it‚Äôs Linda‚Äôs turn. ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Linda, and I‚Ä¶ I just wanted one bonsai tree as a hobby. It seemed like such a nice project, caring for a little miniature tree. But now‚Ä¶‚Äù She takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúNow I have a sunroom filled with bonsai trees, some of which are in better shape than my own children! My husband even bought a hedge trimmer last month because he thought we had a jungle in the living room‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good you‚Äôre here, Linda,‚Äù says Truus kindly. ‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs hard to shop anywhere without stumbling on a new hobby. Albert Heijn is no help. Who really needs *genuine* ingredients for sourdough bread? Nobody! But they always display those baking kits right up front!‚Äù

The group nods in agreement again. They all know that you never leave Albert Heijn without finding a new hobby. Even at the checkout, the cashier might lean over and whisper, ‚ÄúWe just got in new watercolor sets.‚Äù

At the end of the night, they hug each other goodbye. Truus offers one last piece of wisdom: ‚ÄúRemember, ladies, the only true necessity is a loyalty card‚Ä¶ and maybe just one hobby. But definitely no more than one. Although‚Ä¶ that yoga mat on sale is tempting.‚Äù

Everyone leaves the AH with a bit more willpower, though if you look closely, you might still spot a few with a crafting kit under their arm or a bonsai tree tucked behind their groceries.",2,1730831750.0,ChatGPT,1,0.75,False

I‚Äôm coming out of a year-long relationship and am looking to level up my dating life. I‚Äôd love to meet someone without lowering my standards just to keep options open. My goal is to put myself out there, leverage my assets, and attract the right people. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown about me:

**My Strengths**

	‚Ä¢	Height: I‚Äôm 6‚Äô7‚Äù (and yes, I literally bump into doorframes!).

	‚Ä¢	Fitness: I‚Äôm in good shape‚Äîwork out 5x a week, and it shows.

	‚Ä¢	Success: I run my own businesses, live independently, and am financially stable.

	‚Ä¢	Lifestyle: I‚Äôve got my life together‚Äîsolid friends, my own place, a car, hobbies (I ride horses, go to the gym, photography, travel and much more).

**My Challenges**

	‚Ä¢	Sober Lifestyle: I don‚Äôt drink alcohol or coffee, which limits some social options.

	‚Ä¢	Connecting Outside of Work: I‚Äôm solid in a professional setting but struggle with socializing and approaching people.

	‚Ä¢	Gold Diggers: I want genuine connections and am cautious about those attracted solely to financial stability.

	‚Ä¢	Cold Leads: Approaching people cold (especially in places like the gym) is intimidating, and I‚Äôm unsure of the best way to handle it.



Where Do I Start?



I‚Äôm not really into the club scene (especially sober), and I‚Äôm unsure about approaches at the gym‚Äîopinions seem mixed on that. For those who‚Äôve been in a similar boat, where did you find the most success meeting new people? Any tips on improving social confidence or refining my approach?

It's really helped me on my break up journey and in my time of grief. So my ex (25F) and me (25M) met on Tinder back in 2019, in Portsmouth. This was during the first month of my third year at university and she was doing a work placement year in the psychology department. 

It was a bumpy start as I wasn't sure I wanted to jump into a relationship yet so we stayed friends for a month. I then saw how well she got on with my friends and how much I loved spending time with her, that it would have been silly not to try! 

So we did, we also ended up living together fairly early because of covid in 2020, so it gave us a great insight on how that dynamic would pan out and it worked! There really were very little issues and we just jelled so well. 

A bit further on, she had to go back to Cardiff for her third year and she lived with some friends and I stayed in Portsmouth and worked as a supermarket assistant for about a year until her third year was over. Covid was still an issue so our relationship became mostly video calls and watching films online together. It was tough but we pulled through!

So this takes us to summer 2021. We found a really nice flat and we moved in! It was great, I got a job as a bartender and she worked as a dog groomer/stylist. Everything was fine, we got better jobs and we moved to another rented accommodation. 

After all this, about 5 months ago, roughly, she wanted to buy a house with me. It was the logical next step. I thought, 'Sure!' I was a little concerned as this was only my second relationship, really, it was my first proper one, but I loved her so much that it didn't matter. I knew I wanted to do make this commitment. 

The process was pretty easy, we were stressed about all the paper work and legal things but we managed to get through it all. I was really excited to be with her in this house, but I felt like I wasn't that excited about the home and more so my continued life with her. I had also asker her dad if I could marry her. 

\*Quick filler, she struggled with Anxiety and was on medication for it. She also was likely autistic but never got it confirmed. It never caused many issues and I was always happy to help her when she got panicked.\* 

Anyway, she was a horse rider, that was her hobby whereas mine was gaming/gym. She had joined a hunt group (not actual hunting, it's faked with smells etc) she seemed to really love it and I was happy for her. Eventually she went on a night out with them and met a guy (21M), who was related to one of the people in this group. She told me about the night and had always been pretty transparent with me if she felt she needed to be. Nothing happened and I didn't think anything of it. 

A week later they were texting, I felt a little weird about it but it was just texting and I didn't want to be controlling. A few more weeks, and it's everyday. He had asked her out for coffee and I said to her that it's her choice but I would be really uncomfortable about it. I also found out that before coffee he had asked if she wanted to go stargazing which was even weirder.

She respected my feelings and didn't meet him one on one, but I knew he'd be at other socials and things with this group. 

Further forward, this party was coming up, that he would be at and I was at a friend's birthday in London. I didn't like it but she asked me and I didn't want to control her. It's her life, if she catches feelings then I just leave, but deep down of course I was scared. 

Weekend happens and I find out a few of the people went back to his and stayed there, including her. She was on the sofa and I believe her when she says this. However something did happen... 

I called her the next day and we had a bit of a debate over the phone and I expressed how uncomfortable the whole thing made me, she had also gone for lunch with the family as they had asked the night before. It was just all very weird to me, and sudden. 

I was at my parents after the London party, as I went there every 2 weeks for work as I worked between Cardiff and London. Normally I drove back to Cardiff on Wednesday but we had a call on Monday and she was in pieces. She was questioning our relationship and buying the house etc. I felt like it was the new guy friend stuff, the house and it was all a lot for both of us. So I asked if she would feel better if I came home, and that calmed her down. So I went into work on Tuesday and asked to leave that day instead of Wednesday and they said yes (legends!) 

So I went home and she was kissing me, hugging me and of course we did what couples do when you miss each other.. fill in the gaps yourselves. We then had a decent evening, I was still stressed as we were so close to a breakup the night before so I asked her a few questions to which she seemed fine. However she did seem off, like something had changed in her mind already... and it had. 

We went to bed and slept for about 2 hours, until I woke up to her leaving the bed. She said she wanted to go downstairs and read or draw. She couldn't sleep. I knew something was up, she would normally do this in bed with me, she never needed to go downstairs. So I got up and asked what the matter was, was she still stressed about us or the house etc? She then went silent and I said, 'There's something you aren't telling me isn't there?' 

She sat quietly until eventually telling me that the guy from the party had expressed his feelings (he knew about us and the house) and how much he liked her. She said he held her hand and that she had admitted feelings as well. 

At this point I felt pain but also relief as I knew this guy liked her all month but she kept telling me ""He isn't like that, he's just a friend.' Stupidly, I tried to salvage it and said, it's the house stress and that we should still try and do this. That's when she says, ""Well I've already fucked it up now."" ""He kissed me and I kissed him back."" That moment, will echo in my mind forever.

Throughout our entire relationship we had casual conversations about this. We always agreed we would tell each other if the love went or we started feeling something for someone else that we would break it amicably. She broke the biggest morale I thought we both shared. Also she didn't show any signs of falling out of love for me until the week after she had kissed the guy. Even when we had our last conversation, once I had packed all my shit up, she told me she still loves me and hopes she hasn't made the wrong choice. 

I am aware that if she was to come back that it's an unfixable situation and I should write her off forever but I feel a little bit of me holds on because, how could you throw away 5 years of what we had for a month of texting. I realise it's the honey moon feeling, it's someone new, he is more attractive for her both physically and emotionally. Also the house stress did it as well. 

Anyway, I had to move to my parents home and setup there and I'm financially quite strong. I've hired a PT and I'm going to get really into my fitness. I want to meet new people (I'm on apps and have chatted to some) but I realise it's really early and that could be damaging. 

We both still talk on WhatsApp as we had two cats and have taken one each. Also house and financial stuff needs to be worked out. I just want to say that the tunnel vision is scary and if anyone else going through this right now wants to reach out, I'm happy to chat and go through this together.

1gkdnrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1gkdnrj/first_colposcopy_experience_sorta_positive_cin_2/,First Colposcopy Experience - sorta positive - CIN 2,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my first colposcopy experience for anyone who is anxious and freaking out (like I was). Reading posts on here really helped me (and some of them scared the shit out of me); of course everyone's experiences and bodies are different, but I wanted to add. This is what mine was like:

**4 months ago:** routine pap shows HPV positive (not 16/18) with no abnormalities. Because I'd had a positive HPV test in the past, my gyno offered to do a colposcopy, but said I didn't really need one and I could just come back for a pap next year. I have been feeling 'off' down there for the past \~1.5 years, so I decided to get the colposcopy. 

**2 months ago:** Day of colposcopy. I'm freaking tf out. My IUD insertion 5 years ago was TERRIBLE; I passed out and threw up. So I was extremely nervous for this medical procedure. About an hour before, I ate lunch and took 800 mg of Ibuprofen with one of my prescribed anti anxiety pills.  

**In the exam room:** My blood pressure was taken and the nurse said it was extremely high; I explained that I was really nervous. She gave up trying to get a good reading lol. I strip from the waist down and sit on the table. My Gyno comes in and, knowing I'm nervous, says ""We don't \*have\* to do this you know!"" but I was already there and just wanted to get it over with. 

I get in the stirrups and she inserts the speculum. This was honestly the most painful part for me, it was a bigger one than usual because she needs to see in there super well. Once that was in, the pain went away, and I was more just uncomfortable.

Then she applies the vinegar solution. Getting my cervix touched doesn't feel great but it doesn't hurt. She says that she sees maybe one area that looks like some CIN. Then she applies the iodine solution, again it doesn't hurt but feels weird. Once the iodine solution was on she said she sees two areas that look like possible CIN, so she is going to take two biopsies. She said my cervical transformation zone was visible, and that she doesn't need to do an ECC today. 

**The biopsies:** She walked me through the whole procedure and told me when she was going to take one. She counted up from one, and took the first biopsy on three. I focused on deep breathing and felt nothing! Not even a cramp. She then went back in for the second biopsy, again counting up from one. During the actual biopsy I felt nothing, but a few seconds later I began to cramp lightly. It didn't feel great, especially with my coochie wide open to the world, but I focused on breathing and it went away within 15 seconds.  She then applied monsels solution and that was it!

**Afterwards:** I rested the rest of the day, and felt more emotionally drained than physically drained. I didn't expect this whole thing to take such an emotional toll on me, but honestly, I've been anxious and depressed about the whole ordeal.  Over the next few days I had weird brownish discharge that smelt very metallic. No coffee ground chunks. The smell went away after about a week; my period was 1.5 weeks late and I had much stronger cramping than usual with this period. 

**Results:** About two weeks later I got the results: CIN 2, which was first marked as CIN 2/3. This was super devastating to me, and its taken me a while to process this. My Gyno was very surprised, since I've only ever had normal pap tests. I'm scheduled for a second colposcopy in 6 months from now, where she will do an ECC + more samples.

**TLDR:** *My colposcopy wasn't as bad as I was anticipating; it is more the emotional toll of finding out about CIN 2 that has been hard. I recommend taking otc pain meds and eating before hand. Deep breathing during the whole thing helped me a lot. If you're reading this before your colposcopy, you've got this! Sending hugs.*

**Lifestyle Changes:** I also wanted to share the lifestyle changes I'm making for these 6 months so that hopefully my CIN is in remission/HPV gone for my next check-up.  I'm \*\*\*NOT\*\*\* a doctor, please do your own research and consult your doctor. This may have no effect on CIN/HPV, but I want to do anything I can to try and avoid a LEEP. Based on this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/1aqdxx4/how\_i\_cleared\_cin2\_and\_hpv\_on\_my\_own\_in\_3\_months/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/1aqdxx4/how_i_cleared_cin2_and_hpv_on_my_own_in_3_months/)  
1. Strict condom usage with partner. I have a long-term parter + IUD, so we never used condoms. In the event that they also has HPV and we are re-infecting each other, I want to prevent that as much as possible. Unfortunately, I'm also decreasing the amount of sex we have in general for now. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4068337/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4068337/)  
2. Getting the Gardasil 9 vaccine. Both my partner and I will get this vaccine; they never had it at all, and I only had the Gardasil 4 when I was younger. [https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2016/08/hpv-vaccine-boosts-immune-memory.html](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2016/08/hpv-vaccine-boosts-immune-memory.html)   
3. Taking a daily multivitamin that has vitamins A, C, D, K, B6 and B12, plus green tea leaf extract (EGCG), plus a bunch of other things. I got a really nice multivitamin that was $$ but I think that is worth it for the amount of vitamins + bioavailability of the higher grade nutrients. I also take Hyaluronic acid daily now. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10051187/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10051187/)  
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11204999/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11204999/)  
4. No smoking anymore. I used to vape at least once a week, and I have stopped this completely. [https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/167/2/408/5112971](https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/167/2/408/5112971)  
5. No alcohol - I'm going completely sober for these 6 months. [https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/10/8/899/162045/Alcoholism-and-Risk-for-Cancer-of-the-Cervix-Uteri](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/10/8/899/162045/Alcoholism-and-Risk-for-Cancer-of-the-Cervix-Uteri)  
6. Overall healthier diet: I'm focusing on eating more fruit and vegetables and less processed sugar. I now eat a high-quality breakfast every morning before coffee (I try to get as much protein in as possible), and am swapping out ice cream with greek yogurt + honey, etc. I also stopped drinking energy drinks and try to only have 1 cup of coffee a day (as opposed to my usual 2 coffee + Monster lol)

7. Exercise and sleep: I am consistently working out at least 2xs a week but usually 4xs, with a mix of cardio, weight training, and pilates. I also am prioritizing my sleep and am getting at least 8 hours every night (but usually 10 hours).   
8. Stress management: I put A LOT of effort into my job, to the point where I think it is hurting my overall health and well-being. I'm prioritizing myself this year, through these changes and by not overworking, starting therapy, and investing more in my friends and family <3 

Even if none of this works, I think I really needed a lifestyle change. I hope that at the very least my immune system is strengthened by these changes. Best of luck to all of you on this sub - your posts and comments have really helped me through this diagnosis and I'm wishing the best for all of us :)

Books 2 and 3 will be in the works, though they're available now in other formats.

The blurb: 

>**Finding the balance between good and evil is about to require a lot of coffee.**

>What‚Äôs better than being a college dropout twenty-something working as a barista in New Haven, CT? Just about anything.

>Nick would give anything to escape the dead-end life he‚Äôs made for himself. He gets the offer of a lifetime from Lucifer himself, to trade his apron for a suit. Should he really consider becoming an agent of the Devil? With the way things are going for Nick, of course he should.

>Lucifer wants to give Nick a chance to do what he always wanted, to help people, wielding power and influence to make their dreams come true. He would have to sell his soul, but the Devil is a gambling man and lets Nick experience his new life before he has to sign on the dotted line. Can he use the Devil‚Äôs power for good, and make his mark on the world, or will he fall victim to his own desires and lose his humanity?

>As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the very friend that made the meeting with Lucifer possible turns on Nick, and he needs to do some quick thinking to come out on top. Maybe the ends justify the means, but there are no easy answers.

The ability to take risky degenerate loans against your assets and make risky degenerate decisions makes gambling at the casino look like child‚Äôs play. 

10x 200x 2000x leverage this is your next store neighbors definition of a morning coffee high. If your next store neighbor is a total nerd and is desperate for that lotto win.

As for the less risk adverse and sort of smart people throwing your ALPH to be loaned out is making money while sitting on your butt with the Netflix remote in hand. This is actually unlimited pizzas depending on how much you ‚Äústake‚Äù offload to be loaned out. 

Anyways, I‚Äôll be on the lookout for that.

Still thinking the bull run and its peak is somewhere around November 2025 and to be fair I‚Äôll probably offload it all too soon and miss out on the wick to $25 before it all comes crashing down and the next run begins towards early 2028. 

Don‚Äôt overthink this. People are getting ready to have access to liquidity and you don‚Äôt wanna be there scapegoat. This isn‚Äôt advice to sell this is more a statement saying anything beyond that and you set yourself up for another 4 years of bear market which in crypto is an eternity of hopium highs and hair pulling symptoms, but ya know in yield position like ALPHbanx that could be just what you need to survive it and make money.

I met this girl in college recently‚Äîwe've been in a few classes together, and we‚Äôve had some nice conversations about school and life.

I feel like my scars hold me back in ways that I hate admitting, especially when it comes to relationships. I keep wishing that I could feel more comfortable, that my skin wouldn‚Äôt always be in the back of my mind.

Feeling very defeated today and most days lately. I am a stay at home of one amazing and happy 1.5 year old boy. I wanted nothing more in my early thirties than to be a mama so when my fianc√© proposed we skipped the wedding and went right to baby making. I got pregnant at 33 and had our son right after I turned 34.

The first year was incredibly challenging. I had postpartum anxiety and depression, most likely caused by sleep deprivation and hormone imbalances. I had to go back to work after 6 months because we just couldn‚Äôt afford to live on one income. I taught preschool with my son in class with me. This was very challenging for obvious reasons. 

At about a year things began to get easier as my son became more independent and began sleeping through the night. We also sold our city house and moved out to the country. Built our dream tiny home and now I am a stay at home mom again. 

My partner has always been very supportive. When we lived in the city I had Monday, Wednesday, and sometimes Friday evenings to go to the gym or yoga when he got home. Girls nights whenever I wanted and all the me time I could fit on the calendar. He also took night wakings to bottle feed when my mental health began to deteriorate even though I was breast feeding almost exclusively.  Now that we are homesteading and building if he is not at work he is working on our home. So more ‚Äúme‚Äù time is not always an option. 

Fast forward to my son being 18 months old now. He is incredibly smart, mobile, eats well, and loves to read. With that being said he is also an absolute terror. He is very physical and gets into everything. He does not listen at all to what you tell him and usually does the exact opposite. He used to sleep independently and now wakes up multiple times a night wanting to get in our bed. I am sleep deprived again and losing my mind. 

I am in therapy right now trying to get control of my emotions but I just lose it sometimes. This morning he woke up at 6:30am, as I was trying to get up, have coffee, and read before we start our day. He started breaking down around 9:30 ( usually naps at noon) and he just cried and screamed all morning. Wouldn‚Äôt eat, didn‚Äôt want a cuddle, just blind with rage. I eventually also lost it as well..crying and screaming.

It absolutely breaks my heart that I cannot regulate my own nervous system. Could PPA really last almost two years? Why do I not love being a mama like I thought I would? All I wanted to do was stay home with my babies, cook, and take care of the house but now that I am here it‚Äôs just so hard. 

Someone please tell me it gets easier.",4,1730831076.0,Mommit,2,0.84,False
1gkdhd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gkdhd2/aitah_for_pointing_out_everything_my_husband_does/,AITAH for pointing out everything my husband does wrong üôà,"So I can't believe I'm doing this but AITAH readings are one my favorite podcasts. So I figured this is going to be the best place to get unbiased opinions. 

Back story, my husband and I have been together 10 years. Married for almost 4 years and then divorced. We remarried 5 months after our divorce. Long story short, we've been through a lot. Both experienced trauma before and during our relationship. The marriage we have now is a million times better than the relationship we had previously. We've both done a lot of work on ourselves to heal and grow as individuals and as a couple. (Some more than others but I'm choosing to believe that's neither here nor there.)

For more context, for the most part, he's always worked outside the home. Typical 9-5 hours more or less. And since 2018, I've worked from home. What I do allows me to work around my children so for the last 3 years, I've also homeschooled 4 out of our 5 children. 1 (15) still goes to public school. And the oldest (17) doesn't need my assistance with her school. The others are younger. 5, 8, and 11. So my days are spent doing work calls, helping the children with their school, cooking, cleaning, caring for the animals, etc. 

My husband is a clean person but tends to also be very messy. I'm very OCD (I have tourette syndrome so autism, adhd, and other comorbidies that go along with it. I've worked very hard to learn how to recognize when I'm overstimulated and also how to emotionally regulate myself so I'm able to also help my children better learn/teach themselves as well. As well as help my husband.) All of that being said, there have been some issues over the last few months that have caused some arguments that didn't go well. Certain behaviors and disrespect came to surface because that's something my husband has always done (gotten better) and hasn't figured out how stop. (To me, it's a choice because I've done my inner work and figured out how to control myself. Which wasn't/isn't easy figuring out in your 30s. I'm 35 and he's 42) The issues weren't about him being messy. They're other issues I could elaborate on if needed but basically isolated issues where there wasn't much resolve and left room for resentment. He prefers to wake up the next morning and move on where as I'd prefer to talk things out, feel heard and understood, and issues not continue to repeat themselves. Not meaning same isolated instances, but same behaviors when issues arise. I'm at the point where it seems obvious he's going to continue doing what he says he'll stop doing. Like lashing out, being super disrespectful, getting aggressive, saying mean/hurtful/untrue things, etc.

Moving on to why I'm asking AITAH. I do majority of the cleaning and all of the cooking. As well as shopping and making sure everyone has everything they need plus I handle all doctors appointments, bill paying, children's school, etc. Over the years I've implemented certain ways to keep our home organized. We are a family of 7 in a 1500sqft home. Ideally, in my opinion, everything in our home (if possible) should have a home. For example, towels go on a certain shelf, Tupperware bowls go in a certain cabinet, medicine in a particular bin, so on and so forth. And with dishes, they get rinsed off and put in the right side of the sink, dirty towels go in a specific place in the laundry room, for our children's laundry each draw and closet has certain clothes that go in each. (Shorts in one, pants another, socks and underwear, shirts hung up) I could go on and on but hopefully you get my point. My husband, however, would just put anything, anywhere. Socks, shorts, shirts, underwear would go in any drawer they could fit. Wet towels in our clothes hamper. Pots and pans in the Tupperware cabinet. Dishes left in either side of the sink, not rinsed off. He'll leave he's loofah and body wash on our shower floor, toothbrush, paste, and razor left on the counter vs the designated container right next to them. Our garage has stuff all over the place and aside from cleaning, I've given up trying to keep it organized and just avoid going out there. I recently deep cleaned out shed because it was an absolute disaster and couldn't even step into it. I got rid of so much old and unusable junk/trash, deep cleaned, and organized it. I found he had mowed and put the lawnmower back in there without emptying the bag and had to clean that out which was 10x harder had it been dumped the day he mowed. It was so packed and half wet in the middle, half dry on the outside I had to dig all the grass out by hand. I'm constantly picking up after him every day. His dirty laundry on the floor, his old coffee pod next to the kurig, random stuff left on the kitchen counter. Over the years I would point things out or ask him to do things differently and he would temporarily. Lately I've been trying to instill better habits in our 2 youngest sons (5&8). Like explaining to them our table and counters aren't trash cans and they need to be cleaning up after themselves. Their dirty laundry goes in the hamper. Their shoes have a home and it isn't the middle of the living room or kitchen floor. Yanno, normal parenting. But with my husband, I had stopped ""nagging"". With the way things have gone the last few months and very recently, I've felt my filter doesn't want to filter and I find myself pointing out every little thing. Last night, he took my bowl for me after I was done eating. I appreciated it very much until I found it in the sink this morning, half filled with water, half leftover food debris with other dishes in said gross water. So I just blatantly asked, ""is this the bowel you took from me last night to be helpful? Doesn't look very helpful to me."" On top of pointing out his coffee pod, his crumbs on the counter and floor. All just today. There have been other comments I've said over the last couple of days and I can tell it's bothering him and I'm sure he'll tell me I'm in the wrong soon enough. I feel like I ATAH because usually I just ignore it, do what I have to do, and focus on his positives. I promise there's a long list of them. So AITAH? Am I wrong for letting resentment change the way I normally react? Our most recent argument was me trying to talk to him about how overwhelmed I am and that turned into him lashing out at me and telling me I was pointing the finger at him and telling he doesn't do enough. üòë

 If anyone has experience using these filters with the Aiden for larger brews, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks so much for your help!",2,1730831065.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False

This is my first project- I'm attempting to make a live edge desk. I bought this slab off of FB marketplace as someone else's failed coffee table project. It was sealed in a thick lacquer and had heavy blade chatter marks all across the slab. After TONS of sanding I almost have it all cleaned. Can anyone help with identifying the species? In keeping with the recommended post here are my answers to the helpful Qs:

1. I included as many pictures as able. Any dark shiny spots are leftover lacquer that I have yet to remove.
2. I purchased the slab on the NJ Shore and I live in NYC. I'm not positive if the slab is from a local species or not.
3. I'm an amateur but I would describe the wood as heavy/dense. It's 48""x28"" and 58lbs
4. It does not dent easily and I would not be able to put a screw in without a pilot hole

As a bonus, I'm open to opinions on staining vs no stain :). Thank you all!

I was diagnosed with ADHD in my late 40s (am 53 now) and for the last couple years I've been taking meds for it (first Adderall, then switched to Vyvanse a couple months ago). I do believe I had ADHD as a child as well but was not diagnosed.

I started on HRT - 0.05 mg estradiol patch plus 100 mg progesterone capsules - three weeks ago. I continued having super sweaty hot flashes, in the mornings up until early afternoon. I also was experiencing increased anxiety. At the same time, I've been orienting at a new job as a nurse (I graduated nursing school in May). It's been a stressful time!

Yesterday I skipped my Vyvanse to see how things would go, and sure enough, I had waaaay fewer hot flashes (really only after I had my morning coffee) and my mind was so much calmer. I wasn't panicky at work and my energy level was good. I skipped it today as well and I feel fine. Minimal hot flashes.

Has anyone noticed HRT directly improving their ADHD symptoms?? My working theory is that the HRT has actually made a difference in that dept and the Vyvanse may not be necessary. I also know that stimulant meds can cause sweating, so that wasn't helping my vasomotor symptoms for sure.

I haven't travelled much around chennai (only a few areas), so I'm a bit new to the place as well.

We're planning to visit some beaches and some things in and around chennai, including:
1. Kovalam Beach for swimming
2. Mahabalipuram (although not sure what exactly to see)
3. Kalpakkam Beach and Paradise Beach maybe (I'm not sure if swimming is safe here)
4. Auroville

It seems to be a bit too beach heavy. I'd like to show them some forts or old architecture or temples and some places of interest. Any insights on what we could do? What are some must haves? We're going to be in chennai for a couple of days and we have 2 days for places around Chennai and pondicherry. 

Please feel free to include names of restaurants or tea or coffee places as well. Or what to avoid as tourist traps or unsafe spaces. 

Also what are no-no things? I've been living in Europe for the past 5 years, so I feel like I've grown used to things here. Of course no PDA. And proper bathing suits with shorts in case we're swimming.

The picture of girl was hot and she was short cute girl. I was interested in her but I didn't accepted her proposal because I thought it could be a fake account although we had talked on call and she showed her family pics but it is possible to create a good fake account. So I asked her for date and she agreed we went to a good cafe for a cup of coffee. I reached a Lil bit early and the resturant was of 2 floors she was waiting for me on 1st floor but I didn't recognised her and went on 2nd floor and asked her on call ""where are you"" she was angry so she yelled at me and i somehow managed her to come on 2nd floor. Till that point of time I was thinking it is a scam and girl won't come because she was way too cute and the way she yelled at me. The plot twist come now she was a short ugly dark skin girl with bad fashion sense and a bad smell but it isn't a problem. She was crazy, she compared every girl with her and proved how she is the queen of world. She literally compared a waitress to frog while she was cleaning table and at that time I got pissed I paid the bill and I left. Next day she tried to connect me but I said I hate you. 

I discussed this with mutual friend and he told me she isn't a good girl and she uses lots of filters on her photos to look good and the guys she dated all are in trauma and he also praised me that I did good thing.
