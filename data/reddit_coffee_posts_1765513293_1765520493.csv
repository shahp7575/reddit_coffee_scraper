Chocolate and cherry that I can actually taste. Curious if others have tried it and what their experience is. When I read flavor profiles, I can rarely taste the ""tobacco"" or ""passion fruit"" they are supposed to have, and I also rarely like fruity coffee, which is apparently the cool thing now.

Every time Atrioc is mentioned or featured at all in other content especially on serious platforms the entire comments section explodes with glizzy jokes and completely drowns any actual discussion of the topics they're on. 

You have to understand how cringe of a look as a community it is when Big A is finally getting some mainstream recognition for his coverage and attracting attention to important issues, but most likely the first interaction someone like a Newsom or Ezra Klein pod listener has with Big A is our indecipherable brainrotted zoomer humor, and not even original or funny stuff, just total spam glizzy glizzy coffee cow etc slop and literally nothing related to the video. 

I think it would reflect a lot better on Atrioc if we actually used those opportunities to integrate some community stuff tastefully while actually engaging with the issues! It honestly feels like it represents him as a political/economic communicator poorly. Not everyone is a chronically online twitch chatter, if we want him to continue to get cool opportunities we don't want to be obnoxious in every comments section of a video that mentions him in passing.

A language model

Like the Tower of Babel

How would we have built this

What is this

In our most recent technological acceleration

We have become

Nations of language

And now we’re running up against the unknown

Our bones 

Beliefs we once held have been blown

Imagine

Whatever we were made to accomplish

We want this

If we try and get a feel for the hopeless

Connecting the suffering

We can open up our minds and always find bliss

Should I kill myself

Or should I have a cup of coffee

Invent the violin

Or let the void swell up and fill me in

We are the music makers

And our responsibility will always be

To be the dreamers of dreams

It’s all we can do 

This

Create

Cave paintings

A human hand and where to land the killing blow

Wooly rhino

Gone for now but they might be back

Lost in the churn

It was mostly us who burned

The garden

And it’s time to grow

On the shoulders of giants

Black holes

The preservation of all information

Do I walk away for good?,"My (current ex) of almost 4 years is now trying to win me back after horribly discarding me. He broke up with me in August and we didn’t speak for 2 months. Things got rocky with us in June because he’s a gambling addict and he finally decided to get help and go to GA. Well it made him spiral all summer and he became addicted to Xanax which I didn’t know he was taking. It makes sense now looking back why he was so erratic and impulsive and up and left me because I kept holding him accountable for his actions. He had multiple breakdowns and left me saying he needed to focus on his recovery and do the work alone, I come to find out for 3-4 weeks before he left he was texting a girl from his past that I always had worries about. They also met up for coffee once during work hours he claims. Off the bat I consider this emotional cheating. 2 days after he moved out he had sex with her. Said it happened twice. I saw in his Amazon cart that he bought her dog a toy during the last week of living with me.

It’s all bizarre. Maybe I sound dramatic and stupid since he “technically broke up with me “ and left but the betrayal hurts just as bad. There was also so many lies and details regarding this. The way he would scream at me that there was nobody else, he wants to be alone, then goes right to her. Like clearly he planned this out and manipulated me. He was downright so cold and mean to me those weeks wouldn’t look at me or talk he would just be on his phone constantly. 

Now he’s claiming it was a manic drug induced decision, needed a distraction and void bc he didn’t have gambling and was lying so much to me and couldn’t face me and handle the truth from me, so he left me but he didn’t actually want to, that I did nothing wrong and that she meant absolutely nothing to him.

I’m not buying it so easily. This girl has been an issue with us earlier on and in his last relationship with his ex gf too (confirmed this by speaking with her). TONS of trust issues regarding her. I think he realized this chick was just as bad so he ran back to me and is now begging for another chance. He’s seeing a psychologist and is off the drugs and in GA meetings 3 times a week. He wants to do couples therapy but I truly don’t feel like I need to do that with him any time soon unless I wanted to get back together. I’m doing my own and I feel like he needs to really do the work on himself.

I guess what I’m asking : do you think this is something I could overcome with therapy and time and worth rebuilding, or just move on and not look back? He seems genuine and remorseful but then again he’s always been a great liar. I just feel confused about the level of cheating but to me it was completely betraying ",1,1765520290.0,survivinginfidelity,1,1.0,False

I was 2/3 of the way through Project Hail Mary before I even noticed it was present tense), so I'm unwise in the learnings of this narrative. But I started writing a ficlet and it came out in present tense.

I think I was subconsciously copying other fics I'd read, so that got me thinking. Are short fics/ficlets more likely to be present tense? Is it easier to sustain over short distances? Because I have no idea where this present tense came from. I know it's usually kinda side-eyed but it felt... normal. Like maybe, yeah, in fanfic land, that's pretty accepted practice. Is it? Or should I switch it to past tense? (I know, write for yourself. But it's 1k words I dashed off. I'm not married to it. I'm more curious.)

-open to Costco , Tj suggestions as I have to make time somehow but Costco same problem as healthy tiffin..too much for one person.
-Bonus points for some variety in cuisines! 

 
I've recently gotten a second job and I'm out of home for 14ish hours most days now. I come home and heating up even microwave food feels like a task. Going to the grocery store to pick up food is another task I haven't achieved. Fairly new to this second job and I know energy levels will take sometime to get used to but I've been running on coffee and just extremely bad and non nutritional food (because It is so easy to reach in the bag of leftover Halloween candy 5 times a day) I am worried this is not just sustainable and the weight gain and health risks are even bigger of a concern. I know Fremont is a hub for Indian food and combos everywhere but as much as I promise myself I'll pick up food tomorrow, driving that extra 5 mins haven't been feeling worth it. I just wanna get home. I understand this is a me problem and self control and self discipline problem but right now with this lifestyle change, I can't work on it with all my force.

However, the coolant is completely clean and the level seems to be not dropped. You think that if this much coolant leaked into the oil, you would already notice the amount? The fluids also look clean when checking through the radiator cap (See the second picture) . Has anyone else encountered something similar? Could this still be due to condensation (driven short distances for the entire late summer/autumn in about 0°C) or some external moisture, or does this indicate something about the water pump/head gasket etc.? 
Is it in any way possible that the coolant side could stay completely clean while still leaking into the oil side? Which side has higher pressure: oil or coolant?

I’m currently doing an internship and there’s this guy in another department who’s also an intern. We’ve never had a proper conversation, but there have been SO many small moments that are making me spiral.

First week: we kept having random eye contact. Like the kind where you look up and the other person is already looking at you. Idk if it means anything but it kept happening.

Then one day I walked to his department to find his supervisor. I know he saw me coming from far away (my shoes are loud and he’s the type who notices everything lol). When I asked him something, he answered without looking up from his laptop, super cold, no eye contact, like he didn’t want me there. I walked away thinking “ok nvm maybe he hates me.”

BUT a few hours later I came back to ask again (his colleague still wasn’t around), and suddenly he was smiley, made eye contact, and replied super nicely?? Like a complete 180. I was shocked.

Next day, I saw him in the marketing area. I looked at him because I was wondering why he was there, and he looked back. We ended up having this long few-seconds eye contact until he quickly looked down like he got shy or something.

Another time, he walked past the pantry while I was having lunch with my team. We made eye contact AGAIN for like 5 seconds before I got shy and looked away.

And the weirdest one: I went to the pantry to wash my bottle. He was there looking at the coffee machine. I ignored him and washed my bottle. After like 3 seconds, I looked up and he was literally GONE. Like he disappeared instantly. He havent even made himself a cup of coffee which he initially wanted to..??

So now I don’t know… Is he shy? Is he avoiding me because he felt awkward? Was the cold moment just him being busy? Or am I just delusional and reading into everything??

I kinda find him really cute and I want to get to know him… but idk if the interest is mutual or if I’m overthinking every small thing.

This unplanned surprise quest has been soul destroying, after a soul draining marriage, after a handful of soul crushing loves. My happiest years were just working at the coffee shop, living small town life, being single and vibing with friends…”love” aka attraction always ruins it. Every. Single. Time.

It’s basically reflexive to search for “love”. I’m a 5th house moon. I’m always romantically involved unless I’m in a relationship, and I take commitment seriously. I don’t cheat or play around.

I think I need to get off this treadmill of misery and let go of romantic love. It’s been illusionary. I’m the romantic one! I’ve never been romanced! Ugh. 😑

What am I afraid of? Being alone? I love being alone. Even when in a relationship I’m technically alone because I attach to unavailable people. That’s not the fear at all.

The fear isn’t abandonment. Everyone is free to change their mind or leave. I can handle a breakup. It’s the betrayal I can’t handle. Ever. It kills me. That’s the issue. That’s always the issue.

What am I holding onto? The fantasy of being with someone who I get along with, who holds me and kisses me, and soothes me with their touch. Someone who doesn’t mess with my head, heart, self worth or stability. That’s basically what I’m desperately holding onto as an idea. It’s probably never going to happen. I’m 44. I’m that person! I’ve never met that person.

Neptune at 29 degrees. It’s time to let the dream die. I may not ever find romantic love or romantic stability. It’s time to make peace with that.

Managing finances in Morocco is honestly a pain.

Most tools you use today: 

1. • Have zero idea what DGI compliance even means 

2. • Force you to work in English • Make you calculate VAT manually every single time 

3. • Don’t support Arabic 

4. • And waste you 10–15 hours a month just trying to make things work

5. We got tired of it. So we built something actually made for Morocco.

What Liqom does

Straightforward features that work for real Moroccan businesses: 

\* • Create invoices in 2 minutes (DGI compliant, VAT auto-calculated) 

\* • Work in French or Arabic — your choice 

\* • AI extracts data from supplier invoices (no more manual typing) 

\* • Convert quotes to invoices in one click 

\* • Track payments and who owes you what in real time 

\* • Everything in MAD. Everything compliant. Everything simple.

Try it out : No credit card. No tricks. No nonsense.

1pkk9m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1pkk9m7/incompatible_because_im_not_active_in_church_at/,Incompatible because I'm not active in church at the moment?,"I'm a 34m who recently had a coffee date with a 28f that I met on Hinge. For some background about myself, I work as a healthcare professional, am educated - I have a doctorate, and I take care of myself. I do not date a lot, that is, I have been single most of my life...I'd say I've been in a self-improvement mode and focusing on other areas of my life up to this point. I have 1 close male friend, but overall I'd say I'm lonely. I was raised Catholic and attended Catholic school, but I have not been active in a church in years, but I do believe in God and occasionally attend Catholic mass. 

I thought my date went relatively well, she hugged me in the beginning, and her leg kept touching my leg when we were seated (supposedly that's a good thing). Towards the end I told her I hoped I wasn't too nervous. When our date was about to end I told her I had so many more questions I wanted to ask her, and she reached out and gave me a hug...and I can't stop crying about it! Something was just so genuine and kind about the hug...and I don't know if it's because I'm lonely and she sensed it, or maybe she was just being kind. I know what lust is and I'm pretty sure that's not what I'm feeling, and I would do anything to find a woman like her. A kind, beautiful, Christian woman. I'm struggling with the thought that I may never find such a woman.

Anyways, she messaged later and said we were not compatible because she's looking for someone whose faith is super important to them. Here's the red flag on my part, I messaged her on facebook after she unmatched me to ask what she meant and she responded someone who is active in their faith and church, then she said not to message her on facebook again and then she blocked me on facebook. ...If it were that simple then why wouldn't she ask me to attend church with her? Because I do not currently attend church means my faith is not important to me?

She told me which church she attends (a Baptist church), and now I really want to go. But she unmatched me and blocked me on facebook, clearly she doesn't have any romantic interest in me. 

I'm supposed to be a grown man, but I can't stop crying about her. I've gotten rejected before, but I've never cried like this before and this just feels different. Maybe my self-improvement journey now needs to include attending church. I actually like the pastor at the church she attends. Though I don't think it'd be a good idea for me to attend the same service that she attends. Would it be strange for a 34 yo, soon to be 35 yo, man to attend church alone? I wouldn't know anyone there.

1pkk7kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowStakesConspiracies/comments/1pkk7kn/the_movie_elf_and_instant_noodle_brand_samyang/,The movie Elf and instant noodle brand Samyang are used by the Flying Spaghetti Monster’s disgruntled relative to aid the war between carbs and clanker protein.,"If you have been online within the past 20 years, you may have come across an image of what we now refer to as the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), and you may further be aware of its existence as the all-knowing entity of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. According to Bobby Henderson (one of the leading figures of the church) in the “About” page for the church’s website, FSM has existed for thousands of years, with much information about how He constructed the Earth being unknown. Given that, it would not be unwarranted for one to consider that He might have a relative, as such information could possibly be included in the vast range of knowledge that is still being collected on FSM’s existence. This relative could have been a piece of His noodle appendages that broke off into another entity, who I will call the Sedentary Insalatonde Critter (insalatonde is an ear-shaped noodle), through binary fission (as the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is indeed very scientific). His name abbreviation, SIC, is also quite telling of the type of being he is: a guy with epically sick plans. Bobby further shares at the end of the “About” page that knowledge of FSM became much more widespread and popular in 2005, which occurred not too long after the widespread knowledge on a classic holiday movie many of us will be subjected to remembering this Christmas season.

This description belongs to no other movie than *Elf*, which was released in 2003, two years before the initial growth in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. This could not be just a coincidence, as there must be a connection and reason for why these events happened in the order they did. This connection is thoroughly supported in one of the film’s more iconic scenes: The forbidden sugar spaghetti meal scene with the maple syrup, candy, and broken poptarts mixed into plain pasta noodles. This scene comes up in an earlier section of the movie in which the main character, Buddy the Elf, attempts to cook for his newfound family (consisting of his long lost father) using his knowledge of the necessary food groups from his time of living with the elves in the North Pole (which was all his life). As Will Ferrell, Buddy’s actor, shared in an interview with the Daily Mail news outlet, he himself was the one who created the dish, being that it was something that he stated needed to be improvised. Aside from the similarities in presence of unconventional pasta figures, there are other aspects to this movie suggesting that Mr. Ferrel’s statement is not all that it seems, as well as how his fruition of the meal was not an accident of his imagination. Looking at IMDb’s cast list for *Elf*, we see some last names: Ferrel, Sedaris, Richter, Fischetti, Farris, and Panozzo. These names sound a lot like Farfalle, Sedanini, Riccioli, Pennette, Fusilli, and Penne, respectively, which are all pasta names listed in a pasta type guide that was posted to the r/coolguides subreddit. These are just a few examples. There is definitely a connection between the members who worked in the *Elf* cast and Sedentary Insalatonde Creature, as we see that the noodle connection is literally part of their bloodline, but they tried to obscure it with twisted pronunciations. They must be part of the mission to accomplish something with SIC, and that is further shown in the movie’s other impacts (aside from promoting strange spaghetti figures that would cause people to develop a positive association with the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and thus SIC, before He would see the light of publicity). 

One of such impacts is in how the spaghetti meal in *Elf*  has changed the way that people who have seen the film think. Writer Molly Codyre explains in her Foodism article on film meals that “when we’re watching a film or television show, and someone picks up a sandwich and moves it towards their mouth…we’re even more inclined to develop a desire for that particular food,” since the human brain is hardwired to seek out food and creates stronger memories of movie details related to it. This is something that SIC would be able to take advantage of in his plan, especially within younger generations, as they would view the movie during a time when they are very impressionable and creating core memories. The memories created with food are therefore going to be much stronger, making young people feel a greater affinity and nostalgia for the culinary catastrophe in *Elf*. Young adults who watched the movie when they were children are striking examples of this being an effective part of the plan, as these are the same groups of people in terms of age range who are online replicating the sweet spaghetti meal and making other weird noodle dishes, like pasta made from ground pasta, tacos filled with noodles, or burgers made with buns made from noodles. You can adjust noodles in any weird way to your liking, and once you do, you’re going to be okay with buying more noodles to repeat that meal. By influencing people to make egregious noodle dishes, this also causes people who have enjoyed or been at least okay with normal, conventional noodle meals to stand their ground on promoting normal pasta dishes. Overall, people everywhere are finding noodle dishes they will gladly, proudly stand for, whether it be a very traditional pasta dish or a wacky combo dish. It’s like a war where everyone’s essentially promoting the same basic food, but part of something bigger.

So, what is SIC’s plan? 

The plan to win back humanity from Big Protein clankers, that’s what.

Think about it. Protein has been incredibly popular and raged about online for a while now, leaving carbs in the dust. Carbs have also comparatively been pretty demonized, especially refined ones like pasta. That might seem to be a result of people trying to figure out how to keep their gym bro build, but nothing is as it truly seems. This must truly be the long awaited indicator of nutritional warfare. 

Protein promotion online has also happened with another online phenomenon: the rise of the clankers and AI slop content. Clearly, these two must be connected, as it cannot be an accident of both protein obsession and clanker prevalence engulfing social media existing in the same time period. Seeing as how clankers know everything, they must be driving Big Protein rather than Big Protein driving them. This is incredibly important for the younger generations.

As we have seen, Gen Z is in fact very vulnerable to being easily influenced by internet food trends, such as the sugary coffee trend that has also ravaged the internet. We see this in people who are probably Millennials as well. Since videos on the internet are there to stay forever, it would not be too far from the truth to state that Gen Alpha and Gen Beta are next to be part of the protein indoctrination. The clankers have promoted the protein trend way too well with how social media and personal values are set up now. It would not be enough for SIC to depend on these younger generations to have been indoctrinated with pro-pasta rhetoric as children through *Elf*.

That is why it was so important for SIC to use some brand that could potentially serve as the perfect viral child: Samyang instant noodles. Samyang is a Korean brand that makes instant noodles and is most known for its spicy ramen product Buldak noodles, which have been the subject of spice challenges on the internet for at least the past decade. Samyang was promoted by *Elf*, which is supported by a Statista graph of Samyang sales from 2015 to 2024 showing that sales increased significantly. This came after the release of *Elf* in 2003 and after the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was popularized in 2005, and since everything in the past leads to the future, *Elf*  helped with promoting more entities in the noodle industry, such as Samyang. Where Samyang really shines is in how it has effectively captivated the younger generation’s minds in the same way that protein has. These are the same noodles that are also used in the noodle-taco-burger meals that people post about in muckbangs and such, and given the Foodism article’s findings of the human mind paying very close attention to content with food, it is likely that the people watching, who are primarily young people, are developing strong positive connections with the noodles. This is supported by another Statista graph from this August showing how Buldak is a highly popular brand for Gen Z. They all want to live the lives of the Buldak mukbangers.

You may be wondering how so much effort could be put into a pro-carbs movement against Big Protein yet protein still dominates recommended pages and diet channels. This is where we are all wrong, as we are underestimating the power and all-knowing-ness that SIC developed from his binary fission from FSM. By allowing protein to win the minds of so many humans for an extended period of time, as we have seen in the past few years, people will begin realizing that carbs are now the underdog, and so they will feel bad for carbs. They will begin advocating for carbs and inciting a movement in which even more people break free from the grasps of Big Protein because of the injustice and demonization of carbohydrates, especially refined ones like pasta. People will run back to the silly noodle dishes that they have loved since childhood.

This might seem like a non-peaceful thing for a descendent of FSM to indulge in, and thus seemingly uncharacteristic. But think about it. You are what you eat, so if we all eat more noodles, we all become noodles. If we are all noodles, we can’t fight with each other anymore. Boom.

1pkk4iy,https://i.redd.it/va8kt61mnp6g1.jpeg,Do I just suck or is this micromanaging?,"This is going to be a long post! It’s just some frustrations I’m dealing with at my 4th day of work. You may skip some parts if you’d like.

I work in a restaurant that serves traditional lattes/ cappuccino drinks. This is how I was introduced to coffee lattes and art. I also upgraded my Breville machine at home cuz I really like coffees and that’s all the basics I had. I recently got my first ever barista job as my part time. I’m super eager to learn but the experience of working with my coworkers and boss is really frustrating and annoying. They are always watching me and call me out whenever I’m not doing something their way.

Today I was pouring hot water into espresso shot to make an americano but my trainer (who is usually cool) called me out. I learnt that’s the way to make Americano but he was upset and said “You have to be more professional! Who taught you that! We pour the shot last!”. I weakly argued that that would be a long black instead, but I respected his decision because he thought it is aesthetically prettier since more crema would be floating on top, plus most people wouldn’t really care. I just don’t appreciate being said unprofessional for doing things the actual way.

Also today, a customer asked for espresso over ice but instead of pulling his shot straight into the ice, I let it run through a glass mug first. I have had really bitter espresso on ice. I learnt that some places pour it separately so that the ice doesn’t shock the espresso, resulting in an extremely bitter shot. I tried that since there was no line. Our kitchen lady sees it a say “why are you doing this? Just pour it down into the ice straightaway.” And this is only one of the thousands of things she questions me throughout the day. Everything she sees me do something she would go “be careful, don’t make mistake!”, “the boss is watching though the camera!”EVEN when I’m just tryin to stamp a freaking logo onto our paper cups!! I swear I was broken that point because all the cups end up looking worst than before.

Besides that, my boss also hasn’t enroll me into any payroll nor given me a clock in code. I used her code to put in order and send her my hours everyday. The good thing is that she feeds us. However, I was calculating tips to share with the kitchen lady like all other baristas does yesterday but my boss started questioning me about how I get to see the tips. I said I don’t remember but I got help from other baristas and it took us a while to figure it out. She was annoyed and told me not to do that again because I don’t have a clock in code. My trainer then told me not to check the tips because she doesn’t like to let us see the sales/ tipping report. Not even he himself can see the tips. I still don’t understand what it means because all barista literally calculate and divide their tips after every shift. It’s probably just me. I hate the lack of transparency and it sketches me out. 

The first day of training my trainer he left the wet rags on the counter. I asked if we have sanitizer bucket for it and he said no, the rag was already rinsed in sanitizer so we kept reusing the same rag throughout my training shift. In the end of the training, he showed me a bucket of sanitizer he placed on the floor and I didn’t understand what it was - but later I found out that the bucket is the sanitizer bucket that they place in case the health department comes visit. 

I found out the hard way on my first official day when I completely forgot to place the sanitizer bucket under the sink - the bucket that my trainer never touched during my entire training. I didn’t even know that’s the bucket’s was for and I thought they needed it to wash the floor or something. Truth is otherwise. In fact, they’re not even supposed to leave the sanitizer bucket ON the floor, and they’re supposed to keep th wet rags in there (which was my first question during my training) and label the bucket with time and date, and switch it out every four hours. These were the steps we follow at my restaurant jobs so I actually know pretty well. But because I didn’t place the bucket that they never use anyways, my boss threaten to fire me “I’m sorry but if this happens again, you can’t work here,”

I was called out on my 2nd shift by my kitchen lady because i keep switching to new rags. I understand that we are a small cafe so instead i started washing and reusing the same rag. On my 3rd shift, my boss came in. She sees me wiping down a kitchen table with the rag I thought they wanted me to use - but apparently wrong. The same kitchen lady pointed at 3-5 different rags she has all over the kitchen and gave me a confusing talk (and tbh I don’t remember what she wanted me to use at this point). Then today, I used THAT rag I thought she wanted to wipe down her table only for her to ask “why do you use this? I used this to polish silverware”.

She is the sweetest partner I can ever have at this new place but I’m starting to feel more and more uncomfortable. I feel like I’m manifesting mistakes! It’s like telling me not to think of an elephant.

I worked in restaurants for 3years and we usually use cotton rag for food contact surfaces and terry rag for general tables. I hate that now even using a rag would give me so much anxiety.

I love my coworkers but my co-workers and my boss are super pinky pointy to a point I start freaking out making any decisions. I’m making more and more mistakes that I wouldn’t usually do. I obviously have a lot to learn. I’m not a professional barista and I might be far from it. But I know one day I will be, and I will be a great one. I just don’t know if this is normal or they’re just doing too much.

NimBLE, Service UUIDs & Reverse Engineering","I'm in over my head ... have been for several days now, but with a little persistence and a whole lot of help from LLMs, I've made enough progress to actually ask for help.

On my desk is a ESP32C6, a motor driver and a pile of Lego. I'd love to control it all by connecting the X15 via Bluetooth Low Energy.

I mean, look:  [arduino-XboxSeriesXControllerESP32](https://github.com/asukiaaa/arduino-XboxSeriesXControllerESP32), it's using an Arduino library NimBLE, sets up some callbacks, decodes the output and Bob's your uncle.  (It works)

No dice.  (It doesn't work).  Lets startup a Android BLE scanner app and see what if this thing actually supports BLE, but a little background first.

A bluetooth device advertises that it can do certain things, like monitor your heatrate or play music by advertising services via UUIDs (bit numbers) that are registered with the Bluetooth SIG.

Service: uuid: d7f010e0-660d-46e9-96c3-19c4148bdab5

Service: uuid: **0xff12**

Hmm...  
The Bluetooth SIG service UUID for the Human Interface Device (HID) service is the 16-bit value **0x1812**

\--nojoy

But it does something... I can poke it with a stick by writing random values to random locations and that makes it rumble!

    NimBLERemoteService* pService = pClient->getService(SERVICE_UUID);
    NimBLERemoteCharacteristic* pProtocolModeChar = pService->getCharacteristic(WRITE_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID);
    if (pProtocolModeChar && pProtocolModeChar->canWrite()) {
    uint8_t protocolMode = 0x01;  // Report Protocol Mode
    pProtocolModeChar->writeValue(&protocolMode, 1, true)

But, I think this is for the Android Keylink app for setting up your controller.

So, I don't think **Shenzhen Yisuma** is a very big company. Somewhere, the one embedded engineer who makes all this work is browsing Reddit over his 3rd cup of coffee for the day and might see this.

Im currently training to run the NYC half in March - its going to be my first half marathon that I've actually properly trained for (I've run 2 others on a coffee and a dream lol) so I'm really excited! Prior to training I was averaging about 30 miles a week anywhere from a 8min to a 9min pace, so nothing crazy. My only real goal for this is that I desperately want to finish sub 2 hour.

I started my training plan this week and I'm struggling with maintaining the slower paces it wants me to do for my easier runs. Fo context I do not have any sort of fitness watch so I have to intermittently check my phone, but even with doing that I find myself slowing down for a bit but eventually speeding back up to a sub 9min time, which is what I typically run at but I dont want to burn myself out as Im increasing my mileage and keep reading everywhere that I need to take it slow to avoid.

So basically, does anyone have any advice for maintaining slower paces without a fitness watch? Also can someone explain why I need to be doing these runs at such a slow pace/is it going to hurt me over the next 12 weeks if I cant get it under control?

This is a commission-only sales role, and it does involve cold calling offices by phone to arrange sample drops, followed by in-person drops and follow-ups. Scripts and guidance provided.

What the role involves:

	•	Cold calling offices to arrange sample drops

	•	Dropping samples to offices in Wellington CBD

	•	Following up by phone and converting offices into clients

	•	Logging activity in a simple shared form (nothing corporate)

What it suits:

	•	Someone confident on the phone

	•	Comfortable with rejection

	•	Looking for flexible, outcome-based work

	•	Happy with commission rather than hourly pay

What it’s not:

	•	Not a salary or hourly role

	•	Not a passive side hustle

	•	Not just walking and dropping samples

Commission is paid on new offices you bring on, with strong upside for good months. This works best as a side gig alongside study or other work.

1pkjvg0,https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/05/29/pure-thought-on-paper-sunday-olivier-schrauwen/,Just finished Sunday by Olivier Schrauwen. Incredible and Hilarious,"After seeing how frequently \*Arsène Schrauwen\* was recommended in the tournament of lists, I really wanted to check it out. While I enjoyed Schrauwen’s unique style the story didn’t particularly resonate with me. But I had also checked out \*Sunday\* and decided to read that as next. 

The story follows a single day in the life of a Belgian man, with his thoughts filling the top of every panel.  The art covers his life while also moving to follow other characters connected to him as they move through their day. It’s an interesting experiment and the art and layout are used skillfully to convey the range of thoughts that pass through someone’s mind. 

But my favorite part was how unexpectedly funny it was. I know Schwauren has a sense of humor in his writings, but his other books didn’t hit me the same way. I don’t know if I was just in the right mood, or if this specific story connected to me, but reading the banal, and rather self-important thoughts of this man as he sits around on his couch hiding from his neighbors and getting drunk was hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud more than once,  while still appreciating the craft of the story. 

The contrast between the art and the text was essential to the beauty, and the humour of the book. Dozens of small panels show the main character lying on a couch, wrinkling his eyebrows, picking his nose, sipping coffee, scarcely showing any movement. Meanwhile the text shows the jumbled activity of his thoughts in all their absurdity jumping between topics, nagging worries about his relationships, song lyrics, philosophical musings, and the desire for another cup of coffee. It’s hard to take the pretentious attempts at philosophical thought seriously as you watch the man stumbling around drunk alone in his home. 

It’s always such a treat to find a new story that not only clicks with you as reader, but also show such technical skill and craftsmanship. This was an amazing book and I highly recommend it. My only criticism is that the ending, though both thematically and structurally perfect, left me desperate to see what happened next! I’m looking forward to reading more of Schrauwen’s work. I think I need to revisit \*Parallel Lives\*, his only other book I remember reading. 

While googling around I saw that Chris Ware had a great review of \*Sunday\* in \*The New York Review\* so I wanted to share that as well if you want to hear a more thoughtful analysis of the book from someone who actually knows what they’re talking about.

Prompt issued to LLM1, meaning ChatGPT 5.1 apprised earlier about Bridge360 Metatheory Model and related conversations:

The content of this Youtube episode fits Bridge360 Metatheory Model comparison and contrast of autocracy and democracy as political systems as discussed in a handful of conversations here with you. Correct or incorrect?

LLM1 response:

Short answer: **mostly correct** — this episode is very compatible with your Bridge360 comparison of autocracy vs. democracy, but it is working implicitly inside the truth-seeking / normative frame, not the entropy-governance frame.

Let me map it explicitly.

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!URho!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbecb4890-0763-4a12-925e-e1f4b2f58703_474x219.jpeg)

# 1. What the episode is doing (in Bridge360 terms)

From the title and associated write-ups, the Asian Boss piece is essentially about the **“hidden costs” of Singapore’s success**: strong, centralized, technocratic governance delivering high stability and growth, but with rising inequality, mental-health stress, and constraints on political freedom and civic voice.([Medium](https://medium.com/%40abayserkebayev/the-hidden-costs-of-singapores-success-the-detailed-review-59091795b670?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

In Bridge360 language, it is:

* Describing a **low-entropy, high-control governance attractor** – PAP dominance, tightly managed media and dissent, top-down policy execution.
* Showing the **entropy bill**: – inequality, cost-of-living pressures, demographic decline, mental-health issues, low social trust.([Medium](https://medium.com/%40abayserkebayev/the-hidden-costs-of-singapores-success-the-detailed-review-59091795b670?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Hinting that the same structure that produced “miracle” performance is now generating **fragility and tension** that must be rebalanceable.

That is exactly the pattern you have been using to contrast:

* **Autocracy / soft-authoritarian technocracy**: – High short-term performance, low visible noise; population and migrants as entropy sinks; systemic fragility if corrections are blocked.
* **Democracy (when it is working)**: – More visible noise and delay, but higher distributed diagnostics and redundancy; better long-run adaptation if not captured by oligarchic memes.

So on that level, yes: **it is an empirical case study that sits nicely inside your Bridge360 autocracy–democracy contrast.**

# 2. Where it aligns with Bridge360 Metatheory

1. **Entropy attractor vs. truth attractor**
   * The video/article does not claim Singapore is simply “good” or “bad” — it surfaces the *trade-offs* and tensions inside the current attractor: prosperity + order vs. inequality + stress + constrained voice.([Medium](https://medium.com/%40abayserkebayev/the-hidden-costs-of-singapores-success-the-detailed-review-59091795b670?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * That meshes with your framing of governance forms as **entropy configurations**, not moral absolutes.
2. **Short-term stability vs. long-term Volatility Paradox**
   * Singapore’s model: tight control + investor confidence → high growth, cleanliness, safety.
   * The same mechanisms produce: wage share compression, mental-health burden, low fertility, low social trust — i.e., **latent fragility** that may express as future shocks.([Medium](https://medium.com/%40abayserkebayev/the-hidden-costs-of-singapores-success-the-detailed-review-59091795b670?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * That is almost a textbook instance of the **Volatility Paradox** you keep invoking: suppress small perturbations, accumulate hidden stress.
3. **Autocracy as “entropy sink engineering”**
   * Centralised governance channels risk away from capital and investors and into:
      * workers (wage suppression, long hours),
      * migrants,
      * constrained civil society.([Medium](https://medium.com/%40abayserkebayev/the-hidden-costs-of-singapores-success-the-detailed-review-59091795b670?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * This matches your description of autocratic systems using people as **entropy sinks** to keep the macro-metrics smooth.
4. **Hybrid regime as a sliding point on the autocracy–democracy axis**
   * Singapore is formally a parliamentary democracy, but functionally a **hybrid** with a dominant party, skewed playing field, and bounded opposition.([Medium](https://medium.com/%40abayserkebayev/the-hidden-costs-of-singapores-success-the-detailed-review-59091795b670?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * That lines up with our earlier discussions of **Band A/B/C** regimes and the idea that “autocracy vs democracy” is not binary but a **continuous entropy-governance spectrum.**

So on these four pillars, I would mark it **consistent with the Bridge360 diagnostic lens.**

# 3. Where it diverges from, or is incomplete under, Bridge360

Where I would mark “not yet Bridge360”:

1. **Still anchored in truth-seeking and moral vocabulary**
   * The critique is framed in terms of inequality, rights, happiness, “hidden costs,” etc. — i.e., **normative** language.([Medium](https://medium.com/%40abayserkebayev/the-hidden-costs-of-singapores-success-the-detailed-review-59091795b670?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * Bridge360 v17.x wants a **truth-neutral, entropy-budget vocabulary**: not “good/bad governance,” but “low-noise, high-fragility configuration with rising long-run risk.”
2. **Mostly intra-Singapore; not yet a node in the global system**
   * The episode focuses on Singapore’s domestic tensions.
   * Bridge360 would embed Singapore as a **Node** in the global operating system:
      * A financial / logistics hub absorbing and re-exporting entropy from US-, China-, and East-Asia-Shield dynamics.
   * That global node framing is missing; it’s implied but not explicit.
3. **No explicit treatment of memetic attractors**
   * The video does not name the **memes** that keep the system in its current basin:
      * “Meritocracy,” “pragmatism,” “stability over freedom,” “national vulnerability,” etc.
   * In Bridge360, those are key **rules-of-inference memes** stabilising the autocracy-leaning attractor.
4. **No budget language (ε–F–B) or explicit fragility mapping**
   * It lists symptoms, but does not quantify or gate them as:
      * ε (entropy / diversity): how constrained is variance of political and civic expression?
      * F (fragility): what is the probability that inequality + mental health + fertility combine into a systemic break?
      * B (budget): how much policy “room” exists before blow-out?
   * That is exactly what a Bridge360 rewrite of the episode would add.

# 4. Bottom line

If I translate your yes/no question into Bridge360 form:

>

My answer is:

* **Correct in spirit**: it is a very usable case study of a **high-performance, low-entropy, soft-authoritarian attractor** starting to show its long-term entropy bill.
* **Incomplete in formalism**: it still speaks the language of **truth, justice, and fairness**, not **ε–F–B budgets, Volatility Paradox, and memetic attractors**.

If you like, next step could be:

* I can rewrite the “Hidden Costs of Singapore’s Success” analysis in full **Bridge360 v17.1 governance-neutral parlance**, with:
   * Node classification for Singapore,
   * ε–F–B sketch,
   * and explicit mapping to autocracy–democracy spectrum as entropy attractors.

Prompt issued to LLM1:

Yes, please.

LLM1 response:

Here is a Bridge360 v17.1-style modeling of the **Asian Boss “Why It’s So Hard to Get Rich in Singapore” episode** as a governance-neutral case study of autocracy/democracy as entropy attractors.

I will treat the video’s Singapore as an observed **Node**, not as “good” or “bad,” but as a configuration with a particular entropy profile and fragility structure.([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBS3fAqY0lw&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# 1. Node classification: “Singapore Hub Node” (SG-Node)

**Type:**

* City-state, high-density, high-capita-income, trade-finance-logistics hub.([ess.org.sg](https://ess.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Selena-Ling-Quality-of-Life-SEPF-31Oct23.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Primary functions (flows):**

* **Inbound capital & wealth**
   * Billionaires and millionaires immigrating / routing assets to Singapore; rise in single-family offices.([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiC3ezjUkCk&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Inbound labour & human capital**
   * High-skill professionals attracted by salaries, safety, and infrastructure.
   * Migrant / lower-wage workers providing services under tighter constraints.
* **Outbound services and narratives**
   * Financial, logistics, and tech services exported globally.
   * Narrative exported: *“efficient, safe, well-run, pro-business hub.”*
* **Internal redistribution**
   * State tax-and-transfer mechanisms partially compress inequality ex-post (Gini after transfers lower than market Gini, but still higher than many advanced peers).([Ministry of Finance (MOF)](https://www.mof.gov.sg/news-resources/newsroom/singapore-public-sector-outcomes-review-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

In Bridge360 terms, SG-Node is a **highly tuned entropy router**: importing financial / geopolitical volatility from larger systems (US, China, global capital) and transforming it into domestically visible order plus locally concentrated social/psychological strain.

# 2. Governance attractor on the autocracy–democracy spectrum

From the episode plus public sources, the effective pattern is:

* Formal **electoral democracy** with:
   * Regular elections.
   * Opposition parties allowed but structurally disadvantaged.
* De facto **soft-authoritarian technocracy**:
   * Dominant party, high centralization of agenda-setting, strong state influence over media and public space.
   * High enforcement against disorder, defamation, and certain kinds of protest.

This can be treated as a **hybrid attractor**:

* **On the “autocracy” side of the axis:**
   * Low public political noise (tight control of contentious expression).
   * High speed of policy execution.
   * Strong signalling to capital markets that rules will be stable and investor-friendly.
* **On the “democracy” side of the axis:**
   * Preserved electoral mechanisms and some institutional checks.
   * Bounded but non-zero space for public critique, alternative parties, and incremental policy correction.

Under Bridge360, we do not label this as “good governance” or “bad governance”; we label it as a **low-entropy, high-control, high-performance attractor** with specific **fragility channels** and an **entropy bill** that shows up in the episode:

* High cost of living, especially housing.([The Independent Singapore News](https://theindependent.sg/young-singaporeans-say-sgs-high-cost-of-living-may-be-the-top-reason-for-singapores-low-birth-rate/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* High and/or complex inequality (market-level Gini very high; post-redistribution still higher than comparable rich countries).([InsideOut Well](https://www.insideoutwell.com/post/the-link-between-financial-security-and-wellbeing-a-path-forward-in-singapore-s-economic-climate?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Stress, mental-health strains, and low fertility among younger cohorts.([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14b8gZRTiY8&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# 3. ε–F–B sketch for the Singapore Hub Node

Heuristic, qualitative sketch (not a calibration):

https://preview.redd.it/90f0qk9lgp6g1.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e61f2af3cb49f38f4ae6e0acaed3e0bd49ee9d0

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BTGT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6daa4a8-a04c-4afb-b75d-c8745952df49_1123x737.png)

In words: the SG-Node has **ample B in money and technical capacity, but limited B in narrative flexibility**, with **ε kept low to preserve hub attractiveness**, and **F creeping upward in the population’s lived experience.**

# 4. Entropy bill and “who carries the noise”

Under the video’s narrative, the pattern is consistent with the Bridge360 picture of autocracy-leaning systems using specific groups as **entropy sinks**:

1. **Local middle and lower-income residents**
   * Face high housing and living costs; struggle to accumulate capital despite working in a very wealthy node.([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBS3fAqY0lw&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * Carry stress, long hours, and opportunity costs.
2. **Migrant workers and lower-status labour**
   * Provide infrastructural and service labour under more constrained bargaining power.
3. **Future generations**
   * Lower fertility and delayed family formation suggest that some of the entropy is being shifted into the **demographic future** (fewer young to support aging cohorts).([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14b8gZRTiY8&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
4. **Political opposition / alternative narratives**
   * A share of systemic noise that could surface as early-warning diagnostics is suppressed, channelled into self-censorship, or exits the system (emigration, disengagement).

From a Bridge360 lens, this is **not a moral critique** but a mapping: the system keeps **macro-level volatility low** by letting **micro- and meso-level entropy** be absorbed by those groups.

# 5. Autocracy vs democracy as entropy attractors: where SG-Node sits

Using the Bridge360 contrast:

* **Autocracy attractor**
   * Centralized diagnostics.
   * Low public entropy.
   * High reliance on directed loyalty and fear/discipline signals.
   * Risk: large blind spots; late and discontinuous corrections; Volatility Paradox.
* **Democracy attractor**
   * Distributed diagnostics and narrative competition.
   * Higher visible entropy and slower decisions.
   * Risk: gridlock, short-termism, memetic capture.

**Singapore in the episode**:

* Functionally **near the autocracy end** on:
   * Centralization of correction mechanisms.
   * Control over high-impact public narratives.
   * Priority of investor/stability signals over bottom-up noise.
* Still **retains some democratic attractor features**:
   * Elections, courts, consultative processes, incremental social spending and reforms (e.g., targeted redistribution, acknowledgement of inequality and mental health issues).([Ministry of Finance (MOF)](https://www.mof.gov.sg/news-resources/newsroom/singapore-public-sector-outcomes-review-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

In v17.1 language, that places SG-Node in a **hybrid entropy basin**:

* **Band A performance metrics** (growth, infrastructure, investor confidence).
* **Band B-type stresses** emerging in social cohesion, mental health, and fertility.

The Asian Boss episode is then an empirical **surface scan** of that hybrid basin: it shows how the same attractor that delivered extraordinary order now generates its own **internal entropy bill** as inequality and stress become more salient.

# 6. How you can use this episode inside Bridge360

If you want to integrate this explicitly into your larger autocracy–democracy work:

1. Treat the video as a **calibrated case** of:
   * “High-performance, low-noise, soft-authoritarian hub”
   * With **increasing F despite strong B**, due to constrained ε and concentrated entropy sinks.
2. Contrast SG-Node with:
   * A noisy but adaptive democracy node (e.g., a mid-level European state with higher ε, lower inequality, higher tax, but less hub performance).
   * A hard autocracy node (e.g., where even mild criticism is criminalized and capital is less confident).
3. Use the **episode’s concrete human stories** as:
   * Illustrative data points for the **Volatility Paradox**.
   * Examples of **diagnostic signals** that are present but not yet fully integrated into the governance budget.

If you want, I can next generate:

* A **short, governance-neutral note** that frames Singapore’s current configuration and risks for policymakers (e.g., MAS / MOF / EDB audience) strictly in ε–F–B terms, without any moral or ideological language.

Prompt issued to LLM1:

Yes, please.

LLM1 response:

Below is a concise, governance-neutral advisory note framed in ε–F–B terms, suitable for internal policymakers in Singapore (e.g., MAS / MOF / EDB / PMO-level readers).

# Advisory Note: Entropy and Fragility Profile of the Singapore Hub Node

*(Bridge360 v17.1 – Governance-Neutral Sketch)*

# 1. System position

Singapore continues to operate as a **high-performance hub node** in the global operating system:

* Strong fiscal position and sizeable reserves; government has no net debt and maintains assets in excess of liabilities.([Ministry of Finance (MOF)](https://www.mof.gov.sg/policies/reserves/what-are-singapores-reserves/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Persistent attractiveness as a capital, talent, and logistics hub, with rising high-end property transactions and continued demand for prime assets.([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-million-dollar-flat-sales-hit-record-q2-market-data-shows-2025-08-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

This configuration reflects a **low-entropy, high-control governance attractor** optimized for stability, investor confidence, and execution speed.

# 2. ε – Entropy (diversity and variance)

On current signals:

* **Economic structure:** High specialization in finance, trade, logistics, and high-value services; housing market is highly financialized with sustained price increases and frequent million-dollar public-housing transactions.([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/singapore-public-housing-resale-prices-rise-96-2024-2025-01-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Socio-political environment:** Narratives emphasize stability, prudence, and performance; public contention and policy variance are present but bounded.

Implication in ε-terms:

* **ε is deliberately kept low to moderate**: noise and variance are constrained to preserve hub reliability.
* This supports capital inflows and operational predictability, but **reduces the system’s tolerance for disruptive feedback** from below.

# 3. F – Fragility (where stress is accumulating)

Three domains show rising **F**:

1. **Inequality and distribution**
   * Pre-transfer Gini remains high; post-transfer Gini has reached its lowest point since 2000 (0.364 in 2024), but still above many advanced peers.([Base](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/news/press13022025.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * The policy mix has successfully flattened part of the curve, yet **relative gaps and lived perceptions of inequality remain salient**.
2. **Cost of living and asset prices**
   * Singapore is among the most expensive cities globally, especially in Asia, with housing a dominant cost driver.([CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-cost-living-expats-housing-prices-5326526?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * Public housing resale prices rose 9.6% in 2024, following several years of sustained gains, and million-dollar resale flats are now common.([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/singapore-public-housing-resale-prices-rise-96-2024-2025-01-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * **Households without significant asset exposure carry more of the entropy** in this configuration.
3. **Demography and long-horizon resilience**
   * Total fertility rate has remained at a historic low of 0.97 in 2023–2024, below replacement by a wide margin despite targeted incentives.([The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/community/2024-the-year-in-singapore-the-dragon-failed-to-deliver-the-stork?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
   * This indicates **latent fragility shifted into the future workforce and support ratios**, even as current metrics remain strong.

Overall:

* **F is rising in social, demographic, and intergenerational layers**, while remaining low in macro-financial stability and institutional competence.

# 4. B – Budget (room to maneuver)

Singapore retains unusually strong **B**:

* **Financial budget:** Deep reserves and a structurally strong balance sheet allow for targeted transfers, counter-cyclical support, and strategic investment.([Ministry of Finance (MOF)](https://www.mof.gov.sg/policies/reserves/what-are-singapores-reserves/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Technical/administrative budget:** High implementation capacity and experience in complex policy orchestration.

However:

* **Narrative and political budget are narrower**:
   * The governance narrative is tightly coupled to stability, prudence, and hub performance.
   * Large shifts in distribution models, housing norms, or demographic interventions can be perceived as inconsistent with the established success formula, which implicitly constrains feasible moves within the current attractor.

The key governance question is therefore **not “Do we have resources?”**, but **“How much ε-increase and rebalancing can be absorbed without weakening the core hub signals?”**

# 5. Volatility Paradox risk

The current configuration exhibits a classic **Volatility Paradox pattern**:

* Low visible volatility at the macro level (strong growth, resilient employment, fiscal strength).([Monetary Authority of Singapore](https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/investing-in-singapore-government-securities/singapores-economy?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Accumulating, partially invisible volatility at the micro and meso levels (inequality perceptions, housing stress, family formation hesitation).

If not periodically relieved via **controlled ε-increases and budget reallocations**, there is a non-trivial risk that:

* Corrections will arrive later,
* With less optionality,
* And in more discontinuous forms (e.g., sudden sentiment shifts, cohort-level disengagement, or accelerated talent outflows).

# 6. Governance-neutral strategic suggestion

Within the current attractor, and without prescribing a political direction, the entropy-governance view suggests:

1. **Use financial B to deliberately lower F in social and demographic subsystems**
   * Continue to strengthen targeted redistribution and wage-floor mechanisms, not primarily as “fairness” measures, but as **entropy-balancing tools** that reduce long-term fragility.
2. **Allocate a controlled ε-increase budget**
   * Create bounded spaces for more diverse diagnostics (policy experimentation, participatory mechanisms, structured feedback channels) that do not undermine core hub commitments, but **increase early-warning resolution.**
3. **Treat housing and fertility as coupled entropy channels**
   * Housing policy, cost of raising children, and long-term demographic resilience should be analyzed as a **single joint system**, not as separate silos, since stress in one amplifies stress in the others.
4. **Codify “entropy buffers” around the hub model**
   * Make explicit where the system is willing to tolerate more noise (e.g., experimentation in social policy, urban design, or labour arrangements) in order to keep **F below thresholds consistent with long-term hub viability.**

This note does not evaluate the system as “good” or “bad.” It identifies where **entropy is currently parked**, where **fragility is building**, and where **budget exists to rebalance** before more abrupt corrections are forced by external shocks or internal exhaustion.

LLM1 response:

Here is a “man on the street” version of that note—same message, but in everyday language and without technical terms.

# Singapore Today: What’s Working, What’s Hurting, What’s Next

*A plain-language snapshot for ordinary Singaporeans*

# 1. Where Singapore stands now

Singapore is still doing many big things right:

* The country is rich, safe, and well run.
* The Government has saved a lot for rainy days.
* Businesses still see Singapore as one of the best places in the world to put their money, set up offices, and base their families.

From the outside, Singapore looks like a model: clean streets, working trains, stable politics, and a strong reputation.

But if you walk around and talk to people, you also hear a different story underneath the surface.

# 2. The success model and its trade-offs

For decades, Singapore has followed one main formula:

* Keep things stable.
* Move fast and efficiently.
* Make sure investors feel safe.
* Avoid messy public fights that can scare businesses away.

This formula has clearly worked in many ways. But every model has a cost. For many ordinary Singaporeans, the costs now feel heavier than before.

Three big areas stand out.

# 3. Problem area #1 – Inequality you can feel

On paper, the Government has schemes that help lower- and middle-income families. Those are real, and they matter.

But on the ground, people still feel a strong gap:

* You see ultra-rich foreigners parking money in properties.
* You see luxury cars, high-end districts, and private clubs.
* At the same time, many families feel they are just “getting by” despite working very hard.

The feeling is not just about numbers in a report. It is about:

* Looking at someone your age who can buy a condo or a landed house, while you are worried about your next housing loan payment.
* Knowing the whole country is richer than ever, but not feeling much of that in your own life.

That gap between **“we are rich”** and **“I don’t feel rich”** is one of the main sources of tension.

# 4. Problem area #2 – Cost of living and housing pressure

Almost every Singapore conversation eventually lands on this:

>

In particular:

* Public housing resale prices have shot up.
* Million-dollar HDB flats, which used to be rare, are now common headlines.
* Food, transport, childcare, and elder care costs add up quickly.

For younger Singaporeans:

* Buying a home feels more like a high-stakes gamble than a straightforward step.
* Even if they manage to get a flat, they worry about mortgage, upgrades, and future medical costs.

It is not that people hate hard work. Singaporeans are used to working hard.  
The problem is the sense that **no matter how hard you work, you’re always one big bill away from trouble**.

# 5. Problem area #3 – Family life and the future

Another sign that something is off: people are having fewer children.

* Singapore’s birth rate has been below replacement level for a long time.
* Even with baby bonuses, grants, and parental policies, many couples still say:
   * “Too expensive.”
   * “Too stressful.”
   * “We’re not ready.”

When ordinary people decide not to have kids or to have fewer kids, it is a signal:

>

That says a lot about the mental load and daily pressure people feel.

# 6. The good news: Singapore has real room to move

Here is the important part that often gets lost:

* The Government has money.
* The country has strong institutions and people who know how to execute policies well.
* Singapore is not a weak or bankrupt state forced to make desperate cuts.

In simple terms:

>

The challenge is not “Do we have enough money or talent?”  
The challenge is “Are we willing to change parts of the formula that made us successful, because the world and our society have changed?”

# 7. Why the current path is risky (even if it looks calm)

From the outside, Singapore looks very steady. But inside, a kind of hidden risk builds up when:

* The economy looks fine,
* The rich are doing very well,
* The government balance sheet is strong,
* Yet many ordinary people feel tired, stuck, or left behind.

This is like a pressure cooker:

* On the surface, everything is tidy and quiet.
* Inside, pressure grows.
* If you never release the pressure in smaller, controlled ways, you risk a larger, more sudden release later.

That “sudden release” does not need to be a riot or collapse. It can be quieter, but still serious:

* People disengage and stop caring.
* Young talent leaves and does not come back.
* Social trust declines.
* Political shocks become more likely when a small spark hits a frustrated population.

# 8. What could be done (without choosing sides)

Without taking any political position, there are some common-sense directions that fit Singapore’s strengths:

1. **Use savings to reduce everyday stress, not just for crises** Not only when there is a pandemic or global crash, but also:
   * To reduce long-term housing pressure, especially for younger and middle-income families.
   * To strengthen support for lower-wage workers, so that they share more fairly in overall prosperity.
2. **Create more space for feedback without chaos** Singapore does not need to copy “shouting match” politics. But it can: This is not about choosing a new “team.” It is about getting earlier warning signals before problems become crises.
   * Open more structured channels where regular people and smaller groups can share honest feedback.
   * Protect some space for new ideas and policies to be tested, even if they go against the usual thinking.
3. **Treat housing, cost of raising children, and aging as one linked problem** Right now, these are often handled in separate conversations: For ordinary people, it all feels like **one big story**:
   * Housing policy,
   * Cost of living,
   * Aging population,
   * Low birth rate.

>

1. Policies that look at this full package together will likely work better than small tweaks here and there.
2. **Decide, as a society, what kind of success we want next** Past success was built around: Future success may need to add:
   * Stability,
   * Attracting foreign capital,
   * Being a world-class hub.
   * A stronger sense of fairness,
   * A more livable pace of life,
   * A clearer belief among ordinary citizens that “this country is also built for me, not just for investors.”

# 9. Final thought

This is not an argument that “Singapore is failing” or “Singapore is perfect.”  
It is a simpler message:

* The current model has brought a lot of benefits.
* It is now also creating new kinds of stress and risk.
* We have the money, talent, and institutions to make adjustments before things break.
* The real question is whether we are willing to open up enough space—carefully and calmly—to listen, experiment, and shift course where needed.

If you want, I can next compress this further into:

* A one-page “coffee shop” version you could imagine two uncles or two Grab drivers talking through,
* Or a short speech you could give to senior high school or college students in Singapore.

Seen several posts lately from people struggling with miter joints who have received some pretty poor advice from posters who, with all due respect, don't really know what they're talking about.  This piece is a good demonstration of the tape-folding technique, which is the best method I am aware of for gluing up any type of miter joint.  A basic summary of this method is as follows:

* Set both pieces on a flat surface, with the points of the miters touching each other on top.
* Strapping across the seam, set down pieces of masking tape (Aquamask preferred) every 6 inches or so. Longer pieces for heavier substrate. You can stretch the tape across to pull small gaps closed.
* Set down a strip of tape along the entire seam. Make sure that it's pressed down fully next to the seam to keep the glue inside.
* Flip over, and apply wood glue (Titebond II) along the entire length of the joint. Make sure your miter is 0.1-0.3 degrees over-angled, to make room for the glue.  Lay a bead about 2/3 the way down one of the miter faces for best coverage; spreading is not necessary.  Aim for minimal squeeze-out.
* Fold and clamp. For larger pieces you can clamp using temporary cauls if you want. I usually just stretch a few tapes between the ends of each piece, with enough tension to hold the joint at the desired angle.
* Burnish the edge of the joint through the tape seam while glue is wet. Some people use the shaft of a screwdriver, I prefer a hardwood block. This will close up any gaps in the joint edge and prevent splintering.

This particular piece started as a Sketchup model to determine the inside and outside face of each facet.  My CNC guy only has access to a 3-axis machine, so we had to fudge the angle of the miters with a bullnose bit to define the inside face, and then rough out each miter edge using hand tools.  

One of the many benefits of the tape-folding method is that you only need the face seam to be precise.  The tape will keep those face edges locked against each other perfectly as you glue and fold the piece together.  Joints with visible interior seams will require extra consideration, of course.

We often talk about setting clear goals and finding our purpose, but I want to shine a light on one of the most crucial—and often most uncomfortable—phases of growth: the 'Undefined' space.

This is the liminal space, the void, the period after a major shift (a breakup, a career change, a deep healing realization) where the old identity has dissolved, but the new one hasn't yet crystallized. We feel definition-less, and honestly, sometimes profoundly lost.

If you are currently feeling 'undefined,' I want you to know this is not a failure state; it is a *required* state for genuine reinvention. True change doesn't happen by painting over the old canvas; it happens when the canvas is stripped bare. But being undefined can feel paralyzing because our human brains crave structure.

We often try to prematurely force a definition, snapping back to old habits or clinging to external structures just to feel *solid* again. The key during this phase is to resist the urge to immediately label the 'new you' and instead, focus on *observing* the 'current you.'

**Actionable Reflection:** When your larger purpose or identity feels vague, we need micro-anchors. Instead of asking, 'Who am I going to be in five years?' ask: 

1.  What small action today makes me feel present?
2.  What simple routine (a 5-minute stretch, making coffee, watering a plant) grounds me in the now?
3.  What is one small thing I learned about myself *today* that I didn't know yesterday?

**My Question for the Community:** 

For those of you who have successfully navigated or are currently navigating an 'undefined' period—when all your major external structures felt shaky or gone—**what is the single most reliable, small anchor or daily ritual that kept you connected to reality and yourself?** Let’s share the practical tips for surviving the beautiful, messy void.",1,1765515644.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

This girl and I were together in high school, I liked her, a lot, and at the end of the course I told her, not looking to be boyfriend and girlfriend or anything (I know, maybe a bad choice, but made sense for me then), but I wanted to express what I felt, you know? That was not fully reciprocated but she took it well and was kind, at least I'm sure she kinda liked me, because she keep a gift I gave her, a necklace that I made and delivered on her birthday with a nice letter and that I wrote. Well, 4 years later, we both studied in different cities and we didn't talk at all, like 0 contact, and a few months ago, she came back, she sent me a message out of nowhere, saying that my gift had given him a lot of luck, at that time I was exploring the possibility of going out with another girl, so I decided to be loyal (terrible decision, this girl was evil), okay, I was polite and left it there for a while, months later I remember it and say ""Why not?"" I send her that ""Hi"" that is scary and she responds quickly, we had a pleasant conversation and so on, from here things begin to happen that lead me to feel something for her again, I follow her on Instagram, she does back, she begins to like my stories, me too, then she replies to them, me too, and I begin to have the initiative to talk more, and in that ping-pong of interactions she has told me very nice things, ""You are very funny, never change"", we respond to each other quickly, we joke, she likes everything (or almost everything) I post, I have her in close friends and she has me too, she sends voice messages, photos of her, compliments and flatters, so do I, I feel like I make her laugh, I have said things like; ""You're great, you brighten my day"", I feel that there is an implicit flirting vibe, there’s been this kinda hypothetical date conversation when I said “What would you I do if I showed up in an Ice Cream truck?” she just laughed and said she would love it, in general what she tells me is really nice...  she is really cute and beautiful of course, she now likes my notes and we send reels to each other (I only send reels to those I love haha), we have that daily chat, she sometimes answers several of my stories a day, and I try to be reciprocal but not very intense, Now I live closer because I changed campus and on this vacation I have thought a lot about inviting her for a coffee, but frankly it scares me that she rejects me and this nice reunion will be ruined... at least for me, it's been years and I ask myself why she keeps that gift and that she literally told me ""It's one of the most beautiful things someone has done for me,"" she posts things about relationships and so on and also, part of that humor makes me laugh and she has liked things about that that that I share, honestly it stresses me out trying to try to interpret social media signals, but it's what I have, we also interact in Facebook btw.

breakfast was some canned diced peach and pears 8/10. A classic. I just picked a bit at the peach before throwing in the towel. I also had a skim latte that I went down to the hospital cafeteria to get and that was 10/10 (not really a 10, but I'm grateful something that's not instant coffee)

Lunch was Moroccan lamb stew, steamed pumpkin, steamed broccoli, and mashed potato which looked like it would be an 7/10. There was also some apple pie and custard,  but I was really nauseated at that point so I didn't touch anything. Looked like it would have been nice though. Bonus picture of the NG feeds. I am really looking forward to when the evening tea trolly comes around because I'd love a hot Milo. This tube is killing my throat. I'm so glad I managed to convince them to go down to a 10F instead of a 12F. An 8F would have been my favourite, but they said they didn't have any on ward.

I'm so thankful they gave me a menu yesterday. Usually orders for the next day are done the previous morning , so I would have gotten weird things again, but thankfully today's meals are my choice. I feel so childish for being such a fussy eater, like I'm a grown-ass adult I shouldn't hate just about everything at my big age.

I had a customer order a small regular coffee, but there was a bit of confusion on my part. The second window was taking longer than expected with the food orders, and there was a bit of a backup at the first window. Customer 1 (which I thought was the one with the coffee order) mentioned that his wife had already paid through the app. Since I assumed this was the correct order, I told him it was fine and directed him to the second window. However, me being the stupid person I am pressed the exact cash button for a small regular coffee when that wasn't his order and he didn't give the payment (the coffee order was for customer 2 AKA the car behind him). HOWEVER, I misheard customer 2's order and he actually wanted a medium black coffee, so I just redid the order for customer 2. I’m not entirely sure what happened after that. I know I should’ve told someone while I was working but at that moment, I didn't really process what just happened. What should I do? I just want to make sure this doesn’t turn into a bigger issue. I don’t work again until Tuesday, and I really want to avoid any misunderstandings or potential issues with my job.

Thanks in advance for your help and advice!

Located in South East London Herne Hill

The idea is Caribbean food - but fine dining 😅 I'm no where near sophisticated enough for fine dining so I thought it would be good to try.

Starters: 
These were so small haha! We got a saltfish thing and a chicken thing and we literally got 3 bites each 🤣
Never done fine dining before so this was hilarious to us. They did taste nice, just not mind blowing.

Mains:
Babes got this Lobster pasta thing. It literally came with 5 bits of Lobster and 5 pieces of pasta 😂 but omg this was the star of the show for us. Perfectly cooked Lobster - no shell to fight with.

I got the duck dish - it came with a little croquet thing. It was nice but honestly that Lobster is living rent free in my mind right now lol. My only experience with duck has been in Chinese pancakes so this was different. Probably the first time I've actual tasted duck that wasn't drenched in hoisin sauce. 

The sides that stood out for me was the Brussels sprouts, the plantain and the lil roasties. All seasoned and cooked perfectly in my opinion. The Jollof Rice could have been spicier but as a west African dish I was surprised to see it on the menu in the first place.

Next up was the deserts. The apple crumble was brilliant. I would have preferred a higher crumble ratio though. The sticky toffee pudding wasn't my cup of tea strangely enough... They put some coffee flavoured stuff on top and I hate the taste of coffee 😅

Forgot to mention the cocktails were really nice and fruity - not too strong either. The fine dining thing probably isn't for me but definitely an experience. I'd give it an 8/10 as I'm not civilised enough for fine dining😂 I hope to see them open another Resturant with soul food sized portions 😎

Now let’s talk about the star of the show, the pistachio latte.
It is unreal. It’s made from real, authentic pistachios, you can taste the quality immediately. From the pistachio-infused base to the velvety pistachio cream to the pistachio topping sprinkled on top, every sip reminds you that this isn’t just a flavored drink, it’s the real deal. Rich, creamy, nutty, and perfectly balanced. Easily one of the best pistachio lattes in San Diego.

Their pastries are just as phenomenal. The cheese sulgik pastry is soft, flavorful, and comforting. The honeycomb bread pastry is beautifully textured with the perfect hint of sweetness. And the olive mix pastry is savory, unique, and absolutely delicious. Each pastry is crafted with care and feels like a little taste of home.

1pkj9cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazingStories/comments/1pkj9cf/christmas_was_the_only_day_the_house_was_quiet/,Christmas was the only day the house was quiet,"
Growing up, my house was not a peaceful place. It was the kind of chaos people lean in for when you talk about it. Holes punched in walls. Police cars flashing red and blue in the driveway. Fists colliding with noses. Hands tightening around throats until the room went dim at the edges. Tension clung to every surface, as stale and ever-present as the cigarette smoke that yellowed the walls. Long silences followed the shouting. Silences that felt heavier than the violence itself. The constant understanding that one wrong sentence, one poorly timed breath, could fracture everything again.

Except on Christmas. Christmas was different. Somehow, every December 25th, my parents called a truce. It was never announced. There were no apologies exchanged, no promises made. It simply arrived, quiet and fragile, like a ceasefire no one trusted but everyone obeyed. As if both of them woke up and remembered a version of themselves who once wanted a family, and decided to play that role for one full day.


That day felt magical.

I would wake so early not to rush to the tree like all of the other kids. No I would wake with my heart racing, and lie perfectly still in my bed… listening. Not for shouting. Not for the low, dangerous murmurs that meant something was about to explode. But for sounds that meant safety. The clink of coffee cups. The soft hum of Randy Travis’ Christmas album floating through the house. Footsteps that moved without rage in them. Even the air felt warmer, like the walls themselves had decided to rest.


We weren’t rich. The tree was never extravagant. But the number of presents was overwhelming… almost one for every punch thrown that year, as if guilt could be wrapped in shiny paper and stacked beneath pine needles. And I didn’t care. Christmas wasn’t about what was under the tree. It was about what wasn’t in the house.

No bloodshed. No 911 calls. No slammed doors. No bruises blooming by morning. No walking on eggshells so carefully you forget how to stand.

Just peace.

My parents spoke softly to each other, like strangers trying not to ruin a first impression. Their smiles were careful, brittle, like glass ornaments hung too close together. We sat at the table without my stomach knotting in anticipation. We laughed the real laughter, the kind that startled me every time it happened, like I wasn’t sure we were allowed to do that.


As a kid, I lived for that day.


I counted down to Christmas like all kids, but not for the same reasons. Santa wasn’t my favorite part. I treated it like proof that another life was possible. That this, this version of us could exist if everyone just tried hard enough. Every year, I believed maybe this time it would stick. Maybe the peace would last past midnight. Maybe love would outlive the holiday.

It never did.

By December 26th, the magic evaporated. The house slipped back into itself like a bruise darkening. Christmas became sacred because it was rare. Peace became something seasonal. Temporary. Something you learned not to trust.

And then I grew up.

I built a life that looks nothing like the one I came from. I chose calm deliberately. I chose stability with intention. I chose a home where voices don’t rise, where love doesn’t come with conditions, where silence feels safe instead of threatening.


Now, Christmas feels… different.

It’s still warm. Still cozy. Still full of good food and soft lights. But the anticipation doesn’t ache anymore. The desperation is gone. The hope that this one day will save me no longer lives in my chest.

And for a while, that made me sad.

I wondered if I’d lost something. I wondered if I lost that childlike magic people talk about. I wondered why Christmas felt so ordinary in my life now, why it blended into the rest of my peaceful days.

Then it hit me. Christmas feels ordinary because peace is no longer rare.

What once made December 25th shimmer wasn’t the holiday itself it was the contrast. The relief. The way calm felt miraculous because it was borrowed and brief. Now, calm is my baseline. Joy isn’t something I wait for once a year. It’s something I wake up beside.

The magic didn’t disappear. It expanded.

Christmas taught me what peace felt like long before I knew how to name it. It showed me what I deserved before I had the language to ask for it. And maybe that’s why I chased it so fiercely as an adult and why I refused to recreate the chaos I survived.
So now, when Christmas comes, I don’t cling to it like a lifeline. I sit in the quiet I built, and I think gently of that child who listened for safety in the dark.

You were right to love this so much.

It wasn’t just a holiday. It was a promise.

But I have a question about myself and history.

  
Now I have been told / heard rumours that some of the characteristics of the ""known"" or past ""antichrist'"" had a few things in common.

1 of these things in common was the lack of a testicle, thus only having one.  
Now I had mine removed when I was 5, and I was told it was due to a hernia<(is this actually possible to happen or the right information I just kinda question it cause apparently it didn't drop and I used to play baseball so if I got hit in the groin it would have shot up through my body into my stomach and killed me ?) 

Now. I do not support believes of how a certain someone (Adolf Hitler) conducted world war 2, but i do show a interest in the history behind things, i am not a racist, but i have different persepectives on things, 

So Napolean Bonaparte was also a ""antichrist"" and had 1 testicle apparently.

A few days ago, I shared my brain scans before and after coffee, and today I decided to try something different: a quick 15-minute meditation session. 

  
Here’s what I observed: 

  
**Before Meditation:** 

  
\- Elevated levels of high beta and beta waves: I was in an alert and tense state, really thinking hard. 

\- Low alpha waves: It was tough for me to switch into a relaxed state. 

\- Minimal theta activity: My mind wasn’t drifting or softening at all. 

\- In short: My body was still, but my brain was revving like it was in high gear. 

  
**After Meditation:** 

  
\- High beta levels decreased. 

\- Beta waves became less intense. 

\- Alpha waves began to rise (indicating relaxation). 

\- A little bit of theta showed up (suggesting some inward focus and softening). 

\- Overall, my brain shifted from that high-alert mode into something that felt more restful. 

  
While it wasn’t a dramatic change, there was a noticeable physiological difference, which was the main thing I wanted to explore. There’s a wealth of research out there on meditation, but since every brain reacts uniquely, I was keen to check my own results. 

  
**Just to be upfront:** I’m part of the Myndlift team, the app I used for these brain scans. I’m sharing this because I’m genuinely interested and find these experiments fascinating.

I am always free at the time and wake up early and my work doesn't start till 10:30 AM. 

I would like some good locations or outlets to go to alone, for just kind of a walk or maybe get some tea or coffee. 

Starbucks and CCD open at 8 and I have been there a bunch, but it really puts a toll on my wallet going there every weekday. Some nice cozy cafe will also be nice but that is not something I can do all the time. I have seen the hills behind Nath Valley School (near my home), but I am now bored of those places as well.

I am fine with places all around the city as I can just drive there and in the morning, it is little to no traffic almost everywhere.

If anyone has any suggestions, please help me here. I am also not aware if such a question has been asked before.

Bit of additional information: I often sat with these headphones on, but wore them so that only the left cap (the one that still works) was on my ear and the other was just on my head. This is quite convenient because it allows me to hear what is going on in the room.

1pkj0ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pkj0ct/aitah_extremely_long_story_i_recorded_a_meeting_w/,AITAH: (EXTREMELY LONG STORY) I recorded a meeting w my boss and sent it to HR,"Hi guys. 

I(20s,F) work in an office where it’s just me and one other person - the boss(60s,F) although we are part of a large company so my boss didn’t have the power to do things like fire me or write me up

My boss has always had some red flags, but I ignored them because the pay at this job was great and none of her red flags personal affected me (yet). The first one that I should’ve paid attention to was how she wanted to tell me alllll of the drama with her last staff during my initial interview. 

The second red flag was how she basically had a new staff member once a year since she took over the office 7 years ago. 

The third red flag was that every. single. day. This woman would want to beat a dead horse, and tell me how terrible everyone has been to her here and how she always gets screwed over. Literally everyday. She told me things about how she out manipulated them to get them to want to quit because “once you hire someone it’s extremely hard to be able to get rid of them”. She told me countless stories of these people. 

Part of me really believed her because she seemed like such a strong woman and we shared a lot of the same views on things, I really liked her and we started to become pretty close. 

Now, about a month or two into me working here, she told me she thought I’d be a great fit to take over for her in a couple years when she’s retired. I was over the moon about that, thinking my prayers for a career that allowed the opportunity for growth was finally being answered. 

Fast forward to 6 months on the job, I had to call in for the first time due to getting a kidney stone. She seemed sympathetic enough about it and said no problem hope you feel better.

The next couple of months I still have this pain, and it was gradually getting worse and worse and worse. I requested an appointment with my doctor but the soonest they could get me in was a few weeks out. 

Her [third since I’ve been here] week long vacation was coming up soon and this was our busiest month yet. She didn’t really like to give me many tasks because she’s someone that has a hard time of letting go of control and I had to pretty much beg her to let me help more. She praised me for that, and things were going well so far. She actually praised me constantly - telling me that I’m the first staff member that never bothered her while she was gone on her vacations. 

(This part is important) The Friday before her vacation, we got something in the mail that I didn’t think we needed but wanted her to double check. I was a little nervous as she is the type of person who makes you feel like you have to walk on eggshells around, but I go in her office and ask her. She says, (with an annoyed tone) “what do I need this for??? “ I tell her I just need her to double check because I thought we already did this. 

She looks it over, says “yeah this is a duplicate. I’ll take care of it.” 

Now we fast forward to the week of her vacation. It’s Thursday, so her week is almost up. I get a text that says my drs office has a last minute opening and asked if I’d like to come in. I text my boss, she says it’s fine and I go to the dr. 

Long story short (for this part at least) the drs office visit turned into me needing emergency surgery for a now 8mm stone that was causing my kidney to swell. I didn’t get home until 10pm that night and texted her to let her know I couldn’t go in Friday either because I was still recovering from the anesthesia (per drs orders, I even asked them if I could go to work the next day and they said no because the anesthesia would make me weird the next day and boy they were right)

I can tell by my bosses tone over text that she’s annoyed but she said “ok, I’ll go put a sign on the door tomorrow” (letting people know no one would be there until Monday) 

All weekend I was a nervous wreck, not knowing what version of my boss I was going to see but I was trying to stay positive as best as I can. 

Monday rolls around, she rushes in through the door and without even looking at me and goes in her office. I think she tried to say morning but it was mostly under her breath. It was very clear she was frustrated that I wasn’t in on Friday. We had a lot of missed calls. Understandably this isn’t something either of us wanted to be walking into, but my thing is… we can’t control needing emergency surgery lol. 

So things are tense. She is finding anything and everything to be annoyed with me over. Asked me if I had gotten something I was working on done and I said I wanted to wait for her to look it over before submitting it to make sure it was all good (I’m still new… I can’t possibly know everything yet)

I say I’ll go get to work on it and as I’m working on it, I realize the document I asked her about before her vacation is my missing piece. Oops. I nervously go back to her office and say, “heyyy so you remember that document I asked you about before your vacation? Yeah well turns out we do need it still. Any idea where ya put it?”

You would have thought I just pissed in her coffee or something. She went into this fit of rage on how she couldn’t believe I screwed this up, how she honestly had never felt confident in my abilities to do this job, how she “has to be honest” about how she’s been really insecure about me working there because I don’t seem to ever know what I’m doing. News to me because all she ever did before this was thank me for caring about my work there and would tell clients I’m the best person that’s ever sat in this seat. So, the math wasn’t mathing. 

Idk if it was just me being exhausted from not only recovering from the surgery, or from being anxious all weekend to come into work on Monday or a mix of both, but during her rant I started crying and said “can’t you ever give some grace?” And this spiraled into a wholllllllle thing. 

We found the document in her shred bin (doesn’t get shredded til the shred it truck comes) and she basically tells me I should never have to ask her what a piece of mail is for because I should “just know” and said she now questions if she gives me a task, if I’ll be able to get the job done right. I said, “you looked at this same document and also thought we didn’t need it. So can you not do your job either?” That made her so mad she threw the document at my desk and stormed to her office and slammed the door. 
She comes back out and asks “do I need to get HR involved?” I tell her she can do whatever she wants. We don’t end that day on a good note and agree we will have a meeting about it the next morning. 

Something in my gut told me I needed to record the meeting because it’s her word vs. mine. I also live in a one party consent state.  

We start having our meeting and it goes exactly like it did the day before. I pretty much tell her she needs to be accountable for acting poorly towards me too because I already apologized and she refused to. Once she realized the convo was not going the way she thought it would, she starts telling me that I apparently admitted to her that I am giving friends personal client info. I literally laughed and was like what?? She told me it’s because client appointments are confidential here and because I told my fiancé about seeing a mutual friend, that was against the law basically lol. 

I laughed and said “there it is. You’re trying to come up with something to make it seem like you have something on me to make me quit. You’re doing exactly what you did to your last staff members, the stories you personally told me about” and she’s not letting up. 

I said if we’re going to talk about law or policy violations she needed to take a look in the mirror because there’s a ton of that going on up in here 

She said “like what?!” I said “like you sleeping with your clients…” she looked shocked that I’d even say that and goes “that’s none of your business!” I said “well ya tell me about it all the time so I guess it dos kind of make it my business “

She argued this didn’t matter anyways because it’s not against the company policy to do that. 🤣 I said ok. She wanted to go on about me “violating the law” still, so I was like ok - how about the time you forged that document for a client. 

(Back story on that … An elderly client came in wanting to bring some money but he literally was two weeks from his death and couldn’t see. He had a self driving car that took him to our branch all the time lol my boss came in one day, sat me down and told me how no matter what we should never sign stuff for clients because that could get her license taken away and she lost sleep all weekend over it ) 

She instantly goes “you can’t prove that I did “ and then backtracks and says “I got his wife’s approval anyways” and then straight up starts saying actually no I never did any of that. 

I said “if you are going to sit here and tell me that you didn’t come in that day, sit me down & tell me how you lost sleep that whole weekend because of it.. I see exactly the kind of person I’m dealing with right now” 

She kept denying it but then said “I do not fear anything you tell HR about me. “ 

I said, I don’t either. If you go to HR just know I also will have to go to HR to defend myself. So the ball is in your court. She claimed she wasn’t going to but then tried to be sneaky about it and went out to her car for an hour, so I knew exactly what was happening lol. 

I get a call from HR shortly after she came back and went in her office and they tell me they have to open an investigation due to the allegations she was making against me. I said no problem, I have my own evidence for backup. They asked what that was And I let them know it was a voice memo, hour long, of our entire conversation. I let them know I definitely didn’t act the most professionally in it but that things escalated and so when they listen just be prepared lol. 

They get the recording, and I am not sure what exactly happened next, but my boss never came back after that day. 

Part of me feels guilty because maybe I could’ve just ignored her ranting about me being terrible at the job but idk. The other part feels like I got justice for all her past staff members whose lives were made hell by her. 

So…. Reddit. AITAH?

1pkj031,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravesdisease/comments/1pkj031/post_rai_tooth_decay/,Post RAI Tooth decay,"I (F26) was diagnosed with graves this past year and had RAI 7 weeks ago. I don’t remember the exact dosage but I do know it was a lower dose. My endo said it would go into my bone marrow. Well I had a teeth cleaning a few weeks ago where they found a cavity as well as potential other ones. (I’ve had 2 babies back to back with my youngest being only 18 mo. and since then I have easily gotten cavities and my teeth have been extremely sensitive) 
So I was upset to find out I had yet another one. But today I went in to have it filled and he told me I had several more all over my teeth trying to come up and I was so confused as I brush 2 a day and floss at least 1 a day. I do not smoke or drink and am only down to 1 cup of coffee a day thanks to my heart palpitations (I currently have radiation thyroiditis post RAI btw). So after my appt I looked in the mirror at my last upper left tooth looking for where he said another one was coming in only to find that tooth black!! I thought it was a stain but the more I have looked and shone a brighter light it looks like my entire tooth is decayed. My dentist is older and it’s def time for him to retire. I even mentioned about my recent RAI and I guess he just didn’t see it??? I called back and they blew me off saying if he said “well just watch it” then I don’t need to worry. But my tooth was not rotted like this a few days ago! 

Has anyone else suffered rapid tooth decay post RAI??? Naturally, thanks to my graves, I resort to the worst possible scenario but literally what am I going to do if all of mt teeth start decaying !! ",1,1765514392.0,gravesdisease,5,1.0,False

I was just about to close up shop—turn off the lights, maybe catch a movie—when she walked in.

The Craving.

She looked good. I’ll give her that. She was wearing that red dress she knows I like—the one made of ""Stress Relief"" and ""Just One Won't Hurt."" She smelled like trouble and menthol.

She sat down in the chair opposite my desk, crossed her legs, and started crying. It was a good performance. Academy Award stuff.

""It's a disaster, detective,"" she sobbed, dabbing her eyes with a lace handkerchief. ""The whole city is falling apart without you. The coffee tastes terrible. The drive to work is lonely. The stress is gonna kill us both if we don't do something *tonight*.""

She leaned forward, putting a hand on my arm. Her grip was tight.
""We were a team, baby. Remember? Bonnie and Clyde. We need to get the old gang back together. Just for one night. Just to take the edge off.""

I looked at her. Really looked at her.

And for a second, the old instinct kicked in. The urge to be the hero. The urge to fix her problem. The urge to reach into the drawer for the lighter.

But then, I noticed the details.

I noticed the run in her stocking.
I noticed the cheap, desperate glint in her eye.
I noticed that she wasn't looking at me with love. She was looking at me like a mark.

She wasn't a damsel in distress. She was a grifter. And she was running the same con she’d run on me a thousand times before.

I didn't say a word.
I just opened my desk drawer.

Her eyes lit up. She thought I was reaching for the pack. She thought she had me.

Instead, I pulled out a stapler. And a file folder marked **""CLOSED CASES.""**

I picked up the file from the desk—the file labeled ""US""—and I stapled it shut.
*Ka-CHUNK.*
The sound was loud in the quiet office.

She froze. The tears stopped instantly. The mask dropped.
""What do you think you're doing?"" she hissed, her voice suddenly sharp and ugly.

I stood up and put on my hat.
""I'm retiring, sweetheart,"" I said, walking to the door. ""And you're trespassing.""

I flipped the light switch. The office went dark.
""You can let yourself out. But don't steal the stapler. That's company property.""

I walked out into the rain.
And for the first time in twenty years...
I didn't offer her my umbrella.

She screamed my name from the window.
I kept walking.

I work a stable job in the public sector that keeps me busy with shift work, but I’m currently focused on pivoting into the tech industry (aiming for a Computer Science degree soon).

I’m in a ""building phase"" of my life—focused on my career, financial stability, and personal growth. I’m proud of where I’m at, but I’m missing that one person to share the downtime with.

# Who I Am

The Vibe: I’m calm, logical, and pretty laid back. I’m the kind of person who stays cool under pressure—which helps with my job! I value deep one-on-one conversations over loud, crowded parties.

The Routine: Because of my shifts, I’m sometimes up early or working late. I’m looking for someone who understands that my schedule isn't always a standard 9-5.

Interests: My music is all over the place—Desi hip-hop, Alt-Pop, Bollywood, and random stuff in between. I keep my brain sharp with logic puzzles, and I’m a firm believer that a hot bowl of Maggi is the ultimate comfort food after a long day.

Personality: My friends usually treat me as their ""tech support"" or life advisor when they get stuck. I’m a good listener, I’m loyal, and I’m very comfortable with silence.

# What I’m Looking For

I’m looking for a serious, Long-Term Relationship. I want to meet someone who is:

**Authentic**: No games, just clear communication.

Independent: You have your own goals and life, and you’re looking for a partner to complement that, not complete it.

**Low Key**: You enjoy simple dates—grabbing coffee, a late-night drive, or just hanging out.

**Understanding**: You get that shift work is a lifestyle and are cool with a partner who is working hard to build a future.

If you’re someone who values loyalty and wants to build something real, shoot me a message. Tell me your favorite comfort food or the last song you listened to.",2,1765514074.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,0.75,False

So when I heard TJ carrying kouign amann, I had to get them to try. Unfortunately they were sold out at my last two visit, I finally went in early morning and was able to grab them. It was $5.49 and there are four inside.

I've tried keto but it very hard to know which vegetable agree with me. A lot don't. I'm gluten sensitive as well.  So I decided after watching tons of carnevoure utubes that is ease into a meat only diet.  I've done my first week.  Though I've had to make sure my fat content stays good, I learned that too much (like yummy butter in my morning coffee) sends me running down the hall. 
But... and here it is..I have veeery little digestive disorder and I feel energetic and brilliant,  and I've lost 10 lb. this week (mostly water but still). That's my first week!!! I do have to drink my electrolyte shakes with potassium and magnesium regularly or I feel weak.  Apparently that's part of the carnivore flu that is natural during the first few weeks.  I eat eggs, steak, hamburger,  some chicken wings, and some fish.. sardines mostly.  I only eat a small amount of cheese. 
I would highly suggest you being very serious about checking out going carnevoure.  There's some amazing health utubes about people who do carnevoure and improve their health in amazing ways.

Anyway just wanted to ask, what have you been enjoying lately in body care? Maybe someone will get some inspo. 

##What I’ve Been Enjoying Lately

Recently I’ve been liking:
* Milk Bar Raspberry Holiday Pie Bar - so very winter holiday treat to me. Have gone on about this one—big fan. 
* Milk Bar Cereal Milk Soft Serve - i initially thought who would want to smell like cereal milk. But I retried it this week and actually like the milk note. 
* Grandma’s Fruitcake - also a toasty fragrance like the two above. Don’t really like fruitcake. But why do I kind of like smelling like it? Personally I think it’s a bit similar to Cereal Milk Soft Serve
* Midnight Addiction - also a revisit. If it has coffee notes, it’s like a very watery coffee. I kind of like how smooth it smells. 
* Zodiac collection - actually like a lot of these. Want to smell them again. I think there are some good aquatics. Leo is interesting to me because (i think, not sure) it has like a spicy note like Inner Angel maybe, which BBW doesn’t do a lot of so I’m into it. I have rather like Inner Angel this fall. 
* Heirloom Rose - just a nice spring rose scent, very fresh
* Apres All Day - I’m into it, I like peony. I think it might be strong like Heirloom Rose. Also a fresh floral type of scent. But here with like a cashmere creamy or powdery musk element. If you like Heirloom Rose or Rose, I think chances are good you might like Apres All Day.

Hi everyone! Quick update in case it helps someone.
I’ve been on KIT 1 for 1 month and 10 days and I’m down almost 9 lbs.
Side effects:
The first weeks were rough, nausea, headaches, dizziness, burping, and food noise jumping up and down. Taking meds without food or with coffee made everything worse.
But around week 5–6 everything finally calmed down:
almost no nausea,
no headaches,
burping is gone 🙌

dizziness only for a second sometimes,

food noise quiet, appetite normal.

Coffee doesn’t sit well anymore,can’t even finish a cup.
Food stuff:
I feel hunger but get full fast.
 No mindless snacking, no sugar cravings, sweets just sit untouched.
 I often don’t finish my portions and it feels natural.
Overall:
I finally feel good on it. Side effects faded, appetite is under control, and the whole thing feels stable now.
Hope this helps someone in the early rough phase,it can get better! 💛

I thought I was over it, but I just saw on Instagram that he already has a new girlfriend and it broke me in a way I didn’t expect.

When we first met, he had nothing. He had quit his job, was unemployed, and later didn’t even have money for school. Out of love, I paid his tuition with the savings from my part-time job. That was a huge deal for me, but he ended up dropping out and never paid me back. I also gave him money for dental work, paid for most of our dates, and planned everything because he never really took initiative.

About a year in, I caught him messaging other girls. I was devastated but gave him another chance… then another. He cheated on me multiple times — whether it was dating apps, flirty texts, or late night messages from random women. I really tried making it work with him, but he just kept disappointing me and abusing my trust.

Despite all of that, I kept trying to support him. I let him use my car for his driving test (he scratched it, and the mark is still there). I helped him with his résumé, which he copied directly from mine and even lied on. He finally got a job once, but got let go in less than 3 months. Even when he was working, he never tried to pay me back. Instead, he lived off government money, and when that ran out, he’d lash out at me.

I broke up with him once before but went back when he called. That became our cycle. And even when things were “good,” he never gave me anything back. I spent thousands on hotels, food, concerts, and birthdays. He never got me a birthday gift. Meanwhile, I was taking him to steak dinners and booking nice hotel rooms for his.

Last year, I got pregnant. He promised he’d work two jobs if I kept the baby, but I knew he couldn’t provide. I made the painful decision to have an abortion. It broke me, but I knew bringing a child into that situation would’ve destroyed me and he wouldn’t be able to support me at all. I know I’d feel financially stressed.

This past December, I found out he was still cheating and in January he was on a dating app, and that was the final straw. I ended it in February. For months he blew up my phone and email with long, emotional apologies saying I was the love of his life. But after so many betrayals, I couldn’t take him seriously. In June, I sent my last email where I told him he was dead to me, and then I blocked him everywhere. He also sent me another email late June saying that if the tables have turned, he would be open to talking to me and pretty much talked a lot shit about me. He also sent me one last email he saying good luck with sleeping with countless men until I find my person and pretty much talked about alot shit.

In September, I stalked his Instagram. He’s already in a new relationship, posting happy date pictures. And it crushed me. Instead of working on himself, fixing his life, or even taking time to reflect, or improving himself to prove to me that he’s worthy of me..he just jumped into something new.

When I left him, I felt free,  like a huge weight off my chest. I focused on myself, my hobbies, and my career. I thought I was doing well. But seeing him move on so quickly has reopened everything I tried to bury.

He still owes me about $4,000. I’ll probably never get back. I gave him years of my life, my savings, and my love and all I got in return was heartbreak. His family even told me I was the best thing that ever happened to him, and maybe I was. But he definitely wasn’t the best thing for me.

I know he doesn’t deserve me, but it still hurts. I hate that I miss him sometimes, after everything he put me through.

Recently, I made a video to expresses my feelings and pretty much told him my side of the story and it was around 30 mins. I emailed it to him which he watched and he ended up emailing me back. If you want to see it, you can dm me. Tbh, his response isn’t very sincere and asked to meet for coffee. As much as I want to say yes, I declined him.

It was his birthday recently and I wished him happy birthday. I know I shouldn’t but couldn’t help it. I still love and miss him and I hate that I do. I wish I can feel nothing about him but that’s not the case.",5,1765513308.0,Advice,9,0.78,False
1pkineh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1pkineh/losing_my_mind_from_67pm/,Losing my mind from 6-7pm,"This isn’t the usual ‘mental load’ post. I’ve been there and I’ve had that problem, too. But this is something different and I’m hoping someone has some good ideas for me.

Basically most nights between the hours of at least 6PM-7PM but sometimes 5:30PM to 7:30 PM, I just basically get extremely irritated and short with my 6yo kid. I’m very affectionate and loving the rest of the day, pretty chill and don’t freak out too much (I mean at least it’s not too noticeable). He’s a happy kid, very energetic, talks a lot, can make a lot of noise but he’s generally extremely agreeable and also very good. Strong willed, but not naughty.

I used to think it was the dinner/mental load thing, but tonight I had dinner all taken care of and honestly my kid was being…fine. Just playing. And I was just so overly annoyed with him, so irritated, so desperate to get him to bed. Every second he dragged his feet (taking too long to do something, taking a while and playing/dancing before he gets in the shower, forgetting he had to come back in the bathroom and brush his teeth..) I was just like, vibrating with anger. I snapped at him and just kept telling him to stop talking and do what he was supposed to do. It’s like a combination of rage and hopelessness. 

I feel like (? Maybe?) it has something to do with my body fearing how bed time is going to go (he drags it out, but sometimes he’s okay). Or if there’s something in his mood/demeanor that tells me “tonight is going to be a long one”, like as in maybe he will take forever to go to bed. Often as we cruise into bedtime, my behavior/feelings will get better, and we can end on a nice note, which is why I say the cycle usually ends at 7. If he will settle nicely and read a story with me, I am happy. If he is bouncing off the walls, good chance I am EXTREMELY irritated. 

I find it happens to me way less when I am solo parenting (husband working late, etc). Which seems weird.

I don’t feel like I objectively have that much for mental load. He is my only child, my husband is generally helpful and supportive, I work part time and have time off, and my son doesn’t come home until 4:30pm. Between 4:30-6 (usually) i’m able to be a really good mother, we do homework together and play and everything is fine. Mornings are fine as well, and lots (but not all) weekend days. I do frequently have this feeling on Saturdays too.

I just can’t tell what’s happening at that time almost daily. I don’t take any medications that could be wearing off. I drink morning coffee but not even every day. I love my son so much and I hate the feeling of him finally falling asleep, and me thinking “I really didn’t get to enjoy bedtime,” or “I shouldn’t have said that to him” or “he was just playing and being a kid”. 

Has anyone experienced this? Am I just a snowflake and he’s a normal happy boy? ",7,1765513299.0,Mommit,2,1.0,False
