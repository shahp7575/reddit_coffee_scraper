1got0xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1got0xs/passed_tatat/,Passed T/AT/AT,"Hi everyone!

Last week I passed my exam on first attempt. I will share my studying and exam experience below. But first and foremost I want to share my gratitude to this community. I learned that when preparing for such extensive certification it is vital to have a space to discuss you struggles and opinions. Thanks to everyone who pitched in! Now to my journey.

**Content I used:**

* [DM Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/108qAE3@SdKFqjvgTI-kjVemma7EtMl4dyyGYv6kWmLP4ARLCsUJSqhue9dZkEFXK-0Gj_WBzw==/) to get my PDUs (and learn!)
* PMI Study Hall extended subscription: 
   * I did 4 mock exams (4th and 5th are more difficult, be aware and don't be discouraged if you get lower score on those), all mini-exams and practice questions.
   * Recommend trying the Sample Pearson VUE test (it's in the beginning of your SH Learning Plan) to see and touch the exam interface. It looks (and works) like it's on Windows 95, so it's best to know it before the actual exam. Otherwise you may cringe very hard during the precious exam time. Cringe in advance and save exam time!
* Additional[ exam pack on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/101wrE3@BZXbCERaCNAj-aGh32NQiY-XBPQWpQzueD1x_IZMGdNx0sgCBg9EJrEE1Z49qtlmsQ==/):
   * I didn't finish it, and though it was the highest rated exam pack on Udemy, I found some of the questions badly written. But it'll do it you need additional stuff to practice on and you ran out of SH material (like I did).
* Youtube:
   * AR: especially his [""Ultra Hard questions"" series](https://youtu.be/BUxNV-QmQws?si=9GYeLOEHJCNwLRTR), they are perfect to tune in the mindset. Watched them last days before the exam to get the brain juices flowing.
   * DM: [150 PMBoK 7](https://youtu.be/Zht0-j03NfQ?si=cNVK1wEAo7KwapFK) and [200 Agile](https://youtu.be/tNIHysh2ZW4?si=7D20LOC4ZBw5SVG0)
   * Content on my native language (russian) from [this author](https://www.youtube.com/@Selihovkin).
* **Miro:** I did mindmaps with the info I've learned. Highly recommend doing that! It helps especially with things like ITTOs and algorithms, but not limited to!

**Studying:**

* It took me around 6-8 month of dedicated time to prep. I studied 5 times a week for couple hours. It can be done faster, but I was aimed not only to pass, but also to actually extend my knowledge, so I took more time so that information really stuck with me for good. I took vacations from prep as well when I felt demoralised or tired. Time could also be reduced knowing the exam scoring system, more on that below.
* **The most important plot twist for me was the scoring system of the exam:** from some of the materials I've learned that I need to have an appx. 75% on my practice to go for the actual exam. ***THIS IS FALSE!*** **If you ever hear any specific target score – ignore it.** I started to lose hope cause I couldn't hit that (false) goal never mind how hard I tried, up until I found this community. Here I learned that people did pass having around 60% on the practice (and sometimes lower!). If I knew, I would save myself a couple of months of studying. Well oh well! Research this subreddit on ""exam score"", it's very helpful.
* **The exam:**
   * **Online vs. Offline:** I was preparing to do it online, but last minute I changed my mind and went for a test center. I did it cause there are less distracting factors for me + that way I *transferred some of the risks* (the joke for those who knows risk strategies lol) on the testing center. Like having bad connection or doing something that doesn't comply with online exam requirements. No regrets! I visited the test center 2 days before the exam, recommend doing that. There was only 3 slots for November, so I recommend booking it in advance.
   * **Language:** I chose to attempt the exam in my native language even though I was studying in English (and I have C1 level). Here and there I needed translation when studying: some of the words have a very subtle difference (which can make *all* the difference in the question IYKYK). On the exam I did use mostly english, but I checked some of the words for translations just in case. Translations to my native language also helped when I was tired and was losing focus. So it's a good safe option to have. The only inconvenience are the drag'n'drop questions: english translation is basically a screenshot, so you need to jump between languages *a lot* on these to make your choices – it extends your time on the question and is indeed annoying. But there are not that many drag'n'drops so it's not critical.
   * **Exam difficulty:** my exam felt hard. Some of the scenarios had all bad or all good options. So I tried to follow the mindset of ""choosing the best of these"". I took all my breaks and actually was pretty discouraged along the way, I wasn't sure *at all* that I will pass. I did my best to try and just focus on resolving the questions (it was mentally really hard especially after yet another weird and difficult question). I didn't get any math questions and drag'n'drops were relatively easy. Nonetheless I passed with T/AT/AT, so maybe it just *felt harder* than it actually was.
   * **Test center:** My test center (in Krakow) was fairly comfortable, they had snacks/coffee/tea/juices etc. I still had my snacks with me but that was a comforting thing, hopefully all centers have that :3

As this journey comes to an end, I look back and think that key things you need to have are:

* *Community*: like this one here or maybe a studying group as well, it's way harder to do it alone. Up until late October I was alone and I was often demoralised and lost. I took my exam a week after I found this community – reading about different experiences gave me a huge motivation boost.
* *Consistency*: show up regularly, be disciplined about it. Even 20 minutes per day will make a difference.
* *Rest*: take breaks, let you brain process new info (there's *so much* of it!).

Good luck everyone! You got this!

1gosyfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hellenism/comments/1gosyfh/how_to_trust_my_intuition/,How to trust my intuition,"Hello there! So, TLDR is as the title states, in case you want to skip over my ramblings.

I experienced a lot of gaslighting and invalidation of my emotions and feelings as a child growing up in a catholic home. It's led me to doubting or questioning myself and trying to find ""logical"" (at least by my parent's view) explanation for things. Because of this, I worry that I ""reach"" for signs that aren't really there and I'm not sure how to just sit back, listen, and trust.

I've noticed an overwhelming increase on my fyp on tiktok (I know this may cause discourse, and I apologize in advance) of videos of people speaking about being assembled, specifically by Apollo and Hermes, especially in the face of the recent election within the US (something that I, like many, have had extremely emotional responses to).

I confided in my wife that the past year or so I've felt especially drawn toward Apollo and thought it odd that I was seeing all these videos claiming similar feelings, but I fell back on old habits and tried to justify/blame my feelings on the Percy Jackson series releasing (which reignited my love for the book series) or the Epic musical. My wife encouraged me to set up space on our altar (we've both been openly pagan most of our marriage) for Apollo  or do work under him; I told them that I would think on it.

The next morning, I woke up early to grab coffee and a few things from the store before work. While waiting for our coffee, I was killing time just looking out the window and noticed a large delivery truck for some alcohol brand and noticed the word ""SUN"" (in all capital letters) as part of the branding. I get our coffee and head to the grocery store and notice another delivery truck in the gas station next to the store with the word ""Gold"" on it parked next to the brightest yellow truck I think I've ever seen. I also passed right by the first truck (SUN) as I pulled into the grocery store.

I told my wife about these and they suggested that they might be signs and commented that it was the sunniest it had been all week since the election (every day since last Tuesday had been so dark and dreary). I so desperately want to believe that they could be signs, but I can't quiet that voice ingrained in me from childhood that I'm just reaching and clinging to coincidences.

**Coworker asked me to be her man of honor. I said no and she went nuts. What did I miss?**

&#x200B;

This happen yesterday and I'm still confused.

Yesterday was my first day back to work after being off for two weeks. This is kinda important. One of my coworkers had gotten engaged the week before I left. When she announced at work we all did the congratulations and happy for her type of things. I thought it was over. So when I left for vacation the last I knew no plans had yet been made. Then yesterday when I went back to work my boss Kelly  and best friend Laura said that coworker Claire was looking for me. I asked what was up and they weren't sure but she was carrying a little gift bag.

A few minutes later Claire found me and asked how my vacation was. I was telling them about it and she cut me off and said she had a very important question to ask. She handed a little gift bag and asked if I would be her best man of honor for her wedding. I thanked her and told her that typically this would traditionally go to a close female relationship. She responded that there was nothing traditional about her wedding so it was good. I looked over at Laura and Kelly  who were both trying to keep from laughing. I again thanked her congratulated her and told her that I wasn't interested in being part of her wedding party and that I would be happier being a guest in the audience.

I swear when I said this it was when we watched her entire demeanor changed and a switch flipped. She went off saying that I have to be in her wedding and that she doesn't understand why I would say no. I told her that we only knew each other for a short time and that I had no interest in trying to plan parties, dinners, and shopping trips. She told me I needed to think about it and she would get back to me later. I told her go for it but my answer will be the same.

She walked away and I looked at Kelly  and Laura and asked what the ever loving fresh creepy hell was that??? Kelly  started to laugh and said she didn't know. But saying no like I did might have saved me a lot of headaches in the future. Laura made the comment that she went straight to bridezilla and this was a look into what she was going to be like.

Claire came back today however she went with a different approach and handed me a list of what she wants me to do and her vision of how she sees things. I asked her why she gave me this and she said that as her man of honor these were my responsibilities. I told her again that I was not going to do any of this. She started again that she needs me to do this and ""How much fun it was going to be."" Then she asked ""Haven't you ever wanted to be part of something special?"" I told her I was. I was a nurse. Enter Kelly  who could sense that I needed help and told Claire one of her patients needed her help. I told Kelly  that if this keeps up I might need her help. She said she was already watching it and and would intervene if I needed it.

What did I miss??? We aren't that close. She just transferred down to my unit from a different unit six months ago. I had no idea who she was until that point. Laura is saying that she is close in age to me and she might feel that to be enough of a connection. Did I miss something??? When we are asked are we supposed to automatically gush and jump up and down in excitement? Why is saying No a bad thing?

*It sounds like she has no one else in her life and you being around her age and nice to her was enough to give you the “honor.” Stay firm and don’t give in.*

*Also from your post history I assume (correct me if I’m wrong) you’re a gay man? Could she be putting a lot of weird stereotypes into play and trying to make you her “gay best friend” & wedding planner?*

&#x200B;

**the\_show\_must\_go\_onn**

*This was exactly what my mind went to. She wants to be cool by having a gay ""best friend"".*

**Update - 1 day later**

&#x200B;

Hey everyone.

First I apologize.  I never thought this was going to go as crazy as it did.  I want all of you to know I read all of your responses and responded to as many as I was able to.  Thank you all for your amazing insights and comments.  Many that made me laugh.  Which I needed.  I have been sick and that really helped to cheer me up.

I had to meet with my lawyer today regarding family issues.  My neighbor/best friend/coworker Laura took me.  I really felt awful and driving wasn’t a good idea.  We were talking about this on the way and we both were asking a lot of the same questions that all you were asking. The big one was that we were asking about the circumstances of her transfer.  She went from Med Surge 4W to the ER.  That is a huge change.  I have to work tomorrow so we will see what happens.  But Laura and I are going to ask Kelly  about the transfer and raise a couple of other concerns. After I got home from the meeting with my lawyer I slept for the rest of the day.

Many of you asked about if Claire and I hang out outside of work.  The answer is no.  I really don’t know anything about her.  I have helped her a few times with patients and different things.  But our relationship is 100% purely work related. That was why I was so surprised that she asked me to do this. That is why I was so surprised that she asked me about being the Man of Honor. I have a very small friend base and in all honesty I like to keep it that way.

I really have no interest in being a part of this.  I’m not a wedding person.  After reading so many Bridezilla stories and hearing about over the top weddings they have become a huge turn off to me spending tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars with insane unrealistic demands that turn people against each other.   Why???? I would rather use that money and spend that time planning my next trip or vacation.

Many people said that I was being used as a token or prop in a wedding. Or a gay Best Friend.  I never really thought about it.  I admit that I’m out and proud. But I’m not going to just pretend to be someone friend just so they can fulfill some kind of fetish they have for wanting to have a gay best friend or some kind of status she feels the need to fulfill.  It takes me a lot to get offended but if this were actually the case then I would really be rather offended.  I was not put on the face of the Earth to be someones play toy.

A lot of people have said that maybe she doesn’t have a boyfriend.  She does. She has brought him in before.  If she has any insecurity I don’t understand it.  She is attractive, smart and knows he stuff.  So I’m at a loss as to why she is acting like this.

A lot of people say go to HR.  I’m starting that process with my boss Kelly . She is completely aware of the situation being with us when all this happen.  She has told me that she is watching the situation and will jump in if I need her to. I trust her completely.  While Kelly  and HR can control the situation from the hospital they can’t control the situation from a personal level if she were to maybe follow me home or a situation like that.

So I think that covers it all. I wish I could say this is over.  But most likely there is more to come.  Set your update me.

*I really hope you can figure out what she thinks she's trying to do and escape the situation unscathed. From the way you said she acted, this may be a thing where one of you has to leave the department you work for. I hope it doesn't come to that.*

*I don't blame you for not wanting to be around people and their wedding BS. I feel the same way. And it seems like, in America at least, people are getting worse and worse.*

*Best of luck to you, and I can't wait to see your next update.*

*I wonder if all her friends said no. Or if she doesn't have as many as she's says.*

*Her fiance has a best woman and she feels threatened by that.*

**Update - 2 days later**

&#x200B;

I keep forgetting to thank my boyfriend. He has been with me on this but more in the background. First when we were laughing about it. But when everything Thursday happen he was there as well. Laura was able to get him away from his unit for a little bit for the it will be okay boyfriend hug. He stayed the night with me a couple of nights as well also helping with me being sick. So yeah. I'm very lucky to have such a great support.

This intro is going to be long, but I’m telling you about this for a reason and later in this update it will make sense.  I'm hoping this will be done and that this will be the last of this whole situation.

I was born into a family where I was referred to as “An issue that needed to be dealt with” I lived in the shadows of my sister who was the child my parents wanted.  They wanted one child which was a girl.  That way Dad had his daddy girl and mom had mommy little princess.  Then I came along.  Keep in mind that I’m 23 so back then my parents had options but chose to not use any of those options.  So instead my parents raised my sister and I was raised by a nanny who even to this day is one of the biggest influences in my life and I am so grateful for her.  She helped me with so much. I finally realized that all these years later that by being referred to as “An issue that needed to be dealt with” that they stripped me of my humanity and individuality and self- worth as a person.  I think that’s why I have worked so hard to establish myself in my career and in my life.  As a way to become a person again and not just be that issue that needed to be dealt with.

This past Thursday things came to a head with the Bridezilla known as Claire and the truth came out.  My best friend Laura has been sticking close to me when we work together if Claire was to start something.  We weren’t sure if she was going to leave it alone or start up again.  I was really hoping that it was done.  But she had to try once again. I’ve been sick and I had a busy morning so I really just wanted a few minutes to go to the bathroom, grab a quick snack and maybe breath??? Claire came up and had her list and asked if I had a few minutes to talk about the wedding planning.  I looked at her and told her again no that I was not interested in being part of her wedding and that I was not going to help in anyway and she needed to drop the subject and leave me alone.  Again she went into the who thing of how I was going to do this and how much fun it was going to be.  Here we go with that line all of you loved the first time.  “Why in the ever loving fresh creepy hell is it so important for me to be your Man of Honor? I’m not interested and I’m not doing it.”

It is as exactly as pretty much all of you told me it would be.  She was just planning on using me as a token or a play toy.  She took all of the fucked up gay stereo types that are out in society and put them into one sentence. “What modern liberal women isn’t going to have a Gay Bestie on her arm for special events?”

I felt everything in my stomach move and a wave of nausea come over me and I felt like I couldn’t get to the bathroom fast enough. This pissed Laura off to no end.  Laura is really kinda like the over protective sister that I wish I would have had and took Claire off to visit our boss Kelly  and laid it all out.  Everything that was said. While I wasn’t in on that conversation Laura and Kelly  filled me in on what was said.  Kelly  came to check on me and I was still hiding in the bathroom She knocked on the door and asked if she could come in.  I asked her for a bottle of water first.

While I was waiting I realized two things.  I realized why I chose to not hang out with her and why didn’t like her.  I couldn’t figure out why I didn’t like her just that there was something that gave me the heebeegeebees. But I realized that I didn’t like her because she is a different version of my sister. While Claire is educated and employed she doesn’t care about other people and their feelings.  She is like my sister in the sense that if she wants something bad enough she will figure out how to get it.  The second thing I realized was that she did exactly what my parents did to me.  She completely dehumanized me and reduced me to an entity.  Just kinda turned me into a token or a thing for her.  I think the word that best describes it is I’m must a play toy. What really gets me is that just like my sister Claire doesn’t think she did anything wrong and I’m being too sensitive and a delicate snowflake.

The next day an emergency meeting was held at work and Claire is being suspended pending investigation and a new transfer is being looked into. Kelly  made the request for her to be terminated. The Director of Emergency Nursing said this was a last resort but she was going to be looking into options which could be sending her to a new hospital or facility. This didn't go over well with me. I asked what would happen if she did the exact same thing to someone different? She didn't really give me an answer. But she said she still needs to look into a few things and at this point she is suspended.

Anyway. Here it is. I'm still pretty sick and had to work this weekend. If I can I'll respond. I want to thank everyone for all the amazing support. I am going back to my lawyer to see if he can figure out how to send her a Cease and Desist letter to make sure she doesn't contact me. I'm heading to bed. Have a good night!!!

Hi Everyone.

First I apologize for not responding sooner.   I have always tried to do what I can to stay engaged with all of you and to respond as often as possible.  Truth of the matter is that I hit a brick wall.  Between everything with my parents, being sick and then the Bridezilla I just kinda lost all my motivation to keep the conversation going.  But I will say this.  I read all of your comments everyone one of them and there are not enough words in any language to say thank you for all the amazing support, feedback and suggestions. I am truly grateful for everything all of you brought to the table.

I went back to my lawyer the other day and told him everything.  I told him I only had her name but I did not have her address and since he has resources that I don’t I wanted him to find her and send her a Cease and Desist letter to not contact me. He was looking into this.

The good news.  Claire has been terminated.  While I am not able to talk about all of the details, I can say that this goes a lot deeper than what she did to me and after Kelly  did some digging it brought out some information that could have put our hospital in a serious position.   When this information was brought out in the open it gave the Director of Emergency Nursing (DEN) no choice but to terminate her and it could put the DEN in a serious position as well. Honestly it has Kelly , Laura and myself looking at potentially looking for new jobs if this doesn’t get properly corrected. None of us want to change hospitals, because then we have to start all over with seniority, and benefits. It's a last resort, but it's still something to consider.

I guess I can say that this is closed.  At least I hope it is.  I need to move on with my life.  I doubt that Claire will be dumb enough to contact me.  She is in enough trouble and this would only make it worse.  Again I apologize for not being able to keep up with responding back to all of your comments, but again.  I can assure you that I read all of them and value all of them as well.  Thank you again for the amazing support!!!

**WIBTAH if I drop out of a friends wedding after not being invited to the bachelorette**

&#x200B;

Hi! So I 25F am currently being pushed back and forth with my choice and I thought the lovely people of Reddit might be able to rein me in

i am currently 13 weeks pregnant and my friends around me have all been very happy and excited for me, however my childhood friend 25F, let’s call her Lisa. Stonewalled me since I announced at 8 weeks, I had assumed it was wedding stress but now I’m seconding guessing this.

In the weekend I was scrolling instagram and I came across a post where she had thanked everyone for coming to her bachelorette, photos of it’s the girls and her smiling in the middle and I sorta sat there shocked. At first I tried to be mature and just let it go… but this was a girl I grew up with, she was a bridesmaid in my wedding party and I’m a honorary bridesmaid for hers ( she’s not having a wedding party )

In the end I guess hormones took over and I ended up reaching out to her, at first I went “ oh looks like fun! “ and she replied that it was and after a tub of ice cream and a good sob I reached out and went “ hey, uh sorry to be this person but why wasn’t I invited? “

She immediately messaged me back with the response: “ Tbh the whole day was centred around drinking (wineries and heading to town after) and im not sure you would have enjoyed being around all of us drunk af especially cause your pregnant right now. I get that an invite would have been nice regardless, but in all honestly I just wanted to keep it very small. I’m really sorry you feel that way, but I don’t want to make this a big thing bc I’ve already had a shit week “

I tried to respond with hey thanks for getting back to me but I’m still upset cause the day is about you and I wanted to be there to celebrate you and then she rung me and just asked me to not make this a big thing once again and she sounded incredibly annoyed and like the door mat I am I dropped it

after thinking this over for the past few days I’m feeling very hurt and heartbroken, this was a girl I grew up with and loved and supported through a lot of shit, I’ve helped her plan and prepare a lot of her wedding so to suddenly get iced out like this I’m feeling a certain way.

my husband suggests we don’t go and I’m on the edge, so Reddit WIBTAH if I declined going to her wedding and distancing myself?

*NTA. Her saying “don’t make this a big thing” would piss me off. If you guys are close then she 100% should have at least invited you. The whole it’s my wedding and I can invite and do what I want is true, however that doesn’t mean you have no consequences for your decisions.*

*To me she doesn’t consider you as good of a friend as you may think.*

&#x200B;

**Beneficial-Year-one**

*“I’m a honorary bridesmaid for hers ( she’s not having a wedding party )” What the heck is this. is it a new fad I haven’t heard of or a way to get more partying and gifts from your friends without having them in the wedding ? in any case WNBTA for ghosting her wedding. She deliberately did something that she knew would hurt your feelings and told you not to make a big thing out of it*

&#x200B;

**Temporary-Tie-233**

*I'd say there's a good chance she is lying about not having a bridal party and that will be another cruel surprise for OP if she attends.*

*NTA OP. This friendship might have run its course. That might make you sad because change is hard, but dropping her so you can focus on real friendships will be a win in the long run.*

**Update - 1 days later**

&#x200B;

Hi! Hope this is allowed but you were all so wonderful and helpful and turns out I got an update sooner then I expected

so I haven’t heard from Lisa, that I expected

what I didn’t expect is a friend of Lisa to get in touch with me, let’s call her Sarah, I knew of Sarah and spoke to her a few times at events we attended together and she was one of the girls with myself went wedding dress shopping for Lisa, she was also a friend I noticed wasn’t at the bachelorette which was a surprise anyway and at first she was doing a “ hey how are you “ and we did polite small talk blah blah until she finally went “ so are you as pissed off and mad as I am at Lisa OP? “

Immediately I was slightly shocked as the few times I had met Sarah she was very I guess demure?

That opened the floodgates of information and she told me everything she knows, so what I didn’t put in the post is I actually waited 2 days before messaging Lisa about the lack of invite… turns out 3 of Lisa’s friends who also weren’t invited hit her up immediately after she posted on instagram asking why they weren’t invited

turns out these girls absolutely chewed Lisa alive and my “ confrontational “ was soft and finally it was revealed what actually happened and now I’m even more confused

so Lisa admitted to Sarah that her sister in law planned the bachelorette and just decided she was only going to invite the friends she knew.. so Lisa’s usual group of 8- 10 friends including me got narrowed down into 4 and Lisa decided not to correct her sister in law and just went with it, not realizing how many people she would be upsetting with not inviting people

apparently once people started attacking her she basically Lisa buried her head in sand and started making up lies to everyone on why they weren’t invited and using the same excuse of “ don’t make this a big deal “ until everyone realized the reasons were bullshit and called her out for it and the real truth came out

Sarah has informed me the girls who weren’t invited have all pulled out of the wedding, their partners included because they got the same annoyed response from Lisa before she told the truth and they all thought they didn’t deserve that… then she finally asked me what Lisa told me and I went deathly quiet on the phone before finally admitting she used my pregnancy as a excuse which then started poor Sarah on another rant of anger on how Lisa could say that to me! When I’m pregnant.. anyway we ended the call and she hoped we could get coffee sometime so I think I’ve made a friend?

so.. that’s the update.. this pregnant lady is very confused.. and I’m currently the number one buyer of ice cream at my local dairy LOL

**thelastyellowskittle**

*Don’t go. Whatever is going on behind the scenes will ensure this isn’t a celebratory event with friends and laughter. Finish whatever tasks you’re working on/promised for the wedding and bow out. It’s already extremely toxic and my guess would be that you haven’t even seen all the drama yet. Focus on your new bundle to be and use the day of the wedding as some time for you and your husband to baby moon… or pre-baby moon!*

&#x200B;

**UncleRumpy12**

*And when she drops out of the wedding, OP should use her pregnancy as the reason*

&#x200B;

**tiredofusernames11**

*So my biggest issue with all this is Lisa lying to you and her other friends. I suspect if she had been honest with you this wouldn’t have been a big thing. “Hey, my future SIL planned this and excluded people she didn’t know. I felt uncomfortable pushing back. I regret it because I know it hurt the feelings of people I care about.” How hard is that to say?*

&#x200B;

**LogicalDifference529**

*I can’t figure out why the hell she posted it online?*

>OOP: I think that’s the part that I’m struggling with as well  
>  
>It’s the fact she posted it online it’s the fact that the caption was “Couldn’t have asked for a better day, blessed with the best of friends “  
>  
>And maybe I’ll admit that’s an odd thing to get upset about but it just felt a bit like someone cut me open and then rubbed salt and lemon juice into the wound.. it’s one thing not being invited.. it’s another seeing a caption like that and having the internal thought of “ I’ll just go fuck myself then “

&#x200B;

**Significant\_Planter**

*Okay so I was actually feeling bad for her thinking that maybe she has a sister-in-law that is domineering and one of those people that everyone just goes along with because they will throw a literal fit if you don't.... And then I read the caption! Nah, she did that shit on purpose!*

*Just cut her out of your life. You just read how she feels about you*

**New Update**

&#x200B;

**FINAL UPDATE: WIBTAH If I didn’t attend my friends wedding after I wasn’t invited to the bachelorette - 1 month later**

&#x200B;

Just wanna give a big thanks to everyone on Reddit for coming along on this wild journey with me, you have all helped me not go insane this past month.

onto the update- so I attended the wedding i know I know you can all boo me in the comments but I was leaning towards not going until I spoke to my mum who ultimately told me this would be a nice way of closing our chapter of friendship, I could walk away with my head held high.. later she told me that also Lisa’s mum begged my mum to convince to me attend.

I attended with my husband and I immediately noticed the vibe and aura was completely off.

People of Reddit who are married who will understand me, weddings feel like love, this didn’t.. this was technically a instagram picture perfect wedding but it could have been anyone’s wedding.. it didn’t feel personal.

My friend barely smiled unless it was photos, her vows were robotic, and the MOH was useless, that was my biggest pet peeve, it is not that hard to see the brides dress needs fluffing or she needs a drink and even I’ll admit I felt no joy watching speeches and how everyone, spoke about the groom and threw something in for the bride at the last second.

The bride acted like we were good, like there was no beef, like the bachelorette thing never happened. I felt strange, I didn’t like it because I know her and she isn’t able to hide her emotions and she wears her emotions on her sleeves so I think she genuinely thinks nothing is wrong between us. She pulled me aside and said how she loved and appreciated me and how she was excited to be an honorary aunty and kept touching my belly and blowing kisses at it. I left the wedding feel a lot of emotions, I know I’m hormonal right now and I feel everything but I just. I don’t know?

But I can sit here and admit the friendship is done, I don’t think I can look at her the same after everything I learnt talking to my mother and with how I was treated. The chapter is closed and other then the bridemaids thing I can look back somewhat fondly on our childhood and time together… planning our marriages out with our bratz dolls. I’ve never been good with friendship break ups but this time I think I am, I think I’ll be okay.

Thank you all for listening to the rambles of this pregnant lady, who has also all enjoyed your ice cream recommendations. You have all expanded my horizons.. and I’m sure the little one in my stomach appreciates it too

Signing off

Love OP

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

I got this ad for this novel and it sounds pretty good but the link for the app didn’t work I guess the app is not available in my country or was taken down again. I can’t find it anywhere especially because the title is so basic. It’s about a assistant called Katrina Morgan and her boss (CEO) Kylan Ross it’s called:

Contract Marriage with My CEO Boss
Chapter 1

Katrina Morgan woke to the familiar sounds of sirens and the distant pull of loud city life filling the crowded street below. Rolling over onto her back, she sighed and rubbed the sleep away from her eyes. She felt around in her duvet for her phone, finally finding it after a minute of lazy searching. She checked the time, relieved to see she had actually woken up before her alarm, for once.

She went over the schedule for the day in her head, calculating how much time she had to get ready before her boss’s driver would be pulling up to her building to collect her. Three years into working for Ross Corporations, she still wasn’t used to being picked up for work that way. It was essential, though. With the amount of work her boss had her handle on a daily basis, both of them needed to be driven around. It wasn’t practical for her to have her own car, not in a city like this one.

She stood from her bed, taking a moment to stretch before she stumbled to the blackout curtains covering the massive window on the far wall of her room. She pulled them back, taking in the view from your thirteenth-floor apartment. Regardless of the workload her boss gave her, or how completely impossible he was to work for most of the time, Katrina was always thankful for a view like this one.

With a small smile on her face, she hurried to take a quick shower. As soon as she was done, she wrapped a towel around her body and walked to her closet to choose an outfit. She decided on a black pantsuit, with a white button down, and a pair of red heels. She coupled the outfit with a pair of sheer nylon socks.

As soon as she was dressed, Katrina headed back to her bathroom and applied an appropriate amount of makeup. She curled her hair into loose waves, and then she brushed her teeth. With one more glance at her reflection, she left her bathroom and grabbed her briefcase from atop her dresser.

She finally turned her phone off to silent mode, and it instantly rang. Just like it did every single morning, for the last three years.

“Good morning, Sir,” Katrina said with as much cheerfulness as she could muster on a Wednesday morning.

“I need a new phone,” came the brisk reply from her boss.

She wasn’t at all surprised that he didn’t return her polite sentiment. She sighed, willing herself to remain patient.

“I just bought you a new phone last week, Sir,” she reminded him through mildly clenched teeth.

“What the f*ck does that have to do with anything? I need a new one,” her boss quipped at her impatiently.

She swallowed and pinched the bridge of her nose. He was in one of his moods, it seemed. He was always curt, and always impatient, but every so often, he’d really lay it on thick. On those days, she had no choice but to hold on for dear life and ride the mood swings with as much grace as she could muster.

“There’s a lull in meetings today between twelve and three, I’ll go and get your phone then,” she told the boss while she closed and locked her front door. “Oscar is here. I’ll be at the office shortly with-“

“With my tea, I trust. Make sure they don’t steep it for longer than three minutes this time, Katrina,” her boss interrupted, his voice icy and thin.

Oh, he was really in a mood today. She could handle it just fine. Katrina was more than used to it by now. But she felt bad for any unsuspecting intern that would have the misfortune of crossing paths with her boss today.

It was no secret that the turnover rate at Ross Corporation was remarkably high as of late, especially. Not for the least of the reasons being the boss and his… Well, his complete inability to have a single nice conversation with anyone.

Kylan Ross was, by all accounts, an asshole. A bastard, really. He had gone through fifteen assistants, since the inception of his company seven years ago. Remarkably, she had stuck around, despite his open hostility to almost every single person.

She did everything for him. From his dry cleaning, to balancing his books, to making his appointments and scheduling his doctor’s visits… She was, quite literally, Kylan’s lifeline for most things. It was overwhelming at times, to say the least. But where Kylan intimidated most people, he didn’t bother her as much. Where others got offended when Kylan was practically a robot, with only two emotions in his arsenal: Angry, and angrier; she never took it personally. And Katrina never asked why he was the way he was, either. Though she was half convinced he came out of the womb being eternally grumpy.

Katrina took people for face value, and Kylan was no different. So, while she often had to bite her tongue at the ridiculous requests her boss would throw at her daily, she also knew how to talk to him. She knew how he worked, and she knew where to avoid pushing him, in order to avoid an all-out nuclear level event from happening. Most of the time, anyway. When he was in a more unpredictable mood than most other days, it was a little bit trickier to gauge his next move.

“I’ll make sure. Anything else, Sir?” Katrina asked Kylan, while she opened the front door of her apartment building. She quickly found Oscar, right where he always was. The sleek, black SUV he drove around, was impossible to miss. It stuck out like a sore thumb among the sea of yellow taxis that littered the streets of the city.

“Is the stock meeting with Ryan today, or tomorrow?” Kylan asked with an annoyed sigh.

Katrina climbed into the back seat of the car with a silent thank you to Oscar, and then she moved her phone away from her ear, promptly putting it on speaker. She opened her calendar, so she could look at the schedule.

“It’s today at four o’clock,” she told Kylan, buckling her seat belt, while Oscar did the same in the front seat. He pulled out into traffic and headed in the direction of the coffee shop she went to every morning. It was the one place left on Kylan’s list of shops that didn’t brew his tea “all wrong”. She wasn’t sure what she would do if, and really inevitably when, he deemed this shop unworthy, too.

“Fuck. I’m sick and tired of these weekly meetings,” she heard Kylan grumble through the speaker of her phone.

Since he couldn’t see her doing so, Katrina allowed herself the satisfaction of rolling her eyes at his words. “Sir, you know the stocks have been dropping rapidly over the last few months. We need to come up with a course of action to rectify the situation. The press are-“

“The press? Don’t make me laugh, Katrina. You know I don’t give a shit what the press thinks of me,” Kylan snapped at her.

Katrina bit back a sigh. “I understand that. But while you don’t care what they think of you, that doesn’t mean that the average person echoes your opinion on journalism,” she reminded her boss gently.

Kylan released a string of impressive swear words, and she listened silently. This is how conversations like this always went with him lately, ever since the stocks for Ross Corp. had begun their steady decline. As soon as he was done filling her ear with his favorite vulgarities, he hung up without another word.

She locked her phone and put it in the side pocket of her briefcase. She closed her eyes, rubbing the sides of her forehead, willing herself to find a shred of patience to make it through the day ahead of her.

“You should get an extra shot of espresso in your coffee,” Oscar suggested with a friendly glance at her in the rearview mirror of the car.

Katrina laughed without any humor. “I don’t think that’ll be enough today, Oscar,” she admitted with a shake of her head.

Oscar nodded sympathetically, and a few minutes later, he pulled over to a curb near the coffee shop. She got out of the car and walked inside. She ordered her usual, foregoing the extra espresso shot, and then she asked for Kylan’s order.

Katrina watched meticulously as the barista crafted Kylan’s black tea, counting how long she steeped it. She didn’t know how Kylan knew if his tea had been steeped for too long or not, but he always knew. And she was always the one who got the brunt of his annoyance, were it made incorrectly. She wasn’t in the mood to deal with the fallout today, so she continued to watch the barista carefully. Katrina ensured they didn’t add even an ounce of sugar or milk, and then she paid for the drinks and headed back to Oscar.

“How can you make it through a day without coffee, Oscar?” she asked her boss’s driver, not for the first time. Oscar was nearing his fifties, but he was in immaculate shape and still retained most of his hair.

Oscar chuckled from the front seat. “Gummy worms,” he answered her with a coy smile.

She raised her eyebrows in surprise. “That’s actually fantastic,” she laughed, taking a long sip from her coffee. Her chest filled with warmth, and she immediately felt slightly more human.

Chapter 2

Five minutes later, the car was pulling into the massive parking garage beneath the behemoth all-glass building, that was Ross Corp’s headquarters. Oscar parked next to several other standard issued black SUVs and then cut the engine.

She walked inside with him, before he finally had to turn down to the security office, and she to the elevator that would take her upstairs to the top floor of the building.

“Thank you, Oscar,” she said with a wave.

Oscar smiled at her. “Don’t let him push you around too much today, Katrina,” he reminded her.

She sighed and nodded her head. “Absolutely not.”

She smiled at him one more time, before she walked to the elevator, giving a polite greeting to today’s receptionist along the way. She wasn’t at all surprised that it was someone she didn’t recognize, yet again. The employee turnover rate was impacting every department, after all.

A few minutes later, Katrina was walking out into the familiar top floor that housed the various higher-ups of Ross Corp. She walked by Ryan’s office, realizing he was on the phone. She gave him a nod and then continued on her way. This floor of the building was always relatively quiet. Kylan demanded it is that way.

The only sound she heard, was the clicking of her heels on the polished laminated flooring beneath her feet. It unsettled her at times, how lifeless this area of the company seemed to be, but she was mostly used to it by now.

She reached her office at the end of the hall, taking a moment to set down her coffee on her desk, followed by her briefcase next to it. She knew she had a million emails waiting for her eyes to go over, but she also knew that Kylan’s tea would be getting cold, and she couldn’t allow that to happen.

She left her office, his tea in hand, and continued next door. She didn’t bother knocking, she never did anymore. Kylan knew it would be her at this time of day. She pushed open the heavy, oak door, and stepped inside.

Kylan was pacing in front of the window, phone pressed to his ear, and one hand in the pocket of his perfectly tailored navy blue suit. She moved to sit in the chair in front of her desk, setting her tea down in front of her computer. She sat back in her seat, crossing her legs while her eyes trailed Kylan’s walking.

He was always pacing. Even more so, when he was in a mood like he seemed to be today.

“It’s not my fault the fucking paparazzi don’t understand boundaries. I will not be paying to replace their shitty camera,” Kylan quipped into his phone.

Katrina knew exactly the incident he was referring to. He had broken another camera upon leaving a business dinner a few nights ago. She had been there, and she was likely the only reason he got into the waiting car without causing a further commotion. She apologized profusely for Kylan’s thoughtlessness, citing the fact that he absolutely detested having his picture taken in such fashion, but it seemed the company the photographer worked for, wasn’t interested in pleasantries. She honestly couldn’t blame them, either.

No matter how many times she, or Ryan, tried to explain to Kylan that things like the press and paparazzi were going to be a part of everyday life when he was an incredibly young CEO of a multi-billion-dollar company, it never seemed to get through to him. He chose instead to be personally offended by the lack of privacy, and she was left to pick up the broken pieces of Kylan’s public image each time he acted out.

There was a knock on Kylan’s office door, and the face of her most trusted friend poked around the small opening they had created. Katrina cringed, noticing that Kylan flashed her a dangerous look before he turned back to pacing and looking outside.

She took the hint, standing swiftly from her seat and ushering the person outside and back into the hallway. She closed the door behind her quietly, and then she turned to look at her friend.

“He’s in a mood today, Aaron. Is that the new prototype?” she asked, referring to the small machine in Aaron’s hands.

Aaron rolled his eyes. “He’s always in a f*cking mood. I don’t know how you put up with his shit. Lucy and I think-“

She cut him off with a hand pressed to his mouth. Katrina had to stretch to reach his face since he was so much taller than herself, but she managed just fine.

“Aaron, shut up,” she warned him sweetly. “I’m not interested in what you or your girlfriend think of my job, you know that,” she reminded Aaron, for the umpteenth time.

Aaron huffed, his warm breath covering the palm of her hand. He stuck his tongue out, licking her. She squealed and removed her hand.

“You are disgusting,” she groaned as she shook her hand out.

“Better wash your hands before you go back in there. It’s like he has a damn detector for all things germs.”

Aaron shivered, his brown hair falling into his eyes momentarily.

“You’re not wrong,” she relented begrudgingly. “But is that the new prototype?” she pressed.

Aaron nodded. “It is indeed. I call it the “Nightfall 2.0”,” he told her proudly.

“You were meant to have it completed last week,” Katrina reminded Aaron.

He smiled at her sheepishly. “It was a little more difficult to program than either me or Harry anticipated,” he admitted nervously.

You nodded your head in understanding, though you really had no idea how something like programming worked. “All right, I’ll back you up if Kylan loses his shit,” she promised.

Speak of the devil, or in this case just their boss, his office door swung open at that moment. He eyed her for a second before he turned his narrowed gaze to Aaron.

“Marquez, you were meant to have that prototype to me last week,” Kylan said lowly.

Katrina noticed Aaron’s ears turn red at the tips. “I know, Sir. Harry and I are sorry. It was difficult to get the programming down just right. But we finally did it. I have no doubt the mayor will implement this one into the police force, with no issue,” Aaron told Kylan, doing his best to sound confident.

She watched her boss while the cogs turned in his mind. His stark grey eyes were unreadable, as they usually were. His sharp features looked neither too angry nor kind at that moment. The black hair of his bangs threatened to fall into his eyes, and his normally plump lips were pulled in a thin line.

“Very well. Run one more round of diagnostics, and send me the completed reports by this evening,"" he said curtly.

Aaron’s shoulders fell a few inches with obvious relief. “Absolutely,” breathed. He looked at Katrina for a moment. “Drinks tonight?” he asked.

She smiled at him. “We have a late dinner meeting tonight. But Friday, I’m all yours,” she promised.

He rolled his eyes but didn’t dare make any sort of biting remark right in front of Kylan. “See you later, then,” he said, turning around and heading back toward the elevator.

“If you’re done socializing,” Kylan deadpanned, gesturing for her to enter his office.

Katrina bit back a retort, instead walking inside and over to her usual chair in front of his desk. Kylan moved to sit in his oversized, black leather office chair behind his desk. She internally remarked, not for the first time, as to how small he looked sitting in such a chair. But even though he looks short in that humongous office chair, his domineering presence demanded undeniable respect. She was used to the energy he always carried with him, but it still surprised her at times.

“Schedule?” Kylan asked her flatly. He lifted his tea to his lips and took a small drink of it. “Not bad,” he remarked.

Katrina sighed with relief. She wouldn’t have to find a new coffee shop yet, and she was more than glad.

She cleared her throat and picked up the tablet she usually kept on Kylan’s desk. “You have a meeting in half an hour with Kyla&John Techno Corp. They still want you to choose to use their technology, for the new release of the doorbell camera.” She skimmed down the schedule a little further. “We have a free lunch, and then you have a conference call with Jordan Hughes, at two o’clock. He’s the CEO of Elorde Enterprises. He’s the one who keeps trying to get you to play golf with him. He also wants you to use his design on the blackout drones for the military,” Katrina finished before looking up for his reaction.

Kylan scoffed. “Why the f*ck would I play golf? That’s the definition of rich men standing around, parading their d*ck’s in their hands, and bragging about their accomplishments.” He scowled at nothing in particular before taking another drag from his tea.

Katrina nodded her head in agreement. Kylan was many things, but he never openly gloated about his money. She had no idea of his background before Ross Corporation, apart from the scarce information on his company bio. However, she had the distinct impression that Kylan most likely didn’t come from a wealthy background. The very air about him didn’t scream “old money” by any means, anyway.

“I need you to contact Isabel. I’ll probably need a lawyer to deal with this latest paparazzi shit,” Kylan informed her.

She watched as he pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation, and she took in the dark circles beneath his eyes.

“Have you not been taking your sleeping medication?” Katrina asked him while she jotted down a reminder to call Kylan’s lawyer. She knew the attorney wouldn’t like hearing from her again so soon, but Kylan’s temper had been something else lately.

Kylan glared at her. “It doesn’t do a damn thing to help my insomnia,” he said sternly.

Katrina sighed. “Have you taken it for more than a night or two?” she asked with a quirk of her brow.

Kylan’s glare intensified, and she had her answer.

“It won’t work unless you’re consistent with it, Sir,” she reminded him.

He clicked his tongue in annoyance. “Get off my f*cking back,” he groaned.

Katrina shrugged her shoulders. “Suit yourself,” she glanced down at the schedule in her hands again. “Other than that, we have the stock meeting with Ryan, and then dinner with Charlie. Do you need me for that one?” she asked Kylan curiously.

Kylan sighed and nodded. “The old shit likes you, and it makes it easier to deal with him where I’m not the entire focus of the conversation,” he explained.

He reached into his pocket and pushed his phone her way. She glanced down at it, taking in the severely cracked screen.

“What happened this time?” she asked him, doing her best not to sound too annoyed. Kylan went through a lot of phones, especially lately.

“F*cking Litter,” Kylan responded curtly.

Katrina didn’t fight the roll of her eyes this time. “I thought Ryan and I told you to stop going on there. You need to not engage with the trolls, Sir,” she chastised him.

Kylan glared at her. “F*ck off. They’re insufferable,” he mumbled bitterly.

She laughed slightly. “They’re almost always children, Sir,” she reminded him. “They’re just bored, and you’re famous, by all means. Oftentimes, people forget you’re just a person behind the public image you put out to the world. In your case, it’s not as likely to be much diffHarryt behind closed doors, but they don’t know that for sure,” she explained with a shrug.

“If someone wants to point out my height, or some useless shit like that, I don’t care. But the second someone starts saying I have ulterior motives for my drones, I can’t stand it,” Kylan told her, his eyes downcast and his tone dark.

Katrina nodded sympathetically. “I get it. But reacting the way you do, is exactly what they want,” she told him honestly.

Kylan rolled his eyes. “F*ck off until I need you, Katrina,” he said with a flick of his hand toward the door.

She not so quickly stood from her chair and took her leave without another word.

Kylan didn’t like to talk much about his personal feelings, and she never pushed him to. It was one of the many reasons she had lasted as long as she had at Ross Corp., she was sure of it.

Chapter 3

The day’s meetings and errands continued on in a rush, and by the time their meeting with Ryan rolled around, Katrina was exhausted. She was on her third cup of coffee, and her feet were aching in the confines of her heels.

Still, she managed to get to the meeting with Ryan a little bit early. She took a seat in front of his desk and sighed, finally taking some pressure off her screaming feet.

“Long day?” Ryan mused from behind his desk.

Katrina smiled at him. “I had to get him another phone,” she told the CFO, gesturing to the small bag she had with her.

Ryan chuckled lightly. “I’m not surprised. I saw his ranting and raving on Litter last night, and I figured it would end the way it always does.” He shook his head with another laugh.

“I told him to stop going in there again. I don’t know why he doesn’t just listen,” she said with a tired sigh.

“Maybe because he doesn’t care to listen,” Kylan deadpanned from the doorway of Ryan’s office.

Katrina flashed him a stern look. “Why to bother hiring a PR specialist as your assistant, if you’re not even going to listen to her opinions about how you handle the public?” she asked Kylan carefully.

Kylan sat in the seat next to hers. He looked every bit bored, and she was once again confused as to how a man like himself, and a man like Ryan, had ever come together to create Ross Corp, all those years ago.

“I told you before, and I’ll tell you again. I’ll not have my life called into question the way those internet shits do,” Kylan said sternly. He reached for the bag containing his new phone, and she handed it to him wordlessly.

Ryan sighed loudly from behind his desk. “This is precisely why the stocks are falling, Kylan. Your behavior has never been favorable, but it’s getting increasingly more sporadic. The public’s perception of you translates directly to sales and securing potential deals with fellow companies,” he explained, his eyebrows furrowing. “Stocks have fallen nearly double what they have in the last few years. And they did so over just the last few months alone,” Ryan concluded meekly.

She looked at Kylan with a frown. “He’s right. Your attitude with both the press and people online, have both been lacking any kind of humanity. It goes against what Ross Corporation stands for, at its basic function. Which is to aid in the investigations of the police, and the security of someone’s home,” she reminded her boss.

Kylan scoffed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “What would you have me do?” He asked both Katrina and Ryan impatiently.

Katrina looked at Ryan expectantly. She had no idea what to do, truthfully. Talking to Kylan and reminding him why it was never a good idea to get in a fight with a teenager on the internet or to grab and toss a photographer’s camera, never worked. Katrina honestly wasn’t sure what would get through to him, if anything could at all.

“We’re losing employees rapidly. Their work environment has no life to it anymore,” she added for good measure. It was true, there was no company spirit, or pride anymore. What once was a vibrant, blossoming company in its infancy, was now a lackluster and slowly dying spark.

Something needed to change. And quickly.

“I have a proposal,” Ryan began cautiously. Katrina and Kylan both looked at him curiously, and he cleared his throat. “I think… Well, Kylan, I think you need to begin a relationship with someone. It needs to be someone with the right personality. Someone with whom you can openly show to the world, and who can handle the inevitable limelight that will follow. You need someone charismatic, who can shine when you yourself choose to complain,” he droned on.

She couldn’t say she was entirely surprised by Ryan’s proposal. Kylan was, after all, a thirty-two-year-old bachelor. She could understand the public appeal that could come from a seemingly unobtainable, hardened individual, dating a less high maintenance person.

If it were at all possible to appeal to Kylan’s humanity to the public, he had to do it. He had to try. Or Ross Corp would be run into the ground.

“I think it’s a fantastic idea,” she agreed earnestly. “If you can appear even a little more… Approachable, or relatable on a personal level, we need to showcase that,” she added for good measure. “And that is having a girlfriend.”

“A wife,” Ryan suddenly said.

Katrina turned to Ryan while Kylan had his eyebrows furrowed so much that his face looked scrunched and constipated.

“I mean, someone you can agree with for a fake marriage. A contract.”

Katrina’s face lit up before looking at her boss. “That’s right! Having a fiance, someone you will “marry” is more convincing than having a girlfriend.”

Kylan was looking at both Katrina and Ryan like they had each grown a second head, and she knew she was fighting a losing battle already.

“How many fights did you get into on Litter yesterday?” she decided to ask Kylan.

Her boss shot her a menacing glare, but she didn’t even flinch. Katrina was so used to his tactics, and Ryan wasn’t wrong with this idea.

“How many phones have you gone through in this last week alone?” she pressed on.

Kylan sighed and rubbed his forehead, very clearly annoyed. He ran his fingers through his hair, pushing his bangs back in the process. “I only get into fights on Litter that are worthy of my time,” he grumbled.

Katrina very nearly laughed. “Fighting with, what is it, twelve year old’s, is worthy of your time?” she mused, her eyebrows raised in amusement.

“F*ck off. The one yesterday was a damn tyrant,” Kylan insisted with yet another glare aimed her way.

She shook her head. “Sir, did you not hire me because I graduated college with a double major in public relations and business management?” she asked her boss.

Katrina was already exhausted from trying to sway his feelings, but this wasn’t a situation where she could relent, and she knew that. Something had to give, and this was a logical idea.

“I can fire you just as quickly, Katrina,” Kylan reminded her, but his voice lacked any bite. She knew as well as he did, that Kylan would drown without Katrina Morgan. He had gone through enough assistants before her, for him to realize as much.

“Think about it, Sir. You’re thirty-two. You’ve never openly dated anyone. If you pick the right partner, you could appear vastly more relatable and human. Go to a few galas, take some pictures, and post some of those on social media. It makes sense. You’re plenty desirable around the city, among both women and men alike,” she continued to try and sway Kylan.

She knew probably better than anyone, that Kylan didn’t date. She wasn’t entirely certain he even knew how to date. It was impossible for her to picture someone like Ross Corp’s CEO being… Open enough to date anyone. She couldn’t even wrap her mind around the concept.

Sure, she knew he had the occasional one-night stand. She had run into one or two of the women as they left his penthouse when Katrina dropped off his dry cleaning, but that was as far as any sort of relationship going.

Ryan had been sitting silently for the duration of her speech, watching both her and Kylan closely. She wasn’t sure if he would have any more luck than herself, but she looked at him for help. Graciously, he took the hint.

“Kylan, you and I have worked incredibly hard to build Ross Corp from the ground up. We’re in twenty-seven countries, and in almost five-million homes around the world. Several police forces have opted to use our drones. It pains me greatly to see our stocks plummeting and to see you receiving the brunt of the backlash on social media. Would you please at least consider this idea?” he implored Kylan.

Kylan sighed, shoving his hands in the pockets of his immaculately pressed suit, and then he began to pace. Katrina and Ryan, both let him walk for a while. Katrina had said all she could, and now she had to let Kylan process the information. It was how he worked, each time a big decision was involved. This was no different, and perhaps it was an even larger choice than what was normal.

“F*cking fine. I don’t see how this could possibly help the company, but I’m not the PR expert, I suppose,” Kylan looked at her with narrowed eyes, and she flashed him a small smile. “Give me a week to find someone,” he told her and Ryan, looking at both of them in turn.

“Do you need help downloading some dating apps, or something similar? I just need to know your preferences. Woman, man-“ She was effectively cut off.

“Woman, Katrina. And no. I’ll try and find someone the good old-fashioned way, by going to a f*cking bar,” Kylan pinched the bridge of his nose.

She nodded her head. “Sounds good, Sir. If there’s nothing else, I’m going to freshen up before we go to dinner with Charlie.” She stood from her chair and waited to be dismissed.

“Fine.” Kylan waved her away.

Katrina gave a polite nod to her boss, and then she smiled with relief at Ryan, before she left his office.

She didn’t know if this would really work, but she and Ryan were hopeful.

She couldn’t help but feel mildly sorry for the poor woman Kylan was going to marry. He really was an impossible man to get along with.

Chapter 4

Half an hour later, she was back in an SUV with Oscar, waiting for Kylan to make his appearance. Every two weeks, she had dinner with Keith, Kylan’s uncle. He was an angel investor for Ross Corp, and the only thing he asked in return, was to have dinner with Kylan.

Keith was someone that Kylan could tolerate slightly more than others, much like Ryan and herself. Sometimes, he asked her to go to dinner too, and other times he let her go home instead. She wasn’t surprised he would want her involved today, with the extra prevalent shadow hanging over his head.

Kylan finally made his way into the back seat of the car. He sat next to her, with only the middle seat in between them. She gave him a small smile, and he nodded his head at her.

“Did you-“ he began.

She knew what he was going to ask. “Your dry cleaning was picked up and taken home,” she told him calmly.

“And what about-“ he added.

“Your suit for the gala this weekend? Pressed and tailored. It’s at your home, too,” she said with the same calm tone.

Kylan nodded at her slowly, eyeing her carefully. “Right. Good work,” he said curtly.

It was the closest her boss ever came to saying thank you, and she smiled at him again in response.

Twenty minutes later, Oscar was dropping Katrina and Kylan off at the latest upscale restaurant Keith chose. Kylan had the decency to hold the car door open for her, and she nodded at him in thanks as she climbed out.

Keith was already waiting inside when they walked in, and the two of them made their way over to him, Kylan on her heels. She sat down across from Keith, with Kylan on her right.

“Ahh, my dear Kate. You’re still working for this grumpy little shit?” Keith asked her, lifting his glass of a far too expensive Cabernet Sauvignon, and taking a long drink from it.

She laughed and nodded. “I am.”

Kylan scoffed and lifted the glass of whiskey Keith had already ordered for him. “I wanted it neat, old man,” he complained about the ice in his cup.

“I’ll take that one if you don’t want it. I’ll order you a new one,” she offered her boss.

Kylan eyed her curiously before he handed her his whiskey. Katrina drank it easily, wincing as the fiery liquid skirted down her throat.

Dinner went as it always did, with Keith poking and prodding at Kylan relentlessly, and Kylan responding with less and less patience as time wore on.

Katrina entered the conversation where she felt it was relevant, but she spent the majority of the time enjoying her steak and vegetables quietly. It was really the only true draw from these fancy dinners: the expensive food.

She noticed that Kylan was looking at her more so than he usually did. She couldn’t read his expression, as always, but it was making her increasingly more on edge as time went on. She didn’t know what was on his mind, and it was making her nervous.

Finally, she finished dinner, and Keith stood to say farewell. “I still don’t know why you’re working for this one. You could do a lot better, Kate. Does he even pay you well?” Keith asked her, putting on his jacket in the process of speaking.

“He pays me well enough. I’ll forever have a mountain of student debt, but that’s not his fault. It’s just what happens when you have to pay your own way through school.”

Katrina shrugged nonchalantly, avoiding Kylan’s gaze. She didn’t normally discuss her pay with anyone and especially not in front of her boss.

Keith laughed and shook his head. “Give your assistant a raise, you damn brat,” he chastised Kylan.

She felt her face grow warm and looked down at the table in embarrassment. “Really, Keith. I’m fine. Thank you for the dinner, as always,” she told the older gentleman politely.

Kylan glowered at Keith but made no move to say anything at all.

Keith was used to his behavior and simply ruffled his hair, before he turned and walked from the restaurant.

Kylan was looking at her again, and she met his stare this time. “Sir? Shall we go?” she suggested.

He continued to stare at her for a moment longer, and she began to grow self-conscious.

“Do I have something on my face?” she asked him, grabbing a napkin and wiping her mouth swiftly.

“Your face is fine. Let’s go,” Kylan said quietly, standing from his chair and leading the way back to Oscar.

The drive home was silent and Katrina couldn’t quite pinpoint why, but Kylan seemed to be especially tense for the entirety of the ride. When Oscar dropped her off and she offered a goodnight, Kylan didn’t even look at her.

She wasn’t entirely put off by his behavior, but it did make her a little confused.

Finally making her way inside after an especially exhausting day, she kicked off her cursed heels and drew a bubble bath for herself.

Katrina promptly stripped her clothing and soaked in the warm, inviting soapy water for a long time. By the time her skin was properly wrinkled, she had got out and dressed in her usual nightgown. She brushed her teeth and removed her makeup. She finally walked to her bed, yawning the entire way.

She was just about to plug her phone in to charge when she received a text message. By this point, it was nearing midnight, and she was confused about who would be talking to her this late.

It threw her off even more when she saw the message from Kylan. He never communicated with her this way. It was either always through email, an in-person conversation, or via a phone call.

""I have something to discuss with you at our usual meeting, first thing in the morning,"" his text says.

""Is everything all right, Sir?"" she replied.

""Go to sleep.""

She stared at her phone in confusion. Why was he acting so strangely? What did he have to talk to her about, and why was he warning her beforehand?

""Yes, Sir. Goodnight.""

He didn’t respond after that, and she was left feeling restless for a long while before her body finally allowed her to fall asleep.

~O~O~O~

The next morning, Katrina went through her normal routine of getting ready for the day, opting to wear a form-fitting red dress that stopped just above her knees. She chose a pair of black heels and paired the ensemble with a pair of black nylons.

She kept her midnight black hair down, curling it again quickly with practiced hands. She finished her makeup with a bold red lip. Katrina then grabbed her briefcase and her peacoat.

Thirty minutes later, she arrived at Ross Corp., Kylan’s tea and her coffee in hand. She was doing her best not to be nervous about what Kylan could possibly have to talk to her about, but it was nearly impossible.

She couldn’t help but wonder if she had gone too far, with how she backed up Ryan and his idea that Kylan finds someone to publicly date to marry, no matter how fake it should be. Katrina had merely spoken her mind, but Kylan wasn’t always the sort of person who appreciated that kind of forwardness, if at all.

She reached her floor, stepped out, and walked to deposit her jacket and briefcase in her office. She squared her shoulders, took a deep breath, and then finally walked next door to Kylan’s office.

She stepped inside his office, setting his tea down in his usual spot, and then took a seat in front of his desk with her coffee.

He was standing at his window, much like he always was in the morning, and he had his hands in the pockets of his black suit pants. He turned around to face her, and she was surprised to see he was only wearing a white button-down shirt. It was wrinkle-free and tucked in, as usual, but she didn’t think she had ever seen him without a suit jacket before.

The sleeves of his shirt were rolled up to his forearms, and the first two buttons of his shirt were undone. He looked… different, and she fought to avert her eyes.

Katrina knew Kylan was attractive, and she knew that everyone else noticed it too. It wasn’t a surprise, but she never paid him any mind in that regard. It was highly inappropriate, not to mention the fact that Kylan was a difficult man, all around.",1,1731333286.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Hi I am 30m searching for a bride arrange marriage set up. I met this girl who is 25f through arrange marriage set up . First we talked for few days there was like instant connection I was happy that someone is also interested. But my parents didn’t agree for the match. But we continued to talk she was like I so much like you and I was also interested so I said I will talk to my parents definitely and we will work it out. As the days passed we talked and I was struggling with my parents. Just after a few weeks I asked girl for a coffee but she refused I thought since she was from village background I was like ok. As the day passed I was asking or giving hints she was strictly denying it first we marry then we do , I am afraid because of metro, I don’t travel and all. I was like ok since my parents were so strict I was saying if my parents didn’t agree we will try other ways of marriage . She was like I can’t but  she is the girl who said I can’t live without you I like you so much I can’t imagine future without you.

After few days she was like if I try this way my sister and family reputation will be bad I can’t do it we will cancel it. Just like that I was like how this much easy. I was arguing with my parents for her she was just ready to leave. I became skeptical also like is it so easy for her to do this and all just leave . If I do marriage outside my parents will loose reputation and all right. Still she is refusing to go out with for coffee. I am thinking is it really love because she says would die also sometimes. Everything has to go as she thinks in her ways. As the day passed I am realising whenever we talk it’s always about her only not about me .",1,1731333170.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

[On this day in 2020, Keith tweeted the above. Will we see something similar?](https://preview.redd.it/2f701tvr0a0e1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8bef5210a336b9200369d03a3495bcf8cb96f82)

Things are heating up as Institutional Buyers join the fray! This was an important component to our Fall 2020 run-up and attracted a variety of 'analyst' reassessments of the stock following the Q3 2020 earnings report in December. What exactly is in store for us this time around? And can we expect institutional buyers to reveal more substantial positions in the weeks to come? Let's take a look a look at our data and see what insights we can glean! 

**Price Movement Recap**

[11\/8 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/j96h4ccbc90e1.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f32f86d2cbc875137daff2caff1c631310cb20e)

Friday was a weird day for at leas two reasons - first, in that it we got an inexplicable IV drop pre-market, second in that we got some heavy buying volume late in the day that just barely left our $25 calls for 11/8 expiry OTM. 

Wow. Let's start our discussion in the first place. Weird IV.

[11\/7-11\/8 PM and AH Trading 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/xii2u884d90e1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=58e6742f176ffd57aed77a4e48d3dba9b1ddb620)

You'll recall that I put together a post about this IV dip after publishing my 11/8 premarket analysis. I had noticed this peculiar dip, but thought nothing of it. During AH and PM trading, I often see these stepwise IV variations. By the time of market open, they usually correct and disappear, starting off the next day's session usually elevated by a few percentage points from the previous day's close - nothing to write home about.

But as you can see above, this was different. Thanks to the observation of user '-Motorin-', I noticed that IV \*didn't\* return to its closing levels on Thursday, but rather sank by full 20 percentage points! It still remains significantly reduced versus Thursday's trading during our premarket session today.

At first, I wondered whether this might have to do with a sigh of relief following the 'down the middle' Fed meeting report AH on Thursday. One would expect many stocks to behave similarly. 

They didn't. Except one which behaved similarly, but to the INVERSE of GME. Can you guess which one?

[I'll give you a hint: the company name starts with 'Dogstock.'](https://preview.redd.it/339r9z74e90e1.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb8139c4edf129a29c9b6048b7fdd377ed7c3018)

Odd. This would noticeably reduced the average extrinsic value modifier on every options contract across the chain on GME and increase it on Dogstock, sensitizing options price appreciations on the latter and desensitizing them on the former. Strange. What could this mean?

\-Motorin- offered up a sacrifice of questions to the gods of ChatGPT and revealed the following tidbit, which succinctly expresses a response to the question I just posed rhetorically above us:

ChatGPT: ""Since market makers take on the risk of buying and selling options, they adjust IV to protect against potential losses from sudden price swings. For example, if they expect high volatility due to upcoming news or unusual trading in the underlying stock, they raise IV to reflect the added risk. It’s not arbitrary; it’s based on their assessment of future risk.""

Translation: MMs expected that their risk of loss on Dogstock options was \*higher\* based on its upcoming price movement, but \*lower\* on GME.

How does that translate to what played out on Friday?

Let's recall some of my forecast for Friday's price action from me, a random regular dude with 0 industry experience, who simply read the options chain and technicals:

[Post URL: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/1gmib7w\/call\_gamma\_keeps\_piling\_up\_gme\_118\_open\_interest\/](https://preview.redd.it/hjc6a2qkf90e1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdad0c59a07c07d39521b7e2dd5e335ab3774739)

Short of it? Test of $24 early. Scenario 1) Based on typical flows and volume, we'd return to the $23-$24 with more tests into next week. 2) We get some higher volume, bullish options flows that fill in at $24 and $24.50, thereby claiming $24-$25 as a new intraday trading bracket.

I had no evidence or data to suggest that such volume would occur, so I leaned in my prediction toward the more neutral scenario, namely scenario #1. This scenario played out throughout the entirety of our AM trading session. Options flow shot us up through $24, brought us back below, some Call OI filled in at $24, but not enough at $24.50 to continue our run and we cooled off up to about 12pm. After a triple bounce on VWAP which looked poised to fall through $24 and into our lower VWAP channel, we had short, but weak reversal upward which briefly mounted the 50-min SMA... and then was picked up on volume... then sustained on higher volume... and finally propelled through $25 to a 6-month high of $25.38 on a huge MM-hedging volume spike as our $25 calls went in the money.

So... why would Market Makers assess that the possible realization of such a move warranted a \*lower-risk\* situation for them? 

May I put forth a simple bipartite proposition: 

1) Because they were net Long.

2) Because they decided premarket to establish a net long position and lowered IV premarket in order to get a discount on long calls at open. 

Why would they expect a major upward move at open? 

https://preview.redd.it/i028rsdmh90e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=9689c680fdba7d643993b6ee498bd5f4735f7898

I direct you to this institutional holdings data which I posted yesterday. Notice that on 11/7 Dimensional Fund Advisors reported that they acquired an additional 883,000 shares of GME, making them the 10th largest institutional holder of the company after Renaissance Technologies. On the same day Swiss National Bank declared they had picked up a quarter million GME shares and on 11/8 JP Morgan announced near the close of trading that they had picked up an additional quarter-million shares of GME themselves. 

Major institutions are beginning to set up net long positions in GME, as I have suggested several times would be a consequence of the company's strong fundamentals and technical consolidation at higher price levels. Perhaps MMs were responding to these reported positions. In any case, the day ended with over 16mil shares traded and a $1.50 appreciation in the underlying.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

With so many ITM Calls concentrated in our $20-$25 trading range from our past few weeks of trading close to the October floor of \~$20.50 , 11/15 Max Pain is still sitting at toward the lower end of that range. However, given some substantial profit-taking on Long Calls at $20, it has notably moved up from $20 (pre-market last Friday) to $21 (pre-market today). Let's take a look:

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 11\/8-11\/11](https://preview.redd.it/1db2zu4mk90e1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb6774bd758c88dee2998825df8d388e481075a3)

If traders and institutions are aiming to re-establish $25-$30 as our major trading macro-bracket (as opposed to $20-$25), then this pattern of Call OI deployment is heavily encouraging toward that goal. With $20 Call Delta crossing the .50 threshold, traders closed over 7,000 contracts during the early phase of our afternoon run up and on our spike through $25. 

The run up brought with it modest, but significant OI expansions at $23.50 and $24.50 (stabilizing the upward grind last Friday) and large expansions of Long Calls at $26 (nearly 7,500), $27 (over 3,000) and even some at $28 (1,200). At the same time, $30 saw an expansion primarily of Short Call OI (over 6,500), which reflects some anticipation of this strike playing the role of last week's (and of the last few months') $25 overhead resistance. 

We did have some modest Put OI expansion at $23 and $24 - 1,900 and 1,000 contracts respectively - which was sentimentally mixed (bearish at the ASK early in the day, bullish at the BID later on). 

We've also got some gambling (or prescience?) going on with WAY OTM Long Calls at $35, $40, $45 - to be expected on these types of days, I suppose - spread across all of our near-term weekly and monthly upcoming expiries. $30 Calls were hot for 12/20 and we got some interesting OI shifts for January:

[1\/17 OI Changes 11\/8-11\/11](https://preview.redd.it/b6a2ajwqn90e1.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=816ad611ac0ce887aa5017772634f75f1b48c9c0)

So the OI contraction at $20 was actually not Longs taking profits, but Shorts cutting losses (or taking profits depending on how far out they sold those contracts). The $30 OI expansion was primarily short volume (at the BID), but the $40 volume was primarily long (at the ASK). 

**Gamma Exposure**

Obviously, these substantial near-term OI shifts have some major implications for Market Maker Gamma exposure and the prospective hedging dynamics that result from it. Let's see our daily total ratio first:

https://preview.redd.it/q9kxyilio90e1.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=acd8650e46908fe4e5099d8eecbc40cb8c39d3d9

0.16 P/C GEX ratio - so 6.25 points of Call Gamma Exposure for every point of Put Gamma Exposure. Yes, that is the single highest value we've seen since the May run-up (5/10 was 10:1; 5/13 was 25:1!!!). Thus, are intraday price action is HEAVILY and primarily affected by Dealers accounting for a mix of their short and long Call positions. Since options premium value has been slanted bullish for the past few weeks, we will have to assume that (per usual) MMs are hedging mostly short call positions, meaning they will be forced to buy shares in quantity as traders move the price up at speed. Let's take a look at how this will shape up intraday:

https://preview.redd.it/8cwdvz3tq90e1.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb8cb0672631930cb3e9791d62ea43f939fc9d8

With our price at its current pre-market levels ($25.50-$26 trading range) we are shaping up to consolidate early off of our huge $25 gamma position (over 30% of all net call gamma across all options expiries is concentrated at $25). While this formed a major resistance level for months and kept a lid on our upward price action across that span of time, the fact that $26 sits just above $25 with a decent sized pair of positions at the $27 and $28 means we have downside support from gamma hedging at $25 and a substantial enough upward 'pull' to establish a trading bracket in the $25-$26 range. With $25.50 light on OI, I would expect our early trading to slip and slide up and down this local range. 

At the same time, 11/15 OPEX still hosts a solid concentration of Call Gamma at $23 and $24, meaning we have a sort 'support in depth' beneath $25 that would require an unrealistic amount of not only bearish options flow, but Long Put flow specifically to drive our price down with any sense of 'worrying' volatility.

The current setup lends itself to some consolidation at $25 and up and some opportunities for upward explorations of our wider $25-$30 macro-bracket dependent on how traders insert new Call OI at strikes up to $30. Continued buy pressure amid this MM GEX structure lends itself to such building.

**Technicals**

[7\/16-10\/29 1-Day Aggregation w\/ Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/x1lomo2js90e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f96accd4724bd5b772348ffd24ed3720cd12d7af)

Judging purely from our short term, day-to-day technicals, our recent price action has us decently overextended/overbought in terms of RSI readings (RSI >70). We are moving toward the upper limit of our now established upward channel which roughly negotiates the 50-hr SMA as a week-to-week lower bound. We have indeed abandoned the 50-day, 200-day SMA channel, though some time down the line they will likely come back into play. From these above charts, at the very least some consolidation at $25 (though perhaps some eventual correction below this week) looks technically configured.  


[11\/11\/23-11\/11\/24 1-Week Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/pukouy6wu90e1.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ea20d75fa22944ca8d20ffd1a98c9ee1ae8774d)

At the same time, however, as we try to project what our price action might look like moving forward for the next few months and where exactly this upward trend might be taking us, it is important to zoom out to the weekly chart to get a sense of what we might expect. As we do, we notice a deeper paradigm centered around the 200-week and 50-week SMA lines (as I pointed out WAY back in mid-October). With the 200SMA sitting around $28 (about the maximal extent of our near-term long call OI into November OPEX) we could see a push up to (or through) this line over the course of this week before a consolidatory correction sets in.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/wmlbu661x90e1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=26283bff5afd3e2318e2f27aeb63f2a131e65532)

You can see that IV hiccup from Friday relative to our usual IV fluctuations much more clearly on the 4-hr chart as I have it here. IV levels are still working their way back to where they were prior to Friday's trading, but they are much lower than I would have expected given the speed at which we have reclaimed these price levels over the past few weeks. This dip will also obscure our IV trends at least for another two weeks as the value will stay with our mean calculation. In any case, I could see levels stabilize over the next 2-3 weeks until we get a definitive announcement on Q3 earnings, after which point they will appreciated at a more pronounced rate.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

For today I would anticipate some play between $25 and $26 with tests of each end of the bracket. Our GEX structure suggests we continue to establish and maintain our position in the $25-$30 macrobracket for the near future. Some consolidation at $25 looks likely on our short term charts (and would be a welcome sign for steady, continued upward price action in the coming weeks), but at the same time our weekly chart points to a potential test (and overextension through) $28 before an intratrend correction sets in.

Much of how exactly this will play out will depend upon the actual price mechanics buying and selling, e.g. whether major institutions continue to reveal sizable long share positions in the company, whether there are settlement dynamics at play (for example, settlement related to Equity Index Quarterly Futures and ETFs, as suggested by user 'Far-Advantage-3868' and the much esteemed Richard Newton), and whether there are any CATalysts at work behind the scenes.

I will not speculate on any of these factors as they are outside of my informational purview. I will continue to monitor the data-sphere for potential anomalies and comment on them as they are available. In the meantime, I will continue to stay bullish, but as grounded in the data as possible and conservative in my projections in order to safeguard against potential overhype and euphoria. The worst case (if my conservative outlook is off) is MOASS, so en fin, not so bad ;)

Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!

PS: Thanks again to all those who have treated me to coffee for the next few weeks. Today's coffee (and this week's) is brought to you by the generosity of 'firm-necessary.' Cheers my friend! Support and appreciation from the community is what keeps me going.

For those of you who are on X, I have, at the encouragement of several users, decided to start crossposting there. These posts will be identical to those found here on Superstonk, so no need to leave the party here. However, just in case there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter in the Articles tab of my profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, this will in no way affect my attention here.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

1gosjn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1gosjn3/met_a_french_tourist_in_st_jamess_park_and_it/,Met a French Tourist in St James’s Park and it turned into something lovely.,"Last Thursday started with me falling asleep on the train at Crewe and ending up in London as I was up at 5 o’clock and having stayed with a friend But he had work. so to make the most of it I had breakfast at Euston. It was okay. Nothing to write home about and then I decided to go to St James’s Park. As being a Cigar smoker, it’s a great little spot to have a coffee and a Sit down and generally reflect on life. Having obtained my coffee from one of the various stands and securing a bench I cut and lit my Cigar. Which I must say went very well with the coffee. 

Around 10 minutes in a tourist passes me he smiles I smile back and nod and he proceeds walking the other direction then he turns around and approaches me again. He said he admired my clothes an unusual statement for people who would wear regular everyday clothes however I’ve been wearing vintage clothes for around 14 years now a lot of tweeds and various coloured waistcoats, pocket watch and chain etc. 

I thanked him for his kind comments he said it was very English and from that moment we hit it off, he told me he only arrived two hours before into Gatwick from Bordeaux, and that it was his first time in London. I told him about all the places he should visit and the etiquette on public transport like the underground and then we got on the subject of museums he noticed on my lapel I have a silver pharaoh head. I told him I’m an amateur Egyptologist and that I take friends around the British Museum and give them a little tour in an amateur kind of way he begged and pleaded for me to take him to the museum on Sunday. I said that would be absolutely fine.

We exchanged contact details and stayed in touch, yesterday I took him around the British museum, he thoroughly enjoyed the experience and was overwhelmed by my knowledge not to brag. Of course it being a Sunday I wanted him to experience the classic British tradition of a Sunday roast because I didn’t want him to go back to France thinking we just lived off beans on toast.

So we had a marvellous Sunday lunch at the ships Tavern in Holborn you haven’t lived until you’ve witnessed a Frenchman have his first Yorkshire pudding. He loved the food and it completely changed his opinion on British cuisine. However all he kept on about was that the British have very odd eating hours , like it very whereas in France he told me restaurants will get quite pissed off if you turn up at two in the afternoon or even 3 o’clock.

It sounds like something from a romantic novel but all it was fate brought us together and a lovely friendship has started from this. This is why I love London very much No days the same and you meet such wonderful people.",72,1731332814.0,london,8,0.93,False

1gosi1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1gosi1c/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_birthday_with_my/,AITA for not wanting to share my birthday with my grandma?,"I (18F) am turning 19 on Sunday, and my grandma (74F) is turning 75 tomorrow (Tuesday). Today, she picked me up from the bus, and as we were talking, she mentioned that she had a suggestion. I told her to go ahead, and she said she thought it might be nice for us to share my birthday on Sunday.

I feel that birthdays are really special and are one of the few times when it’s okay to have the day all about you and really celebrate, and I look forward to the celebration every year. For me, it feels even more important because last year, when I turned 18, I spent my birthday in the hospital getting my feeding tube changed (I have gastroparesis). I did get amazing gifts, but the day itself was difficult and really not what I had hoped for, so I’d been looking forward to this year as a chance to make up for it and have a proper celebration.

My grandma didn’t mean anything hurtful by her suggestion. She explained that she’s going to be busy packing for a trip on Wednesday and spending some time having tea and coffee celebrating with her sisters tomorrow, which might not leave much time to come over, have cake, and do presents. So her idea was to combine our birthdays on Sunday, and she did say I could say no if I wanted to. But honestly, I don’t feel like I can just tell her no because it feels like I’d be saying, “Sorry, I want the day to be all about me.”

It feels tricky because I don’t want to seem selfish, especially since she’ll be 75, and she’s just trying to make things easier for everyone. At the same time, though, I was hoping for one day to have just for myself, especially after last year.

I’m really torn here. Should I just agree to her suggestion and make the best of it, or is it fair to ask to keep the day for myself? And if so, how could I say that without sounding rude? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? also this is my first time properly posting so I hope it was ok- all advice is appreciated xx",2,1731332681.0,TwoHotTakes,13,1.0,False

J and I started at the company together, and honestly, I’ve been in liked him from the very beginning. He’s the kind of guy who fits in easily with office culture, the one everyone turns to for advice or to lighten the mood. He was always looking out for me when I first started, making sure I was included in things, introducing me to people, and just generally being a good friend. Somewhere along the way, I realized I was more than just friends with him. I had feelings for him and wanted to ask him out since we were both single. But I never said anything because he seemed too perfect, too out of my league.

Last Christmas, the office did Secret Santa, and J was part of the organizing team, so he knew exactly which names were left in the draw. When I walked in late, he saw me and teased, ““Oh hey, there’s only one name left, and I’m pretty sure it’s mine”. I didn’t think much of it at the time and pulled out the very last name from the box and it was J’s. My brain went blank and I panicked then blurted out “Oh no, ew.” I know, it was an awful thing to say, and I instantly regretted it. The others around us laughed, thinking I was just being dramatic, but only J knew I’d just insulted him by mistake.

J’s face dropped, and he gave me a tight, forced smile and muttered “Right… well, good luck with that,” and turned away. I knew i messed up becase as far as i know he doesn't get offended easily but when something does bother him he never let it go.

After that, things got weird. J started distancing himself. He didn’t invite me to coffee breaks anymore, didn’t text me, didn’t hang out after work like we used to. Then I found out he requested to transfer to a different team. I wanted to apologize but every time I tried to talk to him, he just gave me these short, polite responses and ended the conversation as fast as he could then find a reason to walk away. It felt like I was talking to a stranger. I was heartbroken.

In an attempt to make it right, I bought him this cute dinosaur desk lamp because he liked quirky office decor. It wasn’t much but I thought it might show him that I was thinking about him and that I was genuinely sorry. But when I came back after the holidays, I saw that it was still sitting unopened in his drawer. He hadn’t even looked at it.

Now, as Christmas approaches again, I can’t stop regretting that moment. Every time I see Christmas decorations or hear people talking about the holidays, I think about how I ruined everything with one stupid comment. J is still cold, distant, and completely professional with me. We barely speak unless it’s about work, and even then, it’s all business.

And to make things worse, Today i found out that a younger new hire is planning to ask J out before New Year’s. I’ve seen the way he talks to her, how he laughs with her, the way he used to laugh with me before everything went wrong. I can’t blame her, really. She’s funny, bubbly and has a way of getting J to smile again. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t kill me a little bit to hear that she’s going to ask him out, but I know I have no right to be upset.

At first, I thought it was just a harmless appreciation for his kindness and awesome latte art skills. But lately, I've been catching myself daydreaming about him, and it's starting to feel like more than just a simple admiration. Often, just the anticipation of seeing him makes me nervous and giddy, which feels ridiculous since I don't know anything about his life beyond the counter. 

  
I'm not sure why this is happening, especially since I've always considered myself a pretty rational person.

I have posted here before one initial flare up after increasing urges to wee in Feb 2023 which reoccured in Feb2024.

I noticed last week a small flare up. Then Sat morning after a few drinks fri night and a kebab i woke feeling fine, no wee in the night at all, after an hour driving needed to stop for a wee, then 20mins later needed again. I wee'd about 3 times in the 2.30 min drive having to stop on the services each time. Im glad i was on my own as i would have felt really embarrassed with my partner. I too live around this fear of 'what if when will it come back' i try to ignore and live my life normally. Anyway i got home later that day, had lunch and a can of Pepsi max which i felt made it worse. Then sat in lounge just trying to ignore needing a pee. I felt really low i thought it was on the way back. :o(

But this time instead i got up, and decided to crack on doing lots of snagging list diy jobs, i also resorted to what i feel does help me drinking a large mug of Caffeine free Organic Green Tea. I drank a mug and slowly over the evening my urge to pee disappeared. I wonder if that can of Pepsi Max just pushed me over the edge. I woke up Sunday relieved as i was starting to feel anxious it was the return of a worse flare up (no overnight pee etc). I stayed active Sunday around the house doing jobs and not sitting on the sofa.

Monday am still fine again,  even dared to have a coffee and am ok, but daren't have sex or Masturbate for fear of it agitating things :(  My wife understands but of course is frustrated too, i don't blame her as i am such a sexy beast ;o).

I am going to try pelvic floor exercises but i guess this is still my horrible nagging fear is the what if. So when people say hey lets go here (ie long drive or journey) my frikkin stupid brain thinks, 'what if i need the toilet' or i have to go more than once and have an episode. Its a right stupid annoying thing which does seem to be caused by physical and anxiety, and has clipped my wings so much at times :O(

I mean that Sat morning i had my music on was just enjoying life with money in my pocket on the way to viewing a car i wanted to buy. So it's not like i had worries. This event just seemed to be sitting for too with what seemed to be for whatever that morning a sensitive prostate or something, because many times ive been out friday nights at a friends house had lots of drink, food etc and driven home absolutely fine in the morning over 2 hr drive. Why then? The only difference i can think is normally ive smoked alot of weed that friday night also.

If only like all of us i could find that magic pill or answer that gives me confidence to say all i need to do is this and im prepared and will be ok that next long car journey or next this.

Bitcoin ATMs – they’re popping up in gas stations, malls, and grocery stores faster than you can say “Satoshi Nakamoto.” Once the territory of tech enthusiasts and forward-thinking coffee shops, Bitcoin ATMs are officially mainstream, putting cryptocurrency in the hands of everyone from college students to retirees. And what’s the secret sauce that makes Bitcoin ATMs even more accessible and functional? A little thing called QR codes. That’s where our Bitcoin QR code maker app (found at [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) steps in to add convenience and style to your crypto journey.

# What Is a Bitcoin ATM?

Think of a Bitcoin ATM as the lovechild of a regular ATM and a crypto exchange. It’s a standalone machine that lets you buy and sometimes sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using cash or debit. Instead of dealing with online exchanges or wallets that feel like they require a PhD to understand, Bitcoin ATMs simplify the process into something as intuitive as withdrawing cash.

Here’s how it typically works:

1. **Scan your wallet’s QR code**: Yes, QR codes are everywhere, and for good reason. Scanning the code ensures the machine knows exactly where to send your Bitcoin. If you’re using our Bitcoin QR code maker app, you’ll have a perfectly crafted QR code ready to scan and go.
2. **Insert cash**: Most Bitcoin ATMs accept cash, which means you can say goodbye to linking your bank account, waiting days for funds to transfer, or dealing with credit card restrictions.
3. **Confirm and receive Bitcoin**: Once the machine confirms your transaction, you’re now a Bitcoin holder. Whether you’re stocking up on digital gold or just dipping your toes in, you’re ready to roll.

# The Rise of Bitcoin ATMs: Crypto for the Masses

Let’s be real – not everyone has the time or energy to dive into crypto jargon, exchanges, and wallets. Bitcoin ATMs cut through all of that, providing a bridge between traditional cash and digital assets. What started as a niche service in urban tech hubs is now a feature in small towns and suburbs. Whether you’re a Bitcoin believer or a crypto newbie, Bitcoin ATMs make it possible to own a piece of the digital revolution in under five minutes.

And get this: According to recent trends, the number of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide has surged, proving that demand is only going up. You’re not alone in thinking, “Hey, maybe this Bitcoin thing is here to stay.”

# Why QR Codes Are Key to the Bitcoin ATM Experience

QR codes have become the universal language of quick, seamless transactions. With a simple scan, these codes can carry information like wallet addresses, payment details, and yes – Bitcoin transactions. When you’re using a Bitcoin ATM, the QR code acts as the “bridge” between your digital wallet and the ATM, guiding your Bitcoin into the right hands (or wallets, in this case).

But not all QR codes are created equal. Some QR codes are blurry, unreliable, or, worse, hard to scan, causing unnecessary frustration. Here’s where our Bitcoin QR code maker app steps up to save the day.

# How Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Makes Life Easier

Imagine walking up to a Bitcoin ATM, pulling out your phone, and confidently scanning a QR code that just works – no fuss, no fumbling, no frustration. That’s what we’re all about. Our app, found at [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), allows you to create precise, scannable QR codes for any Bitcoin wallet. And it’s not just for ATMs – our app is designed for any crypto transaction where accuracy is key.

Here’s why our app is a must-have in the crypto world:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: You don’t need to be a tech wizard to use our app. The interface is intuitive and designed to get you from “I want a QR code” to “I have a QR code” in seconds.
2. **Fast and Reliable**: When you’re at a Bitcoin ATM, the last thing you want is a QR code that won’t scan. Our app generates high-quality, reliable codes that you can count on every time.
3. **Perfect for On-the-Go Users**: Whether you’re at a Bitcoin ATM or making a quick in-person transaction, having a reliable QR code handy means you’re always ready to go. You can save the code to your phone or even print it out – whatever fits your crypto lifestyle.

# Bitcoin ATMs vs. Online Exchanges: Why ATMs Are Winning Hearts

For some folks, online exchanges are perfect. They’re great for traders, those who love to monitor every market shift, or anyone with hours to spare diving into crypto. But for the average person looking to pick up a bit of Bitcoin, Bitcoin ATMs have several key advantages:

* **Instant Transactions**: While online exchanges can take hours or even days to complete a transaction, Bitcoin ATMs are as fast as paying for coffee. Walk up, scan, and get your Bitcoin – no waiting necessary.
* **Cash-Friendly**: Online exchanges require linking bank accounts or using credit cards, which can feel like a hassle. Bitcoin ATMs that accept cash make it as easy as popping in a $20 bill.
* **No Account Required**: Signing up for an exchange account can be tedious, with ID verification, passwords, and, let’s face it, an endless stream of “terms and conditions.” Bitcoin ATMs are usually far simpler and may not require personal details.

# The Future of Bitcoin ATMs and QR Code Tech

Bitcoin ATMs are growing, and so is the technology surrounding them. The future could see more Bitcoin ATMs supporting multiple cryptocurrencies, even lower fees, and more integration with mobile apps. For example, imagine Bitcoin ATMs allowing users to send funds directly to a QR code generated through an app like ours – talk about next-level convenience!

QR code technology itself is evolving, too. Advanced QR codes could soon allow users to include more detailed instructions, metadata, or multi-wallet addresses in one convenient scan. As QR code tech evolves, so does the functionality of our Bitcoin QR code maker app, making sure you’re always prepared for whatever the crypto world throws your way.

# Why You Should Try Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Before Your Next ATM Visit

If you’re planning a trip to a Bitcoin ATM, it’s a great idea to try our Bitcoin QR code maker app first. You’ll get a perfectly tailored QR code that ensures smooth, hassle-free transactions. And even beyond ATMs, having a reliable QR code at the ready is ideal for fast payments, quick peer-to-peer transactions, and managing your crypto wallet like a pro.

In a world where crypto tech can feel complicated, we’re here to make one thing a bit easier. Our app makes QR code creation as easy as ordering a coffee, making sure your Bitcoin transactions go off without a hitch. And with more Bitcoin ATMs appearing by the day, there’s never been a better time to make sure you have a quality QR code ready and waiting.

# Closing Thoughts

Bitcoin ATMs are democratizing cryptocurrency access, opening the door for everyone to join the digital revolution with minimal fuss. Paired with our trusty Bitcoin QR code maker app, Bitcoin ATMs provide a fast, accessible entry point into the world of Bitcoin and beyond. So next time you see a Bitcoin ATM, know that a smooth, QR-powered transaction is just around the corner – thanks to [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

Whether you’re a casual investor, a full-on crypto enthusiast, or just curious, Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes make a dynamic duo, setting the stage for a future where cryptocurrency is as familiar as tapping your card. Happy scanning!",1,1731331571.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

It’s like unraveling a ball of emotions and trying to organize them into three minutes of something that says, “Here’s what I’m feeling, do you feel it too?”

Ever sat down with your guitar, notebook or piano, stared intensely at it, and suddenly it stares back? Yeah, we’ve all been there. 😅 The good news? That’s not a sign you suck at writing – it's part of it. Half the battle in songwriting is about *showing up*. 

### Some things that always help me stay on track:

- **Let the Mess Happen**: Seriously, get messy—write the most nonsensical, out-there lines. The ""moon is crying over spilled coffee"" sort of thing. It might all sound bizarre at first, but *something* within that mess will feel right.
  
- **Don't Force the Hook**: I know, I know—it’s tempting to immediately try and land that hook that'll soar through the charts, but don't force it right from the start. Let your lyrics get weird, go places. The hook will show up once your song speaks a bit louder.
  
- **Feel Before You Think**: You might be worried about how a line will be received by others—STOP IT for a sec. 😜 Just feel it first. Let the heart lead. Sounds cheesy, but hey, some of the greatest hooks and lyrics seem weird on paper but feel *golden*.
  
Some of the best songs out there are the ones where the writers dared to lean into the awkward, the messy, and the unstructured.

Take, for instance, the crazy randomness of lines like, ""She’s a good girl, loves her mama, loves Jesus, and America too."" That’s *Tom Petty*, folks—you don’t need Shakespeare-level metaphors to resonate. **You need relatability**.

Also, wanting every song to be perfect right away is an easy way to get NOTHING done. *Don't wait for perfection*. Write for the sake of getting thoughts out first, then dial it back later.

Sometimes it helps to:

- Challenge yourself to write 5 songs that make NO sense in one sitting.
- Go back and review material you wrote as a kid (shockingly, some of my old elementary rhymes turned into something salvable 🤨).
- Collaborate with someone who thinks randomly or even listens to wildly different genres. Different perspectives *slap*.

### Lastly, don't take yourself too seriously always:

If you miss the fun in songwriting, you’ll dry up quicker than week-old coffee on the stovetop. Allow yourself to play with sounds. Add syllables, make strange noises, and use invented words if something fits the feel. Music is both structured AND freeing. A paradox we’re lucky to engage in.

At the end of the day, all that matters is *getting something down*. Keep questioning why certain songs hit harder emotionally than others—they’ve mastered the balance between emotional authenticity and technical prowess, yes, but it all started with a crappy draft somewhere.

TL;DR – Let loose. Feel the words. Laugh at yourself. Then go polish it. Songs aren’t supposed to be locked behind rules—they’re more like emotional puzzles spilled onto paper.

I can’t find it anywhere especially because the title is so basic. It’s about a assistant called Katrina Morgan and her boss (CEO) Kylan Ross it’s called:

Contract Marriage with My CEO Boss
Chapter 1

Katrina Morgan woke to the familiar sounds of sirens and the distant pull of loud city life filling the crowded street below. Rolling over onto her back, she sighed and rubbed the sleep away from her eyes. She felt around in her duvet for her phone, finally finding it after a minute of lazy searching. She checked the time, relieved to see she had actually woken up before her alarm, for once.

She went over the schedule for the day in her head, calculating how much time she had to get ready before her boss’s driver would be pulling up to her building to collect her. Three years into working for Ross Corporations, she still wasn’t used to being picked up for work that way. It was essential, though. With the amount of work her boss had her handle on a daily basis, both of them needed to be driven around. It wasn’t practical for her to have her own car, not in a city like this one.

She stood from her bed, taking a moment to stretch before she stumbled to the blackout curtains covering the massive window on the far wall of her room. She pulled them back, taking in the view from your thirteenth-floor apartment. Regardless of the workload her boss gave her, or how completely impossible he was to work for most of the time, Katrina was always thankful for a view like this one.

With a small smile on her face, she hurried to take a quick shower. As soon as she was done, she wrapped a towel around her body and walked to her closet to choose an outfit. She decided on a black pantsuit, with a white button down, and a pair of red heels. She coupled the outfit with a pair of sheer nylon socks.

As soon as she was dressed, Katrina headed back to her bathroom and applied an appropriate amount of makeup. She curled her hair into loose waves, and then she brushed her teeth. With one more glance at her reflection, she left her bathroom and grabbed her briefcase from atop her dresser.

She finally turned her phone off to silent mode, and it instantly rang. Just like it did every single morning, for the last three years.

“Good morning, Sir,” Katrina said with as much cheerfulness as she could muster on a Wednesday morning.

“I need a new phone,” came the brisk reply from her boss.

She wasn’t at all surprised that he didn’t return her polite sentiment. She sighed, willing herself to remain patient.

“I just bought you a new phone last week, Sir,” she reminded him through mildly clenched teeth.

“What the f*ck does that have to do with anything? I need a new one,” her boss quipped at her impatiently.

She swallowed and pinched the bridge of her nose. He was in one of his moods, it seemed. He was always curt, and always impatient, but every so often, he’d really lay it on thick. On those days, she had no choice but to hold on for dear life and ride the mood swings with as much grace as she could muster.

“There’s a lull in meetings today between twelve and three, I’ll go and get your phone then,” she told the boss while she closed and locked her front door. “Oscar is here. I’ll be at the office shortly with-“

“With my tea, I trust. Make sure they don’t steep it for longer than three minutes this time, Katrina,” her boss interrupted, his voice icy and thin.

Oh, he was really in a mood today. She could handle it just fine. Katrina was more than used to it by now. But she felt bad for any unsuspecting intern that would have the misfortune of crossing paths with her boss today.

It was no secret that the turnover rate at Ross Corporation was remarkably high as of late, especially. Not for the least of the reasons being the boss and his… Well, his complete inability to have a single nice conversation with anyone.

Kylan Ross was, by all accounts, an asshole. A bastard, really. He had gone through fifteen assistants, since the inception of his company seven years ago. Remarkably, she had stuck around, despite his open hostility to almost every single person.

She did everything for him. From his dry cleaning, to balancing his books, to making his appointments and scheduling his doctor’s visits… She was, quite literally, Kylan’s lifeline for most things. It was overwhelming at times, to say the least. But where Kylan intimidated most people, he didn’t bother her as much. Where others got offended when Kylan was practically a robot, with only two emotions in his arsenal: Angry, and angrier; she never took it personally. And Katrina never asked why he was the way he was, either. Though she was half convinced he came out of the womb being eternally grumpy.

Katrina took people for face value, and Kylan was no different. So, while she often had to bite her tongue at the ridiculous requests her boss would throw at her daily, she also knew how to talk to him. She knew how he worked, and she knew where to avoid pushing him, in order to avoid an all-out nuclear level event from happening. Most of the time, anyway. When he was in a more unpredictable mood than most other days, it was a little bit trickier to gauge his next move.

“I’ll make sure. Anything else, Sir?” Katrina asked Kylan, while she opened the front door of her apartment building. She quickly found Oscar, right where he always was. The sleek, black SUV he drove around, was impossible to miss. It stuck out like a sore thumb among the sea of yellow taxis that littered the streets of the city.

“Is the stock meeting with Ryan today, or tomorrow?” Kylan asked with an annoyed sigh.

Katrina climbed into the back seat of the car with a silent thank you to Oscar, and then she moved her phone away from her ear, promptly putting it on speaker. She opened her calendar, so she could look at the schedule.

“It’s today at four o’clock,” she told Kylan, buckling her seat belt, while Oscar did the same in the front seat. He pulled out into traffic and headed in the direction of the coffee shop she went to every morning. It was the one place left on Kylan’s list of shops that didn’t brew his tea “all wrong”. She wasn’t sure what she would do if, and really inevitably when, he deemed this shop unworthy, too.

“Fuck. I’m sick and tired of these weekly meetings,” she heard Kylan grumble through the speaker of her phone.

Since he couldn’t see her doing so, Katrina allowed herself the satisfaction of rolling her eyes at his words. “Sir, you know the stocks have been dropping rapidly over the last few months. We need to come up with a course of action to rectify the situation. The press are-“

“The press? Don’t make me laugh, Katrina. You know I don’t give a shit what the press thinks of me,” Kylan snapped at her.

Katrina bit back a sigh. “I understand that. But while you don’t care what they think of you, that doesn’t mean that the average person echoes your opinion on journalism,” she reminded her boss gently.

Kylan released a string of impressive swear words, and she listened silently. This is how conversations like this always went with him lately, ever since the stocks for Ross Corp. had begun their steady decline. As soon as he was done filling her ear with his favorite vulgarities, he hung up without another word.

She locked her phone and put it in the side pocket of her briefcase. She closed her eyes, rubbing the sides of her forehead, willing herself to find a shred of patience to make it through the day ahead of her.

“You should get an extra shot of espresso in your coffee,” Oscar suggested with a friendly glance at her in the rearview mirror of the car.

Katrina laughed without any humor. “I don’t think that’ll be enough today, Oscar,” she admitted with a shake of her head.

Oscar nodded sympathetically, and a few minutes later, he pulled over to a curb near the coffee shop. She got out of the car and walked inside. She ordered her usual, foregoing the extra espresso shot, and then she asked for Kylan’s order.

Katrina watched meticulously as the barista crafted Kylan’s black tea, counting how long she steeped it. She didn’t know how Kylan knew if his tea had been steeped for too long or not, but he always knew. And she was always the one who got the brunt of his annoyance, were it made incorrectly. She wasn’t in the mood to deal with the fallout today, so she continued to watch the barista carefully. Katrina ensured they didn’t add even an ounce of sugar or milk, and then she paid for the drinks and headed back to Oscar.

“How can you make it through a day without coffee, Oscar?” she asked her boss’s driver, not for the first time. Oscar was nearing his fifties, but he was in immaculate shape and still retained most of his hair.

Oscar chuckled from the front seat. “Gummy worms,” he answered her with a coy smile.

She raised her eyebrows in surprise. “That’s actually fantastic,” she laughed, taking a long sip from her coffee. Her chest filled with warmth, and she immediately felt slightly more human.

Chapter 2

Five minutes later, the car was pulling into the massive parking garage beneath the behemoth all-glass building, that was Ross Corp’s headquarters. Oscar parked next to several other standard issued black SUVs and then cut the engine.

She walked inside with him, before he finally had to turn down to the security office, and she to the elevator that would take her upstairs to the top floor of the building.

“Thank you, Oscar,” she said with a wave.

Oscar smiled at her. “Don’t let him push you around too much today, Katrina,” he reminded her.

She sighed and nodded her head. “Absolutely not.”

She smiled at him one more time, before she walked to the elevator, giving a polite greeting to today’s receptionist along the way. She wasn’t at all surprised that it was someone she didn’t recognize, yet again. The employee turnover rate was impacting every department, after all.

A few minutes later, Katrina was walking out into the familiar top floor that housed the various higher-ups of Ross Corp. She walked by Ryan’s office, realizing he was on the phone. She gave him a nod and then continued on her way. This floor of the building was always relatively quiet. Kylan demanded it is that way.

The only sound she heard, was the clicking of her heels on the polished laminated flooring beneath her feet. It unsettled her at times, how lifeless this area of the company seemed to be, but she was mostly used to it by now.

She reached her office at the end of the hall, taking a moment to set down her coffee on her desk, followed by her briefcase next to it. She knew she had a million emails waiting for her eyes to go over, but she also knew that Kylan’s tea would be getting cold, and she couldn’t allow that to happen.

She left her office, his tea in hand, and continued next door. She didn’t bother knocking, she never did anymore. Kylan knew it would be her at this time of day. She pushed open the heavy, oak door, and stepped inside.

Kylan was pacing in front of the window, phone pressed to his ear, and one hand in the pocket of his perfectly tailored navy blue suit. She moved to sit in the chair in front of her desk, setting her tea down in front of her computer. She sat back in her seat, crossing her legs while her eyes trailed Kylan’s walking.

He was always pacing. Even more so, when he was in a mood like he seemed to be today.

“It’s not my fault the fucking paparazzi don’t understand boundaries. I will not be paying to replace their shitty camera,” Kylan quipped into his phone.

Katrina knew exactly the incident he was referring to. He had broken another camera upon leaving a business dinner a few nights ago. She had been there, and she was likely the only reason he got into the waiting car without causing a further commotion. She apologized profusely for Kylan’s thoughtlessness, citing the fact that he absolutely detested having his picture taken in such fashion, but it seemed the company the photographer worked for, wasn’t interested in pleasantries. She honestly couldn’t blame them, either.

No matter how many times she, or Ryan, tried to explain to Kylan that things like the press and paparazzi were going to be a part of everyday life when he was an incredibly young CEO of a multi-billion-dollar company, it never seemed to get through to him. He chose instead to be personally offended by the lack of privacy, and she was left to pick up the broken pieces of Kylan’s public image each time he acted out.

There was a knock on Kylan’s office door, and the face of her most trusted friend poked around the small opening they had created. Katrina cringed, noticing that Kylan flashed her a dangerous look before he turned back to pacing and looking outside.

She took the hint, standing swiftly from her seat and ushering the person outside and back into the hallway. She closed the door behind her quietly, and then she turned to look at her friend.

“He’s in a mood today, Aaron. Is that the new prototype?” she asked, referring to the small machine in Aaron’s hands.

Aaron rolled his eyes. “He’s always in a f*cking mood. I don’t know how you put up with his shit. Lucy and I think-“

She cut him off with a hand pressed to his mouth. Katrina had to stretch to reach his face since he was so much taller than herself, but she managed just fine.

“Aaron, shut up,” she warned him sweetly. “I’m not interested in what you or your girlfriend think of my job, you know that,” she reminded Aaron, for the umpteenth time.

Aaron huffed, his warm breath covering the palm of her hand. He stuck his tongue out, licking her. She squealed and removed her hand.

“You are disgusting,” she groaned as she shook her hand out.

“Better wash your hands before you go back in there. It’s like he has a damn detector for all things germs.”

Aaron shivered, his brown hair falling into his eyes momentarily.

“You’re not wrong,” she relented begrudgingly. “But is that the new prototype?” she pressed.

Aaron nodded. “It is indeed. I call it the “Nightfall 2.0”,” he told her proudly.

“You were meant to have it completed last week,” Katrina reminded Aaron.

He smiled at her sheepishly. “It was a little more difficult to program than either me or Harry anticipated,” he admitted nervously.

You nodded your head in understanding, though you really had no idea how something like programming worked. “All right, I’ll back you up if Kylan loses his shit,” she promised.

Speak of the devil, or in this case just their boss, his office door swung open at that moment. He eyed her for a second before he turned his narrowed gaze to Aaron.

“Marquez, you were meant to have that prototype to me last week,” Kylan said lowly.

Katrina noticed Aaron’s ears turn red at the tips. “I know, Sir. Harry and I are sorry. It was difficult to get the programming down just right. But we finally did it. I have no doubt the mayor will implement this one into the police force, with no issue,” Aaron told Kylan, doing his best to sound confident.

She watched her boss while the cogs turned in his mind. His stark grey eyes were unreadable, as they usually were. His sharp features looked neither too angry nor kind at that moment. The black hair of his bangs threatened to fall into his eyes, and his normally plump lips were pulled in a thin line.

“Very well. Run one more round of diagnostics, and send me the completed reports by this evening,"" he said curtly.

Aaron’s shoulders fell a few inches with obvious relief. “Absolutely,” breathed. He looked at Katrina for a moment. “Drinks tonight?” he asked.

She smiled at him. “We have a late dinner meeting tonight. But Friday, I’m all yours,” she promised.

He rolled his eyes but didn’t dare make any sort of biting remark right in front of Kylan. “See you later, then,” he said, turning around and heading back toward the elevator.

“If you’re done socializing,” Kylan deadpanned, gesturing for her to enter his office.

Katrina bit back a retort, instead walking inside and over to her usual chair in front of his desk. Kylan moved to sit in his oversized, black leather office chair behind his desk. She internally remarked, not for the first time, as to how small he looked sitting in such a chair. But even though he looks short in that humongous office chair, his domineering presence demanded undeniable respect. She was used to the energy he always carried with him, but it still surprised her at times.

“Schedule?” Kylan asked her flatly. He lifted his tea to his lips and took a small drink of it. “Not bad,” he remarked.

Katrina sighed with relief. She wouldn’t have to find a new coffee shop yet, and she was more than glad.

She cleared her throat and picked up the tablet she usually kept on Kylan’s desk. “You have a meeting in half an hour with Kyla&John Techno Corp. They still want you to choose to use their technology, for the new release of the doorbell camera.” She skimmed down the schedule a little further. “We have a free lunch, and then you have a conference call with Jordan Hughes, at two o’clock. He’s the CEO of Elorde Enterprises. He’s the one who keeps trying to get you to play golf with him. He also wants you to use his design on the blackout drones for the military,” Katrina finished before looking up for his reaction.

Kylan scoffed. “Why the f*ck would I play golf? That’s the definition of rich men standing around, parading their d*ck’s in their hands, and bragging about their accomplishments.” He scowled at nothing in particular before taking another drag from his tea.

Katrina nodded her head in agreement. Kylan was many things, but he never openly gloated about his money. She had no idea of his background before Ross Corporation, apart from the scarce information on his company bio. However, she had the distinct impression that Kylan most likely didn’t come from a wealthy background. The very air about him didn’t scream “old money” by any means, anyway.

“I need you to contact Isabel. I’ll probably need a lawyer to deal with this latest paparazzi shit,” Kylan informed her.

She watched as he pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation, and she took in the dark circles beneath his eyes.

“Have you not been taking your sleeping medication?” Katrina asked him while she jotted down a reminder to call Kylan’s lawyer. She knew the attorney wouldn’t like hearing from her again so soon, but Kylan’s temper had been something else lately.

Kylan glared at her. “It doesn’t do a damn thing to help my insomnia,” he said sternly.

Katrina sighed. “Have you taken it for more than a night or two?” she asked with a quirk of her brow.

Kylan’s glare intensified, and she had her answer.

“It won’t work unless you’re consistent with it, Sir,” she reminded him.

He clicked his tongue in annoyance. “Get off my f*cking back,” he groaned.

Katrina shrugged her shoulders. “Suit yourself,” she glanced down at the schedule in her hands again. “Other than that, we have the stock meeting with Ryan, and then dinner with Charlie. Do you need me for that one?” she asked Kylan curiously.

Kylan sighed and nodded. “The old shit likes you, and it makes it easier to deal with him where I’m not the entire focus of the conversation,” he explained.

He reached into his pocket and pushed his phone her way. She glanced down at it, taking in the severely cracked screen.

“What happened this time?” she asked him, doing her best not to sound too annoyed. Kylan went through a lot of phones, especially lately.

“F*cking Litter,” Kylan responded curtly.

Katrina didn’t fight the roll of her eyes this time. “I thought Ryan and I told you to stop going on there. You need to not engage with the trolls, Sir,” she chastised him.

Kylan glared at her. “F*ck off. They’re insufferable,” he mumbled bitterly.

She laughed slightly. “They’re almost always children, Sir,” she reminded him. “They’re just bored, and you’re famous, by all means. Oftentimes, people forget you’re just a person behind the public image you put out to the world. In your case, it’s not as likely to be much diffHarryt behind closed doors, but they don’t know that for sure,” she explained with a shrug.

“If someone wants to point out my height, or some useless shit like that, I don’t care. But the second someone starts saying I have ulterior motives for my drones, I can’t stand it,” Kylan told her, his eyes downcast and his tone dark.

Katrina nodded sympathetically. “I get it. But reacting the way you do, is exactly what they want,” she told him honestly.

Kylan rolled his eyes. “F*ck off until I need you, Katrina,” he said with a flick of his hand toward the door.

She not so quickly stood from her chair and took her leave without another word.

Kylan didn’t like to talk much about his personal feelings, and she never pushed him to. It was one of the many reasons she had lasted as long as she had at Ross Corp., she was sure of it.

Chapter 3

The day’s meetings and errands continued on in a rush, and by the time their meeting with Ryan rolled around, Katrina was exhausted. She was on her third cup of coffee, and her feet were aching in the confines of her heels.

Still, she managed to get to the meeting with Ryan a little bit early. She took a seat in front of his desk and sighed, finally taking some pressure off her screaming feet.

“Long day?” Ryan mused from behind his desk.

Katrina smiled at him. “I had to get him another phone,” she told the CFO, gesturing to the small bag she had with her.

Ryan chuckled lightly. “I’m not surprised. I saw his ranting and raving on Litter last night, and I figured it would end the way it always does.” He shook his head with another laugh.

“I told him to stop going in there again. I don’t know why he doesn’t just listen,” she said with a tired sigh.

“Maybe because he doesn’t care to listen,” Kylan deadpanned from the doorway of Ryan’s office.

Katrina flashed him a stern look. “Why to bother hiring a PR specialist as your assistant, if you’re not even going to listen to her opinions about how you handle the public?” she asked Kylan carefully.

Kylan sat in the seat next to hers. He looked every bit bored, and she was once again confused as to how a man like himself, and a man like Ryan, had ever come together to create Ross Corp, all those years ago.

“I told you before, and I’ll tell you again. I’ll not have my life called into question the way those internet shits do,” Kylan said sternly. He reached for the bag containing his new phone, and she handed it to him wordlessly.

Ryan sighed loudly from behind his desk. “This is precisely why the stocks are falling, Kylan. Your behavior has never been favorable, but it’s getting increasingly more sporadic. The public’s perception of you translates directly to sales and securing potential deals with fellow companies,” he explained, his eyebrows furrowing. “Stocks have fallen nearly double what they have in the last few years. And they did so over just the last few months alone,” Ryan concluded meekly.

She looked at Kylan with a frown. “He’s right. Your attitude with both the press and people online, have both been lacking any kind of humanity. It goes against what Ross Corporation stands for, at its basic function. Which is to aid in the investigations of the police, and the security of someone’s home,” she reminded her boss.

Kylan scoffed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “What would you have me do?” He asked both Katrina and Ryan impatiently.

Katrina looked at Ryan expectantly. She had no idea what to do, truthfully. Talking to Kylan and reminding him why it was never a good idea to get in a fight with a teenager on the internet or to grab and toss a photographer’s camera, never worked. Katrina honestly wasn’t sure what would get through to him, if anything could at all.

“We’re losing employees rapidly. Their work environment has no life to it anymore,” she added for good measure. It was true, there was no company spirit, or pride anymore. What once was a vibrant, blossoming company in its infancy, was now a lackluster and slowly dying spark.

Something needed to change. And quickly.

“I have a proposal,” Ryan began cautiously. Katrina and Kylan both looked at him curiously, and he cleared his throat. “I think… Well, Kylan, I think you need to begin a relationship with someone. It needs to be someone with the right personality. Someone with whom you can openly show to the world, and who can handle the inevitable limelight that will follow. You need someone charismatic, who can shine when you yourself choose to complain,” he droned on.

She couldn’t say she was entirely surprised by Ryan’s proposal. Kylan was, after all, a thirty-two-year-old bachelor. She could understand the public appeal that could come from a seemingly unobtainable, hardened individual, dating a less high maintenance person.

If it were at all possible to appeal to Kylan’s humanity to the public, he had to do it. He had to try. Or Ross Corp would be run into the ground.

“I think it’s a fantastic idea,” she agreed earnestly. “If you can appear even a little more… Approachable, or relatable on a personal level, we need to showcase that,” she added for good measure. “And that is having a girlfriend.”

“A wife,” Ryan suddenly said.

Katrina turned to Ryan while Kylan had his eyebrows furrowed so much that his face looked scrunched and constipated.

“I mean, someone you can agree with for a fake marriage. A contract.”

Katrina’s face lit up before looking at her boss. “That’s right! Having a fiance, someone you will “marry” is more convincing than having a girlfriend.”

Kylan was looking at both Katrina and Ryan like they had each grown a second head, and she knew she was fighting a losing battle already.

“How many fights did you get into on Litter yesterday?” she decided to ask Kylan.

Her boss shot her a menacing glare, but she didn’t even flinch. Katrina was so used to his tactics, and Ryan wasn’t wrong with this idea.

“How many phones have you gone through in this last week alone?” she pressed on.

Kylan sighed and rubbed his forehead, very clearly annoyed. He ran his fingers through his hair, pushing his bangs back in the process. “I only get into fights on Litter that are worthy of my time,” he grumbled.

Katrina very nearly laughed. “Fighting with, what is it, twelve year old’s, is worthy of your time?” she mused, her eyebrows raised in amusement.

“F*ck off. The one yesterday was a damn tyrant,” Kylan insisted with yet another glare aimed her way.

She shook her head. “Sir, did you not hire me because I graduated college with a double major in public relations and business management?” she asked her boss.

Katrina was already exhausted from trying to sway his feelings, but this wasn’t a situation where she could relent, and she knew that. Something had to give, and this was a logical idea.

“I can fire you just as quickly, Katrina,” Kylan reminded her, but his voice lacked any bite. She knew as well as he did, that Kylan would drown without Katrina Morgan. He had gone through enough assistants before her, for him to realize as much.

“Think about it, Sir. You’re thirty-two. You’ve never openly dated anyone. If you pick the right partner, you could appear vastly more relatable and human. Go to a few galas, take some pictures, and post some of those on social media. It makes sense. You’re plenty desirable around the city, among both women and men alike,” she continued to try and sway Kylan.

She knew probably better than anyone, that Kylan didn’t date. She wasn’t entirely certain he even knew how to date. It was impossible for her to picture someone like Ross Corp’s CEO being… Open enough to date anyone. She couldn’t even wrap her mind around the concept.

Sure, she knew he had the occasional one-night stand. She had run into one or two of the women as they left his penthouse when Katrina dropped off his dry cleaning, but that was as far as any sort of relationship going.

Ryan had been sitting silently for the duration of her speech, watching both her and Kylan closely. She wasn’t sure if he would have any more luck than herself, but she looked at him for help. Graciously, he took the hint.

“Kylan, you and I have worked incredibly hard to build Ross Corp from the ground up. We’re in twenty-seven countries, and in almost five-million homes around the world. Several police forces have opted to use our drones. It pains me greatly to see our stocks plummeting and to see you receiving the brunt of the backlash on social media. Would you please at least consider this idea?” he implored Kylan.

Kylan sighed, shoving his hands in the pockets of his immaculately pressed suit, and then he began to pace. Katrina and Ryan, both let him walk for a while. Katrina had said all she could, and now she had to let Kylan process the information. It was how he worked, each time a big decision was involved. This was no different, and perhaps it was an even larger choice than what was normal.

“F*cking fine. I don’t see how this could possibly help the company, but I’m not the PR expert, I suppose,” Kylan looked at her with narrowed eyes, and she flashed him a small smile. “Give me a week to find someone,” he told her and Ryan, looking at both of them in turn.

“Do you need help downloading some dating apps, or something similar? I just need to know your preferences. Woman, man-“ She was effectively cut off.

“Woman, Katrina. And no. I’ll try and find someone the good old-fashioned way, by going to a f*cking bar,” Kylan pinched the bridge of his nose.

She nodded her head. “Sounds good, Sir. If there’s nothing else, I’m going to freshen up before we go to dinner with Charlie.” She stood from her chair and waited to be dismissed.

“Fine.” Kylan waved her away.

Katrina gave a polite nod to her boss, and then she smiled with relief at Ryan, before she left his office.

She didn’t know if this would really work, but she and Ryan were hopeful.

She couldn’t help but feel mildly sorry for the poor woman Kylan was going to marry. He really was an impossible man to get along with.

Chapter 4

Half an hour later, she was back in an SUV with Oscar, waiting for Kylan to make his appearance. Every two weeks, she had dinner with Keith, Kylan’s uncle. He was an angel investor for Ross Corp, and the only thing he asked in return, was to have dinner with Kylan.

Keith was someone that Kylan could tolerate slightly more than others, much like Ryan and herself. Sometimes, he asked her to go to dinner too, and other times he let her go home instead. She wasn’t surprised he would want her involved today, with the extra prevalent shadow hanging over his head.

Kylan finally made his way into the back seat of the car. He sat next to her, with only the middle seat in between them. She gave him a small smile, and he nodded his head at her.

“Did you-“ he began.

She knew what he was going to ask. “Your dry cleaning was picked up and taken home,” she told him calmly.

“And what about-“ he added.

“Your suit for the gala this weekend? Pressed and tailored. It’s at your home, too,” she said with the same calm tone.

Kylan nodded at her slowly, eyeing her carefully. “Right. Good work,” he said curtly.

It was the closest her boss ever came to saying thank you, and she smiled at him again in response.

Twenty minutes later, Oscar was dropping Katrina and Kylan off at the latest upscale restaurant Keith chose. Kylan had the decency to hold the car door open for her, and she nodded at him in thanks as she climbed out.

Keith was already waiting inside when they walked in, and the two of them made their way over to him, Kylan on her heels. She sat down across from Keith, with Kylan on her right.

“Ahh, my dear Kate. You’re still working for this grumpy little shit?” Keith asked her, lifting his glass of a far too expensive Cabernet Sauvignon, and taking a long drink from it.

She laughed and nodded. “I am.”

Kylan scoffed and lifted the glass of whiskey Keith had already ordered for him. “I wanted it neat, old man,” he complained about the ice in his cup.

“I’ll take that one if you don’t want it. I’ll order you a new one,” she offered her boss.

Kylan eyed her curiously before he handed her his whiskey. Katrina drank it easily, wincing as the fiery liquid skirted down her throat.

Dinner went as it always did, with Keith poking and prodding at Kylan relentlessly, and Kylan responding with less and less patience as time wore on.

Katrina entered the conversation where she felt it was relevant, but she spent the majority of the time enjoying her steak and vegetables quietly. It was really the only true draw from these fancy dinners: the expensive food.

She noticed that Kylan was looking at her more so than he usually did. She couldn’t read his expression, as always, but it was making her increasingly more on edge as time went on. She didn’t know what was on his mind, and it was making her nervous.

Finally, she finished dinner, and Keith stood to say farewell. “I still don’t know why you’re working for this one. You could do a lot better, Kate. Does he even pay you well?” Keith asked her, putting on his jacket in the process of speaking.

“He pays me well enough. I’ll forever have a mountain of student debt, but that’s not his fault. It’s just what happens when you have to pay your own way through school.”

Katrina shrugged nonchalantly, avoiding Kylan’s gaze. She didn’t normally discuss her pay with anyone and especially not in front of her boss.

Keith laughed and shook his head. “Give your assistant a raise, you damn brat,” he chastised Kylan.

She felt her face grow warm and looked down at the table in embarrassment. “Really, Keith. I’m fine. Thank you for the dinner, as always,” she told the older gentleman politely.

Kylan glowered at Keith but made no move to say anything at all.

Keith was used to his behavior and simply ruffled his hair, before he turned and walked from the restaurant.

Kylan was looking at her again, and she met his stare this time. “Sir? Shall we go?” she suggested.

He continued to stare at her for a moment longer, and she began to grow self-conscious.

“Do I have something on my face?” she asked him, grabbing a napkin and wiping her mouth swiftly.

“Your face is fine. Let’s go,” Kylan said quietly, standing from his chair and leading the way back to Oscar.

The drive home was silent and Katrina couldn’t quite pinpoint why, but Kylan seemed to be especially tense for the entirety of the ride. When Oscar dropped her off and she offered a goodnight, Kylan didn’t even look at her.

She wasn’t entirely put off by his behavior, but it did make her a little confused.

Finally making her way inside after an especially exhausting day, she kicked off her cursed heels and drew a bubble bath for herself.

Katrina promptly stripped her clothing and soaked in the warm, inviting soapy water for a long time. By the time her skin was properly wrinkled, she had got out and dressed in her usual nightgown. She brushed her teeth and removed her makeup. She finally walked to her bed, yawning the entire way.

She was just about to plug her phone in to charge when she received a text message. By this point, it was nearing midnight, and she was confused about who would be talking to her this late.

It threw her off even more when she saw the message from Kylan. He never communicated with her this way. It was either always through email, an in-person conversation, or via a phone call.

""I have something to discuss with you at our usual meeting, first thing in the morning,"" his text says.

""Is everything all right, Sir?"" she replied.

""Go to sleep.""

She stared at her phone in confusion. Why was he acting so strangely? What did he have to talk to her about, and why was he warning her beforehand?

""Yes, Sir. Goodnight.""

He didn’t respond after that, and she was left feeling restless for a long while before her body finally allowed her to fall asleep.

~O~O~O~

The next morning, Katrina went through her normal routine of getting ready for the day, opting to wear a form-fitting red dress that stopped just above her knees. She chose a pair of black heels and paired the ensemble with a pair of black nylons.

She kept her midnight black hair down, curling it again quickly with practiced hands. She finished her makeup with a bold red lip. Katrina then grabbed her briefcase and her peacoat.

Thirty minutes later, she arrived at Ross Corp., Kylan’s tea and her coffee in hand. She was doing her best not to be nervous about what Kylan could possibly have to talk to her about, but it was nearly impossible.

She couldn’t help but wonder if she had gone too far, with how she backed up Ryan and his idea that Kylan finds someone to publicly date to marry, no matter how fake it should be. Katrina had merely spoken her mind, but Kylan wasn’t always the sort of person who appreciated that kind of forwardness, if at all.

She reached her floor, stepped out, and walked to deposit her jacket and briefcase in her office. She squared her shoulders, took a deep breath, and then finally walked next door to Kylan’s office.

She stepped inside his office, setting his tea down in his usual spot, and then took a seat in front of his desk with her coffee.

He was standing at his window, much like he always was in the morning, and he had his hands in the pockets of his black suit pants. He turned around to face her, and she was surprised to see he was only wearing a white button-down shirt. It was wrinkle-free and tucked in, as usual, but she didn’t think she had ever seen him without a suit jacket before.

The sleeves of his shirt were rolled up to his forearms, and the first two buttons of his shirt were undone. He looked… different, and she fought to avert her eyes.

Katrina knew Kylan was attractive, and she knew that everyone else noticed it too. It wasn’t a surprise, but she never paid him any mind in that regard. It was highly inappropriate, not to mention the fact that Kylan was a difficult man, all around.",1,1731331188.0,Novels,0,1.0,False

Throwaway as I don’t want this on my main.

As the title says. Im 26M incredibly lonely. I WFH, live away from family, close friends. The only place Im regular is GYM and a coffee shop. 

Now, I really don’t like chatting in the GYM as I’m only focused on my workouts. I just don’t like the GYM to be a place to be social. It just doesn’t click with me.

The coffee shop is fairly small with all female workers so I don’t feel comfortable striking up a conversation as to not make them feel uncomfortable in their workspace. As I’m sure they’re tired of countless others trying to talk. 

Other than that, I keep to myself. I like reading, playing guitar and watching football as my hobbies. I do NOT drink or do drugs and I very much dont like bars and pubs. 

There are no events in this small town and I do not have the option to move.

I’m okay with being alone but I just don’t like feeling lonely.

Just wanted to speak this to the world. Thank you for reading..

TLDR - I WFH, no friends and family close by, do not have the option to move and started to feel incredibly lonely. No idea how Im gonna get through this feeling.",1,1731331116.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False
1goryw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask_Bondha/comments/1goryw6/an_unfinished_story/,An unfinished story ,"Seven years ago, my girlfriend and I broke up. She got married, has a son, and we both moved on, though we kept in touch occasionally through texts, calls, and video chats. Early in October, on my birthday, she called unexpectedly. Jokingly, I said it would have been nicer if she wished me in person. To my surprise, she called again and asked me to meet her at Shamshabad Airport that same evening. At first, I thought she was kidding, but she was serious. So, I went.

Over coffee, we caught up for hours, and she shared the issues she was facing in her marriage. After that, she returned to Bangalore. The following weekend, though, she came back to Hyderabad, and we spent the weekend together. I felt uneasy that she left her son with her husband, but she explained that her husband needed to take on more family responsibilities too.

We spent the day at a hotel, binge-watching shows. I casually mentioned some Telugu Reddit pages where people share private stories. She was surprised and suggested, jokingly at first, that we could try it. I was taken aback, but the suggestion led to a moment between us. It was nostalgic but also made me feel a bit guilty, though she seemed genuinely happy to reconnect.

Over time, we continued meeting on weekends, and I started noticing how much effort she was putting into our time together—flying to Hyderabad or even taking long bus rides. She once told me I wasn’t ""marriage material,"" but now she says she sees me as the right person for her. She’s even started divorce proceedings, but I’ve been clear that I’m not ready for marriage. She understands and suggested that we just enjoy traveling together and exploring life as partners, with no pressure to marry.

Next week, she’s returning to Hyderabad. After seeing some content on Reddit, she mentioned wanting to explore a few fantasies together, including group experiences.

Now, I’m feeling confused. Part of me is drawn to her, but another part wonders if this is all moving too fast.",2,1731331087.0,ask_Bondha,8,0.63,False

So I'm starting this early in order to test out the rules before the official start in January 

Why am I doing this 

1. I want to retire in 10 years, I'm very lucky and privileged to have nearly paid off my morgage and will have enough savings to do this, however my mindless consumerism is a bit out of hand and I'm worried this will hamper this plan or I'll struggle with the reduction of 'fun money' 

2. I've been spending the last few years trying to find more contentment in the 'quieter life' and reducing my need to spend money is a further step in this 

The rules 

Replacing items as they have been finished or broken, this includes
• Clothes that can't be repaired
• Cosmetics
• Craft items
• Electronics 
• Books
• Computer games 

Items needed to finish a project, this includes
• Thread,  yarn or craft item that cannot be subituted with another item in the house
• Frames to hang up cross stitch
• Items needed to update or fix in the household 

Free to spend as I wish
• Charity donations
• Meals out or takeaways (only if they are an opportunity to spend quality time with friends and family and not an excuse not to cook)
• Ongoing subscriptions that are needed and used 

Restricted spending
• Max 1 take out coffee per week
• Max 1 consumerable treat per week (piece of cake, bar of chocolate etc) 

Finally up to 4 mindful purchases per month that have passed the following
• I can fully articulate why I want the purchase and how it will improve my life
• It is an item that has been on my wishlist for at least 1 week
• It is the best value and quality I can afford
• One in one out policy for items I have in abundance (board games, household items etc)

I don’t drink coffee and I think while traveling down the rabbit hole I’ve done nothing but confuse myself.

She will typically go to our local 7brew/starbucks and get something like an iced vanilla coffee with oat milk and an extra shot. On our off days she will get something like an Ubbe Latte. The machine I was looking at was a Breville Barista Express Impress. The idea is for her to be able to make her daily coffee in ~15 minutes.

I would say the Express Impress is the top of my budget and I wouldn’t like to go much above that, if at all. I think she would like almost everything to be automated i.e. tamping.

1gorxud,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1gorxud/why_quitting_nicotine_this_time_feels_different/,Why quitting nicotine this time feels different and how my mindset shifted,"  
  
Let me preface this by saying that in order to come to this state of mind, I had to learn how to be nicotine's bitch. The first time ever I tried nicotine was in 2018 with my college friends, I tried a pouch (snus called in Swedish) and I was hooked. I didn't do it religiously at first but things ramped up real quick when the pandemic hit. This is when I started smoking heavily. And since then, I quit and relapsed so many times I lost count. My quitting periods varied from a few days to a week or a few months to a year nicotine free, but one thing was true was that I always came back for more like a little obedient bitch.  
  
I describe myself as a pathetic human being because I wasn't alive when I was using nicotine pouches. I'm 29 and for the past year I've been alternating between cigarettes and pouches, and I've felt miserable. I've simply become way too familiar with how it feels like to be under the influence of nicotine. My eyelids feel heavy, I feel sleepy throughout the whole day but actually can't sleep. When I wake up in the morning to go to work my head and body are still in the bed and feel extremely exhausted and lethargic. I somewhat wake up when I drink a coffee or a Red Bull but that exhaustion never really goes away.  
  
I have no energy to use my bike which is something I thoroughly enjoy. My brain is too numbed to compute past basic tasks at work, I am literally hanging by a thread day in day out. And I hated myself. I'd look at myself in the mirror and I'd feel like spitting on myself for how fucking pathetic and a piece of shit I've become. Imagine feeling this every single day of your life yet you can't stop because after you spit that pouch, you start feeling an imaginary pouch replacing it.  
  
My health stats I track through my smart ring have also gone to shit. Shitty sleep scores, shitty HRV, shitty resting BPM, shitty sleeping cycles, shitty high average BPM daily. Vision is blurry, can't smell shit, apartment is a fucking mess, social life is nonexistent, and I reroute the cause of all my problems to that insidious substance called nicotine. It just makes me feel like a zombie.  
  
I said enough is enough and in October I bought some expensive stuff and had enough food stored in my fridge to last for the rest of the month and had $0 in my bank account. This means that no matter what happens next, I'll never be able to buy nicotine. And I was mentally preparing for when my salary arrives again in November and hold for dear life to not buy.  
  
However, October gave me a lot of time to think about what life is like when not smoking. Just to put it plainly, life is fucking great. I feel alive, I wake up early, sometimes even too early like 6am or some shit, go to sleep early, go bike often just for the fuck of it, go to the office often, I feel like my eyes are truly open now, like I can see, my eyelids don't feel like they weigh a ton, I feel mentally sharp, I think fast at work, talk fast, I even smile more and socialize more and my colleagues said jesus fucking Christ actually what happened are you on Adderall or some drugs and I laughed that I'm OFF drugs but told them I was having a good time.  
  
I have this fire inside me that's burning and is craving for more and more and more, I became extremely curious about so many things and I'm looking up stuff and asking people different questions about different stuff and I'm just restless and full of energy like a kid. I'm even learning a new language now and that's how I keep my brain stimulated. But even when I'm bored, my bitch ass mind would say,""Well... Why not grab a quickie eh? One last one?"" And I internally slap myself in the face and say, ""Really? And give this up?"" More on this later.  
  
My ring stats also slowly started coming back to normal.  
  
These changes are too palpable for me to ignore or pretend they don't affect me. My wellbeing was fixed in just 2 weeks time, it's insane. Like I went from a miserable pathetic human garbage to someone who loves himself and is trying his best to be better.  
  
These changes are too precious for me. I CAN'T go back. I just can't. Like when I have the urge to go back, and I do have these urges, I always catch myself thinking, okay, you pop one quick pouch, you use it, you feel high for an hour or two great, but after that, what comes? MISERY is what comes, craving more nicotine, being enslaved to the substance again is what happens. Allen Carr's book helped me see the light. It helped me seperate myself from the substance.  
  
This is where I have always fucked up. I have always associated nicotine with a certain feeling that I had. I'm gonna eat? Oh a pouch would make the experience 10x better! I'm gonna socialise? Oh nicotine will make me engage more! I'm having breakfast with coffee? Yup, one pouch and I'm completed!  
  
But I blatantly lie to myself. My brain is a bitch to nicotine and is making shit up to rationalise it. Like I'm actually lying to myself that this is beneficial for me when in reality it makes me feel centered for a fucking minute max and what comes after it is plain misery and suffering. Nicotine goes into your blood so fast and leaves it as fast which makes you crave the next hit immediately.  
  
Guys I can't. I can't give in.  
  
Right now, I'd have some shitty moments or some shitty days where I feel like shit for one reason or the other. Last Monday for example I drank so much coffee at work I was awake for 36 hours by the end of which I was extremely tired, and I was thinking, ""Wellp, maybe if i pop a pouch I'll feel better"" but then I caught myself in the act and asked who in the fuck am I kidding, if I pop it I'm gonna feel like shit.  
  
I took a break from work at the office and as I descended, I saw people smoking in front of the building and the smell was fucking awful, I went to the usual grocery store and there's a tobacco shop conveniently placed right next to it. It's a habit to restock on the pouches every time I go to the grocery store and today I had that urge as a force of habit and I said, ""Yeah I don't think so"". My brain was moving like a bullet train and I felt so sharp and I KNOW that if I popped a pouch I'm back to the misery and to feeling slow and sleepy.  
  
I'm having three conversations with my life on daily basis. I'm tired boss. I can't go back to feeling like trash. I need to stay clean, I need to keep going, I'm enjoying life as it is right now, this is what I want to do and this is where I want to be, going back one last time will be the end of me and I see absolutely no reason whatsoever in returning.  
  
TL; DR: The substance is the fucking substance. I'm better without the substance. I do not need the substance to feel anything. I enjoy life and feel what I feel for the sake of it. The substance has no effect and won't alter any income I set to happen.

As he kept looking around, he saw a coffee shop and bought a cup of caramel macchiato-flavored coffee. Ever since he found out about them, it’s been in his innate desires to taste them. After getting the coffee, he sat on a bench overlooking the Hollywood sign and took a sip, spitting it out in the process.

""Oh, that's hot.""

He set it aside and looked at the birds—one of them was about to get killed by the bus! he thought as he saw the imminent future of the bus's movement and the trajectory of the bird. And then, poof. The bird was crushed.

He continued to view everything around him until an unfamiliar voice, with a strong Australian accent, greeted him and asked if she could sit.

Time naturally moved slowly for him, but as he saw her, it became even slower. Like a slug enduring twice the gravitational pull and moving very slowly, he froze.

He replied, ""Oh, yes, why not,"" while looking at her.

""That's odd. She looks very Asian, probably of East Asian descent, and yet she has a strong Australian accent. She must've grown up in Australia... But her looks and vibe feel very Korean... Hmm? Maybe I should test the waters.""

""안녕하세요, 한국에서 왔어요?"" (Are you from Korea?) Ryan asked her.

""네! 와, 한국어 할 줄 알아요? 발음도 정말 좋아요!"" (Wow, you speak Korean? Your accent is really good!) she replied back, with her eyes so wide that you could see the reflection of Ryan's face in them.

""Yes, I kind of learned it, actually,"" he replied, now in English.

""That's nice. Are you from around here?"" she asked, looking at him while taking a seat.

""Nah, I'm kind of new around here.""

I’m insulin-resistant with high androgens, 5’6” and 180 lbs (168 cm / 82 kg). Two weeks ago, I started taking supplements like berberine, inositol, chromium, magnesium, omega-3, zinc, and vitamin D, along with trying to cut down on sugar. The first week was hell—I craved carbs and sugar so badly. I started with 1g of inositol in the morning, and since I felt okay taking all those supplements together, I increased the dose to 3g after the first week. By the second day, my cravings began to lessen, and by the end of the week (now), I’m showing little to no interest in food.

I used to overeat a lot because I was never satisfied with food, no matter how full I was. Now, I still feel hungry, but I’m so satisfied that I don’t crave food anymore and mostly see it as fuel.

Here’s where it gets tricky: I’ve been in recovery from an ED for the past five years. Sometimes it’s harder, but I never let myself starve. But now, the opportunity to restrict is calling to me. I’m still eating, but I think I’m in a bigger calorie deficit than I should be.

I want to lose weight for my health—my doctor recommended it—but it feels so difficult to balance. I’m also scared that this newfound control over cravings will end and my old patterns will come back. I’m about to start taking spearmint capsules (can’t stand the tea taste, I’m a coffee girl), saw palmetto, NAC, CoQ10, and curcumin.

Now, I really don’t like chatting in the GYM as I’m only focused on my workouts. I just don’t like the GYM to be a place to be social. It just doesn’t click with me.

The coffee shop is fairly small with all female workers so I don’t feel comfortable striking up a conversation as to not make them feel uncomfortable in their workspace. As I’m sure they’re tired of countless others trying to talk. 

Other than that, I keep to myself. I like reading, playing guitar and watching football as my hobbies. I do NOT drink or do drugs and I very much dont like bars and pubs.

When I was a child, I thought it was the norm.

It became clear to me that sometimes, the motivation behind the bonggang handaan was either to impress/give in to the pressure (since yun ang nakasanayan)/ (on the positive note) just to be really generous. 

There's one time na walang wala talaga si Mama and she had to ask me to provide money pambirthday ng kuya kong may special needs. Walang wala rin ako 'non so i told her na maybe it's time to have a simple celebration lang? Besides my kuya doesn't really care. It's just that napepressure sya sa mga coteachers nya who were expecting na magpapahanda sya ng birthday.

However, I've noticed two things about it that strike me as a bit odd. 

  
1. Anywhere lower than 5, the dial becomes increasingly stiff to turn - turning to 1 requires some genuine effort. I haven't calibrated it myself since it arrived, but I'm assuming that might be necessary, or a thorough cleaning? There hasn't been any knocking or metal on metal sounds that might indicate the burrs are in contact with each other though.

2. When making pour over using my Hario Switch, despite using a variety of beans from a variety of roasters (though all generally light - medium roast) I so rarely need to go outside of the 5 - 6 range to make good, balanced, clean tasting coffee. Yet I see others that are using vastly wider ranges. I understand different recipes will require different grinds, but I so rarely need to go beyond just a click or two to dial in the coffee perfectly, rather than large sweeping adjustments. Is something off here?

I went on a coffee date with a nice, inoffensive and rather attractive guy. 

The issue is that, despite my longing for a romantic relationship and my fear of ending up alone, I found I was so anxious before and after the coffee date that I almost threw up. I wanted to run away, self-sabotage, lob a grenade into the situation and blow the entire thing up, run and go flirt with a guy I had no intention of dating, who wasn’t this guy. 

I did none of this - I am a firm believer that my own pain and anxiety gives me no green light to toy with the hearts of other people. The question I have now is, does anyone relate to this, does it ever go away, and should I keep seeing this guy? 

My intention is to just get to know him as a friend - That’s what I told him (he didn’t ask me out explicitly as a date, just asked for coffee and bookstore shopping), and we have plans to hang out in the future. However, the idea of dating him makes me feel like I’m being trapped in a tomb and buried alive, to die slowly until my oxygen taps out. Does anyone relate to this at all?

I thought it was all just based on hopes and prayers. That is until I found it. A number or hotline as they call it. 1-800 Karma. 
Ok ok. Scratch that. They found me.


I was engaged in my daily routine of getting ready to leave for work when it happened. I got a notification that I had a new email in my inbox. So, since checking my emails was a part of my end of the day routine, I checked it. My boss had been giving me numerous assignments lately. So I guessed it was a new one to add to that.


When I checked however, it was from a sender I didn’t recognize. 1-800 Karma. No website. Just that 1-800 Karma.
I read the subject which said ‘Orientation’. 


“Great. Another training from my boss.” I sighed. 


I then began reading through the email to see what my boss wanted me to do.  “Welcome to 1-800 Karma Brandon! The place where you can get Karma to take revenge on anyone for you. Who would you like to get back first.” I read. 


“Ha ha, very funny Josh.” I laughed. My co-worker and best friend Josh and I always like to prank each other. So I knew this must’ve been from 


“George would be great.” I chuckled. 


George was my boss. As bosses normally do, he had given me a truck load of assignments for work. Since I worked in an office as a computer analyst, it mostly had to do with computer stuff. 


As I turned off my computer for the day, a cold chill ran up my spine. “We really need to fix that AC.”m


When I got home that night, I was still thinking how strange the email and the sender name was. It looked like a phone number rather than an email name. Whatever Josh did, it was kind of cool how he was able to make the sender’s name like that. 


The rest of the night was normal. We had our regular family movie night. My wife Julie, the kids Anne, Krystal and I sat down to watch one of our favorite movies to watch together. Zootopia. A movie we watched almost every time it was Anne’s turn to choose the movie we watched.


In the part of the movie where Judy and Nick finally find the evil mastermind behind the things that happened in the movie, I remember hearing something odd. Judy the bunny Police Officer seemed to look at me “it’s done.” She said.


It was so odd because I’m all the 100 times I’ve seen this movie with my wife and kids, I never heard Judy say that in the movie before.


 As I was getting into bed, I thought about the part of the movie again. It sent a shiver up my spine because of how weird it was.


“Honey, it’s the start of summer.” Julie laughed getting into bed. “Why are you cold?”


“Don’t worry about it.” I told her before kissing her and heading off to Dreamland. 


I woke up to scream. It sounded like multiple people were either in excruciating pain or dying. I’d never heard anything like it. Well, maybe not never. I did hear it when Julie gave birth to our first girl Anne. 


I jumped up off the ground and stood. Why was I on the floor? I don’t know. But multiple screams made me worried about my wife. All the adrenaline of being worried made me brush off the fact that I was on the floor. 


I started running immediately to the screams as fast as I could so that I could get to where they were before anything could happen. These girls are my life. I wasn’t going to let anything happen to them. 


Then, a big fire appeared out of nowhere. Right in front of me. It actually looked like a demon. You know Jack Jack from the Incredibles when he becomes that fire? Imagine that, but the size of an adult. 


I didn’t care, I just ran as fast as I could toward it so I could get to my girls. Nothing, not even the biggest fire creature would stop me. 


“You’re next!” It shook me. “Wake up!”


“Baby!” I heard Julie scream.


I opened my eyes. It was morning and my wife was in front of me. 


“Some nightmare.” She chuckled. “You ok?”


“Yeah.” I nodded. 


Then, we went downstairs to start the day. Julie made us both coffees and I turned CNN. It was part of our normal morning routine. 


There was a young woman with a microphone in her hand. She was standing in front of chard remains of something I couldn’t see well and yellow police tape.


“I’m Kelsey Robertson reporting from the scene of a massive fire at the Braxton condominium.” She began.


“Isn’t that where your boss and Josh live?” Julie asked from the kitchen.


“Yeah.” I nodded. “But they’re tough. They got out.”


I changed the channel to a more pleasant show. SpongeBob. I needed that more than I needed the news. 


Then I thought of the email I got from 1-800 karma. 


“No. This can’t be.” I thought. 


I shook my head.


“They’re fine.” I reassured myself. “That was just junk mail.”


The rest of the day went on pretty normal. Well, as normal as it could be at least. Complete with a family drive, games when we got back since it was raining and Red Lobster for dinner. 


Throughout the day, I couldn’t get the news out of my head. Why was it there? Why did it happen?


It was a lot harder to reassure myself because it kept making shivers run up my spine. 


While we were playing UNO in the evening, my cellphone began to ring. It wasn’t late so I wasn’t shocked or worried about it. 


“Can you take my turn?” I told Julie before getting up. 


I walked out of the room. 


“Sam.” I began. 


“Hi Sam.” My boss’ assistant Sally replied. 
“Just calling to let you know I moved up to be your boss. And that you’ll be moving to Josh’s former position.”


A cold chill ran up my spine.


No. They had to have moved. Crazy as it seems since no one talked about anything. I would’ve heard something from Josh especially since he was in the cubical next to mine. 


“What happened?” I asked. “They move or something?”


“No, it’s actually worse than that.” She hesitated. “They died last night in the Braxton as you probably saw on the news.”
I knew it. I knew something was up with that email.


But why did Josh die?

1gor967,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeMoneyOnlinefree/comments/1gor967/earning_on_prime_opinion_tips_tricks_and_what_to/,"Earning on Prime Opinion: Tips, Tricks, and What to Expect","I've been using Prime Opinion for a little while now, and honestly, it’s turned out to be a pretty fun way to make a bit of extra cash on the side. You just take surveys to earn points, and when you have enough, you can cash out. Plus, they throw in a few extra ways to boost your earnings, which keeps it interesting! Here’s what I’ve found so far:

**Earn Money by Taking Surveys**  
The main thing here is the surveys. They’re usually pretty quick and straightforward, so it doesn’t feel like a chore. I’ve been doing them during coffee breaks or whenever I have a few minutes. It’s nice to know I’m earning a little something extra without much effort. ☕💸

**Earn by Playing Games: Fun, But a Little Hit or Miss 🤨**  
Prime Opinion also lets you earn points by playing games, which is a cool break from surveys. Some games are pretty rewarding, while others are… let’s just say, more challenging than they’re worth. But if you enjoy games, it’s another way to add to your points while having a bit of fun! 🎮🕹️

**Weekly Raffles: Your Chance at 1,000 Points! 🎁**  
If you fill out at least one survey each day for seven days straight, you get entered into a raffle with a chance to win up to 1,000 points! I managed to snag 500 points (around $5) last time, which basically covered my coffee for the week. So I try to keep up with that streak for a little extra boost each week.

**Leveling Up: Extra Perks Along the Way 📈**  
There’s a level-up system too, which makes it a little more interesting. Every time you level up, you unlock some new features and earn extra points, so it feels like a mini-game on top of the surveys. Maybe one day I’ll hit the top and become the ""Survey King""! 👑😂

**Quick Bonus: Use My Link for an Extra +10% on Surveys 🎉**  
Oh, and here’s a little insider tip: if you sign up with my link, you’ll get a 10% bonus on points for any surveys you do in your first 24 hours. It’s a nice little boost to get started, and we both benefit. Welcome to the club! 🎉

**Leaderboard System: Serious Effort Required 😅**  
They have a leaderboard too, but it’s not for the faint-hearted! You’d have to do a lot of surveys to climb up there. I haven’t made it yet, but maybe one day I’ll be a ""survey warrior"" and work my way to the top!

**Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Points 💳**  
One of the coolest parts for me is that you can actually create virtual credit cards with your points. I made one for Amazon, and it worked like a charm! It’s pretty satisfying to treat yourself with something you’ve earned.

If you’re looking to make a little extra cash here and there, Prime Opinion is definitely worth checking out. I usually do it while waiting in line or commuting, and it all starts to add up. Like they say, “every little bit counts”! Give it a try if you’re curious—you might be surprised by how quickly the points stack up.",1,1731328834.0,MakeMoneyOnlinefree,1,1.0,False

Other than that, I go to a coffee shop regularly as I like the space and the good coffee. I thought to myself I could strike up some conversation with the baristas however they’re all female and I don’t want to come up as a creep or somehow make them feel uncomfortable during their work.

Welcome to the latest issue of the **Technology Metals Report (TMR)**, brought to you by the [**Critical Minerals Institute**](https://criticalmineralsinstitute.com/) **(CMI)**. In this edition, we delve into the critical minerals sector in the wake of President Trump’s re-election, which is expected to lead to major shifts in U.S. energy and trade policy. Among these changes are potential [rollbacks](https://investornews.com/critical-minerals-rare-earths/trump-reign-will-redirect-american-critical-minerals-policy/) on electric vehicle (EV) mandates and new tariffs on foreign vehicles, coupled with a renewed focus on domestic critical minerals. These policy moves could reshape both the U.S. supply chain and global markets, presenting a mix of challenges and opportunities for stakeholders in the critical minerals space.

This week’s highlights capture a snapshot of the global race for critical mineral resources and the strategic shifts that could redefine industry landscapes. The UAE’s [investment](https://www.wsj.com/world/africa/the-new-investment-superpower-outflanking-china-and-the-u-s-in-africa-ce52721c?st=fbNBvA&reflink=article_email_share) surge across Africa has positioned it as a key competitor to both China and the U.S. in this sector, securing stakes in critical minerals, renewable energy projects, and essential infrastructure. Meanwhile, the volatility in lithium prices is posing significant [challenges](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/albemarle-loses-more-than-1-billion-q3-falling-lithium-prices-2024-11-06/) for leading producers like Albemarle, which is recalibrating its strategy amid an oversupplied market and reduced EV adoption, signaling wider impacts on lithium mining and production.

Another important story centers on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s final [ruling](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-department-treasury-releases-final-ruling-section-45x) on Section 45X under the Inflation Reduction Act. This updated regulation expands financial incentives for domestic mineral processing by allowing material costs in production credits, a critical shift for U.S.-based mining and processing companies. This regulatory enhancement is designed to boost domestic mineral processing, a crucial step in reducing dependency on foreign supply chains while promoting clean energy production within the U.S.

Also of note are China’s recent large-scale mineral [discoveries](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3284776/china-hails-mineral-finds-amid-push-security-supply-chain-energy-and-nation?utm_source=email&utm_campaign=3284776&utm_medium=share_widget), including reserves of gold, copper, and molybdenum, emphasizing its ongoing focus on mineral security and self-sufficiency. These discoveries highlight China’s efforts to fortify its supply chains for critical minerals essential to its technological and defense industries. With these developments in mind, TMR provides CMI members with the most relevant updates and insights into the rapidly shifting critical minerals sector.

# SOME HIGHLIGHTS:

**U.S. Department of Treasury Releases Final Ruling on Section 45X** (November 6, 2024, [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-department-treasury-releases-final-ruling-section-45x)) — The U.S. Department of Treasury has issued the final rule for Section 45X under the Inflation Reduction Act, providing critical changes to bolster domestic production of clean energy technologies and their components, including critical minerals. Initially, the proposed rule excluded direct and indirect material costs from production costs, limiting the credit’s efficacy, especially for mineral processors. The revised regulations now include these costs, enhancing financial incentives for domestic mining and processing operations. This change aims to attract more investment to an industry facing stiff global competition and market instabilities. The final ruling also ensures that mineral processors can account for high material costs and must refine eligible components domestically, promoting midstream processing capacities within the U.S. This substantial update addresses industry criticisms and aligns better with the intent to strengthen the domestic supply chain for critical minerals essential for clean energy technologies.

**The War for Critical Minerals and Capital Resources: Technology Metals on the Front Lines of Global Power** (November 5, 2024, [Source](https://investornews.com/critical-minerals-rare-earths/the-war-for-critical-minerals-and-capital-resources-technology-metals-on-the-front-lines-of-global-power/)) — Rare earth elements and other critical minerals are essential for modern technologies, from smartphones to electric vehicles and defense systems. These materials, including Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, and Terbium, are vital for manufacturing permanent magnets used in numerous advanced technologies. Over time, China has secured control over the supply of these minerals, thereby gaining a strategic edge that enhances its global power and technological capabilities. The [**Critical Minerals Institute**](https://criticalmineralsinstitute.com/) **(CMI)** addresses this issue by prioritizing minerals on its “Hit List,” which is based on international evaluations. This list aims to guide strategic efforts to reduce supply chain vulnerabilities and ensure economic growth. By focusing on these critical materials, CMI aims to support nations and industries in securing their technological futures and maintaining global leadership.

# Department of Defense Invests $250 Million in Funds Appropriated by Inflation Reduction Act to Expand Domestic Production of Critical Materials

Since mid-2023, the Department of Defense has awarded a total of $250 million to twelve recipients utilizing funds appropriated by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (Public Law 117-169). The twelve awards, made via the Defense Production Act Purchases (DPAP) office within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy (OASD(IBP)), directly support the objectives of the National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS) by establishing domestic manufacturing capability for a reliable and sustainable supply of strategic and critical materials for large-capacity batteries and other supply chains key to national defense.

“These strategic investments will result in accelerated access to critical materials by incentivizing the establishment, expansion, and modernization of essential items required for defense and commercial systems and the associated workforce development efforts,” said Dr. Laura Taylor-Kale, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy (ASD(IBP)). “Many of these commodities have essential applications in microelectronics, aerospace, and other defense-related sectors as well.”

“Over the last few decades, the U.S. has seen the sourcing of a large number of critical materials shift overseas,” added Mr. Anthony Di Stasio, Director of the Manufacturing Capability Expansion and Investment Prioritization directorate (MCEIP) under the OASD(IBP). “Variable demand, price competition, and multiple other economic forces have resulted in the need to source many critical materials from foreign, often adversarial, nations. These awards reduce our reliance on foreign sources and mitigate severe defense industrial base risks.”

Details on these twelve awards and recipients are included below:

* In July 2023, the Department awarded $37.49 million to [Graphite One](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) (Alaska) to secure a reliable, sustainable supply of domestic graphite materials for producing large-capacity batteries.

Niobium oxide is a precursor to high-purity superalloys in advanced aircraft, rocket systems, and other defense platforms.***

* The second September 2024 award was $19.07 million to [Nathan Trotter & Co., Inc.](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3915604/department-of-defense-awards-19-million-to-establish-comprehensive-domestic-tin/) (Nathan Trotter), of which $16.55 million were IRA funds, to conduct an engineering study and establish a domestic facility to build comprehensive capacity for the smelting, refining, and recycling of tin in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Tin is ubiquitous in both commercial and defense applications such as semiconductors, capacitors, mobile phones, flat panel displays, vehicles, batteries, photovoltaics, bearings, wire coatings, glass, plasticizers, and superalloys for aircraft.
* The third IRA-funded DPA Title III project announced in September 2024 was a $12.88 million award to [Nano One Materials Corp.](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3917579/department-of-defense-awards-129-million-to-increase-production-of-active-mater/) (Nano One) to demonstrate commercial-scale production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode active materials at the company’s Candiac, Québec and Burnaby, British Columbia facilities. LFP cathode active materials are critical precursors in the large-capacity battery supply chain. LFP has considerable advantages for military applications, including high power, advantageous safety characteristics, and a high cycle life. Additionally, all LFP inputs can eventually be sourced in North America, further reducing reliance on foreign sources.
* The final award in September 2024 was $10.00 million of IRA funding for the Energy Storage Systems Campus (ESSC), which is being executed by the University of Texas at Dallas. The ESSC is an MCEIP Pathfinder project to address cross-service and interagency needs in critical minerals and battery supply chains. The funds will help build a shared-use facility outside of Dallas, Texas, expanding the capacity of current battery chemistries while accelerating the development and production of next-generation batteries. The University of Texas at Dallas is leading this effort with a consortium of partners from Department of Energy national labs, the energy industry, emerging small businesses, and universities, colleges, and trade schools nationwide.

With DPA Title III funding, the recipients listed above will significantly contribute to the defense and commercial sectors' transition to more secure sourcing of these materials and a clean energy economy. The $250 million in total funding helps ensure that critical minerals for defense articles are available and enables the United States to guarantee that mineral procurement is not dependent on foreign and potentially adversarial sources. The DPAP office is overseen by the ASD(IBP)'s MCEIP directorate.

***The US Department of Defense (***[***DoD***](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=DoD)***) is taking significant steps to secure the domestic supply of niobium, a*** [***metal***](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=metal) ***essential for defense and aerospace applications. In a strategic move to reduce reliance on imports, the DoD has awarded a $26.4 million grant to Global Advanced Metals (GAM) under the Defense Production Act Investments (DPAI) program. This funding will enable GAM to enhance production of high-purity niobium oxide at its Pennsylvania facility. The investment aligns with the National Defense Industrial Strategy, prioritizing the expansion of domestic production to mitigate supply chain risks.***

# Niobium's Role in Defense and Aerospace

[**Niobium**](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=Niobium), known for its high strength-to-weight ratio and refractory properties, plays a crucial role in aerospace components. Its lower density compared to other refractory metals makes it ideal for reducing mass in systems like jet engines, solid rocket motor skirts, and turbine nozzles. As [**China**](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=China) accelerates its development of hypersonic weapons, the US government has expressed concern about securing a reliable supply of niobium for applications in these advanced defense platforms.The grant to GAM will also enable the company to refine its production processes, integrating new workflows that are expected to increase efficiency. As niobium oxide is currently predominantly sourced from Brazil, this move marks a critical step toward reducing US dependence on foreign sources.

# America's Response to Global Competition

In addition to GAM's efforts, the DoD is also supporting projects aimed at enhancing the cost-efficiency of niobium-based materials. The [**Powder**](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=Powder) Alloy Development of Additive Manufacturing (PADAM) project, led by America Makes and financed by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), is focused on improving niobium alloy production, particularly Nb C-103. This project seeks to expand the supply base while making niobium powder [**feedstocks**](https://www.metalnomist.com/search?q=feedstocks) more affordable and versatile for defense applications.The increased focus on niobium highlights its importance in the defense sector, particularly as the US faces growing competition from nations like China, which is developing hypersonic missiles that rely heavily on niobium components. The success of these initiatives will not only secure the US niobium supply but also support the nation's defense systems for years to come.

**AMES, Iowa -** NioCorp Developments Ltd. has announced the successful production of an Aluminum-Scandium (“AlSc”) master alloy using a metallurgical process that helps to prove out a commercial pathway to potential production of the master alloy.

The AlSc master alloy was produced at Ames Laboratory’s Materials Preparation Center, located in Ames, Iowa, under the supervision of NioCorp engineers and employing an improved production methodology specified by Tactical Alloys, a firm with over 20 years of experience in the AlSc alloy space. Ames Laboratory is a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory recognized as a world leader in the research and development of [rare earth and rare metal materials](https://www.intelligent-aerospace.com/satcom/article/16537761/we-need-a-space-resources-institute), such as scandium. NioCorp commercially purchased the scandium used to create the master alloy at Ames Laboratory’s Materials Preparation Center.

AlSc master alloys are used to introduce scandium into final casting-type and wrought-type aluminum-based alloy melts. Even a small amount of scandium can provide multiple benefits to aluminum alloys, including grain refinement during casting and solidification; improved weldability for minimizing weld cracks and failures; and increased yield and tensile strength of the alloy, which in turn can reduce the mass (weight) of platforms such as aerospace systems, cars, trucks, and buses, thus [increasing fuel economy](https://www.intelligent-aerospace.com/commercial/article/14034458/klm-flying-v-commercial-aircraft) and [reducing air emissions](https://www.intelligent-aerospace.com/commercial/article/16537724/air-travel-emissions-are-high-and-only-getting-worse).

The recent alloy production was the second such AlSc master alloy production test run performed by NioCorp and researchers at Ames Laboratory’s Materials Preparation Center. NioCorp is currently developing its proposed Elk Creek Superalloy Materials Facility in southeast Nebraska, which is expected to produce approximately 95 tonnes of Scandium Trioxide annually once it is constructed and enters commercial operation, according to the Company’s April 2019 Elk Creek Project Feasibility Study. Current global production and consumption of scandium are estimated by the U.S. Geological Service (“USGS”) to be approximately 10-15 tonnes per year, most of which is believed to be produced in China.

When NioCorp’s Elk Creek mine and processing facility are operational in Nebraska, it will establish the U.S. as a global leader in the production of the high-value rare earth element.

In October 2018, NioCorp signed a commercial sales agreement with Traxys North America LLC for up to 120 tonnes of scandium trioxide over the first 10 years of operation of NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project. Traxys is obligated to purchase 12 tonnes per year of scandium trioxide for the first 10 years of the Project’s production, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. That annual amount represents approximately 10 percent of NioCorp’s planned annual production of scandium. Traxys can purchase more than 12 tonnes per year from NioCorp, and the agreement can be extended beyond the 10-year term, by mutual agreement. The contract presupposes the company securing project financing, obtaining all necessary approvals, and constructing a mine and processing facility at Elk Creek.

Scott Honan, NioCorp COO, added:  “Project Pivot is aimed at solving real-world challenges and doing so on an accelerated timeline that happens to line up very well with NioCorp’s plans to come online with approximately 100 tonnes per year of US-produced scandium oxide from our Elk Creek Project in Nebraska.  By almost any measure, the automotive industry has the potential to consume many hundreds of tonnes per year of scandium, and NioCorp will remain focused on supplying the scandium that this large potential market demands.”

**Memory Transcription Subject: Halin, Venlil with a Job! Unknown Job Title**

**Date: \[Standardized Human time\] December 21, 2137**

A gentle touch to my shoulder wakes me from my first peaceful slumber in nearly a full night cycle. My eyes creak open to a lovely face saying *something.* I can’t help but smile and flutter my ears a bit at the sight. She blushes and-

*Thump*

Her tail firmly strikes me across the snout and she turns to exit the room.

“Tiltva wait! What were you saying?”

“I said the car is going to be here in less than an eighth claw! Get up!”

I take a deep breath and stretch my heavy limbs before a prickling pain shoots through my foot reminding me of a long paw to come. Reaching to the bedside table, a couple of pills and a swig of water will hopefully dull the pain for the rest of the paw. 

Rotating on the bed, I swing my legs to the side and with a hefty shove I’m up on my own two paws. I step past the unfortunately obstructive-to-showering mobility boot and make my way out into the hall and to the bathroom. The air inside is soothingly steamy and the water wonderfully pre-heated. *Thank you for going first Tiltva*. After a relaxing time under the powerful water stream, a hard knock on the door interrupts my drying session.

“Halin, the car is here!”

*Speh*

I turn off the dryer wall and rush out of the room into the hallway. Tiltva is standing by the open front door nervously shifting her weight back and forth on her legs. I grab my pack and pad and join her as she is walking to the luxurious hovercar. Same as before, I use my pad to open the doors to the driverless vehicle and input our destination, ‘Little Branson’. The car roars to life and shoots off towards the compound. I stretch out my legs as Tiltva fidgets nervously beside me. *Honestly, I’m pretty anxious myself.*

I take out a wool brush and resume where I had left off in the bathroom. A few tangles out of my leg and-

“Halin, where is your boot?”

“My boot?”

“Yes, the one you need to walk around.”

I can only grimace in return.

I barely eke out an excuse. “It’s fine, it’s fine. I can limp around mostly okay. Besides, it’s too late now to go back and grab it.”

With a scoff, she looks away and flattens her ears in response.

\------

**{Advance time 30 stdm}**

\------

The trusty car drops us off at the front of the compound. A rather uncomfortable walk to the entrance reveals an unfortunate sight, the gate is closed and locked and won't open with our pads. Tiltva’s face sinks into her paws but I spot a dark gray Venlil in a big hat and boots traversing across the site. A quick bugle and he walks up to the gate. I recognize him as the one that had manned the apparel rental when we had first visited. He dismissively points his ears away and shakes his head as he addresses us in a silly accent.

“Howdy folks, sorry but we’re not open fer business just’n yet.”

“Oh we’re not here to visit. Ray hired us yesterday and told us to come in ‘tomorrow’ which means after rest claw right?”

He tilts his head sideways and down, with a surprisingly authoritative energy. “Halin and Tiltva?”

“That’s us.”

He unlocks the gate and lets us through before closing and locking it behind us. He reaches his paw out to us in the human greeting and shakes both of ours. “Name’s, Kam. Nice to meet y’all.”

I gasp and open my mouth to ask the obvious question before a thump on my back from Tiltva shuts me down.

“Obviously not General Kam. Halin, please….” Kam responds by busting into laughter.

Not wanting to spend my first claw on the job getting laughed at, I ask a much more intelligent question. “So Kam, where can we find Ray? He said to talk to him to get started.”

Kam smiles deviously and curiously responds without the accent. “See the middle-sized building back there in the woods behind the dance hall but in front of the other barn? That’s Ray’s house. Don’t bother knocking, just use your pad to unlock the door. He should be around somewhere and if you don’t see him, go wake him up. He *really* likes that.” *Weird but okay. Kam’s presumably worked here for a while.*

After a quick tail and ear flick of thanks to Kam, Tiltva and I slowly make our way past the dance hall and to the wooden house neatly tucked within the lush forest. Following Kam’s advice, Tiltva opens the door with her pad and we silently enter the house. 

We are greeted inside by a large, pitch-black room. A few nightlights and the embers of a real wood fire barely illuminate beautiful wooden walls adorned by various paintings, photos, and instruments. Above the fireplace,[ a large painting](https://www.twoinchbrush.com/painting/red-sunset) of an old cabin by what looks like a Mirror Lake cove hangs magnificently. Other notable decorations are two different red, white, and blue flags as well as a few paintings of cars unlike any I have ever seen before.

A quick glance is all it takes to see that Ray Oakley is nowhere in sight, either in the living room, the attached kitchen, or dining room. *Well, Kam did say to wake him if he wasn’t already up.* I sign “Follow” to Tiltva and we progress down the dim hallway till we reach a door where nearly inaudible breathing can be heard within. On the door are several small drawings on paper and at the top is a little painting with heavily decorated human letters my translator tells me spells out 'Thyla'. 

*Ah, that must be his daughter’s room. We’ll see where else he might be.*

A short tour of the rest of the large house fails to find anything besides more and more car paintings and photos, even in the largest bedroom Ray is nowhere to be found. *Well, this can only mean one thing.* Tiltva and I walk back to Thyla’s room and timidly stand at the door. Reservedly, I reach for the door handle, but before I commit to opening, I look to Tiltva for reassurance. She shrugs back with her tail.

I open the door to the dark room and a nightlight from the hall spills through the threshold to paint the tranquil scene in front of us. On the bed, Ray sleeps sitting up against the headboard with his head resting on his own shoulder. Thin, light colored pelts have replaced his normal attire. On his lap are several pillows and atop them lies the small furry head of a Farsul girl. One of Ray’s hands lies on the girl’s head and the other rests on a wrapped bundle of blankets containing the rest of her body.

Immediately a feeling of guilt pings through me for interrupting the sanctity of a parent cradling their sleeping child but Kam’s words push me forward. Before I can reach Ray’s side to wake him, Tiltva pushes past me and lightly taps Ray with her tail. Ray’s eyes slowly flitter open before they find us in front of him. A small flash of panic races across his face before it is replaced with obvious *annoyance*. 

*Speh*

Ray shakes his head and uses a hand to wave us away from him and points back to the hall. He delicately lifts the pillows and girl off his lap and onto the bed before he softly rises from the bed and joins us in the hall. Silently, he closes the door and walks us back into the great room. There he places a log on the fire and sorts through a bin of sticks before selecting one. He then walks into the kitchen and places the stick on the table. Grabbing a pad off the kitchen counter, he presses a button whose purpose is immediately evident as the blackout curtains start to slowly pull back from the windows but, incredibly, the sunlight is still filtered by an electric tint on the glass. Pointing at two chairs under the kitchen island, Ray looks to Tiltva and I as he gives our first real instructions as employees.

“Wait here.”

Ray walks out of the kitchen and up the stairs leaving us to stew in our dread. Sitting down in the chair, I am rapidly reminded of my non-boot-wearing blunder as pain shoots through my paw but I hold in any groan that threatens to escape. Bravely, Tiltva looks towards me and breaks the silence.

“Hey, we’re fired right?”

“Almost certainly.”

“Do you think we’ll get compensated for the whole cycle or just this past eighth-claw?”

“The contract said we’re paid every half cycle so hopefully an entire one of those periods.”

“Oh that’s nice...” Her ears perk up in false excitement.

“So you think that Kam wanted us to get fired or did he think this would be funny somehow?”

“Probably fired seeing as it would appear we got to work a full claw early.”

I sigh, *hard*. “Damn…”

Nearly as fast as he had disappeared, Ray returned down the stairs, this time wearing the famous pelts he is known for. He strolls past us and stops at a familiar but very different machine on the kitchen counter. Without turning to look at us, he asks a surprisingly comforting question.

“You two want any coffee?”

Not willing to miss being treated to real, human coffee I excitedly nod my head as my tail starts to furiously wag. *Oh yeah, he can’t see us.*

“Yes, please!”

“Black or with creamer or anything.”

*You can put things in coffee!? Set mental reminder for next time.*

“Uhhh, I guess black is fine.”

A button press on the machine starts the gentle whir of a grinder and the lovely sound of boiling water to begin. The energetic fluid soon starts to drain into the pot as Ray turns around and wearily leans against the counter and [hums](https://youtu.be/lFamN-oXRMQ) with his eyes closed. The pot continues to fill all the while Tiltva and I nervously fidget in the increasingly bright kitchen. Soon a light beep signals the coffee is ready and Ray retrieves three beautiful mugs. In just a moment, all of us hold a delightfully warm mug in our paws and hands. I take a happy scenting breath before taking my first sip as Ray begins talking.

“So Halin, Thyla really seemed to upset you at the restaurant when you were here a few weeks ago huh?”

The wonderfully complex tasting drink is spoiled as it is quickly sucked down the wrong pipe, resulting in a sad, quiet coughing fit.

*Brakh me, it is over for real this time. I hope I can figure out swimming.*

I open my eyes to see Ray with a light smile, but tears start to well up in Tiltva’s eyes. Ray looks over to her and quickly drops his smile.

“No no no, it’s fine, really. I was just messin' with you. It’s no big deal, she was being short with you.”

I release a held breath as Tiltva wipes her eyes with her shoulders. Ray takes a deep breath of his own before continuing.

“Sooooo as you can guess, I did some research on you two last night. And while the background check services seem pretty comprehensive and privacy breaching, I thought I’d just ask you two directly to clear anything left up.” He then leans forward across the island and looks between us. “Ready for your interview?”

I skittishly nod my head and ears in sync with Tiltva. Ray nods right back.

“Perfect, let’s start from the beginning. Tiltva, screened for Predator disease at age 5. Stated reason: ‘Self-isolation and anti-herd behavior.’ Is this true?”

Tiltva audibly gulps before answering. “Yes sir.”

A pained smile crosses Ray’s face as he responds. “To think they tried to lock up a child because she was sad her mother died… Well Halin, it says here you nearly got screened yourself at the same time if not for the efforts of your father because you ‘Refused to disassociate with a potential PD patient’ *whatever the hell that means.* Correct?”

*Stars, it’s been so long I’d nearly forgotten.* 

“Yes, it was too late for Tiltva to push me away and she’s been stuck with me since.”

Now a large smile erupts on Ray’s face as he carries on. “Next thing of note is from very recently. Both of you are unemployed as of this past month. Tiltva, from Fireway Peacekeeping Supplies, a now defunct Exterminator supply company, and Halin you from MLCD Pharmaceuticals. Tiltva’s reason is evident but Halin, care to explain why?”

*Here this goes.*

“Sure thing, uhh, well…” *Take another breath and focus.* “Sincerely, I didn’t get the job on my own merits. My Dad called in a favor and I got put in a position I wasn’t ready for. The managers above me were ill-mannered to everyone below. I tried repeatedly to appease them but it seemed to only make them angrier. Eventually, I got my leg here crushed and as soon as I dragged myself back to the officer they showed me the door claiming ‘wrong shipments’ but they didn’t even try to get me on a performance improvement plan.”

I take another breath and look back up to Ray as he starts to chuckle.

“You could’ve just said ‘upper management were a bunch of assholes’ and I’d’ve believed you.”

*Stupid, stupid, stupid.*

“No matter though, I appreciate both of you being truthful. Now, why did you guys barge into my daughter's bedroom and wake me up four hours before normal opening?""

""You said be here 'tomorrow' and Kam said you like to be woken up?""

""Damn him, he's been getting a bit too ballsy lately. Well, last thing of note isn't so much a question, it's just that y’all are not much younger than me. Not important but just more evidence I have trouble guessing Venlil ages.”

Tiltva and I share a confused glance before she speaks up.

“Wait, how old are you?”

“I’ll be 29 come June compared to you two at 22. How old did you think I was?”

“I don’t know, maybe 40s or so? I guess I don’t know human ages either. Halin?”

“Same here, that seemed about right.”

I play with the wool on my neck for a moment before a question of my own pops into my head.

“Ray, if you are 28 doesn’t that make it a bit weird to have a daughter that age? What is she, like 13?”

Ray leans back and rubs his chin as he stares past us, beyond the limits of the room.

“I guess it’d be strange if she was my bio kid, but she’s not, so it’s not. Anyhow, I’m not really sure how old she is. I’ve got a pretty good guess from her doctor’s checkups and talking with a doctor but otherwise she won’t tell us. We're pretty sure she’s in the range of 11 to 13.”

“That’s strange. Any adoptee on Skalga should have basic information like that available.”

Ray huffs in response. “Well, she’d have to be from Skalga and in foster care for that to matter. She’s only been planetside since she left Talsk during the raid on the Archives.”

*Hold up, what? She’s from where? So she’s only been here how long?*

Before I can start another line of questioning for Ray, a small but noticeable thump vibrates the house and the sound of running water starts from the direction of Thyla’s room.

Ray smiles big and continues. “Well speak of the devil. Sounds like the kiddo has woken up. Anything else you want to ask before she washes up and gets out here? When she does, I’ll cook us up some breakfast.”

A light grumble from my stomach reminds me of a so far missed first meal. That aside, there is still too much left to learn about Ray and his daughter. How does a Human adopt a Farsul girl who only recently escaped from a planetary raid?

“So Ray, how is it that you came to adopt Thyla if she wasn’t in foster care?”

His smile slowly fades as he reminisces. “Know that she technically isn't legally my kid yet. Anyway, well, I think I already mentioned I found her under a bridge right?”

Tiltva and I nod and flick our ears in agreement.

“Well settle in for a bit of a story. On a particularly rough day, both for myself and the weather, I was walking around downtown in the rain, soaked to my bones, when I found what I thought was a starved, stray dog underneath one of the bridges. Took a second to register that there are no stray dogs on this planet so I rushed up to find a little kid on death's door, shivering and emaciated. In fear or weakness I don’t know but she didn’t say a word when I scooped her up and tried taking her to an emergency clinic. Emphasis on tried as the first one rejected us, as well as the second.""

*Stars above, there is no way they rejected a Farsul girl right? RIGHT?*

""Probably scared the poor kid the other half to death when I screamed at the staff of the second clinic. Then I rushed her to the UN base hospital where they got her treated. Curiously, she refused the Venlil doctors there, only accepting help from the Zurulians and begrudgingly from the humans. I stayed by her side while she spent a bit recovering, till I thought they’d get her to a foster home or something but allegedly nowhere had room. Suddenly I found myself with an alien preteen living at my apartment just to make sure she didn't end up under a bridge again.""

Ray takes a long swig of his coffee and a set of deep breaths before continuing.

""She was pretty cautious of me for a while, so I let her take the only bedroom. Luckily, Mrs. Oakley was away at the time. At first I thought of it as temporary while this house got finished and they found her a place to live. However, the house got finished first and when I brought her here with me during final inspection, something *flipped* in my head while I watched her happily wander the halls and look into the rooms. I guess you could call it a reverse-flashback? Flashforward? A vision? I don’t know, but I vividly saw myself watching her growing up here, having her own life experiences, coming back one day with kids of her own, and I thought, ‘If I get to spend the rest of my days helping her find happiness and she lets me cheer her on from the sidelines, it will be a life well spent.’”

As Ray finishes up his story, the click of a door comes from down the hall followed by the rhythmic sounds of claws on hardwood. A somewhat familiar voice calls before the speaker comes into view.

“Good morning Dad! It smells weird in here! Like *Venlil!*”

We all turn to look as she rounds the corner wearing a long blue-dotted pink dress before she stops dead in her tracks to stare at myself and Tiltva. A whirlwind of emotions cross her eyes, ears, and tail, surprise, fear, and anger, before finally settling on *betrayal* as her eyes fill with tears and she begins stomping her foot. Ray quickly falls into a frown and lowers his face into his hands.

“Hey kiddo, let’s go back around the corner and try that one again.”

*This is a certified spehshow.*

1goqwkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1goqwkr/1800_karma/,1-800 Karma,"I think we all know what karma is. Occurrences that may or may not be pleasant to people who deserve it. 


I thought it was all just based on hopes and prayers. That is until I found it. A number or hotline as they call it. 1-800 Karma. 
Ok ok. Scratch that. They found me.


I was engaged in my daily routine of getting ready to leave for work when it happened. I got a notification that I had a new email in my inbox. So, since checking my emails was a part of my end of the day routine, I checked it. My boss had been giving me numerous assignments lately. So I guessed it was a new one to add to that.


When I checked however, it was from a sender I didn’t recognize. 1-800 Karma. No website. Just that 1-800 Karma.
I read the subject which said ‘Orientation’. 


“Great. Another training from my boss.” I sighed. 


I then began reading through the email to see what my boss wanted me to do.  “Welcome to 1-800 Karma Brandon! The place where you can get Karma to take revenge on anyone for you. Who would you like to get back first.” I read. 


“Ha ha, very funny Josh.” I laughed. My co-worker and best friend Josh and I always like to prank each other. So I knew this must’ve been from 


“George would be great.” I chuckled. 


George was my boss. As bosses normally do, he had given me a truck load of assignments for work. Since I worked in an office as a computer analyst, it mostly had to do with computer stuff. 


As I turned off my computer for the day, a cold chill ran up my spine. “We really need to fix that AC.”m


When I got home that night, I was still thinking how strange the email and the sender name was. It looked like a phone number rather than an email name. Whatever Josh did, it was kind of cool how he was able to make the sender’s name like that. 


The rest of the night was normal. We had our regular family movie night. My wife Julie, the kids Anne, Krystal and I sat down to watch one of our favorite movies to watch together. Zootopia. A movie we watched almost every time it was Anne’s turn to choose the movie we watched.


In the part of the movie where Judy and Nick finally find the evil mastermind behind the things that happened in the movie, I remember hearing something odd. Judy the bunny Police Officer seemed to look at me “it’s done.” She said.


It was so odd because I’m all the 100 times I’ve seen this movie with my wife and kids, I never heard Judy say that in the movie before.


 As I was getting into bed, I thought about the part of the movie again. It sent a shiver up my spine because of how weird it was.


“Honey, it’s the start of summer.” Julie laughed getting into bed. “Why are you cold?”


“Don’t worry about it.” I told her before kissing her and heading off to Dreamland. 


I woke up to scream. It sounded like multiple people were either in excruciating pain or dying. I’d never heard anything like it. Well, maybe not never. I did hear it when Julie gave birth to our first girl Anne. 


I jumped up off the ground and stood. Why was I on the floor? I don’t know. But multiple screams made me worried about my wife. All the adrenaline of being worried made me brush off the fact that I was on the floor. 


I started running immediately to the screams as fast as I could so that I could get to where they were before anything could happen. These girls are my life. I wasn’t going to let anything happen to them. 


Then, a big fire appeared out of nowhere. Right in front of me. It actually looked like a demon. You know Jack Jack from the Incredibles when he becomes that fire? Imagine that, but the size of an adult. 


I didn’t care, I just ran as fast as I could toward it so I could get to my girls. Nothing, not even the biggest fire creature would stop me. 


“You’re next!” It shook me. “Wake up!”


“Baby!” I heard Julie scream.


I opened my eyes. It was morning and my wife was in front of me. 


“Some nightmare.” She chuckled. “You ok?”


“Yeah.” I nodded. 


Then, we went downstairs to start the day. Julie made us both coffees and I turned CNN. It was part of our normal morning routine. 


There was a young woman with a microphone in her hand. She was standing in front of chard remains of something I couldn’t see well and yellow police tape.


“I’m Kelsey Robertson reporting from the scene of a massive fire at the Braxton condominium.” She began.


“Isn’t that where your boss and Josh live?” Julie asked from the kitchen.


“Yeah.” I nodded. “But they’re tough. They got out.”


I changed the channel to a more pleasant show. SpongeBob. I needed that more than I needed the news. 


Then I thought of the email I got from 1-800 karma. 


“No. This can’t be.” I thought. 


I shook my head.


“They’re fine.” I reassured myself. “That was just junk mail.”


The rest of the day went on pretty normal. Well, as normal as it could be at least. Complete with a family drive, games when we got back since it was raining and Red Lobster for dinner. 


Throughout the day, I couldn’t get the news out of my head. Why was it there? Why did it happen?


It was a lot harder to reassure myself because it kept making shivers run up my spine. 


While we were playing UNO in the evening, my cellphone began to ring. It wasn’t late so I wasn’t shocked or worried about it. 


“Can you take my turn?” I told Julie before getting up. 


I walked out of the room. 


“Sam.” I began. 


“Hi Sam.” My boss’ assistant Sally replied. 
“Just calling to let you know I moved up to be your boss. And that you’ll be moving to Josh’s former position.”


A cold chill ran up my spine.


No. They had to have moved. Crazy as it seems since no one talked about anything. I would’ve heard something from Josh especially since he was in the cubical next to mine. 


“What happened?” I asked. “They move or something?”


“No, it’s actually worse than that.” She hesitated. “They died last night in the Braxton as you probably saw on the news.”
I knew it. I knew something was up with that email.


But why did Josh die?

After over a month of dry weather, it rained this morning. The air felt refreshed, as if **nature was casting its magic** to bring life back into everything. Though it's still not cold, the cool breeze and light rain added a touch of winter's promise. 🌧️

I managed to wake up at 4:30 today, finally beating that unconscious part of my mind that always wants ""just a little more sleep."" Instead, I made myself a hot **Starbucks Pike Roast**—a nice change that felt just right for the weather. Let's see if I can keep this habit going! ☕😊

Walking in Philly was peaceful, the rain and breeze making everything feel a little more alive. But, as always, my mind was busy—*Is it normal to have so many thoughts?* Decision-making has always been a bit of a challenge for me, with my mind constantly weighing two options.

Lately, I'm trying a new approach: **whenever I'm torn between two choices, I go with my first instinct**. For example, should I take the train to work, or should I drive to another office? Instead of overthinking, I'm choosing the first option that comes to mind. Let’s see how this shapes up! 🌅

Here’s a small glimpse from the office—capturing the quiet, productive atmosphere that Mondays bring. 🖥️🌆
