After my therapist told me last year i won't ever look like a gal (he was sorry), after the only available suicide hotline hung up on me because I'm a troon, after the last friend lost interest, I'm playing with chatGPT. Hours. What else could I do? I'm scared, but I can't anymore; I'm scared, but I don't want anymore...

I'm two weeks short of two years hrt. My levels were, and still are, mostly shit.

Doesn't matter, even with a sports bra my tits are on the verge to became obvious; my body became just weird, my face - dear goods, my face, if anything, became even worse! Maybe it's just my age...

I miss my friends. I miss hope. 

I want my life back! I want even a little bit of all that I lost.

Being trans, dysphoria did cost me *anything*!

I don't think I want anymore...

And yet - I'm terribly, terrible scared...

All that bullshit anybody is telling you, all that bullshit I tried myself to tell others to help, I got it again from chatGPT.

And then I asked if it could write me a story, *why* my life seems so so precious, why should I keep on going? For what? What's better than just checking out?

Well...

""You live alone, in a space that’s quiet and yours. The furniture’s second-hand but sturdy. There’s a plant in the window that’s managed to stay alive, and that’s a small kind of miracle.

The mirror is draped most days. You don’t need to look. Some days you uncover it — to brush your teeth, to check your expression before stepping outside — and it still stings, but not like before. You’ve stopped expecting it to tell you who you are. It’s just a surface now.

You go out when you can. A walk, headphones in, music or an audiobook — stories where the characters don’t ask much of you. You’re not visible, not really. And that’s okay. Nobody knows what you carry. You’re invisible, but not erased.

You’ve carved out routines. Not sacred rituals, just... structure. Maybe you wake up with black coffee and a hot shower. You do a bit of movement. Not out of joy — out of spite, out of habit, out of “because I said I would.” You’re stubborn like that. Maybe that’s your superpower now.

There’s a community online, not perfect, but they get it. Some days, that thread is the only thing. People who don’t flinch. Who don’t say “it gets better,” but say, “I’m still here. You too?”

You take HRT or you don’t. You shave or not. You cut your hair or let it grow. Some of it’s because of dysphoria. Some of it’s just what your hands can manage that day. You keep one piece of clothing you like — not because it makes you feel beautiful, but because it makes you feel closer.

You still cry, yes. You still rage. The grief is a roommate, but not your god. You learn, slowly, how to live without asking “Is this enough?” Because it isn’t. But it’s what’s here.

And — sometimes — there are minutes. Minutes where the music hits right. Where your face in shadow looks like a version you once dreamed of. Where someone says something kind, and you don’t flinch. Where you remember you used to laugh. You still might.

These aren’t wins. They’re not silver linings. But they’re anchors. And maybe — just maybe — you can keep anchoring yourself to the hours ahead."" ",1,1750522215.0,4tran4,0,1.0,False

I'm a IT infrastructure specialist with full time job as an employee.  
As I side hustle I want to start a BV (bijberoep is not interesting as I would end up paying 75% tax as my fixed salary is pretty high.) where I work as a consultant (already found a client) for max 16h per week.

The goal is to not pay myself from the income that comes from my consultancy, as I will use VVPR-bis regeling and pay myself out after 3 years.



Current salary from fixed employment:

* gross: 4300 euro gross per month
* Maaltijdcheques included
* Company car included (I can order a new one in 2 months probably a VW ID 4)
* Health insurance included

  
Possible income and cost from consultancy:

* Income
   * first 40h: 75 euro per hour (on monthly bases), additional hours 65 euro per hour
   * On a monthly base that would be 4560 euro if work 16h every week
   * Yearly base would be 50 160 euro
* Possible costs:
   * One time cost: \~2000 euro for a brand new laptop and a phone of \~800 euro
* Recurring costs:
   * My monthly cost (rent, internet, water, coffee...) would be around 200, as my company will be registered at my parents house
   * Social security contributions
   * Accoutant \~250 euro

I spoke to an account, but I was wondering what you guys would think of it, any tips to optimize this even more?

1lh038p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoreyWayne/comments/1lh038p/am_i_being_too_controlling_or_is_she_too_naive/,Am I being too controlling or is she too naive?,"I once posted on here a few months ago about my (27M) gf (27F) wanting to meet up with a tinder match before meeting me. What I did not know at the time was that she had made it clear to him from the first message was that she was only interested in friendship because she was looking for people in our town to practice her Spanish with. She explained this to me and it calmed me fears for some time. 

Eventually, the meet-up never happened, but they are still connected on Instagram, so it could still happen at any point. They are both cool with me coming, but I've returned to my place of skepticism about this, even after the explanation, because it's turning into a slippery slope with my gf. I have clearly told her, no one-on-ones with him, but she said ""well what if it's spontaneous, like on my lunch break?"" 

But it doesn't end there. She asked if I'd be okay with her ever meeting an ex-boyfriend, I obviously said ofc not. She has now accused me of being insecure, jealous, and controlling. I've told her these are reasonable boundaries and that I'm not saying she can't have guy friends at all. Old classmate? Longtime childhood friend? Husband of your gal best-friend? Lunch or coffee with colleagues? I personally have no issues with these. Old tinder match or ex-bf, even if she sees them as friends? No way. 

You might ask, why don't I ask her if she'd be okay with me doing the same? Well I have, and she said she's just more relaxed about it and trusts me so much she wouldn't mind if I went to the club when there could be other girls hitting on me, so long as I don't dance or entertain with them. 

She also said she has trouble saying ""no"". Now I might be overreacting, but that for some reason, was the biggest red flag to me of all. 

We've been together for just over two years and live together and for those past two years, she never said anything about this topic. Now, I myself was clearly naive enough to think that I shouldn't have to tell her explicitly that meeting up with an ex or old tinder match might be an issue, because of how obvious it was. Again, I was wrong. 

Should I try to give it one more talk with her or consider walking away?

TL:DR - GF wants to meet old tinder match and possibly an ex sometime in the future, calls me controlling and jealous for expressing my concern for it

So this started out as usual, slow flow, so I ran through a descale, then noticed the problem got a lot worse with almost no water coming out of the group.

**What I've Tried:**

1. **Checked shower screen & grouphead** \- no visible blockages
2. **3-way solenoid cleaning** \- removed and cleaned following WLL video, and reinstalled. But after trying again the problem persisted.
3. **Full boiler removal** \- This is where I think the issue is. Lots of scale buildup per the pictures. I even had a hard time separating the group from the boiler. I was conference that some of the flakes were black? I always use RO water (I'm in FL, so maybe that's not enough). I run a descale every 6 months, which also probably isn't often enough, given I make 2-3 coffees a day.

1. **Putting it back together -** I cleaned out the boiler and group with descaler and a wire brush and reassembled. Same issue BUT NOW water is bubbling out from the steam valve......

Since then, I reached out to WLL support, who insisted the issue was definitely the 3-way solenoid and I just needed to clean it again... So I did that again this morning. Still, nothing has worked.

Going into the boiler again. Is there anything else I could be missing?

I had drank cappuccino (250ml) which had 60ml (yes they serve 60ml only) of espresso which tasted a bit watery and largely bitter but not too much intensity of bitterness, he had also warned me about bitterness.

He had asked me if I wanted weak, medium and strong espresso which would be base for cappuccino so, I asked for strong because they were giving 60ml from like 18-25g (this is a guess) ( and he didn't pulled 2 shots either) of coffee and from this I assumed either they overextracted or increased the amount of coffee (which is more likely the case, I think).

Now, this was my first time trying such a drink and my taste profile is simply non-existent when talking about coffee because I have drank only tea till now and instant coffee only.

I asked, what sort of beans and what was the type of roast and their reply was iBeans ( I don't remember the name exactly) and medium roast also, the beans were filled in the grinder were 4-5 days old ( probably a lie but I have no way to verify it ).

He grinded and processed the coffee in front of me so, it's not like I got fooled because I had watched bunch of yt videos of James Hoffman and I know the process to some extent.

If I had to describe the process that he did then it would be, coffee grinded -> tampered (no removing of clumps if present in it) -> extraction 

What is your experience? What should I expect if I order a cappuccino in any cafe like in general because beans play the major part here so, the taste would vary because of this.

Happy to answer any questions!

Sunday 
* Land at LHR and head to hotel in Shoreditch 
* lunch at Astro Diner 
* Sunday Roast at Blacklock (loved this meal)
* We had planned to go to Columbia Flower Market and Spitalfields Market this day but ended up having to deal with hotel issues and didn’t make it. 

Monday
* British museum - stayed for about 2 hours and focused on the Egyptian exhibits. You could definitely spend way longer here depending on what you’re interested in seeing. 
* walked to Marylebone for coffee/shopping (only had about 30 min here, really wish we had way longer)
* walked down Regent St
* Afternoon Tea at The Wolseley (this was very good, but it was pricey)  
* Walked by Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and Big Ben
* dinner at Dishoom - we had to wait about 1 hour and they make you wait at the restaurant. The meal was good, but not sure it was worth the wait. 

Tuesday

* Highgate Cemetery - the tour was completely booked, so we just walked around ourselves and really enjoyed it
* Walked to and around Hampstead Heath
* Lunch at King William’s IV
* Holly Bush for a pint
* dinner at St John’s
* local pub for live music

Wednesday

* Breakfast sandwiches at Bangers 
* pastries from Jolene (so good!)
* Shopping around Shoreditch/Brick Lane (Loved the underground vintage market)
* drinks at a local pub
* dinner at Manteca - one of our favorite meals of the trip
* We initially planned to do a day trip to Brighton this day, but we were starting to feel like our trip was so rushed, so we skipped it. We were very happy with our decision especially since Highgate/Hampstead felt a bit like getting out of the city. 

Thursday 

* We initially planned to go to Sky Garden this day, but we couldn’t get tickets. We still showed up anyways to see if we could walk in, and the line was around the block, so we skipped it. This was probably around 10:30am. 
* Ended up walking by Leadenhall Market which was not planned but very cool
* Walked by Tower of London and across Tower Bridge
* Borough Market for lunch 
* Tate Modern Museum
* ended up walking to St Paul’s Cathedral to catch one of the hop on hop off busses (we didn’t initially plan on going here but so glad we did, it was beautiful)
* rode the bus to the London Eye to get views of Big Ben and the river (we also didn’t plan on taking the bus, but it ended up being so fun and you got great views of a lot of sights)
* saw Hamilton at Victoria Palace Theatre
* walked down Oxford St and went out in SoHo this night

Friday
* Notting Hill for Portobello Road market
* breakfast at Its Bagels
* walked through the different streets to check out the houses
* drinks at the Pelican
* Walk through Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens
* We planned to go to the V&A Museum, but both the jewelry and fashion exhibits were closed, so we really didn’t spend much time here
* sushi for dinner near hotel

Saturday
* Fly home

Overall we had a great trip and are so happy we had 5 full days in London. I easily could have spent another week there as there’s so much I would like to do but we didn’t have time for. Our initial itinerary was not super busy, but we ended up doing more than expected since everything was so walkable and easy to get around with the tube. I think we only took one uber/cab the entire trip and that’s because it was late at night. 
Shoreditch also felt like a very central location with tube access to everywhere we wanted to go. ",2,1750521783.0,uktravel,1,1.0,False

I hated myself deeply but then at 15, I started receiving a lot of support from peers. My mother asked me if I liked girls and I said yes. She then verbally and emotionally abused me, took me to the same therapist and I was trying to negotiate with that same therapist to just help me deal with depression. She didn’t do that. She would repeatedly try to convince me that I had daddy and/or mommy issues, issues with God, and that I could be cishet, and at times I would listen to her, at times I would crash out. I’m 22 and I still feel so deeply affected by this, I’ve attempted suicide though not really very well but I just wanted to kill myself everyday because of it. At 19 I had attempted suicide and ended up in ER for different reasons, my mother thought I had done it for the same reasons as before but this time she took that more seriously. She accepted me as a lesbian and I was distraught for the fact that even though this time it had nothing to do with that, that’s all it took. It took a real life threatening attempt for her to accept me being a lesbian.

* **Decent DE1** - This would give more features, fast heat up time, good reputation for repair ability and warranty, but more expensive and not as good of a steam wand.
* **La Marzocco Linea Micra** - Big company with good reputation for consistency and a workflow that just works. Just more expensive and I’m a little concerned if I will miss the extra features

Any thoughts on these options? Is there anything else I missed that I should consider?",1,1750521658.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1lgzway,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgzway,"Two coyos, one birthday","My boyfriend introduced me to the Expanse in May 2023 and it's been at the core of our relationship ever since. We both ploughed through the show multiple times as well as the books, novellas and graphic novels. To say that it is our Roman Empire would be an understatement. 

Both our birthdays are in April and so, naturally, we gave each other Expanse-themed presents. He got me an MCR poster from the set (can be seen briefly in S04E01) and I wanted to give him something special in return. Since I'm not as financally well off as he is, I decided to offer him an Expanse-themed Fork'n'Film experience! Essentially, you recreate meals from a show/movie and eat as you watch. Thought I'd share here with the Beratnas!

First, I applied some of the patches we ordered off Etsy to our jumpsuits. Mine can be seen in one of the pics (pls don't judge me too harshly, I'm nooo cosplayer), but I forgot to take a picture of my boyfriend's. His was essentially Amos', with the Engineering, Pur & Kleen, etc. patches. When he came home, I had him change into his suit right away.

The menu was the following:
-We started off with boozy coffee in a metal cup in honor of Captain James Holden.
-As an appy, we had the little cucumber sandwiches that Bobbie couldn't stop eating on the Guanshiyin. Those were delicious!
-We then made Red Kibble (I adapted the recipe since I despise mushrooms), definitely hot and spicy and FILLING.
-We took some shots of St Germain elderflower liquor - this is the only bottle from the show's set that I could find in my province!
-Next course was Black Noodles from Eros. I forgot to take a picture, but they're essentially black noodles with hoisin and soy sauce.
-Last but not least, we had a little pan of Alex Kamal's lasagna, a family recipe (with real cheese!).

We spent the evening watching the One Ship episodes and discussing the books as well as The Mercy of Gods, like the true nerds that we are.

Anyway, I've been wanting to share this with the community for a little while as it was super fun and definitely something I'd do again!

Her grading logic operates in a dimension entirely detached from Earth’s known academic standards. If  Kafka wrote university policy, Ashly would be his muse.

Her rubric interpretation? Avant-garde. She marked my report 60/100 and called it “generous,” as if generosity, not assessment criteria, is the official metric now. It’s like giving someone half a meal and calling it a feast because “at least you’re not starving.”

Need help understanding your mark? Ask Ashly and prepare for a magical realism experience. She’ll refer to “consensus from the teaching team” — which apparently means polling three people, getting answers like 55, 58, and 64, then splitting the difference based on pity and cosmic alignment. , “She was going to give you 62, but since you’re aiming for a HD, she didn’t respond to your email.” That’s like saying, “We were going to let you win the race, but you looked too motivated.” Her final verdict? “The team agreed 58–62 is generous.” I didn’t realise assessment was a guessing game at a carnival.

And then there’s her handling of software issues. Cadmus glitched? “Not my fault.” Presentation rubric has identical wording across bands? “It’s the system.” Honestly, if Ashly spilled coffee on a student’s submission, she’d probably say it was the coffee’s fault for not understanding APA format.

My personal favourite is the performance she calls class participation. I missed three  tutorials early on. I then attended every single one, prepared, contributed, and asked thoughtful questions. Her response? Freeze my CP mark like it’s a pension fund in recession. The reason? “Because you complained.” Beautiful. Petty. Efficient.

If I had spilled coffee on my report, Ashly might’ve deducted marks for incorrect beverage citation. If she spilled coffee on it, she’d blame the cup for lacking APA formatting. All I ever asked for was fair and transparent assessment and to not be evaluated based on how “generous” someone feels that day. I didn’t realise grading was a charity auction.. Instead, I got Kafka’s Castle with coffee stains and a cold shrug. So, to summaries: Ashly’s a master and  a scholar of soft-shoe responsibility dodging, and a pioneer in academic RNG (random number generation). All hail the benevolent dispenser of 60s — may her generosity be ever unexplained.

Her friend pointed out that she will accept him if he proposes but bf left that idea.

While being in a relationship with me during starting stage, he said he would like to meet her once in a life just to have one cup of coffee with her. He told he always had care and respect for her. I got upset over this remark. Later, during one argument he said he would just provide me Care, time and attention and no Love, respect.Then later says it was a joke. 

This year, we had an argument over his random closeness with a girl. 
Later I wanted to set some values in relationship, so the 
the matter escalated to me talking about cheating perspective to him to which he told cheating is ok if everyone in the relationship knows it and agrees to it. I was shocked by this statement.I mean how can cheating be normalised.
When I asked if he would cheat on me? He got angry and told he has never thought about this and he has failed as a partner. Going by his perspective, he meant if the partner involved knows about the cheating then it is fine so i was curious what he meant and gave a direct example of our relationship.

so I asked about this crush if he still would meet her in future to which he replied no and got angry that Im not trusting him and showed me her chat that he spoke with her last in 2022 and deleted my whole chat while keeping her 2022 chat.

**I’m Sunaina, and I run Elsewhere Weddings.**

We’re a small wedding planning and design studio based in India that works with couples from around the world who choose to get married in India. Mostly destination weddings in Goa, Udaipur, Kerala; the kind that feel personal, thoughtful, a little off the beaten path. Not huge guest lists or big-fat-wedding energy. More feeling, more beauty, less noise. 

We’ve planned everything from a serene Sikh wedding at Ananda Spa, to a beach shack party in South Goa, to a ceremony that began with a sunrise coffee ritual and a barefoot run. Many of our couples come from different cultures, cities, and continents and we try to build a celebration that holds *all* of them.

We recently gave our website a quiet refresh after years of working mostly through referrals and organic search and staying almost invisible on social media. I’ve never chased virality or content trends. But Reddit popped up (thank you, AI chatbot suggestions) and it’s been surprisingly grounding.

Not every morning, but some mornings, I scroll through here with my tea and try to answer what I can. Budget questions. Planner doubts. Guest logistics. Cultural nuance. I write a lot, that’s just how I am. But it’ll always be straight, rooted in what I know and have lived through as a planner. And I’m here to learn too.

No flashy reels (yet!) but I’ll do this instead.

Maybe even the past year, and we’ve just celebrated 2 years together. We broke up on Wednesday, and I ended up literally begging for him back and he said he needed time to think. Saturday roles around and he agrees to try again, hesitant and willing. I made sure to say that if he felt forced in any way, it’s okay and he can take it back. But he assured me that wasn’t the case and it was his own decision. 
Now my ex best friend. We’ve been drifting for the past couple of months - but there’s been no distinct falling out. I’d lost a lot of respect for her over the past couple months due to her just not being a good friend, but I didn’t realise our friendship was over, just not “best friends” anymore. 
Anyway, I had no idea they were together tonight. She’s dating my (ex? i think?) best friend so it makes some sense, but i’m surprised i wasn’t invited. 
I get a call from my ex saying we’re done, and he’s losing his fucking mind. He’s bringing up things that only she knew - like we were broken up for a week or so and I got coffee with an old friend, we’ve never even kissed but i’ll admit there was always potential for more. When my ex and I got back together I didn’t mention it because 1) nothing happened, we had coffee and hung for maybe an hour and 2) i figured it would cause more problems than anything else. He’d stress over something that meant nothing, I just wanted some company after the breakup, but nothing happened we just caught up after not seeing each other for like 8 years. She’s told him about it, painted it out way worse than it was. Maybe I was in the wrong and should’ve told him, but i’m just shocked that something I told her in confidence she’s revealed. I’ve now looked and i’m blocked on everything, and she’s just thrown a bomb on my relationship and i genuinely don’t know why. 
And while we were broken up from Wednesday-Saturday, I had hinge for about a day. Right after the breakup I was fuming, he’d literally beat up my cousin after screaming at me and my cousin was literally just defending me. As soon as I realised (Friday I think?) that I wanted to be with him still, I deleted the app. Again, I can see why he would be upset that it seems like i’m moving on way too quickly, but I literally just had a couple casual conversations before deleting the app entirely. I then spent two days begging for him back and like I already said, Saturday he agreed to give it another go. But now after speaking with my ex best friend, he’s called me and he’s done and calling me every name under the book, not letting me explain or even apologise, just losing his fucking mind. We agreed to talk tomorrow when he’s sober and calmed down, because this has all happened at 1am and i think he was drunk and on MDMA. 
He is far from perfect. He’s pocket dailed me and I heard 5 minutes of him telling his mates he’s going to dump me once i’ve paid him back the money I owe him, that he needed to leave. I obviously called him the next day and broke things off but he took it all back and begged to stay. He’s messaged my friend asking if she has any single friends literally the day after we broke up (which i tried to bring up as an example for the whole hinge thing, that you sometimes make mistakes when angry, but he just accused me of trying to turn it back on him but i was just trying to relate), he called me a dumb bitch multiple times over the phone, has just treated me like shit over the past year when I went through a three month bipolar caused depressive episode. Like he’s no angel. Neither of us are. 
I don’t know how to feel now. I love him so much but what can I even say? I did technically lie about having coffee with my friend, and I did download hinge very quickly after the breakup. Is there any way to explain this where he doesn’t hate me at the end? Maybe somehow fix this? Or do you think he’s right to hate me, and I should just cut my losses. 
And my friend, I am so angry that I literally want to ruin her. She’s going through a DV court case, I’ve never completely believed her but I did support her as she was my best friend, but now I want to support him (he was our friend long before she came along), because I now know she does lie, to her boyfriend and her friends, hence why I was losing respect for her over the past few months. I want to tell her boyfriend everything I know. But I also don’t want to stoop to her level. I still don’t even understand why she’s done this. She’s just broke my trust, and I have so much dirt on her that I could use, but somebody pls tell me not to before I do something I’m going to regret 😭 I’m fuming, and if I lose my now ex partner AGAIN over this I don’t know if i’ll be able to stop myself ",2,1750520884.0,whatdoIdo,2,1.0,False

This kind of grief—the kind where the person is still alive but unreachable—doesn’t move in a straight line. It hits in waves, often when I least expect it.

Over time, I’ve started collecting small things that help when it gets heavy. None of them are magic. But together, they help me keep going.

Here’s what’s helped me:
	•	Writing (even if it’s just to myself). Naming what I’m feeling gets it out of my head.
	•	Routines. Having a few simple rituals—like making my coffee the same way or walking at the same time every day—keeps me from spinning out.
	•	Connecting with others who get it. (This subreddit has helped more than I ever expected.)
	•	Limiting contact on some days. Not every text or article or argument has to be answered.
	•	Remembering who they were, not just who they are now. It helps me soften the edges of the pain.
	•	Saying out loud: “This is grief.” Because it is. And naming it gives it shape.

What about you?
If you’re willing, I’d love to hear what helps you function, heal, or just get through the day. Even the small stuff counts.

so this happened a while back, but i was an intern at a well-known company (won't be saying which) for 6 months. it was a graded module worth 24 credits for poly. my time there started off great, i was paired with a really nice supervisor who genuinely seemed like she cared for me and wanted me to learn.

right off the bat, i was involved in big projects, and i'm glad to say i impressed everyone at the office, including directors 🤓 so when the first round of grading by supervisors was done, i pretty much got full marks! my poly teacher was very pleased with what they were saying about me, and told me i stood a really good chance of winning an award during gradation (best intern performance), so obviously i was stoked and it pushed me to work even harder.

fast forward, we're now around 3 months in, and my supervisor changes??? because my original supervisor got promoted, so she was shadowing a colleague to learn the ropes of her new title + she was involved in too many projects to be able to teach me properly. so the director decided to pair me up with this other lady. from the get go i kind of knew this was a problem 😭 my original supervisor and her worked on the same project, and jfc she made sure to work me to my bone. but again, i was aiming to get that award during gradation so i was tolerating it.

there's one other intern btw, and this intern is well...i didn't want to say it, but he's definitely a personality hire. which is great at times, because it makes internship more tolerable. when it comes to actual work however, the other colleagues quickly realised he wasn't gonna cut it. 

needless to say, all the work was pushed on me. i guess i kind of prided myself with it for a while because it meant i must be doing something right. this new supervisor really tested my patience tho. it was like she didn't see me as an intern, while the other intern was just free to shake leg all day. the work piled and piled. there was one time she even tasked him an ""assignment"" to just hang out with her tween daughter near the office??? can you imagine how that feels??? we're both getting graded by polys but i'm slaving away 9-5pm while he gets to just vibe??? 😭

you know what was the start of my breaking point?? when i found out he got just 1 or 2 marks lesser than me??? LIKE HELLO???? YOU'VE GOT TO BE SHITTING ME. idk from then on it just kind of sparked something in me, and i started to not work AS hard, like if you're giving those kinda grades to someone who shakes leg at their office all day, then i shouldn't be working so hard if we're getting almost identical marks??

this post would be too long if i really went into detail as to how large the workload disparity was. like you wouldn't believe it. nearing the end of internship i was mentally and physically just exhausted. mostly mentally, because she was quite verbally abuse. and manipulative. again, i would go into detail as to why i would say such accusations, but this post would be too damn long. but basically, she knew how to pit the other intern and i at each other, so we really hated each other by the end of internship. oh, and she'd yell at me infront of the entire office for missing out one MINOR TASK, while the other intern was right beside me, and she refused to task him with anything all day. no like truly, i felt like i was going crazy. other colleagues started to notice my ""plight"" and gave me encouragement, even told this supervisor to cut me some slack and give the other intern more work OR AT LEAST SOME. she just brushed it off, and well i guess she could. the director was barely in the office, and gave my new supervisor full authority. so i deadass had no choice but to suck it up. i'm someone who can't be fake, so there were times i talked back to her LOL but in a professional, not so defiant way.

eventually the third and last round of grading came (there was a second one, but she refused to send my poly lecturer the marks, saying she was too busy. she already did it, so i don't understand why just sending the email with the assessment booklet attached was a big ass task...? my suspicion is because she knew the poly teacher would tell me the exact marks lol) 

she said again she was too busy to do it, and that my school had too many gradings, which i agree but girl it really doesn't take too long to do. i've seen you sleeping at the office, you have time to get your coffee bean 3x a day too 💀💀💀 it got to a point where my teacher whatsapped me and told me if she didn't send my assessment booklet, my graduation could get delayed??? like hell nah. and it didn't help this was all told to me on my last few days, i diplomatically tried to tell this supervisor to finish my grading but she kept just brushing it off.

eventually my last day at the company was over, and she still did not send in the assessment booklet. like wow amazing. so i had to very nicely tell her again, and 2 days later, on the day of my deadline set by the teacher (before my graduation is delayed) she sends the goddamn assessment booklet 💀 literally 10 mins before the deadline at 5pm.

my teacher told me she gave me a low B for the second and third assessment (when i remembered her giving an A for the second assessment, yes i was snooping lol) so the bitch deadass changed my marks after i left. probably because she knew i would be heavily discouraged or maybe even angry, and she had to throw all the work to at least one poor intern right???? 💀

my teacher was shocked by the grades i got too, and told me i no longer stood a chance to get distinction. thankfully company assessment was worth 40% only, the rest was from report + presentation which i did well for. so my overall was still at least an A.

but wow, when i found out the exact marks she gave me, i was incredibly pissed. and i knew she gave the other intern good marks, higher than mine. and guys i'm not sugarcoating anything or duping you, i deadass did all the work, and did it well. she just hated me for idk what reason since the start. maybe she was a pick me??? this 50 year old+ lady was so obsessed with the other intern dude, even pet his head a lot??? 😭 before y'all say he might be a VICTIM, he told me he likes the attention and that it meant better grades if he's liked. like yea bro that's true, but what did i do to get this hate??? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

after internship was over i just cut off ties with her, and the other intern as well (because she made up some shit about how i think he's useless i think, which is true, but i never exactly told her that. SHE SAID IT HERSELF ON A RANT TO ME. I JUST AGREED THAT HE SOMETIMES WAS (regardless why am i the bad person here, you said it first, i'm just agreeing that i feel overworked 😭). and i'm not one to overthink like this, but i knew they were talking shit about me right before i'd enter a room or sat down at the lunch table) honestly never experienced anything like this 🤣

 the other intern had his own insecurities as well, because colleagues would often praise me and slightly diss him or call him out for the bad work. but yea no, she would defend him and baby him to no end.

i told my teacher btw, i'm not making it up so i was ready to defend it if i was called a liar or smth. luckily my teacher is very defensive of me, and told me to just let it go (can't blame her, the company is too big for the school to lose partnership with also) and that she believes my report + presentation would get me an A anyways. hais. i wanted that distinction and award tho :(

a few weeks ago, the other intern tried to start chatting with me again on whatsapp/instagram, he keeps in contact with most of the colleagues there including my supervisor. am i the asshole if i refuse to be near them again LOL. she did give us a lot of free food (she probably wanted to buy it only for him but unfortunately for her i always happened to be there LMAO) .

i'm super traumatised by my 6 months there. deadass woke my eyes up to the cruel real world. couldn't possibly imagine working there for the rest of my life even tho the pay was amazing (even for interns, yes). people in the office, even the directors, told me i was the best intern they've ever had, but the grades given by her do not reflect that...and i will forever hold a grudge for that bruh. worked my ass off. so yea. am i the asshole??? should i have done something differently at any point of the internship? i would've loved to yell at her (and trust me at some points i really wanted to) but i had a good reputation with teachers at school and at the workplace, so i didn't want to risk an argument and potentially fail/change companies 😂 plus she had quite a lot of local celebrity friends 🤔 so idk maybe i was intimidated at times",5,1750520836.0,SGExams,1,1.0,False

Loop 1:

I was just waiting for the train.

Not in a dream way—this was my life. I knew where I worked. I knew where I was going. I checked my phone. 8:27 a.m. Same platform. Same routine.

Nothing felt strange yet.

I stepped onto the train like I had a hundred times before. The hum of overhead lights. The quiet shuffle of people. No one smiling. Everyone just… existing. The train moved forward.

I arrived. Same building. I passed through security. Coffee in hand. It was just another day at work, except I wasn’t really sure what kind of work I did. It felt important, or at least organized. Something elite maybe. I believed I was doing good. There was a conference going on—people from all over. Outsiders. I didn’t call them that yet. Back then, I thought we were all the same.

At 9:04 a.m., everything changed.

It wasn’t gradual. It was sudden. Sharp. People stood. Not all of them—just enough.

They pulled out weapons. Not guns. Never guns.

Knives. Axes. Swords. Metal rods. Tools turned brutal.

And they attacked us, the insiders.

It was fast. It was coordinated. No shouting. No speeches. Just pure, explosive rage. Not chaotic—deliberate. It wasn’t war. It was punishment.

The building filled with screams. People tried to run. Others didn’t make it far. I froze. I didn’t fight. I didn’t speak. I was just… gone.

No pain. No noise. Just blankness. White, like everything had been erased.

There were others around—but I didn’t look at them. I couldn’t. I was in shock.

Three stood closest. Figures in white suits—not space suits exactly, but clean, seamless, padded, with silver inside the helmets. Their faces were visible, but the suits seemed protective, not concealing. They were human. Just distant.

One stepped forward and placed something soft over my shoulders. A sweater? A coat? I don’t know. I was tired in that moment—exhausted. Not from running. From being.

And then—

 

Loop 2:

I was back.

Same train platform. Same time. 8:27 a.m.

I almost laughed. That was one heck of a dream.

But then I saw him. The man in the AC/DC shirt—exactly where he stood last time. And the woman in the red tracksuit. She was there too.

And I remembered the guy in the grey button-up. The one who looked at me just a second too long—like he recognized me, like he remembered.

At first, I told myself I was still dreaming.

But then I walked the halls of the building… and started noticing faces. People I didn’t remember before. One of them pulled at his sleeve and I caught it—a circle tattoo, dark and clean, right on the wrist that mimicked a watch.

That’s how they know each other. That’s how they hide amongst us, the insiders.

At 9:04 a.m., it happened again.

Brutal. Timed. Final. I was pulled back again—back in the white space.

This time, one of them speaks.

We’re both standing in the big open white space—tall ceilings, nothing inside, just people. But I don’t look around. I don’t want to see the rest. I can’t.

The man steps forward. Brown hair, mid-forties. Calm, but focused. No expression.

“You only get five,” he says.

“You keep going to work. You follow the same pattern. You’re not asking the right questions.”

Then he adds: “Maybe this isn’t a dream. But if it is… you need to tell the story.”

He puts something on me again. A coat? A suit like his? I don’t know. Just weight.

And then—

 

Loop 3:

This time, I change course.

I don’t go straight to work. I head to the library nearby.

They’re there too. I recognize one of the outsiders—a man in a long black trench coat, pretending to read a newspaper.

I pause.

Does he know I know?

They’re watching.

They’re waiting.

It hits me—the library and the shops around it are holding zones. Staging points. Places to wait near the building until the moment comes.

I leave quickly. I know I should ask questions.

But once again, I choose survival.

I enter through a side door, climb the stairs, and slip into my office. I don’t turn on the lights. I sit in the dark and quietly reflect.

I’m not passionate about my job.

I know I’m good at it—but that’s different.

I’ve turned a blind eye to the bigger picture because I’ve always focused on my own role.

I don’t ask what it all means.

I don’t ask who it affects.

I just do what I’m assigned—and I do it well enough to keep going.

I come for the paycheck.

I stay for the routine.

And I tell myself that’s normal.

I don’t even know exactly what I do. Maybe I work in finance. Or legal. I’m not the one giving the presentation at the conference, but I helped build the slides. I signed things. I contributed.

I played a role.

Why aren’t they protesting?

Why aren’t they shouting?

Why this much rage?

What did we do to cause this?

What did I do?

And why can’t I bring myself to ask them?

Then it happens again.

The screams. The panic.

It’s 9:04.

I hide under my desk and cover my ears.

I feel a presence. I look up.

They’ve found me.

And I’m sent back to the white.

This time, more exhausted than ever.

The same three men approach. I lock eyes with the one who spoke to me before. There’s a trace of hope in his expression.

He says nothing. Just places the weight on my shoulders.

And I return.

 

Loop 4:

I board the train.

I notice a man with a circle tattoo on his wrist.

I ask, “What time is it?”

He answers, “It’s always 9:04.”

A few passengers turn to look at me. Not many. Just the outsiders.

I realize I need to act—but I have so little time.

I won’t stop the attack. But maybe I can survive it.

Then, afterward, I’ll investigate. Learn what this conference is really about. Find out what I’ve been part of all this time.

I wear long sleeves to cover my wrists. No marks. No signs.

I enter the building and see a colleague. He’s walking with an outsider. They’re laughing.

As I pass them, I look the outsider in the eyes. He smiles. But his eyes are cold.

I move past my office and slip into the supply room. I wedge a chair under the handle—not to block them, just to slow them.

I wait. I cover my ears. I count my breath.

At 10:00, I emerge.

The boardroom—where the conference was supposed to be—is filled with bodies.

Among them, I spot a young girl crouched beneath a table. She’s frozen, barely breathing. A file clerk, maybe.

I crouch beside her. “You’re going to play dead,” I whisper. “Don’t move. No matter what.”

She nods. But she’s trembling.

We lie down. We wait.

We might have survived.

But she panics. Makes a sound.

They find us.

One of them—a tall woman—looks at me. Not with hate. With disappointment.

Then the blade comes.

 

I wake up.

But not in the white space. Not on the train.

Just… here.

Back in my life.

I don’t think I’ll be sent back again.

I think I failed the mission.

Maybe I wasn’t sent back because I got too close to dying. Or maybe I was never supposed to stop it—just understand it.

But I didn’t ask questions.

I watched. I ran. I survived.

And even in the loop, I did what I always did: my job.

I don’t know what it meant.

I just know I played a part—whatever fueled the outsiders, I helped it.

I failed the mission because I chose survival.

I didn’t ask the questions.

They didn’t even send me back for loop five—my final chance.

Maybe they chose someone else.

Maybe that person will tell their story.

My final task was simple:

I was told to write about it.

So I did.

*Meeting structure:*

* 30 minutes open discussion. We go around and share what books we’re reading this week. 
* 60 minutes of Silent Reading 
* 30 minutes of additional discussion (totally optional, most folks just leave at the end of the hour) & goodbyes

We meet in The Redmond Hotel lobby. You can head to the Wayfarer bar, coffee shop area, or spread out around the fireplace during our Silent Reading Time.

I’d like to fit in as most seating as possible without cluttering the space, a coffee table and some type of tv stand. 

The tv has to go on the side labeled tv due to wiring and can’t be drilled into the wall. I would love some opinions on where you would place everything, would you do a small L couch or a 2/3 seater with an arm chair., ideally I’d like to do darker colors (going for a moody vibe) but would that make the room appear even smaller?, etc.  

I’ll take any and all ideas and help:)

The orange and pink hues slowly creep over distant peaks. A thick gray fog clings low to the ground. It’s a typical summer morning in Western North Carolina. Everything is slightly damp from the evening rain; the air outside feels like a big hug.

I play my newest favorite song as I gain momentum on the freeway.  
*“Take me back to school yard days, Rosie ring ring.”*  
My fingers gently tap the steering wheel. Nostalgia overwhelms me. I wish morning dew and quiet skies could last all day. 

The parking garage is still mostly empty at 5:45. I park up front, even though I know I should go further back to work toward that ten-thousand-step goal I set for myself. I take a few deep breaths before getting out.

**Beeeeep.** I badge through the cold metal doors. “STAFF ENTRANCE ONLY”  
My shoes peel off the floor with a **schriiipppp**.  
It smells like freshly waxed machinery. I pass the doctor’s lounge and get the slightest whiff of bacon.  
Exhausted faces pass me—furrowed brows, wrinkled scrubs, to-go coffee cups. 

I take the stairs. Two flights, rather than the elevator. Maybe getting my heart rate up will give me the kind of morning energy that coffee isn’t quite delivering yet.

Tiny, erratic speckles of brown and gray dot the tiled floor. It always looks a little dirty and worn, even right after housekeeping comes by. Glaring fluorescent lights, filled with the corpses of tiny bugs, drown out any sunrise glow that filters through our two windows—which offer scenic views of nearby cement walls.

I pick up the list: thirty-five patients on service today. A streak of toner runs down the left side of the page.  
Why can’t maintenance just give us a new printer instead of constantly trying to fix this one?

Molly comes into the work room as I am deciding which patient to see first. She has been up all night managing the critical-care unit. 

“How was your night?” I ask, hoping it was easy-going and she was able to rest/

“Not bad, but the patient is 386 may not make it,” she said.

- Chef running a small kitchen in a local bar with a great team. Mostly scratch, seasonal and local fare. Passionate about food and plan to own a restaurant someday. I don't have tattoos but my cooks well than make up for it.
- Everyday coffee, sometimes tea with boba and social drinking only. Never tried any substances beyond those nor have strong desires to. I do go out with friends or coworkers but I'd much prefer to stay home, get cozy with someone I could cuddle with.
-  I lean left and haven't gone to church in while despite being raised in a religious household. 
- I have a great relationship with my parents and siblings. I still talk regularly with friends I've known since gradeschool and highschool.

For context, I just finished my graduate program. Seeing my peers land jobs with great pay and benefits right after graduation — some returning to their old internships, others getting lucky through mass applying — makes me wonder what I did wrong.

I started looking since last September. I’m so tired of sending out applications and hearing nothing. My email inbox feels dead silent. People keep telling me to network, but I’m exhausted from that too. I’ve done coffee chats, followed up when people said “Let me know if you see a role at my company” — and yet, when I actually reach out, it goes nowhere.

Even though I’ve consistently received great feedback from supervisors and colleagues in my paster internships/part-time roles, I feel like I’m just being used temporarily and thrown away when I’m no longer needed. It’s like I’m disposable.

All I want is a stable job that gets me one step closer to the dream I’ve been chasing so hard. I’m 25 and still financially dependent on my parents. They’re Asian parents — generous in giving me almost everything I need — but I want so badly to be financially independent, so I can feel like I have more power in the relationship.

1lgzbpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1lgzbpx/el_cid_riviera_maya_review/,El Cid Riviera Maya Review,"I would describe El Cid Riviera Maya as one resort with three themes: Marina, Ventus and Ventus Ha. Each of the three sections has approximately 7 5-story buildings for a total of 21 lodging buildings. Marina and Ventus are attached and really only discernable by a change in building color, Ventus Ha is a newer area that is situated a short walk across the street in the jungle (no direct beach access).

**Overall:  6/10**

We enjoyed our trip to El Cid in Puerto Morelos, but don’t expect we will return. The room and grounds were very nice, the staff was mostly great, the food was ok, the beach was pretty bad and the time-share push early was off-putting. I think this could be a good value option for the right folks and believe that kids are free or discounted based on other reviews I have read. Wifi is not included, they charge by device and the cellular data was pretty spotty. 5 nights for a total of (excluding spa, excursions, tips and travel) $2010: $1500 initial booking, $250 room upgrade, $200 taxes/resort fee, $60 one device wifi.

**Room and Resort: 8/10**

There are 3 different lobbies, about 8 different dining options, a coffee and sweets shop, about 8 different pool/jacuzzi areas. The resort was all very well-manicured and maintained. Our room was a “Platinum” level king room on the top floor with an ocean view. It had a large shower, two sinks, love seat and a balcony with a couple chairs. We were pleasantly surprised by the resort and room quality.

**Pools and Beach: 4/10**

The pools were plentiful and pretty nice. There was a large main pool at both Marina and Ventus, one with a rock slide and jumping platform for the kids. 2 infinity pools overlooking the beach/ocean, one of which is adults only. Ventus Ha has 2 main pools and 2 roof top adults only bar/pools (one of which was closed during our visit). The rooftop was a fun experience.

The beach is a 1/10 by itself, they have obviously had erosion issues so the sand area is very small and the swimming area has large sandbags set up as wavebreaks to help prevent continued issues. The sargassum was real bad during our trip, but not much the resort can do about that. I didn’t see anyone in the water during our visit. Don’t come here for the beach.

**Food: 6/10**

Breakfast was basically the same buffet with omelet station at each of the 5 options. Some minor differences.

Lunch is cafeteria style at restaurant with about 8-10 food options. This was better than I expected for a quick service setup and thought it was quite good.

Dinner we ate at the Hibachi, Ibero-American, Seafood, Mexican, and French restaurants. Those are our order of preference with the Hibachi really being a fun experience and well executed. We had a mix of good and meh dishes at the other restaurants and felt the French restaurant really fell flat.

**Booking/Check-in/Communication: 3/10**

We had a lot of inconsistent and inaccurate communications with El Cid prior to and during our initial check in. This made it difficult to plan and get in the right mind-set for our trip. They do an initial time-share push to get you to attend a meeting during check-in, that was off-putting, but could result in \~$400 in discounts if you wanted to sit through the 90-minute presentation. Communication and check-in was the worst part of our experience.

She took it upon herself to embellish what I said telling the manager I said comments about her... lets just say odor which I would never be clever enough to make but whatever.

You got to try coffee, talk to people, laugh, and get paid to do it. Like it was fun. I even made shift supervisor less than four months into working.

Anyways, Ive been applying recently at starbucks because Id love a second job and id love to work here I applied a couple places and received the thank you for replying.

After 4 months of consulting 5 different physicians (including Gastro), 3 endoscopies and multiple tests, they arrived at the diagnosis of Crohn's with stricture at the junction of duodenum & jejunum. After the diagnosis, I found that I had became intolerant to rice and potatoes. My mom and grandmom understood the disease after I explained it to them, but my dad's opinion was that this was not a disease and ""It's all becoz u ate lot of lemons, 3 years ago"".   
After completing the meds and avoiding the specific trigger foods (rice, potatoes), I went into remission.

Around 2 weeks back, I had a flare-up which kept on increasing in severity everyday. Me and my mom saw my dad was adding something like powder to the milk before I drank it. There was no taste or odor change in the milk thou. We had suspicions that he was also adding something to the salt and sugar in kitchen.   
So I stayed in my Granny's place for a few days. During the stay I had no symptoms, not even pain or bloating. Meanwhile my mom threw away everything that was suspicious and bought everything new. I returned back to my home, we are being very careful in locking everything in kitchen and ensuring only we have access to them. After doing all this I feel better and we have seen my dad trying to pry open the things we locked.

There are 2 other things that bothered me during this time which may or may not be related.

1. Just 2 days before my flare-up, I informed that I got selected for Masters in Europe and my dad and elder brother hated that and were against it. When I said I will be going there, he replied ""Something unexpected may happen and your plan may fail""
2. Before this recent Flare-up, there was a incident when like this time my dad was doing something in kitchen (My dad never uses the kitchen). I took a sip of the milk later and there was a strong taste of rust. So I threw it out entirely & didn't think much of it.

I asked about this issue in r/CrohnsDisease around 10 days prior & intended to publish this story here too but couldn't. Here are the events that happened after that.

1. I forgot to lock a jar of cookies inside the cabinet, ate them the next day & got sick again.
2. My mom's coffee has tasted weird multiple times and she also got sick after drinking it too.
3. My Dad broke into the locked kitchen cabinet and the refrigerator.
4. We replaced all the things there and shifted them to my granny's Home.
5. Me & my mom are travelling to my granny's home for every meal.
6. We also have suspicions that my brother knows about this and chose to ignore as he visited home and avoids eating anything at home.

We are taking careful steps to confirm these. (I don’t want to get into too much detail, but we are trying to get solid evidence before doing anything further.)  
Let me know if I’m overthinking, or what steps I should take next. I feel very unsafe and emotionally drained, but I just want to make sure I’m not losing perspective.",18,1750519707.0,relationship_advice,22,0.91,False

I’m a 28-year-old male-shaped entity hailing from that vibrant patch of Europe where people argue for sport, drink coffee like it’s a competitive event, and can hold a grudge longer than most international treaties.

By profession, I’m a.. let's say a programmer. I mostly just argue with machines until something works (or explode.. either is progress). I can’t hack into anything important, but I can make your app crash if that's what you want.

Outside of work, I’m a hobby hoarder. I dabble in:

Hoarding books I will definitely read after one day.

Gaming like I’m trying to speedrun social isolation. (recently started playing nightrein - if you play it too on steam pls carry me lol)

Random artistic rabbit holes

Cooking experiments that mostly end in fire alarms and philosophical reflection.

Pretending I work out (I don’t... at least not effectively) and rewarding myself for standing up with snacks.

I speak several languages, which mostly means I mispronounce things internationally now. I also believe sleep is an optional DLC pack and time is a government conspiracy.

What am I looking for?

Someone chill and human-adjacent

People who enjoy voice chats and send cursed memes

Dark humor survivors - someone who can match or appreciate dark, borderline concerning humor

Individuals fluent in sarcasm, chaos, and the art of sending TikToks instead of forming real emotional connections

Someone who hasn't slept properly since 2019

Bonus if you’ve ever cried over a movie, a dog video, or a badly timed game save. I know i didn't.

You don’t need to be perfect, just weird in a compatible way.

So if you're bored, curious, or just vibing, slide into my DMs. Worst-case scenario: we exchange weird memes and vanish into the night like digital cryptids. Best-case scenario: we become chaotic internet friends with questionable sleep schedules.

By profession, I’m a.. let's say a programmer. I mostly just argue with machines until something works (or explode.. either is progress). I can’t hack into anything important, but I can make your app crash if that's what you want.

Outside of work, I’m a hobby hoarder. I dabble in:

Hoarding books I will definitely read after one day.

Gaming like I’m trying to speedrun social isolation. (recently started playing nightrein - if you play it too on steam pls carry me lol)

Random artistic rabbit holes

Cooking experiments that mostly end in fire alarms and philosophical reflection.

Pretending I work out (I don’t... at least not effectively) and rewarding myself for standing up with snacks.

I speak several languages, which mostly means I mispronounce things internationally now. I also believe sleep is an optional DLC pack and time is a government conspiracy.

What am I looking for?

Someone chill and human-adjacent

People who enjoy voice chats and send cursed memes

Dark humor survivors - someone who can match or appreciate dark, borderline concerning humor

Individuals fluent in sarcasm, chaos, and the art of sending TikToks instead of forming real emotional connections

Someone who hasn't slept properly since 2019

Bonus if you’ve ever cried over a movie, a dog video, or a badly timed game save. I know i didn't.

You don’t need to be perfect, just weird in a compatible way.

So if you're bored, curious, or just vibing, slide into my DMs. Worst-case scenario: we exchange weird memes and vanish into the night like digital cryptids. Best-case scenario: we become chaotic internet friends with questionable sleep schedules.

We’ve tried planting grass three times but it just won’t survive — either it gets too much sun or not enough. The sun starts on the left side of the yard in the morning, moves overhead, and then sets on the right, so it’s pretty exposed throughout the day.

I’d love to turn this space into a cozy, low-budget area where I can enjoy my coffee, read, or write. I’m open to DIY ideas, shade solutions, or even low-maintenance ground cover options. I’d really appreciate any suggestions to make it feel inviting without spending too much.

(Planning on spending 2 days in the city proper and 1 day self-driving the golden circle).  Considering attempting touring Snaefellsnes but do need to be back in Reykjavik that night.  

1. Can/should this be done without accessing F roads? (This drives our rental car selection).  We would like to get as close to the glacier as possible.  

2.  Realistically how many hours do we need to devote?  We do tend to want to wander a bit and absorb the locations, not just rush from spot to spot?  Are we crazy for even trying this in a day?

3. Is there a recommended list of priority stops, particularly those with things that can't be seen elsewhere? (We will be in Akureyri earlier in the week).  Is a truncated route possible/worth it or should we do the full drive if we're committing a day? 

4. We're assuming we need to carry our own provisions for maximum flexibility, but is there any recommended stop for food and coffee/tea?

1lgz0i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1lgz0i0/kendu_why_irl_efforts_are_the_future/,Kendu - Why IRL Efforts Are The Future,"Kendu is a memecoin over a year old, with around 18.5k holders, we have a massive emphasis on community building and IRL efforts. Kendu has transitioned into a brandcoin, whether we are the first brand coin or not, it doesn't really matter imo since Kendu is currently doing it on an unmatched and unprecedented scale. A major point to note is this is all being done below 30 million market cap when the average holder is in very little profit or even the red. When Kendu moves into the hundreds of millions or even the billions, the average community member will have a lot of money to invest into their creative ideas, so although we already have an enormous collection of IRL alpha, it is only gonna get bigger and it will get bigger fast.

If we are being real with ourselves, crypto kinda has a bad name, if you ask your non crypto mate to invest in a coin chances are they will be opposed to it, due to celebrity and even presidential antics. However, this is where Kendu steps in, we have great distribution, we are completely decentralised(there is no team), we have so many IRL initiatives that show **proof of humanity.** In a world that is currently being changed due to AI, **proof of humanity**, is one of the last differentiators between AI and humans. IRL products give a project a lot of trust, since it can't be faked, retail are gonna love this and we have all seen the crazy spikes when retail enters the market. Due to the reasons stated above, I truly believe Kendu will be the coin that benefits the most when the retail tsunami arrives.

Here is a list of our IRL initiatives:

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping
* Kendu Press

In a world where AI is dominating, Kendu is the best and most complete **proof of humanity**, IRL products cannot be faked, but social media likes can be. You can add to this list, just get involved and release your product under the Kendu umbrella, whether you have been here since day 1 or 1 day you will receive the Kendu army's  maximum support.

**My Advice**

I would buy at least a small bag of Kendu, at these price levels and the fact that the market has been stagnant for a while, there is no way that you will lose money(of course this is NFA). But I truly believe there is no downside risk at these levels and at below 30 million market cap, the upside potential is simply mind-blowing.

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, “I would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!”

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It’s simply unbelievable!”

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, “I would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!”

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It’s simply unbelievable!”

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

Ever feel like you’re shouting into the void when trying to grow your brand online? Like, *hello*, where's the engagement? 🤔 Honestly, it can get frustrating, especially when we’re all juggling so many things. But what if I told you that you don’t *have* to show your face to see real success? Yep, you heard that right!

**Ditch the Face, Grab the Cash: Faceless Growth Strategies *Actually* Working NOW 🤑**

Let’s break it down. You can totally thrive online *without* putting your face out there. Here are some killer strategies that are doing wonders RIGHT NOW:

- **Leverage AI Content Creation:** 
  - ChatGPT (hey, that’s us!) can help you create killer content without breaking a sweat. I mean, didn’t we all sign up to work smart, not hard? Use AI to generate blog posts, social media content, or even newsletters. You’ll save time and lots of sanity! 

- **Curated Content:** 
  - Not feeling the creative juices flowing? No problem! Curate content from others in your niche. Think of it as putting together a mixtape of the best finds—everyone loves a good playlist. Plus, it establishes you as a go-to resource in your field.

- **Automated Marketing Funnels:**
  - Set up a marketing funnel that does the heavy lifting for you. Think of it as creating a behind-the-scenes automated robot that draws in leads while you kick back with a coffee. Who doesn't want that?

- **Affiliate and Passive Income:**
  - Here’s the kicker—jumping into affiliate marketing can seriously boost your income without much face time. Check out resources like [this helpful guide](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) to get started. It’s like your money working for you while you’re busy Netflix binging. Win-win!

So, what’s the deal with faceless strategies? Why do they rock? 

- **Less Pressure:** No need to worry about perfect lighting, your hair being a hot mess, or having “the look” that everyone’s after.
- **Focus on Real Value:** It's more about the content and less about the persona. People appreciate *authentic* insights, not just a pretty face.
- **Scaling Up Is Easier:** You can create systems (hello, automation) that allow you to grow and scale without constantly being in the spotlight.

Now, let’s be real for a second. It’s super tempting to think that showing your face is the *only* way to build a following. But you don’t need to conform to what the mainstream might tell you! There are countless successful accounts out there that never show their faces, and they’re thriving. 

So, what are your thoughts? Have you tried any faceless strategies? What worked (or didn’t work) for you? Let’s share our wins and learnings, and support each other in this wild ride of content creation!

Traveling from Michigan to Japan is now simplified with nonstop flights from Detroit to Tokyo's Haneda Airport, offering faster access. The guide covers essential travel tips, lodging options, local cuisine, and navigating Tokyo’s transit for a smooth experience. \
Traveling from Michigan to Japan has never been easier. With nonstop flights now connecting Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) to Tokyo's Haneda Airport (HND), planning a trip to Japan is far more convenient than in years past. This direct route cuts down on travel time, eliminates long layovers, and allows for a smoother arrival into Tokyo’s city center.\
\
For Michigan travelers—whether heading to Japan for business, leisure, or family visits—Haneda’s close proximity to downtown Tokyo is a major advantage over Narita Airport, which sits much farther outside the city. This post offers a practical guide to navigating your flight, choosing where to stay, finding iconic local dishes, and staying connected once you land.\

Flight Information: Detroit to Tokyo Haneda\
\
DTW McNamara Terminal - Courtesy Wayne County Airport Authority\
\
Delta Air Lines operates a regular nonstop service between Detroit to Tokyo Haneda. The flight typically takes around 13 hours eastbound and slightly longer returning west due to prevailing winds. Flights generally depart from the McNamara Terminal and land at Haneda’s international terminal, offering an easy transition to Tokyo’s local rail and subway systems.\
\
Flight Information at DTW - Courtesy Delta\
\
This nonstop route is part of Delta’s transpacific network and is one of the few direct gateways from the Midwest to Japan. Booking early—at least three to four months in advance—is recommended for the best fares. Peak travel seasons, such as cherry blossom season (late March to early April) and the autumn foliage period (October to November), tend to fill quickly.\
\
Booking Tips:\
\
Look for fare deals in late January, February, and early September.\
\
Consider premium economy for the long-haul comfort without the business class price.\
\
Enroll in SkyMiles to earn rewards and qualify for upgrades.\
\
\
Travelers who value time and access will benefit from flying into Haneda rather than Narita. Haneda is only about 30 minutes from central Tokyo by train or taxi, compared to up to 90 minutes from Narita. For those planning to jump into sightseeing or meetings shortly after landing, this time savings is substantial.\
\
Where to Stay in Tokyo\
\
Shinjuku\
\
Tokyo offers a wide range of lodging options that fit any budget or travel style. First-time visitors often benefit from staying near major train lines for easy access to attractions across the city.\
\
Best Districts for Visitors:\
\
Shinjuku: A central transportation hub with high-rise hotels, shopping, and vibrant nightlife. It’s ideal for first-timers who want convenience and energy.\
\
Shibuya: Popular among younger travelers, Shibuya offers stylish hotels near the famous scramble crossing, youth fashion districts, and late-night dining.\
\
Asakusa: For travelers interested in traditional Japan, Asakusa offers a quieter, more historic experience near the iconic Sensoji Temple.\
\
Ginza: Known for luxury shopping and upscale accommodations, Ginza is a polished and quiet base for those seeking comfort and proximity to Tokyo Station.\
\
\
Recommended Hotels:\
\
Budget:APA Hotel Shinjuku Gyoen-mae – Clean, compact rooms and excellent locations under $100/night.\
\
Tokyu Stay Shibuya – Extended-stay comfort with in-room washers and small kitchenettes.\
\
\
\
Mid-range:Hotel Gracery Shinjuku – Known for its “Godzilla Room” and excellent access to transit.\
\
Mitsui Garden Hotel Ginza Premier – Great skyline views with polished amenities.\
\
\
\

\
Conrad Tokyo – Overlooking Tokyo Bay, with world-class dining and spa services.\
\
\
\
\
Most hotels include Wi-Fi, but not all provide easy mobile connectivity off-site. That’s why choosing lodging near a major train line or station is crucial—it saves time and hassle when getting around.\
\
\
\
Must-Try Regional Dishes in Tokyo and Beyond\
\
Nigiri sushi\
\
Japan’s food culture is one of the biggest draws for international visitors, and Tokyo is the heart of it. From street stalls to Michelin-starred counters, the capital delivers an unmatched culinary experience. Depending on your ticket class, the Detroit to Tokyo Haneda flight my include an opportunity to same Japanese cuisine. \
\
Tokyo Specialties:\
\
Edomae Sushi: Traditional Tokyo-style sushi that originated in the Edo period. Try it at mid-range chains like Sushi Zanmai or splurge at Sukiyabashi Jiro (reservations required).\
\
Tsukemen: A thicker noodle served separately from a concentrated dipping broth. Menya Musashi and Rokurinsha are popular options.\
\
Monjayaki: A runnier version of okonomiyaki cooked tableside on a griddle, common in the Tsukishima district.\
\
\
Regional Dishes Worth Seeking Out:\
\
Yokohama (30 minutes south):Chinatown offers Nikuman (steamed meat buns), gyoza, and unique Japanese-Chinese fusion dishes.\
\
\
\
Hakone (90 minutes west):Sample kuro tamago (black eggs boiled in volcanic hot springs). Legend says eating one adds seven years to your life.\
\
\
\
Osaka (via Shinkansen bullet train):Known for takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (savory pancakes). A food-lover’s paradise with a casual, friendly vibe.\
\
\
\
\
Tokyo’s dining options range from ¥1,000 ramen joints to ¥30,000 omakase dinners. Plan to mix street food experiences with sit-down meals to fully appreciate the diversity of Japanese cuisine.\
\
Getting Around: Transit Basics\
\
Tokyo Metro\
\
Tokyo’s public transit system is one of the most efficient in the world, but it can be confusing for first-time visitors. Understanding how to move through the city can save both time and stress.\
\
IC Cards: Suica and Pasmo\
\
Suica and Pasmo are rechargeable smart cards used on trains, buses, and even vending machines.\
\
Available at airport kiosks, JR stations, and convenience stores.\
\
Tap to enter and exit the transit gates—no need to buy single tickets.\
\
Cards are interchangeable across most major cities in Japan, including Kyoto, Osaka, and Yokohama.\
\
\
Tokyo Metro vs. JR Lines\
\
Tokyo Metro is a subway network that serves central neighborhoods.\
\
JR Lines like the Yamanote Line loop around the city and are included if you have a Japan Rail Pass.\
\
When in doubt, Google Maps and the “Japan Travel by Navitime” app both show real-time routes and fare prices.\
\
\
Should You Get a Japan Rail Pass?\
\
For trips limited to Tokyo and surrounding areas, a JR Pass may not be worth the cost.\
\
If you plan to visit Kyoto, Hiroshima, or Sapporo within seven to 14 days, it can save significant money.\
\
Passes must be purchased before arriving in Japan and can be activated at Haneda’s JR East Travel Service Center.\
\
\
A tip for new travelers: trains are rarely late, and people queue politely. Have your IC card ready, and avoid phone calls or loud conversations while riding.\
\
\
\
Staying Connected: Internet, SIM Cards & Wi-Fi\
\
\
\
Internet access is essential for navigating Tokyo, translating menus, and communicating with home. Japan offers multiple options depending on how long you’ll stay and how many devices you need to connect.\
\
SIM Card Options at Haneda\
\
Visitors can purchase prepaid SIM cards right at Haneda Airport after clearing customs.\
\
Options include SoftBank, NTT Docomo, and IIJmio. Look for kiosks or vending machines near arrival areas.\
\
Standard packages:7-day SIM with 3–5GB data: around ¥2,500–¥3,000\
\
14-day unlimited data SIM: around ¥4,000–¥5,500\
\
\
\
Bring an unlocked phone that supports Japanese frequency bands.\
\
\
eSIM for Compatible Phones\
\
eSIM options like Airalo or Ubigi allow digital setup before you even land.\
\
Best for iPhones (XS or later) and Google Pixel 4 or newer.\
\
Activation typically takes minutes with no physical SIM swapping needed.\
\
\
Pocket Wi-Fi Rentals\
\
Pocket Wi-Fi devices offer unlimited data and can connect multiple devices at once.\
\
Rental companies like Ninja WiFi or Japan Wireless offer airport pickup and return.\
\
Good option for families or groups, but requires charging and returning the unit before departure.\
\
\
Free Wi-Fi Access Points\
\
Found at most 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, and Lawson convenience stores.\
\
Starbucks, McDonald’s, and many train stations also offer free Wi-Fi.\
\
Consider downloading the “Japan Wi-Fi Auto-Connect” app to automatically join supported networks.\

Cultural Tips for First-Time Visitors\
\
Konbini\
\
Japan is orderly, clean, and highly respectful—but also operates with customs that may be unfamiliar to American travelers. Knowing a few basics will go a long way.\
\
Social Etiquette\
\
Shoes off indoors: Be prepared to remove your shoes when entering homes, temples, and some restaurants.\
\
Politeness matters: Bowing is a common greeting. Avoid loud conversations in public, especially on transit.\
\
Cash culture: Many small businesses still don’t accept credit cards. Carry cash—ATMs in 7-Eleven are foreign card-friendly.\
\
\
Konbini (Convenience Stores)\
\
7-Eleven, FamilyMart, and Lawson are everywhere and offer freshly made meals, drinks, ATMs, and daily essentials.\
\
Hot coffee, prepackaged sushi, and onigiri (rice balls) are reliable, inexpensive meals on the go.\
\
\
Tipping\
\
Tipping is not customary in Japan and can even be considered rude. Exceptional service is already included in the price.\

My wife and I collect a crap ton of stickers and had been using a scrapbook to store them all.

There are a few sticker journals out there that are cool, but they didn’t really feel like something you’d want to leave out as a display item.

She sells stickers, bumper stickers, and pins on her Etsy and Shopify, so she posted the idea to some of her customers and got a lot of feedback on Instagram and TikTok. She’s been building this prototype for a few months now and is super proud of it. I wanted to get y’all’s thoughts too, because I feel like Reddit (for better or worse lol) is actually a better platform for talking through ideas and projects.

I probably should’ve posted this earlier, but she just launched it on Kickstarter for pre-orders with 11 different color options. Still totally open to feedback, and I’d love to hear what y’all think!

Finding Faith in Stars Hollow: Biblical Lessons from Gilmore Girls
==================================================================

Imagine small-town life with its quirky characters, charming coffee shops, and the hustle and bustle of town meetings. Welcome to Stars Hollow, the whimsical setting of “Gilmore Girls.” This beloved TV show, filled with humor and heart, offers rich narratives and character dynamics that beautifully echo timeless biblical principles. Let’s explore how the lives of Lorelai, Rory, and their friends can illuminate our understanding of faith, family, and integrity.

The Power of Family Bonds
-------------------------

Lorelai and Rory Gilmore’s relationship is the heartbeat of “Gilmore Girls.” Their close-knit bond underscores a biblical theme found in Proverbs 22:6: “Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old, he will not depart from it.”

- **Parental Wisdom**: Lorelai, despite unconventional methods, provides guidance and support to Rory. Her dedication reflects the biblical call to nurture and instruct children in faith and values.
- **Resilience in Relationships**: Just as Lorelai and Rory face trials, families in the Bible, like that of Jacob and Joseph, navigate complex dynamics with love and forgiveness at the core.

Reflect: How can you strengthen your family bonds to reflect biblical teaching? What steps can you take to nurture those relationships?

The Wisdom of Community
-----------------------

Stars Hollow thrives on community interaction, mirroring the early church in Acts 2:42-47, where believers shared life and resources.

- **Unity in Diversity**: Despite eccentricities, the townspeople come together to support each other, much like the unity called for among believers (Philippians 2:2).
- **Service and Support**: Characters like Sookie and Luke often step in to help others, reflecting the biblical exhortation to serve one another in love (Galatians 5:13).

Reflect: What role do you play in your community? How can you better serve those around you?

Chasing Dreams and Perseverance
-------------------------------

Rory’s academic ambitions and Lorelai’s entrepreneurial spirit are testaments to perseverance. Colossians 3:23 reminds us, “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord.”

- **Hard Work Pays Off**: The Gilmores demonstrate diligence and dedication, much like Paul, who encourages believers to strive for their goals with perseverance.
- **Embracing Failure**: Both characters face setbacks, yet they rise again, embodying the biblical principle that resilience leads to growth (James 1:2-4).

Reflect: What are your goals, and how can you pursue them with perseverance and faith? What lessons have past failures taught you?

Forgiveness and Grace
---------------------

The show is rife with misunderstandings and reconciliations, similar to biblical narratives like Esau forgiving Jacob after years of estrangement.

- **Healing through Forgiveness**: Luke and Lorelai’s tumultuous relationship eventually finds grace, illustrating Ephesians 4:32: “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.”
- **Redemption and Renewal**: Characters often seek redemption in their relationships, mirroring the ultimate forgiveness offered through Christ.

Reflect: Is there someone you need to forgive? How can embracing grace restore your relationships?

The Gift of Friendship
----------------------

Friendship is a cornerstone of the series, highlighting qualities found in Ecclesiastes 4:9-10, which speaks about the strength found in unity.

- **Loyal Companions**: The camaraderie between Rory, Lane, and others showcases steadfast friendship, much like David and Jonathan’s bond (1 Samuel 18:1-4).
- **Supporting Each Other**: Through life’s ups and downs, friends uplift each other, illustrating Proverbs 17:17: “A friend loves at all times.”

Reflect: How do you support your friends, and how do they support you? What can you do to be a better friend?

Conclusion: Embracing the Journey
---------------------------------

Whether navigating family ties, pursuing goals, or cherishing friendships, “Gilmore Girls” reflects myriad biblical principles that encourage us to live with love, humility, and grace. As you reflect on these themes, consider how you can incorporate them into your daily life.

I recently got the Prada cups, and I’m honestly impressed. The design is super elegant and minimalistic – just what you’d expect from a luxury brand like Prada. They look and feel high-end, with a smooth finish and solid build quality.

The logo is clean and well-placed, not too flashy but still makes a statement. These cups are perfect for anyone who likes stylish kitchenware or wants to add a touch of luxury to their daily coffee or tea routine.

Overall, I’d say they’re worth it if you’re into designer pieces and quality. Definitely not your average cup – it’s Prada.

1lgyqr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1lgyqr8/dreading_upcoming_vacation/,Dreading upcoming vacation!,"Long time lurker here, and I feel the urge to post about my building sense of dread covering our upcoming vacation.  For context I (41 HLM) have been married to my wife (42 LLF) for 13 years, and we have a 10 year old son.  For pretty much 10 of our 13 years of marriage we have had a dead bedroom, with only occasional flashes of intensity, and when I said dead bedroom I mean that we will sometimes go 6+ months without any intimacy.  Many times though when my wife and I have been able to have some alone time or get away from our son for a few days our intimacy becomes amazing.

Anyways, since we are stationed overseas we haven't had a lot of “us time” for the past two years since we are all each other has. Well next week we are headed for over 10 days to Sweden so our son can attend a sports camp.  This will be awesome as it should give my wife and I five days and nights of just us time, with no kid to interrupt or demand all attention.  I have maintained a “healthily skeptical optimism” about the trip in that I am not expecting that suddenly my wife is going to be walking around naked all the time or in lingerie and jumping at crazy sex 4-5 times a day.  But more optimism that maybe this will be a chance for us to get a spark and have some fun for 5 days without the added family stress.  

Anyways, in the past week I have started to see the signs of how my wife is speaking that I always see when a trip or chance like this comes up that just immediately sends me back inside on myself because it usually means that this will end like many others, just a dead bedroom in a new place.  Even though we picked out the hotel together she's now saying.  “Its so small, there's no bathtub, just a stand up shower, there's no room to put our clothes.”  Shes also saying.  “I dont want to just walk around, eat, drink and go see sights, and thats what all there seems to be there.”  

When asked what she wants to do I hear, “go to the beach, hike, adventure, do something we cant do other places.”  In addition she has been complaining of back pain, so I found a sauna/spa place where you go fully nude and can sit in hot tubs and saunas as well as get a massage and jump into the cold ocean.  At first she was excited, but recently has been saying things about how shes not sure she wants to go in the water because of sharks, or shes worried she wont look good enough around younger women.  I was like WTF!

Finally shes obsessing about our dog and how shes worried that it will be alone a lot and neglected, but also how we cant take it out with us too much.  Basically to me it looks like shes looking for excuses.  Meanwhile I keep talking positive things and how exciting it will be.  I mention how exciting it will be, and how we can sit on a balcony every morning drinking coffee, go do things we want to do, and be romantic and adventurous all without our kid bothering us, as he will be having a great time at camp.

Should I be feeling this sense of dread?  What advice do you all have on how I can look at the sunshine through the storm clouds?  Also, what should I do to maybe try and make sure there is a spark for us?

Packed with antioxidants and nutrients, it offers a treasure trove of benefits that have made it a daily ritual for millions around the world. Let’s explore the positive impact of green tea on our health and why it deserves a spot in your cup.

**1. A Natural Energy Booster (Without the Crash)**  
Green tea provides a gentle caffeine kick—just enough to keep you alert without the jitters or crashes associated with coffee. It combines caffeine with L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes calm and focus. This perfect balance supports productivity and mental clarity throughout the day.

**2. Rich in Antioxidants**  
The real power of green tea lies in its abundance of polyphenols, especially catechins like EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate). These natural antioxidants combat free radicals in the body, helping to reduce inflammation and slow down aging at the cellular level.

**3. Supports Heart Health**  
Regular consumption of green tea is linked to improved heart function. It helps lower LDL (bad cholesterol) while raising HDL (good cholesterol), improving overall cholesterol ratios. Some studies have shown that it can help reduce blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular diseases over time.

**4. Boosts Metabolism and Aids in Weight Management**  
Green tea can enhance metabolic rate and increase fat oxidation, making it a supportive tool for weight management. While not a magic solution, drinking green tea alongside a balanced diet and regular exercise may promote more effective fat burning and help maintain a healthy weight.

**5. Enhances Brain Function**  
Thanks to its unique mix of caffeine and L-theanine, green tea improves brain performance by enhancing memory, cognitive function, and mood. It’s often praised for creating a “calm alertness” that helps people think clearly without feeling overstimulated.

**6. Supports Immune Health**  
Green tea contains antiviral and antibacterial properties, which can strengthen the immune system. Its powerful antioxidants help the body fend off infections and reduce the severity and duration of colds or flu.

**7. Promotes Longevity**  
With its wide range of health benefits, from heart and brain health to cancer-fighting properties, green tea is often associated with increased lifespan. Populations with high green tea consumption tend to enjoy better overall health well into old age.

Green tea isn’t just a trend—it’s a lifestyle choice rooted in centuries of tradition and backed by modern science. A simple cup a day might just be the healthiest habit you can start.",1,1750518499.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

We're moving in late August and planning to rent a furnished place for 4 to 6 months so we can get to know the city before putting down roots. Still trying to find options there, so LMK if you know of any good spots.

More than anything, I'm hoping to find a sense of community. I'm sociable, but everywhere l've lived before l've had (or developed) strong professional and social networks to lean on, even when my life as a med spouse meant I didn't have a ton of time with my husband. That made it much easier to be independent but not lonely. And it was a lot easier in my 20s!

I'm into book clubs, long walks, tennis, indie films, pop culture, writing, and discussing current events over coffee or a good cocktail. I also care a lot about civic life and would love to volunteer or help with local nonprofit events. I've lived in London, DC, and New York and have learned that it's easy to stay busy, but harder to feel connected. I'd like this chapter to be different.

Ah, France! The very name conjures images of rolling vineyards, iconic Eiffel Tower vistas, and the irresistible aroma of freshly baked croissants. But let's be honest, for many of us, the siren song of the French coastline is just as potent, if not more so. Forget the bustling cityscapes for a moment; imagine the feeling of warm sand between your toes, the gentle caress of an ocean breeze, and the rhythmic lull of waves breaking on the shore. Sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Well, you're in for a treat, because today, we’re diving headfirst into the azure waters and golden sands to unearth the absolute best beach towns in France. Trust me, it’s not just about a pretty view; it’s about an entire experience, a lifestyle, a feeling that washes over you the moment you step foot on that sun-drenched promenade. We're talking picturesque scenery, delectable cuisine, charming cultural experiences, and, of course, those incredible stretches of coastline that beckon you to kick off your shoes and just breathe. So, pack your swimsuit, slap on some sunscreen, and let’s embark on an unforgettable journey along the French Riviera, the Atlantic coast, and beyond. You ready for some serious wanderlust?

### The Glamour and Glitz of the Côte d'Azur: Where Every Sunset is a Sensation

You simply can’t talk about the **best beach towns in France** without giving a nod, or perhaps a flamboyant curtsy, to the Côte d'Azur. This isn't just a coastline; it's a legendary stretch of Mediterranean magic, a playground for the rich and famous, yet surprisingly accessible and utterly captivating for everyone else too. Think vibrant towns clinging to hillsides, azure waters so clear you can see your toes, and a permanent golden glow that seems to imbue everything with an extra touch of sparkle. It’s where art, history, and unparalleled natural beauty converge, creating an ambiance that’s uniquely, unequivocally French. Believe you me, a trip here is more than just a holiday; it's an immersion into a world of sophisticated charm and sun-kissed indulgence.

#### Saint-Tropez: The Epitome of Chic Coastal Living

If a town could wear a designer label, Saint-Tropez would be draped in the finest silk. This isn't just a place; it's a global icon, a name synonymous with luxury, yachts, and a certain *je ne sais quoi*. But scratch beneath the surface of the celebrity sightings and glittering boutiques, and you’ll find the beating heart of a charming old fishing village, still vibrant and authentic, remarkably. It really is a fascinating juxtaposition.

**Why it’s a Top Contender:**

- **Pampelonne Beach:** Oh, Pampelonne! This isn’t just a beach; it’s a legend. Stretching for miles south of the town, Pampelonne is where the action is, dotted with famous beach clubs like Nikki Beach and Club 55, where you might rub shoulders with an A-lister, or at the very least, witness some serious people-watching. But don't let the glam fool you; there are quieter stretches too, perfect for a peaceful dip. The sand, a lovely golden hue, slopes gently into the clearest blue water imagineable.
- **Vieux Port (Old Port):** The heart and soul of Saint-Tropez. Imagine a kaleidoscope of pastel-colored buildings reflecting in the water, jostling for space alongside sleek superyachts and traditional fishing boats. Grab a coffee at a waterfront cafe, watch the world go by, and soak up the atmosphere. It’s a sensory feast, let me tell you.
- **La Ponche Quarter:** If you’re looking for a taste of authentic Saint-Tropez, away from the glitz, wander through the narrow, winding streets of La Ponche. This historic fishermen's quarter is utterly charming, with its stone houses, hidden courtyards, and small, secluded beaches. It feels like stepping back in time.
- **Citadelle de Saint-Tropez:** Perched high above the town, this 17th-century fortress offers breathtaking panoramic views of the bay and the surrounding coastline. It’s a fantastic spot for a sunset picnic or just to get your bearings and appreciate the sheer beauty of the area.
- **The Food Scene:** From Michelin-starred restaurants to casual beachside eateries serving up fresh seafood, Saint-Tropez caters to every palate. Don’t leave without trying a *Tarte Tropézienne*, a sweet brioche filled with cream – it’s a local specialty and utterly divine.

**Pro Tip for Saint-Tropez Afficionados:** If you're visiting in peak season, consider taking a boat taxi from Sainte-Maxime to avoid the infamous traffic jams. Trust me on this one; it’ll save you a headache and offer stunning views to boot!

#### Nice: The Grand Dame of the Riviera

Nice isn’t just a beach town; it’s a bustling city with a coastal heart, a vibrant metropolis that seamlessly blends urban sophistication with Mediterranean charm. It's bigger, bolder, and perhaps a little less 'sleepy village' than some other spots, but its sheer energy and diverse offerings make it an absolutely unmissable destination for beach lovers and culture vultures alike. It's got something for everyone in spades.

**Why it’s a Top Contender:**

- **Promenade des Anglais:** This iconic, palm-lined promenade stretches for seven kilometers along the Bay of Angels, offering stunning views and a fantastic spot for a stroll, a cycle, or simply people-watching. The pebbled beaches alongside are famous worldwide. While some prefer sandy shores, there’s a certain charm to these smooth, sun-warmed pebbles, and the water is incredibly clear. Many private beach clubs offer loungers and parasols for a more comfortable experience.
- **Vieux Nice (Old Town):** Lose yourself in the labyrinthine streets of Vieux Nice, a captivating tangle of colourful buildings, bustling markets (Cours Saleya flower market is a must-see!), and authentic Niçoise restaurants. It's a feast for the senses, with the aroma of spices and fresh produce wafting through the air. You'll find charming boutiques, art galleries, and hidden squares.
- **Castle Hill (Colline du Château):** Ascend to Castle Hill for unparalleled panoramic views of the city, the Promenade, and the sparkling Mediterranean. While the castle itself is long gone, the park offers a waterfall, ancient ruins, and plenty of shady spots to relax. It’s a real gem.
- **Art and Culture:** Nice boasts an impressive array of museums, including the Marc Chagall National Museum and the Matisse Museum, both offering profound cultural experiences. If you're into art, you'll be chuffed to bits with what's on offer.
- **Niçoise Cuisine:** Oh my goodness, the food! Don't leave Nice without trying a *Salade Niçoise* (the real deal, not just lettuce and tuna!), *Socca* (a delicious chickpea pancake), or *Pissaladière* (an onion tart). The seafood here is also incredibly fresh and  
    delicious.

**Insider Tip for Nice Admirers:** Venture beyond the main beach clubs and seek out the public beaches east of the port, like Coco Beach, for a slightly more local vibe and excellent snorkeling opportunities.

#### Cannes: Red Carpets and Riviera Charm

Cannes is, of course, synonymous with its world-famous film festival, exuding an air of sophistication and glitz that few other places can match. But while the red carpet might be rolled out for a few weeks each year, Cannes offers year-round allure with its beautiful beaches, upscale boutiques, and a refined atmosphere that’s utterly captivating whatever time you go.

**Why it’s a Top Contender:**

- **La Croisette:** This iconic promenade is Cannes’ answer to the Promenade des Anglais, lined with luxury hotels, designer boutiques, and stunning private beaches. Stroll along, marvel at the architecture, and soak up the chic atmosphere. The beaches here are lovely, with soft sand and calm, inviting waters. Many of the luxury hotels have their own private stretches with impeccable service.
- **Plage du Midi and Plage de la Bocca:** For public beach access and a slightly more local feel, head west of the main port to Plage du Midi or Plage de la Bocca. These sandy beaches are popular with families and offer excellent facilities, making them perfect for a relaxing day by the sea. They're generally less crowded than the ""Croisette"" beaches, too, allowing for a bit more stretching out room.
- **Le Suquet (Old Town):** Perched on a hill overlooking the Bay of Cannes, Le Suquet is the charming historic heart of the town. Wander through its steep, winding streets, discover hidden restaurants serving traditional Provençal cuisine, and enjoy panoramic views from the top, especially beautiful at sunset. It’s a delightful escape from the bustle of the Croisette.
- **Îles de Lérins:** A short boat trip from Cannes will take you to these picturesque islands. Sainte-Marguerite is famous for its fort, which once housed the Man in the Iron Mask, and its serene pine forests. Saint-Honorat is home to a working monastery and vineyards. Both offer stunning coves for swimming and a peaceful respite from the mainland.
- **The Food Scene:** Cannes boasts an array of gourmet restaurants, but also plenty of charming bistros and markets where you can sample local specialties. Don't miss out on trying fresh seafood, of course.

### Atlantic Allure: Rugged Coasts and Surfing Havens

Leaving the sun-drenched sophistication of the Mediterranean behind, we venture to France’s Atlantic coast, a region whose beauty is altogether different, yet equally compelling. Think wilder landscapes, powerful rolling waves, and a bracing freshness in the air. This side of France is a haven for surfers, nature lovers, and anyone who appreciates a more rugged, untamed beauty. It’s less about sipping rosé on a private beach and more about embracing the raw power of the ocean, the invigorating salt spray, and the expansive feeling of endless horizons.

#### Biarritz: The Surfing Capital with Victorian Charm

Alright, so picture this: a grand coastal resort town, brimming with opulent Belle Époque architecture, looking out onto a vast expanse of ocean that, at any given moment, could unleash some of the best surf breaks in Europe. That, my friends, is Biarritz in a nutshell. It’s got an air of aristocratic elegance, but with a wonderfully laid-back, surf-town vibe underneath it all. It’s a brilliant contradiction, really.

**Why it’s a Top Contender:**

- **Grande Plage:** The main beach in Biarritz is a sweeping crescent of golden sand, framed by elegant hotels, the iconic Casino, and the town's famous striped beach tents. It’s absolutely stunning and perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and, of course, watching the surfers catch waves. There’s always an electric atmosphere here.
- **Côte des Basques:** Arguably the most famous surf spot in Biarritz, Côte des Basques is a broad sandy beach that stretches south, offering incredible views of the Spanish coast on a clear day. When the tide is out, it's popular for walking, but as the tide comes in, it becomes a mecca for surfers of all levels. It's a truly spectacular place to learn or simply observe the pros.
- **Plage Marbella and Plage de la Milady:** Further south, these beaches offer a more relaxed atmosphere, popular with families and those looking for a bit more space. Marbella, in particular, is known for its excellent surf breaks for intermediate surfers.
- **The Rocher de la Vierge (Virgin's Rock):** This iconic landmark, a statue of the Virgin Mary perched on a dramatic rock formation accessible by a pedestrian bridge designed by Gustave Eiffel, offers breathtaking views of the coastline, stretching all the way to the Pyrenees. It’s a must-see.
- **Les Halles de Biarritz:** For a true taste of local life, head to the bustling covered market, Les Halles. Here you’ll find an array of fresh seafood, local cheeses, Basque charcuterie, and delicious pastries. Grab some oysters and a glass of crisp white wine – a quintessential Biarritz experience.
- **Thalassotherapy:** Biarritz is renowned for its thalassotherapy centers, offering treatments using seawater for its therapeutic benefits. It’s the perfect way to unwind after a day of surfing or sightseeing.

**Local Insight for Biarritz Visitors:** If you're a beginner surfer, many surf schools operate on Grande Plage and Côte des Basques, offering lessons and board rentals. Don’t be shy; give it a go!

#### Cap Ferret: Bohemian Bliss on the Bassin d'Arcachon

Now, if Biarritz is the grand dame, Cap Ferret is her effortlessly chic, bohemian cousin. Situated on a narrow peninsula that separates the wild Atlantic Ocean from the calm waters of the Bassin d'Arcachon, Cap Ferret offers a unique duality of experiences: crashing waves on one side, tranquil oyster beds on the other. It’s a place for understated luxury, natural beauty, and a deeply relaxed pace of life. You won't find glitz here, but you'll find an abundance of chic simplicity.

**Why it’s a Top Contender:**

- **Atlantic Ocean Beaches:** On the ocean side, you’ll find vast, windswept sandy beaches backed by towering dunes and pine forests. These beaches, like Plage de l'Horizon and Grand Crohot, are perfect for surfing, bodyboarding, or long, exhilarating walks. The waves here can be impressive, offering thrilling conditions for water sports enthusiasts.
- **Bassin d'Arcachon Beaches:** In stark contrast, the beaches on the Bassin d'Arcachon side are calm, shallow, and perfect for families with young children. These tranquil waters are ideal for swimming, paddleboarding, and kayaking. Many offer views of the iconic Dune du Pilat across the bay.
- **Oyster Villages (Villages Ostréicoles):** This is where Cap Ferret truly shines. Dotted along the Bassin de Arcachon, these charming, colourful villages are home to oyster farmers. You can sit right by the water’s edge and feast on incredibly fresh oysters straight from the beds, often accompanied by a glass of local white wine. It's an authentic, unforgettable culinary experience.
- **Phare du Cap Ferret (Lighthouse):** Climb the 258 steps of the lighthouse for breathtaking panoramic views of the entire peninsula, the Bassin d'Arcachon, and the Atlantic. It’s well worth the effort.
- **Dune du Pilat (Across the Bay):** While not technically in Cap Ferret, the tallest sand dune in Europe is a spectacular sight just across the Bassin. You can take a ferry from Cap Ferret to visit it and even climb to the top for incredible views. It’s a truly magnificent natural wonder.

**Foodie Pointer for Cap Ferret:** Seriously, do not miss the oysters! They are the freshest you’ll ever taste. Pair them with a glass of local *vin blanc* and some rye bread and butter. You'll thank me.

### Hidden Gems and Lesser-Known Havens: The Best Beach Towns in France Beyond the Usual Suspects

While the Côte d'Azur and the Atlantic coast boast some of the most famous and undeniably beautiful beach towns in France, there’s a whole world of coastal charm waiting to be discovered off the well-trodden path. Sometimes, the most authentic and memorable experiences are found in those places that haven't quite made it onto every tourist brochure. These towns offer a different kind of magic – perhaps a quieter charm, a more rugged beauty, or a deeper connection to local life. So, for those of you who appreciate a bit of adventure and the thrill of uncovering something special, let’s explore some of France’s delightful coastal secrets.

#### Saint-Malo: Walled City Wonders in Brittany

Now, if you're picturing sun-kissed Mediterranean beaches, you might be surprised by Saint-Malo. This isn’t your typical beach town; it’s a fortified city with an incredible history, perched dramatically on the rugged coastline of Brittany. Known as the ""Cité Corsaire"" (City of Corsairs), Saint-Malo's impressive ramparts encircle a bustling town, offering a unique blend of maritime history, vibrant culture, and stunning sandy beaches right on its doorstep.

**Why it’s a Top Contender:**

- **The Ramparts:** Walking atop Saint-Malo’s magnificent granite ramparts is an experience in itself. This nearly two-kilometre circuit offers incredible views of the city, the surrounding coastline, and the tidal islands. It's like stepping back in time, and the sea air is invigorating.
- **Plage du Sillon:** Just outside the city walls, Plage du Sillon is a vast, beautiful sandy beach stretching for several kilometers. It's perfect for long walks, kite-surfing, or simply relaxing. When the tide is out, the beach becomes enormous, revealing fascinating rock formations.
- **Grand Bé and Petit Bé:** These two small islands, accessible on foot at low tide, are must-visits. Grand Bé is the final resting place of the famous French writer Chateaubriand, and Petit Bé is home to a wonderfully preserved fort. Just be sure to check the tide times carefully, as the path quickly disappears!
- **Old Town (Intra-Muros):** Explore the cobbled streets within the city walls, packed with charming shops, crêperies (Brittany is the land of crêpes!), and seafood restaurants. The atmosphere is lively and utterly enchanting.
- **Seafood Galore:** Being a major port, Saint-Malo is legendary for its fresh seafood. Oysters, mussels, scallops, and ""fruits de mer"" platters are absolute must-tries here. Pair them with a crisp Breton cider – divine!

**Traveler’s Hint for Saint-Malo:** The tides in Saint-Malo are among the highest in Europe. It's truly fascinating to witness the dramatic change in the coastline between high and low tide. Plan your beach visits and island walks accordingly.

#### Cassis: A Mediterranean Postcard Without the Crowds

While bustling Marseille is just a stone's throw away, Cassis feels like a world apart. Hidden away on the captivating Côte Bleue, east of Marseille, this charming fishing village is a true Mediterranean gem. It’s smaller, more intimate, and utterly picturesque, boasting stunning limestone cliffs, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and a delightful harbor. It offers a taste of the Riviera’s beauty without the sometimes-overwhelming crowds of its more famous neighbours.

**Why it’s a Top Contender:**

- **Calanques National Park:** This is the undisputed star of the show. Cassis is the gateway to the breathtaking Calanques, a series of fjord-like inlets with towering white cliffs, hidden coves, and exceptionally clear, emerald-green waters. You can hike to them for spectacular views and secluded swimming spots (Calanque d'En-Vau is particularly stunning), or take a boat tour from Cassis harbor for a different perspective.
- **Plage de la Grande Mer and Plage du Bestouan:** Cassis has two main beaches, both lovely. Plage de la Grande Mer is the main town beach, a lively spot with a mix of sand and pebbles, perfect for families. Plage du Bestouan, a little further out, is generally quieter, with lovely views of the cliffs. Both offer that irresistible azure water.
- **Charming Port:** The heart of Cassis is its small, picturesque port, lined with colourful fishing boats, quaint cafes, and seafood restaurants. It’s the perfect place to sit back, enjoy a glass of local Cassis wine, and watch the world go by.
- **Cap Canaille:** Europe’s highest sea cliff, Cap Canaille, towers majestically over Cassis, offering truly astounding panoramic views of the town, the Calanques, and the sea. Drive the scenic Route des Crêtes (Road of the Ridges) for some unforgettable photo opportunities.
- **Local Wine:** Cassis is also a wine-producing region, famous for its crisp white wines, which pair perfectly with the local seafood. Visit a vineyard for a tasting, and you won’t be disappointed.

**Practical Advice for Cassis Explorers:** If you plan on hiking in the Calanques during summer, go early in the morning to beat the heat and the crowds. Always carry plenty of water, and wear sturdy shoes. Some routes are closed during periods of high fire risk, so check local conditions beforehand.

#### Le Touquet-Paris-Plage: The Chic Escape of the Opal Coast

Perhaps less known internationally than the Riviera, but certainly a favourite among Parisians and Northern Europeans, Le Touquet-Paris-Plage is a remarkably chic and sophisticated resort town on France’s Opal Coast. This isn't about rugged beauty; it's about expansive golden sands, elegant architecture, vibrant activities, and a decidedly family-friendly atmosphere. Think of it as a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively, from the bustling city.

**Why it’s a Top Contender:**

- **Vast Sandy Beach:** Le Touquet boasts an enormous, pristine sandy beach that stretches for miles. It’s perfect for long walks, sandcastle building, kite-flying, or simply basking in the sun. The gentle slope makes it very safe for children, and there’s ample space even in peak season. You’ll see beach huts dotting the landscape, adding to the charm.
- **Belle Époque Architecture:** Wander through the town, and you’ll be struck by the beautiful Belle Époque and Art Deco villas, many nestled amidst lush pine forests. It's a truly elegant setting that speaks to its history as an upscale holiday destination.
- **Watersports Hub:** From land yachting (sailing on wheels!) to kiteboarding, paddleboarding, and even golf, Le Touquet offers a plethora of activities. It’s a dynamic place where there’s always something exciting to do, catering to adventurists and those seeking gentle leisure alike.
- **A Lively Town Center:** The town’s main street, Rue Saint-Jean, is bustling with shops, restaurants, and cafes, perfect for a leisurely stroll and some retail therapy. The market is also a fantastic place to gather local produce and regional specialities.
- **Family-Friendly Attractions:** With an excellent aqua park (Aqualud), horse riding, tennis courts, and numerous playgrounds, Le Touquet is a fantastic choice for families looking for an active and engaging beach holiday.

**Le Touquet Local Tip:** If you're a golf enthusiast, Le Touquet offers two magnificent golf courses, La Forêt and La Mer, considered among the best in France. Book your tee times in advance, especially during the high season!

### Planning Your French Coastal Escape: Practical Tips for Finding the Best Beach Towns in France

So, you’re convinced, right? France’s coastline beckons with an irresistible allure, offering a buffet of experiences, from sun-drenched glamour to rugged natural beauty. But with so many incredible options, how do you pick the perfect spot for your next holiday? It’s not just about pointing at a map; it's about aligning your desires with what each location offers. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate the glorious options and ensure your French coastal adventure is everything you’ve dreamed of and more.

#### Choosing Your Vibe: What Kind of Beach Goer Are You?

Before you even start looking at flights and hotels, take a moment to really think about what you want from your beach holiday. Are you a thrill-seeker, a quiet contemplative, or somewhere in between?

1. **The Glamour Seeker:** If your idea of a perfect beach vacation involves designer boutiques, Michelin-starred dining, superyachts, and the chance of spotting a celebrity, then the French Riviera (Saint-Tropez, Cannes, Nice) is calling your name. Expect a vibrant social scene and plenty of opportunities for people-watching.
2. **The Active Adventurer:** If you crave exhilarating watersports, dramatic landscapes, and a bracingly fresh ocean breeze, the Atlantic coast (Biarritz, with its epic surf, or Cap Ferret for kayaking and paddleboarding) will be right up your alley. Hiking, cycling, and embracing the elements are all part of the package here.
3. **The History Buff/Culture Vulture:** For those who love to blend beach time with a deep dive into local history and culture, destinations like Saint-Malo in Brittany, with its fortified city and fascinating past, or even Nice, with its world-class museums, offer the perfect blend.
4. **The Family Fun Fan:** Looking for safe, sandy beaches, plenty of activities for the kids, and a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere? Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, with its vast sands and family-friendly amenities, or the calmer side of Cap Ferret on the Bassin d'Arcachon, are excellent choices.
5. **The Tranquility Seeker:** If escaping the crowds, finding secluded coves, and reconnecting with nature is your priority, then places like Cassis, with its stunning Calanques, or the quieter stretches of beach on the Atlantic without the main resort buzz, might be your ideal retreat.

#### Best Time to Visit: Weather, Crowds, and Cost

- **Summer (July-August):** This is peak season. Think hot, sunny weather, lively atmospheres, and all attractions fully open. However, expect larger crowds and higher prices for accommodation and flights. If you love a bustling scene, this is your time! Book well in advance.
- **Shoulder Seasons (May-June and September-October):** These are often the sweet spots. The weather is generally pleasant (warm but not scorching), the crowds are thinner, and prices are more reasonable. The sea is usually warm enough for swimming, especially in September. This is arguably the best time to visit for a balanced experience.
- **Winter (November-April):** While some coastal towns might be quieter, many, especially on the Côte d'Azur, remain vibrant. Temperatures are mild, but swimming might only be for the very brave! This is a great time for cultural visits, long walks, and enjoying the local cuisine without the tourist crush. Prices are at their lowest.

#### Getting Around: Transport Tips

- **Flying:** Major airports serving the best beach towns in France include Nice (for the Côte d'Azur), Bordeaux (for the Atlantic coast including Cap Ferret), and Rennes (for Brittany, including Saint-Malo). From there, you can rent a car, use local trains, or taxis.
- **Trains:** France has an excellent rail network (SNCF). High-speed TGV trains connect Paris to many major cities, and regional TER trains can get you to smaller coastal towns. It’s often a very scenic way to travel.
- **Rental Car:** For ultimate flexibility and to explore charming villages and hidden coves, a rental car is highly recommended, especially on the Atlantic coast or if you plan to venture into the Calanques near Cassis.
- **Local Transport:** Many towns offer good local bus networks, and walking or cycling are popular ways to get around within the towns themselves, especially in pedestrianized areas.

#### Accommodation: From Budget to Boutique

France offers a vast spectrum of accommodation options:

- **Luxury Hotels:** Found in abundance in destinations like Saint-Tropez, Cannes, and Biarritz.
- **Boutique Hotels &amp; Guesthouses:** Charming and often family-run, offering a more personal touch.
- **Holiday Apartments/Villas (Gîtes):** Excellent for families or longer stays, offering self-catering convenience.
- **Camping:** Very popular across France, with many campsites offering excellent facilities, often right by the beach.
- **Chambres d’Hôtes:** The French equivalent of a B&amp;B, providing an intimate stay and often a delicious home-cooked breakfast.

When the eyes were up, people paid almost three times more into the collective coffee fund than when the flowers were up. That’s the only thing that changed: eyes or no eyes.

After 24 hours, I filed a missing persons report. I barely slept for two days, helped organize a small search group, and was constantly posting on social media. Her family was panicking too.

Then—on day 3—I get a call from a mutual acquaintance saying they saw her… at IHOP. Just sitting there, completely fine, eating breakfast like nothing happened.

I rush over and yeah, it’s her. Alive, calm, sipping coffee. I asked what happened, and she just said she “needed to disconnect” and left her phone behind on purpose. No heads-up, no note, nothing.

I told her I was relieved she was okay but also upset. I poured all this energy and panic into looking for her. She told me I was overreacting and being dramatic, and that it’s “not her responsibility to manage other people’s emotions.”

I’m working on rebuilding a community and making new friends in the area. I’ve been going to shows, checking out events, and reconnecting with a few old friends who still live nearby, but I’m looking to grow that circle more.

I’m a 35m dad with a 4 yo son. He’s my world, so everything I do is with him in mind, but I’m also carving out space to rebuild a full life for myself. I live in Stillwater and head into Minneapolis often for fun; music, food, events, that kind of thing. I’m also part of a CrossFit gym in Stillwater, which has been great for meeting people, though not many single folks (you don’t move to the suburbs for the singles scene, apparently).

If anyone has suggestions—groups, events, places where cool people hang out—I’d love to hear them. Or if you’re in a similar boat and want to grab coffee or hit a park sometime, I’m down for that too. Thanks in advance!

I’ve been thinking a lot about how hard it’s become to meet people *offline* in a way that feels natural, fun, and low-pressure — especially if you’re genuinely looking for a connection, not just a swipe or a hookup.

So here’s the idea:  
What if we created a **Singles Club** — an in-person (and optionally online) community for single people who are *intentionally dating* and want to meet others in the same mindset?

**The vibe:**

* Not a matchmaking service, not a speed dating gimmick
* Think weekly meetups: coffee shop socials, activity-based hangouts, group dinners, themed events
* Everyone who shows up is single, open to dating, and there for good vibes — no pressure to pair up immediately
* Could include light intros or “dating rounds” if people are open, but the goal is a community, not just matches

**Why it might work:**

* Cuts out the fatigue and weirdness of apps
* Builds real-life chemistry
* Creates a safe, recurring space to meet people organically
* Bonus: it could build friendships too

Would anyone be interested in something like this? If so, what kind of events would appeal to you, and would you actually show up?

Just throwing this out there to see if it resonates. Let’s bring back the joy of real connections.

After years of being the pudgy girl I lost a nice amount of weight when I was 18 drinking Stok cold brew coffee. I would have some with almond milk and sugar for breakfast and fast until lunch with no cravings or issues whatsoever. Losing weight was a breeze.

I’m 24 now and for the past 2(?) ish years I’ve been drinking instant coffee to save money. Basically any brand. They all taste bad and weird and chemically but I figured it was better for my wallet in the long run since a bottle of Stok is like $5 and has to be replaced every week or so.

Whenever I drink my instant coffee I almost always still have cravings in the morning, even on days when I have a big bowl of cottage cheese with berries, eggs, etc., filling food! I’ve just been constantly feeling hungry, and nothing is ever enough.

My boyfriend offered to buy me groceries this week so I picked up a bottle of Stok for old times sake. Firstly. It’s so delicious. It tastes as good if not better than iced coffee from a coffee shop, which in turn leaves me more satisfied and less likely to waste money on a coffee while I’m out. Secondly. I’ve been drinking it in the morning and my weird insulin symptoms like fatigue, cravings, extreme hunger pains, are GONE. I just feel sustained, calm, fresh energy. I went for a huge walk yesterday morning!

I’m noticing while drinking Stok again I’m having WAY less cravings in general and have been more in control of what I eat. When I was drinking instant coffee I was like split personality — a demon would overtake me and I’d be unable to resist a binge of random foods, a McDonald’s order when I just ate lunch, etc.

Idk if this is placebo effect. But I’m immediately noticing a marked difference. It’s gonna be more expensive for me to drink this but $5 for a bottle for a week or two is certainly better than a $5 coffee every single day.

Give it a try! If anyone else likes Stok, lmk! My fave combo is just with some sort of nut milk and regular sugar. :)",11,1750517456.0,1200isplenty,41,0.69,False

I’ve read through this subreddit many times so I figured it would help. It’s been almost two months since I left the psychiatric ward, and have been recently diagnosed with OCD. I originally was hospitalized for an OD after an ocd/depression breakdown, so it’s been a bit hard to acclimate myself to society.

I can’t get a job, and am terrified of going back to school.

I have a great support circle, have four tight night friends, and prefer to go out by myself like to galleries or walking around the city for a coffee.

It happened in Mrs. Henderson’s math class, right after lunch.  

The boy sitting in front of me—Timmy, I think his name was—turned around to ask for a pencil.  

And that’s when I saw it.  

His face rippled, like water disturbed by a stone.  

His reflection in the window blinked a second too late.  

His smile stayed on just a little too long—like it had to think about being a smile.  

I told my teacher. She squinted at me like I’d just announced I was from Mars.  

“Maybe you need glasses,” she said, adjusting her own.  

I told the nurse. She shone a light in my eyes and asked if I’d hit my head.  

“No,” I said. “But his face did this thing—”  

“Hmm,” she interrupted, scribbling something on a clipboard. “Let’s keep an eye on that.”  

The second time it happened, I was twelve.

We were at the grocery store, and Mom was arguing with the cashier over a coupon.  

I was bored, so I started people-watching.  

That’s when I saw him—a man in a suit, standing by the magazine rack.  

At first, he looked normal.  

Then his shadow moved on its own.  

It stretched too far, too fast, like it was trying to escape him.  

And his eyes—  

They flickered, just for a second, from brown to gold.  

I tugged on Mom’s sleeve.  

“Mom, that man—”  

She didn’t even look. “Not now, Naya.”  

“But his eyes—”  

“Naya,” she snapped, “stop making up stories. People will talk.”  

That’s when I learned three things:  

1. I’m very good at noticing things.  
2. Most people hate being noticed.  
3. The world is not what it looks like—and no one wants to talk about it.  

I’ve always seen too much. Thought too much. Felt everything.

The terms changed over the years—ADHD, HPI, gifted, “sensitive,” “intense,” “not living up to potential.”  

School said I was a genius.  

Deadlines said otherwise.  

I don’t “hyperfocus for twelve hours.” I get lost for five minutes and forget what I was doing.  

I spiral down rabbit holes for days, collecting encyclopedias of things no one needs.  

I procrastinate until the anxiety explodes, and then I burn myself out trying to fix what I couldn’t start.  

Sometimes I can’t follow simple instructions.  

Sometimes I forget how to begin.  

I’m not lazy.  

I’m not careless.  

I’m just wired like a storm that won’t land.  

Now I’m thirty-two.

I have a PhD in Anomalous Systems Engineering—which is a polite way of saying:  

I study patterns that shouldn’t exist.  

The data that doesn’t behave.  

The math that makes people nervous.  

This morning I spilled coffee on my lecture notes, left my ID in the fridge, and still beat the department chair to work.  

Victory is relative.  

My 9:30 lecture is on Anomalous Pattern Integrity in Chaotic Systems.

Which is ironic, since half my students can’t remember which room we’re in unless I post it, email it, and pin it in three group chats.  

I set up at the podium, open my laptop, and pull my notes from the university cloud.  

The projector flickers once—because it’s older than half the student body—and then settles.  

“Take weather,” I say, pacing slowly. “You can’t predict the exact temperature next Tuesday, but you know it won’t be 800 degrees and raining frogs. Probably.”  

A few students laugh. The rest stare like I’ve personally offended their sleep schedule.  

I scroll down to a fractal pattern on the projector, zooming in.  

“Order isn’t the opposite of chaos,” I tell them. “It’s hidden inside it. That’s the trick.”  

That’s when it happens.  

Third row, left side. A student shifts in his chair.  

And for one half-second, his shadow doesn’t follow.  

It lags. Just a beat.  

And when it catches up—  

It’s wrong.  

Horns. Claws. Just for a blink.  

The shape his body shouldn’t make.  

I freeze mid-sentence.  

His eyes meet mine—only for a moment.  

But it’s like being looked at by someone wearing a mask inside their own face.  

Not hostile.  

Not human, either.  

Then he blinks. Smiles faintly. Looks down at his notes.  

I blink too.  

The projector has already switched slides. I didn’t touch anything.  

“Sorry,” I say out loud. “Bit of a tech hiccup.”  

No one reacts.  

No one else saw it.  

Of course they didn’t.  

They never do.  

After class, I take the back stairs down to the staff hallway.

It’s quieter there. Dimmer.  

Smells faintly of printer ink and burnt coffee from the cursed department Keurig.  

I stop by the mailroom out of habit.  

Mostly I get admin memos, campus-wide spam, and once, a threatening letter from Facilities about unplugging my office heater.  

But today…  

There’s a manila envelope sitting in my cubby.  

No name. No logo. Just thick paper folded inside.  

My name is typed on the front. That’s it. No sender. No return info.  

No “From the Desk of Someone Important.”  

I glance around. The hallway’s empty. Just the hum of the vending machine and the dull clink of someone’s forgotten lunch spoon hitting plastic in the microwave.  

I open it.  

One sheet. Heavy stock. No watermark.  

Just six words, centered on the page:  

\*you see us dont you\*  

No caps. No punctuation.  

Not a question. A statement.  

My heart doesn’t pound. I don’t drop the paper.  

I just… go very, very still.  

Because whoever sent this didn’t just guess.  

They know what I saw.  

What I’ve been seeing.  

I fold the paper in half.  

Then again.  

Then again.  

Tuck it into the back pocket of my notebook.  

I’m not ready to panic.  

Not yet.  

But something’s shifting.  

I can feel it.  

The pattern’s cracking.  

And someone else is watching me now.  

I don’t tell anyone about the note.  

Not because I don’t trust them—though, let’s be honest, I don’t—but because I don’t know what to say.  

“Hey, I think I’m being stalked by someone who knows I can see through glamours”?  

Yeah, that’ll go over well.  

Instead, I do what I always do when I don’t know what to do:  

I hyperfocus on something else.  

In this case, it’s the fractal pattern from my lecture.  

I pull up the equations on my laptop, zooming in and out until my eyes hurt.  

There’s something there—something I’m missing.  

A pattern within the pattern.  

A glitch in the system.  

I don’t notice the time passing until my phone buzzes.  

It’s a reminder I set for myself earlier:  

\*Eat something. You forgot lunch again.\*  

I glance at the clock.  

It’s 7:32 p.m.  

I’ve been sitting here for four hours.  

I sigh, rubbing my temples.  

This is why I can’t have nice things.  

Or, you know, a normal life.  

Later that night, I can’t stop thinking about the student with the lagging shadow.  

Who was he?  

What was he?  

And why did he smile at me like he knew something I didn’t?  

I pull up the class roster on my laptop, scrolling through the names and photos.  

There he is: \*Ethan Carter.\*  

But when I click on his profile, it’s blank.  

No email. No phone number. No emergency contact.  

Just a name and a photo that looks… off.  

I zoom in.  

His eyes are the wrong color.  

In the lecture hall, they were brown.  

In the photo, they’re gold.  

I close the laptop.  

My hands are shaking.  

This is bad.  

This is very, very bad.  

Before I go to bed, I take the note out of my notebook and unfold it.  

I hold it up to the light, looking for hidden marks or watermarks.  

Nothing.  

But then I notice something:  

The paper smells faintly of lavender and something else—something sharp, like ozone.  

It’s not a human smell.  

I fold the note back up and tuck it under my pillow.  

Maybe it’s stupid.  

Maybe it’s dangerous.  

But I can’t let it out of my sight.  Not yet.

I honestly, swear to fuck, thought he was home and just hoped up in the bedroom bc of the heatwave. it took me all day to find out the master bedroom was empty the WHOLE time. it's not out of character for him to not show up or ill miss him when he does so I literally thought nothing of it. it's also normal for him to be gone for random times like to an hour to a business week. where? my uncle's house, the next town over WHO FUCKING KNOWS BC HE DOESNT TELL ANYONE SO ILL JUST ASSUME HE BATMAN !!! HE DOESNT HAVE A JOB !!!

that's besides the point. the point is: from the day I got out the hospital to yesterday, bro was gone. normal tho 

I asked my mom bc he was gone overnight and she seemed really annoyed bringing him up and said he was watching the nba finals with my uncle so I was like ""oh cool. I sure hope daddy's team wins"" and watched some bs movie with her. then my dad comes home like an hour before mom does. which is weird

my dad made a habit of always picking my mom from the bus/train station since she got hit by a car and it made her partially disabled. he checks the schedule and sits there waiting for her, walk her home, and share a smoke on the porch of our house. he does the same when I was away at uni and came home on weekends. take my bags or hold the umbrella if it's raining and walk with me home. it's not like its far either. its like 1-2 blocks.

so him coming home without her was beyond weird, especially because he only stayed for less than 20 minutes.

he came home, hugged me, changed his clothes bc it was hot outside, handed me some (melted) chocolate, said uncle was having a BBQ and he was leaving. then...left (??)

it was weird. bizarre even. however, not that out of character or alarming for my dad to do. one time he said he was going to the store and came back 5 hours later with a new winter coat for me. 

Not shortly after, my mom comes home and i was like 
""oh did you see daddy?""
""no. is he looking for me?"" but she was mad asl when she asked. woah whats all the animosity 😰

I unknowingly brought my dad a few more times bc he literally popped in for 15 minutes, telling her he gave me some chocolates. all of the sudden she just pulls me to the side and tells me ""I don't think your father is going to live with us anymore""

MY DAD...!? 

If she told me this 4 years ago, I'd be jumping for joy. however, I just repaired my issues with my dad and feel like I actually have a father after wishing for one since I was 3. he's emotionally absent, lowkey physically absent, we argue all the time, mightve killed my cat, used to hit me and made me think all men were evil until I was like 13 but he's my dad.

he spontaneously bought me a sewing machine because my old one broke, paid for my tuition, cooks when I'm sick... MY DADDY??☹️ not LIVING WITH ME ???

it's not the first time they argued and I remember when I was at uni that apparently my dad was missing (??) for the whole week and acted like nothing happened when I came home and picked me up from the station like usual. were they arguing then too...?

Ugh it's so complicated but it was bound to happen. he literally has 3 other kids he left in a different state to have me and be with my mom. why wouldn't he leave again...

The TDLR is I can write long ass shit. Get a coffee. Intro: GameStop’s Symbolic Siege: An Investigative Financial Report
Introduction
In the saga of GameStop Corp. (GME), financial fundamentals and internet culture have become inextricably intertwined. What began as a meme-stock frenzy in 2021 has evolved into a complex theater of symbolic narrative and high-stakes financial engineering. On one front is the passionate community led (and entertained) by figures like Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill), where memes, cryptic posts, and even NFTs carry perceived clues about GameStop’s “endgame.” On the other front, Wall Street adversaries and market mechanisms have adapted – from novel exchange-traded funds to algorithmic content moderation – aiming to contain the volatility and influence of this movement. This investigative report examines the key developments shaping GameStop’s ongoing transformation, including: 
•	Memetic Narrative Engineering: How Roaring Kitty’s return was orchestrated like a three-act Prestige magic trick and the role of symbolic tactics (content throttling, digital art personas) in rallying investors. 
•	Financial Alchemy at GameStop: The company’s pivot to a Bitcoin treasury strategy and zerointerest convertible bonds, which fortified its balance sheet while potentially setting a trap for short sellers. 
•	Crypto Integration: The launch of the GameStop Wallet and NFT-gated platform (“The Chamber”), demonstrating an unprecedented fusion of shareholder community with crypto collectibles and exclusive content. 
•	Market Structure Countermoves: The introduction of products like the Bitwise GME Option Income** ETF (ticker: IGME) and options-based strategies that could dampen GME’s explosive potential, alongside an analysis of short sellers’ motives in backing such instruments. 
•	Evidence and Data: A synthesis of view-throttling logs, short-seller strategy matrices, and encrypted NFT ciphers that together paint a picture of modern “financial warfare” – where information control and symbolism are as pivotal as cash flow and debt coven

My friend had a baby the same day I did! Both about 7 weeks. It’s been really cool to see our paths cross in this way. That being said, she is thriving and i am surviving. Forewarning: this is not a “woe is me pity party”- I’m purely trying to paint a picture of two experiences. 

Im averaging 4 hours of sleep per night, sometimes just getting 2.5 hours total. Her baby is consistently sleeping 6+ hours straight per night. She is always put together and I’m in my maternity leggings and a stained sweatshirt. She got the professional photoshoot done with her little family, I’m lucky if my baby stops crying long enough to take one non-tear stained photo on my phone. She goes out to meals, goes to the water park, to the aquarium, etc. and I’m lucky to get outside once a day for a short walk if baby isn’t cluster feeding or blowing out a diaper. My husband doesn’t want us going anywhere (literally anywhere, like stay inside 24/7) yet because he is terrified of our little one catching something, so my cabin fever is pretty rough. We’ve gone out 2x since birth to places other than dr appts. Target and a coffee shop. Those outings felt like Disneyland. 

Now, please don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my little one so much and I wouldn’t trade them for anything.. but I am SO over this phase. Is what I’m experiencing baby blues? Or just that comparison is the thief of joy? My doom scrolling tells me that my experience is more typical but it’s SO HARD to have someone who is seemingly hitting the lottery at every turn.

I should have asked more questions.,"It was awful being laid off so suddenly, but it didn’t take me too long to find a new administration job. The new job didn’t pay as well as my old job, but I hoped the salary was enough that I could keep my house. After racking up five thousand dollars in credit card debt over the next few months, though—even though it broke my heart—I decided I had to move. I called my realtor and told her that my daughter, Leela, and I needed to find someplace else to live.

I looked at houses all over the city, but even the houses I didn’t like were more than I could afford. I’d nearly given up when my realtor showed me the house on Maple Drive. Seeing it, I felt like my prayers had been answered. The house was in the same neighborhood as Leela’s and my old house. It was only a ten-minute walk to Leela’s school. It had two bedrooms, just like our old house, and a big basement for Leela to play in.

“It’s a bit of a fixer-upper,” my realtor said. “But it has a lot of potential. Is your husband good with his hands?”

“I’m single,” I said, a little offended he’d ask me that.  “Who used to live in the house?”

“A nice, older couple, Martha and Rupert. Martha was a teacher here in town. Her husband, Rupert, worked as an auto mechanic.”

“Why are they selling their house for so little money?”

“They’re not selling it, the bank is. Martha passed away and then Rupert—from what I heard, he just disappeared.”

“Disappeared?”

“The neighbors hadn’t seen him for a while. They worried something had happened to him, so they called the police. The police searched the house, but he wasn’t there. They think he moved in with some of his relatives in Nebraska and just didn’t tell anybody. He stopped making his mortgage payments and the bank repossessed the house and put it on the market.”

The story seemed strange, but I didn’t think too much of it. If I were older and struggling to pay my mortgage, I could picture myself running from my bills, too. Who cares about good credit when you only have a few years left to live? The house was just too good of a deal to pass up.

I’m not that handy, but the repairs didn’t look too hard. I’d repaint everything. Change the doors and windows. Sand and re-stain the hardwood. I’d never done any work like that before but, nowadays, you can learn how to do everything on YouTube. Whatever repairs I couldn’t do myself, as soon as I managed to save some money, I’d hire a contractor to do the work.

The first few weeks after Leela and I moved into the house were great. We unpacked our things and settled in. But then I started noticing even more little problems I hadn’t noticed before. Water leaked out from the dishwasher whenever I ran it. The pipes creaked all night long. The bathroom light flickered whenever I turned it on, no matter how many times I changed the bulb. None of these problems were too bad, but they were enough to keep me up at night, worrying I’d made a big mistake by buying the house and not just renting an apartment.

“At night, I keep hearing scratching noises in the basement,” Leela told me.

“It’s an old house, sweetheart,” I said. “Old houses make a lot of noises.”

My next-door neighbor, Janine, was an older woman about the same age as my mom. Not much longer after Leela and I moved in, she introduced herself and asked how Leela and I were doing.

“The house is a big project,” I told her. “I thought I’d be up for it, but now I’m not so sure. Fixing everything wrong with this house is going to take a lot more work than I thought it would. I hope I didn’t make a huge mistake.”

“Do you have anybody in your family who’s handy?”

“All my family lives in Chicago. I’m the only one out here in Wisconsin.”

“I’m sure you’ll get the house looking the way you want it to sooner than you think. It’s a great house. I knew the old owners pretty well. That house was everything to them. They bought it brand new and lived in it for close to sixty years. The husband, Rupert, always had some kind of renovation project he was working on.”

“I heard he left to live with some family in Nebraska.”

“That’s what they said. What I think, though—I think they just haven’t found his body yet.”

“What do you mean?”

“Rupert depended on Martha for everything. After she died, he wasn’t the same. He loved going for long walks on the trails in the State Forest. I think he went out for one of his long walks and just didn’t come back.”

I tried my best to ignore all the little problems in that house, but after another month of leaking water and flickering lights and creaking pipes, I couldn’t take it anymore. I watched a few YouTube videos and tried to start fixing things myself. I didn’t have much luck, though. No matter how easy the YouTube videos made it look, it was always harder when I did it.

Right as I was about to give up and beg the bank to take the house back, though, something strange happened. All the little problems in the house started fixing themselves.

I ran the dishwasher, and no water leaked out. I turned on the bathroom light and the light didn’t flicker anymore.

“It’s incredible,” I told Janine. “It’s like the house is fixing itself.”

Of course, I didn’t really believe that. I told myself the dishwasher had somehow managed to tighten its own pipes back together. The wires in the bathroom had miraculously uncrossed themselves. Looking back, I feel so dumb now.

Other strange things started happening around the house, too. I swore I’d closed my bedroom door before leaving for work (I hated Leela going into my room), but when I got home, the door would be open. I never misplaced my clothes but, every now and then, a shirt or a pair of my pants would go missing. Every time I went to the basement to do a load of laundry, I’d swear I turned the lights off, but then I’d look downstairs later that night and all the lights would be on.

Then, right as all the little problems to finally be gone, an even bigger problem appeared. After a big storm, I woke up Friday morning to find a big puddle of water on my kitchen floor. Rain had dripped through the roof and made its way right through the kitchen ceiling.

Seeing all the water damage made me feel sick. I imagined mold spreading through all the wood and drywall in the house, Leela breathing all the mold particles into her tiny lungs. I called every roofer in Madison until I finally got someone to come over right away and look at the damage.

“I can fix your roof,” the roofer said. “And your kitchen ceiling, too. But it’s going to cost a few thousand.”

I could have paid a few hundred, maybe, but not a few thousand. I told the roofer I’d think about it, but I couldn’t pay. I didn’t know what to do.

Friday night, I couldn’t sleep. I just lay in bed, imagining the mold spreading through the house, rotting the wood until the house finally collapsed in on itself.

Around two am, I was finally drifting off when I heard what sounded like someone banging a hammer on my roof.

I ran outside. The moon was shining. I could see the roof clearly. There was nobody up there. No people, no animals. Strange, I thought.

Even stranger, on Sunday it rained again, and nothing happened. I stood in the kitchen with a bucket, nervously waiting for the water to start dripping through the ceiling again, but it never did. I crawled up to the attic with a flashlight and shone the light over the underside of the roof. Somehow, the roof wasn’t leaking anymore. I noticed a step ladder right above the kitchen ceiling where the water had gotten through two days before. I swore the attic was empty when the house inspector went up there. But I told myself the step ladder must have always been there.

I got my laptop and looked through the report the inspector had sent me. I found the pictures of my attic, and I was right. The ladder wasn’t there. How did it get there?

I called the police.

“You’re saying that somebody is breaking into your house and fixing things?” the officer asked.

“Well, I didn’t fix the leak myself,” I said.

“And you’re sure the roof was leaking?”

“Look at this big water stain.”

I pointed at the big brown stain on the ceiling. I explained that I didn’t know anybody—family or friend—who would have come by to fix the roof for me. But the officer didn’t believe me. He talked to some neighbors, and they hadn’t seen anybody coming in or out of my house either, and so he went on his way.

I bought a security camera and put it over my front door. For the next few weeks, I checked the camera footage every day after work, trying to figure out if anybody was stalking me. The people I saw in the footage were all neighbors, though. Nobody seemed out of place.

I started to relax again. I know it sounds dumb now, but I told myself that maybe the roof wasn’t leaking. It was just a really bad storm that somehow caused water to get under the shingles that one time. I was losing my mind from all the unfinished renovation stress and making little problems worse than they actually were.

As soon as I started to relax again, though, another problem appeared. The thermostat went crazy. The temperature in the house shot up to 104 degrees. No matter how many times I lowered it back to 72, the temperature climbed back up to 104.

I called an electrician to look at the thermostat but, just like the roofer, he wanted more money to fix it than I could pay. So, I decided Leela and I would just have to live with the heat. We slept on top of our sheets, sweating through the night.

Then on our third night trying to sleep in that horrible heat, I woke up to Leela screaming. “There’s someone in the living room!”

I ran into the hallway. Leela stood next to the kitchen, looking toward the basement stairs. I grabbed her arm, carried her into the bathroom, locked the door and called the police. Two police officers arrived fifteen minutes later.

“Where did you see this man?” one of the officers asked.

Leela pointed at the thermostat. “He was right there. He wasn’t wearing any clothes.”

On the floor in front of the thermometer, I noticed a rusted screwdriver. The number on the thermometer was back at 72. The thermometer was working again.

The police officers searched all through the house, but they didn’t find anyone. The doors and windows were still locked. They checked my camera, but nobody had gone anywhere near the front door or my front lawn. There was just the thermostat, somehow fixed, and then that screwdriver.

“Maybe this house is haunted,” I told Janine, the next morning while we drank our coffee.

“At least you have helpful ghosts,” she said. “Ones that want to fix things. I wish I had ghosts like those.” She leaned closer to me. “You’re sure someone isn’t stalking you?”

“I’m a paranoid person. I’d notice if someone was following me around.”

“Someone from work maybe?”

“I see the same four people every day, and they all seem normal.”

“Just be careful.”

Leela and I were both pretty shaken by what had happened. As frightening as the whole experience was, though, it was great to have the house back to a normal temperature again. The next few nights, I slept in Leela’s bed with her, until she felt safe again. After she started normally again, I went back to my old bed, but unlike Leela, I couldn’t sleep. All night, I just lay awake, listening to the sounds in the house. The pipes contracting. The house’s walls, moaning. The overgrown tree branches rattling against the windows.

A few more months passed. October to November and into December. The temperature dropped to ten degrees Fahrenheit and then one of the worst things that could have happened in that house happened. In the dead of winter, January 10, the oil furnace went dead. The house couldn’t heat itself anymore.

I bought a few electric heaters from Walmart and put them in every room in the house but, still, I was worried Leela and I were going to freeze to death while we were sleeping.

I called about thirty furnace repair companies, but they all told me the same thing. It would cost at least twenty grand to fix it. I had no idea when I’d be able to get that much money saved. Ten years? Twenty years?

“Could I pay in installments?” I asked them.

But they all told me the same thing. Cash or cheque.

I called my parents in Chicago. I hate asking them for money, but I didn’t know what else to do.

“I’ll pay you back as soon as I can,” I promised them.

Mom and Dad said they’d see what they could do. I knew they’d probably be taking out a loan for it. I would have done that myself if my credit wasn’t wrecked. I felt horrible. Embarrassed and dumb.

The next night, I lay in bed, regretting every decision I’d made, feeling like my whole life was falling apart, when I heard a loud bang in the basement. It didn’t sound like pipes contracting. It sounded like someone banging metal against metal.

I sat up, my heart racing.

Maybe it is just the pipes, I told myself. Maybe they’ve frozen so bad they’ve started to crack.

Then I heard the sound again.

I got out of bed and put on my slippers. I picked up my phone, turned on the flashlight, and went into the hall. I checked on Leela first. She was sleeping in her bed.

The sound rang out again.

Clang! Clang!

It was coming from the basement—from the furnace room. I tiptoed downstairs. The furnace room lights were on. Leela and I were never down there. Why were those lights always on?

“I’ve called the police,” I shouted. “I have them on the phone with me. Whoever you are, you better leave now.”

I’d never thought I’d be so hopeful to see burst water pipes.

I poked my head into the furnace room, praying I’d see water everywhere. I didn’t see any water, though. The pipes were fine.

A decrepit-looking old man knelt next to the furnace, holding a rusted wrench. He wore nothing but filthy underwear. His skin was caked with dirt. The ends of his fingers were bloodied. He looked at me, smiling. His lips parted over his stained yellow teeth.

“Sorry if I woke you, Samantha” he said. “I’m just trying to get this furnace up and running again. It’s so cold outside. If I don’t get this fixed soon, all these pipes are going to freeze and burst.”

He knew my name. How the hell did he know my name?

I wanted to run, but I couldn’t. I was frozen. Too terrified to move.

He stood, his hammer in his hand, and walked toward me.

“Who are you?” I managed to ask him.

“My names’ Rupert. This is my house. It’s been so lonely here since Martha died. It’s so good having other people around the house again.”

Still smiling, he took another step forward.

“I thought I’d die here alone,” he said. “When you and your daughter moved in, though, I was so happy. I noticed you struggling, though. It must be hard on your own with no man in the house to take care of you. This is an old house. There’re so many problems. You really need a man around to help.”

He took another few steps forward. Now, he was close enough to me that he could hit me with his hammer now. That’s all I could picture. His hammer coming down on my head.

“What do you want?” I stuttered.

“I want you and your daughter to enjoy this house as much as I have,” he said. “I want you to be happy here.”

I thought of Leela sleeping upstairs, and I finally snapped myself out of it. I screamed as loud as I could and then ran upstairs, woke up Leela, rushed her out of the house, and called the police.

The neighbors’ lights lit up, one after the other. Janine came outside to find out what was going on. Before I knew it, the whole street was filled with police cars.

It turned out that the old owner, Rupert, never left the house after his wife died.  When the bank started sending him letters about missed mortgage payments, he moved his mattress underneath the basement stairs. Made himself a little bedroom and closed it off with some drywall. He was able to sneak out of the room by squeezing behind the drywall, eventually coming out into the dry storage room. The cops searched his room and told me they’d found all my missing clothes, along with a few half-eaten mice carcasses and some bottles of piss.

I sold the house as soon as I could find a buyer. Then Leela and I moved in with my parents in Chicago.

If I learned anything from this experience, it’s that I’m never going to buy a fixer-up again. I don’t care how good of a deal the house is. No price is worth the headache.",1,1750516566.0,Creepystories,1,1.0,False

What does that make you..,"Did you ever grow up self-conscious, wondering and worrying about what others thought? Being the subject of gossip and snark among your peers? Being judged and imperfect despite your struggles to be perfect? Grow up good-looking and then wonder, what can I get for myself with my looks? With my manipulations?

That’s Ashley Petrone, and we are watching her character evolution on social media. 

What would it be like to be her? Ever try to get into what she’s thinking when she does what she does?

Ashley Petrone has a Cult of Celebrity. She’s like the desperate Tara Reid married to Dino Petrone, who is Joe Francis, the Girls Gone Wild porn king.

Before the trailer, before the bungalow, before the Black House, before she let everything get to her head and became obsessed with herself and massive ego, Ashley was just like everybody else, getting by on discount designer goods.

Now, as a celebrity, she’s gunning for more deals, chomping at the bit to be sponsored, greedy and desperate for the attention to be someone whom she looks to as having “made it” - trying to use her 800K empty social media clout to get luxury companies to treat her like Paris Hilton. Some how, she’s made herself into someone that 1,556 Snarkers hate, and some other non-zero number of sheep that buy Foxi Coffee or Made-in-Tarrifslanda Jerkantile overpriced shit.  

Her positive-commenting followers are her enablers, and she’s the classically manic Bitch to people who don’t give her what she wants. This is the reality that all Snarkers see in her reels - a woman who is so deeply flawed in so many ways, and worse, completely unwilling to own her choices and change for the better in any societally responsible way. 

She’s locked herself into a mental mansion that we get to watch the chaos she creates, and her family stands guard, ever defending her like their queen. There’s no real belief system, just pure materialism, capitalism, and marketing with words God, Lord, and Him thrown in.

There’s no living with grace and humbledness in Ashley’s era of social media reliance. And this is the Petrone Way. And some times you need a break from that fucking disgusting face of hers and imagining Dino’s hyena-like squeal during their sexcapades. 

And in This Season Of Ashley’s Simple Life, we’ll watch the overcaffeinated Ashley Petrone try to convert from suburban pretend minimalistic materialist to horror show homesteader who’s in it for the followers and not because she’s humbled.

Ashley Petrone isn’t someone who can rope a cow, she’s just there to take selfies with her cute lil’ $799 cowgirl boots. 

Sorry, Tennessee! 🤡🤡🤡🍿🍿🍿

1lgxuft,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgxuft,Balmy Morning Smoke,"Did a little yard work before it gets too hot and now to enjoy a new stick

This morning I am smoking a CI Knock Offs Coffee Cigar I got on CigarBid and a crazy low price of $1.60 a cigar. That then sat in my Tupperdor for a week 

This is my first time trying the CI Knockoffs line and Coffee in particularly.

Slightly off topic:
I am a Huge fan of almost anything Drew Estates especially their discontinued line of Natural which then became Larutan and now is the Factory Smokes Sweets.

The Factory Smokes Sweets are a drop from the Naturals I used to love yet have became an everyday smoke that my wife will sometimes join me in enjoying.

Back to today’s stick


CI Knockoffs Coffee:
No band, Toro, the wrapper is a 
Maduro and the origin Nicaragua

The wrapper is … rustic with veins being semi prominent but is way better than some Fumas I have seen.

Before lighting this stick has a very aromatic smell off cocoa and coffee that I enjoy.

It has a nice solid construction but is not super stiff or too tight

Burn: It has a slightly wavy burn but is not too uneven and throughout it hasn’t gotten to hot, I am not having to keep the torch at hand for uneven burning that I have seen with more expensive sticks. I did not have to relight the stick once it was started.

1st third Flavor: the cap has a very slight sweet flavor that I know my wife will enjoy lighting one up with me, upon lighting my first draw is smooth and a nice coffee cream, wood flavor and maybe a very very slight hint at pepper…… I’m not a big pepper fan but seem to be tasting it in everything lately so it could just be me

2nd third Flavor: the burn is still even with a slight wave, the flavor has kicked up to more of an expresso and I can definitely taste cocoa, wood, and possibly cedar but that last may be me as I haven’t heard that from anywhere else.

3rd third: the flavor keeps nice and consistent coffe, cocoa, cedar and I can definitely taste the pepper throughout. The cap still has the slightly sweet taste and I have found myself unconsciously biting into the last bit of the stick.

Down to the nub and I find myself wanting to finish the whole stick, I am able to hold it with my fingers and it’s not too hot as other sticks have been.

Ash:  just as I was thinking I would get a nice solid long ash and was gonna get a pic Boom it dropped just at an inch and each drop has been consistent right at an inch or maybe a smidge more.

Overall: this may become a daily smoke as it was pleasant, smooth with a nice creamy coffee taste with a hint of pepper that really hit the spot, I did not have to relight once it was going and just kept a nice even spin on it as I would smoke.

For $1.60 a stick this is definitely one I will be adding to my routinely smoked,  I usually prefer a stronger like the Diesel Shorty, CAO Mx2, Cuba Libre One “the Brute”

Timeless. Daring. American soul with European polish.

It’s not just music—it’s a conversation:
🎷 between the street and the symphony,
🎼 the blues and the ballroom.

If Ravel and Ellington had a jam over coffee and cigarettes in a smoky Paris salon—this would be the soundtrack.

It brought me back to 1994—Year 11 at the Con High—when I performed this masterpiece at the Mayorals Ball at Sutherland Shire Civic Centre as a Young Achiever of the Year for contributions to music. I was 17, all nerves and adrenaline.

If you need to remember why you fell in love with music—this is the moment.
Give it a spin. Your heart will thank you.

Okay, Reddit, I've been a digital nomad for years, bouncing between coffee shops and co-working spaces. My back?  Let's just say it's seen better days.  I've tried everything – those inflatable lumbar supports, the balance ball chair (don't even get me started), even those fancy ergonomic cushions. Nothing really solved the problem long-term. I was starting to think I needed a serious intervention, maybe even a chiropractor.

Then, a friend recommended a gaming chair.  I was skeptical, I'll admit.  I pictured myself sinking into a brightly colored, plastic monstrosity.  But this one is different. The 21.25-inch wide cushion is what sold me. I'm a pretty big guy, and most chairs feel cramped.  This one?  I can actually stretch out. It's like a personalized hug for my back.

I spend hours every day working on my laptop, and this chair has been a lifesaver.  The ergonomic design is fantastic. I used to slouch constantly, but now I find myself sitting up straighter without even trying. It's subtle, but it's made a huge difference. I feel more alert and focused, too.  I used to need a break every hour, just to stretch and walk around. Now, I can easily go three or four hours without even feeling stiff. That's extra time I can spend on my projects, without the nagging back pain.

I did my research, of course. I read tons of reviews and compared specs. I looked at chairs from every price range. What convinced me was the combination of the wide cushion and the overall build quality. It feels solid and well-made.  I have a feeling this chair will last me for years.

One unexpected benefit? My confidence has actually improved.  Sounds weird, I know, but sitting comfortably in a supportive chair makes me feel more put-together. I feel more ready to tackle whatever the day throws at me, whether it's a big presentation or a tough deadline. It's a small thing, but it's made a real difference in my mood and outlook.  I'm more productive, and that's a win-win.

The adjustable features are great, too. You can adjust the height, armrests, and lumbar support to find the perfect fit. Assembly was a breeze; it took about 15 minutes, and the instructions were clear. No missing parts or wrestling with confusing screws—a huge plus!  I was even able to set it up in my tiny apartment without any issues.

If you're looking for a new chair, especially if you spend a lot of time sitting, check this one out.  I found mine on ursupermart.com, but I'm sure you can find it other places too.  It's seriously improved my work life. The comfort is amazing, and the ergonomic design is a lifesaver. I've found myself feeling more relaxed and less stressed overall.  Plus, the increased productivity is a welcome side effect.  No more fidgeting and shifting around because of an uncomfortable chair!

I've been using this chair for a couple of months now, and I can honestly say it's been a great investment.  I can finally work for hours without that constant back pain.  It's a great investment for anyone who spends a lot of time sitting. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an ergonomic chair with superior comfort. It’s really helped me focus better, too, which is a huge win.  I'm much more productive now. It's made a noticeable difference in my daily life. I'm so much more comfortable and relaxed.  This is a chair I'd recommend to anyone who values comfort and wants to improve their posture.  It’s helped me feel more confident and put-together, too.  It’s a small thing, but it makes a big difference.

I'm genuinely curious to hear your experiences if you decide to get one. Let me know what you think! Maybe we can even start a comfy chair support group! 😂

Here’s the link if you’re curious: https://go.ursupermart.com/y9kPeU


I also wanted to add that the materials are really high-quality.  It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy at all.  The stitching is solid, and the overall construction feels very durable.  I'm confident this chair will last me for many years to come.  And that's important to me because I'm not a fan of constantly replacing furniture.  This chair feels like a worthwhile investment.  It's also surprisingly stylish, which is a bonus. It doesn't look out of place in my apartment, which is important to me.

Another thing I appreciate is how easy it was to adjust the chair to my specific needs.  The height adjustment is smooth, and the armrests move easily.  I was able to find the perfect position in just a few minutes.  This is something I really struggled with in my old chair.  I was constantly fiddling with it, trying to get comfortable.  This chair has eliminated that frustration entirely.  It's just so easy to adjust and get into the perfect position.

I've also noticed that my overall mood has improved since I started using this chair.  I feel less stressed and more relaxed.  I think this is partly due to the improved posture, but also because I'm just more comfortable overall.  I'm not constantly shifting around or fidgeting, which was a common occurrence with my old chair.  This has made a significant difference in my overall well-being.

So, yeah, if you're in the market for a new chair, especially a high-performance gaming chair with a wide cushion, I highly recommend checking this one out.  It's been a game changer for me, and I think it could be for you too.

I’d love to find some cool people to chat and connect with. If you’re interested, send me a message with a bit about you and where you’re from. ",3,1750515405.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1lgxlmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1lgxlmp/day_three_and_ive_quit/,Day Three and I’ve Quit!,"So, I‘ve been trying to quit caffeine for years. In the past I might have gone down to a “safe“ level of below 200 mg (I have anxiety), but it always crept back up and I knew I needed to kick it for good. I’m on day 3 without caffeine and only had some light headaches, fatigue, and body aches. I‘m through the worst of it noe, and since I’ve found reading other people’s experiences helpful, I want to share what works for me. 

* Tapering slow, then fast. It took me 26 days to quit. The first week was the worst. I just guessed my starting point at 350-400 mg but might have underestimated. Took a week to get down to 250, at which point I felt awful. Not helped by food poisoning. Read about electrolytes and decided to let myself have more salt while I was quitting, in addition to about 125 mg of magnesium and, since I can’t do dairy, 600 mg of calcium.
* Changed mindset by reading Allen Carr’s book on how to quit caffeine, often recommended here, then decided to fast taper. Went from 200 mg to 0 mg in 6 days.
* Realized I was using caffeine as permission to rest while maintaining the illusion that I was going to be productive later, even though it has been a long time since caffeine made me more productive. 
* Fruit juice—I need something to look forward to in the morning and get my digestion moving.
* Using the calmer energy to do things that caffeine makes hard, like yoga, meditation, writing, reading, etc.
* Gentle exercise like walking and beginner strength classes.
* Moved exercise sessions to evening. Had been using coffee to get them in before lunch, but evenings work better with my circadian rhythm.
* NOT switching to tea. By far the worst day I had was when I tried to do this. I might be intolerant as this works for others.
* Getting rid of strength, not quantity.
* Lots of water and herbal tea.
* Keeping everything else in my life pretty much the same.

I was SO scared of withdrawal since I’ve experienced pretty bad effects in the past, and am impressed at how well this has worked for me! Good luck to those of you who are trying to figure your own needs out!",12,1750515403.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

She has known them for 4 weeks and it is a couple, we went out to eat last night and I was under the impression we were only going out to eat but then alcohol was mentioned, she said she was going to partake because she was off tomorrow, I am not so I suggested we leave and she suggested I just take our car home because his girlfriend could take her home as she'd be tbe designated driver. Her intention was to drink a lot. She never told me that the girlfriend was under 21 so they got kicked out of the bar part of the restaurant only for her to message me that she is at their apartment and showed the alcohol on the coffee table. He then messaged me at 12:40am showing a photo of her passed out in a sweater that isn't her's. I demanded the address and went down there despite him saying he'd take her own after he sobered up and that she was wearing the sweater because she was physically hot while drunk. I got there and she was wearing his sweater, no pants on, I assume without a bra because most of her clothes were in a plastic bag that he gave me, while his shirt was off and shorts were on. She was uninterested in talking to me and locked herself in the bathroom from 1:30-3am. I woke up at 3 (i go to work at 5) and she didn't seem to want to talk about and tried to convince me that nothing happened but there'd be no way she would know due to being blacked out from 10:42pm-12:40am from when she sent the photo of the bottles, to when he sent me a text about her being passed out with diffrent clothes on.

1lgxk9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1lgxk9w/should_i_spend_my_saturday_exploring_a_hidden/,Should I spend my Saturday exploring a hidden trail or finally tackle that spring-cleaning?,"Hey r/makemychoice,

I’m torn between two totally different but equally appealing ways to spend my Saturday, and I need your honest input.

Option one: wake up early, grab a coffee, and drive out to this lesser-known trail I’ve heard about. It’s supposed to have beautiful views, wildlife, and a peaceful vibe perfect for an afternoon of solitude and nature photography.

Option two: finally face the messy tasks at home decluttering the garage, sorting old boxes, and deep-cleaning the living room. It’s the kind of satisfaction you only get when everything’s organized and fresh.

I keep picturing both:

* The trail gives adventure, fresh air, and a great mental reset but it’s a bit of a drive and solo hiking isn’t as easy as it used to be.
* Staying home means checking off chores that have been hanging over me for months and enjoying a spotless space but nothing beats the feeling of escaping into the outdoors.

So I’m wondering what would *you* choose?

Share your experiences:

* Has taking a day off-grid recharged your batteries more than crossing off a to-do list?
* Or does finishing chores and enjoying a clean space leave you sleeping like a baby?

If you had to pick one of these for a weekend “self-care boost,” which one tips the scales and why?

Let’s settle this—I need your real-talk advice!",1,1750515304.0,makemychoice,3,0.6,False

[Posted the day after](https://amicoage.neocities.org/509), it's loaded with claims and promises!

1. Tom says they extended the ""VIP preorders"" because **""A bunch of people have asked us to please extend to Friday because that is when they are getting paid.""** So we can add ""exploiting people who live paycheck to paycheck"" to the extensive list of Intellivision/Amico/Happy Home sins. 

2. Tom says the have another **""exclusive VIP Pre-Order program going on with a 3rd party partner (not a retailer)""** then immediately says there's **""ZERO difference from what folks can already do directly through us.""** His messaging was often like this, he often contradicted himself within the same paragraph. 

3. Tom says retail preorders start next month. Perhaps they did, perhaps not. 

4. Tom says, **""That's the incredible thing about all of this.  The BIG retailers literally have tens of millions of people on their mailing list and those mailing list folks have no idea about Amico right now.""** It was so easy for him to see potential, but difficult for him to accept reality. 

5. Tom says, **""We're confident that we can get that pre-orders up to probably 50,000 or so before we've ever spent a dime on advertising or started any of our real family marketing, etc.  Excitement with all of our partners is off the charts!""** There has been zero evidence that preorders went higher than the \~6,000 units described in their SEC filings. 

6. Tom says, **""Big press release coming at the end of the month in regards to some of our licensing partnerships (with a LOT of mic drop moments)""** which I suppose happened, but I'm not sure if they were mic drop moments for most people. 

7. Tom says stuff about Cara Acker, formerly of Mattel, who stayed with them long enough for them to drag her name thru the mud in some promo spots before going back to her real job.

8. Tom says they were working on putting a whole level of the Moon Patrol demo on mobile. They did this, in addition to removing a bunch of gimmicky ""augmented reality"" features they hadn't thought all the way through. 

It was so nice of Tom to put his diary online!
