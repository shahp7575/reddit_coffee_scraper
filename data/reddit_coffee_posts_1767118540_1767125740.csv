Earlier this year, I moved to the UK with him.

His ex (25F) is also from the UK and they were together for almost 2 years as well, according to him the relationship ended up being very messy and toxic that lead to the end of that relationship.

To my knowledge, she is now with someone else and has a child with them.

When we were in Canada I was aware that she occasionally messaged him, particularly about the cat that they adopted when they were together (the cat is now with the ex), he was very upfront about the messages and always allowed me to check the messages to ease my mind if I had any concerns.

However, after we have moved to the UK, I have noticed that the messages started to increase, and the conversations started to shift away from the cat and into more personal problems. I raised this as a concern to him and expressed that I felt uncomfortable with this level of contact, he reassured me that he tries to maintain minimal comments and never reaches out first.

Recently I found out that he met her for coffee without my knowledge at the beginning of the month, I once again expressed my concern and discomfort about this, and expressed that I felt that my boundaries were disrespected especially since I have previously expressed concerns already. He assured me that it was only a cup of coffee for her to vent (since according to him, it seems like she doesn't have any other people she trusts), nothing happened, and that they will cut contact.

Am not proud in saying that I snooped through the messages mvself and discovered that they still have contact. with hersending him selfies and photos of her kid in most of the messages. He reassured that he is fading out the conversations and is upset by the fact that I am still upset about this after multiple conversation.

He has been upfront about most of their conversations and have only replied with minimal reactions to her text. I trust him and knows that he will never do anything to hurt me, but I still feel like he is not being firm enough with cutting contact, but understand that it is not my place to force him to do anything.

Am I wrong in bringing it up and being upset by the situation ?",2,1767125317.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

\*\*\*

Jontin had always loved art, even when he stopped. He loved it ever since his older sister bought him a coloring book as a toddler. When he thought of art, he thought back to that time. He thought of her. Life was something to be captured, he decided, was better preserved on paper. He drew, sketched, painted, took pictures of the simplest things–captured what people wouldn’t care to look at, even if he didn't have the utensils in hand. 

It was a shame when she had gone. Some say she ran away. Others say she went missing. But mother was worried. Ma would be in so much emotional pain praying she never yelled at Jyra that last time. Jontin remembered Ma and her would fight and Ma saying “That living person has a dead spirit, an evil spirit. Just draining your life away.” With Jyra crying, with anger on her face, running away. Maybe she would’ve accepted her boyfriend and she would’ve stayed. He remembered her cries, “My baby, Jyra!” while looking at her pictures of her as an infant. When Jontin had stopped art, he figured he’d pick it up again at a later date. If he ever felt the strength to. And that’s what brought him to the art museum today.

He would always come to the art museum as a kid to show his art to Mr. Miller, the museum curator. And he would buy things from him at his gift shop. Today, he returned after ten years from moving to a new town and wandered into the little gift shop inside the art museum to meet with Mr. Miller. He would come here for peace of mind when mother would argue with his sister and after she’d gone. Now, whenever he arrived, he would meet him with the same open smile that said along the lines of “Hey Mr. Miller, got anything new here for me?” Mr. Miller would return with a “Mr. Jontin, nice to see you, I may have something today. You just have to find out”. Mr. Miller would today return with an old vintage art photo that was once lost but is now found of a redheaded girl with an intriguing presence and something mysterious in hand. Jontin bought it without hesitation, as though it was something he’d been looking for for ages.

At home, he sat it against the wall on his desk. He took another gaze at it. And began to draw.

For days, Jontin couldn’t stop drawing. He drew and drew. Sketched and sketched. Painted and painted. Redoing the process if he needed to. Not until he got it right. 

Something about this artpiece he wanted to figure out. Each scanning, each gaze he made he’d tried to find meaning of what it meant. He tried to figure out what was in her hand. And why was she holding it? What was the meaning of her red hair? It felt like he couldn’t make ends meet. One minute, he noticed something, next minute he didn’t. So he thought maybe he didn’t. *Maybe I missed something.* 

Then nights passed. And one night, in one dream, he heard a woman’s voice whisper, *“Jontin.”* Jontin is shaken but cannot gather more information. When he wakes up, there is nothing. He goes back to sleep. And when he wakes up again, it is morning. He is preparing to make breakfast in his apartment. Drinking coffee when the phone rings. He receives the phone call to come to the museum with the art photo. He returns to the art museum the next day, hoping to find answers, but the museum has shut down, with caution tapes and signs and the looks of the beginning process of new construction. Only the art remains in his possession, leaving him uncertain whether the girl ever truly existed. 

Despite the ambiguity, Jontin is looking for the curator, but he isn’t let in until she arrives. 

Then the curator uses an AI capture on it, he finds out the art isn’t vintage and that it is a modern reinterpretation when the girl shows up, revealing to be his sister Jyra looking like a different person, but like the one in art. And shows him the original art, which is how he remembers but with a coloring book in hand. She begins to say, “Jontin–” But before she could finish, his shock led him to embrace her with a hug and she did the same. 

This is more drama and mystery but here is my story to share with you all.

When she finally did explain, she explained that she came up with the photo with the art curator to eventually tell him that she had left because she needed to find her purpose in life, something different. Her and mother were having problems because she wanted to help people find their purpose in ways she didn’t get to as a kid. To escape the stifles of her past and met a new desire. Her boyfriend and the longing to build a family before she can no longer. She explained she had secondary infertility but she was pregnant prior to leaving home a decade ago. And her purpose, her desire now to help others persevere against any obstacles the way she did trying to escape an abusive boyfriend and herself. She explained that she was kidnapped and ran away. She ran away with her boyfriend just to go missing. What she now called, “a living person with an evil spirit that drained her life”, the way her mother once said. And she also returned as a surprise. A little girl with fiery red hair comes in the distance, which looks like braids that have been dyed. The little girl goes up to him with what looks to be reaching out with one hand before the other for a hug but she gives him what Jyra would have wanted. And that is the artpiece–the photo– and the photo turns out to be of her holding a mysterious book that would represent the past when he first received his coloring book from her. His love for art no matter how old or how new.

After the three of them, Jontin, Jyra, and Mr. Miller leave the building, with the construction workers preparing to tear it down. A sudden smoke in the air. 

Jontin has now learned that even the things lost can be found and returned, but especially people. And that you can find things in things that are new. A sense of being at peace comes with knowing that he has found clarity and a new clarity. A new purpose. To persevere.

Turmeric Latte smells like walking into a cozy café on a cold evening. 

It opens with warm, creamy vanilla and a gentle spice! Soft, cozy, and slightly sweet. The turmeric and tonka bean give it this comforting, milky warmth.

This isn’t a sharp or “perfumey” scent at all. It’s intimate and snuggly.

Perfect for fall and winter, bedtime vibes, blankets, tea/coffee, and hibernation.

But thanks to tools like **Nano Banana image generation**, turning abstract thoughts into vivid visuals has become easier and more exciting than ever. Whether you're crafting content for fun, personal projects, or brainstorming for something bigger, the process has become more intuitive, faster, and way more fun.

One of the best things about using Nano Banana is how beginner-friendly it is. You don’t need to be a tech wizard or have a background in AI. The interface is clean, and the workflow feels natural.

It’s kind of like magic: you think it, and Nano Banana turns it into something you can see.

Another great aspect is how it helps you iterate. Maybe your first image isn't exactly what you wanted, but tweaking the prompt and refining your idea becomes a part of the fun. The instant feedback lets you explore variations quickly without having to start from scratch every time. It’s especially helpful for people who think visually but don’t necessarily have drawing or digital art skills.

Let’s not forget the creative freedom it opens up. You can play with ideas you wouldn’t normally explore. Want to see what a futuristic jungle might look like on Mars? Go for it. Wondering how a coffee cup would look designed by a jellyfish? Nano Banana doesn’t judge—it delivers. That freedom gives you room to brainstorm wildly, and who knows what kind of inspiration will hit you along the way?

In terms of functionality, **Nano Banana image generation** works seamlessly with platforms like AICC, where users get access to streamlined AI tools and creative environments. AICC’s integration offers a broader canvas for experimenting, sharing, and refining AI-generated visuals, making it ideal for students, creators, and innovators alike.

Overall, Nano Banana helps bridge the gap between imagination and imagery. It’s fast, fun, and makes AI creativity feel personal. No need for expensive software or complex tools—just your idea, and a few seconds later, your vision starts to take form.

Lila Brennan married a man who couldn't stand to be touched—Evan Cross.
Three years, three rules: No touching. No kissing. No sex.
She learned the hard way.
Once, she drank from his water glass by mistake.
He picked it up with two fingers and dropped it straight into the trash.
Another time, she ran a fever—103 and climbing.
When she finally came to, she asked him to hold her.
He stayed in the doorway instead. ""Lila. Don't.""
Lila didn't argue or cry. She just became more careful.
She thought if she was patient enough, he'd eventually let her in.
But then they went to the lake.
Both she and Simone—Evan's widowed sister-in-law—fell into the water.
Evan dove in without hesitation.
Pulled Simone out first. Wrapped his jacket around her. Held her steady while she caught her breath.
And that's when Lila finally understood.
Evan didn't have a germ problem.
He had a problem with HER.
She pulled out her phone. Opened a message she'd been ignoring for years.
[Lila. 9,999th time asking. When are you leaving him and marrying me?]
Through blurred vision, she typed back:
[Thirty days. Come find me.]
If Evan couldn't love her? Fine.
She'd marry the one man he hated most. The man who'd been asking for four years straight.
...
It happened on the way back from the cemetery.
The car got hit. Spun out. Both of Simone and Lila went into the river.
Lila couldn't swim. She thrashed. Swallowed water. Mud. Panic.
Through the blur, she saw Evan dive in.
She reached for him. ""Evan—help—""
Then Simone's voice cut through. ""Evan—please—""
He hesitated. Just for a second.
Then he swam straight past Lila.
""Simone can't swim. Hold on, Lila. I'll come back.""
Lila's chest went tight. Cold. Like someone had shoved ice through her ribs.
She grabbed for his sleeve. Missed.
He shoved her hand away.
And she sank.
...
Lila had met Evan during a bank robbery.
He had been wearing a black suit. Calm. Untouchable. While everyone else was screaming, he just stood there.
When the robber grabbed him, Evan didn't flinch. Gave the cops a look. Let them take the shot.
Everyone else had flinched when the gun went off.
Not him.
Lila couldn't stop staring.
She begged her dad to introduce them.
He saw right through her. ""Anyone but him, Lila. He's got issues. Dozens of women have tried. None of them lasted.""
""I'm different.""
She'd been so sure of herself back then. Bright. Confident. Relentless.
She'd learned he liked this specific baklava from a place in Brooklyn. Drove two hours just to bring him a box.
When he got sick on a business trip, she chartered a plane. Showed up at his hotel. Took care of him for three days.
The worst was when he got trapped in a mudslide at a construction site. Everyone told her to wait for the crew.
She dug him out with her bare hands.
After that, he proposed.
""I need someone to marry. For the family.""
No ring. No love.
She'd said yes anyway. Asked if he'd finally fallen for her.
He'd brushed her hand off his arm. ""Yeah.""
She'd been too happy to notice the disgust in his eyes.
Too blind to realize—he'd proposed the same day Simone married his older brother, Jace.
Evan had never loved her.
She'd just been the consolation prize.
...
A bodyguard pulled her out of the water.
Evan didn't even look at her.
He was holding Simone. Whispering to her. ""You're okay. I've got you.""
His suit was soaked. Mud in his hair. Filth all over him.
And he didn't care.
All he cared about was her.
He looked at Simone the way he'd never looked at Lila.
Lila stood there shivering. Arms wrapped around herself. Tears streaming down her face.
She'd believed him. Believed he couldn't stand to be touched.
Four years. Over a thousand days. She'd followed every rule.
But it wasn't real.
The rules were only for her.
For Simone, there were none.
...
Simone clutched her chest. ""My necklace. Evan, the necklace you gave me—it's gone.""
Evan didn't hesitate. Dove back into the water.
Came up empty. Dove again. And again.
Finally surfaced with it. Handed it to her like he'd just won her a prize.
""Don't cry. I found it.""
Lila laughed. A bitter, broken sound.
She pulled out her phone. Opened a message she'd been ignoring for years.
[Lila. 9,999th time asking. When are you leaving him and marrying me?]
Through blurred vision, she typed back:
[Thirty days. Come find me.]

Rhys Callahan.

Chapter 2
Lila and Simone were both taken to the hospital.
The second Evan walked into those sterile hallways, she saw it—that flicker of disgust.
He'd always hated hospitals. Hated the smell, the fluorescent lights, the way everything felt contaminated.
But then he looked at Simone, and whatever discomfort he felt, he swallowed it. Stayed right there beside her the entire time.
Lila stood across the hall watching them. Felt like someone took a knife to her chest and just kept digging.
It hadn't always been this cold.
There were small moments.
Times when Evan would bring her gelato from that overpriced place on Melrose she loved after late dinners. When she was upset, he'd pat her head—through gloves, yeah, but still. It was something.
But last winter when she got the flu—fever so high she was hallucinating—she'd begged him to visit her at the hospital.
He'd said, ""Lila, you know I can't do hospitals. Don't ask me to.""
Yet here he was now. Standing in the place he'd always avoided. All because Simone needed him.
She'd heard once that love meant compromise. Bending yourself into shapes that hurt just to fit into someone's world.
That's what she'd done for Evan.
And what Evan did for Simone.
God, she was so stupid.
After leaving the hospital, Lila went straight to his office with the divorce papers.
""I want a divorce. Sign it.""
Evan's jaw tightened. ""Because I didn't pull you out first? Lila, Simone can't swim. I had to get her first.""
She let out this bitter laugh that didn't even sound like her. ""You think I can?""
He froze for a second. Then irritation flashed across his face. ""You're still here, aren't you? You're fine.""
That casual dismissal. Like she was being dramatic. Like almost drowning was just another Tuesday.
All the hope she'd been holding onto—all those years of trying—it just burned away. Nothing left but this hollow ache.
She was too tired to fight anymore. Just pointed at the signature line. ""Sign it.""
Evan didn't move. Voice went cold. ""Can you stop being dramatic?""
The door opened.
Simone walked in. When she saw the papers on the table, the faintest smile crossed her lips. So quick Lila almost missed it.
She handed Evan a cup of tea, then turned to Lila with that soft, sympathetic voice. ""Lila, he didn't mean it like that. Here—have some tea. I'm sorry this is happening.""
Sweet smile. Cold eyes.
Something inside Lila snapped.
She knocked the cup out of Simone's hand. ""Get away from me.""
Porcelain shattered. Tea everywhere.
Simone gasped, stumbled backward, hit the floor hard.
Evan's face changed instantly.
He pulled Simone up like she was made of glass, settled her onto the couch, hands hovering over her like he was afraid she'd break.
""Are you okay? Did she hurt you?""
Simone leaned into him. Voice trembling just right. ""I'm fine. I just wanted to help. I didn't think she'd—""
""It's not your fault."" Evan's hand hovered near her face, fingers twitching like he wanted to touch her but couldn't quite cross that line yet. His cold gaze snapped to Lila. ""You want a divorce? Fine. You got it.""
He signed the papers in one sharp motion. Tossed them at her. ""Hope you don't regret this.""
Regret?
The only thing Lila regretted was marrying him in the first place.
She turned to leave.
Behind her, Simone's voice drifted over. Soft. Careful. ""Evan... you actually signed it? What if she really goes through with it?""
Evan's response was cold. Almost amused. ""She won't. She loves me too much to leave. This is just her way of getting attention. Now let me see if you hurt your ankle.""
Lila stopped.
Turned around.
Under the dim office light, Evan knelt in front of Simone. Gently lifting her foot onto his lap. His expression soft. Focused.
Germophobe.
Right.
What a serious fucking case.

Chapter 3
The next morning, Lila filed for divorce.
When she got back, Evan was in the driveway with Simone. Teaching her to drive. His hand over hers on the wheel, heads bent close, talking low.
Lila stood there thinking about all those times she'd scrubbed her hands till they bled just to hold his hand for thirty seconds.
To Evan, she was contaminated. Simone was sacred.
Love always shows itself. Lila had just been too blind to see it.
She turned toward the house. Then—engine roar, tires screaming—
Next second, she was flying. Hit the pavement hard.
Glass everywhere. Pain like her whole body was on fire.
Through the cracked windshield, she saw Evan holding Simone. Face white. Hands shaking.
Simone's voice trembled. ""I'm okay—but Lila, she needs help—""
Evan glanced at Lila in the broken glass. Blood everywhere. His voice came out flat.
""No. Too much blood. It's filthy.""
A laugh escaped Lila's throat, twisted and ugly. Then the darkness swallowed her whole.
...
When she woke up, Evan was standing by the bed.
Reached out. Stopped. Pulled out gloves. One pair. Two. Three.
Something cracked in Lila's chest. ""If you can't stand me, just go.""
He pulled back. Handed her soup instead. ""Eat.""
Once, this would've meant everything. Now it just hurt.
She ate. Said nothing.
When she finished, Evan's face softened a fraction. ""Simone needs that beef broth you make. Can you do that?""
Right. Of course. That's what this was about.
He didn't come because she'd been hit by a car. He came because he needed her to cook for Simone.
Lila's hands curled into fists. ""She ran me over and you want me to make her soup?""
Something crossed his face, but he buried it fast. ""It was an accident. Doctor said you're fine. And it's just soup.""
Lila grabbed the water cup. Threw it at him. ""Get out!""
He stepped aside, yanked off his gloves, and took her hand in his—fingers intertwined like it was some grand gesture.
""There. Happy?""
Lila stared at him through tears.
What kind of man had she married?
Two of Evan's guys showed up later. Dragged her back to the house. Stood there while she made the damn broth.
When they finally brought her back to the hospital, she passed out before she hit the bed.
Didn't last long.
Sharp pain in her wrist woke her up.
Someone yanked her off the bed. Threw her to the floor.
Lila's back slammed into the hospital floor. Pain shot through her spine, cold sweat breaking across her forehead.
""Evan—what the he11—""
His face was stone. Eyes colder than she'd ever seen them. ""You want to play innocent? Fine. But dru//gging Simone's soup? You almost made her lose the baby.""
Lila tried to sit up. One of his guys grabbed her arms, twisted them behind her back, shoved her down. Cheek pressed against the cold tile.
She could barely breathe. ""Are you insane? Why would I—""
""She didn't eat anything today except what you made."" Evan's voice was flat. ""Stay down there till you admit what you did.""
Panic clawed at her heart. ""Evan, you can't do this to me!""

He turned to the bodyguards. ""Take her to the pool.""
She fought. Didn't matter. They dragged her outside, and then she hit the water—cold slamming into her like a wall, stealing the air from her lungs.
Chlorine seared her throat. She came up gasping, choking.
""Evan—""
He stood at the edge. Didn't move.
She tried to reach the side. Her arms felt like lead. Too heavy. Too tired.
Right when she thought she'd drown, they pulled her out. Threw her at his feet.
Water everywhere. Blood seeping through her bandages, pooling on the concrete.
Evan stepped back. ""Ready to admit it?""
Lila coughed till her ribs screamed. ""It wasn't me.""
They threw her back in.
Again. And again. And again.
Till she couldn't fight anymore. She stopped thrashing. Stopped reaching for the surface.
What was the point? Let it end here.
The blue tiles at the bottom got closer. Clearer.
Someone yanked her up one more time.
Through the ringing in her ears, she heard Evan on the phone.
""You're sure? It wasn't her?"" A pause. ""Alright.""
Her body gave out. Everything went black.
...
She woke up to pain.
Disinfectant smell. Lungs on fire. Every breath like broken glass.
""You're awake."" Evan's voice. ""Doctor said you have pneumonia. You'll be here a few days.""
Lila turned her head. He was sitting in the chair by the window. Still in that black suit. Still untouchable.
But something in his eyes was different. Guilt.
""We looked into it,"" he said quietly. ""Nurse mixed up the medication. It wasn't you."" He glanced at her. ""This one's on me. Whatever you want—compensation, apology—name it.""
Lila didn't look at him. Her voice came out flat. ""I don't want anything. Just leave.""
She got it now. He only cared about Simone. This apology wasn't for Lila—it was to keep her from making trouble.
Something crossed Evan's face. He looked like he wanted to say more.
But at the end, he just walked out.
...
For the next few days, Evan showed up every afternoon. Stayed half an hour.
Once, she would've counted every second. Now she just stared at the ceiling till he was gone.
Lila got out of the hospital on a Thursday.
That same night, her friend Maya texted about some party in Tribeca—said it'd be low-key, just drinks, nothing crazy.
Lila almost said no. Sitting alone in that apartment Evan paid for felt worse than dealing with people, so she went.
She didn't expect to run into Simone there.
The second Simone saw her, she smiled—not the fake-sweet one she used around Evan. Like she'd been waiting for this.
She walked over with two glasses of wine, moving slow, like she had all the time in the world. ""Lila."" Her voice was soft. ""I wanted to apologize. For last week. Evan gets protective, you know how he is."" She held out one of the glasses. ""This is me saying sorry. For both of us.""
Lila turned to leave.
Simone's hand shot out, grabbed her wrist, pulled her back. Leaned in close enough that no one else could hear.
""You look pathetic, you know that? Like a dog waiting for scraps. He's never going to love you.""
Something in Lila's heart went tight and hot. She shoved Simone back. 
"" You're sleeping with your dead husband's brother while pregnant with his kid and you're calling me pathetic?""
Simone's face changed instantly. Then she threw the wine in her own face, slapped herself across the cheek, and dropped to her knees.
""I'm sorry—Lila, I'm so sorry—I know I messed up before but I'm pregnant—please don't make me drink—""
Lila stood there, brain not catching up.
Before she could process what was happening, someone grabbed her from behind and threw her sideways.
She hit the coffee table. Glasses shattered. Something sharp went into her hand.
She saw the blood spreading before she felt it.
When she looked up, Evan was there—pulling Simone up, checking her face, her arms, making sure she was okay.
He didn't even glance at Lila.
""Have I been too easy on you?"" His voice was quiet. Scary-quiet. ""Is that what this is?""
Lila pushed herself up, her hand screaming.
Three years. Three years of wishing he'd touch her without looking like it hurt him.
And now he finally did—to hurt her.
""That's really what you think."" Her voice cracked. ""After everything.""
For a second, he almost looked like he believed her.
Simone saw it. Her voice went soft, wounded.
""Evan, it's okay. She's just upset. I understand.""
Hearing her words, whatever he'd been feeling, it was gone.
""You'd do anything for me, right?"" Evan said, staring at Lila, his tone flat now.""That's what you always said.""
He turned to the two guys standing by the door. ""Hold her. She slapped Simone once. Give her twenty back. She needs to learn.""
Terror shot through Lila. ""Evan, no—"" She tried to back away but there was nowhere to go. ""I didn't touch her—check the cameras!""
""I don't need to. I believe her.""
The first slap came so fast she didn't have time to brace for it.
Her head snapped sideways. Cheek on fire.
Another one before she could breathe. She tasted copper. Again. And again.
She stopped counting after seven. Stopped trying to talk after twelve.
By twenty, she couldn't feel her face anymore.
Her legs gave out.
She went down hard, the room spinning around her.
The last thing she saw before everything went dark was Evan's back as he walked Simone out of the room. His arm around her shoulders. Protective. Gentle.
Lila woke up to Evan sitting beside the bed, wearing gloves, carefully cleaning the cuts on her face with a cotton swab.
When he saw her eyes open, he put the swab down. ""Let's move past this. But if you go after Simone again, you won't get off this easy.""
Lila laughed bitterly. ""You know what I regret most? Ever meeting you.""
His expression shifted. Something uncomfortable flickered in his eyes, but his voice stayed cold. ""Stop being dramatic. It was just twenty slaps. You'll be fine.""
Just twenty slaps. You'll be fine.
Her face was so swollen she could barely open one eye, but to him it was nothing.
""Get out. I don't want to see you.""
Something in his heart tightened when he saw how empty her eyes looked. He hesitated at the door.
""You always said you wanted to sleep with me,"" he said, his tone almost casual. ""Promise you'll leave Simone alone and I'll do it. Isn't that what you wanted?""
He said it like he was doing her a favor.
Lila closed her eyes and said nothing.
For three years she'd tried everything to get him to touch her. Once she'd even stood bare in his bedroom, desperate and humiliated, while he looked at her with disgust and walked away.
And now he was offering?
She didn't need it anymore. All she wanted was to never see him again.
That night, Evan came to her room saying he'd keep his word.
She told him she had her period. He left without arguing.
Later, when she went downstairs for water, she found him in the laundry room washing Simone's underwear by hand.
Simone's UNDERWEAR.
Her heart felt like someone had driven a knife through it.
Evan noticed her standing there. He didn't look embarrassed at all. ""She's pregnant. It's hard for her to move around, and she didn't want to bother the housekeeper, so I'm helping her.""
Lila's nails dug into her palms. The pain in her heart was almost unbearable before she finally nodded.
She didn't even want him anymore. So why should she care whose underwear he washed?
She went back upstairs and started packing.
Three years in this house meant a lot of belongings. In the drawers were all the gifts Evan had given her without much thought—expensive jewelry his assistant had picked out, an empty gelato cup from the one time he'd brought her something without being asked, photo booth strips from when she'd dragged him to the mall.
In those photos, his expression was stiff, but the light had softened his eyes just enough that she'd thought it meant something.
She'd thought all these things were precious. Now they just looked pathetic.
She threw everything in the garbage without hesitation.
Her love for him went with it.
For two weeks, Lila stayed inside. Didn't go out. Just waited for the thirty-day divorce cooling-off period to end.
Then one morning, her phone lit up with a news alert.
[Evan Cross climbs 3,000 steps on his knees to pray for love.]
She clicked the video.
On the screen, rain was pouring. Evan was on his hands and knees climbing stone steps, his suit soaked through with mud, face streaked with dirt.
The man who couldn't stand a speck of dust on his clothes was crawling through filth.
At the top, a priest handed him a blessed bracelet.
Evan bowed low and took it with both hands.
The comments section was going wild.
[Wait so he and Simone were together first? Then she married the brother? Damn that's messy]
[Pretty sure he's married tho?? To that hotel heiress]
[He is but apparently he never gave a sh!t about her. Someone said he let his guys beat her up at a party last week for going after Simone]
Lila's heart went numb. She stared at the screen till the words blurred.
She remembered begging Evan once to visit an old church upstate with her.
He'd said, ""Lila, it's a dirt road. Dusty as he11. Too many people. Stop being selfish for once.""
But now he was crawling through mud for Simone.
She closed the app and went back to packing.
The door slammed open.
Evan walked in, face tight, and grabbed her wrist with his gloved hand. Started dragging her toward the door.
She tried to pull away. Couldn't. ""What are you doing—let go—""
His jaw was set. ""Simone hit someone with her car. The family agreed to settle if someone takes the punishment for five days.""
Lila went cold. ""No! Let go of me! I'm NOT...""
""You are."" He pulled her harder. ""She's pregnant. She can't handle it. They promised they won't kill you. Just rough you up a little."" He shoved her toward the car. ""Besides, you've always wanted a kid, right? Do this for her and I'll give you one.""
Something inside her shattered completely.
She was his wife.
All she'd ever wanted was to have his child. And now he was telling her she had to earn it by taking someone else's beating.
That's what she was worth to him.
The wind dried her tears before they could fall.
She fought. Screamed. Didn't matter. He was stronger.
He tied her up himself and threw her in front of the victim's family like she was nothing.
""There. We're even. Leave Simone alone.""
Lila turned her head and saw the rage in their eyes. Terror clawed at her throat.
""Evan—please—they'll kill me—""
He crouched down and wiped her face with a handkerchief.
For a second, something almost soft passed through his eyes. ""They won't. I made sure. Be good, Lila. I'll come get you when it's over.""
She grabbed his sleeve. He pried her fingers off one by one and stood up.
Her hand reached out again—empty air. He was already at the door.
...
They dragged her into a dark room.
Fists. Sticks. Over and over till she stopped screaming.
They poured boiling water on her arms.
Pressed lit cigars into her skin till it spelled out guilty.
Whipped her with belts soaked in salt water.
Locked her in a coffin with a rotting corpse for an entire night.
When she thought she'd die there, the door exploded inward.
Light flooded the room.
A man stood in the doorway, backlit, his silhouette sharp and dangerous.
""Touch her again,"" his voice cut through the chaos, ""and I'll bury every last one of you.""
Before anyone could react, his men poured in. Bodies hit the floor. Screams. The sound of bones breaking. It was over in seconds.
Strong arms lifted her. She tried to flinch away—couldn't tell friend from enemy anymore—but the grip was careful. Gentle.
""Lila."" 
She knew that voice.
Through the fog of pain, she forced her eyes open.
Rhys Callahan's face came into focus. His expression was cold fury, but his hands were impossibly gentle as he cradled her.
""You're safe now. I've got you. Just sleep.""
She wanted to say something, but her body gave out first.
The last thing she felt was his arms tightening around her as the world faded to black.
...
Five days later, Evan showed up to collect Lila.
The house was empty. Ransacked. Blood on the floor.
""Where is she?"" He grabbed one of the men by the collar. ""Where is my wife?""
The guy's face went white. ""Someone took her. First night. We tried to stop him but—""
""Who?"" Evan's voice dropped to something dangerous. ""What man?""
""We don't know. He had guys. Military-grade weapons. Said if we touched her again he'd—""
Evan didn't wait for the rest. His phone was already out, fingers shaking as he dialed her number.
Simone's hand closed over his wrist. ""Evan, stop. She's probably fine. Just trying to get your attention."" Her voice was soft, reasonable. ""Rhys Callahan's wedding is today. We're already late. You can call her after.""
He stared at the phone. At Simone. Back at the phone.
Put it away. ""Yeah. Alright.""
But the entire drive to the hotel, his leg wouldn't stop bouncing. He checked his phone seven times. No missed calls. No texts. Nothing.
When they pulled up, he forced himself to pocket it and looked toward the entrance.
Red carpet stretched from the street to the doors. White roses everywhere.
And at the end, blown up to the size of a billboard—a wedding photo.
He was about to look away when his brain caught up with what his eyes were seeing.
The woman in the photo wasn't just beautiful. She was radiant. Glowing. Smiling like she'd finally found something worth smiling about.
Red lips. Perfect skin. A white dress that made her look like she was made of light.
His heart stopped.

But I want to share as much about myself as I can, in hope of finding someone who I can resonate with

Short description: 21M, perpetually lonely, live inside my head - almost always watching myself (like i'm constantly aware of what i'm feeling/thinking) as there're no other conventional sources of noise to distract myself, observe think a lot about my own emotional responses to specific situations and exploring possible reasons, think about human behavior a bit, thinking how we can know anything, among others. I want to feel *connected* to someone you know - I have a lot to say (hundreds and hundreds of entries I would like to share with someone), but I haven't really come across someone who I *want* to share things with. *Want* to be with. *Feel* happy and content around. And I think that probably comes from not having relatable thought and experiences with anyone. In my entire life, I've only had (thankfully, still do) a single real friend, but I still don't feel *connected* like I mentioned above.

I'm going to paste some entries from a journal I maintain (the only place where I am myself, and express whatever I think and feel). You can take a look at my other posts, for starters. I've shared quite a lot in them.

1. i've always wanted that ONE connection who can appreciate my thought processes - say to me that they've thought of similar things too, and share them - i'd be VERY happy to see someone with similar thought processes share their thoughts with me, and it would make me WANT to talk to them enthusiastically. i have one friend, but even they don't have nearly the same thought processes as i do, and it's kind of resulting in me losing enthusiasm while talking with them even though they're a wonderful friend. it's like, you see them recounting their experiences, and you light up, saying ""HEY I can relate to THAT!!"" and that instantly would form a bond (not in the light sense, but a bond in an almost literal sense, tying you together tightly, making you WANT {i'm writing WANT in uppercase to emphasize it... like i've never truly WANTED to be with someone, WANTED to talk to them enthusiastically, MISSED them, things like that})...
2. i want to share every single thing, the good and the ugly with them. and it's not just a matter of them not saying it to others (trust), but also a matter of me WANTING to share everything with them and i think that WANT won't arise until i FEEL the WANT, until I can FEEL that they'd appreciate it you know, like... just relatable/resonating experiences and thought processes...
3. i was handling the hot water for making coffee. the coffee powder got over so i thought i could pour water in it (like i'd seen in a reel where the guy had poured water into the glass bottle full of powder, saying it was for exam prep), so that i could use the remaining bit of coffee stuck to the edges, but in an instant, i stopped, asking if the glass could withstand the hot water. now, how exactly was i able to, in that one second, connect the 2 pieces of information - water is hot, and the bottle is made of glass, to produce the new piece of information (question) whether it was safe? i mean in that one second to have thought of it (or rather, to be provided that connection - framing it differently to take away the agency from me) idk... could have very well proceeded with pouring the water. wonder how the brain works, and moreover, \*i\* wasn't in much control of making that connection... we can be more lenient with people, i mean, i wouldn't blame one for not making that connection in an instant...

in the same light, was wondering about secret spilling... i mean, it just takes a moment to blurt out something you ought not to have. now, i somehow seem to possess the ability to remember that i shouldn't say out something aloud, when the conversation skirts around the secret... the thought to say it aloud does form, but so does the counteracting one...

looks like i can cut everyone who spills secrets some slack (unless if they did it deliberately)... i mean can i take much credit, just like the previous case, if the thought just strikes me (and can i blame if the thought doesnt strike them... it takes just a moment i mean)

4. am i saying that *I* dress up not entirely for myself as an objective representation of how i feel, or is it something else, mean, how the hell is one supposed to run an internal diagnostics to figure this out? and forget that, how am i supposed to stop and wonder what spirit i make arguments in? i mean, i think occam's razor fails spectacularly... the easiest explanation for ""i dress up not completely for myself"" is that i actually feel that way (i'm not even talking from a 2nd person's perspective, observing me making this statement, i'm talking about my *own* persp, if i feel this way... the explanation i'm going to be giving myself, implicitly so, is this only), can we ever know anything.  
No proof of whether you're feeling it actually or giving a feeling words from a few data points (see couple -> general feeling of bad {without nuance, just feeling ""low"" when it could be ""jealous"" or anything like that, and that level of nuance could call for a more nuanced explanation than the have/not have narrative that one could use because they have access to only a very generic set of data points and since others say the same, they assign these words. It's like evaluating a model on its output, which is unreliable, without access to internals...

5. random, naive thought... but by molding the brain into frameworks we know and understand (computational model) for our ease of understanding instead of viewing it objectively for what it is, don't we risk reduction?what are models in the first place? trying to represent stuff we see around in the language we understand. for eg., modelling social interactions as graphs (esp Social media followers). now whether a mathematical set of symbols, lines, and numbers can represent the complex realities of connections is a question. but this is what modelling is, i think. \*might\* be reductionist, but that's not my judgement to make. is reality a video, or can be *treated*/*modeled* as a video? is language a *representation* of thought, or thought itself? if these are just representations/models, what *is* the thing itself?

6. for eg., i told the guy i wanted to go to the other room instead of sitting in this area (and asked him if he wanted to come there too), because the tables there were bigger and more comfortable... now that's not the reason for me wanting to switch, the major reason is that i get to be alone, use discord freely and type out my thoughts, talk to gpt... privacy in one word... being free to feel what i feel... but it *does* sound like a valid enough reason, the table thingie... hmm. i think we can further categorize this into conscious and subconscious excuse-reasoning... i consciously knew the actual reason. the other is a subconscious excuse-reasoning in which we want something but we might not know the exact reason and instead, *genuinely* think that another reason is the reason for it... not limited to just achieving something,

7. so i was listening to songs, but found most of the ones in this playlist uninteresting, when i thought that perhaps the probability of me liking a song depends on whether i've listened to it already in childhood or something. now, this wasn't the first time i'd had this thought, but other times, i'd kind of... let the thought pass? like, think of thoughts that keep flowing in a river, and you see them passing by and they drift away. sometimes they come back. today, i ""caught"" the thought, kind of became more... conscious of it? i wouldn't say i hadn't been conscious at all to the previous instances, like, i *had* engaged with it- seen it take birth, acknowledge it with a ""hmm, possible reason"" and kind of let it go without much thought, i hadn't become ""consciously conscious"" if i have to put it that way until now. today, i saw the thought come, and ""caught"" it, and became ""more"" conscious, and am writing about it promptly so are there different ""types"" of thoughts

8. arriving at the wrong conclusion... if someone sees me not talking much in, say a party, they will form a 'hypothesis' that i'm a shy introvert who doesn't want humans. they perform 'experiments', establish 'repeatability' by making me sit in different situations (and unknown to them, implicitly, in groups). they then come to the conclusion that the hypothesis is indeed correct. ""scientifically"", ""data-driven""

but that conclusion is wrong... partially at least i'm that way in *groups*. 1-1, i'm much more comfortable. someone comes across this - like how it was discovered newton's laws don't apply on the quantum level, and only then do they realize the incompleteness of the conclusion.

how do we make the jump - circling around the evidence and suddenly, making the leap to the conclusion, or in a more mathematical manner which i thought of some days back - treating all the evidence as input, how do we design a function that will produce the right conclusion? f(evidence)=conclusion?

i think this is where falsifiability works nicely... some good scientist will seek to actively disprove the hypothesis, and try whatever he can to do so, and in some time, will come across a situation that does so... and if all his attempts are rendered useless, perhaps he could come to the (provisional!) conclusion that i am a shy introvert who doesn't want humans...

(i mean, even now, the conclusion is kind of wrong... it's not like i don't want humans. i desperately seek a deep connection, so when i see it not being fulfilled anywhere around me (in a particular context - say, a schoolmates meeting, and in general too), i don't speak much, and don't appear invested or engaged because i feel it won't lead to anything useful. how do you find \*that\*

9. Was helping him out, for 9 hours almost straight, with one break . Around 11:45, he asked me to stop doing it coz he had to leave. Now, i should have immediately stopped then and there, coz he himself asked me to, and sighed a heave of relief. After all, it's a chore for me, i have nothing to gain from it. But, i insisted on continuing, wanted to finish that task. I still had a bit left at that time, and I didn't want to leave it unfinished. Why the determination to finish it?

One could be a form of perfectionism... The unfinished task would irk me. One simple conclusion (perhaps the one that he, and most people if they'd seen me helping him out, would walk away with) is that I'm just a kind, helpful person and I wanted him to do well, but i don't want to buy this yet.

Some sort of power in helping (do i want someone to feel better, or do *I* want to be the one making them feel better?)? *I* become the reason he possibly scores more marks. In other words, *I* held the power over his marks to an extent.

10. i've kept oscillating b/w reading literature->but i should ""fertilize and till the mind""->lit theory->but wait i also need philosophy to evaluate arguments->but i feel lonely and sad so i need hobbies->back to lit for happiness. and the cycle does on

lol not to forget the ""elon read physics when he was 12 you're reading because you want mushy teen wattpad"" and declaring literature as a waste of time and going back to philosophy only to feel lonely again and think of coming back to lit

11. Was fine initially , although not fully present still... Just forcing laughter and smiles and conversations... But as time passed, especially after food i really wanted to leave and be alone. But I had to stay there... They were talking to others and I didn't know what to do, kept pacing around, with a blank expression on my face. Wanted to... Hit something with a bat, was getting frustrated... There was a bottle in my hand and i kept flinging it from hand to hand rather forcefully, and sometimes trying to squeeze it with my hand...

On more than one occasion I felt like tearing up... Fkn college has sucked all the joy out of life and it's been a fucking miserable 3 years, only to end up here, with almost no job no grades no friends no love fkn hell...

12. was in the review meeting with R. initially it was fine.. doing ok only, working on the edits but as time went by... started becoming dull, wasn't listening to him as intently, just nodding along instead of sharing my inputs as well, and he might have noticed i was visibly duller, i probably would have used the age old excuse of being sleepy..

was walking back, and this time i wasn't even feeling lonely (i know how loneliness feels, i want her {her is not any specific, real person, but an imaginary companion i sometimes \[fine not sometimes\] think of to cope} beside me to hug me, this time i didn't really want it, and even picturing her didn't help much when it is clear that it \*would\* help if she were by me). just slowly trudged along with a dull, indifferent expression. reached my room and had a couple of tears for absolutely no reason. i just was feeling very less enthusiastic and automaticity also went down... i had to kickstart my limbs from the usual halt when, say, eating the snack... the hand just stopped midway. twitched a couple of times.

13. was feeling empty as usual, tried to talk with people on the group, but they were kids. Switched off light, tried hugging the pillow to feel some semblance of touch, to no avail. Had a tear or two, dried up, repeated. Then started crying full-blown. Complete with sobbing...convulsive gasps

was muttering ""i dont want to feel this way anymore"" (went back to 3rd sem...i think it started in 1st sem, but it hadn't become this intense, just signs - ""how to make friends"", ""frientimacy"" such videos.)

hope kept dwindling...how am i going to find someone to feel connected with. (remembered the image which was eerily similar to mine. )

thought of asking for help...from my college sub. even from someone irl. wanted to cry on someone's shoulder while being held. not some nobody, but someone who'd get it...

1pzrt5b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzrt5b,Most “Dad” Experience While Brisketing,"I had one of my most “Dad” experiences to date while smoking the brisket above. First, for some reason my pellet grill (Yoder YS640) was having a REALLY tough time getting up to temp. I had to crank it all the way up to 340° just get an ambient temp of about 230°, which has never happened. 

I was tracking the temp on my phone through a new-ish probe app. I set it to alert me when the temp in 185° so I can check for color and wrapping. I go to bed after I dial in the right ambient temp. My phone is low on battery but I plug it into the charger before I go to sleep.

At some time in the night my 3-yr-old starts crying from a nightmare. I go to calm him down and sleep with him for a bit. I bring my phone which apparently was still not sufficiently charged. Phone dies while I’m asleep in my son’s room.

Around 5 a.m., I happen to wake up and notice my dead phone. I’m slightly worried I missed the temp check but I also know I’m nowhere near my final target of 204°. I go out to the living room to charge my phone with my computer charger (way faster). Then I hear a quiet beeping from outside. 

It’s the temperature probe’s charging dock, which also tracks the temp. It’s beeping because I had hit 185°. I get slightly more worried wondering how much I overshot my target. I get outside and see the internal temp is 187°. I happened to naturally wake up JUST as I hit my target. I felt like a Jedi or something.

**TLDR: My phone died in the night so I wasn’t alerted when my brisket hit its target temp. By complete luck, I woke up almost exactly when it hit the target temp.**

Cook details:
About 10 lbs flat from a 24lbs Prime brisket from Costco. Seasoned with 2 parts Killer Hogs TX Brisket Rub and 1 part Traeger Coffee Rub. Smoked for 9 hours on Yoder YS640 with GMG Texas Blend pellets at about 230° ambient temp until internal temp was 185°. Foil boat with tallow. Smoked for another 2 hours at 270° ambient temp. Rested for about 3 hours in a Cambro food storage box wrapped in a couple of towels. 

I LOVE the addition of Coffee Rub, which I’ve never tried before. I think the brown sugar really added to the bark color and I really liked the slight sweetness against all the salt.",19,1767124072.0,smoking,1,0.88,False

You already had the chance to say it in person, like maybe over coffee, a card, or even just a genuine moment that didn’t need likes.  So, turning it into a public post can feel less about celebrating the person and more about signaling to everyone else, “Look, I’m a good partner!"" At that point, the message isn’t really for them; it’s for the audience.

It’s even stranger when the birthday wish shows up as a comment on the other person’s Facebook post, like a digital sticky note slapped onto a relationship that already exists offline. Real connection doesn’t need a timeline reminder or heart emojis to be valid. When you live together, the most meaningful birthday wishes are private, personal, and real, not scrolled past between memes and ads. Saving affection for real life instead of broadcasting it online just hits harder and feels way less forced.

By sunset, the Diaz living room looked like a daycare exploded. Markers, glitter, and Meteora's discarded tiara littered the floor. Mariposa and Holly were under the coffee table, sugar-crashing on cartoons.

Janna sat in the center of the chaos, rolling a green crystal across her knuckles. ""Okay, gremlins,"" she said. ""Citrine is for confidence. Fluorite is for focus. Amethyst is for not screaming at bedtime.""

Meteora perched on a pillow. ""Can you make Mom not scream when I stay up?""

""You're gonna need a priest for that,"" Janna said, handing her an amethyst. She tapped her own matching lilac pendant. ""Helps when your brain is static-y.""

Angie bustled in from the kitchen. ""Heading out! Everyone got shoes? Bags? Babysitter?""

""I am babysitter,"" Janna called. ""Certified.""

""Certified gremlin,"" Mariposa corrected, climbing into Janna's lap. Janna let her, settling between the kids and the cat like a soft, unadvertised shield.

Marco watched from the hallway, leaning on the doorframe. He remembered high school Janna as an agent of chaos—stealing his wallet, poking his cheek. This version was the same, but... not.

""Hey,"" he said. ""Running to the store. We're low on snacks.""

Janna tilted her head back. ""Get churros. For science.""

Marco felt his ears heat, remembering cinnamon sugar and the fight with Star that still sat like a bruise. ""Just chips,"" he said, grabbing his keys. ""We can't feed them only sugar.""

""We can,"" Janna said. ""We just shouldn't.""

***

In the neon chaos of Cloud Kingdom, Star paced a groove into Pony Head's floor. Her phone glared back: *Message Failed.*

""She blocked me,"" Star said, voice tight. ""She actually blocked me.""

""Uh, people with boundaries?"" Pony Head suggested from the couch. ""You kinda slammed her into a salsa bowl.""

""It was an accident!"" Star flopped face-down on the cloud. ""I was trying to calm down! And she was being so... smug. With her little gremlin eyebrows.""

""Maybe give her space?"" Pony Head said. ""You can't speed-run forgiveness, B-Fly.""

""I apologized!"" Star rolled over. ""But she just stared at me. And now she's living at Marco's, playing Aunt Janna, and I'm... out.""

Pony Head's phone buzzed. ""Your Buff Frog Uber is here.""

Star sat up, grabbing her jacket. ""I'm going to the Diaz house.""

""Girl, no. That is the opposite of space.""

""I have to fix it,"" Star insisted, eyes wet. ""I can't lose her, Pony.""

***

Back at the house, Janna had just located baby carrots when the front door exploded inward with a crack of splintering wood.

""JANNA ROSE ORDOΝΙΑ!""

The house froze. Star stood in the ruined doorway, chest heaving, boots still raised from the kick.

Meteora blinked. ""Aunt Star?""

Janna stared at the carrots. *""Heto na naman siya...""*

""DON'T SPEAK FILIPINO AT ME!"" Star yelled. ""WHY DID YOU BLOCK ME?""

Janna set the carrots down. ""Inside voice, Sparkles. You're scaring the kids.""

Star's fury faltered as she looked at her nieces. ""I... I just need to talk to Janna.""

Janna ushered the girls toward the stairs. ""Go pick a movie. I'll be up in five.""

Once they were gone, Star broke. ""You blocked me. You hypnotized me at the sleepover, and then you blocked me.""

""You almost broke my neck,"" Janna said, rubbing her temple. ""You slammed me into the floor.""

""I said I was sorry!""

""You yelled it while I was holding an ice pack.""

The broken door creaked. Marco backed in, juggling grocery bags. ""I got sna—"" He froze. Star. Broken door. Janna standing like a shield.

""...oh no,"" he whispered, instinctively stepping behind Janna.

Star saw the movement. Her face hollowed out. ""Wow. Okay. That's new.""

""Marco!"" she cried. ""Why are you hiding? I'm not a monster.""

""You broke my door,"" he said weakly.

""I came to talk! And she—"" Star pointed at Janna. ""She's acting like I'm the problem.""

""You kicked the door in,"" Janna pointed out. ""Textbook problem behavior.""

""Shut up, Janna! You steal his wallet and food and now you're his bodyguard?"" Star's hands curled into fists. ""You block me and flirt with my ex like it's your job. You're seducing him with your gremlin powers!""

Janna stared. ""...bro what.""

""Don't think I forgot the Realm of Magic,"" Star barreled on. ""You two in the goop. Just staring at each other. You think I'm stupid?""

""Nobody remembers the goop,"" Janna said. ""We were amnesiacs.""

""I remember! You've always liked him. You can't just pretend you haven't and then move in like a home-wrecker!""

""Whoa, nobody is home-wrecking,"" Marco said, stepping forward.

""Don't take her side!"" Star screamed. ""You're looking at her like you used to look at me!""

The room swayed. Janna felt her heart thudding against her fluorite. ""Star,"" she said quietly. ""You're making it about you again. You yelled at him last Tuesday for eating churros with me. You decided we were dating because of cinnamon sugar.""

""I saw you kiss him!"" Star shouted.

*""Hindi—""* Janna sputtered. ""It wasn't a kiss.""

""So what was it?"" Star laughed sharply.

""Star,"" Marco cut in, voice low. ""No. Janna's right.""

Star whipped toward him.

""I kissed her,"" Marco said.

Star looked like she'd been slapped. ""Marco, stay out of this.""

Janna swallowed hard, hand curling in her pocket. ""I didn't initiate anything,"" she said. ""I froze.""

""So you did want it,"" Star latched on. ""Say it. Just say you want him.""

Janna flinched. The mask cracked. ""I don't know what I want, okay?"" she snapped. *""Hindi ko alam.""*

The confession hung naked between them.

""You took him,"" Star whispered, tears spilling. ""You took him, and my nieces, and my gremlin. You take everything.""

""Star,"" Marco said softly. ""We didn't forget you.""

""You did.""

Marco stepped toward her, hand raised to comfort her, but stopped. ""Star, you can't just yell at people and expect it to be okay because you say sorry. People need space. You told me that.""

""I don't want space anymore!"" she sobbed. ""I want my life back. I want it to stop feeling like everyone moved on without me.""

""I get that,"" he said. ""But you can't kick down my door and scream at my friend.""

Star looked between them. ""So that's it? You're defending her?""

""I'm not defending the sleepover,"" Marco said. ""But you attacked her. You can't pretend that didn't happen.""

Star's face crumpled. ""Fine. I take back the apology. Happy?""

""Not even a little,"" Janna muttered.

A car horn honked outside. Star inhaled sharply. ""My ride's here. Screw you both.""

She turned and stalked out into the cold. The house exhaled.

Marco stood uselessly in the living room. Janna sagged against the banister.

""Storm's over,"" Marco said, finding his voice.

""For now,"" Janna muttered.

***

Later, after Star had cried in Buff Frog's car and Janna had put the kids to bed with protection spells and pizza had been ordered, the house finally settled.

Marco and Janna sat on the couch, pizza box open between them. The adrenaline was fading into a heavy, quiet exhaustion.

""So,"" Marco said. ""That was... a lot.""

""Certified Sagittarius meltdown,"" Janna agreed, chewing a crust.

He looked at her, really looked at her—the bruise on her jaw, the way she hunched. ""I hate that you get hurt because of our mess,"" he said. ""It's not supposed to be like that.""

She shrugged. ""Welcome to the blast radius.""

He nudged her foot. ""Hey. About what you said. 'I don't know what I want.'""

Janna stiffened. ""Yeah, cue for me to shut up. Let's talk about pizza.""

""Janna."" He shifted closer. ""You don't have to pretend with me. Not right now.""

Her heart stuttered. ""Too bad, Diaz. Pretending's my brand.""

He patted his thigh in a half-joking invite. ""Wanna sit closer? Pretend you're stealing body heat?""

She stared at him. Then, in a blur of worn denim, she crawled the short distance and planted herself in his lap.

He made a startled *oof*. ""Uhh. Hi.""

""Hi,"" she said. ""You're warm. Don't make it weird.""

""It was weird when you climbed me like a tree."" He adjusted his grip, hands settling on her waist. Her hoodie rode up, exposing the strip of soft skin at her stomach. He felt the give of it under his palms.

""Oh,"" he said without thinking. ""You're... soft.""

Heat shot up her neck. She slapped his hand. ""Hey. That's my tactical blubber. You can't just—""

He squeezed gently. ""Janna, please,"" he said. ""You're perfect.""

Her sarcasm died. ""I'm not... skinny like Star,"" she blurted. ""Or Jackie. I'm just... gremlin-shaped.""

""So? I like you.""

She searched his face for the joke. There wasn't one.

""Marco?"" she whispered.

""Yeah?""

""I'm tired of... pretending.""

His heart jumped. ""Pretending what?""

""...That I don't want this."" Her eyes flicked to his mouth. ""That I don't want... you.""

The words landed like a live wire. ""Uh. Okay—""

She flinched. ""Forget I said anything—""

""Janna. Look at me.""

She did. He cupped her cheek, thumb brushing her chin. ""It's not weird to want things,"" he said. ""You can want me. Because I... I want you too.""

She studied him. Then, slowly, she leaned in.

It wasn’t a polite kiss. It wasn’t the kind of kiss you see in movies with swelling violins and perfect lighting. It was messy, desperate, and terrifyingly real.

For a second, Janna forgot where she was. She forgot about the timeline, the paradox, and the sarcastic armor she’d spent twenty-two years welding to her skin. There was only the heat of Marco’s hands on her waist and the overwhelming, terrifying realization that he wasn’t pulling away.

*He wasn’t pulling away.*

Her brain glitched. The logic centers of her mind—usually so sharp, so cynical—dissolved into static. She wasn’t the cool, detached Janna Ordonia anymore. She was just... wanting.

When they finally broke apart, the silence in the room was louder than a scream.

Janna pulled back, her chest heaving as she stared at him. Marco looked wrecked—hair disheveled, lips swollen, eyes wide with the same panic she felt clawing at her throat.

The air between them felt thin, charged with electricity that made the hair on her arms stand up. She tried to find a joke, a deflection, *anything* to pull the ripcord and escape this moment.

But her mouth wouldn't cooperate. Her filter was gone.

*""Tangina,""* she breathed, the curse slipping out in a breathless whisper.

Marco blinked, looking dazed. ""What?""

Janna slammed her hand over her mouth, face burning. ""I said... I’m tired of pretending.""

""Janna,"" he said, unsteady. ""Babe...""

The word slipped out. They both froze.

""We probably shouldn't be doing this,"" he stammered. ""Kids upstairs... Star just left... I don't want to hurt anybody—""

Her hands tightened in his shirt. ""Shut up,"" she said softly. ""Just... for once, shut up and don't overthink it.""

He laughed, breathless. ""You're asking a lot.""

She kissed him again. Deliberate. Messy. Real.

The doorbell rang.

They jolted apart like they'd been scalded. ""Oh, come on,"" Janna groaned, scrambling off his lap. ""Wow.""

Marco scrubbed his face. ""I—got carried away.""

""Terrible,"" she said faintly. ""Hated it. Never do it again.""

The bell rang again.

""Your moms,"" Janna said, voice high. ""We gotta look normal.""

They rushed to the door. Eclipsa stood there. The broken door swung open on its own.

""Well,"" Eclipsa said, eyeing the damage. ""That's welcoming.""

""Star happened,"" Marco said, ears pink.

Angie stepped in. *""Marco Antonio Diaz. Arregla esto ahora.""*

Eclipsa's gaze slid to the living room—the pizza, the pillows, the two adults radiating panic. She smiled knowingly but said nothing.

Later, when the door was fixed and the house was quiet, Janna lay in the guest room in the dark.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Marco.

A meme: *Fat tummies are sexy.*

She stared at it, then typed back: *Certified gago.*

Another bubble: *...does that mean you forgive me for the tactical blubber comment?*

Janna's lips twitched.

*Hindi.*

Then, after a beat:

*...maybe.*

1pzrqiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/autismUK/comments/1pzrqiw/is_mental_health_support_in_the_uk_just_social/,Is mental health support in the UK just social prescribing in disguise? My experience as a professional with late-diagnosed autism.,"I’ve spent the last few years navigating the local support landscape in the UK (specifically looking at charities and NHS funded partners), and I’ve come to a frustrating realisation. I wanted to see if this is just my local area or if this is the national standard.

Background: I’m a high-functioning professional, late-diagnosed, and I was seeking clinical support to manage burnout and help with workplace adjustments. Instead of clinical expertise, I found a system that seems entirely built on social prescribing rather than clinical Intervention.

Over the past four years, I've asked for help from a number of services. 

Most recently, I applied for support from several charities in early summer this year when I hit a breaking point. For six months, I heard nothing. Zero contact. No hello, we haven't forgotten you. Just silence.
Now, in the few days between Christmas and New Year, every single one of them has suddenly rushed back to me. Why the sudden interest? My only explanation is the funding cycle. It’s the end of the quarter/year; they need new customers on their lists to justify their government grants for next year. It’s not about my crisis, it’s about their balance sheet. 

What I’ve observed below.

Most counsellors in these organizations aren't psychologists. They are BACP/NCPS registered with Level 4 Diplomas or trainees. To someone used to a clinical model, it feels like listening rather than treatment.

Sucess stories on their websites are all about people being cured by painting, joining a choir, or learning three guitar chords. If you already have a job and a family,  filling your time with hobbies isn't the issue, brain chemistry and legal protections are.

They seemed to want me to stay in a vulnerable uninformed state so they can monitor me or were patronising by default, assuming I lack the capacity to understand. Eventually I got tired of explaining that I work full time, have a career and no, unsupervised loud coffee mornings at lunchtime during working hours don't really suit my full time working day. The moment I asked for their approach, qualifications and results (like a medical report for HR), they backed off. It felt like check-ins with zero strategy and outcome in mind. 

I won’t even start on the limited sessions of CBT where I was taught how to count on my fingers (5 things you see, 4 you hear etc.), boxed breathing, and other tools you can find in 30 seconds on Google. Why is there a 6 month waiting list for a YouTube tutorial?

Or the GPs handing out SSRIs like they’re sweets without any specialised oversight.

Or the workplace mindfulness trap, pushing meditation like it’s a miracle cure for a sensory-overloaded brain.

It feels like there is no specialised help for people who are high-functioning and self-aware enough to recognise when they are approaching a crisis. Because I can articulate that I am struggling, the system assumes I am well enough to not need urgent help.

It seems the only way to get real attention is to be in an active, life-threatening crisis. But even then, the help isn't therapeutic. It’s Sectioning, detained under the Mental Health Act. The system ignores you until it’s too late, and then it responds by taking away your rights and your control entirely. It’s a traumatizing binary: you are either fine and left with breathing exercises, or you are detained and lose your autonomy. There is absolutely nothing in the middle for people who want to prevent the crash before it happens.

And of course there is zero awareness about hormones and how perimenopause for example can affect some autistic women and exacerbate symptoms like hypersensitivity. HRT alone reduced 50% of my issues and gave me back some basic functionality. 

I’ve eventually had to go private to find a consultant psychiatrist, the only person who actually has the clinical weight to help.

Has anyone else found that UK mental health charities are basically just community centers with a therapy label? Or am I just expecting too much from a system that isn't designed for neurodivergent professionals? Or it's just bad luck living in a small town? ",12,1767123910.0,autismUK,3,0.93,False
1pzrq9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1pzrq9p/question_for_us_roasters_and_importers_handling/,Question for US roasters and importers: handling small specialty green coffee lots already in the US,"
Hi everyone,
I’m an Ethiopian coffee producer/exporter and I’m looking to learn from people with experience in the US specialty coffee market.

From your perspective, what’s the most effective way for roasters to engage with small volumes of specialty green coffee that are already imported and available domestically? Do roasters generally prefer direct sourcing in these cases, or is it more common to work through brokers or local representatives?

For background only: I currently have specialty Guji green coffee warehoused in Atlanta, which raised questions for me about best practices, expectations, and common pitfalls when approaching roasters at this scale.

I’d appreciate any insight on:
	•	Preferred sourcing channels for small lots
	•	When brokers add the most value
	•	General advice for navigating the US specialty market responsibly

Thanks in advance for sharing your experience.",0,1767123894.0,roasting,0,0.5,False

But I want to share as much about myself as I can, in hope of finding someone who I can resonate with

Short description: 21M, perpetually lonely, live inside my head - almost always watching myself (like i'm constantly aware of what i'm feeling/thinking) as there're no other conventional sources of noise to distract myself, observe think a lot about my own emotional responses to specific situations and exploring possible reasons, think about human behavior a bit, thinking how we can know anything, among others. I want to feel *connected* to someone you know - I have a lot to say (hundreds and hundreds of entries I would like to share with someone), but I haven't really come across someone who I *want* to share things with. *Want* to be with. *Feel* happy and content around. And I think that probably comes from not having relatable thought and experiences with anyone. In my entire life, I've only had (thankfully, still do) a single real friend, but I still don't feel *connected* like I mentioned above.

I'm going to paste some entries from a journal I maintain (the only place where I am myself, and express whatever I think and feel). You can take a look at my other posts, for starters. I've shared quite a lot in them.

1. i've always wanted that ONE connection who can appreciate my thought processes - say to me that they've thought of similar things too, and share them - i'd be VERY happy to see someone with similar thought processes share their thoughts with me, and it would make me WANT to talk to them enthusiastically. i have one friend, but even they don't have nearly the same thought processes as i do, and it's kind of resulting in me losing enthusiasm while talking with them even though they're a wonderful friend. it's like, you see them recounting their experiences, and you light up, saying ""HEY I can relate to THAT!!"" and that instantly would form a bond (not in the light sense, but a bond in an almost literal sense, tying you together tightly, making you WANT {i'm writing WANT in uppercase to emphasize it... like i've never truly WANTED to be with someone, WANTED to talk to them enthusiastically, MISSED them, things like that})...
2. i want to share every single thing, the good and the ugly with them. and it's not just a matter of them not saying it to others (trust), but also a matter of me WANTING to share everything with them and i think that WANT won't arise until i FEEL the WANT, until I can FEEL that they'd appreciate it you know, like... just relatable/resonating experiences and thought processes...
3. i was handling the hot water for making coffee. the coffee powder got over so i thought i could pour water in it (like i'd seen in a reel where the guy had poured water into the glass bottle full of powder, saying it was for exam prep), so that i could use the remaining bit of coffee stuck to the edges, but in an instant, i stopped, asking if the glass could withstand the hot water. now, how exactly was i able to, in that one second, connect the 2 pieces of information - water is hot, and the bottle is made of glass, to produce the new piece of information (question) whether it was safe? i mean in that one second to have thought of it (or rather, to be provided that connection - framing it differently to take away the agency from me) idk... could have very well proceeded with pouring the water. wonder how the brain works, and moreover, \*i\* wasn't in much control of making that connection... we can be more lenient with people, i mean, i wouldn't blame one for not making that connection in an instant...

in the same light, was wondering about secret spilling... i mean, it just takes a moment to blurt out something you ought not to have. now, i somehow seem to possess the ability to remember that i shouldn't say out something aloud, when the conversation skirts around the secret... the thought to say it aloud does form, but so does the counteracting one...

looks like i can cut everyone who spills secrets some slack (unless if they did it deliberately)... i mean can i take much credit, just like the previous case, if the thought just strikes me (and can i blame if the thought doesnt strike them... it takes just a moment i mean)

4. am i saying that *I* dress up not entirely for myself as an objective representation of how i feel, or is it something else, mean, how the hell is one supposed to run an internal diagnostics to figure this out? and forget that, how am i supposed to stop and wonder what spirit i make arguments in? i mean, i think occam's razor fails spectacularly... the easiest explanation for ""i dress up not completely for myself"" is that i actually feel that way (i'm not even talking from a 2nd person's perspective, observing me making this statement, i'm talking about my *own* persp, if i feel this way... the explanation i'm going to be giving myself, implicitly so, is this only), can we ever know anything.  
No proof of whether you're feeling it actually or giving a feeling words from a few data points (see couple -> general feeling of bad {without nuance, just feeling ""low"" when it could be ""jealous"" or anything like that, and that level of nuance could call for a more nuanced explanation than the have/not have narrative that one could use because they have access to only a very generic set of data points and since others say the same, they assign these words. It's like evaluating a model on its output, which is unreliable, without access to internals...

5. random, naive thought... but by molding the brain into frameworks we know and understand (computational model) for our ease of understanding instead of viewing it objectively for what it is, don't we risk reduction?what are models in the first place? trying to represent stuff we see around in the language we understand. for eg., modelling social interactions as graphs (esp Social media followers). now whether a mathematical set of symbols, lines, and numbers can represent the complex realities of connections is a question. but this is what modelling is, i think. \*might\* be reductionist, but that's not my judgement to make. is reality a video, or can be *treated*/*modeled* as a video? is language a *representation* of thought, or thought itself? if these are just representations/models, what *is* the thing itself?

6. for eg., i told the guy i wanted to go to the other room instead of sitting in this area (and asked him if he wanted to come there too), because the tables there were bigger and more comfortable... now that's not the reason for me wanting to switch, the major reason is that i get to be alone, use discord freely and type out my thoughts, talk to gpt... privacy in one word... being free to feel what i feel... but it *does* sound like a valid enough reason, the table thingie... hmm. i think we can further categorize this into conscious and subconscious excuse-reasoning... i consciously knew the actual reason. the other is a subconscious excuse-reasoning in which we want something but we might not know the exact reason and instead, *genuinely* think that another reason is the reason for it... not limited to just achieving something,

7. so i was listening to songs, but found most of the ones in this playlist uninteresting, when i thought that perhaps the probability of me liking a song depends on whether i've listened to it already in childhood or something. now, this wasn't the first time i'd had this thought, but other times, i'd kind of... let the thought pass? like, think of thoughts that keep flowing in a river, and you see them passing by and they drift away. sometimes they come back. today, i ""caught"" the thought, kind of became more... conscious of it? i wouldn't say i hadn't been conscious at all to the previous instances, like, i *had* engaged with it- seen it take birth, acknowledge it with a ""hmm, possible reason"" and kind of let it go without much thought, i hadn't become ""consciously conscious"" if i have to put it that way until now. today, i saw the thought come, and ""caught"" it, and became ""more"" conscious, and am writing about it promptly so are there different ""types"" of thoughts

8. arriving at the wrong conclusion... if someone sees me not talking much in, say a party, they will form a 'hypothesis' that i'm a shy introvert who doesn't want humans. they perform 'experiments', establish 'repeatability' by making me sit in different situations (and unknown to them, implicitly, in groups). they then come to the conclusion that the hypothesis is indeed correct. ""scientifically"", ""data-driven""

but that conclusion is wrong... partially at least i'm that way in *groups*. 1-1, i'm much more comfortable. someone comes across this - like how it was discovered newton's laws don't apply on the quantum level, and only then do they realize the incompleteness of the conclusion.

how do we make the jump - circling around the evidence and suddenly, making the leap to the conclusion, or in a more mathematical manner which i thought of some days back - treating all the evidence as input, how do we design a function that will produce the right conclusion? f(evidence)=conclusion?

i think this is where falsifiability works nicely... some good scientist will seek to actively disprove the hypothesis, and try whatever he can to do so, and in some time, will come across a situation that does so... and if all his attempts are rendered useless, perhaps he could come to the (provisional!) conclusion that i am a shy introvert who doesn't want humans...

(i mean, even now, the conclusion is kind of wrong... it's not like i don't want humans. i desperately seek a deep connection, so when i see it not being fulfilled anywhere around me (in a particular context - say, a schoolmates meeting, and in general too), i don't speak much, and don't appear invested or engaged because i feel it won't lead to anything useful. how do you find \*that\*

9. Was helping him out, for 9 hours almost straight, with one break . Around 11:45, he asked me to stop doing it coz he had to leave. Now, i should have immediately stopped then and there, coz he himself asked me to, and sighed a heave of relief. After all, it's a chore for me, i have nothing to gain from it. But, i insisted on continuing, wanted to finish that task. I still had a bit left at that time, and I didn't want to leave it unfinished. Why the determination to finish it?

One could be a form of perfectionism... The unfinished task would irk me. One simple conclusion (perhaps the one that he, and most people if they'd seen me helping him out, would walk away with) is that I'm just a kind, helpful person and I wanted him to do well, but i don't want to buy this yet.

Some sort of power in helping (do i want someone to feel better, or do *I* want to be the one making them feel better?)? *I* become the reason he possibly scores more marks. In other words, *I* held the power over his marks to an extent.

10. i've kept oscillating b/w reading literature->but i should ""fertilize and till the mind""->lit theory->but wait i also need philosophy to evaluate arguments->but i feel lonely and sad so i need hobbies->back to lit for happiness. and the cycle does on

lol not to forget the ""elon read physics when he was 12 you're reading because you want mushy teen wattpad"" and declaring literature as a waste of time and going back to philosophy only to feel lonely again and think of coming back to lit

11. Was fine initially , although not fully present still... Just forcing laughter and smiles and conversations... But as time passed, especially after food i really wanted to leave and be alone. But I had to stay there... They were talking to others and I didn't know what to do, kept pacing around, with a blank expression on my face. Wanted to... Hit something with a bat, was getting frustrated... There was a bottle in my hand and i kept flinging it from hand to hand rather forcefully, and sometimes trying to squeeze it with my hand...

On more than one occasion I felt like tearing up... Fkn college has sucked all the joy out of life and it's been a fucking miserable 3 years, only to end up here, with almost no job no grades no friends no love fkn hell...

12. was in the review meeting with R. initially it was fine.. doing ok only, working on the edits but as time went by... started becoming dull, wasn't listening to him as intently, just nodding along instead of sharing my inputs as well, and he might have noticed i was visibly duller, i probably would have used the age old excuse of being sleepy..

was walking back, and this time i wasn't even feeling lonely (i know how loneliness feels, i want her {her is not any specific, real person, but an imaginary companion i sometimes \[fine not sometimes\] think of to cope} beside me to hug me, this time i didn't really want it, and even picturing her didn't help much when it is clear that it \*would\* help if she were by me). just slowly trudged along with a dull, indifferent expression. reached my room and had a couple of tears for absolutely no reason. i just was feeling very less enthusiastic and automaticity also went down... i had to kickstart my limbs from the usual halt when, say, eating the snack... the hand just stopped midway. twitched a couple of times.

13. was feeling empty as usual, tried to talk with people on the group, but they were kids. Switched off light, tried hugging the pillow to feel some semblance of touch, to no avail. Had a tear or two, dried up, repeated. Then started crying full-blown. Complete with sobbing...convulsive gasps

was muttering ""i dont want to feel this way anymore"" (went back to 3rd sem...i think it started in 1st sem, but it hadn't become this intense, just signs - ""how to make friends"", ""frientimacy"" such videos.)

hope kept dwindling...how am i going to find someone to feel connected with. (remembered the image which was eerily similar to mine. )

thought of asking for help...from my college sub. even from someone irl. wanted to cry on someone's shoulder while being held. not some nobody, but someone who'd get it...

If you've made it to here, thanks for reading it! and if you resonate... you know what to do! I'd like to have a deep connection... just posting it here, shooting my shot... thanks again and take care!",1,1767123878.0,chennaicity,0,1.0,False

It’ll be our first time on this ship (7th cruise overall), and I have a few questions I haven’t seen clearly answered yet.

We’re booked for Chef’s Table on the first sea day. From what I’ve read, this ship usually keeps the scheduled date/time due to demand, is that true? Also, are they still doing the galley tour on Mardi Gras? My husband is a chef and is really looking forward to seeing the kitchen operations.

While we are on food, we used to love Your Time Dining, but our first post-COVID sailing on Elation was not what we remember. We had app issues, long waits, & cold food. Not sure if it was the boat or what but it turned us off it for sure. Is YTD better organized on Mardi Gras? Can you log into the app when it opens and select a future reservation time, or how does it work on this ship? I read here that YTD lets you choose other venues (ChiBang and another I can't remember), does that help with wait times? If we stick with assigned dining instead, can we still access those venues around our preferred 6:30 pm time?

I know you can bring condiments but is there a size limit? Do they need to be factory sealed, or should we transfer them into smaller bottles? This is for those flavored coffee syrups, my hubs is semi-addicted and we've never wanted to bring anything previously.

We splurged for our 25th anniversary and booked a Havana Cabana, our first balcony ever! Is the Havana pool heated, or does it run cold? (75 is cold to us) Any perks or tips specific to Havana rooms we should know about? And yes, we know it is not the same as typical balconies but we booked the one we did because it shows that the room will have 2 loungers in the sun on the walkway in front of our room and hubs likes afternoon sun naps. Oh, is the door to the outdoor bar/lounge area open ever between the rooms walkway? 

How well separated are the casino areas? Is it truly $moke free in the $moke free section, and are there plenty of blackjack tables there? ($=s because it wouldn't let me post, flagged for rule #1) It isn't a huge deal but just curious.

Is embarkation noticeably crazier with a ship this size, or fairly smooth like our Glory sailing which was also late Jan/early Feb? We typically schedule 11am and arrive early cause the excitement has us on no sleep ins from the night before, lol.

Lastly, if you have any hidden gems or can't miss things on Mardi Gras, I’d love to hear them. Thanks in advance, we’re excited to explore the ship and can't wait to get away!",1,1767123855.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,0,1.0,False

1pzrl8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pzrl8a/i_think_ive_been_confusing_being_good_in/,I think I’ve been confusing being “good” in relationships with being afraid,"From the outside, my life looks fine.  
Good job in tech, long-term girlfriend, go to the gym, functional adult. People tell me I’m doing well and I believe them because there’s no obvious reason not to.

But for a long time I’ve felt like I’m watching my own life instead of actually being in it. Like I’m playing myself convincingly but not really feeling connected to what’s happening. I’m not depressed. I’ve been depressed before and this isn’t that. It’s more like I’m always slightly braced for something.

A few months ago I had some time between meetings and went to sit in a park near my office. There was an older guy sitting on a bench and for reasons I still don’t fully understand, I ended up talking to him. I told him about how tense I always feel, how I’m exhausted from holding everything together all the time, how I feel like I’m constantly trying to make sure everything’s okay.

He didn’t really respond at first. Then he pointed at a tree growing out of a crack in the sidewalk and said something like, “It doesn’t grow where it’s strong. It grows where it’s damaged.” Then he said I was trying to make myself too rigid and that rigid things eventually break. That was basically the whole conversation.

I sat there for a while after he left and something clicked that I’ve been avoiding for years.

I’ve always thought trauma was about specific events. My dad leaving when I was a kid. A bad accident in college. Stuff I don’t really talk about. I figured since those things were in the past, the best move was to be disciplined, functional, and not let them affect me.

But my body never really got that memo. I still wake up tense. I still feel my chest tighten around certain people or situations. I still feel like I’m monitoring everything all the time. Whatever happened back then didn’t stay back then.

Growing up, I learned pretty early that being easy to deal with made life smoother. If I didn’t need much, didn’t complain, didn’t get angry, people stayed calm. I got praised for being mature and understanding. It worked. I survived.

What I didn’t realize until recently is that I got really good at it. Too good. I learned how to read people constantly. Their tone, their face, their mood. I adjust myself in real time without even thinking about it.

My girlfriend used to say I was incredibly attentive. What she didn’t see was that I was always watching her for signs that I’d done something wrong. That I was managing her reactions so I wouldn’t feel that familiar drop in my stomach. I thought that was love. I’m starting to realize it was fear.

My friends think I’m laid-back. I’m not. I just don’t say what I want most of the time because it feels safer not to. My boss thinks I’m a team player. I am, but a big part of that is knowing that being useful feels more secure than being honest.

At some point I stopped doing this just to survive and started doing it to control situations. Not in a malicious way, but in a way that kept people from getting close enough to see how little I actually knew who I was without adapting to them.

When I stopped doing that as much, things got harder before they got better. I got angrier than I expected. Petty, resentful anger. I realized how much I’d swallowed over the years. I also got needier than I was comfortable with. I’d spent decades being the low-maintenance one and suddenly I wanted reassurance and space and patience.

My girlfriend left a few months after that. Not because she was cruel. Because the version of me she fell in love with wasn’t fully real, and when I changed, the relationship didn’t fit anymore. I lost a couple friends too. Turns out some people like you best when you don’t ask for much.

I’m still figuring this out. I still catch myself defaulting to being “easy.” But recently someone at work asked how I was doing and instead of saying “fine,” I said it had been a rough day. They didn’t fix anything. They didn’t leave. They just listened and bought me a coffee.

That’s it. I don’t have a big conclusion. I just needed to get this off my chest.",2,1767123583.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1pzrjx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacationclub/comments/1pzrjx2/vero_beach_service/,Vero beach service,"Hi there,

Just got back from Vero Beach for the first time. There were things we loved about it and some things that were not as great. We love the relaxed vibe and the decor. The people were all kind and we liked the pool. The beach was very small, but that was ok. 

Minor thing, but not having towels at the beach was crazy. And not having bins to bring your towels back to is also nuts. Bringing them to ebb and flow every time to get them and then return is inconvenient and wouldn’t be a big deal to put some towel bins out like they do at the Disney world resorts. 

We also were in a room that was super loud and felt like there was no soundproofing. I could hear scraping of what sounded like chairs CONSTANTLY all morning and night. I heard a c-pap machine through the vent so must’ve been the person directly above us, the beds were BRUTALLY hard and we had back problems after sleeping on them

And we were placed in a handicapped
Room  with a terrible shower head and all of the hanging rods, etc. were wheelchair height. We were right next to the Green Cabin - like to the point where we could say hello to the people on the deck and have a convo. It was super loud until 10pm which was hard with a kiddo. That part can be handled with room placement. 

But, the toughest thing we noticed was the service was not Disney-level. The staff was nice and all, but they were incredibly slow … I mean incredibly slow. All food services were terrible to the point where they’d box up some of the food and we’d be waiting forever for the last parts. So the fries would be cold because we’d be waiting forever for a grilled cheese (as example). And this happened with everything. We didn’t get anything complicated - a turkey sandwich, grilled cheese and fries. Then a burger, chicken fingers, fries, and nice cream. In the morning we’d get coffee and a croissant and by the time the warmed croissant was heated, the latte would be cold. 

Other people asked about food allergy menus and they ran around not knowing what to do. Where to find one or what to ask the chef. 

It just seemed like they weren’t trained and were just dropped in there one day being told to figure it out. 

Absolutely not their fault, but I do blame resort management. 

Anyway, my question is, for those who go to Vero regularly, is this an anomaly or par for the course? 

Trying to decide if I want to give it another go in the future or not.

I’m an Ethiopian coffee producer and exporter, and I’m currently exploring ways to connect with US based roasters and green coffee professionals.

We have specialty Guji green coffee already imported, customs cleared, and stored in Atlanta, Georgia. The volume can be broken into flexible lot sizes, which may suit small to mid size roasters.

I’m not posting this as a direct sales ad. I’d genuinely appreciate guidance on: How roasters typically prefer to source small specialty lots already in the US. 
Whether working through a local broker or agent is usually the best approach.

as 2025 comes to an end, it feels like the right time to sit down with a good cup of coffee and say a very big thank you. This year was intense in terms of development, releases, and community interactions, and BeanConqueror would simply not exist in this form without all of you.

Over the past twelve months, BeanConqueror went through a full series of releases, from 8.0 at the very start of the year all the way to 8.5 at the end. 8.0 completed the move from Cordova to Capacitor and delivered a lot of performance work under the hood, while the later 8.1–8.4 updates built on that foundation with new features, UI refinements, and bug fixes that made everyday use smoother and more reliable. The final release, 8.5, wrapped up 2025 with additional polishing and some small “gifts” that many of you had requested over time.

In terms of features, 2025 was packed. Bean freezing and thawing, one of the most requested topics in the community alongside synchronization (which was not touched this year), is now properly supported, making it easier to manage frozen portions and keep track of what was thawed when. Bean handling in general became much more powerful, with better sorting by dates and remaining weight, automatic selection of frozen beans when needed, improved bean imports including images, and more flexible ways to keep your stock organized.

On the brewing and device side, this year brought a lot of new integrations and refinements. Support for Gaggiuino, including shot importing, opened up new workflows for people running this on their machines, and work on Sanremo YOU integration started to appear in the wild, including in some YouTube videos that showcased BeanConqueror as part of advanced setups. Several new Bluetooth scales and sensors joined the lineup over the year, from commercial scales like Varia models and Half Decent Scale to DIY projects like EspressiScale, WeighMyBruh, and others, alongside continuous improvements to pressure-based autostart, flow-rate handling, and stability for existing devices.

Brewing itself gained multiple quality-of-life improvements in 2025. It became possible to filter brews by used water, show water flow peak rate in the detail view, and choose which photo, bean, brew, or preparation, to show by default. Espresso workflows benefited from fixes to weight doubling, camera behavior, and taring logic, as well as new options like stopping brews at a predefined pressure threshold and tuning graph refresh rates for lower-performance devices. On top of that, the statistics page has gotten some improvements.

The app itself also got more comfortable to live in. Dark Mode finally arrived as an experimental feature, with options to choose light or dark, or simply follow the system theme. Settings saw new toggles such as automatically saving brews, disabling connect and disconnect pop-ups for Bluetooth devices, and adjusting graph update intervals to match a wide range of phones and tablets. Behind the scenes, large framework updates, Capacitor and Angular, ensured that BeanConqueror remains maintainable and ready for future work.

All of this development is only half the story though. The other half is what you did with it. Wrapped 2025 again showed how actively BeanConqueror is used, with hundreds of thousands of brews, tens of thousands of beans and grinders, water recipes, and more being logged over the year, giving a glimpse into how diverse the global coffee community really is. There were people celebrating their 1,000th tracked brew, others sharing their yearly coffee reviews, and many explaining how tracking helped them learn, experiment, and improve.

BeanConqueror is now used in 153 countries, which is still a mind-bending number for an open-source, offline-first project maintained alongside a full-time job. Two more languages are already in the ramp-up for 2026, pushing the app further towards being accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of where they live or which language they feel most comfortable using. This global reach is possible only because people keep recommending the app in conversations, comments, and threads whenever someone asks how to track their coffee.

A massive thank you goes to all translators. Bringing BeanConqueror into so many languages is a tremendous amount of work and requires both precision and care. Over the past years and especially in 2024–2025, more languages have been added or extended, and the translation system has matured to make collaboration easier. This work is often behind the scenes but has a huge impact, it lowers barriers, respects local communities, and makes sure people do not have to “fight the UI” in a foreign language just to log their brews.

Another big thank you goes to everyone who contributed code, testing, ideas, or technical feedback. A special shoutout goes to RagingCactus for the massive work on shifting from Cordova to Capacitor at the start of the year, fixing all the Android-side issues, and continuing to support throughout 2025. The project's GitHub, issue tracker, and release notes show how much work went into making 8.0–8.5 stable and feature-rich, and how many people invested their time to help debug hard edge cases or polish details.

Beyond the code, a lot of energy in 2025 went into simply being present. Questions, bug reports, and feature ideas came in through many channels, Discord, Reddit, forums, Telegram groups, emails, Instagram, and Facebook, and each of these requires reading, understanding, replying, and often following up with testing or documentation. Balancing this with a full-time job and ongoing development means evenings, weekends, and early mornings are regularly invested into answering messages, preparing posts, updating FAQs, and keeping discussions constructive and respectful. This is time-intensive work, but it is also what keeps BeanConqueror connected to the real needs of the people using it every day.

If you shared a screenshot of your brew graph, filed a bug report, mentioned BeanConqueror in a comment, created a video, added a translation string, or simply said “thank you” in a DM this year, it made a difference. The project grows because people care, challenge ideas, and still remain kind and constructive. That combination is rare and deeply appreciated.

Thank you for being part of this journey through 2025, for your patience, your curiosity, your feedback, and your passion for good coffee. Here is to a 2026 with even more learning, more features, more languages, and many great cups of coffee.

Have a great cup of coffee

1pzriu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1pzriu6/an_update_for_my_fellow_anxiety_folks/,An update for my fellow anxiety folks,"I made a post a few days ago panicking about both my surgery itself and the enema they wanted me to do the night before, and now, on the other side of both, I'm here to report that I survived. This is frankly shocking to me because my brain definitely had me convinced I was going to die on the operating table, or not wake up from the anesthesia, or be in excruciating pain afterward. I almost canceled the whole thing. This was my first ever surgery and my first ever anesthetic, and it was all so much easier than anticipated, as is often the way with severe anxiety.

I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm definitely uncomfortable. It took me twice as long as normal to make coffee this morning, and I immediately went back to bed with it and haven't gotten up since. Rolling out of bed is something I have to work myself up to doing every time because it hurts so much, and I'm walking around everywhere cradling a pillow against my stomach because I feel like my guts are going to fall out onto the floor. I keep coughing and having to clear mucus out of my throat, presumably from the breathing tube, which hurts my poor abused abdomen every time. I still haven't pooped and the gas pains are real, though I don't have them in my shoulder like others have.

But here's the important thing. None of this is as bad as i had worked myself up to thinking it would be. I opted to take the Versed when they offered it to me and I'm glad I did, because I remember nothing from about five minutes after that to waking up in recovery. My pain hasn't gone over a 4 or 5 yet and all I'm taking is extra strength Tylenol. I did wake up from the anesthesia having a panic attack, shaking pretty hard and gasping for breath, but it didn't last long and I was fine after they gave me a little something to calm me down. My appetite returned almost immediately and I had no nausea after the first few minutes, and I haven't experienced the extreme fatigue I've seen some people mention, though I live with chronic fatigue anyway so I might not notice. I had a total robotic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and while they were in there, they discovered a cyst the size of a grapefruit on one of my ovaries that I had no idea was there, so it's a good thing I went through with it.

I know people usually post here with their problems and negative experiences, which is natural because they're seeking support, so I wanted to give this update to say that if you, like me, suffer from severe anxiety, especially if it involves a fear of not being in control of your own brain/body, you're going to get through it. If I can do it, you can do it. I'm not in the best shape or the best of health generally. We're all capable of more than we think we are and we can all survive hard things. Most of us already have, hence the reason for these procedures.

I live alone with two cats, and while my mom lives 7 minutes away and I have a local friend coming to help with the litter boxes, I'm doing most things on my own, so be prepared for another update in the coming days wailing about how hard everything is. This is only the first day after the procedure. I'm expecting things to get worse before they get better. But now I can say I did it, and since I made it through the surgery itself and all that surrounds it, I'm confident I'm going to make it through recovery even if it sucks and I hate everything for a while.",7,1767123429.0,hysterectomy,2,0.9,False

26M, 170cm

I maintained a healthy weight until the first wave of COVID hit. Afterward, my health began to decline; I gained weight and felt physically weak. Contracting COVID during the second wave too, sent me into a further downward spiral, added by the stress of life decisions.

Eventually, things began to improve, and I set out to lose weight. It has been a challenge, however; my weight rose from 72kg in 2021 to a peak of 88kg. I wasn’t working and was working from home.

But then I felt bad for myself, I never was this fat/unhealthy. Well thats when in September 2024, I started a consistent workout routine and saw real progress, dropping down to 80kg.

Unfortunately, due to work commitments, I regained some of that weight and am currently sitting between 84–85kg.

For over a month now, I’ve been working out regularly again, but the scale won't budge—I can’t even seem to lose 0.5kg per week.

My routine involves weight training five to six days a week (Push/Pull/Legs) along with cycling. Despite this, and keeping my diet strictly consistent for the past month, I’m seeing no results.

My typical daily intake: has been same since one month now, which includes:

Breakfast: One slice of white bread with 25g of butter, 150ml of tea, and five boiled eggs (two whole, three whites).

Lunch: Usually a protein shake thats it.

Dinner: Five eggs (one whole, four whites), 400–600g of rice, and vegetables/pulses, sometimes chicken(2-3 chest pieces)

I regularly consume black coffee approx 400ml.

Sometimes chia seeds in water too.

I’m not sure where I’m going wrong or what is stalling my progress. It’s becoming a major source of stress, and I’m looking for advice on where to focus my efforts.

I recently just purchased a Breville Barista Express Espresso machine and (according to my reddit research) any first time espresso machine owner will tell you the most tedious/hardest part is dialing in your machine properly to get the best espresso pull possible. To my understanding the espresso pull is dependent on MANY things (i’ve spent a lot of time reading r/espresso posts, so please spare me any additional info), including the beans used and the process of grinding them. 

Anyways, I recently purchased some of my favorite beans from Blanchards (Beartrap Espresso). I was wondering if anybody here also uses these beans and a Breville machine, and could tell me the grind size/grind amount settings they use on their machine to get the most perfect pull possible. I am trying not to waste my beans on subpar pulls and i’m clearly very impatient so i’m turning here for answers. In my research, I’ve also come across people saying the machine itself also affects the pull, therefore, I’d like these responses to kind of be a jumping off point for my espresso journey. I sound like a noob, but really destined to make the best cup of joe I can. 

Also, if anybody uses any other variation of Blanchards beans, or any other local roasteries, PLEASE feel free to comment the type of beans and grind size/grind amount settings you use for those beans since I am a very restless beginner and would like to continue supporting local roasteries in the richmond area as i endeavor on my own espresso journey.

1pzr9uu,https://i.redd.it/i0drrbhi7eag1.jpeg,"Two Years, One Trip, and a Moment That Changed Everything","I met her at a friend’s birthday party in Bengaluru about two years ago. She worked with him. Smart, quick with her jokes, easy to talk to. The kind of person who made conversations feel lighter without trying too hard. We ended up on the terrace at some point, rain falling steadily, the city glowing below us while people drifted in and out. We talked about work, music, nothing important. It still felt important. We exchanged numbers before leaving.

By the next day, we were already texting like this was not the beginning of something, but the continuation of it.

The first year was easy in the way only new relationships are. She had a solid job that kept her busy but fulfilled. I had my routines, my half baked cooking experiments, my playlists. We liked the same binge worthy shows and sent each other reels instead of good morning texts. Dates were unremarkable in the best way. Filter coffee at small cafes that turned into long walks. Lazy Sunday breakfasts at old school places where time slowed down. Sometimes we would sit next to each other with our own earphones, listening to the same playlist, not talking, perfectly fine with that.

There was no rush. No dramatic declarations. Just consistency. Months passed, then a year, and it felt natural to plan further ahead. Vacations, festivals, weddings of mutual friends. We learned how the other handled bad days, family stress, missed calls, long work weeks. We argued occasionally, resolved it quietly, moved on.

About a year and a half in, I took her home for a family festival. My mother insisted she eat more sweets than anyone reasonably should. My father repeated his usual terrible jokes. She laughed in the right places, helped in the kitchen without being asked, and fit in without trying too hard. That meant more to me than anything else. On the train ride back, she leaned against my shoulder and said she had a good time. That was when the thought settled in properly. This could be it.

We sometimes spoke about marriage the way couples do. Someday. Eventually. Not now but yes. We talked about kids in abstract terms, about where we would like to live if work allowed it. Nothing detailed, nothing serious, nothing urgent enough to feel heavy.

Sometime after that, I began saving quietly. Fewer cabs, more buses. Cooking at home, cutting back wherever I could. It felt oddly satisfying. Like I was building toward something solid. After a few months, I bought a simple ring. Nothing too flashy. Just something that felt right.

I planned a weekend trip to Coorg. Coffee estates lush after the rains, air that felt lighter, a quiet homestay tucked into the hills. She seemed tired in the weeks leading up to it, distracted sometimes when work came up, but I assumed it was just another busy phase. We had both had those.

The trip itself was perfect. We walked through plantations, took too many photos, talked about nothing and everything. That evening, we drove up to a small viewpoint as the sun dipped behind the trees. The light softened. The moment felt ready.

When it got quiet, I pulled out the ring. I dropped to one knee, stumbled through what I had planned to say, and asked her to marry me.

She did not respond immediately. She just stood there, eyes fixed somewhere past me, wearing a half smile that did not quite reach her eyes.

Then she said no.

For a moment, neither of us moved. The ring was still in my hand. My ears were ringing. She finally spoke again, her voice unsteady. She said she had accepted a relocation offer from her company’s California office earlier that week. It had been in discussion for months, interviews and internal approvals dragging on, and she had not believed it would actually happen until it did. Huge pay jump. Dream project. Full relocation. Leaving next month.

She said she did not know how to tell me. That the trip was meant to be a pause before everything changed. The laugh came later, nervous and brief, more release than relief. She apologized more times than I can remember. She said marrying me and leaving immediately felt wrong. Staying back felt impossible.

We did not fight. There was nothing to fight about.

She offered to cover the cost of the ring, said it felt unfair to let me carry that on top of everything else. I returned it back to the jeweller and got refund. A week later, I booked the solo Thailand trip I had been postponing for years with that money.

I am writing this from a beach in Thailand. Bare feet in the sand, fresh seafood on the plate, the sea stretching endlessly ahead. My playlist is playing loud through my own speakers. No sharing required.

Some days still sting. Certain songs still catch me off guard. But life keeps moving, whether you are ready or not. And sometimes a no is not the end of the story. It is just life quietly redirecting you.

But how do I start again?

1pzr8j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pzr8j2/prophetic_pages_part_1/,Prophetic Pages (Part 1),"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2023""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2023""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it?"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man"".

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1767122771.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’ve made it a bit of a New Year’s resolution to get out more, meet new people, and break out of the lonely rut I’ve been in the last few months. I’ve tried looking online, but most things seem to be on weekday evenings, which doesn’t really work for me as I usually get home pretty late from work.
I work full time Monday to Friday, 9–5, so I’m mainly looking for stuff that happens on Saturdays or Sundays. I’m honestly just trying to escape the whole eat–sleep–work–repeat loop and be a bit more social.
I’m 25M and would be interested in things like:
Anything history related – I’m a big history nerd and love chatting about it
Gaming stuff – video games, tabletop, anything really
Maybe a DnD or card game group – never played before but I’m up for giving it a go
If anyone knows where I can find groups like this, or has any suggestions, I’d really appreciate it.

Maybe if someone wants to grab a coffee together one afternoon or morning in the city id be open to that too, just drop me a message and leat organise something in the new year :)

**CHAPTER 001: A Woman Named Ichinose Yui**

  


**1st Year of University, Spring.**



Peeking out from beneath the collar of her loungewear T-shirt, the red mark on her shoulder stood out in a clear contrast against her pale-white skin.



And it would only take someone a few minutes of time to realize that the red mark was not a scar or mark at all, but rather someone's bite mark.



I slowly crept up to Yui-san, who was currently leaning against the sofa while being engrossed in a movie that was playing on the TV's large screen, and I secretly peered at the bright mark from across the couch.



Uwaah, that looks really painful. Not to mention that this bite mark was not there when she left the house yesterday.



So this bite mark must have been a fresh one, most probably having been made last night. After all, Yui-san did not come home last night.



Exactly how good must sex feel for someone to make them want to bite their partner so hard that it would leave a lasting mark like that?



I tried to imagine how her night with someone else must have gone, but my imagination was only able to get me so far. But the undeniable fact still remained: last night, someone whom she held in her arms sank their teeth into her shoulder hard enough to leave a bright red mark on her pale skin.



「Say, doesn't it hurt you? This thing right here?」



「Hm?」



I asked as I poked the red, swollen bite mark with my fingertip, but Yui-san quickly covered it with her hand.



「…… It actually DOES hurt a little bit, so please don't touch it.」



Her eyebrows then frowned in a slight display of displeasure. Her long, black hair slid lightly over her shoulders, and she stared straight back at me with her beautiful face now tainted with a reproachful expression.



「I mean, it looks really painful and swollen, that mark. Not to mention that it really stands out.」



「No need to worry about that. It's going to fade away on its own in a couple of days, anyways.」



「I guess so, but it looks really painful. Aren't you mad at the person who left it on you?」



「It was not strong enough of a bite to draw any blood, so I don't really feel mad about it. But I won't lie, it really hurt, so I might not allow that kind of thing to be done to me again.」



She said with a mischievous laugh escaping from her lips.



Yui-san is a woman, and she likes other women. She's what's known in this world as a homosexual. A lesbian.



But the thing is, the person who happened to bite Yui-san so hard that it left a mark behind was not her lover.



It took me less than a month to actually realize that fact about her.



On the days when Yui-san did not come home for the night, she was always hanging out at some other woman's house, and then at dawn, the lingering scent of her perfume, which she'd been wearing when she would leave for the night, would disappear.



At first, I thought that she might have had an actual boyfriend. I also assumed that the reason as to why she was staying overnight somewhere else was because of my sudden arrival at this place as her housemate, so she could no longer invite her lover over to spend the night here.



That is, until I saw her kissing another woman in the open at a drinking party that was supposed to be a social gathering for students from the same department.



It was not that Yui-san had tried to hide her homosexuality, but she was also a well-known womanizer at university.



「Seriously though, at this rate someone is really going to stab you one of these days.」



「Now, now,enough about me and my habits. Come on now, why don't you come over here? Let's watch a movie together, shall we?」



It was always like this with her. Whenever I tried to get into a more in-depth conversation with her about something, she would always skillfully dodge my question.



Faced with her constant beckoning, I finally spun around to the sofa and sat down right next to Yui-san, who quickly draped a blanket over my lap, showing just how experienced she was with handling women.



Yui-san then picked up the remote control from the coffee table and stopped the movie that was playing with a click of a button.



「Huh? What's this? Weren't we supposed to watch a movie together?」



「Yes, that's right, and that's what we are going to do. However, Kanata, you can choose a movie that you'd like to watch. I'll go get us some drinks in the meantime.」



""Here you go,"" she said while handing me the remote control. She must have been right in the middle of the movie, but even so Yui-san headed to the kitchen while humming a lovely tune, not really paying that much attention to the rest of the movie's story.



This house came equipped with a professional surround system and a projector, like those on display in an expensive electronics store, and they were the only things in this house, which was far too spacious and impersonal for one person to live in, that gave off a sense of Yui-san's ""favorite things.""



Yui-san was the kind of person who really enjoyed her movies. That was one of the facts about her that I could say that I knew for sure.



But apart from that single fact, there was actually next to nothing that I knew about her.



We were both attending the same university, but she was a third-year student and I was the first-year student, which meant that Yui-san was two years older than me. She also happened to be left-handed.



She much rather preferred coffee to tea, and her favorite drink was a highball.



She was unable to cook her own meals, but she could do housework just fine, and her house was all neat and tidy, with nothing unnecessary cluttering its space.



The reason as to why she was living all alone in such a fine, single-story house in the center of Tokyo was because she was the daughter of the CEO of one of Japan's leading conglomerates.



Yui-san's father was currently serving as the company's president, and surprisingly enough, he also happened to be a friend of my father's from his college days.



That was exactly how it became possible for me to live in this house in the first place.



But even after all this time of us living together, even if I would try to rock my mind really hard, I still only knew this little about Yui-san.



CLICK.



I was startled and brought back to reality from the world of my own thoughts by the sight of hot milk placed on top of the coffee table in front of me.



「Here you go.」



「Thank you very much.」



As I put the mug cup to my lips and took a sip out of it, the subtle aroma and sweetness of honey spread throughout my mouth.



Back in March, when I'd just started staying with Yui-san, I'd returned to Japan alone from England, where my family lived, to continue my studies, and she would make me some hot milk just like this every single night.



Back then, she seemed like a kind, reliable older sister type to me.



Honestly, back then I would never even be able to imagine that she was a lesbian, and on top of that, that she had such a completely twisted view of romance in the first place. Thinking this, I glanced at Yui-san out of the corner of my eye.



「Have you decided what you want to watch yet?」



「…… Umm, how about this one? The one with a dog in it?」



I pointed to the image of a dog that was displayed on the screen in the otherwise dimly lit room. I only then started to wonder if Yui-san might not actually like that kind of thing.



It's been two months since I have started living together with her. And in that amount of time I have come to understand firsthand just how lenient and accommodating she could be when it comes to women. She would always make sure to accommodate their slightest whims.



「Oh, are you perhaps a dog person? Sure thing, let's watch this one today.」



Yui-san took the remote control and pressed the play button.



At the same time, I pulled the blanket a little bit closer to myself and draped it over my shoulders.



「Hm? What's wrong? Are you cold?」



Noticing my actions, Yui-san gently put an arm around my shoulders. I could feel her body heat as we pressed together against each other, which was actually kind of comforting. The warmth of her skin helped to dispel my feeling of creeping loneliness.



I'm sure tha she'd be even more gentle with me if I actually happened to be her lover.



I remember that she once said to me that she was ""not all that kin on having a lover,"" but that was just because she did not want to bother with that. What a waste that was. Of course, she was such an incredibly beautiful person, so it was only natural that she'd never run out of potential partners and suitors.



But in her eyes, perhaps it would be a ""waste"" if she was to limit herself to having just a single lover.



As for me, I could not possibly understand what it would feel like to be in love with another woman. I have never even dared to try and imagine it.



Her hand, which held me close to her body, gently stroked my hair, playing with the ends of my hair.



I honestly thought that it was probably because she would do those kinds of things so naturally with everyone that so many women would fall for her.



「......Yui-san, why are you so popular with other people even though you are being so dishonest?」



Ahaha, Yui-san only laughed upon hearing my question. And truth to be told, I have actually long since realized why she was being so popular with other people.



I just could not help myself but to want to pin the blame on this person, since he was someone towards whom I could not help but to naturally gravitate towards.



「Who knows? Even I do not know what's so good or desirable about someone such as myself.」



Even though I said those words in an accusing tone, she just smiled at me and did n'ot seem to care all that much, which only served to fuel my own confusion even further.



Was that kind of behavior supposed to be normal?



Spending the night together with someone so casually even though you were not lovers? Was that what college students are all like deep down inside?



「Say, Kanata? Do you have a sweetheart yourself?」



I looked at Yui-san, surprised by the belated question. Ever since I started living together with her, I'd never stayed out overnight. I thought she'd noticed that since ages ago.



「I do not. Besides, you've seen the kind of lifestyle I've had for a while now, so I thought you'd notice…...」



「Oh, so that's it, huh? Personally, I think that you are very lovely and cute, so I was sure that you had a lover. I simply thought that you were in a long-distance relationship, that's all.」



「......I WAS in a relationship before, but he cheated on me and then I decided to dump him.」



Even now, when I was thinking about it, my heart would still ache with a surge of stinging pain. I had no regrets about ending that relationship, but it still managed to leave a deep wound in my heart that seemed to tear it apart.



That incident was actually one of the reasons as to why I chose to study at a Japanese university, but I still did not have the courage to complain about it or to tell anyone about it to anyone.



「He cheated on you? Then breaking up with him was the right thing to do. Good for you.」



「Are you really sure that someone as unfaithful and fickle as you has any right to say stuff like that, Yui-san?」



I couldn't help myself but to laugh at my words as I pointed that fact out. For someone as unfaithful as Yui-san, she had no right to lecture anyone about matters of fidelity.



「Personally, I wouldn't really call my behavior and actions cheating. I mean, I do not have a girlfriend in the first place, so I don't have anyone on whom I CAN cheat.」



「I don't know and see the difference here. Is there really no one in this world who can just love one person wholeheartedly and honestly, devoting their entire being to that one person alone?」



I was really glad that I chose a heartwarming animal movie for us to watch for today. It helped to soothe my frayed heart a great deal.



Dogs really are great. They love their owners so wholeheartedly, and they would never ever betray them. Am I being greedy for wanting such a devoted love from another person?



But that being said, I don't really want a lover who's like a dog.



「You are pretty cute, Kanata, so I think that you are going to land yourself a wonderful boyfriend in no time at all.」



「You say that, Yui-san, but surely you do not think that. …… For starters, I am not even someone who would be your type, aren't I?」



「...… And when did I ever say such a thing?」



「Maybe it was not word for word, but you DID say something really similar to that. It was right after we first started living together.」



I still remembered the exact words that Yui-san said to me, sounding all apologetically, with a frown of her brows, as if to admonish me after I'd panicked upon learning that she was a lesbian.



""-- You can rest assured. I am not just going after any woman that I happen to lay my eyes upon. So you can relax. I'm sorry for keeping quiet about it.""



I'm sure that she said those words to me in order to reassure me, but it also meant that she did not consider me to be someone whom he could target as her potential partner.



That was actually fine in and out of itself. I was not a lesbian to begin with, and I have already decided to live at Yui-san's house during my time at college, so it was going to be far better if something like that did not happen to me.



And even though I kept on telling myself that over and over again…… Somehow, I felt really bad with that knowledge.



「When we first started living together, Kanata, you were like a little kitten that was not used to the coman of other people.」



Yui-san said it so suddenly and so completely out of the blue that I could almost hear the sound of a huge question mark popping right above my head.



「A kitten, you say?」



「You finally let me touch you, and it's only after two months, right? You were so wary of me at first.」



「…… It's nothing, really. It's simply that it's cold today, and that is why I do not mind you clinging to me for the time being.」



「If that's so, then how about I turn the AC some more for you?」



Her dark eyes stared really intently at me, and my gaze wandered around, unsure of how I should respond to that.



I knew that I should just move away and put some distance between us. But there was also a part of me that did not want to let go of this gentle and pleasant warmth.



She must have known that. That I was feeling all homesick and lonely.



「…… You can be quite a meanie sometimes, huh, Yui-san?」



「Is that so?」



「And the fact that you yourself do not even realize it makes it even worse…...」



「I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just kidding. I'm just really happy that you seem to have grown so attached to me, Kanata.」



Yui-san said as she playfully tickled my neck, and it was then that I realized that she was simply making fun of me. I then pulled her hand away and glared at her, to which Yui-san laughed and giggled once again.



Yui-san was just like a cloud. She was unpredictable, she was all fluffy, and it was like she'd disappear somewhere before I even knew it.



But I was actually enjoying this kind of evening together that we had going on for the moment, so much so that I was completely captivated by the sweet, comforting warm milk and leaned into her shoulder some more. 



All of a sudden, as if interrupting this little moment of relaxation and bliss that we were sharing, Yui-san's smartphone, which was sitting on top of the coffee table, rang out loud.



It was the name of an unfamiliar woman that was displayed on the phone's screen. Yui-san cast a quick glance at it and then she quickly tapped the mute button.



「Are you sure about it, Yui-san? About not answering?」



「Mhm, yeah, I'm sure. It's fine for the time being. I will call her back later, provided that I will feel like doing it.」



She said this with a disinterested look on her face and flipped her phone over, which somehow made me feel a bit annoyed. As revenge for what she'd done to me earlier, I felt the sudden urge to be a little bit mean to her on my own.



「Was that perhaps the one who gave you that bite mark, Yui-san?」



「Who knows? I already forgot all about it.」



You liar, I thought to myself as I pinched the hand that was still being placed on top of my shoulder.



A lone night in May. Leaving home, it was the start of my new college life, filled with much worry and anxiety.



It all began when I met the kind, and yet so mean, and lying Yui-san.

1pzqxzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/volvoc40/comments/1pzqxzy/c40_recharge_inverter_setup_for_v2h/,C40 recharge inverter setup for V2H,"After a little windstorm, we had a power outage last night, and temps dropping below freezing.  I have backfed my house during such outages before using 4 different EVs: 1 Gen 1 LEAF, 1 Gen 1 Volt, and 2 Bolt EVs. Often up to several days.

I had not yet done so with the 2022 C40 Ultimate Recharge Twin (Fjord Blue) I got a few months ago.

Looking at this forum gave a lot a pause.  I did it anyway.  :)

DISCLAIMER: If you do not understand electricity or basic safety concepts, do not attempt this.  I am an engineer, and am very careful with this setup.

The setup:  I have a 2.0 kW 120VAC sine wave inverter hooked up to two very heavy duty 'jumper cable' like clamps with 200A wiring (and a 250A inline fuse).  The clamps get attached to the 12V system of the car when it is in 'READY' mode, so the on board DC-DC converter is supplying 12V (this is verified by seeing 14.4V on the 12V wire).

I assume that the DC-DC can supply \~1100W continuous, or about 1000W out (max) at 120VAC. The inverter is Chinese and cost about $150.  For surge power requirements, the 12V battery will provide a little extra buffer current.  I take care to not use more than 1000W for long enough periods to pull down the 12V.

The challenge on the C40 is getting it to stay in READY.  On other EVs, one just applies the parking brake, puts the car in 'N' and exits out the passenger side door.  The other EVs will stay in N forever.  I tried the C40 awhile back, and it popped out of N after 40 mins IIRC.  This is 'risky' bc under load the 12V battery can be quickly discharged (although the inverter should shut off before the 12V is permanently damaged).

With the car in N, one chocks the wheels for safety in case the brake releases (as it might if the 12V went dead).

Today, with the C40, I chocked the wheels forward and back.  I arranged a stick to hold down the brake pedal (since we do not have emergency brake control), and put it in 'D'.  I also put a 50 lb sand bag in the driver seat, and exited out the passenger side.

The C40 stays in D for 60 minutes, then shifts to P.  So I set an alarm on my phone to shift it back to D every 59 minutes, which I do reaching in through the window.  NBD.

The car is in my attached 'tuck under' garage.  Very nice in blizzard or hurricane conditions.

I take the output of the inverter and backfeed it into my house panel (with suitable safety interlock), driving both 120V legs of the panel in phase (the typical 2-phase 120/240V setup in the US).  240V appliances see no power (I switch all the 240V breakers off anyway).  And voila, all the 120V plugs and appliances in my house work, up to 1 kW continuous total, and 2 kW surge.  My house runs about 300-600W in practice.  I can make K-cup coffee, but I can't use the microwave, the dishwasher or the laundry.

I get space heat by firing up a wood stove.  Its nice to have 120 to run the blower on the stove.  I cook on a portable propane stove.  My hot water is in an insulated tank, good for several showers.

C40 Details: I had to remove the dress covers under the hood, the ones to the right (drivers side) of the frunck.  One presses in the center of the retaining clips and they pop right out.  It was a little fussy, but I was able to access the 12V pretty easily.

An earlier forum post warned that there is a big $$$ fuse on the 12V battery that one can blow doing this.  I looked up the wiring diagram for the C40, and the fuse is on the negative 'return' side, and clearly intended for a rare case where the 12V battery shorts out.  This is common on the other EVs I have used for this... the solution is to NEVER attach a load to the negative terminal of the 12V battery.

One clips inverter + to the + terminal on the 12V, and inverter - to chassis ground.  I use the shiny metal case of a nearby electronics box. (much of the chassis is painted).

Did I have any problems?  None.  I didn't feel like pushing it (so no K-cup coffee today), and probably only pulled 250-500W for about 4 hours.  The power came back on 6 hours earlier than predicted.

So, the C40 is a bit more of a PITA than the other EVs I have used, but works as expected.  I have a cheapo 300Wh battery bank for short outages (say less than a 6 hours).  For longer outages (I have had some that last for several days), taking 10 mins to set up the C40 for V2H is not a big deal.

And I can live with the 59 minute reset alarm on my phone.  :/",2,1767122092.0,volvoc40,0,1.0,False

A week ago I came across iA writer. It looked really nice… until I saw the $50 price tag. I was like ""I can build this myself bro 😭""

So I did.

Called it **write0.** Free, fully client-side, web-based distraction-free writing app.

* Clean, minimal markdown editor with focus mode
* Style checking (very bare bones for now)
* Live preview
* Export as .md, PDF or HTML
* Runs entirely in the browser (no accounts, no servers, no data leaving your machine)

Why I built it:

* I wanted something like iA Writer, but free and accessible
* I wanted it to run purely in the browser
* And I wanted it to be open source so others can extend it

Try the app out [here](http://write.omarbadri.dev) or checkout the [github repo](https://github.com/omarbdri/write0).

It’s still evolving, and I’m very open to feedback, feature ideas, and contributions.  
If you’re a writer, developer, or just someone who enjoys clean tools, I’d love to hear what you think.

My belief in God didn’t disappear; it became more personal, less performative, and no longer rooted in fear or worthiness checklists. Just a deeper appreciation for the good all around me. 

I learned how to appreciate people who believe differently than I do without needing to measure them—or myself—against some invisible standard. I no longer felt like I had to be “right” for my life to have meaning. And more importantly I came to terms with the nonsense of Mormons thinking they are right, while everyone else to have ever lived on this planet was wrong.

It gave me time—an extra day each week to rest, to breathe, to be with my family, to be outdoors without guilt sitting in the back of my mind. Sunday = fun day!

But most of all, it relieved a weight I didn’t realize I was carrying. The constant pressure to be perfect. The quiet shame of never quite measuring up. Worrying about what my neighbors thought. What calling I had. All that nonsense. The habit of hiding small, harmless parts of myself—like drinking coffee—because others would question my beliefs.

Leaving allowed me to stop hiding. To stop apologizing for being human. To finally be honest with myself, and to live in a way that feels whole instead of managed. Thank God I got out.  The past ten years of my life have been the best ten years!",25,1767121898.0,exmormon,30,0.96,False

Prologue

It was Monday morning, 6:00 A.M. The inhabitants of Beech View Townhouses were still slumbering peacefully, and there was a beautiful sunrise for anyone already awake to enjoy. It was the type of atmosphere where one would imagine Grieg’s “Morning Mood” to be playing if it were a Merrie Melodies skit. Very peaceful. Very serene.

And with a ***CRASH!*** the tranquility was over. The jolted-awake residents of the small townhouse complex then heard two distinct voices, one of a determined stepmother and the other of a defiant, voice-cracking adolescent, arguing loudly.

“I DON’T *WANT* EGGS FOR BREAKFAST! ***YOU CAN’T MAKE ME!”***

“YOU’LL *EAT* ‘EM AND ***LIKE*** ‘EM!”

*THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP* ***SLAM!*** The boy went sprinting out the front door, with a plate of eggs flying past his head and crashing into a nearby tree. The stepmother, still in her bathrobe and slippers, chased after him, but stopped at the end of the driveway, shaking her fist and screaming ultimatums. After her ungrateful stepspawn disappeared around the corner, she stalked back inside, straightening her hairpins and grumbling.

Once the daily show was over, the rubberneckers closed their windows and went back to their daily business.


**Chapter One**

Clark Simmons stomped into his first-period classroom and sat down heavily at his desk with a sour look on his face. That wench… why did it always have to be *eggs?* He was sick and tired of them! He did feel bad about making such a fuss about it, but to be fair, he wouldn’t have to if she didn’t keep on shoving them in his face like she did… He put the eggs aside from his mind and tried to pay attention to his math teacher, but to no avail. His focus drifted back to his stepmother. She had been on his back a lot more lately, ever since his birthday in September two months ago. Always asking him weird questions about doing drugs, his social media use, the friends he hung out with… One would think that now he was sixteen, she would give him more autonomy and trust. It wasn’t like he was doing drugs, or even had any social media accounts, or had any friends to hang out with.

Stupid eggs…


**Chapter Two**

I'm F.V. Carter, private eye. I had just hung up the horn with the unemployment agency when a broad entered my office.

”Are you a private detective?” she asked.
I replied that I was. We bumped gums for a while, and then she asked about my price.

”Twenty bucks, cash,” I said. ”If you can't fork over the dough, then breeze.”

The dame looked surprised, then gave me the up-and-down, as if I was goofy or something. Finally she gave me the mazuma, and told me her deal. She wanted me to tail her son.

“I’m worried that he’s hanging out with the wrong kind of people. He acts so secretive these days,” she jawed. “I need you to follow him and tell me if he gets up to anything illegal.”

“Eggs in the coffee.”

She gave me that funny look again, and dusted out. Honestly. It’s not like I’m crazy or anything. I know how to do my job, even if this *is* my first gig. I listen to Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar all the time. This sort of thing is duck soup!


**Chapter Three**

As Clark headed home, he began to get the funny feeling as if he was being watched. He kept on seeing odd shadows out of the corner of his eye, and hearing sticks crunching behind him as he walked through the shortcut. One time he looked behind him and saw a bush shaking, as if somebody had leapt inside it just as he began to turn around. He was too scared to check, though, and he ran all the rest of the way home.

The next day, he found a strange man hiding behind a telephone pole too narrow to conceal him.

“Are you following me?” Clark demanded, to which the man replied “You’re tooting the wrong ringer, see!” and ran off.

The horrible feeling got worse and worse as the week continued, and Clark began to fear for his life, and also doubt his sanity. What if this was all his imagination? Still, he decided to play it safe and find a new path to and from school. He made it as complicated as he could, weaving through alleyways, hiding behind garbage cans, and cutting through backyards to try to get the stalker off his trail.


**Chapter Four**

This kid was hinky, all right. Button man, dope peddler, or can-opener, he was up to no good. Furthermore, he was acting like he was trying to make a clean sneak, maybe to his dive, so I continued to tail him through garbage cans, pricker bushes, and other such booby traps. I even got all tangled up in someone’s laundry line once, but he still didn’t crab that I was on to him. All I have to do is tighten the screws, then I’m sure he’ll sing. I’m such a great sleuth! It was completely worth it to quit accounting.


**Chapter Five**

Clark was freaking out at this point. Was he being stalked? Was he going insane? He didn’t know. He decided to go to the grocery store along with his stepmother, both to protect her and to convince her to stop buying eggs. The entire time he was sweating and looking around, obviously enough that his stepmother asked him what was wrong. It was at that point that he saw that same strange man, hiding behind the orange display.

Clark screamed and ran for his life, dragging his stepmother with him. Oranges rolled like heads during the French Revolution as the stalker leapt over the display, tearing the Food Pyramid poster in half. The man pulled out a gun.


**Chapter Six**

“Hands up!” I commanded. “Ditch the hostage, or I pump lead!”

***POW!*** The kid went off the track and pasted me on the schnozzle, making 
me drop my roscoe. Blood spurted everywhere.

The psycho picked up my bean-shooter and aimed at me with intent to burn powder, but the bim squealed on the whole operation, telling him how she hired me as a gumshoe to rank him. The patsy stared at her with his yap hanging open.

*“You* did this to me? Why would you hire this *freak* to *stalk* me!?”

“It was for your own good, dear. I thought you might be doing illegal things with your riffraff friends.”

***“I don't have any friends!”***

“Oh? But you sit right next to that Jones boy in almost every class!”

“I sit next to him so I can *copy off his work!* How *else* would I be surviving
English and algebra? … um… Forget what I just said!”

Aha! So the crime this egg committed… was *plagiarism!* Case closed!

Satisfied with my good work, I took the opportunity to scram, leaving in my 
wake a puddle of blood and my squabbling clients.


**Epilogue**

That night, Clark cowered beneath his covers, with a baseball bat by his side. As much as he wanted to believe his stepmother, he knew that since she didn't trust him, he couldn't trust her. He watched each shadow pass by the window with trepidation, and tried to determine if each floor creak really *was* the house settling down. What if there was *another* stalker, one that *wasn't* his stepmother's doing? He couldn't afford to sleep a wink.

It's the end of the year, again, and I want to offer my journey with you. The goal is to inspire people and get feedback myself so that we can break free from this addictive substance called caffeine. 



To make my point clear, I would love to start with the year 2023. In that year, I didn't have one single drop of caffeine in my body. Consciously, I avoided drinking coffee and tea. I also avoided chocolate, and I always researched medication to avoid caffeine. After one year of no caffeine, I was confident that caffeine was a thing of the past in my life. 



**Oh, how wrong I was!** 



The year 2024 was a nightmare. I slipt--stupidly, I might add--and started drinking coffee again. I struggled hard that year, and although I had coffee and other caffeinated products for approximately one-third of the year, the month of December caught me fully addicted again. I remember that during the holidays, last year, I was drinking five or six cups daily. At the end of the year, when there was only one minute before midnight between the years, I made a vow: to not have coffee in 2025. 



Fast forward, and one year has passed since then. The outcome? This year, I had zero cups of coffee. I also had zero glasses of Pepsi-Cola or Coca-Cola, and zero cups of caffeinated tea. In this sense, I am back on track again. I don't crave the coffee mug, and unlike 2024, this time, I will not cave in. (The reason why I am so confident is because I know what I did wrong two years ago.) 

  
**Objections** 



Because of my sugar addiction, I had chocolate this year. Not often, but I did. It wasn't that I was craving caffeine, but I was craving sugar and had nothing around me to satisfy my craving except sweets containing cacao. 



**My goal for 2026.** 

  
Stay away from coffee, caffeinated beverages, and other caffeine products. In the meantime, I did manage to beat my sugar addiction, so I won't be reaching for chocolate either.

We batch brew with the Aiden quite often and do max capacity batch brews.  

Is it me or is it that every time I pour with a full carafe, coffee tends to run down the carafe and spill on the counter with varying degrees?  I've poured slow, fast, and just about everything in between and always seem to get some liquid on the counter or floor.  I know I can brew less and break it up between brews, but I would rather not do that.  

Are there other Aiden compatible carafes available?

UPDATE I told Mom and she got angry with me, not him","I posted in another community too and they said its not relevant and my whole profile was suspended. But I wanted so much to share the update with you. So I hope its fine I post again

I (18M) for the past 2 years have seen a weird dynamic between my father (46) and my mother's younger sister (34).

My dad is a guy with some status. I mean not a big deal for the general population but he is the VP of company that has production and branches in 8 countries and is not exactly modest about it. No one is smart enough to give him advice, no one knows better. In his field I am sure he is very skilled. But no one knows better than him even with unrelated things like what furniture to buy, why the dog won't eat and stuff like that. When we eat, my mother puts the plate in his face, puts the food on that plate. And he looks around and is like: the recipe for this steak says it should be eaten without salt? And my mother instantly jumps up and brings the salt she forgot. I told him: you can bring it yourself if you need it. IDK how relevant it is, but my Dad is slavic, came here pretty poor when a student. My mother is from here (still european but more wstern)

He works long hours, meetings after meetings and then goes to jog or to the gym or during winter he goes to the pool to swim. During that that my mother (who also has a full time job tries to hurry with the dinner. I try to help her all the time but I really don't think she should be doing all that for him.

This aunt of mine is pretty funny and doesn't take life too seriously. 34, no kids and divorced with a history of affairs with married guys that ended in drama. Dad treats her differently than he treats everyone. He talks down to people and everyone is walking on thin ice around him. But my aunt doesn't. S was rubbing his arm: So, Mr. big boss, have you peeled potatoes yourself? Because they are the best and we all know only you can make ""the best"" things. And then she laughed. And he laughed too. He doesn't laugh with us. Dad's hobby is making wine. And he took my aunt to see the grapes and put a grape himself in her mouth. Or he was mowing the lawn and she said: oo Mr Engineer doing the ordinary man work. Where are your servants? He laughed.

People who work under him at the company or directly with him are under constant stress because he treats them like in military.  On bigger events, every time he is around people are somehow tensed. She put her hand around his neck and said: what u say, bro in law, would you make me your secretary? My mother didn't like that. and he laughed and said: you would beat my a..ss. She: and you would deserve that and winks. If my mother needs a ride he is always busy. Or if I needed (now I drive myself) but when my aunt called him at 10 pm to pick her up from the train station, he was at the office, but he went to pick her up.

And the update is: I told Mom without using the word cheat. Just about my concerns and she got angry and threw a a coffee mug on the floor. She got angry and cried and said to never repeat such nonsense. That its just in my head. She also immediately called Dad to tell him ""what I did"". I feel betrayed tbh. Why she needs to tell him everything? And I am a bit worried. He will be ANGRY with me when comes home. ",22,1767121321.0,WhatShouldIDo,21,0.89,False

Resubmit: 

Hello, I'm looking for general feedback on this partially finished short story I guess. I'm sorry it's not completed, but I've been sitting with it for too long and I feel like I have no creative juice right now to even edit. Maybe that's the universe telling me to just hold off, but I need a distraction at the moment. I was kind of hoping to get some insight on whether or not you think this story belongs in the magical realism realm or not. That's what I had in mind for this when I was writing, but I'm not sure that's happening here. Anyway, thanks for reading.

 \[1209\] It Takes an Army

Every morning it takes an army of little faeries to get me out of bed.

They rappel down the bedposts at dawn, forming ranks at my feet like I’m lying prone on a battlefield instead of a mattress. I keep my eyes shut while they assemble, but there is no point pretending I’m asleep.

The commanding officer is a redcap with a mouth like two maggots wriggling over a row of yellow teeth. He barks orders in a language that just sounds like a couple of bluebottles trapped in a jar and I wait patiently for him to finish. Waiting is one of the few things I am still good at.

When they move me, it is efficient. Precise. Hands under shoulders. Claw-tipped fingers at the ankles. No ceremony. They’ve done this before. Mornings are the worst.

Once I’m herded into a sitting position, I ask none of them in particular, “Where are we off to today?” The faeries ignore me. Too busy fighting off the dog for my robe again. A few sound like they’re arguing as they clean the empty cans and an unfinished bowl of ramen on the nightstand. I wait patiently for them to finish. Interrupting will do them no good.

“Forward,” the redcap commands, and they march me toward the bathroom with a sort of grim determination. A few peel off to manage operations: soap distribution, toothbrush control, shower calibration. They’re efficient, if not gentle, as they lather and scrub.

One loses his footing on the rim of the tub. I hear the quick plop, the tiny curse, the brief silence.

“Shouldn’t have stood there, brother,” I say, because talking helps.

Another gets too close to the drain, which to these guys probably looks more like a suckling vortex. Gone, like the snap of your fingers. Wings and all. Somewhere, I imagine, a faerie is wading through sewer water praying they won’t be reprimanded for desertion.

I’m dressed, scrubbed raw, my skin pink and cleaner than a nun’s breeches. The faeries line up on the counter, glimmering and smug as they look at their hard work and discipline in the fogged mirror.

\*\*\*\*\*

On the bus, the faeries have reorganized into two ranks: one guarding my head, the other managing posture. The redcap marches across my shoulder, issuing sharp instructions.

They tug at my cheeks until something like a smile settles in place. A passing woman with a tote bag gives me a scathing glare. The faeries beam. Mission accomplished.

In the waiting room, the air smells of burned coffee, leather, and too much disinfectant. The faeries keep busy picking lint and dog hair from my lap, pushing stray hair back behind my ear, tying and re-tying the laces on my shoes until they're the proper set of bunny ears.

“Don’t embarrass me,” I whisper hiss.

The redcap salutes with something that looks suspiciously like a middle finger.

When my name is finally called, the faeries snap to attention. Two anchoring my jawline for symmetry, one perched above my eyebrow. They make tiny adjustments as I walk in, pulling my lips upward, flexing my shoulders, rolling them back to rid me of the hump forming there.

“Good morning, miss!” The interviewer greets me a bit too toothy and bright this early, but the faeries do their best to copy him.

“Good morning.” It feels almost natural until a faery at the corner of my eyelid stumbles and loses grip. My right eye twitches like it wants to flee.

“How’s everything going today?”

“Fine,” I lie. The faery in charge of smiling yanks upward again. The corners of my mouth stumble under the strain.

The interviewer asks about passion projects. This is where some of the faeries really try to shine. Everybody wants to impress the commander. Prove they can lead too. One suggests helping animals. Another pushes for environmental or maybe coding—both are very hot right now. A third proposes firebombing the entire building. I tell the interviewer I like to read, which seems the safest compromise at the moment.

His chin dips. Jots something down.

A faery slides halfway into my collar and tugs at my head to maintain what I’m assuming means appropriate eye contact. Another uses my spine as a ladder, pinching in between each vertebra until my back snaps straight. They’re obsessed with good posture.

Then the interviewer says something faintly ridiculous, but it elicits a noise from my throat. Not a very pretty one. It’s loud and sudden, cracked, and embarrassingly honest.

The room goes silent. Even the faeries are unsure what the protocol is. It’s the first time I’ve caught them off guard.

The interviewer looks confused but smiles back anyway. Maybe he thinks I’m not the right fit for his team. Maybe he’s right.

The faeries yammer and drill singing cadence after we leave.

“You were terrible,” I tell them.

They sing on.

I cross the parking lot into the grocery store, shoelaces dragging on the dirty asphalt like leftover strings from a balloon.

Inside the grocery store, the fluorescent lights flicker and buzz. My cart squeaks ahead of me, one wheel wobbling rebelliously, and the faeries force me to abandon it for a smoother, less noisy one.  

The redcap perches on the cart's handle, pointing with a gnarled claw at the produce aisles. Each fire team he sends moves with a purpose. Only the essentials today.

One group scales the cereal boxes, wrestling with the brightly colored packaging. A faery with sickle-shaped wings tugs at a box of sugary peanut butter puffs, grunting as it topples into the cart. Another, more pragmatic faery hoists a bag of oats into the metal basket and glares at the other before tossing the puffs out. Clearly some of us weren’t paying attention during the commander's briefing.

In the dairy section, I can’t decide which creamer to get. They’ve got every kind of flavor you can imagine nowadays. The faeries lend a hand by propping up my wrist, steadying my grip, and aiming for the nearest sweet cream or else I'd probably just stand there all day, staring at the expiration dates until the store closed.

At the checkout, the cashier, a bored patron with neon nails, rings up my items with mechanical efficiency. The faeries form a perimeter around my wallet, one diving into the coin purse to fish out exact change.

""That'll be $43.47,"" she says, and when I hand her the quarter, two dimes, and several sleek copper pennies, our hands make contact for a second.

The change rattles and falls from palm to counter, and I immediately apologize, though clumsily, tripping over my words, but still managing to speak to them, slipping past the very bars of my teeth.

She laughs as she counts an extra penny somehow. She places it face up again on the floor. “My gammy says it’s only good luck this way.”

She then tells me she likes my (blank). I reply with something about her nails, but it isn’t very clever and I think I hear one of the faeries snicker. Thankfully, the cashier seems oblivious to their antics.",1,1767121208.0,u_BrassMermaid495,0,1.0,False

With simple ingredients and fuss-free steps, you can whip up this cozy tea recipe in minutes.","Not gonna lie, I usually fail pretty hard at making fancy drinks at home. My attempts to recreate coffee shop treats always end up tasting... off. But this week, I stumbled across a vanilla cinnamon milk tea recipe, and I figured, why not? At worst, it’d just be another kitchen flop to laugh about, right?  
  
So I gave it a shot. All it took was black tea, milk (I used almond milk because that’s what we had), a little vanilla extract, and a pinch of cinnamon. I added just a touch of honey to sweeten it. Let me tell you, the smell alone was magical—like a warm hug in a mug. And the taste? Even better. It’s got that perfect balance of coziness and sweetness with a little spicy kick from the cinnamon. Definitely feels like one of those cozy tea recipes you’d only expect at a fancy cafe.  
  
My kids surprised me—they loved it too! They’re picky eaters, so I expected them to complain about the cinnamon, but they said it tasted like a “grown-up hot chocolate.” My husband’s been sneaking cups of it in the morning, which is wild because I usually can’t get him to drink anything but coffee. For once, the whole family actually likes the same thing.  
  
Oh, and here’s a tip I figured out: steep the tea a little longer than you think you need to. It really makes the flavor pop when you add the milk and cinnamon.

To the parents of the boys riding small motor bikes in Winterville.

Today in front of the coffee shop in downtown Winterville, I watched a group of boys block the entire sidewalk while hanging out. When a man tried to walk through, he had to pass between them because there was no room to walk around. Instead of stepping aside or acknowledging him, one boy, who appeared to be the oldest, bucked at the man and flipped him off. Afterward, the group continued talking and laughing as if the man had somehow disrespected them simply by walking.

What made this worse was the presence of an adult who joined in and laughed at the man as well. Seeing that behavior encouraged rather than corrected was honestly disappointing.

Sidewalks are a public space. No one is more important than anyone else, and no one deserves to be mocked for existing or walking through town. Kids learn how to treat people by watching the adults around them. Please teach them awareness, basic respect, and how to share space with others.
Winterville should feel welcoming to everyone.

I supported her through a toxic work environment and natural disasters in her country. Just 1 day before New Year 2026, (As the time I post this here) I finally found out she had a boyfriend the entire time. When I confronted her, she tried to claim we were just friends and lied saying I never confessed my feelings to her but I did. I’ve stopped giving her the benefit of the doubt, blocked her on everything to protect my dignity, and I’m starting 2026 choosing my own happiness and determination.

​I met this girl on a letter-writing app. We talked for about 6 months on there and 2 months on social media. It started as simple banter, but eventually, it got extremely deep. I was raised not to burden people with my issues, but after I quit a toxic job, I opened up to her. She was supportive and sweet about it. When she faced her own toxic work situation, I stepped up for her with a 10,000-word letter of support for her all in one day just as a friend not a partner, but just a friend during that time.

​In her letters, she told me she was jealous of all her friends who were all in relationships while she was not and indirectly saying she want a partner and basically asking me indirectly do you have a girlfriend or not. I told her I do not have a girlfriend i never dated before due to needing to take care of my family first and working to support them financially at that time and than I indirectly say that I was open to a long-distance slow starting/casual relationship, and she responded by indirectly started sending hearts symbols and cat pictures to flirt/be sweet to me as a way to thank you and yes I am open to that and I want it as well. And during that time I felt I finally had a genuine friend and loving sweet partner that actually care about me and my wellbeing, and who I am as myself and as a person but later it turned out, it was not the case.

​When a hurricane hit her region, I panicked for her safety. I wrote a letter expressing my deepest feelings to make sure she knew she was love and careful. When she replied back atfer the hurricane, she said she was safe and her family as well than she became even more flirtatious and sweet to me. We eventually moved to social media and started texting daily despite a 12-hour time difference.

​I gave her headpats food pic I made for her and even coffee as well and I even get her cute nicknames that's was typical of couples and as well say loving and romantic things like I want to be the reason you smiled every day happily and truly feeling alive and content [Insert Name]. She responded back/get me hearts every time I do anything slightly sweet of affectionate or romantic.

​Around Thanksgiving, we had a misunderstanding about communication and expectation on more the relationship far. She told me, I’m doing laundry, I’ll reply/text to you everything later, please be patient with me. I waited 4 to 6 hours until I passed out on that day and when I woke up I found out we missed our chance to text live each not face to face but just simply texting each other live for just one day that hurt my heart the most during that time to be honest with you all. I was honest with her about it and suggested a system: just send a heart to each other to let each other know that we saw each other message but can't live text/talk and only just reply. She apologize to me and promised she would use it, but she never did. She started getting cold and ghosting me for days. Then, she would turn around and send me romantic songs about loving me, followed by ""dark"" songs that made me worry about her mental state.

​When I asked what was wrong, she told me It just a crazy month for my work and i'll tell you everything that happened over the past week so Please wait until the end of the month. Thank you for your patience. I reply back, I say okay, (I held to that promise.) and think her for taking that step to heal our relationship again because in the past she says she was itself conscious and have low self esteem about her appearance because in her culture she just looked regular, but in her culture beauty standard She is considered a extremely ugly person (Her culture beauty standard words not mine.) but to me she was the most beautiful person I have met not due to her beauty but simply who I thought she was as a person but later that was proven wrong.

​On Christmas, I sent her a video present a surprise gift showing her favorite food drinks, and even some virtual kisses, in the video and telling her I loved her in my voice-recorded I give her as well. She just said to me Merry Christmas to you too in have a great day and then later sent a flirty picture of self all dressed up but covering her face to do the flirty/shy cute act for the people she like/love, in her culture but hours later, she posted about being at an event, and implying she was on a date and in love.

​When I commented to support her because I thought it was a christmas gift for me because the previous picture was taking in the same area/event. she deleted it immediately. When that what happend a few more times I decided to finally went silent  because I thought it was a technical glitch the first time but as it keep happening doubt started to creep up in my mind. for one day of from me to her, she sent a song right after that basically accusing me of playing games. I finally put my foot down told her: No games. Just love and support for our relationship. Are we talking again, or are you just shy/nervous around me now or is there something wrong going on? She responded by saying I wasn't being sweet anymore in her cryptic way and in her language without being directed saying it to me and than I when silent again and she than finally text back and talk to me straight but she first say how my day was doing and how I have been and say what she up to, she say to me you can clearly see I was busy with my past weeks work, friends, life busy busy. Please don't use the word love or partner too much (not stop but not too much!?) In my culture, that is only for people in relationships or very close friends of the same gender. It’s sensitive I hope you understand.

​When I hear I stayed a gentleman about it and apologized if i made her feel uncomfortable for using that term and explained that all my texting and silence and support for our relationship and you was not in any way trying to make you feel uncomfortable or forcing on something that you did not want (insert name). I just thought we were in a relationship And I was trying to be a good, loving partner for us and you [Insert Name] and in my culture, honesty and directness and just tell how you truly feel when you are very close to someone you love and care for is the most highest forms of respect/sincerity and affection one can give when I thought we where in a relationship and than I finally ask her directly What is our relationship? Are we a couple or just friends? and what's been going on that have been bothering you for the past few months even if you say we are not in a relationship I am still your friend and I want to make sure you are okay and I will respect your decision to the fully of your wishes whatever that is in a reasonable way for the both of us [Insert Name] just tell me what's wrong.

​That is when she dropped the bomb: first of all I want to apologize for the misunderstanding on my part. And what I know is that we are just friend. And I never confessed to you, and you never confessed to me either (a lie, because I did). It made me uncomfortable knowing you misunderstood things while I have been seeing someone I sorry.

​She had a boyfriend and stayed silent while I poured my heart out during this entire time and she just say sorry instead of the mature thing of just letting me know earlier at the very least or shut it down entirely before all this happened in the first place. I told her: I understand Thank you for your honesty. I hope you have a great day with your work, family, friends, and the person you are seeing. I block/cut off contact with her and log out my accounts, but she tried to chase after me onto another platform that same day to get my attention. I blocked her there immediately too She wanted my emotional support and loving loyalty while she had a boyfriend in her home country why I was giving her the benefit of the doubt and worry sick about her during that time when it was ambiguous and quiet it on her end.

(​Again this is not the 100% full story; the actual events were more raw and heartbreaking than what I’ve presented here. I am keeping things anonymous to protect everyone that was involve including me, so please do not harass anyone this is not a putting on blast or a public call out it's just my way of getting the poison out of my system and celebration the new year for myself.

You are beautiful and worthy it. Workout, eat healthy, stay educated, and stay content and mostly consistent. I am proud to look in the mirror and see myself as a real man of honest, sincere, and respectable. I’m not afraid to face the world head on anymore Happy New Year.

1pzqa0f,https://i.redd.it/jypg4jtq0eag1.jpeg,Bottle Lock without padlock,"Was tired of my drinks 'mysteriously' draining when I'm not around, so I designed this bottle lock (inspired by the coffee creamer lock posted earlier this week). Also good for baby proofing.

I started with a padlock version but didn't have a bunch of padlocks, so I printed a latching version with a simple key. Someone determined to get in can always defeat this lock with pliers / hammer, but at least this creates a basic barrier to entry.

I can stay up to 2-3 in the morning without issue and I feel more productive in the evening and at night. I used to work a job as a Kitchen Lead and was in charge of the night crew and closing operations. And during this time, I thrived! I cannot express how incredibly productive I was and how well organized my mind was. I would sleep in till about 8-9, have breakfast between 10-11, and get everything I needed get done before 3, and go into work at 5, bust ass till between 12-2, stay up till 3-4, and go to back to bed. If I was working the next day I'd stay up til dawn and then sleep till noon, and I was still insanely productive. I wish I had become a nurse or medical practitioner because people in that field have told me the schedule opportunities mesh well with night owls.

I'm a truck driver. I have to be up by 4, at work by 6 or earlier, and I have to work till 5. I hate this life. I have to drag myself out of bed every morning and barely have the energy to get dressed, make coffee, and pack my lunch. When I get off everything is closed or closing. It's impossible to do any banking or white collar responsibilities. I haven't had brunch or breakfast at a cafe in years. I want to burn my CDL and go back flipping burgers just because of the schedule. My home life is non-existent and it's impossible to get anything done anymore.

**Why This Pick?** 

The last five straight meetings between these two squads have all finished under this number. Frankly, 234.0 feels wildly inflated, especially given recent form. The 76ers haven’t exactly been lighting up the scoreboard — each of their last three games finished below 234 points. As for Memphis, they managed just 112 points against the Washington Wizards a couple days ago, and three of their last four games failed to reach the 230s. My money’s on the Under to cash here, friends.

1pzq88w,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticSurgery/comments/1pzq88w/post_op_a_rapid_fire_list_of_things_to_expect_in/,Post Op: A Rapid Fire List of Things To Expect In The Days Following Your Brachioplasty / Extended Brachioplasty (Arm Lift),"Prelude: I had a breast lift and breast augmentation along with my arm lift. If you are strictly doing arm lift, there are chances you can do some of these things much quicker than I could!

Pain: This was the #1 thing I was “scared” of, even though I am a heavily tattooed tough woman that rides a Harley Davidson Road Glide. If you saw me standing there in my 6’ frame, you would laugh at the thought of me fearing pain, but I totally did. I admit I watched too many TikToks gathering opinions, and it was 50/50 across the board. I did have a combination procedure (breast), but this is strictly in regards to arms as this is an arm lift group. When I woke up, I felt a medium level stinging / burning sensation. It felt like when you get a fresh tattoo done, and the artist keeps wiping it down with to clean it. If you don’t have tattoos, I would compare this feeling like accidentally scratching a sunburn. It is completely tolerable, and you are barely aware of it while still having anesthesia in your system. I woke at 12 pm, and needed a pain pill at 3:30 pm. As the pain pill wears off, the stinging gradually comes back. Again, I promise, its not an end of the world searing pain like I was expecting. It is totally and completely manageable. However! For those who say they experienced a good deal of pain, I beg to question what medicines their surgeon had prescribed to them. I was completely covered. Gabapentin, Celebrex, Hydrocodone, and Valium. Day 12 post op now, and I am still on Gabapentin and thankful. I can feel small tingles and zaps, but I imagine those would be much stronger without the medication. My surgeon told me this when I expressed my concern for the pain: “ I’m willing to bet the pain you went through to lose the weight and get to this point was much more significant than what you are about to experience”. Well said, and very true for me. This was my first time being under anesthesia for a long period followed by heavy controlled substance pain meds, I truly didn’t know what to expect. I would take a pain pill, eat, take a nap, repeat. The first 3 days were a blur. My husband has pictures of me that I don’t remember. Lol.

IV: Looking in to IV placement, some women said they had it in their foot and it freaked me out.. As previously mentioned, I am a tattooed woman and do not have tattoos on my feet for a reason! Then, being the type A person that I am, I saw in specific situations IVs are placed in the neck and I started to spiral Again, the wonderful team I had, the IV went in to the top of my hand, and once I was under anesthesia they put an IV in my foot so they can better move the arms around during the procedure. I don’t care what the heck you put in my foot as long as I am knocked out! My nurse was nice enough to tell me this minutes before we went back. The sting in my hand was so minute because honestly, your adrenaline is rushing. Tiny pinch, barely feel it, you’re prepared for the worst.

Walking in to the surgery room: Another scenario I would think about and scare myself, expecting to see torture devices laid out everywhere!! My anesthesiologist told me in the holding room that he was hooking up a bag to my IV. He said that once we got about mid way to the surgery room it will feel like I had 2 too many martinis (lol). Once we left the holding room and begun our walk, he knew to the STEP when to say “ You are going to feel drunk right about now” . My response to him? “Woah”. LOL.

I walked into a room with a metal table, and arm extensions on either side. I barely remember sitting down on the table, and spinning around to lay back and lay my arms out. The anesthesiologist then said “ A lot of people say this gas is kind of stinky, tell me what you think”, laid a triangle rubber face mask on me. I barely remember seeing the dots on the foam board ceiling, taking 2 breaths of that, nodding my head that indeed was stinky, like rubbing alcohol, and it was lights out for me. I then peacefully awoke in a recovery room, curtain drawn around my bed, with a nurse at my side quietly typing on her laptop. I was very comfortable with pillows around me, and under my legs, with a hose that was blowing heat under my blankets. When I woke up, she offered me a sprite and ritz crackers. I wish I knew that angels name, she was so sweet.

Ride home: bumps in the road are irritating but not the end of the world. Please bring pillows to prop up your arms and a travel neck pillow. My travel time was 1 hour and 45 minutes with my husband driving as cautious as he could on Texas interstates. Also have your water with a long extended straw, and some cough drops incase your throat is sore from the tube.

First Meal (s): Something easy to eat and digest. I had high protein yogurt and boiled eggs.

Recovery Station: Have a recovery station setup for the first 3-4 days until you get a little more mobile. Water, medicines, snacks, pillows, blanket. Your house may look a little messy and cluttered, but you wont really mind while on the pain medication.

First Shower: First shower is odd. When you take the compression / wraps off the first time it just feels so strange. Sit down if you must, take your time. I highly advocate for a shower bench if within your budget. Standing with the fresh incisions and under pain medication was a little unsettling for me. This process has brought my husband and I even closer, truly. Make sure you are completely dry before putting on clothing. I had him blow dry me on low heat setting to make sure. Once the shower was done, and I was back in my chair, I felt like a new woman. I didn’t have him wash my hair until Day 4, It can wait. Let it be greasy. If you are able to and want to, kudos to you.

Clothing: Zip night gowns the first couple of days, commando. No pulling pants up, no fiddling with buttons. Day 4 I wanted to feel normal again so I graduated to button up PJs. Not so sure I will wear my zip night gowns again regularly, but will keep them for a future tummy tuck in a couple of years.  Have 2 pairs of pants / jeans one size larger than you normally wear, and the same for tops and jackets. You can read more about this further on in the post.

Cats: I did 2 additional litterbox with fresh litter in all the day before. Of course I had my husband to scoop it for me, but I have a tendency to be a bit neurotic (if you cant tell). I also stocked up on litter so neither of us have to carry it in from grocery shopping for a while. I was able to scoop on Day 5 no problem.

Leg & Ab Strength: I highly suggest 2 months prior to surgery you invest a little effort in to building up your leg and ab strength. My legs are fairly strong from walking, squatting, and being a generally active person during the day, but I wish I did some ab routines. You will be using these muscles to support your everyday movements in the days following surgery. I have done many deep squats during the day to pick things up rather than reaching or using a grabber. Think wide stance sumo squats. Sitting up out of the bed has been a task every morning, especially having a breast procedure done. Who knew you use your chest and arm pit muscles to sit up out of bed?? I do now! I joke with my husband that I am about to have a solid peach behind me from all this squatting.

Driving: I drove for the first time Post Op day 9. I wanted to try on day 6 but husband insisted I wait just a few more days. All you need to do is bring your chair close to the wheel, and feed your hands around the wheel with T Rex arms to turn. This has been a little weird for me to adjust to, because I typically drive one handed. I did go through a drive through for my first very glorious iced coffee. I pulled up as close as I could to the window to minimize my reaching.

Height: Inspired by my previous paragraph and reaching. If you are 5’ 7” and taller you will have a considerably easier time simply due to the fact that we have longer limbs to reach things without fully extending, so take that as a win!

When do you feel like yourself again?: I stopped all heavy pain medication, and graduated to Tylenol Extra Strength on Day 4. Day 5 I was a little out of it but in good spirits. I had my first post op appointment this day and got to straighten my hair and put a little makeup on. Day 6 I woke up just like myself, ready to take the world by storm just limited in my upper body movements. If you are woman that gets ready every day and enjoy doing so, as soon as you are able, start doing a little bit of your routine again. Every morning I wash my face, do my skin care, put on some mascara, and do my hair a little bit. It really helps the psyche! Every since Day 6 I have worn a pair of jeans, a belt, and some sort of top to feel human every day and its really helping to keep my spirits up. I personally cant be holed up in the house for days on end and enjoy it. Type A through and through, I’ve got to feel productive and “ touch some grass” like the younger generation calls it. Lol #millenial

Compression Type: I am in a garment that is sleeves and a bra in one, like a bolero, that has hook closures in the front. In addition to this, I am to have a long strip of lipo foam in each sleeve. I have no idea how I would get in to this if I lived alone. I have figured out how to take it off (cant tell me nothin) but getting it on is an entirely different story. This is definitely something to discuss with your surgeon if you live alone and what other options are available to you, especially if your surgery is an extended brachioplasty like mine that goes from elbow, through my armpit, and down the sides of my best wall to my bra line. Perhaps a Zip Sports Bra and singular compression sleeves on each side? Or Ace Bandages padded with ABD gauze until you get more mobility?

Supplements: I heard about Juven, read all of its rave reviews, and became a believer then. I started 1 packet a day of Juven one week prior to surgery. Following surgery, I have 2 packets of Juven a day. It doesn’t taste the best, but I add Fruit Punch water flavor drops to it, and half a packet of fruit punch electrolytes. Shaken up with Ice and its quite tastey in my opinion. Also, this is completely of your discernment, but there are other alternate peptide therapies out there that promote healing. I wont get too in to detail on that, but I am supplementing them and I believe I am on the fast track to healing compared to some of the other stories I have read about. That is a whole other rabbit hole in itself but may be of benefit to you to begin researching. 😊

House Chores: I could do *most* things myself by Day 7, very carefully of course. Exercise common sense here and don’t over extend yourself. I am a very healthy and fit 35 year old woman, 6’ tall with long limbs. I can reach and maneuver just about anything with adjusted body movements. I even figured out a way to mop my floors, with just hinging at my elbows. Others may chastise me but hey, Ive got to feel normal and move around or I will go bonkers.

Work: Thankfully, I had the ability to take off 18 full days from work. I have a desk job where I sit 95% of the day. I could have gone back post op day 10, without a day in my mind. If you are planning, a full week off, with both weekends, would be just fine. I am grateful that I had the 2^(nd) week just to make certain my incisions are closed, and I am at home in a peaceful environment. I am a female project manager in heavy civil construction, sh\*t gets tense and I don’t want that affecting my mental attitude while healing. If I worked from home I could have done back soon as post op Day 5.

Antibiotics ( for the ladys ): If you are prone to yeast infections due to antibiotics, during your preop ask them to prescribe you something for that. I am not prone to them, and still asked, because there is no way in hell I would deal with that in addition to what I had going on!

Periods: My period ended exactly 1 week prior to my procedure. When I woke from anesthesia, I had a cramp in my lower stomach. I told my sweet angel of a nurse. When we went to the bathroom, sure enough I was spotting. Thank goodness they had pads on hand in the bathroom. I have a history of starting my period at random times when under extreme stress (sounds kinda sissy of me to say, but its true). This spotting lasted 8-10 hours then went away. I’m sure my cycle will be a little wonky this month but ANYWAY, have pads or period underwear ready just in case. My husband is squeamish about that stuff, and again thank goodness my surgery center had pads ready.

Body Swelling & Sodium: When they say eat low sodium post surgery, boy do they mean it. I have a tendency to want comfort foods when down and out. I had chips, chocolate… it didn’t help this was just 5 days before Christmas being surrounded by all the Americanized sugary treats. In 4 days I went up EIGHTEEN POUNDS from water retention, and it was all in my torso and thighs. Surgery morning I weighed in at 181, Day 4 I weighed 199.8.  I’ll admit I was pretty defeated in those days following. I wish I’d worn some sort of stomach binder and took the low sodium thing more seriously. I am 12 days post op now, and 7 lbs up from surgery day. I can squeeze back in my original jeans again, barely. Eat. Low. Sodium!! Thankfully I had 1 pair of jeans a size larger than I normally wear that BARELY buttoned, and still had a muffin top. This can be disheartening to someone who just experienced major weight loss, losing a total of 180 lbs. Give yourself grace, cut way back on the sweets, salt, and late night snacking, and it will come off. Day 8 I was able to get in to an old waist slimming suit garment, and I have worn it every day. My stomach skin is puffy, and there is an indention where my pants sit, so I know its definitely water.

Forearm swelling: Previously mentioned, my forearms were so swollen I looked like popeye. I feel like the garment with lipo foam was just a bit too tight. I looked up lymphatic drainage massage on youtube. I could be more consistent with this, but I have done it a couple times and it has helped. Also, for my own sanity, I take the lipo foams out at night. I find I wake up a LOT less swollen in the forearms. I choose to wear it during the day while at home. Yes, its more uncomfortable to move around with it during the day, but I figure most of the swelling flares up from the consistent movement during the day and healing takes place at night while you are sleeping. Do with that what you will.

Mindset: I am a firm believer that your mindset determines most of your outcome from start to finish. Believe that this will be easy, and it will. Believe that you are well prepared, and you will be. Believe that you are tough and can do all things, and you absolutely will. Not much can hold be back, and it hasn’t! The month prior, and especially the morning of on our commute to the surgery center, I spoke many affirmations of strength, courage, and healing on myself. Hype yourself up! You got this far in your journey, haven’t you? Why CANT you do this surgery?

Is this procedure worth it?: 1 million times yes, I wish I would have had the courage to do it much sooner. I have lost major weight twice, and was too scared to follow through for an amplitude of reasons. Money, scars, time off of work, you name it. In fact, there were 3 separate times during my 9 month wait that I wanted to cancel the surgery and forfeit my deposit. I am SO GLAD that I didn’t and I followed through. I am incredibly proud of myself and my results. I cry a little every time I see my bare arms and new body in the mirror. Out of all the typing I have done, I cannot express the feeling you get from getting this done. The immediate confidence boost, and the freedom to wear regular short sleeve tops out in public, unmatched. If you have lipedema arms post weight loss like I did, sister, I am telling you, do the surgery as quick as you possibly can (while being prepared of course). Not only do you have the upper body of your dreams, you’ve now just proven to yourself AGAIN what you are capable of. A little tear fell just now, such a softy. (I’ll never admit that face to face though, 6’ tall tough Harley Davidson rider, remember?)

 

If you have made it this far in my post, thank you, I appreciate your time. And I hope it is of help to you. I owe my inspiration for this post to this one linked below. Hers was so very helpful. I read it easy 4 times in the months leading up to reassure myself that if she could do it ALONE, I could do it with the help of my spouse. HAPPY HEALING!! 😊

If you’ve tolerated my writing style for this long, and are interested, I’ve included a list of items needed post op. Grab a drink, and a snack (low sodium, remember?) and carry on.

 

Post Op Items list: Extended Brachioplasty +Breast Lift & Breast Augmentation

List of items are mostly for recovery within the first 7 days for all procedures previously listed. This list has been a life saver for me, and for my husband. I went into this with the mindset of wanting to have everything I could possibly need on hand, even though we live in a world with Amazon Prime. I have not yet advanced on to scar care, so those items will not be listed. This is the list I was endlessly searching for during my 9 month wait until surgery day. Note: I did not have drains, so I do not have items specific to care for those.

\#1\] Arm Rest Pillow ( “Gamer Pillow”, “Reading Pillow”)

\#2\] ABD Surgical Pads (to keep armpits padded and dry in your garment)

\#3\] Ace Bandage Wraps

\#4\] Lift Chair (if you have the funds, and can catch it on Amazon Prime Day sale I highly recommend, especially if you have combination breast procedure like I did)

\#6\] Standard Pillows x6 (Yes, 6. I wish I splurged and purchased memory foam. Check Walmart for better pricing!)

\#6\] Long Sleeve Compression Garment

\#7\] Shower Chair

\#8\] Back Support Pillow

\#9\] Zip Night Gowns/  “house coats” (first 3-4 days these are crucial. No pulling up pants, no fiddling with buttons)

\#10\] Button Up Pajamas

\#11\] Slip on shoes or indoor/outdoor slippers

\#12\] Grabber ( 2 if you have the budget, One for Living Room/Kitchen, one for bedroom/bathroom. I was able to get mine for $10 on Walmart vs $18 on Amazon)

\#13\] Caddy for Medicines

\#14\] JUVEN

\#15\] Bromelain

\#16\] Arnica

\#17\] Detachable Shower Head

\#18\] Stomach Compression / Binder (to control swelling and back pain from hunching)

\#19\] Low Sodium high protein foods, and healthy foods with fiber: Boiled Eggs, Cottage Cheese, Low sugar protein shakes, Precooked animal protein unsalted, Sola Low Carb bagels. I wish I would have been more religious about this. Within the first 4 days I swole up 18lbs in water weight!!)

\#20\] Paper Plates, Paper Bowls, Plastic Cups, Plastic Silverware. (lower the burden of dishwashing)

\#21\] Shaker Cups for your twice daily Juven x 6. I have 4, Wish I had 2 more in the rotation.

\#22\] Water flavor enhancing drops to go with your Juven (Yeah yeah, not the healthiest, but really makes the Juven taste more enjoyable)

\#23\] Low Sugar Electrolytes ( I really loved the strawberry Banana by Liquid IV. Delicious!)

\#24\] Stool softener. I used a combination of Colace and Milk of Magnesia, and was able to BM on PO Day 2.

\#25\] Extended Wiper Tool. Was worth the $10 to wipe myself in the first couple of days

\#26\] Wet Wipes for body

\#26\] Single use face washing clothes that foam up under water (Dove Brand on Amazon)

\#27\] Extendable Silverware

\#28\] Tube style extended straws (Turns your large water cup in to a camel back style of drinking)

\#29\] Couch / End Table caddy to keep drink, headphones, misc items organized on table tops ( Type A personality)

\#30\] Neck Travel Pillow.

 

Not required to have on hand, but have it just in case:

\#1\] Neosporin, Bacitracin ETC

\#2\] Additional Lipo Foam (this is what my surgeon uses inbetween the compression sleeves)

\#3\]  Scrunchies, Shower Cap, Head bands, Dry Shampoo.

\#4\] Extended reach loofa

\#5\]  Wedge Pillow for bed (this is by preference. I tried one night and didn’t like it. I preferred standard pillows stacked on each other)

\#6\] A phone or iPad stand would have been nice to have.

\#7\] 10’ long phone charger.

\#8\] Extendable back scratcher

\#9\] 1 pair of Jeans & 1-2 tops once size larger than you normally wear ( I happened to have this due to weight loss.)

 

Things I thought I needed to spend money on, didn’t, and glad I didn’t:

\#1\] a fancy matching 2 piece set. You really don’t need this. I wanted to look “put together” the day of surgery (my type A personality) and I promise it Does. Not. Matter. You’re so zonked out of your mind after anesthesia that you don’t care, and I promise your RN doesn’t mind if your post surgery outfit is coordinated or not!! I wore loose fitting sweat pants and a zip up jacket 2 sizes bigger than normal and it worked out perfect.

\#2\] An abundance of slide on shoes, button up tops etc. Again, this is specific to the first 7 days of recovery while sitting at home. If you work from home via video calls this may be entirely different for you!  

\#3\] The Velcro closure post surgery tops

I’m separated from a husband of 18 years, so this is all very new territory for me. Every Tuesday before work, I stop at the same coffee shop. For the past few months, one of the baristas and I have been exchanging very intentional eye contact, casual compliments (glasses, vibes), and we eventually exchanged names. She’s very outwardly queer; I’m more fem-presenting but pretty comfortable flirting.

Today my heart was absolutely pounding, and I finally decided to go for it. I gave her my business card with my personal number and (awkwardly but jokingly) said something like, “I’m not creepy! But you should text me.”

Now I’m spiraling a bit and overthinking whether that was too forward or inappropriate, especially since she was working.
I live in a small rural town, I generally trust my gaydar, and it really felt mutual … but now that I actually did the thing, I’m freaking out. Did I cross a line, or is this just first-time courage hangover?

1pzq26i,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalSquare/comments/1pzq26i/i_asked_chatgpt_whats_the_cheapest_way_to/,"I asked ChatGPT ""what's the cheapest way to advertise my local business"" and it listed 10 methods - here's how they actually compare (with real costs)","I run LocalSquare with my wife so I'm obviously biased, but I was curious what ChatGPT would recommend for cheap local advertising. It gave the usual list: Google Business Profile, social media, local SEO, flyers, word of mouth, online reviews, Facebook groups, email marketing, and paid ads.

All solid advice. But I wanted to break down actual costs because ""cheap"" means different things to different people.

**Free options:**

* Google Business Profile - essential, everyone should have this
* Social media posting - free but time intensive, organic reach is down to 2-5%
* Local SEO - free but takes months of consistent work
* Word of mouth - free but slow to build
* Online reviews - free but depends on customers taking action
* Facebook/Nextdoor groups - free but self-promotion often gets you banned

**Paid options (monthly costs):**

* Facebook/Instagram ads: $5-20/day = $150-600/month
* Google Local Service Ads: $50-500/month
* Yelp advertising: $300-1000/month
* Nextdoor ads: $100-200/month
* Local newspaper: $100-500 per ad
* Direct mail: $200-1000 per campaign
* LocalSquare: $1-12/month

That last one is what we built because we felt like there was a gap between ""free but takes forever"" and ""paid but costs hundreds.""

**What is LocalSquare?**

It's a digital version of those community bulletin boards at coffee shops and grocery stores. Every ZIP code in America has a 10x10 grid where you can pin a visual ad. You claim squares for $1 each per month.

**What you get:**

* Visual ad on your town's community board
* Your own webpage that gets indexed by Google
* Shows up in AI search results (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok)
* Google Business integration so your ratings show
* Can post to multiple ZIP codes if you're a service provider
* 10% goes to local charity
* No contracts, cancel anytime

**Why we built it:**

Most cheap advertising is either free but time intensive (social media, SEO) or paid but expensive (Facebook ads, Yelp). We wanted something in between. A 4-square pin costs $4/month. That's less than a coffee. And unlike Facebook ads that disappear when you stop paying, each pin creates a permanent webpage that keeps working for you.

**Best strategy we recommend:**

Combine the free stuff with one cheap paid option:

* Google Business Profile (free) - for search visibility
* Social media profiles (free) - for engagement
* LocalSquare ($1-12/month) - for community board presence
* Ask customers for reviews (free) - for social proof

Total cost: under $20/month for a complete local marketing presence.

**Who uses LocalSquare:**

Restaurants, real estate agents, contractors, plumbers, salons, gyms, coffee shops, local retailers. Basically anyone serving a specific geographic area who wants hyper-local visibility without spending hundreds on ads.

We're still growing and adding features, so happy to answer any questions. Also genuinely curious what other budget strategies are working for people.

I do have a long history of chronic stress and burnout which led to all sorts of things - water retention, lipidema, chronic inflammation, slow steady weight gain and it being literally impossible to lose weight, even on a glp I don't lose a single pound. I suspect my hormons to be completely out of balance, and my metabolism to be super slow. I'm not eating much to begin with and the only thing that has helped has been a keto diet actually. 

I have done juice cleanses in the past but only for like 5 days max.

1pzpqcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1pzpqcz/how_decisions_are_actually_made_and_how_to_guide/,How Decisions Are Actually Made (And How to Guide Them),"# How to Influence People WITHOUT Them Realizing It: The Psychology That Actually WORKS

You ever notice how some people just get what they want? Not in a pushy, aggressive way, but like they're operating on a different wavelength. You walk away from conversations with them feeling good, but somehow you agreed to something you weren't planning on. That's not manipulation, that's understanding how human psychology actually works.

I've spent months going down rabbit holes, reading behavioral psychology research, dissecting books by influence experts like Robert Cialdini and Chris Voss, watching breakdowns of persuasion tactics, and honestly? Most of what actually works is shockingly simple. The catch is most people never learn this stuff because we assume influence is either manipulation (bad) or charisma (you're born with it). Neither is true.

Here's what I found that actually moves the needle.

**Step 1: Shut Up and Listen (No, Really)**

The fastest way to influence someone is to stop trying to influence them. Sounds backwards but hear me out. When you actually listen, not that fake nodding while waiting for your turn to speak, but genuinely listen, people feel heard. And when people feel heard, they trust you. And trust is the currency of influence.

This comes straight from hostage negotiation tactics. Chris Voss, former FBI negotiator, breaks this down in ""Never Split the Difference"". The book won a bunch of awards and Voss literally used these techniques to save lives. His big thing? Tactical empathy. You reflect back what someone is saying, you label their emotions (""It sounds like you're frustrated with...""), and suddenly they're putty in your hands. Not because you tricked them, but because you made them feel understood.

Pro move: Use the ""mirror"" technique. Repeat the last few words someone says back to them as a question. They'll automatically elaborate and feel like you're on their side. Works insanely well in negotiations.

**Step 2: Prime Their Brain Before You Ask**

Your brain is lazy. It takes mental shortcuts constantly. You can use this. It's called priming, and marketers have been weaponizing it for decades.

If you want someone to say yes to something, get them saying yes to smaller things first. Ask easy questions they'll agree with. ""Beautiful weather today, right?"" ""This meeting could've been an email, huh?"" Stupid stuff. But their brain gets into ""yes"" mode.

Robert Cialdini's ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" is the bible on this. Dude's a psychology professor at ASU and his research on compliance tactics is referenced everywhere. He breaks down six principles of influence, commitment and consistency being huge. Once someone agrees with you on small things, they feel psychologically compelled to stay consistent. This book will make you question every purchasing decision you've ever made. Insanely good read if you want to understand how influence actually works at a neural level.

**Step 3: Make Them Think It Was Their Idea**

People hate being told what to do. But they love their own ideas. So instead of pushing your agenda, ask questions that lead them to your conclusion.

Instead of ""You should do X,"" try ""What do you think would happen if we tried X?"" or ""I'm curious, have you considered X?"" You're planting seeds, not dictating. They connect the dots themselves and suddenly they're way more invested because it feels like their decision.

This is Socratic method stuff, been around since ancient Greece, but it works because of something called ""self persuasion."" When people argue themselves into something, the belief sticks way harder than if you convinced them.

**Step 4: Use Reciprocity Like a Weapon**

Humans are hardwired to return favors. It's evolutionary. Someone does something for you, you feel indebted. You can trigger this.

Do small favors without asking for anything back. Buy someone coffee. Send them an article they'd find useful. Help with something minor. You're not keeping score (outwardly), but their brain is. When you eventually need something, they're way more likely to help because the reciprocity meter is tilted.

Cialdini covers this extensively. One study he cites showed that when waiters brought mints with the check, tips went up 3%. When they brought mints, walked away, then came back with MORE mints ""just for you,"" tips jumped 20%. Same mints. Different framing. Reciprocity is that powerful.

**Step 5: Scarcity Makes People Stupid**

Nothing makes people want something more than thinking they can't have it. Limited time. Limited quantity. Exclusive access. This isn't sleazy sales tactics, it's how your brain evaluates value.

When something is scarce, your brain shortcuts and assumes it's valuable. You can use this ethically. Frame your time as valuable. Don't always be available. When you offer to help someone, make it clear you've got limited bandwidth. They'll value your input more.

There's legit neuroscience backing this. Studies show scarcity activates the same brain regions as addiction. Your prefrontal cortex (rational decision making) gets overridden by your limbic system (emotional, impulsive). Knowing this lets you position offers in ways that trigger urgency without being manipulative.

**Step 6: Body Language Isn't BS**

Your nonverbals communicate more than your words. Match someone's energy level. If they're calm and slow-talking, don't come in loud and hyper. If they're animated, match that vibe. It's called mirroring and it builds subconscious rapport.

Also, maintain eye contact but don't be a psycho about it. The sweet spot is around 60-70% of the conversation. Too little makes you seem untrustworthy. Too much makes you seem intense.

Amy Cuddy's research on power poses got some flak but the core idea holds up: your body language affects how others perceive you AND how you perceive yourself. Stand like you're confident, and people treat you like you're confident. Fake it till you make it actually works neurologically because your brain takes cues from your posture.

**Side note on learning resources:**

If you're serious about understanding these patterns deeper, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from behavioral psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here. It builds personalized learning plans based on your specific goals, whether that's improving influence skills or communication. You can adjust the depth from quick summaries to detailed deep dives with examples, and it has this virtual coach feature that lets you ask questions mid-session. Pretty useful for internalizing these concepts without having to dig through dozens of books yourself.

**Step 7: Use Social Proof Like Gravity**

Humans are sheep. We look to others to figure out how to behave. You can leverage this.

Instead of saying ""I think we should do X,"" say ""Most teams are moving toward X"" or ""The industry standard is becoming X."" Suddenly you're not the one pushing it, the crowd is. And people don't want to be left behind.

This is why testimonials work. Why influencer marketing is a multi-billion dollar industry. Why ""9 out of 10 dentists recommend"" is a thing. We trust the herd more than we trust individuals. If you can position your idea as what ""everyone else"" is already doing, resistance drops dramatically.

**Step 8: Timing Is Everything**

Catch someone right after they've experienced a win. Their brain is flooded with dopamine, they're in a good mood, they're more open to new ideas. Ask for favors after good news. Pitch ideas after successful meetings.

Studies on ""decision fatigue"" show that people make worse decisions as the day goes on because their mental energy depletes. Judges are more likely to grant parole in the morning than afternoon. Same logic applies to influence. Ask for big things when people are fresh, not burnt out.

**Step 9: The Ben Franklin Effect**

This one's counterintuitive as hell. If you want someone to like you more, ask them for a small favor. Not a big one. Something minor.

Why does this work? Cognitive dissonance. When someone does you a favor, their brain rationalizes ""I must like this person because I wouldn't help someone I don't like."" They convince themselves they like you to justify their behavior.

Ben Franklin used this to win over a rival by asking to borrow a rare book. The rival lent it, and afterwards became Franklin's ally. Your brain is weird like that.

**Step 10: Stop Trying So Hard**

The biggest influence killer? Desperation. When you need something too badly, people sense it and pull back. Influence works best when you're outcome independent. You're okay whether they say yes or no.

This isn't playing games, it's genuine detachment. When you don't need their approval, they're more drawn to you. Scarcity of attention works on a personal level too. Be willing to walk away and suddenly people want you at the table.

Influence isn't about controlling people. It's about understanding how decisions actually get made, how trust gets built, and how to position yourself and your ideas in ways that align with how brains work. Most people are flying blind. Now you're not.",1,1767119381.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

1pzpovi,https://i.redd.it/22mz7rjwwdag1.jpeg,What happened this year?,"1. My sister died at the age of 44. May she rest in peace. Take care of your health, don't smoke or drink excessively.

2. I had appendicitis in Dubai, it was tough.  Repeating the point from item 1 - take care of your health!

3. I closed my office in Russia and focused on global markets.  At the same time, I received the ""Investor of the Year"" award from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the ""Exit of the Year"" award at the Startup Summit from Sberbank and the Moscow Government.

4. In 2019, I invested 7 million rubles in the robotics company TECHNORED, and in 2025, the public company ASTRA invested and signed a development program worth 6.7 billion rubles (the deal was covered by Forbes, Kommersant, and others).

5. I fired 90% of the management company staff, including our CEO, and returned to management myself.

6. I faced a hostile takeover of one of our assets and blatant betrayal by people I trusted. They cut us off from a dividend stream of approximately $1 million per year and dragged us into costly litigation. This is now my personal war, and I will definitely see it through to victory, after which I will publish everything in detail, including names.

7. We are closing the year with a loss of approximately $1.3 million - this is unpleasant, but not fatal. Thanks to unrealized profits from asset growth, we are not in the red, and next year we simply won't have such expenses that will drag us down against the backdrop of zero investment activity in Russia, and I predict a profit of $4-5 million.

8. The stock market, meanwhile, showed a small positive return of 15-16%, nothing to be particularly proud of this year.  However, we earned 29% annual returns for some clients - more than for ourselves. We are currently collecting feedback from them. 

9. I moved to the US, raised equity investments here, and assembled a small team. Our revenue this year is small – about $150,000 – but our stake in the scooter business is already being offered for +$700,000 compared to what we invested in 2024.  And there's more to come: paints 🎨, sourdough starters 🥛, coffee ☕️, dating 🦋.

10. Given that we have 190 shareholders in Russia, and about 150 of them want to go global with me, I'm solving a complex legal problem – migration and asset exchange in Russia, taking into account tax implications and everything else. We're doing everything legally and fairly.

In conclusion. A lot of bad things happened this year, and despite being an optimist, based on the information I'm receiving from various sources, things are likely to get even worse next year. I have thoughts and a plan on what to do about all this. I sincerely believe that everyone bears some responsibility for what is happening in Russia now. As long as people treat what's happening as a natural disaster and think they have no influence, nothing will change. Until they learn to unite and take collective action, improvements will not come. And what kind of actions these might be, we'll discuss next year! 🎅 Happy holidays everyone! I'm not giving up, and neither should you!",1,1767119287.0,goatinvest,0,1.0,False
1pzpoj2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzpoj2,Magic Alley by LKWood,"https://www.flickr.com/gp/63237092@N08/1W7MFf98h4

Lots of pics at link

Diagon Alley, my 3rd LKWood build. I’ve got one more in backlog and 3 on order.  This is probably one of the most iconic and common Harry Potter book nook scenes as it lends itself to the book nook medium very well.  

LKWood takes a more muggle approach to the architecture and style forgoing all the warped dimensions and the like in preference for a more real style.  This one does something very different as well by actually having all the shops and such having backlit windows which does something very different much to add life to the scene.  

It also features a cobblestone floor that you have to assemble one stone at a time. 

Be forewarned, it doesn’t ship with any additions, it’s pure architecture lights and windows so any customization you do you will have to supply the detris elements yourself. However they do include several variations of different signage.

Paint quality on this is not bad. It suffers from a little bit of being washed out which looks mostly due to the underlying material.  It’s actual wood and not mdf.  This also can cause issues as there are some extremely thin areas so if the wood has a defect, you have to compensate or repair it yourself.  Had to do that with some windows.

Instructions on this is not great. There were several places where they skipped steps such as:

\* adding the small second floor window on olivander’s (has a window and frame piece)

\* the support bracing for the floor

\* windows added to the 3rd floor left side

\* a window guide. (There is windows for every place even if not in the instructions)

\* a couple of other places get a little glossed over but don’t leave you scratching your head.

On the topic of windows.  There is not a guide and honestly I should have taken a picture and notes because it absolutely needs one.  All the windows fit snug in their spots so if they feel too small, you have the wrong window. The windows for the doors are too tall by about a centimeter so place and trim those.

The sconces on the walls come pre bent but in my opinion the bend is too far down.

The instructions show you assembling the layers of Gringots one columned section at a time then adding them. Don’t do that, instead start from the bottom and slip the column bamboo in after the bottom floor of each level has a base under it. Build from the bottom up.  The paint job on gringots is “dirty” and practically impossible to match too.

The bay window braces are only printed on one side and they kind of mixed up the count for the sides. You will have to take 2 of the opposite side braces and paint those for the 3rd floor Olivanders shop. 

There is a lot of wood colors and edges here. I found the a base layer of red alcohol based paint overlayed with a dark brown alcohol based paint made the best match for a bunch of the wood. For the most part the alcohol and water based paints were more appropriate to the rest of the paint job.

For the brick edges, a brick red base acrylic overlayed with various brown alcohol and water based paints worked best. Was almost a perfect match

The wiring for this requires an amateur electrician. lol joking aside you will need some wire strippers, electrical tape and a good deal of patience.

Now onto the mods:

\* edge and underside painting

\* copied Olivanders sign and the shield sign and had ai clean them up and enlarge them a little. Then printed it out on vellum, cut, maxed stickers out of them and put a base layer of off white acrylic on the sign and stuck the new sign in the place.  Used the vellum as it match the feel of the wood paint job where my test with standard paper felt off.

\* added leaves from Dreamy Mini Alley I had left over

\* added summer/autumn grass tufts in several places

\* took a scan of the wonderful set of Potter sheets from Magic Library (the round nook I posted a while ago) and resized to half size then printed a sheet of them off on a high dpi on both photo paper and vellum.  The photo paper came out super crisp.  Cut those up and turned them into stickers and placed the vellum ones in various windows and the photo paper ones on walls, the ground and turned a stack of them into a stack of the daily prophet wrapped in twine (black wire)

\* on the green and gold lettered square sign, I cut and carved the plaques off of one and added it to the other to create a depth for it.

\* repainted a bunch of the signs to be more varied and look better. They were all very flat drab colors

\* on the top of the walls they left openings into the interior that you could see the bare leds through so I cut some scrap window and covered those up.

\* I stained the underfloor of the cobblestone and the exterior walls and baseplate.  This is an absolute must for a lot of these LKWood pieces. It turns them into a finished product.  I used a coffee stain but choose the one you would like.  The wood really is beautiful with the stain on it.

\* replaced the batteries with the corded fake batteries as I never want to take the battery case out

And that’s it.

So like previous ones I’ve done of LKWoods, an absolutely stellar model that absolutely needs better instructions.

My high school was focused on studying scientific subjects (in Italy we have specific topic-related high schools), and I was good at everything, except history and philosophy.

1pzpdfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1pzpdfp/the_subtle_habits_that_make_people_instantly/,The Subtle Habits That Make People Instantly RESPECT You: Science-Based Psychology Cheat Codes,"okay so i spent way too much time studying this. like actually researching what makes certain people command respect without even trying. read dozens of books on psychology, watched interviews with charisma coaches, listened to podcasts about human behavior. and honestly? most advice out there is recycled garbage.

the truth is way more interesting. respect isn't about being the loudest person in the room or having the fanciest job title. it's abo ut these tiny behavioral patterns that signal competence, authenticity, and emotional intelligence. most people miss them entirely.

here's what actually works:

**stop explaining yourself constantly**

this one hit different when i first learned about it. robert greene talks about this in **""the 48 laws of power""** (yeah i know it sounds manipulative but hear me out). the book is basically a historical analysis of power dynamics, written by a guy who studied strategy under hollywood executives.

when you over explain your decisions, you subconsciously signal insecurity. ""sorry i can't make it tonight, my cat has a vet appointment and also i have this work thing and honestly i've been really tired lately and..."" vs ""i can't make it tonight, but let's reschedule soon.""

people who respect themselves don't feel the need to justify every choice. they just state their boundaries clearly and move on. it's not about being rude. it's about understanding that your time and decisions have inherent value.

**master the pause**

this comes from negotiation research and honestly it's kind of wild how effective it is. chris voss (former fbi hostage negotiator) breaks this down in ""never split the difference"". before he was teaching negotiation tactics, he was literally talking people off ledges and negotiating kidnapping releases.

when someone asks you something, especially something challenging, don't rush to fill the silence. pause. think. then respond. rushing signals anxiety. pausing signals confidence and thoughtfulness.

people unconsciously interpret that pause as ""this person's thoughts are valuable enough to require consideration."" sounds weird but it works. even in casual conversation, that extra second before responding makes people lean in more.

**fix your posture but make it subtle**

not like military rigid. just... taking up your space. amy cuddy's research on body language (yeah the ted talk person) found that how you hold yourself literally changes your hormone levels. expansive postures increase testosterone and decrease cortisol.

but here's the thing nobody talks about: it's not about power posing in front of people. it's about training your default resting position. shoulders back, chin level, feet planted. when this becomes automatic, people perceive you as more capable without knowing why.

there's this app called ""posture pal"" that randomly buzzes you throughout the day to check in. sounds annoying but after like two weeks it becomes automatic.

**listen like you're getting paid for it**

most people listen just enough to figure out when they can talk next. real respect comes from making others feel genuinely heard.

practical tip: when someone finishes speaking, pause for one full second before responding. then reference something specific they said. ""you mentioned feeling overwhelmed with the project timeline, what part is causing the most stress?""

the book ""just listen"" by mark goulston (psychiatrist who worked with fbi on hostage situations, similar to voss) explains this perfectly. he calls it ""listening with fascination"" rather than listening with judgment or advice queued up.

people will literally describe you as ""so intelligent"" and ""such good company"" when really you just... listened well. wild but true.

**disagree without being disagreeable**

this is from ""difficult conversations"" by the harvard negotiation project team. instead of ""no you're wrong about that"" try ""interesting, i see it a bit differently because...""

you can hold your ground without making someone feel stupid. that's rare. people respect the hell out of someone who can challenge their ideas while still making them feel respected. it signals intellectual confidence rather than ego protection.

**stop apologizing for existing**

""sorry, can i ask a quick question?"" no. just ""hey, quick question.""

""sorry for the long email"" becomes ""thanks for reading.""

""sorry i'm late"" (when you're 2 minutes late) becomes ""thanks for waiting.""

reframing apologies into gratitude shifts the entire dynamic. apologizing constantly trains people to see you as someone who's always in the wrong. thanking them positions you as equals.

there's this concept in psychology called ""self deprecation bias"" where people think constant apologies make them seem humble and likeable. research shows it actually does the opposite. makes people perceive you as less competent.

**follow through on tiny commitments**

this is probably the most underrated one. ""i'll send you that article"" and then actually sending it. ""let's grab coffee soon"" and then actually suggesting a time within a week.

people are drowning in flaky behavior. when you're the person who actually does what they say, even with small stuff, you become memorable. your word starts carrying weight.

the compound effect of this is insane. after six months of being reliable with little things, people start trusting you with bigger things. they recommend you. they want you around.

**own your mistakes quickly and specifically**

""my bad"" is lazy. ""i messed up the timeline on that report, here's how i'm fixing it"" shows accountability and competence simultaneously.

people don't lose respect when you make mistakes. they lose respect when you deflect, make excuses, or pretend it didn't happen. brené brown's research on vulnerability (she's a shame and empathy researcher at university of houston) found that people who own their failures are perceived as more trustworthy and capable.

**stop filling every silence with noise**

comfortable silence is a dominance display in the animal kingdom and honestly? still applies to humans. when you're okay with quiet moments in conversation, it signals security. anxious people fill every gap with chatter.

next time you're in a group setting, notice who's comfortable with silence and who's scrambling to fill it. the comfortable ones tend to command more respect.

**other resources that helped**

BeFreed is an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that creates personalized podcasts from books, research papers, and expert talks. What makes it useful is the adaptive learning plan, it actually builds a structured path based on your specific goals and struggles. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples depending on your mood.

The voice customization is legitimately addictive. There's a smoky, sarcastic option that makes even dry psychology concepts entertaining during commutes. Plus there's a virtual coach avatar you can chat with to ask questions or get book recommendations. Helps turn all these concepts into something you can actually internalize through flashcards and a personal mindspace feature. Worth checking out if you're serious about consistent growth.

real talk though, this isn't about manipulating people or playing mind games. it's about developing genuine self respect that naturally radiates outward. people can smell fake confidence from a mile away. but when you actually value yourself, set boundaries, and show up authentically? that's what creates lasting respect.

none of this happens overnight. took me months to internalize even half of these. but the shift is noticeable. people started asking my opinion more. including me in decisions. taking my time seriously.

What grinders would y’all recommend if I am looking to spend $750 max? 

I would also be happy with a less expensive grinder that has better adjustment steps. Not really sure what I need or how much of a difference a $700 grinder would make compared to a $350 grinder if I’m making lattes. Appreciate any advice!",1,1767118563.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Diane stepped out of the elevator into the grand, spacious lobby of her midtown office, its ceiling adorned with vibrant murals of iconic capital cities.

Nick stood by the security desk, chatting with a sixty-something guard, likely about his beloved Rangers.""

Diane tried to steady her nerves. She was undeniably drawn to Nick—an educated, successful, handsome, and charming man. Being asked out by someone like him felt flattering, almost surreal.

When Nick spotted her, he cut his hockey talk short.

""I don't know what you did upstairs, but you look incredible.""

Diane blushed. ""Just a touch of blush and lipstick. Didn't want to look like I worked all day.""

""Well, I added some extra hair gel and cologne myself,"" Nick said with a grin. ""Wasn't gonna mention it, but since you did...""

They both laughed, the ice melting between them.

""Do you like seafood?"" Nick asked. ""There's a spot in the Village with killer surf and turf.""

""I'd love that,"" Diane said. ""Where I'm from, dinner out means Italian or Chinese. Seafood's a nice change.""

""Change can be good,"" Nick said with a smile. ""Come on, I'm parked across the street.""

The lot attendant spotted Nick, grinned, and darted to fetch his car. Moments later, he pulled around the corner in a sleek BMW 325e—the quintessential yuppie car, screaming ambition and polish. It suited Nick perfectly: successful, refined, and self-assured.

The attendant hopped out, and Nick slipped him a bill with a practiced ease. Diane noted it, impressed. Danny pulled off similar moves, but where Danny was rough like sandpaper, Nick was smooth as fine Egyptian cotton.

Nick drove downtown, weaving effortlessly through the city's bustling streets. New York hummed  with after-work crowds and tourists diving into the sights and shops.

He parked on Bleecker Street, right by The Clipper Seafood Bar. Darkness had settled in, but the restaurant's glowing neon lights cast a warm, inviting vibe.

Nick hurried around to open Diane's door, offering his hand. As she stepped out, her eyes locked onto his, searching, almost piercing. The urge to pull each other into a kiss hung between them, unspoken. Instead, they walked into the restaurant and were led to a cozy corner table in the back. 

Fishing poles and nets lined the walls, giving the place the cozy, lived-in feel of an old fishing boat.

""So, here we are,"" Nick said, easing into the conversation with a hint of awkwardness.

""Here we are,"" Diane replied, feeling a surge of confidence as his gaze made her feel desired.

""I spend a lot of time in the city,"" Nick said. ""Grew up in Manhasset, Long Island. My family's got a place in the Hamptons, right on the beach. Maybe you'll check it out this summer.""

He wasn't bragging, just being himself—open, genuine, the only way he knew how.

""Makes me wish it was summer already,"" Diane said. ""Do you still live on Long Island?""

""Nah,"" Nick said. ""My family does. After graduating Villanova and starting at Desmond and Johnson, I got an apartment on 79th and York. Feels like I'm in the heart of everything.""

""I'd love to live in the city someday,"" Diane admitted. ""Brooklyn's great, especially the people, but it's something I'd like to move on from eventually.""

""That's how I felt about Long Island,"" Nick said. ""Loved growing up there, but I needed to break free."" He paused, then added, ""I can see going back someday, though—once I meet the right woman, settle down, start a family.""

Diane smiled. ""That shouldn't be hard for you. You're a catch—handsome, successful, charming. I could fall for you in a heartbeat. But I need to be honest, for both our sakes. I'm still with my boyfriend. I don't know how long that'll last, but for now...""

""For now, let's be friends—at least, I hope we can be,"" Nick said, his tone earnest. ""But I need to be honest, too, for both our sakes. You're incredible, Diane. Your marketing skills are top-notch, and your future's bright. I hope this isn't too forward, but you're the most beautiful woman I've ever met. I felt that way the moment I saw you. So, let's order a great meal, kick back, and keep getting to know each other. Friends.""

Diane smiled. ""The surf and turf sounds perfect.""
Nick waved over the waiter. ""We'll both have the surf and turf, and a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon.""

""You're not making this easy, are you?"" Diane teased, her eyes playful.

""Can't say,"" Nick replied with a grin. ""Guess we'll see what happens.""

After dinner, Nick asked for the check, slipping his corporate card into the leather folder. When the waiter returned it, Nick tipped generously in cash—a practiced ritual, Diane noted.

""Let me drive you home,"" Nick offered.

""That's sweet, but I don't want to put you out,"" Diane said. ""I'll take the train.""

""Come on,"" Nick said. ""You've seen how I drive. I'll have you home and be back at my place in no time.""

She relented with a smile and slid into his car. When he pulled up to her house, they sat in silence for a moment.

""Well, this is me,"" Diane said, breaking the quiet.

""See you at work tomorrow,"" Nick said. ""Thanks for an amazing evening getting to know you.""

Diane hesitated, then leaned in slightly. ""I think you should kiss me goodnight, Nick. Otherwise, we'll both be up all night thinking about it, and I need some sleep.""

""Agreed,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Wouldn't want to dock you for being late.""

He leaned over, and their kiss was long, passionate, but stopped short of crossing a line that would've sent them back to his place.

They agreed to keep work and personal lives separate—for now. But as Nick had said over dinner, they'd start as friends and see where it led.

Chapter 22- Happy Birthday Debbie 

I strolled into the office that morning, ready to settle in. I set my two hefty loose-leaf binders—packed with essential cheat sheets—on my desk, propped one foot up (just one, per the collective bargaining agreement), and sipped my fresh-brewed deli coffee.

Stan arrived earlier than usual, dropping his briefcase—mostly stuffed with lunch and music trade magazines—onto his desk. He waved me over urgently.

I got up, hoping it wasn't work-related since we still had twenty minutes before the clock started.

""Gerry,"" Stan whispered, like he was sharing a state secret, ""it's Debbie's birthday today. She told me yesterday, so I asked her to dinner, and she said yes!"" His eyes gleamed with excitement.

""Okay,"" I said, unimpressed.

""No, you don't get it,"" he said. ""We were drinking wine.""

""And?"" I asked, skeptical.

Stan stared at me like I'd grown three heads. ""The restaurant was dimly lit. Candlelight. We were looking into each other's eyes.""

""And?"" I said again, waiting for a punchline I knew wasn't coming.

His eyes narrowed, frustration creeping in, one eyebrow arched. ""A violinist was wandering the restaurant. He stopped at our table and played a romantic Italian song just for us.""

I paused, letting it sink in. ""So, you treated Debbie to a nice birthday dinner, she gave you a friendly peck on the cheek, and you both went home alone."" I patted his back. ""You're a good friend, Stan.""

I glanced back as I returned to my desk. He sat there, staring straight ahead, biting the inside of his cheek.

Just then, Debbie breezed in. ""Good morning, guys!"" she said cheerfully.

""Morning,"" I said. ""Happy birthday!""

""Aw, thanks, Gerry!"" she said, flashing a smile and giving me the same friendly peck on the cheek Stan had gotten post-dinner.

I settled back at my desk, leaving Stan to stew in his thoughts.

Vinnie called Steve and me to join him at the eighth-floor wire panels. As first-wave digital technicians, we were green compared to veterans like Vinnie, who'd spent years mastering analog systems.

He studied a piece of engineering paper in his hand. The circuit he was troubleshooting was down hard—a critical line feeding the New York Stock Exchange's ticker, keeping brokers updated on trading quotes.

Vinnie suspected a broken wire right at the panel. Normally, we'd open a ticket for N-Tech to handle, but he saw a chance to teach Steve and me how these circuits were wired.

""Alright,"" Vinnie said, taking charge. ""We're getting on the floor under the panel. Steve, you're in the middle. Gerry, take the far end. I'll tug this wire. Steve, when you see it move, pull back so we know it's good up to there.""

Steve spotted a wire shifting and pulled it taut. ""Got it,"" he said.

""See?"" Vinnie said. ""We're good to that point. Gerry, you seeing any movement on your end?""

""Nothing, Vinnie,"" I said.

""Just as I thought,"" he said. ""Steve, now pull the wire toward Gerry's side.""

Steve complied as Vinnie traced the wiring between us. 

""There it is,"" Vinnie said, pointing. ""The wire's frayed right here."" He pulled a splicing tool from his pocket and deftly repaired it. I tugged from my side, and Steve confirmed he could see the movement.

""Good work, guys,"" Vinnie said. ""Think we got it.""

He called down to Sandy. ""Sand Man, check the circuit I left on my desk. Restored yet?""

""Clean and green, Vincent,"" Sandy replied. ""It's back up.""

""Nice job, gentlemen,"" Vinnie said. ""I'm sure the brokers are thrilled. I'll give them a call.""

We thanked Vinnie for the lesson. Learning something new was always a rush, and most of our seasoned mentors, like Vinnie, were eager to share their expertise—well, most of the time.

By the time we returned to our desks, it was almost break time. Vinnie had called the Stock Exchange to report the fix, then closed out his ticket. 

Turning to Steve and me, he grinned. ""You boys earned your keep today. Come join us in the alley.""

No way we'd turn down Vinnie's invite. The crew—Vinnie, Sandy, Dead, Steve, and I—headed to the alley, where Vinnie sparked up a joint.

It wasn't fat, but it didn't need to be. That was some quality weed. A couple of tokes each, and I was as mellow as a smooth jazz saxophonist.

Sandy, as usual when he's high, started giggling. I couldn't resist—grabbed him under the arms and tickled him. His giggles turned into full-on belly laughs, and soon we were all cracking up.

Back at our desks, we'd mostly pulled ourselves together. Not Sandy though. He was laughing so hard tears streamed down his face. 
""Freaking Gerry,"" he gasped between chuckles.

Vinnie smirked. ""I haven't seen him lose it like this since we saw Big Bamboo with Cheech and Chong.""

It wasn't until lunchtime that Sandy's laughter finally died down. He made me promise never to tickle him again. I swore I wouldn't, but I crossed my fingers behind my back—just in case.

I heard later that Ramy took Kenny and Pete up to N-Tech, just as Vinnie had done with Steve and me earlier. He'd pinpointed the issue to a faulty D4 channel card and offered to show them how to replace it.

During our afternoon break workout, I cornered Gary to get the scoop. He explained that he'd gotten the green light from the N-Tech manager to let us tag along and troubleshoot a few issues firsthand, so we could see what the job really entailed. Gary didn't just have our backs—he had all our sides covered.

When I got home that evening, I hopped straight into the shower. Mary called out that I didn't need to cook—she was craving stir-fried veggies and chicken in the wok her mom had given us as a housewarming gift.

She walked in just as I was toweling off. Without missing a beat, she started cooking, and soon the kitchen was filled with the mouthwatering aroma of sizzling vegetables and chicken.

We sat down to eat, and she set steaming plates in front of us. I took a bite and grinned.
""Hon, you've outdone yourself. This is absolutely delicious.""

""Thanks,"" she said with a smile. ""Just soy sauce and a little duck sauce magic.""

I leaned back, savoring the meal. ""So, Stan took Debbie out to dinner last night for her birthday. Not sure what's going on with that guy. Guess he wants to dance close to the flame without getting burned.""

Mary raised an eyebrow. ""Stan's married, right? That wouldn't fly with you. Does his wife know?""

""Nah,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Stan's just a frustrated crooner, stroking his ego now and then. Besides, Debbie's into girls.""

Mary gave a sarcastic chuckle. ""Oh, well, that makes it all fine then. But don't let me catch you out with Debbie—or any other girl, gay or straight. I'll stroke more than your ego—and you won't like it.""

""No worries, Tiger,"" I said, laughing. ""I checked my ego at the door the day I met you.""

Mary grinned, then her face lit up. ""Oh, I'm so happy Angie's back at work. She said she had a blast getting to know Jeff's folks. They're even planning to have us over to try some new kosher dishes Jeff's mom taught her.""

We kept the conversation flowing. I had her cracking up with the story of Sandy's uncontrollable giggles at work. After dinner, I cleared the table while she tackled the dishes.

We settled onto the couch, flipping on MTV for some music videos. I leaned in, kissing the back of her neck. 

""You know you're my one and only.""

She turned to me, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""And you're mine. But I'm not making any promises if a hot gay guy starts working with me.""

I laughed, pulling her closer. ""Deal. As long as I get to watch you fend him off with that fiery charm of yours.""

We sank deeper into the cushions, the music filling the room as we traded playful jabs, content in our little world.

Chapter 23- First Of Many

Andre was getting ready for his first date with Linda. He showered, blow-dried his hair, and spritzed on the new cologne a coworker had sworn by.

He slipped into the light blue button-down shirt he'd picked up on 86th Street, paired with crisp dress pants. Studying his reflection, he gave himself one last once-over. He looked as sharp as he could manage. A deep breath later, he was ready.

It was Saturday night—the classic night for couples. Downstairs in the basement, his parents and sister were gathered around the dinner table.

""Let me look at you,"" his mom said warmly. ""Very handsome. If you weren't my son, I might just fall for you myself.""

""No tie?"" his dad asked, glancing up from his beef stew with a teasing grin.

""Nah, no tie,"" Andre replied. ""It's just dinner at New Corners. Don't want to come off too eager.""

His dad smirked. ""Maybe your mom and I will swing by incognito to check how your date's going.""

""Yeah, right,"" Andre laughed, heading for the door.

This time, the nerves weren't as sharp as they'd been when he'd taken Dean's cousin Elizabeth out. He already knew Linda. They'd met at Ernie Barry's, shared drinks, talked, even danced. Since then, there had been a few phone calls, enough to make this feel easy.

He hopped on the Belt Parkway toward Marine Park, where Linda lived with her mom,  just a few blocks from Mary's folks' house.

Upstairs, Linda slipped into a loose gray dress that fell just below her knees—comfortable, elegant, and perfectly her. She carried a few extra pounds and stood just shy of average height, but her warm smile and sparkling personality made her light up any room.

They probably wouldn't have met at all if Gerry hadn't practically pushed them together at Ernie Barry's. But from that first conversation, something had clicked.

Linda had planned a quiet night with Mary and their friends. Andre had figured it would be iced teas and going home alone. Fate—and Gerry's meddling—had other plans.

Andre pulled into the driveway, took a breath, and rang the doorbell.

""Hello! Come on in,"" greeted a plump, cheerful woman with Linda's same bright smile.

""I'm Linda's mom—Mary's Aunt Terry. I hear you're Gerry's pal.""

""Yes, I am,"" Andre replied, shaking her hand a little awkwardly. ""Gerry and I go way back.""

Just then, Linda came bounding down the stairs. ""I could hear you from my room and figured I'd better hustle down before Mom talks your ear off.""

""Nah, we were just getting started,"" Terry said with a laugh.

Linda looped her arm through Andre's, kissed her mom on the cheek, and said, ""Don't wait up, Ma. I'll see you in the morning.""

""Okay, I won't. Have fun, you two,"" Terry called. ""Andre, it was nice meeting you!""

""Same here. Hopefully, we'll chat more next time,"" Andre replied with a smile.

⸻

Andre parked across from New Corner in a diagonal spot—his go-to place for family dinners. He walked around to open Linda's door and offered his hand as she stepped down from the truck. Her fingers stayed wrapped around his as they crossed the street.

New Corner was family-owned, the warmth of it visible in every detail—framed family photos on the walls, soft lighting, and thick carpeting that made the place feel like home.

Gino greeted them with a smile and led them to a cozy table. Andre pulled out Linda's chair before sitting down.

""We've got three specials tonight,"" Gino said. ""Red snapper with buttery sauce, chicken Francese with potatoes and mixed vegetables, and prime rib with broccoli rabe. What can I get started for drinks?""

""I'll have a Budweiser,"" Andre said.

""Same for me,"" Linda added.

The busboy set down water and a basket of warm bread.

""I love your shirt, Andre,"" Linda said. ""You look so handsome.""

""Thanks,"" he replied, grinning. ""You're looking beautiful, as always—even if this is only our second time meeting.""

Linda laughed. ""Good one.""

She tapped the menu. ""I think I'll go with the tortellini Alfredo. I'm a sucker for Alfredo sauce.""

""I love it too,"" Andre said. ""But I never order it out. I make it at home—it's incredible. Restaurants can't compete.""

""Big talk!"" Linda teased. ""Guess I'll skip it tonight and hold you to making it for me sometime.""

Gino returned with their beers. Andre ordered two prime ribs with broccoli rabe, and Linda nodded her approval.

""You're quite the Renaissance man, Mr. Andre,"" Linda teased. ""Hunter, handyman, and now chef? I'm surprised some girl hasn't snatched you up.""

Andre chuckled. ""That's what everyone says—especially Gerry. Guess the right girl hasn't come along yet.""

Linda tilted her head, playful. ""Well, we'll see about that.""

Dinner arrived on a silver tray, the prime rib perfectly pink and juicy. Linda tried broccoli rabe for the first time—bitter at first, but by the end, she'd warmed to it.

""This feels like a wedding feast,"" Andre joked.

Linda laughed. ""The food, maybe. But I don't see a dance floor.""

Andre leaned back, satisfied. ""I'm stuffed.""

""I feel just right,"" Linda said. ""This meal did not disappoint.""

Andre met her gaze. ""Nothing about tonight has.""

""Mary invited us for a nightcap,"" Linda said. ""What do you think?""

""I'm too mellow for a club,"" Andre said with a grin. ""I'm in.""

Linda called Mary from the payphone up front. Andre paid the check while she waited.

""She says to come over,"" Linda said when she returned. ""They're watching an old movie Gerry rented from Blockbuster.""

They walked out hand in hand.

⸻

Andre parked in front of Gerry and Mary's apartment. The three-flight climb worked off a bit of dinner, though they were laughing and slightly breathless by the top.

Mary flung open the door. ""Come on in, you guys!""

Andre kissed her cheek. Gerry stood, hugging Linda.

""I picked up some B&B today,"" Gerry said with a grin. ""Figured you'd want your go-to.""

""Perfect,"" Andre replied.

Mary tugged Linda into the kitchen while Andre sank onto the couch.

""So?"" Mary asked. ""How was it?""

Linda's smile was soft, glowing. ""Oh, Mary, it was amazing. Better than amazing. I think I'm in love.""

In the living room, Gerry leaned toward Andre. ""Well?""

Andre's grin said everything. ""Best night of my life. I think I'm in love.""

Mary and Linda returned with the B&B and four cognac glasses. Gerry poured and raised his glass.

""To Andre and Linda's first date,"" he said warmly. ""May it be the first of many.""

Glasses clinked. The amber liquid caught the light, and the night felt like the start of something real.

Chapter 24- May December 

That same night, Big Kenny held court at Studio 54's velvet rope, his massive frame filling the doorway like a bouncer carved from granite.

Elaine and her friend Keira approached, and Kenny's stern face cracked into a grin. He pulled Elaine into a bear hug, then turned to Keira with the same easy warmth.

""Elaine! Glad you made it. The place is electric tonight—you two are in for a hell of a ride.""

""We wouldn't miss it,"" Elaine said, beaming. ""Kenny, meet Keira. She's my neighbor from the building.""

Keira, another forty-something divorcee, looked stunning in a backless black mini dress that hugged her curves and turned heads. ""I've dreamed of this place for years. Thank you so much for getting us in.""

""My pleasure,"" Kenny rumbled, squeezing Elaine's hand. ""Elaine and I are good friends. You ladies have a blast.""

""Will you join us for a drink later?"" Elaine asked, tilting her head.

""Count on it,"" Kenny said. ""I'll track you down inside. Right now, I'm everywhere at once.""

Elaine flashed him one last smile, linked arms with Keira, and stepped through the doors. The club swallowed them in a rush of pulsing lights, thumping bass, and glittering bodies—Studio 54 in all its decadent glory.

They threaded through the crush to the massive oval bar that wrapped the dance floor like a halo. Keira leaned in first, ordering a screwdriver for Elaine and a rum-and-coke for herself. The bartender—twenty-something, cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass—slid the drinks across with a slow, appreciative grin and a wink that lingered.

Glasses clinked. They sipped, then drifted to the floor's edge, letting the scene wash over them. They'd danced in plenty of clubs, but Studio 54 was a fever dream: strobes slicing the dark, bodies orbiting in sequined constellations, the air thick with perfume and possibility.

They plunged in.

Elaine and Keira moved in sync, hips rolling, drinks balanced on straws. A guy with a lion's mane of hair materialized beside Keira, leaning close to murmur something lost under the bass.

His hand settled low on her back, guiding her into a slow grind. She tossed back the last of her rum-and-coke, handed the empty glass to a passing tray, and looped her arms around his neck, drawing him so tight she might as well have been wearing him.

Elaine signaled the waitress for another drink and kept dancing. Overhead, a giant screen descended like a curtain call, Billy Idol snarling through White Wedding. The speakers thundered, the floor vibrated, and the night swallowed them whole.

Elaine spun around—no Keira, no lion. She shrugged, threaded back to the bar, and drained the fresh screwdriver in one sweet, electric gulp. Heaven. She signaled for another.

A twenty slid across the bar beside her.

""I've got this,"" a voice said.

The bartender lifted an eyebrow. ""For you, sir?""

""Scotch, rocks.""

The man turned to Elaine. ""I'm Doug."" He took her hand, warm and sure. ""That dress is lethal—you're killing it.""

The silver fabric clung to her like liquid mercury, stopping just above the knee, lifting and hugging every curve. Doug leaned in, cheek brushing hers, his breath warm against her ear as he spoke over the pounding music.

He laced his fingers through hers and led her back to the floor. Elaine raised her arms, palms open. Doug met them with his own, skin to skin, and they swayed—slow, deliberate, perfectly in time.

A waitress glided past. Doug flagged her down. ""Shot of scotch, shot of vodka."" She returned in seconds. He handed Elaine the vodka. They clinked, tilted, swallowed. Fire met ice, and the night burned brighter.

""Let's hit the balcony. Need a breather,"" Doug said, draping an arm over her shoulder and guiding her up the narrow stairs.

At the rail, he flagged a waitress. Two shots appeared—scotch for him, vodka for her. They clinked, swallowed, and sank onto low velvet theater seats. Doug stretched his arm along the backrest, fingers brushing her bare shoulder.

Below, the floor pulsed like a living thing; above, a massive screen flashed MTV in strobe-lit silence.

Elaine's head floated. She'd lost count after the third drink. Keira was surely gone—either dragging her lion back to Fort Lee or vanishing into his lair. They'd agreed on separate cabs if the night split them; practical, considering the haze.

""Best seat in the house,"" Doug murmured, nodding at the view.

She barely heard. Instead, she turned, cupped his face, and kissed him—slow, hungry, tasting smoke and scotch.

Minutes blurred. Then the room tilted, her limbs went liquid, and words slurred into nonsense.

Doug pulled back, eyes narrowing. ""Later,"" he muttered, and melted into the crowd.

Elaine's head lolled against the cushion. She closed her eyes—just a second—and the ceiling spun like a carousel. She'd partied hard before, but never this fast, this deep.

When the spinning sharpened, she forced her eyes open, gripped the rail, and staggered down the stairs, one careful step at a time.

She hit the main floor and sagged against a chrome pole, the room tilting like a ship in a storm. A voice cut through the haze.

""Elaine. Been hunting for you all night. You okay?""

She blinked up at Kenny, grinned wide, and spun a lazy finger in the air. ""Weeee...""

He barked a laugh. ""Yeah, you had a real good time. Too good."" He glanced toward the exit. ""Your girl's long gone—took off with some Teddy Boy. Come on, let's get you a cab.""

She looped an arm over his shoulder; he steadied her with a firm hand at the small of her back and steered her through the crowd. Outside, the night air slapped her awake. She tugged him close, lips brushing his ear, murmuring an invitation back to Fort Lee.

He wanted it—God, he did—but not like this. Their moment would come. Just not tonight.

Kenny hailed a yellow cab and eased her into the back seat.

""Poo,"" she pouted, patting the empty space beside her.

He handed the driver a twenty. ""Fort Lee. Make sure she gets inside safe.""

""No sweat, pal. I've hauled worse.""

Kenny leaned in for a quick goodnight. Elaine caught his mouth in a slow, sloppy kiss, tasting of vodka and gratitude.

""Thanks for taking care of me,"" she whispered.

The cab merged into traffic and vanished into the bright lights of Manhattan.

Kenny stood on the curb, touched two fingers to his lips, and smiled into the dark.
Another time. Just not tonight.
