I've only begun to experiment with it and it works pretty good but it's still rough around the edges. There are 3 lora's, one for portraits, another for local editing and a subject context.

First example I used an image of myself wearing a superman shirt drinking coffee, pretty decent, works like a face swapper, similar to Pulid

2nd & 5th image was using the subject lora to put my logo on an object, not perfect but decent. I'm still learning how to use it.

3rd image was just a simple local edit adding sunglasses to superman

4th image using the subject lora and the same superman image to put him on a skateboard. The positioning is weird but...you get the idea.

  
I'm still wrapping my head around how these Lora's work, check out Sebastian's video and for the workflow for the portrait lora. I'll be making a video once I get more familiar with it. 

It's still in early development so it's not perfect but show great potential. It's sort of like having a lora with one image.

[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/s/T5R6Z45ao5)

“MOVE MOVE MOVE” Henry yelled as he and Althaea raced across the dungeon’s winding tunnels and hallways. Racing forward, Althaea quickly reached into their satchel before chucking a flask of holy water that they had purchased before entering the dungeon behind them. The simple glass flask swiftly sailed across the air before shattering against the thick skull of one of the skeletons chasing them who quickly crumbled and crashed into a pile of ancient bones and rusted equipment. 

“That was our last one Henry. You still think we can take them?” Much to Althaea’s poorly hidden amusement, Henry stubbornly grunted in frustration before he twisted around and slammed his halberd into the chest of one of the now ten remaining skeletons. Turning back towards Althaea, Henry returned to his sprint as the mob of bones chased after them without so much as a moment of hesitation at the sudden destruction of their comrade. Then again they were skeletons so that was to be expected.

The chase was further disgruntled by the fact that a couple of the skeletons began throwing various discarded weapons or occasionally a sharpened pieces of bone matter which crashed all across the hallway. Henry yelped in pain as a dull dagger stabbed through his chainmail and into his upper back but continued forward regardless. Thankfully it would seem that Althaea had managed to locate the exit as they ducked around a corner before shouting in excitement as they spotted the faint glow of light emanating from the staircase out of the dungeon. 

Quickly stopping to cast a spell which summoned a large net of spider’s webs all across the charging mob of skeletons behind Henry, Althaea waved the human forward up the stairs that would lead them out of the dungeon. The spell seemed to have great effect as the majority suddenly became entangled by the magical string and those who managed to escape were slowed down enough to allow for Henry’s expeditious escape. Quickly reaching the top of the stairs and emerging out of the dungeon to the sight of the open grassy plains, Henry and Althaea let out a sigh of relief as they slammed the door to the catacombs shut.

Slumping down against the hill wall that the entrance to the dungeon was built up against, Althaea helped Henry pull out the many foreign objects stuck in his armor and occasionally his body while a small potion of healing was acquired and swiftly drained. Setting his helmet on the ground and rubbing his eyes, Henry let out a momentous sigh which managed to convey an entire dungeon crawls worth of strain. “What I would give to have a cleric on stand by.” Silently, Althaea nodded before grabbing a signal flare and calling for a pick up cart. 

— — —

“Alright, here’s your stop lad and lassie. Althaea, make sure to give Henry a good smack in the head if he picks another dungeon crawl.” Said Copperworth as he stopped his cart and dropped off the pair. “Will do,” Althaea gleefully responded as Henry grumbled to himself before entering the guild hall with his elf companion in tow. Handing over the quest paper to the clerk waiting at their desk, Henry gestured to Althaea who quickly produced the cursed amulet that they were sent to grab. Nodding their head in affirmation, the clerk quickly stamped the guild’s seal of approval before ushering the pair out of the way.

Swiftly handing over the completed quest and the cursed amulet to the quartermaster, the two received their payment and before they began spending a few minutes perusing the guild shop. Eventually they settled and acquired a few potions of healing and a new pair of gloves after Althaea’s old pair began whispering things in abyssal. Apparently grabbing the cursed amulet out of its less than holy container was not good for someone's gloves. As they concealed the purchase, Althaea let out a sigh as the quartermaster threw the corrupted gloves into an incinerator.

“I actually quite liked that pair.” Henry patted the pouting elf girl on the shoulder. “We tried what we could to save them. Shame pouring one of our bottles of holy water on it did not work but I’m sure your new pair will be just as good.” Walking out of the guild store and back to their shared room, Henry quickly flopped down onto his bed while Althaea sat down on hers while nibbling a bit on a piece of bread. Resting his head against the rather soft pillow, Henry turned to Althaea before clearing his throat which served its purpose of grabbing the elf’s attention. 

“So, what kind of quest do you want to go on next?” At this, Althaea canted their head in thought before eventually chewing the last of their bread. “Well the last few quests have been a bit much. Two monster hunts and a dungeon crawl this week feels like a bit too much action for me. I think that we should take it easy this time.” Henry considered Althaea’s words for a moment as they began polishing his helmet out of habit before responding. “Alright, how about a simple escort quest? Most of the time nothing happens and when things do it’s usually just a stray beast or desperate bandit.” 

Althaea cupped their chin in their hand as they considered the suggestion before nodding their head in approval which Henry acknowledged. “Alright then, it’s settled. In the morning I’ll check the quest board and see if there’s anyone who’s hiring caravan guards or escorts. Now get some sleep, I don’t want to have to carry you if you drop unconscious while we're on the road.” And with that Henry quickly doused the candle quickly plunging the room into darkness.

— — —

Waking up in the morning, Althaea crawled out of bed and looked to their right to find that Henry’s bed was empty. Concluding that he had gotten up early as usual, Althaea swiftly corrected their mild bed head before changing into some proper, presentable clothes. Opening the door and making their way down to the guild chow hall, Althaea’s stomach growled in anticipation as the scent of freshly made eggs filled her nose. Reaching the large open room quickly enough, she swiftly got herself a platter of eggs and toasted bread before eventually she spotted where Henry was sitting. Walking over, Althaea noticed that he was conversing with an aged priest wearing an insignia denoting them to be a follower of Lathander. 

From what Althaea was able to recall, Lathander was on the morally good side of deities and many of their followers were poised to assist and give charity. Personally Althaea found that they were a bit naive in their belief that they could help everyone but they were doing a lot more than a few other religious orders that she could name. Spotting his companion, Henry waved Althaea over to the table before turning his attention back to the Lathander priest with a cup of the blackish substance that the man seemed addicted to in his hand.

Taking a swig of coffee, Henry quickly finished whatever business with the priest as the old man got up from the table and walked off before Althaea reached within earshot of the conversation. Setting down her platter, the elven girl looked at Henry with a questioning raise of her eyebrow which Henry quickly noticed. “Ah, that. Well it would seem I have managed to secure that escort quest that you wanted. Torald, the priest I was talking to, along with a handful of their followers were going to take a trip down to the neighboring city to do a bit of charity work. As such they would like a small escort for their trip.”

Althaea nodded her head as they began scooping up some of the eggs into her mouth which was quickly followed by a piece of the toasted bread. Clearing her throat, Althaea quickly looked over to Henry. “Why would they need an escort for that? It’s only a day or two’s cart ride straight to get to the next closest city and I seriously doubt that bandits would stoop so low to attack the one group that would even consider helping them out. Not to mention the fact that this kind of job is what church paladins are for.” Henry for his part let out a little chuckle and muttered “you’d be surprised” at the bandit part under his breath before shrugging his shoulders.

“Torald said that it always pays to be a little cautious when it comes to traversing the wilderness, even if they don’t plan on traveling off of the marked trail. As for the paladin part, it would seem that their assigned paladins were either working on some important duties or were still being trained fully. Regardless, it’s the simple and easy job you wanted so it’s up to you if you still want to take it. Another dungeon crawl is always on the table after all.” 

At this proclamation, Althaea did as Copperworth had suggested and playfully hit Henry upside the head with the palm of her hand before firmly stating that “Nope, we're taking the escort quest whether you want to or not.” Henry quickly raised his hand to rub at the spot which Althaea had hit before nodding his head in agreement. “Alright then, I’ll go tell Torald the good news. If I recall correctly they were planning on leaving in an hour so finish up your food sooner rather than later.”

— — — 

Linking back up with Henry after finishing her meal, Althaea was able to quickly spot the armored man amongst the small lake of robed followers of Lathander with the light of the sun reflecting off of the freshly washed plate helmet. Walking over, Althaea found Henry swiftly stowing his pack full of the essential survival gear and rations that he always insisted on bringing along. Not that Althaea was complaining, the items stuffed in that pack had gotten them out of some rather tight pinches that would have been rather unpleasant if Henry had not brought whatever niche tool or item along.

Taking a moment to sneak up on the busy human, Althaea was mildly disappointed when, right as she was about to spook him, Henry whipped his head around to look straight at her. “Ah, you’ll have to do better than that. Come on, let’s get your gear stocked so that we can move out.” With a slight pout the elven mage complied with Henry’s instructions as they placed the few amenities that were too large to be stuffed into her enchanted satchel onto the cart’s bed. Chief among them being a sleeping pack that Henry had practically forced Althaea to buy after their first quest together. 

It was a relatively simple thing, having a leather exterior and wool inner coating, but much to Althaea’s gratification it made sleeping after a long march significantly more comfortable. As she was about to step up and sit down in the cart, Henry grabbed Althaea’s forearm and when she looked back at him he shook his head. “Unfortunately, we are the guards here. This means that our job is to walk on the sides of the carts and make sure that any bandits or beasts notice our presence.” Sighing in partial upsetness while also having expected this, Althaea dropped back to the ground and took up position on the right side of the middle most cart with Henry taking the other.   

A few moments after the two had taken up their escorting positions the head priest quickly called out to their fellows who swiftly finished their packing before piling into the three carts assigned to the caravan. With that, the caravan’s designated drivers quickly snapped the reins of their horses and began to tumble down the road towards the next city over with the adventuring pair at their sides. 

— — —

The sun was beginning to set when the caravan decided that it was time to stop the carts and prepare to rest for the night. Quickly maneuvering the carts into a circle so that they would break up the wind, Henry and Althaea helped the priests quickly set up a decently sized bonfire while those proficient in cooking began preparing the night’s meals. As Henry was about to acquire a bit more firewood with the small handaxe he had packed for this expressed purpose, his trained ears picked up a subtle mechanical clicking sound coming from one of the robed followers sitting around the now burning bonfire. 

Walking over to see what kind of mechanical trinket was making such noise, Henry sat down on one of the log benches before turning towards the man which the noise was emanating from. Tapping the person’s shoulder with his gauntlet, Henry was surprised to hear the familiar clank of metal against metal before the being turned and pulled off the hood which obscured their face. 

“A warforged!?” Henry exclaimed with unhidden surprise. The fully metal and mechanical man nodded their head in affirmation as they activated their voice box with a flick of a switch. “Yes, I am a warforged. Is that a problem sir?” The machine person said with a hint of annoyance at Henry’s surprise pertaining to his lineage which the man quickly took notice of as Henry shook his head in a frantic motion. “No, no, I just did not expect to see someone of your caliber among the priesthood of Lathander. Most warforged I have known have stuck to hazardous professions when relieved of duty so seeing you here was a bit of a shock.” 

At this explanation, the warforged’s single blue eye seemed to shrink slightly as if to mimic a squint of annoyance before nodding their head in understanding. “Yes, I am aware of my odd choice in comparison to my brethren, however it is my decision and I shall not be convinced to take up arms again.” Henry nodded their head in understanding as the warforged’s conviction was not uncommon for retired soldiers that he had met before. “Understood. My name’s Henry, could I know yours? Certainly would be better than me calling you the robed warforged.”

The being in question seemed to consider something for a moment before nodding their head in agreement that it would be better. “My original designation was R3T0 but the priests and followers here always call me Reto so I suppose you may refer to me as that as well.” With that Henry nodded his head with a smile as he held out his hand to the warforged man. “Alright then, nice to meet you Reto. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.” Reto quickly returned the handshake with a firm grip that Henry could respect before stating that the feeling was likewise. 

Getting up from the log he was sitting on, Henry quickly gave Reto a half assed one handed salute before walking off towards Althaea who was using her magic to drain a decently sized branch of its moisture. Watching as the elven mage smacked her human companion for making her do all the work, Reto quietly squeezed his hand shut which caused the fist to restructure itself into the familiar shape of a mace. At this, Reto quickly shook his head and released his grip with a sigh. “Not again. I’m not a war machine anymore. I don’t have to fight anyone ever again.”

— — —

The sun’s cresting of the horizon was quickly followed by the rise of the various caravaneers and priests who quickly began deconstructing the makeshift camp or eating a hearty breakfast. Having been awake a full 30 minutes before almost everyone else, Henry was already packed and ready to go which meant that he had plenty of time to help Althaea get through their usual wake up routine of asking for an extra five minutes a half dozen times. Forcefully dragging Althaea out of her sleeping bag and towards one of the log seats where the priests were eating breakfast, Henry quickly waved at Reto who returned the greeting with a quick nod of acknowledgement. 

Last night when Henry was taking his first of two three hour shifts on watch duty, he had spotted the warforged sitting by the dying bonfire keeping an eye on everything while the others were asleep. Henry had struck up a quick conversation with Reto which eventually led to Henry taking up a patrol on one side of the camp while Reto watched the other. While the two did not talk all too much on the guard shifts that Henry had that night, they seemed to appreciate the others' presence nonetheless. 

Placing a plate of dried meat and eggs on Althaea’s lap, Henry quickly went back to packing up his elven companion’s belongings for the last leg of their journey. By the time that he had finished packing and loading both of their supplies, the rest of the caravan was ready and waiting to move out. At this point Althaea had woken up fully and, despite the urge to crawl into one of the carts and take a nap, was ready to begin the march once again. Taking up his position like last time, Henry gave the lead caravaneer a nod of confirmation which they correctly assumed was their que to begin the last leg of their journey.

— — —

Letting the sun wash over herself as she marched, Althaea was actually feeling quite good today. Yesterday they had not had to do anything more strenuous than march which she had actually gotten rather used to in the last couple of months as an adventurer. She doubted that she could do so in a full suit of metal armor like Henry but he had a full decade to get accustomed to that level of weight on him so she felt fairly good about herself. Regardless, yesterday was quite nice as she was able to properly take things easy for the first time in a few weeks and the goblet of nicely aged wine she had last night had been the cherry on top. 

Looking around at the wilderness surrounding them, she noticed that the many chirping birds and rustling rodents had all disappeared from the chorus of background noises that the forest usually produced ad nauseum. Remembering Henry’s advice about when such things occur, Althaea quickly began scanning the trees for any large specimens of wildlife that could be causing the rest of the animals to be so cautious. Eventually a glint of light managed to catch Althaea’s attention but as she opened her mouth to yell out a warning an arrow was shot out and slammed into the front most cart diver’s chest. 

From the other side of the cart Althaea was walking beside, Henry let out a bellow of “AMBUSH!” which served to galvanize the caravaneer’s who quickly pulled out short swords and crossbows to face whoever was attacking them. A few of the priests inside of the cart’s also popped their heads out of the cart but given that they were unarmed they would only be able to help patch up the wounded. Turning back to where she initially saw the glint of light, Althaea only had a moment to realize it was now pointed straight at her before she dropped to her stomach.

The arrow thankfully missed her and dug itself into the wooded frame of the cart she was standing next to. Pulling out her arcane focus and quickly spewing a pair of magically infused fire bolts at the source of the arrow, however instead of a scream of burning pain like she expected, Althaea only heard a familiar clatter of bones as a skeleton marched out of the forest. Along with the skeleton who just shot their arrow, a pair of helmeted zombies wearing insignia long faded and forgotten as well as another bow carrying skeleton emerged from the forest with hostile intent.

A caravaneer next to her shot out a crossbow bolt into the chest of one of the zombies before receiving a rusted arrow as reward from one of the skeletons while both zombies charged undaunted with worn short swords in hand. Quickly shifting her hand in a familiar motion, Althaea sent out gouts of flames that splashed over the two zombies which caused large chunks of their flesh to char and fall off their rotting bodies. Ducking down as another arrow narrowly missed her skull, Althaea quickly began casting a magical set of armored plates to protect herself while another caravaneer with a sword clashed with one of the zombies that had not been killed by the scorching heat. 

— — —

Over on the other side of the carts, Henry was having a bit of a harder time as one absolute unit of a zombie barred down against him. Dodging to the side, Henry quickly slashed at the zombies leg with his halberd before blocking a pair of arrows that slammed into his armored forearm, thankfully not piercing anything too deeply. Backpedaling a few paces, Henry quickly scanned the berserking zombie’s body for potential weak points however unfortunately he found none. With large, muscular arms and thick, powerful legs, the zombie cut an impressive figure which would have been desirable if their muscles still had all of its skin to cover it all.

The only thing with normal proportions on the unit was its relatively normal head which looked comically small on the rest of its body. Dropping down and rolling to the left as the zombie in question attempted to grapple him, Henry was quickly running through his options before a scream of panic sounded out towards the back of the convoy. Turning his head, Henry could see two fully armored knights with dark, unreadable insignia plastered on their chest. Both of them practically exuded power as they began walking off with three knocked out priests, one of which was Torald, the head priest. 

Henry was about to chase after them before the hulking zombie he was fighting threw a devastating blow straight into Henry’s gut causing him to be thrown back a few paces. Hacking up a bit of blood inside of his helmet, Henry was about to attempt to disengage from combat with the berserker and begin to chase after the armored zombies when Reto burst out of the middle cart. Sprinting with all the speed which his warforged body could allow, Reto managed to quickly close the distance to the knight holding Torald when said knight drew their shortsword. Turning around with an almost casual pace, the dark knight thrusted their short sword deep into the warforged’s chest with almost unreasonable speed and power.

As Reto dropped to the ground, the sword still in him, the two knights shared a look between them before they dismissively walked away into the forest with their kidnaped priests. “Shit, this situation just gets better and better,” Henry thought to himself out loud as he reached behind his back before pulling out a long but rather thin scroll that was dyed red and had a blazing emblem imprinted on it. Jumping back as the brute crashed down onto the ground he had occupied a moment before, Henry quickly wrapped the red scroll around the shaft of his halberd. Quickly finishing it off with a tight knot, the head of the halberd quickly began glowing hot with magical energy as the temporary enchantment scroll did its duty. “Looks like I’ll need to thank Garand when I get back. Alright you fracker, COME AT ME!” 

As if enraged by the taunt, the berserker zombie dug their hands and feet into the ground before launching itself forward with thunderous speed. Waiting for the perfect moment, Henry deftly dodged to the side and in the same motion brought his trusty halberd up into the perfect position to strike the unguarded back of the beast which shot past him. Bringing the blade down, the zombie’s flesh quickly erupted in magical fire which served to wreak havoc in addition to the already brutal blow. The berserker's body spasmed for a moment before eventually relaxing completely for the second time in its false life.

Retching his halberd out of the now very thoroughly dead berserker zombie, Henry turned and found that the battle had pretty much concluded. Looking around, Henry was able to piece together the fact that, for whatever reason, the undead monsters had fallen back into the forest by the time he had finished off the berserker. It would also seem that nobody on his side of the caravan was dead, although a couple were making spirited attempts to change that fact. Dashing over to the other side of the cart where Althaea was guarding, Henry was immensely relieved to see that they too had made it out alive. 

Despite Althaea complaining about how much the arrow embedded in her leather shoulder pad had hurt, Henry concluded that they would be fine for the time being and they would be even better once a priest can look over the wound. Hefting the elven mage to their feet and tossing them a small vial containing a health potion, Henry sprinted over to the kneeling form of Reto as they, with much effort, pulled the short sword out of their own chest. Dropping down to one knee, Henry put a gauntleted hand on Reto’s shoulder to steady the warforged as they nearly collapsed to the ground. 

“Must … protect … charge. Damage … sustained. Must … protect … charge.” Reto mumbled out through their voice box as they tried and failed to get up out of the kneeling position they were in. “Woah there buddy. You’ve taken quite a bit of damage, you won't be doing anything for a while. Don’t worry, I’ll call in a scout party and they will find and save head priest Torald.” Henry quickly turned back to go and grab his travel pack holding all of his emergency flares to summon a party from the local adventuring guild when Reto muttered something that Henry did not quite catch. 

“Say again?” Henry asked as Reto pressed his right hand on his chest wound before a bright, holy light began enveloping the injury. Henry watched as Reto’s stab wound mended together until eventually there was only the faint discoloration of metal left to suggest the injury ever existed. “May lathander be with me.” At this provocation, Reto got up from the ground and began marching towards the direction which the dark knights had left without another word. Glancing between the walking off warforged, the caravan Henry was still being paid to protect, and Althaea who seemed just as conflicted as he was, the decision of whether or not to stay was quickly ended as the voice of the caravan caravan master appeared behind him. 

“Get after them and find those kidnapped priests. I’ll handle getting my caravan and the remaining priests to the city. After all, my reputation as a caravan master would be in ruins if it gets out that my employer was captured and I did nothing about it.” Both Althaea and Henry nodded their heads in acknowledgement before quickly grabbing what equipment they had left in the carts. Completing this, the pair quickly jogged after the Reto who just hit the first layer of trees of the forest. Turning to Henry, Althaea grinned as they looked him in the eye and attempted to mimic his voice. “‘Most of the time nothing happens’ huh? Load of shit that was. I guess we’ll never get a break. Oh well, come on, there's no time to waste.”

1ienw5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/aromantic/comments/1ienw5n/aromantic_spectrum_but_i_dont_know_where/,Aromantic spectrum but I don't know where?,"HAI, I'm new here, but I've been exploring my identity since I was 15, and I'm still so confused. I've known that I'm queer for a while now, but I've gone through SO MANY LABELS trying to figure out where I fit. As soon as I try to settle down on a label, something shifts and it's completely wrong. (this might be a long post so beware)

I'm not gonna talk about WHO I'm attracted to, just the attraction in general. 

FREQUENCY: I do not know if I have ever felt romantic attraction. I have had ""crushes"", but now I realize they may have just been admirations, NOT romantic feelings. I don't get ""crushes"" very often. I've had them in 2nd grade, 4th/5th grade, 7th grade, 10th grade, 10th grade again, and MAYBE 12th grade. 

Crush one was on a boy named Theo, (I don't remember much) I just know he was funny and popular so 8 year old me thought it was OBVIOUSLY romantic. I think if I knew him now we would be friends or aquaintances, but nothing more. 

Crush two was a boy named Jonathan who was low-key annoying, but my friends liked people so I guess I wanted someone to like too. I remember him teasing me, and me teasing him back, but I don't think there was any ""spark"". I think I thought of him as a cool person because he was ALSO popular. I don't think I would look twice at him if I knew him now.

Crush three was a boy named Keith who was tall and one of the class clowns. He was in my friend group and I wanted to hang out with him a lot because he was a likeable person. If I knew him now, I think we would be good friends or mutual friends, but I wouldn't think of him romantically. 

Crush four was a whopping THREE years later, it was a girl named Kaitlyn in the year above me. She looked so pretty and her vibes were nice so I wanted to be friends with her. My way of introducing myself was asking her a question, but she was incredibly confused and I got embarrassed and immediately lost feelings, which is why I think this was an admiration, not a crush. I thought she was cool, but she hurt my feelings so she wasn't cool anymore. I don't think I would interact if I knew her now. I also learned she had a girlfriend at the time, and I MIGHT'VE been jealous? But it was more of a bummed out feeling than a jealous feeling.

Crush five was the same year, a few months later, on a girl named Cristina. She very BOLDLY introduced me by standing two inches from my face and asking what I was doing. I was nervous but I think it was just me being flustered because she was so close 😭 I tried to get to know her better in the following weeks after getting her number, but she replied late or not at all so I got bored and lost feelings. (I ended up hearing some negative things about her that put me off too) I would make small talk if I knew her now, but I don't think I'd view her romantically. 

POSSIBLE crush six was on my friend Audrey. I saw her at the bus stop looking so cool, and I ended up talking to her and we became friends. I might have been crushing but I think it was platonic. I wanted to cuddle and that was about it, I wanted to call her my girlfriend, but the kissing and ""romantic things"" didn't cross my mind. When she started dating my friend, I was happy for her, maybe a TINY bit jealous, but again, it was more of a bummed out feeling, like ""Aww, okay. That's fine."" We're still friends, she's still dating my other friend, I don't feel jealous.

NOW, my problem is that I have no idea if any of those were actual crushes, or if it was admiration/aesthetic attraction, liking their personality, or just wanting to be friends. I definitely think before high school it was just liking their personality and wanting to be friends because they were popular, but I don't know after that. When I think of romantic relationships, I WANT THAT FOR ME, I want someone to cuddle with and call my partner, someone I can hold hands with and hang out with all the time. But I realize this may just be platonic attraction with a little extra? 

I'm not particularly fond of the romantic compliments like ""you're eyes are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" or ""you're so pretty when \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" because regular compliments will do fine. If someone complimented me romantically, I don't think I'd be comfortable. I would be something like ""Oh yeah, aha, thanks?"" OVERALL AWKWARD/CRINGE FOR ME. 😭

With romantic gestures, I'm neutral about it. When looking at lists of them, they just seem like nice things to do for someone. I'm not understanding what is so ""romantic"" about it, because I would do most of those for anyone I loved enough.

When I think of scenarios when ""someone in the coffee shop is asking you out, how do you react?"" I don't think I would be up for it. I have social anxiety and a stranger wants to DATE ME? I'm good, sorry, thanks though. 😭 (but also maybe it just depends?? this hasn't happened to me before) If I think of someone I know asking me out, I wouldn't be up for it either, because I don't think of anyone I know in that way. If someone asked me out, I would feel nervous, but the BAD nervous, not butterflies. I would likely have a lot of anxiety after. (but this hasn't happened before, my irl reaction might be different depending on the situation!!)

The labels I've identified with the most are cupioromantic and quoiromantic (aka wtfromantic)

How I relate to cupioromantic: I DO WANT A RELATIONSHIP, and I don't feel the attraction. THE PROBLEM is that I don't KNOW if I feel the attraction. I haven't felt enough of it to have a definite answer, and I don't want to just assume.

How I relate to quoiromantic: I do not understand what romantic attraction feels like, because I don't know if I have experienced it at all. I understand platonic attraction, because I have friends that I love and I would miss them if they were gone. I would get over them, but I would still miss them. 

I kind of understand the concept of dating? You go somewhere nice, talk and get to know the other person. But you could do the same thing with a friend you're getting to know? I don't know if I know what I'm talking about anymore. But it seems that things are only romantic if you CALL them romantic.

My brain is fried from writing all of this so I may have forgot some things, I can clarify things if needed. 😭ANYWAY, if anyone has suggestions/advice/etc. I'm totally open!

1ienvub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/1ienvub/building_cltgigs_in_public_free_headshots_need/,Building CLTGigs in Public – Free Headshots + Need Your Thoughts!," 
Hey Charlotte!  
  
Quick intro: I’m a recent UNCC grad who’s been quietly building **CLT Gigs** – a platform to help Charlotte find gigs, freelancers, volunteers, or even people to handle their random ""I need a thing!"" requests. Think of it as your side hustle hub, but less corporate, more community. I also hope it can be a centralized search engine for nonprofits to find volunteers as well, since that is big for me.  
  
**Why I’m posting?**  
I’m trying to “build in public” – sharing progress, wins, and fails as I go and to build something the community actually wants. Here’s the latest:  
  
**The Platform:**  
  
- **What it is:** A place to post services you offer _or_ requests for help (e.g., ""I need a photographer Saturday"" or ""I tutor math – $30/hr"").  
- **What makes it unique?** You can basically get a website/portfolio for your company for free even if you don't use the platform to get 'gigs'- I'm working on a 'Community Card' feature that allows you make a linktree/portfolio for your service and you can just share that with potential customers. You can post volunteer events. You can report posts/people. You can review others and check reviews.  
  
- **What I'm not doing** No service or matching fees. No platform payment service charge. Its a free market.  
  
- **Model:** Free to use _forever_ for all functionality. I'm planning on paying for it out of my pocket right now but I hope to run it either through donations or figure something out later.

  
  
**The Ask:**  

- **Feedback:** What’s missing in Charlotte’s gig economy? Need a way to find last-minute event staff? Wish there were more creative collabs? Hate the fees on existing apps? Literally anything.  
  
- **Beta testers:** Need people to poke holes in the platform. If you’ve ever cursed at gig apps, you’re qualified.  
  
- **Design/Dev Help:** My UI looks like it was designed in 2004. If you’re a Figma wizard or full-stack helper, slide into my DMs.  
  
- **Venue Partners:** I want to host a FREE Headshots event (I'll be taking headshots) at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or event space this fall for anyone job-hunting, career-pivoting, or just tired of their LinkedIn pic being a selfie. **Know a spot that’d donate space?** Let’s team up!  
  
  
**Why Bother?**  
Charlotte’s full of hustlers, creatives, and DIYers – but we’re all stuck scrolling through dead-end apps or Facebook groups. CLT Gigs is my attempt to fix that. Plus, the headshots event is my way of giving back. No strings, no sales pitch – just decent photos for people who need them.  
  
**Roast Me (Politely):**  
  
- What’s **annoyingly missing** from gig platforms here?  
  
- Would you post _and_ search on CLT Gigs, or is it one-sided?  
  
- What would make you actually **trust** a local platform over Uber-for-X?  
  
  
**What I have made so far:** [[Demo Images](https://imgur.com/a/31bXxRb/)] – Gig posting, Search, Community Cards, Portfolios, and a live Chat. – it’s still rough so reach to me if you have any questions, but the work is about 85% done. I've done most of the heavy lifting in the development work but I would need someone who is better than me to take a look at performance, security, and other tweaks. If anyone has any technical questions, DM me and I can provide a repo or demo link.

Let’s make this thing work for Charlotte. And if you’ve got a venue lead or want to collab on the headshots event, comment or DM me.  

  
_Mods – Not selling anything, just looking to help the community!_ 
 
  
**TL;DR:** Building a free gig/request platform for Charlotte. Hosting a free headshots event – need space. Beta testers, dev help, and marketing wanted.",1,1738353881.0,Charlotte,0,1.0,False

1ient03,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ient03/complete_beginner_looking_for_a_easy_to_use/,Complete beginner looking for a easy to use machine. Any suggestions? [$1000],"I'll preface this by stating that I am looking for a machine for around $1000 USD for my wife and I. We are not huge espresso enthusiasts and aren't really looking to get into a new hobby so I am looking at semi auto machines (I think most good full autos are out of my budget and the ones that are, have mostly poor reviews). We just want to drink the occasional latte a few times a week without a ton of effort. Since we have a toddler and a baby, dedication to learning the ins and outs of espresso that something like a full manual machine might require isn't really on want list. Our level of coffee drinking is Starbucks mostly.

With that said, I have landed on the Breville Barista Touch as a machine that seems to cover a lot of the wants I have such as - Built in grinder, auto milk frother, ability to save settings of specific drinks I make. Yes there is some manual parts to the process but they do not seem to be too laborious.

Is there any other machines I should be looking at? I am open to suggestions as my knowledge of machines with the features I am looking for is minimal. Thanks!",1,1738353683.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

She is dusky which is not my type but somehow i find her cute. I usually dont visit this particular office but fate had it. First time i saw her i couldn't take my eyes off. After a couple of days i mustered up courage and talked with her. We had friendly conversation, at last i asked for socials, she just nodded no without speaking. Then she went to her group of 15 friends, all of them were staring at me after i grabbed my coffee. I was nervous inside but outside I acted nonchalant and sat across them my back facing them. I have interacted with many girls but this was my first time in office where bare minimum expectation was socials and drive where the road leads. Since then We had few eye contacts which i mostly avoided. 


Should i approach her again? 
I was carrying conversation, i felt she was little bit confused, i couldn't hear some of the words she said. 
should have tried some banter?

Yikes. Both bags tasted like Peet's. They didn't even smell that good when I opened the bag.

1ienop0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ienop0/men_and_women_of_reddit_my_life_turned_180_i_cant/,Men and women of reddit. My life turned 180.  I can't rationalize what happened. (31M) (28F),"I've never posted any personal stuff on the web before but I'm exhausted and in dire need of unbiased insight on what the fuck went wrong with my relationship.  My fiance (28F) left me 6 months before our marriage.

I'm a 31 year old male. I'm in my final year of surgical residency, had a place that  was starting to feel like home and a beautiful, intelligent and caring woman to share my life with.

In spring of 2023 I had just ended a relationship that wasn't going anywhere, I was unhappy my partner was unhappy. I moved out and rented a place that made me feel comfortable. A week later I'm feeling good with myself, had shit ton of energy despite staying late to work.  
Then one call changed my life forever. I had to consult a patient in another ward. I go there and see the most beautiful creature I've laid my eyes upon - the resident cardiologist. I help the patient, she's assisting me. When we're done I ask her out for a cigarette break in the parking lot. We talk, we laugh and each of us goes back to work feeling a little better. A few days later she texts me, I ask her out for a walk and we hit it off.  Three weeks later we're a couple, I give her the keys to my place and tell her she can come and go as she wants, let it be her safe space from anyone and anything even when I'm not there. I had met her parents, she met mine.  
Fast forward three months later, we had just returned from a trip to the sea. And I'm thinking I wanna marry the shit out of this woman. On one of our first dates we bypassed a jewelery shop she told me she liked.  
I had remembered it and went there with a sketch of a ring I wanted specifically crafted for her. I bought her a dress, chocolates and left her a note for place and time of our date. I'm barely holding myself together that night. We go to the first bench in the park where we drank coffee on our first date and I propose right there and then. Three months into the relationship.  
It felt like the universe had conspired and cast it's magic on me.  
Same september week she moved from her parents to live with me. Then came the family and friend gatherings, little trips here and there... We were content, happy, blissful.  
After that we moved to her grandparents old apartment in a respectable neighbourhood, rent free, had more financial freedom.  
By the start of 2024 two of my best friends and colleagues had a fallout with adiministration and left the city. I had no one to talk to. It was shit but she told me to see it as an opportunity to step up and fill the shose of my seniors, so I did. It was extremely tiring and the responsibilities at times were beginning to weigh on me but I was growing to become reliable and good surgeon.  
We planned our wedding, picked a venue, talked with all the necessary people, she made sure of that.  
We got a bigger family car on a lease. I insisted she be the one to drive it out of the car saloon.  
I was planning our future but always asked for her input. I wanted US to decide. Every trip, everything I bought I got it for us. Never asked her for anything, it was my job to provide for our family.  
I had always told her that I'd like us to save up and have an apartment under our name. Because my life experience taught me that even your family can throw you out on the streets. She argued that this was going to be hers one day anyway. And to some extent I agreed so we moved on.  
Then work was becoming unbearable. The healthcare environment is toxic, stressful, long operations.  I had no one to talk to, not a single soul. Felt abandoned by my friends. I was taking too much and worked extra to be on top. In an emotional moment from my side I shared that with her. And she said that whatever happens at work, stays there and at home we just enjoy our time together. So I tried my best. She hated one thing that I would often say - I'm tired. But I was, physically and emotionally drained but I still made time for her and whatever she wanted to do. Sometimes I'd tell her I don't want to go out. Have her girlriend come with her, let them spend some time together.  Sometimes I went 20 days without a day off.  She couldn't understand that I was chronically tired and had no time to recharge because there was always something we have to do or somewhere to go. Coming back home after work and finding out I'd lay down and sleep or watch TV would make her irritated. But I also cleaned, shopped groceries, washed clothes. She mostly cooked  - deliciously, and I always let her know how much I appreciate it.  We did share housekeeping.  
One day we bought two yorkies because ever since hers died a few years back she'd always wanted another one.  
Fast forward to the middle of October 2024 she went to shop for her wedding dress, she ordered it and showed it to her mom and mine. She was glowing. We had our little happy dance. I said I can't wait to see you that day. The only thing that remained was to make the guest list.

A week or two later we had to drive a car that I bought from her dad to my family because theirs went to scrap. Upon returning home, I couldn't park properly the first time ( I've had my drivers license for about a year, she's had hers for 10) and told her I was probably tired and couldn't see anymore. **After this day things started to go downhill.** She looked at me and said ""What are you even tired from"". I went sour and sulked for a couple of hours infront of the TV, didn't talk, didn't do shit. She went to bed. I was going to sleep on the couch but decided that I love her more than I care and want to sleep next to her. Next morning we sat, had our coffee and I told her that her reaction hurt me. Her response was that I don't get to be tired, there are always things to do. So I suck it up and apologise and life goes on. I started seeing change in her that I couldn't put my finger on.  
One day at the end of November I asked her how would she like to spend New year's eve. With friends ? Or maybe we plan a trip abroad? I didn't see the spark anymore in her responses. She was preparing for a nightshift, she was distant. I asked her - Are you happy? She said now is not the time. But there was never enought time, for us to sit and discuss our needs and desires. She expressed doubts about our relationship. So I went and talked with her parents, expressed that she's having doubts, but I'd do anything to remedy our relationship. Maybe it was the routine of our daily lives that was slowly killing us. They said - no worries, you just need to figure out how to communicate. So same night, I went to work, pulled her aside and told her that she's the love of my life, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for us. She smiled, I kissed her, she kissed me and I left her to work.  
As a man who loves a woman I wanted to do everything so she can be happy.  So a few days later I asked her what's missing for you in this relationship, what can we do to remedy the situation so that you're feeling fulfilled. And she said she just doesn't see a future for us.  
I was devastated. We took a loooong drive and I tried to talk with her, what's going on. The only thing she showed was hopelessness, no motivation. I was desperate to save our relationship. We each had conversations with her parents, and there was a glimmer of hope.  
From what I understood is that she wanted me to show that she can depend on me for everything.

But I was already doing everything. Finances, Trips, Groceries, Bought expensive gifts, Little gifts, Housekeeping, Emotional availability.  
I just wanted us to talk, communicate, remedy. I was there with everything I had.  
At a work christmas party, a friend  showed me a video of a coworker trying to make a move on her. I confronted her about it and asked her if there was another man. She denied it.  
My misery went for 30 days. I did everything in the house, I took her out to dinners, movies, trips.  I begged her to talk to me, about what's going on and what can we do. Told her the grass isn't greener on the other side but where you water it.  She was irritated all the time. We didn't have intimacy even though I desperately wanted to. It had been a while.  
On first of January 2025 after an atrocious new year's eve with our friends I tried to be intimate with her. Her reaction blew me to dust.  
So I asked her, we're not talking, we're not fucking, we're not doing anything. Can we really talk please ?  
Just to underline again. This is after a whole month of me being a fucking man, holding my own emotions even though I was dying inside, doing anything and everything a family of two should do together.  
She said she doesn't see a future for us....  I asked her if she loves me. She said yes. But love wasn't enough. She had energy in the beginning. But now, there was no energy left of her to give to our relationship.  
If grief and desperation had a child together I would be born.  
I asked her to take off the ring I specifically had made for her if she's serious about this, I'm done playing. And she took it off.  I couldn't take it back. (There's a saying for easy going people in my native language that translates: If I was a woman, I wouldn't get out of the obstetrics ward). 

I told her that I'd leave it with her if she ever changes her mind.  
I went to say goodbye to her parents.  
I went to find a place to rent, went and cried like a child in my father's arms and mourned what could've been.  
Having accepted this hard reality. The next day I decided to let her know that despite of mine and her feelings, she can always depend on me for everything. Let's put it on pause, we don't have to promise each other anything. We hugged and kissed and she left for work.  
I'd go out and find shit to do so I can give her space at home before I move out, she'd go out with her friends and we'd meet each night. Watch something and go to sleep in the same bed. I told her: do not mistake that I do not question where you go or what you do for lack of care for you. And she said: I know.  
I was dying, I loved this woman, I'd watch her sleep and pray that she'll change her mind. Sadly my prayers weren't answered.

Last two days before I could move out I asked her: Do you really want me to move out? And she said, are you really asking me now? Why didn't you ask earlier?  
I was baffled.  
Her phone rings, she closes it. Which she never does.  
For the past month she had been extremely cautious and secretive.  
Next thing, with regret I decide to check her watch which she left in the bathroom.  
Calls and texts from the coworker I asked her about a month prior.

If anyone knows what vivisection is, describing it in detail is an understatement. My trust, my hope, my grace was chewed, spit and shat on.

I was bawling, inconsolable. She barged and asked me what's wrong.  
I told her I found out in the most ugly possible way.  
She said she'd seen him once, and that they texted after she gave me thing ring back. She didn't do anything to be ashamed of. He wasn't the reason of us splitting.  
I told her I'd forgive her, but be with me. Take the damn ring, I prefer you, our family over anything.  
She said she didn't know.  It is what it is. So I took my ring and left.

People who are confused and depressed and don't know where they stand don't just go on dates with other people. They sit their ass and talk about it with friends, parents, partner....

The face she showed me that night was not that of someone who cared for me, who loved me for almost two years. Someone who was ready for marriage.

Was I simply being used and manipulated by a narcissist? I've never been more commited to anything in my life. I wanted family, stability, kids, someone to provide for and love. I'm so confused in my own thoughts about what happened. We had a bright future in front of us....

TL:DR  
My fiance left me.  
I don't know what happened.  
She didn't want to talk, said we've talked many times before. But there's never been a talk or some kind of serious implication/argument.  
Did she betray me/was there nothing from the start and was I simply being used for financial gain, support?",3,1738353385.0,relationships,1,0.8,False

Long story short, I am 33F suffering with BB since 17. Like most of you, I tried everything and nothing worked. But I feel like I may be into something that, if successful, can be life changing for all of us 🌞 

Years ago, I came across a book called ""Eat Right 4 Your Type"" by Dr Peter J. D'Adamo.

It explores the idea that different blood types (A, B, AB, and O) have unique dietary needs for optimal health. The book suggests that certain foods are beneficial or harmful based on one's blood type 🩸

I am O+, so basically my diet should be mostly carnivore, which it was until I became 16 to 17 years old. After that I started liking vegetables and drinking coffee and tea with milk. 🫠

Ever since I've had BB, I would describe it as literally smelling like shit, as one of my bosses told me ""there's shit coming out of your mouth, do you know that""? 2x (She said it twice) 💩

Yesterday, after so many years or pain, suffering, bullying, isolation and depression I made the connection. It's only been a day but since yesterday, I have stopped drinking milk and eating vegetables. I had stake for dinner and peppermint tea in the morning. Then I went to uni and haven't had any reactions the entire day. I know it's soon but I feel like milk and veggies have been the cause of my BB for all these years 🤦🏼‍♀️😭

🔸️What I want to try is a collective experiment. To get involved you will have to do the following:

➡️ 1. Know your blood type, and post it in the comments. 

➡️ 2. Go to chatgtp, type your blood type and the name of the book. Ask to give you a list of food you should, and shouldn't eat. (Don't need to buy the book AI will tell you).

➡️ 3. Make sure you follow this diet for 7 days at least, 2 weeks would be better.

➡️ 4. Come back to this post and under your blood type comment, tell us if your BB is still there, it it's gone, or reduced. (After a few days, then after a week, and after 2 weeks if possible).

Please guys let's try this 🙏 We don't have anything to lose. Most of us have already lost a lot, specially our dignity, mental health and self confidence. 

If it doesn't work well move on into a different strategy, but I personally think this may be it and I am very excited because if it works, I will be a normal person and so will all of you 💜

1ienknt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ienknt/me25m_and_my_long_term_best_friendnow_coworker24f/,Me(25M) and my long term best friend/now coworker(24F) started dating and just broke up.,"For context I have been friends with (will call her coworker cuz that’s what I changed her contact to lmao) my coworker since we were 20 years old and met in college, while In college there was nothing romantic between us we were strictly platonic. Even to points where we would help eachother get laid and or pursue each others friend. There were flashes of attraction between us ie minimal flirting as there is in young friendships and 3-4 times total where we’d drunkenly fall asleep in the same bed/couch. No form of sexual or romantically charged things had ever happened. We graduated and remained good friends while working together at a restaurant in our college town, with her long term boyfriend at the time who I became very good friends with. Then eventually she moved to the city and we kept in touch but not as close as previously but still interacted online as part of the same friend group. Flash forward to June 2024 I moved to the same city as her and become coworkers at the same company working down the hall from each other. Then immediately went back to the good ol days with chit chat and messing with each other at work, going out with our friends on the weekends to bars and party’s and whatever we planned. But something had changed, you know that feeling you get that something is different but you can’t put your finger on it. It felt like that. All of sudden as the months went on at work I couldn’t not talk to her and hearing about her dating life of who she got dinner with on the weekends or who she had hooked up with last saturday had a new taste to it, I didn’t exactly care like I knew I was in love but it just didn’t sit right so I would walk away. I started to realize how great she looked some days and thinking about it afterwards long after I had clocked out for the day. Then on her end (as I’ve found out later she felt the same) she had become very interested with who I was seeing, questions on what dates I was going on if I was seeing anyone seriously or who I was booking up with. Then something really began to change, fun flirting became a little more direct that I wouldn’t repeat to HR and grabbing coffee at lunch turned to us two getting lunch and random gifts dropped off at each others desks. 

Then that night came around in October, there was a networking event after work with a few drinks and a cocktail hour, that her and I attend with a few others and it was a simple fun time and when it ended we texted a few friends in the city that were out to meet up at a bar. The night continues on bar to bar and drinks are piling up, for some reason The Coworker and I can’t stop laughing and talking to each other, our friends and coworkers start filing out up until it’s me and her left with her best friend with us at the last bar around 12 Am. At this point I’m hammered and start my Irish exit attempt to get ZYN at the 7/11 and head home as I usually would. Then I get a call from THE Coworker asking where I went and if I was still at the bar sounding pretty hammered so I think ah shit gotta save this idiot again. I run back and sure enough her and her friend are talking to some dudes and I run up and just chat with them for a bit. The Coworkers friend seems adamant on heading home with one of the guys so I offer for The Coworker to crash on my couch as my place is closer. Which had happened countless times at this point of our life in the city and nothing has ever happened. We get back and start shooting the shit with my roommate who also knows this isn’t out of the ordinary I grab us some waters to start resetting for work the next day and as my roomate heads to bed I get up to go the kitchen I gave her a quick kiss on the cheek to be like hey dude you’re cool. She then gave me a look I will not forget forever and I immediately think fuck it and go in for the big kiss, we stop and she looks at me and says “I want you” this is followed by a 30 minute make out session more passionate I have never experienced in my life (which I look back now and feel embarrassed). Then as we transitioned to my room we stop mid kissing before anything progresses and we both just say “holy shit”. Can’t say I remember much after but we went to sleep but in the morning had the funniest laugh and the most awkward uber ride of my life of both of us trying not to laugh. Immediately the world feels like it’s changed over nice, words spreading through the friend groups like wild fire as we each try to calm everyone down. I honestly didn’t even plan to act on it in anyway I thought things would go back to normal but now there was this sense of something in the air she was happy and giggly every day in the office and I couldn’t wait to get to work everyday. But I just thought drunk make out sessions happen, I mean you hear shit like this all the time two friends just had a few too many drinks one night and a kiss happens. But I guess she had other plans as a few days later she asks me to get drinks to talk this out and I agree. It’s awkward at the restaurant we can barely get any words out and we just kind of word vomit on eachother like oh shit happens hahaha that was nice though. Then we walk away simple as that. Then after another Day or two my friends will not stop pestering me like “we knew this was gonna happen this is your moment go for it” I just kept denying it saying no no no it’s a fling it’ll pass. But then one night she sends me that song “sailor song by Gigi Perez” saying it reminded me of her. Then it all made sense that this could be something more so I ask her to get dinner. I bring her to this nice Italian restaurant after work and have a glass or two to get ready and then I let it all go I say I want to try this with you I think I might be in love with you and she excitedly agrees and we talk all night. The highlights being her focusing on we have to be partners in this we have to fight for this if we really want it and I agree I want her and I want to do this we kiss as we leave…only to meet up with our friends out later at the club and they all bare witness to us making out on the dance floor so I guess cats out of the bag. 

The next few months are filled with nothing but happy moments of us going out together, staying the night after work, talking about our future and even starting to look at apartments together, even talking about marriage and babies and talk about what our family’s are going to think. In my head in all this I am happy I feel like it’s too good to be true I start to excel at work I stop drinking as much and I try to focus on her. Then after the time goes by it starts to falter a bit she seems to get stressed out by me and I start to shut down and ignore her out of nowhere something I haven’t done since my horrible ex and I used to fight (went to therapy for that, they agreed she was awful and damaged me..cheating and abusive sucks amirite oop) things took a bad a turn and neither of us knew how to handle it, we skipped a lot of very important talks such as ex relationships, what we want, and how we communicate  and I guess we just assumed this was happily ever after right in front of us and so we both questioned why it wasn’t working like we thought it would. Around mid December she had a girls trip so I took her on a very big date again to an Italian place where I had one of the workers sing for her this old romantic opera song I knew and she was having an amazing time. It was followed by a great talk at the end of the night and excitement for how we’re gonna work on this when she gets back. We had work and we had fun and when she had to leave she left me a note saying how much she’ll miss me and can’t wait to see me again and I say goodbye. 

Then something activated In me on the first night she went out to the bar literally that same night she had barely been there for more than an hour and I was angry with her. I immediately feel attacked and angry that she went on the trip and to this day I don’t know why I acted that way, I was accusatory and then I ignored her for the whole trip like a crazy person. I guess my past wasn’t so healed after all, she gets back the next Monday we have a very very large fight unlike one we’ve ever had and then we go on and acts like everything is fine I keep trying to make it up to her and we talk somewhat. Then that Thursday I get a very long breakup text describing the issues wrong with me basically saying that she can’t be with me until I am healed and that she can’t be with someone who acts so immature and insecure, and although she loves me she can’t be with me right now. Followed by a few more rounds of texts explaining that I need to heal and that it’s not that she’s lost interest or That she doesn’t see a Version of us in the future but that she really can’t help me I have to help myself. I don’t take this news well and begin to argue and blame her for my own issues. The next few days are friendly some talking and apologizing on both sides and I basically tell her I get what you meant and I will wait for you and then she gets upset saying “ that’s not the point of what I told you “ and I try to talk it out with her but she’s not having it. The next week is more of the same pretending we’re friends and everything’s okay and then I decide the next best move is to just have it out tell her that I love her and want to be with her. So on Xmas eve after work I walk her to her car and tell her everything from “I know you said I need to work on myself but I’m in love with you I can’t pretend that I’m not and I know I messed up can we please just start over” with a few more emotional things in there for effect and then I kiss her. She seems like she reacts to it well and for the next few days we talk again like everything’s fine and then about a week later she goes cold and I freak out. I try to get to her to talk to me but I’m shut out and there are no attempts to find a resolution. So I panic and start bombing her phone trying to get her to talk to me and I try to explain everything but she just cuts me short saying she doesn’t feel the same. I say okay and then nothing from then until now, I’ve done a lot of reflecting since then and still have questions but for the most part I know I should’ve walked away. I am completely shut out from her life and there’s a chat or two a week between us at the office but it’s nowhere close to what it used to be. Basically meaning we’re in no contact everywhere but work any attempt I make to talk outside of work goes no where and she tells me she’s busy. 

Sorry it’s such a long story but I genuinely feel like I’ve lost my mind haha all I do is stay up late writing how I feel down in a journal and writing up texts to send her. I can’t really sleep or eat. I also stopped drinking to get clarity, but that lead to getting a tattoo which is crazy itself cuz I have never even thought about it before. None of my friends are any help as the people who told me to go for the love of my life are now telling me it was just a fling and I feel like the biggest idiot in the world. I could use some advice concerning next steps or practices I could take to calm down and stop trying to fix things? I could also use some perspective on the situation from anybody right about now so if you have any please leave some wisdoms. I came to Reddit hahah.

Why was I chosen? No idea. Maybe the coffee gods decided to punish me. Maybe they wanted to see how long I could endure a conversation where every sentence began with ""Actually, I’m a genius.""

The moment they arrived, I knew I was in trouble. Elon sauntered in wearing a cyberpunk jacket that looked like it was rejected from a Blade Runner costume test. Trump, meanwhile, was sporting his usual tangerine glow and a suit so boxy it could double as public housing.

""Biggest espresso guy, believe me. People always say, 'Sir, you make the best coffee,'"" Trump said as he sat down, uninvited, at my counter.

Elon nodded in approval. ""I once developed a coffee extraction method using neural interfaces and blockchain. Unfortunately, the beans kept becoming self-aware and unionizing.""

I did my best to tune them out as I pulled their shots. First up, a beautifully balanced Colombian single origin, roasted to perfection. I set the cups before them and waited.

Trump took a sip, smacked his lips, and made that face he does when someone tries to explain climate science to him. ""This tastes like a loser’s drink. Where’s the pumpkin spice?""

Elon swirled his espresso like it was a 2010 Bordeaux and muttered, ""This lacks innovation. Where’s the AI? This could be a Dogecoin-backed microdose of caffeine.""

I sighed. ""It’s just coffee.""

""JUST coffee?"" Elon gasped. ""Nothing is 'just' anything. This is why Tesla stock is undervalued. People think too small.""

Trump pointed a stubby finger at me. ""Sad! And why is it Colombian? Colombia, bad! They send the beans, the worst beans, some are good, I assume, but many are weak, not like good American beans.""

""America doesn’t grow coffee,"" I replied, already regretting my life choices.

""Not yet, but I could fix that. Huge plans. Best beans, tremendous beans,"" Trump assured me. ""We’ll call it MAGA Roast.""

Elon scoffed. ""MAGA Roast? That’s primitive. We should genetically engineer a bean that grows directly into espresso shots.""

""Ah, right. The cryptofascist approach to agriculture,"" I muttered.

""That’s slander!"" Elon declared. ""I’m not a cryptofascist. I believe in free speech—unless someone says something mean about me. Then I ban them from my social media empire.""

Trump nodded vigorously. ""Free speech is great! Except when people say things I don’t like. Then we need to investigate them for treason.""

The conversation somehow spiraled further out of control. We covered everything: space colonization (""Mars will be great, you’ll love it, totally not just a way to escape accountability""), the military-industrial complex (""Can’t have industry without military!""), and even espresso machine tariffs (""Why aren’t we making these in Ohio? Sad!"").

Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore. ""Look, do you guys actually like the coffee or not?""

Trump shrugged. ""I like mine with twelve sugars and a Diet Coke chaser.""

Elon furrowed his brow. ""If it’s not integrated with my neural implant, it’s mid.""

I sighed and poured myself a double shot, because I was going to need it.

As they left, still debating whether reality itself was overvalued, I realized one thing: no matter how perfect your espresso is, some people just have garbage palates.

I also realized I needed better friends.",6,1738352998.0,espressocirclejerk,3,0.88,False

I live in a rural area and my state's city capital is about 1 1/2 hrs away so starting up my own bakery is not an option. I've been seeing online home bakeries where they mainly ship their baked goods around the country. I've been thinking if setting up an aestheticly pleasing website to order mainly quirky niche baked goods, starting socials kind of vlog style and making my baking page almost an influencer thing, selling wholesale to coffee shops, farmers market stores like i work at, etc and actually town farmers markets and fairs. Other ideas have popped up like maybe a cake decor class once or twice a month. Ofc I have other side hustle ideas too like paintings and dog breeding but baking is my main passion.

(My mom and I are trying to start a small family business for doing services like that) So I asked, how much does he want me to do it for? For details it was going to be from Friday Night to Sunday morning. 

My mom voiced some concerns about it being overnight at his house, because he has a roommate that has a track record for being creepy. Me personally, I have never had a bad experience with this roommate(M24). But my mom wanted me to make sure that his bedroom door locked cuz her main concern was him watching me while I sleep (that has apparently been an issue when my uncle brought his female friends over). I didn't see it as a big issue cuz if he ever did that I'd tell my uncle, mom, or dad and his body would never be found so... Lol. 

Wednesday I confirm with my uncle a whole bunch of stuff, his doors lock, all I have to do is take care of the dog, feed him twice a day and walk him. My uncle told me to look at it like a vacation away from the busy house, he has a huge room all to himself, brand new Xbox, and I was just happy to get out of the house. He said I could also bring a friend. On the other hand, that would be my whole weekend at someone else's house. So I told him my rate for pet sitting is $30 a day and that includes feeding and water twice and a 10 minute walk. That is my normal charge and not for overnight. I looked up a normal over night charge and they range from 50-100 dollars A DAY. I told my uncle Friday night and Sunday morning I would count as one day. Two Days for a total of $60. I think that's a dang good deal. But I also know my uncle struggles with money, and he's family, so I told him he could pay me what he wants/can. He said he'd look into his budget and then get back to me. 

Wednesday night comes, after I get done at the gym I see he texted me about 15 minutes ago saying ""You can still come over and hang out if you want, but (roommate's) mom would to it for a pack of cigarettes"" now I'm frustrated. I had already made plans with my friend and already sent the text to her strict mom asking permission. Now out of the blue he canceled. I can't ask someone to do something with me then cancel the same day. But my uncle calls me and says ""I'm sorry, but I just don't have it in my budget. Valentine's Day is coming up and so is (baby cousin)'s birthday"". I understand, I'm going through the same struggles and I love baby cousin so it's okay. I told him I could still do the job (I don't think roommate's mom would walk the dog or show it any attention and that's not fair to the dog) and you could pay me next month after all that is over. He paused for a second contemplating, then gave me a very specific day to mark in my calendar saying he owes me money. 

Once I get off the phone my dad starts getting upset (he was already upset finding out uncle cancelled, but now he was furious) telling me I'm going to do a job then going to wait a whole month to get paid. Calling me a sucker and uncle is never going to pay me cuz he's flaked about money before and I don't know what I'm worth. Saying if someone else in the house is willing to do it for a pack of cigarettes then he's never going to pay me. He asked what are you going to do if next month rolls around and he says he can't pay you. I say I'll never do a job for him again. My uncle and I have a very good relationship, he's like a brother to me cuz the age gap between him and my mother are so far we basically grew up together like siblings. He's always trusted me to watch his kids for him while he's away and I've done it for him on multiple occasions. I can't recall a time he hasn't paid me. But that's not saying much cuz I have a short memory, that's why him telling me to mark my calendar gives me full confidence he'll pay me back. 

The whole family agrees he's not going to pay me. He made all these plans with me then when he found out my price he wants to cancel. They all said he was expecting to pay me $20. I would be willing to settle for 20 and do him a favor But I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt, because he's never done that to me before. He says he'll pay me the full $60, and I'm going to be waiting. I'll give you guys the update on if he pays me or not and if the job goes well or not.

1iene8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iene8k/help_me_get_out/,Help me get out,"I am so proud of myself. I finally made it and stepped out of my apartment again. Of course, I am still not showered and smelled like shit with some deodorant and hair perfume on top, but I am out in the fresh air and I immediately feel better. My thoughts circle, but it feels like they do so in a distance in my head. The sun is not shining yet, but really it is a blue sky and the sun is only rising now. Fresh early morning. Maybe for me, a new beginning.

The last weeks have been really difficult. The damn anniversary of January 4th. I could not take the comments I read online, but I read them all. At least that is what it feels like to me. If people are hostages or rightfully prisoners, how a day like that should be remembered? And I also make sure to not forget other things that happen. The attack in New Orleans, the attack on that German Christmas market, even though that was a while ago. Trump, Austria, Germany, Canada. I still have the key in my hand, and I reach for my phone, perhaps I should just check if there is anything new. I haven’t read an update about the fires in California for a while. My finger quickly unlocks my phone and I scroll through my apps for one moment, trying to find my NYT app. I freeze. Breathe. I need to stop this. Okay. Maybe the fires are not so important right now, at least not to me. I need to get some food. I need to get my head clear a little. 

People tell me they are worried about me. Honestly, I am worried about them. How can you not care this much?  How can you read all these things and just go on with your day? This is why issues keep on piling up, nothing gets solved because people fucking just go on to the next one. I see the same for me, because of the broken pipe I had to move my boxes out of the hallway, I had just moved in four months ago, and still have not unpacked everything. Fair enough, they were my winter clothes, and it is January, but I would say a warm one and really, I have better things to do. Now the boxes are in the shower. My landlord can not be reached, but I guess that he is still on Christmas vacation with his family. So that is fine. 

Oh, damn, I am still standing here with the keys in my hand. I looked around for a moment and tried to remember what I wanted to do. Go out. Get some food. Damn, I am even out of coffee now and that is awful. I feel ashamed that this is what gets me out of the house, not that I haven't had a meal that wasn’t cereal in 2 days. So be it. I should write a list, shouldn’t I? It is stupid to go shopping without a list, especially if you are hungry. And broke on top of that. I push the key into the lock and go inside again. Only after a few minutes of standing outside in the cold, do I feel how damp and warm it is here in comparison. I checked the thermometer that the previous renter left here and it says 62°. Yes, I definitely should take care of the heating issue I have. Landlord. I grab my phone and there is an update on the newsfeed about the fires. 

I look at the top right of my screen and notice that 15 minutes have passed, with me standing in the hallway, scrolling. My thumb hurts, it hurts all the fucking time. And since I got outside, I noticed this smell in here. Like something is rotten. The list. The shopping list. Shit, I really should get going and go to the market, it is still morning and I can get some fresh stuff if I am lucky. 

I step outside again, and I close the door after me. In a moment of panic, I look for my keys, find them, and then run away from the door for a few steps, just to slow down and hope that the neighbors did not see that. I take another look at my phone and decide to check if I can find anything about Kongo. It has been going on for ages there, hasn’t it? I stand there and scroll, and then remember I should get the hell going. What am I doing? The world is going to shit. It is. In front of the house, two pine trees used to feel green and fresh and like a welcome diversion from the gray of the city. Now in the gray air, some clouds have come up in the meantime and the sun is still not completely there, they just look dead to me. Still green, but sparser than usual. At the same time, they are big, and I wonder if a storm could make them fall on the little building that my apartment is in. What would happen if there was a wildfire here? I can’t imagine what these people must be going through. 

My apartment is on the back of a building and I need to go down the metal staircase to get to the front and make my way to the market. The staircase is icy and slippery, and I need to hold on to the rail tightly, it is so cold. After a few steps, I stop and check if I made a shopping list on my phone. That would save me at the market. Angrily, I put my phone back into my pocket, almost slipping as I take the next step and continue my way down the stairs. As I am on the last steps, I stop. I see a dead rat lying there, with what seems like a footprint on top. The black fur is sticking out of frozen crimson sludge, stuck in the profile of a boot. Did someone stomp that rat to death? It looked like insects were crawling there, some ants, in January there were no flies here. I did not smell anything over the cold, crisp morning air. Some rat blood was frozen on the sidewalk. The cadaver was lying right in front of the last step, and I would have to walk over it. I stand there for a minute. This is too much for me. Fuck. I turn, and I make my way up the stairs. Fuck.

At the beginning of our relationship, we went out a decent amount. We loved to try new restaurants, coffee shops, etc. but the past few months its felt like pulling teeth trying to get him to do anything with me.

We only go out when he wants, where he wants, and who he wants to go with. l've sent him so many cool new restaurants, food stands, and coffee shops for us to try, and he just ignores them.

Tonight we were supposed to go out to meet his new co worker and his wife. They canceled this morning, so i asked if my boyfriend still wanted to do something. He said ""if something means nothing then yeah"" but i'm sick of just sitting in his room every night. I asked him when we can try one of the new places that opened up downtown, and he said if i wanted to drive he might be down… he just shows no genuine interest in doing anything with me anymore. 

Last weekend he told me he just wanted to stay in, which was fine, but then he ended up meeting his friends at the bar saturday night… after he told me he didn’t want to do anything with me. 

Any time i try to bring up a small issue in our relationship he gets defensive and it turns into an argument when it doesn't have to, so i’ve been hesitant to talk about this. 

I don't know what to do or what to say. Are we just out of the honeymoon phase and i should wait it out? Is it worth leaving if i’m bored and lonely? 
How do i address this without him getting mad?

I'd want to take you on real walks, not just describe them-go on that movie date where I can actually see your expressions change at every plot twist, hear your laughter, and maybe sneak in a knowing smirk when the rom-com gets all cheesy. I'd want to go on that hike we talked about, watching you take in the view, making sure you don't trip over a rock while I pretend not to be impressed when you handle the climb like a pro. And beyond all that? I'd want to be part of the life you dream of. That cozy house with the cats? I'd want to be there, making you coffee on slow mornings, lying next to you on lazy afternoons, watching the rain while wrapped up in the kind of quiet that doesn't need words.

1ien4f4,https://i.redd.it/v4juzjgtsdge1.jpeg,"Lost, Sad, Worried","Hey guys! 

Could really appreciate some advice! 

This is my first time living in a flat share in london - (not student accommodation) but flat share. I m sharing the flat with two other girls. 

After viewing many many houses- I found this beautiful house with three rooms with mine being an en-suite. 

Now, in January- we’ve had a huge dispute because of scabies and other issues. We had a confrontation last week. My one flatmate got scabies in the house and gave it to the others - which massively pissed me off. All of this had ofc led to a lot of acrimony. 

The other girl said some very hurtful things to me - such as I prefer the house without you in it, you only think of yourself etc. 

Mind you this is when they both went in my room in my abscence

In general this has all been a lot for me and cause a lot of stress and anxiety- the scabies, the remarks etc. 

Since then I have resolved things with the scabies girls and the other girl I have asserted my boundaries and said she cannot speak to me like this. If she has a problem- she can leave. 

I think a main issue for me is- I don’t have the same commitment to cleaning that the scabies girls does- who made this rota (attached below)- I m extremely busy with work and frankly am not tht anal about cleaning to the extent it is spotless. 

My flatmate requires the kitchen to be SPOTLESS- usuing many tissues everytime even while making a cup of coffee and will herself sometimes forget to pick up after herself - leaving cutting boards/takeout etc. I’ve never been the type to take pictures and post but she has. 

Scabies girl and me have apologised and spoken. I have messaged the other girl but have received no response. 

My solution personally was that- I cannot offer so much of my time cleaning and hence wanted to suggest that I get a cleaning lady who can come once in two weeks and do this for me. I m okay to take the bins out once in 3 weeks as per rotation. 

Their other complaint was I spend too much time in my room and also not enough at the flat (I was travelling for 1-2) months and barely home. 

Now I m thinking to either find a replacement and move- anyway planning to move from south london to north to afford a better area - move early before the contract expires or to suck it up. It’s heartbreaking cause I had found this flat after a lot of struggle. 

I told the scabies girl- and admitted to the mistakes I have made and changes I can do and to be fair so did she.


But frankly, all this had made me v anxious living there and not feel safe and protected. Especially the remarks from the other girl. I now feel anxious sitting in the sofa or ever making coffee or - fucking up or forgetting something. It’s driving me insane. 

And disclaimer- completely agree I have never lived in a flatshare before- but I pay the rent and utilities on time, bring their parcels up or help when they have guests visiting, sometimes making tea or whatever. 

All this is said because before we were getting along fine. 

I have thought about living alone but would get incredibly lonely. I also find moving and finding another house A PAIN but for me not feeling anxious and safe in a house is paramount. I also am not sure I can put up with someone being so anal. 

Pls let me know what you think but pls be kind and gentle in the comments. These comments affect me and as I said I m open to constructive feedback. ",1,1738351941.0,badroommates,4,1.0,False

***Private Memory Transcript, Earth-Date***\*\*:\*\* 07-04-2141

**Jovi Rosee, Head of Production of Rosee Studios, Employee of MultiVer Solutions, Head Writer and Executive Director of “The Exterminators (2141)”**

*Five days, four hours until incident*

 

I stepped off the bus with a duffel bag slung over my shoulder and let the heat and humidity of Holcombville wash over me. The station was little more than a bench and a metal shelter overlooking a dusty parking lot. Despite the blazing July sun and a chorus of cicadas, the warmth that really mattered was the familiar feeling of coming home.

Up ahead, I spotted my mom—Linda Rosee—waiting by her old car, waving animatedly with both hands. She was wearing one of her signature embroidered polos, even though she’d long since sold her IT business to MultiVer. She might be retired and approaching seventy, but she still had the energy and hair of someone half her age.

“Hey, sweetheart!” she called as I approached.

“Hey, Mom.” I dropped my bag at my feet and let her pull me into a tight hug. She smelled like lavender lotion and the slightest hint of fresh-brewed coffee, just like she always did.

“How was the ride?”

“Not bad.” I shrugged. “Just long enough for me to question whether buses are the best way to get around.”

She laughed, guiding me to the car. “Well, we’re working on that, I hear. Spaceships and everything—although we’ll probably be too old to enjoy commercial flights back to Skalga.” Her eyes sparkled. “But your brother might have a say in that.”

I smiled, my mind already jumping ahead to Joseph. I hadn’t seen him in far too long—he’d been on Skalga for months, teaching high school band. I was looking forward to hearing about his adventures.

We drove through winding roads lined with trees of all different shapes and sizes until we reached the outskirts of Holcombville proper. Wooden houses, some a bit run-down, and tidy green lawns blended together, forming the patchwork of the small town I’d grown up in. Flags and bunting were already on display for the Fourth of July, adding a celebratory pop of red, white, and blue at every turn.

When we pulled up to the family home—a modest two-story with a screened-in porch—I spotted my dad out front, watering Mom’s beloved flower beds. Jim Rosee, Professor of Theology at Emory University, with a permanent gentle smile and well-worn eyes. He waved the hose in greeting, splashing water across the sidewalk.

“Jovi!” he boomed, setting down the hose and extending his arms. “Welcome back!”

I hopped out of the car and gave him a hug, trying to avoid the wet patches on his shirt where he’d accidentally drenched himself. “Good to see you, Dad.”

He patted me on the back. “We were starting to think you’d decided to stay in the big city for the holiday. Your mother’s been cooking up a storm, so you got here just in time.”

I followed them inside, greeted instantly by the smell of fresh cornbread and something sweet—brownies, probably—wafting from the kitchen. Sure enough, Joseph stood at the counter, fiddling with an old radio and occasionally glancing at the stove timer. He looked the same as always—rockstar hair, round glasses, that easy smile—except he seemed... calmer. More at peace.

He turned around as I dropped my bag near the living room couch. “Hey, Short Round!” he called, pulling me into a quick hug. “Long time no see.”

“Tell me about it,” I said, giving him a once-over. “You’ve got that off-world glow. How’s Skalga treating you?”

He laughed. “Different gravity, different diet, lots of furry students who have trouble with wind instruments. But I love it.”

“Well, I can’t wait to hear more,” I said, genuinely curious about his experiences. “You here for the whole summer or what?”

Joseph exchanged a look with my parents, then back at me. “Actually, I’m just visiting for two weeks.” He hesitated, rubbing the back of his neck. “I, uh… I decided to stay on Skalga. Permanently.”

I blinked. “Wait—like, *permanently* permanently?”

“Yeah,” he said, his voice gentle. “I love it there. The kids are amazing, and there’s a real need for teachers, especially in music. There’s this sense of rebuilding after everything that’s happened, you know? It feels… important. Jamelyn and Jasmine, they’re making a go of their salon, too. We’ve all kind of found our place.”

I tried not to let my shock show on my face, but Joseph clearly saw the surprise in my eyes.

“Sorry,” he added quickly. “I should’ve told you sooner. But with my classes and everything going on with the show—” He gestured vaguely, referring to my job. “I figured I'd wait until I could tell you in person.”

My mom cleared her throat. “Your sisters absolutely love it, too. They’ve got so many Venlil interested in what they call ‘human-style pampering.’ Seems like a world away, but they’re happy.”

My dad chimed in with a thoughtful nod. “They have a real community over there now. ‘Little Terminus,’ they call it. Strangest blend of cultures you’ll ever see—apparently, they even have a café that serves cappuccinos and Strayu.”

I opened my mouth, closed it, then tried again. “Wow. I mean—wow. I’m happy for you, really. Just… didn’t expect this.” A rush of emotions hit me: pride, sadness, curiosity. “I guess there’s not much left for you here, then?”

Joseph shook his head gently. “This will always be home. But sometimes life takes you to places you never imagined. And once you settle in… it’s hard to leave.”

For a moment, none of us spoke. The only sounds were the sizzling from the kitchen stove and the muffled hum of the radio. Then Mom set her hands on her hips, breaking the silence with a sunny smile.

“All right,” she said. “This is a *holiday*, and we’re together under one roof—even if it’s not for long. That calls for a celebration. Who wants to help me bring the grill onto the porch?”

Dad and Joseph leapt at the suggestion, leaving me to trail behind them. My mind was still buzzing with the news. My siblings were basically building new lives light-years away—and thriving at it, too. It made me wonder where I really belonged, especially with all the drama going on back in Atlanta.

By late afternoon, it was clear that Mom and Dad’s Fourth of July bash had evolved into something bigger than a simple family get-together. That was just how Linda and Jim Rosee did things—never in half measures. From the wraparound porch, I could see the yard teeming with people, practically the entire neighborhood. Neighbors from up and down the block mingled with old family friends and a few out-of-towners stopping by. At the edges of the gathering, a couple of curious onlookers— some human and some not—hovered in quiet fascination, uncertain whether they were fully invited or just drifting through.

As if reading my thoughts, my dad emerged onto the porch carrying two folding chairs under each arm. “The Murphys just showed up, and the Dyers are on their way,” he said, setting the chairs down. “We might need a little more seating.”

I offered a hand with the chairs, but he waved me off. “I’ve got it, Jovi. Go help your mother see to the food if you like.”

“Right,” I replied. “Speaking of which, I don’t smell any burgers or hotdogs.”

Dad chuckled. “Not this year. You know how folks get about the whole… meat thing. Better not to make anyone uncomfortable.”

“Five years since first contact, and we're still walking on eggshells,” I said. “Can’t say I’m complaining. Mom’s vegetarian cooking is legendary anyway.”

I headed back inside, weaving through guests chatting in the living room—some in red, white, and blue T-shirts, some sporting less traditional attire, all buzzing with that festive holiday energy. In the kitchen, Joseph was helping Mom fill trays and bowls, both of them talking animatedly about a new recipe for grilled veggie kabobs.

Mom must’ve spotted me in the reflection of the fridge because she turned and flashed a grin. “Jovi! Grab that tray of corn salad from the counter, will you? We’re almost ready to bring everything out.”

I did as she asked, balancing the brightly-colored bowl in my arms. “What’s on the menu, aside from the salad?”

She launched into a catalog of dishes: marinated tofu skewers, sweet potato fries, mushroom burgers, a massive platter of grilled peppers and zucchini, potato salad made with plant-based mayo, and at least three different types of cobblers for dessert. Even though I’d grown up with my mom’s enthusiasm for cooking, I couldn’t help but be impressed.

“Wow, Mom, you really pulled out all the stops.”

She winked, snatching a batch of cheesy cornbread muffins from the oven. “You know us. Go big or go home. Besides, we have a reputation to uphold, and we can’t very well traumatize our alien guests with a massive display of meat on the grill.”

“It’s all about hospitality,” Joseph chimed in, sliding the muffins onto a cooling rack. “I was telling some of my Venlil students about how humans love barbecues, and they kept asking, ‘But… doesn’t it smell like burning flesh?’ I didn’t know what to say.”

“Well, this year, they won’t have to smell it at all,” Mom said resolutely. “And you can tell them that.”

I followed my brother back out onto the porch, each of us juggling a precariously tall stack of serving trays. Outside, the yard had transformed into a tapestry of red, white, blue, and every other color under the sun. It was pure noise and motion—firecrackers popping in the distance, people chatting and laughing, kids running around with sparklers, and the mouthwatering aroma of grilled veggies filling the air instead of charcoal-smoked burgers.

We set the food down on an improvised buffet table (really just two folding tables pushed together and draped in a patriotic tablecloth). Mom came out behind us, a triumphant smile on her face. Dad joined a moment later, distributing cups and plates. A few of our alien neighbors drifted closer, curious about the spread. One Gojid in particular seemed anxious, but her quills relaxed a bit when she realized everything was plant-based.

“Dig in, everyone!” Mom announced with the gusto of a carnival barker. “Vegetarian barbecue, courtesy of the Rosee household!”

With that, a few cheers went up, and the crowd started moving toward the tables. I glanced around, soaking in the moment—my parents, beaming, their home alive with chatter and laughter; Joseph trying to explain the concept of sweet tea to a perplexed Venlil; distant fireworks lighting the early evening sky. For a moment, all the tensions from the city, the show, and the drama of the last few days faded into the background.

This was home. This was family. And meat or no meat, the Rosee Household's parties were still the stuff of local legend.

**\[Fast-Forwarding Transcript: Four Hours\]** 

The fireworks burst overhead in brilliant colors, painting the sky in dazzling reds, blues, and golds. The crowd let out appreciative cheers as another round of rockets shot up from the field, courtesy of Uncle Todd, a church friend and card-carrying pyrotechnic expert. I leaned against the porch railing, a cold glass of sweet tea in hand, watching the display with a familiar mix of nostalgia and quiet contentment.

~~Then, something changed.~~

The next firework went off ~~with a sharp, snapping crack that didn’t sound quite right. Too crisp. Too loud. Almost like…~~

*~~Gunfire.~~*

The next explosion followed, ~~another sharp pop~~, then another, ~~rattling through my skull like something~~ *~~real~~*~~. My chest tightened, heart hammering against my ribs. At least... it should have.~~

~~No one else reacted~~.

I looked around the yard, scanning faces. Mom and Dad sat on the porch swing, their fingers intertwined, watching the sky with soft smiles. Joseph stood a few feet away, laughing as he chatted with an old friend. The kids in the yard ran around with sparklers, completely at ease. ~~No one flinched. No one so much as glanced around in alarm.~~

~~I started to say something, but the words didn’t come out.~~

~~I tried again. Nothing.~~

~~I frowned, confused. At least I tried to, but I couldn't even do that.~~

~~My body wasn’t reacting. I couldn't even frown~~

I took another sip of tea. My shoulders relaxed.

~~Except… I~~ *~~didn’t~~* ~~do any of that.~~

*~~What the hell?~~*

~~Inside, I was still panicked, still waiting for the next sharp crack to come, for someone—~~*~~anyone~~*~~—to confirm that I wasn’t losing my mind. But outwardly?~~ My body carried on ~~as if~~ everything was perfectly fine.

Another firework went off. *Pop-pop-pop*\*~~.~~\* ~~It echoed too much, sounded too much like something it shouldn’t. My stomach twisted, but~~ my body stayed still.

I ~~wanted to turn, to ask Joseph if he was hearing this, to grab Mom’s arm and tell her something was~~ *~~wrong~~*~~, but I just...~~ sat there, sipping my drink, watching the sky, smiling slightly, ~~like I was~~ enjoying the ~~damn~~ fireworks.

~~I tried to move my arm. Nothing. I tried to step forward. Nothing. My body wasn’t mine.~~

~~Panic rose, but there was no place for it to go.~~ I was t~~rapped inside myself, watching as I played the part of~~ the normal, relaxed party guest. The world around me carried on, ~~oblivious, as if everything was~~ *~~fine~~*~~.~~

The polished wood door, bearing the Multin family crest, stood between me and the man who had molded so much of my life. One day, this office would be *mine*, but for now, it was still very much my father's domain. I closed the door behind me with a quiet click. High ceilings, walls lined with centuries-old volumes and framed achievements—the room was a study in power, prestige, and meticulous organization. Floor-to-ceiling windows behind the massive mahogany desk revealed a sweeping view of the Atlanta skyline. Dusk was settling in, and the city lights flickered on one by one, outlining skyscrapers in neon and gold. Dad stood behind the desk, hands clasped behind his back, gazing out at the Atlanta skyline like it held all the answers. The golden glow of the city lights reflected against the windows, casting long shadows across the bookshelves and the polished mahogany desk.

He didn’t turn around immediately, but I knew he heard me. “Jesse.”

“Dad.”

A pause. Dad turned, a faint smile crossing his features. “Son,” he greeted, motioning for me to come closer. He looked every inch the leader he was reputed to be—confident, self-assured—but the warmth in his eyes from seeing his son made him almost glow, as though the love he had for me shined like the sun.

I took a few more steps inside, slipping my hands into my pockets, trying to keep my posture easy, casual. But there was nothing casual about what I was here to say. “I wanted to see you. Talk about… well, about our plans for the future. With everything changing—Venlil Prime, the UN stepping in to manage extraterrestrial relations, all of it—I think it’s time for us to make a transition.” I swallowed, meeting my father’s eyes. “I’ve been thinking you should… step down.”

The words hung in the air between us, heavy but unavoidable. My Dad finally turned, studying me with that unreadable expression I’d seen a thousand times before. It was the same look he gave during high-stakes negotiations, when he was calculating, deciding.

“Step down,” he repeated, as if testing the words.

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “Look, our company is on the brink of a new era. We can’t afford to be viewed as the same old entity that all but sparked the Satellite Wars. That was under your watch, and—” I stopped my mouth, aware of how harsh I might sound. “—I mean no disrespect. You led us through tough times. But the public won’t see it that way. They just remember who was at the helm. If we want to thrive now that the UN is taking charge—especially with alien eyes on us—we need a fresh face at the top.”

Dad didn’t react right away. Instead, he moved to the desk, resting a hand on the chair—the chair I dreamed of sitting in someday. His fingers traced the edge of the leather armrest, thoughtful.

“You’re concerned about the company’s reputation,” he said softly, voice tinged with understanding. “And how we’ll be perceived by our new interstellar neighbors. You think it’s best if I remove myself from the spotlight entirely.”

Jesse gave a small nod. “I do. There’s a wave of public goodwill and curiosity now—thanks to the Venlil and the imminent Exchange Program. We can’t cling to the old guard or it’ll look like we’re stuck in a wartime mindset.” I paused, choosing my words carefully. “You always taught me that survival means adapting, Dad.”

Dad looked me in the eye, with the same look he gave me whenever he asked if I had trouble at school, as though he could read my mind and know what I wasn't telling him. “And you truly believe you’re ready to steer this ship?”

“As ready as I’ll ever be,” I replied, voice unexpectedly resolute. “I know it sounds blunt, maybe even disloyal. But I’m thinking about the future. Our future—and humanity’s.”

He studied me for a longer moment, then nodded slowly, as if accepting something inevitable. Then, after a pause, he asked, “Do you still remember my motto?”

It took me half a second to realize what he meant. But, of course, I knew. It was one of the first lessons he ever taught me.

“Humanity First,” I said.

Ignacio’s lips twitched in something like approval. “And what does that mean to you?”

I met his gaze without hesitation. “It means that before profit, before nation—before anything else—we have a duty to our fellow man. We have power, and with that power comes responsibility. It’s not just about ambition. It’s about using what we have to serve others.”

He studied me carefully, as if weighing my answer. “And now that humanity is no longer alone?”

The pause that followed was barely a second long, but it felt longer.

I shook my head. “The meaning hasn't changed, Dad. Not really. We still must put our duty to others before all else. It just that now some of the people we have a duty to aren’t human.”

For a moment, his expression hardened, and my stomach tightened. For a brief moment... I wondered if I should have lied. If i should have said we should put humanity over our new alien neighbors. If I should have declared humans would come before all others.

But then, just as quickly as the doubt crept in, his face softened. A warm smile broke across his features, and before I could react, he pulled me into a tight embrace.

“I’m proud of you, son,” he said, his voice thick with something I heard often—real, unguarded emotion. “Proud of the man you’ve become. And I love you.”

I didn’t hesitate. I hugged him back, holding onto the moment, onto the warmth of my father’s words. “I love you, too, Dad.”

Outside, the lights of the city flickered like stars, stretching far beyond the glass. A new era was beginning, and for the first time, I felt ready to meet it.

**Jovi Rosee, Head of Production of Rosee Studios, Employee of MultiVer Solutions, Head Writer and Executive Director of “The Exterminators (2141)”, Patient at Emory Hospital**

*Three days, five hours after incident*

 

The walls of the Executive Suite at MultiVer Plaza melted away, dissolving like mist in the morning sun. In their place was nothing—just an endless, empty white void. There was no ceiling, no floor, just a vast, featureless expanse stretching in all directions.

I didn't *feel* hurt, or injured… but I *remembered.*

I had been shot.

The sensation wasn’t there anymore—no pain, no burning in my chest—but the memory was vivid, as if it had happened only seconds ago. My last conscious thought before everything went dark came rushing back: the realization that if I didn't do something, someone was about to die.

And now, standing across from me, was Jesse Multin.

Not the younger Jesse I had just seen in his father’s office, making his case for a new era. This was the Jesse I knew from eight days ago. The Jesse from *now.*

His suit was crisp, his posture still carrying that effortless confidence, but there was something different about him. He was somber, almost… subdued. No grandiose gestures, no charming smirk, no practiced sales pitch. Just a man standing in the middle of the void, facing me with an expression that almost—*almost*—looked like regret.

""Hello, Jovi Rosee,"" Jesse said, his voice measured. ""I think I have some explaining to do.""

I stared at him, my mind scrambling to make sense of what was happening.

“Where am I?” I asked, my voice steady but firm.

Jesse exhaled, running a hand through his perfectly combed hair before looking back at me. “That,” he said, “is a *very* complicated answer.”

I crossed my arms. “Try me.”

Jesse studied me for a long moment, then nodded. “Alright. But before I do, tell me something—how much do you *remember?*”

I swallowed, flashes of memory resurfacing, but none of them made sense. The last thing I recalled before waking up here was… pain. Gunfire. Chaos. And now, I was standing in a place that shouldn’t exist, having a conversation that *shouldn’t* be happening.

I narrowed my eyes at him.

“All of it,” I said. “And none of it.”

Jesse gave a faint, knowing smile. “Yeah,” he said. “That sounds about right.”

1ien0ly,https://www.aigroup.com.au/resourcecentre/resource-centre-blogs/hr-blogs/from-burnout-to-balance-enhancing-employee-wellbeing-in-winter/,Building Strong Workplace Connections to Combat the Winter Slump,"**TL;DR:** Workplace connections are critical during the winter slump, helping to reduce isolation, boost morale, and improve productivity. Building these connections requires intentional effort, especially in hybrid or remote environments. Simple strategies like regular check-ins, virtual coffee chats, and fostering mentorship can create meaningful professional relationships that support mental health and resilience during challenging seasons.  

---  

The winter slump is real. Between post-holiday fatigue, shorter daylight hours, and seasonal challenges like SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), many professionals find Q1 to be the hardest time of the year to stay motivated and productive. But there’s good news: strong workplace connections can make a significant difference, not just for individual well-being but for overall team dynamics and organizational success.  

Here’s why connections matter—and what you can do to strengthen them.  

### **Why Workplace Connections Are Key in Winter**  
Research consistently shows that workplace relationships impact mental health, job satisfaction, and even productivity. Positive connections can:  
- Reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness.  
- Enhance resilience to stress and burnout.  
- Improve collaboration and innovation.  
- Boost overall morale, especially during low-energy periods like winter.  

The winter months often exacerbate feelings of disconnection, particularly in hybrid or remote work settings. That’s why building and maintaining strong professional relationships takes on added importance during this time.  

---  

### **Challenges to Workplace Connections in Winter**  
- **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):** SAD affects up to 20% of people in northern climates, with symptoms including low energy, difficulty concentrating, and a sense of withdrawal.  
- **Remote and Hybrid Work:** While flexible work arrangements have benefits, they also reduce opportunities for casual, organic interactions that often form the foundation of workplace relationships.  
- **Time and Energy Constraints:** Between Q1 deadlines and personal obligations, finding time to connect with colleagues can feel like another task on an already long to-do list.  

---  

### **How to Build Workplace Connections During the Winter Slump**  
Fostering strong workplace connections doesn’t require a complete overhaul of how we work. Small, intentional steps can lead to meaningful improvements in how we relate to colleagues, whether you’re a team member or a leader.  

**1. Schedule regular check-ins.**  
One-on-one or team-wide check-ins provide an opportunity to align on goals, share progress, and—importantly—connect on a personal level. Ask questions like:  
- “How’s everything going for you this week?”  
- “What’s one win, big or small, that you want to share?”  
This simple habit shows you care and creates space for open communication.  

**2. Host virtual coffee chats or informal meet-ups.**  
Remote teams can replicate the benefits of casual in-person interactions through structured but informal virtual meet-ups. These don’t have to take long—15 to 20 minutes is enough to catch up, share ideas, or simply chat.  

**3. Create mentorship opportunities.**  
Mentorship offers immense value for both mentors and mentees, helping to expand professional networks, provide guidance, and create meaningful connections. Leaders can establish formal or informal mentorship programs to foster these relationships.  

**4. Leverage technology.**  
Platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom aren’t just for meetings—they can be tools for connection. Use informal chat channels, virtual whiteboards for collaboration, or even fun challenges to bring your team together.  

**5. Encourage team-building activities.**  
Activities don’t have to be elaborate or time-consuming. Something as simple as a shared playlist, a virtual game, or celebrating small wins together can create a sense of belonging.  

---  

### **Leadership’s Role in Fostering Connections**  
Leaders play a pivotal role in shaping a culture of connection, especially during challenging times. Here are some practical leadership strategies:  
- **Model connection-building behavior.** Share updates about your own projects or challenges to encourage open communication.  
- **Lead with empathy.** Understand that your team may be navigating personal and professional challenges during the winter months.  
- **Create inclusive opportunities.** Make sure activities and events accommodate all team members, regardless of their location or schedule.  
- **Recognize and reward efforts.** Celebrate not just results, but the efforts your team makes to support each other.  

---  

### **Why It Matters**  
The time and effort you invest in building connections this winter won’t just help in the short term. Strong workplace relationships lead to higher engagement, improved retention, and greater organizational success. Plus, they help create an environment where employees feel valued and supported—not just during the winter slump but all year long.  

What strategies have worked for you when it comes to building workplace connections? Whether it’s something small that made a big impact or a larger initiative, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Let’s start a conversation in the comments!

I'm just starting to get into making espresso at home and I'm wondering what accessories I should get to pull better shots. I do have a pretty cheap machine (the [Mr. Coffee 4-Shot Steam Espresso Machine](https://www.mrcoffee.com/espresso-machines/mr.-coffee-4-shot-steam-espresso-machine-cappuccino-maker-and-latte-maker-with-glass-carafe/SAP_2191914.html), to be specific), mostly because I'm a college student, so I'm not expecting too much, but I'm noticing issues with crumbly pucks and watery shots

I watched the James Hoffmann video linked in the Wiki about puck prep and it was a tad intimidating. All I have right now is the accessories provided with the machine (a measuring spoon, basket + portafilter, and a measuring cup) and [a Hamilton Beach coffee grinder](https://hamiltonbeach.com/fresh-grind-coffee-grinder-80335g). I was planning on getting a tamper because I think that's my main issue, but are there accessories that you would consider imperative to pulling a good shot?

This second part may be a dumb question, but please bear with me. I measured the basket and found that it's roughly 2 in/50 mm. I'm a bit confused on what size tamper to get. Should I get one that's 49mm or 50 mm? 

I'm located in the US, specifically PA, and I'm really not looking for something super expensive. I make espresso once a day and I primarily use it for iced lattes. I also only make double-shots, so the filter is only half-full every time I use it. ",2,1738351503.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

The coffee was decent but I couldn't tell any difference between what I brew with my south indian filter. I tried boiling the water beforehand as I've read being suggested on this sub. The coffee started flowing pretty quickly but it was very watered down, not like with all the foam thing (foama?) I see in the videos. Then I tried with room temperature water and it took a longer time for the coffee to start flowing but it was still very watery. Is it because of this moka pot being on the lower end hence not good?

I filled the water only a little below the valve thing. I think that's where I might have gone wrong. I don't have those aeropress filter things you guys talk about (those round paper things). Is that necessary? What difference does it make? And grind I have right now is a French press grind (I know I'm all over the place please forgive me).

A man along with his friend proceed to say ""that comment was gay, you need to fire that answering chick, and n\*gger you need to wake up and smell the coffee."" They both stated their names (one being the owner of the business), and called from their work line; the caller ID even reflected as much. I left a review stating what happened under the company page, and made a video on tiktok. The business owner called a total of 3 more times between the 24-27th, I continued to let it go to voicemail because I refuse to talk to this person. In the 2nd voicemail he stated ""haha, got me man. Long time no see."" Today, a week later I receive a cease and desist demanding I remove the review and video since I called him racist. The lawyer states the call was made ""erroneously and accidentally"" as he claims they meant to call an old friend, which is a complete lie since he directly responded to my husbands facebook comment with displeasure. They plan to sue me for $5 million dollars if I don't remove the video and review. This seems not only ridiculous, but illegal. My review and video are accurate, he called me to and use racial and homophobic slurs. Should I ignore it, are these empty threats to scare and intimidate me? Should I get a lawyer?

In the letter the lawyer refers to my actions as ""woke virtue signaling,"" claim my statements are false and that I am damaging his character and defaming him. ""Your statements are not only false but are intended to damage the reputation of my client and his company. Under Texas law, your conduct is actionable under multiple legal theories, including defamation, business disparagement, tortious interference with business relations, Invasion of Privacy, and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. Further, I find it deeply disturbing that you, upon receipt of a clearly mistaken voicemail, chose to voice your ""displeasure"" with Mr. Swayze by seeking him out, stalking his company, and then slandering him online to your 979 followers on Instagram - rather than just blocking his number. Woke virtue signaling at the expense of my clients' reputation and business will not be tolerated. Please be assured that this law firm will pursue you with tenacious vigor if our demands are not met. The courts will find your actions to be disgusting and pathetic. I have advised my client to bring suit against you immediately; however, Mr. Swayze has instructed me to send out this one and only warning. If I am forced to bring suit against you, my law firm will sue you personally, conduct discovery, depose you, and try this case before a jury in (redacted) County, Texas. We will seek injunctive relief against you. We will seek damages in excess of $5,000,000 against you. I have no doubt we will prevail in our suit, and we will collect on my clients' damages. We will find every dollar which you have and take it from you until that judgment is satisfied. We will never rest until every penny is paid to my clients out of your pocket.",66,1738350841.0,legaladvice,25,0.84,False

Lao Xu Village is a natural but tastes like there may have been at least some anaerobic fermentation on it. Cherry liquor/dried cherries and chocolate coming through strong on both my Origami and April brewers, with more nuttiness coming through on the Origami. Still messing with this one.

Black Sheep is a double ferment and all the flavors associated with it come through. Getting heavy Maraschino cherries and tropical fruits with brownie batter on the finish. Really shines on the April brewer. Would highly recommend both of these 👍👍👍",2,1738350787.0,pourover,1,0.67,False

The warm glow of late afternoon bathed the homestead in golden light as the group finished their evening tasks. Their homework was done, they’d practised for the deathball game tomorrow, and they didn’t need to take on any jobs for quite a while, but they had all still decided to make themselves useful around their home while it was still daylight. 

Jack wiped sweat from his brow as he finished holding up a sheet of metal for the shuttle they had finally gotten around to begin fixing up, while Nika welded it to the frame. The old shirt he had worn for the dirty job was slung over his shoulder, and the heat of the late afternoon had left his chest damp with perspiration, drawing more than a few lingering gazes from the group scattered across the grounds.

“Are you going to help or just stare?” he called playfully, raising an eyebrow in Sephy’s direction from where the Skritta had been tinkering with some electricals.

“Hey, why not both?” Sephy shot back with a grin. “I can multitask, you know!”

*Yeah right!* Chiyo exclaimed from where she was floating in the air, feeding delicate wires through the inside of the metal shuttle frame, happy to seize upon the sudden distraction from the manual labour. *Not if the results of your latest maths homework is anything to go by!* 

“Why do I need to bother? Maths is pointless as fuck!” Sephy retorted. “Why the hell do I need to learn how to ‘find x and y’ or what the angle of a fucking triangle is when all I actually need to know is what’s needed to program code and how to do sums when getting paid, counting my ammo or bartering for cool shit?!”

“She has a point!” Nika grinned. “What kind of career needs you to know that kind of stuff apart from ‘Maths Teacher’?”

*Lots of things!* Chiyo rolled her eyes. 

“Come on! I passed the latest exam at least!” Sephy shrugged. 

*You could try doing better than just passing!* Chiyo nagged, though Jack could see the Ilithii try her best to hide her amused smile before trying to return to her task. *So, Nika, you said I just need to…melt the metal to connect these wires?*

“Yes, Chiyo, that’s literally what soldering is!” The Kizun snorted in amusement. “Come on! I know you take the Industrial Vocation class like the rest of us!

Chiyo hesitated for a moment longer before very unconfidently applying the soldering iron to the wires. A faint puff of smoke rose, and she wrinkled her nose. *This feels barbaric*, she communicated, though she continued to fix up the wires.

“Why…won’t…this…just go in!” Alora muttered through gritted teeth, rolling up the sleeves of her old sage-green blouse-which was fraying at the cuffs and patched at the elbows-as she knelt beside a section of the shuttle’s interior, trying and failing to screw a metal bracket into place, holding her drill awkwardly with both hands as it spun slightly out of control.

“That’s what he said!” Sephy immediately joked, to immediate laughter from the others. 

“How’s everything coming along?” Alora called with a sigh as she took a break from drilling, panting heavily from the effort. 

“I’m pretty sure the hull plating is coming along well enough.” Nika shrugged, before tapping a patch where the welds looked rough. “But we still need to reinforce this section here and make sure it’s sturdy enough. Last thing we want is for one of us to fall out of the bottom because a panel gets knocked loose…”

“I’m sure the welding isn’t as bad as that!” Sephy pointed out. “Hell even if it is, we rode this thing pretty well when it was just a skeleton with an engine!”

“No we didn’t!” Jack scoffed. “I still remember what we did to land this thing!”

*It was not a pleasant trip.* Chiyo agreed. *Besides, we have other things to add!*

“Yeah, sorry Sephy, there’s no way we’re half-assing this one, especially when it involves high flying!” Nika chucked as she finished off the current weld she was working on. “At least it won’t take too long to have it welded to multiple points, then we can test the durability out by having Jack whack it a couple of times.” 

“Always happy to make myself useful…” Jack muttered dryly as he let go of where he was holding the sheet of scrap metal, happy to see that it sort-of remained in place. 

He smiled, and let out a contented sigh. 

It had been several weeks since they had met with Sable Krynn, and life for him and his friends had been relatively uneventful since then. Nobody had tried to kill them, they didn’t need to do any jobs, and the worst they’d had to deal with were some pre-holiday exams. 

Every time he went to sleep, he hoped to wake up in his room back on Earth like this was some weird fever dream. However, waking up instead to the sound of Sephy playing video games like a maniac downstairs no longer felt so bad.

They’d all agreed to maintain a relatively low profile in the immediate aftermath of their latest job, partly to avoid any possible retaliation from Megacorportations and other factions for them working for Corvin Enterprises, but mostly for what went down at Cypherport. 

While many eyewitness accounts had spoken up in praise of the group for their actions in slaying both The Redeemer and several of the hated Order of the Infernal Harmony, and also in protecting civilian lives during the ambush, just as many of the online rumours floating around the local Matrix had accused them of being the ones behind the slaughter and the reason for Cypherport being burned to the ground.

Alora had told them not to worry about the misinformation spread online, either by the fog of war, online trolls, or their enemies looking to throw shit their way.

It didn’t help that the scene of the crime had since been claimed by House Mal’Kar.

Those motherfuckers.  

On top of that, the bounty for The Redeemer was officially contested. While Nika had done her due diligence and provided bodycam evidence to the Church of Siros that Jack was the one to score the kill, other claimants had apparently taken advantage of the chaos, and claimed to have killed The Redeemer themselves. 

Though they didn’t know if Commander Cocaine was one of these claimants, one of the most popular online rumours was that he had killed the Redeemer in a drug-fueled rampage and completely forgotten about it in the aftermath (something that had apparently happened before), and local betting pools had marked him as the likely killer.

Had Jack not been the one to pull the trigger, he easily could have imagined it from what he’d seen of the guy on TV…

As ridiculous as these claims were, the resulting investigations from the various parties that put out the hit and the hunters’ guilds running the bounty listings would take some time to resolve.

Not that it mattered to them in light of the payday from their last Run…

“Jack, look this way for a sec!” A voice playfully called, and Jack turned around to spot Vanya sat down in the shade, leaning against the district wall with her camera pointed his way. 

And then there was Dante, who was lazily curled up next to her with bright eyes, panting from the heat of the day,  his faintly glowing fur crackling softly with occasional sparks of electricity. He lifted his head occasionally to watch the group, his intelligent eyes following their movements, but for the most part, he was content to supervise from his resting spot, wagging his tails whenever he noticed one of them was looking his way.

“And here we have the illustrious Jack, bravely doing manual labour in the sweltering heat,” Vanya narrated, the rabbit-girl grinning. “Is it heroism or just shirtless theatrics? We may never know!”

“Really, Vanya?” Jack sighed in amusement. 

“Hey, gotta get some shots for the blog!” The Chuna shamelessly grinned. “Not enough people know what you look like!”

“You do know there’s an active bounty on me, right?!” Jack pointed out. “People not knowing what I look like is probably a good thing!” 

*You literally featured on local TV for fighting the Klowns!* Chiyo helpfully pointed out. *So anyone determined enough will probably work it out!*

“Well it’s not like we need to make it easy for them!” Jack argued. 

“I’m sure there won’t be any problems with our bounties…” Alora argued. “We’ve still made a good impression in the city. 

“Oh really?” Jack deadpanned. “Perhaps you’ve forgotten about the dude high on enough cocaine to make Pablo Escobar jealous that’s threatened to go after absolutely anyone with an active bounty?”

“Hey, didn’t he team up with Devil’s Daughter?” Sephy asked. “That’s some of the rumours flying about. Her bounty is higher than any of ours!”

*The rumours are it wasn’t Commander Cocaine himself, more like one of his officers who got caught out,* Chiyo added. *Though they are known to have taken out one of House Mal’Kars deathsquads, had Devil’s Daughter not been there, it’s likely they’d have all been killed or captured by them. They probably didn’t have any choice in the matter.* 

 

“Glad to see she’s back at least.” Nika grinned. “About time the city gets some good news!”

“Hope she’s alright,” Jack mentioned. “I mean, the fact that she’s back probably means she is, but she hasn’t been seen since the party right after the night where she helped us out.”

“Maybe she just needed a break?”  Sephy shrugged.

“Sephy? How is setting up the remote piloting working out?” Alora asked as the Eladrie awkwardly began trying to screw on a bracket.

“It’s alright.” The Skritta shrugged. “I’ve got a basic cookie-cutter drone software I’m using, but the problem is configuring it for something this size. Power requirements, things not being to scale, you know, that kind of thing… 

*It’s a shame there isn’t a subject at school that teaches you how to work out things like that…* Chiyo deadpanned, rolling her eyes. *Oh wait, there is one. It’s called Maths!*

“Yeah and I have something to do all that complicated stuff for me Chiyo!” Sephy snorted. “It’s called a calculator, and I have software running that shit for me overnight while I do more interesting things! It’s so much better than studying!”  

“I think we’re done for today!” Alora announced as she finished screwing on the bracket, ending the argument before it could begin. “We’re not in any rush to get this done and we’ve all done very well so far! Let’s get back to it another day when we’re fresh!”

*Sounds good to me!* Chiyo agreed, as she hovered back to her normal height, more than happy to escape the manual labour. *What are our plans for tonight?*

“Well tomorrow is the last day of school before the holidays…” Nika reasoned. “And that’s when we’re finally playing our Deathball game…”

“About time we get a game!” Sephy scoffed, having been rather annoyed that the following two of their scheduled games after playing against Luvia’s team needed to be postponed. Though given their opponents had been affected by the recent Klown attack and the following Corporate War, she had understood Vaal agreeing with the opposing captains to reschedule their games for another date.

“And after that we’re heading to the Cathedral of Merriment after the game, since Kizzarith and Arlox are now healthy enough to join us,” Jack added.

“I’m sure I’m not the only non-deathball player looking forward to tagging along for that!” Vanya smiled with a wink at the human. “It’ll be good to see you loosen up a bit!”

“So considering our activities for the next couple of days, shall we go for a chill night watching some TV?” Alora asked the gathered group. 

“A chill night watching some TV,” everyone agreed. 

“Alright then!” Alora smiled. 

“We’ve earned it!”

\*\*\*\*\*

After a long day of working on the shuttle, the scent of soap and fresh clothes hung in the air as the team began settling down. Everyone had taken a brief cleansing dip in the hot tub, taking advantage of the magic of the Lesser Lifestone still unceremoniously sunk to the bottom to clean them up, and changed into more comfortable evening wear.

Jack was sprawled on the largest of the collection of sofas they had, happy to relax his eyes and doze off from the productive afternoon as he let his head rest against the soft back cushions. 

Sephy, ever the opportunist, quicky flopped down next to him, stretching out her legs before casually resting her bare feet on his lap.

Jack rolled his eyes but didn’t protest as his hands reflexively moved to knead at the soft skin of her feet, his thumbs pressing into the supple arches between the four large, dexterous toes on each foot before bringing his hand up to tickle them. It was a ritual the two of them had conducted many times over the weeks by this point despite Jack’s half-hearted protests. “You’re getting way too comfortable with this…” He chuckled, though the way his fingers still moved made it obvious he didn’t mind. 

Across the room, Nika was curled up in an armchair, lazily scrolling through her datapad as her tail swished back and forth. She glanced up, an amused smirk playing on her lips. “You know, I should probably be demanding the same service of you!”

“Hey, I’m not getting up for that!” Jack snorted. 

From the far end of the room, Alora and Chiyo sat near a small table, sipping from warm mugs of herbal tea. Alora, dressed in a soft blue nightgown with a thin cardigan draped over her shoulders, had a content smile on her face as she observed them all.

""You do look quite at home like that, Jack,"" she giggled. “You’ve come a long way since you first started living here!”

Chiyo, dressed in her usual oversized hoodie and shorts, gave a thoughtful nod of agreement, watching closely. *I agree.* she quickly murmured telepathically, taking a sip of her tea, before she smirked. *Oh, and I’m definitely next in line for foot-massage privileges!*

“Oh no, we’re not making this a thing!” Jack chuckled. 

“Yeah, it’s just an exclusive one-of-a-kind service for me only!” Sephy grinned.

“Someone should take a picture and stick it up on MyFace!” Nika suggested with an amused grin. 

“I agree, we totally should.” Alora quickly agreed with a mischievous smirk, snapping a picture on her commlink before Jack even had a chance to try and look natural.

Eventually, Vanya arrived, freshly showered and wearing a loose tank top and comfortable cotton shorts ""So. What did I miss?”

“Just me training Jack into being the perfect stress-relief tool!” Sephy shrugged as the others laughed.

“Hey that sounds like a good idea!” The Chuna answered with a playful grin, as with deliberate laziness she shifted over and plopped down right next to Jack, twisting around to casually lay down on the sofa, stretching her legs out over his lap and wiggling her toes. “If you’re offering foot massages, Jack, I’d just hate to be left out!” She purred. “I worked so hard today!”

“You didn’t do shit!” Nika snorted.    

“Hey, someone had to supervise all of you!” The Chuna answered brightly, though she gave Jack a wink from her layed-down position. “Who are we waiting for anyway?”

*A couple of others,* Chiyo answered. *I think the Squa’Kaar are having some pre-game nerves about their first Deathball game tomorrow, and a few of the others are trying to finish their homework.*

“Probably, but with all the practice we’ve done they should be totally fine for the game!” Sephy mentioned. “But don’t change the subject, Vanya!”

“I have no idea what you mean!” Vanya chucked, though she didn’t help her case as she poked Jack in the chest with one of her rabbit-like feet, before playfully hovering it in his face. “Jack! Your services are required!”

“You’re lucky you’ve got fur.” Jack snorted as he pushed the foot back down and idly began running his fingers through the soft brown hairs. “At least I don’t have to deal with cold feet like some people have!”

Sephy gasped in mock offense as Jack ticked one of her toes again to show he was only joking. “Excuse you! My feet are a perfectly acceptable temperature!”

“I don’t know, Vanya definitely has you beat!” He grinned, resuming Sephy’s massage while giving Vanya’s foot a testing press. Her warm fur was softer than he expected, and she let out a pleased hum.

“Mmm, not bad, Earth boy,” Vanya teased, ears flicking as she brought herself up in a pull-up and leaned against his shoulder. “I could get used to this.”

Alora smiled behind her tea as she checked her commlink. “And as expected, Luvia was rather quick to reply to my post! I suspect she’s now in the queue!”

Jack rolled his eyes but didn’t stop. “Damn freeloaders!”

The room filled with laughter as the sound of footsteps echoed down the hall as several of the others joined them, with Karzen, Bentom, Obeda and the Squa’Kaar chatting excitedly, likely about their plans for work in the future, while Hessia and a few others dutifully followed behind. The scent of fresh snacks followed as someone set down a tray of popcorn and drinks on the coffee table.

“Alright, alright, we’re here now! Budge over!” Karzen grinned, squeezing onto the couch.“Sorry guys! We needed to have a meeting about something”

“No apology needed!” Alora smiled. “How are things going? Need any help or advice from us?”

“All good!” Zayle smiled. “We were just looking for some jobs to do!

“We might need your advice on something later, but it can wait.” Bentom shrugged. “Right now we could do with a break, and we have a game tomorrow!”

“Too right!” Karzen grinned. “What are we all watching anyway?”

*That’s a good question,* Chiyo said.

Sephy and Vanya both perked up, causing Jack to shift uncomfortably as the movement poked him in the nuts. “Something trashy,” Sephy said.

“Something fun,” Vanya added.

Alora sighed as she took another swig of tea. “Something not filled with mindless explosions.”

Chiyo pushed up her glasses. *Something educational.*

Jack groaned, leaning back into the cushions. “We’re going to be here all night arguing, aren’t we?”

Nika smirked, thumb hovering over the button of the remote. “Pretty much, but hey, when I’ve got the remote democracy isn’t a concern!”

She clicked the button to turn the TV onto something random. 

Only for the latest news headlines to appear…

1iemjwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1iemjwc/dating_a_quiet_guy/,Dating a quiet guy,"I’ve never had a boyfriend. I’m in my mid-twenties and recently, I was introduced to this guy that is super quiet. I’m a yapper at heart and on our first date, this guy barely said a word, but he drove an hour to see me. I decided to be patient because my friend could vouch for him. Date number 2 was much better. He was more talkative, extremely chivalrous, respectful of my physical boundaries and not to mention, he’s tall and not too bad on the eyes. He’s a much better texter, which I don’t fault him for because I can be a “keyboard warrior” myself and he has mentioned over text how committed he is to making sure I feel safe and comfortable. One day, I was crying and I gave him a call. He held space for me so well and just listened and didn’t rush to offer advice, but was very intentional when he did speak. It was beautiful. So, now, I think he’s a great guy, but I’ve never been in a relationship, so I don’t know if I should give this time to allow love to grow and for him to open up more and more or if I actually need someone who can be a little more fun to talk to. This man does ALL the right things, but is not a thrill to talk to on the phone. But maybe, this crazy girl with ADHD needs a safe place to land when she comes home to a quiet, more reserved guy. So, does anyone have tips on dating someone WAY less talkative than you and how we can have a little bit more fun when we talk on the phone or go on coffee dates?",0,1738350509.0,dating_advice,7,0.5,False

1iemhwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1iemhwx/my_m45_wife_f45_had_an_affair_10_years_ago_now/,My [M45] wife [F45] had an affair 10 years ago now she is looking the guy up online,"We have been married 20 years. My wife has always wanted me to be more affectionate and wanted more sex (I know I am lucky!) About ten years ago she had what she called an emotional affair (I am pretty sure it went beyond emotional, but honestly that line matters less to me than the emotional boundaries). Recently, I have been really working to give her the affection and sex at the level she has always wanted/desired. Randomly, I decided to look on her computer to see if she ever searched for anything sex related so I have a better sense of what she may be into. At first, I did find a few small hints in her search history, but nothing earth shattering. But, I also found in her search history that she has been searching online for the guy she had an affair with. Not one time, but several different days/weeks, she seems to have searched for his general info (looking at old myspace pages, Poshmark page, and things like this but they all seem to reveal not much/not be active) as well as a few of his relatives and even looking at Zillow on the house I think he lives in (I think he still lives with his mom). Before everyone freaks out saying I violated her privacy, she has ALWAYS made it clear sharing her passwords for her phone and laptop telling me she wants me to know I can look on them at any time. The thing is I think she is REALLY happy right now, and we seem to be doing great other than what I found in her search history. Could it be that me finally being more affectionate as she requested 10 years ago sparked guilt? or wanting closure with this guy? I should add that economically and culturally/educationally, my wife and I are in a MUCH better spot than this guy, so I don't think he has anything to offer her other than she could ""save"" him or be more of the partner in a position of power. I also read one comment online saying if a SO is searching for someone, you know they have no contact with that person (which is a good thing), but I can't help but wanting to know WTF why after 10 years is she searching for this guy? Also, I think this confirms she did go beyond emotions with him, I can't imagine some texts from 10 years ago and a few coffee dates being deep enough emotionally that TEN years later you need closure or what to know what he is up to in life. Am I over reacting? Should I call her out? Once I call her out, she will realize I can see her searches and might just prevent me from seeing future insights and/or I really don't want to even get into a fight over this because we are in such a good place (other than this) right now. Am a fool if I ignore this?

tl;dr: Marriage has never been better, but all the sudden my wife is searching online for the guy she cheated with. ",1,1738350372.0,marriageadvice,4,1.0,False

i don’t drive so i need a really walkable area where ill be able to easily get to work and run errands all on foot. i’ll likely be working in restaurants or retail so somewhere with a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops or small storefronts would be ideal. i’m young and far from wealthy so i’d appreciate recommendations that are considered safe and  more affordable.

i’m currently living in a small historic neighborhood with two main roads with lots of businesses and is just off the city center and i really enjoy it so i’d love to find something similar that’s not in the midwest!

I would drive one of the dealership's vehicles that we want to highlight to your business and film myself using your services vlog-style whether that's picking up food, coffee, or other goods. Our account would then post the reel and send a collaboration request on Instagram so that both of our pages benefit from the reach and views the content produces.

A couple days later he called me and asked me on a date (!).  We send each other interesting things on instagram, and we text or talk on the phone pretty much daily.  

Date day - he brings me coffee from a coffee shop near him I hadn’t been to in a long time but love.  We go axe throwing and get something to eat afterwards.  I think we could have talked all night.  He was a gentleman - attentive and thoughtful.  Funny, smart, great conversationalist, attractive, smelled great, kissed me good night.  We agreed this was a great date and want to see each other again soon.  

I got the good morning text (something I didn’t necessarily get before now) and we’ve texted a bit today, reflecting on how great last night was, but not much else.  Part of me wants to push this along and make the next date, but another wants me to let him lead this.  What do I do? I should add we do have some concert dates set for March and April, but that feels far away to wait to see him. Thanks!! ",3,1738350253.0,datingoverforty,24,0.8,False

1iemelq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iemelq/likely_developed_health_anxiety_and_looking_for/,Likely developed health anxiety and looking for advice,"Hi all,

signed up here with the hope that someone could read my story and come up with some ideas or advice. Apologies for the wall of text, I tried to put it as concise as possible without leaving out important details.

I am a 31-year-old male, never did any hard drugs and live a totally normal life with my girlfriend. There are no major diseases known in family. Most certainly I spend way too much time in front of a desk either working, studying or playing video games. My spine is probably the body part I have treated the worst by far. I try to hit the gym three times a week.

I had my first experience with illness anxiety and potentially hypochondria (both not medically confirmed) almost three years ago when I noticed some slight burning pain in my throat. I went seeing a doctor and he told me it might be the reflux disease. Even though I hadn’t changed my diet or wasn’t eating unusual things I followed his advice and changed my diet plus took pills to calm my stomach. The pills seemed to help a little however the described feeling continued to last for weeks, and I started to worry a little. I stopped to drink coffee and alcohol, no more fast food and different, more healthy breakfast. Nothing seemed to have any effect, so I asked for a gastroscopy. Nothing was found during the examination so hoped the feeling would eventually just go away, which it did a few weeks later and never returned. Until today, I have no idea what caused it. Shortly after I returned to my former eating habits and no longer took any pills. Still, the feeling did never return.

About a year later I noticed a different strange feeling in the bottom right of my belly. It felt bloated in this area, and it also seemed to intensify whenever I was sitting for a longer period. I was very chill at that time but still wanted to find out what it was as I hadn’t changed my lifestyle in any way. No doctor I visited in the next two months could tell me anything about it or make it disappear.  
I started to do research on the internet and of course I first came across reasons like stress and bad food but later also unlikely reasons like different sorts of tumors.

Unlike in the “throat pain”-story, I was more worried this time and I had a hard time stopping to think about it or avoiding further online research. This was maybe the first time when I started to exaggerate the situation. I cannot tell why but I relatively quickly started to believe it must be something dramatic this time which could potentially kill me in the long run if not treated.

I visited two or three doctors, but none could explain it to me or make it go away so I made an appointment for a colonoscopy but at the same time ordered two self-testing kits of Amazon to check for blood in my you-know-what. Both tests turned out negative and I started to relax. So much even that I cancelled the colonoscopy appointment and also because I read about the involved risks online.  
A few weeks later and with the feeling in my belly still being present, I started to worry again and I made another appointment which I took this time.  
Nothing could be found, all good. I started to relax again after this and tried to ignore the symptoms from now on. I don’t know when exactly, but the feeling disappeared after a few more weeks and never came back. I never discovered what it was, and I also didn’t change any of my habits or diet.

After that anxiety episode I had a at least two more over the next years which I want to describe only briefly:

* I had problems to fall asleep which I believed could be some rare form of insomnia leading to death due to fatigue. It took me sometimes 3-4 hours to fall asleep but usually the next night was fine. Those sleeping problems happened quite often until recent, especially when sleeping not at home but I never spend a full night awake. It was during this time that I also encountered my first moment of panic or very strong discomfort: I was with friends at a birthday and suddenly with no reason I started to feel extremely uncomfortable and had to leave the room. I went to the bathroom and tried to calm myself in front of the mirror. The feeling is hard to describe but at this moment I wanted to hide myself somewhere and not come out again until I felt better. It lasted for ten minutes and then I was OK again and returned to the birthday. If I remember correct, I had two similar events in the past two years. One time I couldn’t leave the room, so I sat quietly and waited for the feeling to pass, which it did after five minutes or so. The last event of such form is now almost 6 months ago, gladly.
* Minor pain inside my left chest which wouldn’t go away for a couple of weeks. I read articles online about early symptoms of liver cirrhosis and actually considered it. I had my blood checked and liver examined with ultrasonic. Nothing could be found, and the pain disappeared a few weeks later.

Very recently, another anxiety episode has started and of course you might think “this is the same thing, it’s obviously psychological and nothing to actually worry about”, but like before I take it seriously and I am worried about a severe illness again.  
This time it frightens me even more and I am having strong difficulties getting it out of my thoughts:

In August 2024 I started noticing a strange minor pain in my right calf, which I feel until present day. On some days it is less intense and on other days it is more present and radiates into my foot and thigh. I started running during this time and as I am a bloody amateur of course I thought it might have something to do with the wrong shoes or me not running correctly. I went to an orthopedist, and he had no idea what it could be. When I mentioned that I started running recently, he was sure that it has something to do with it and I should pause for a while. This pause is still going on, so I doubt it has anything to do with me not running properly in August last year or using the wrong shoes.

Because the orthopedist couldn’t help me (I visited another and he said the same thing as the first), I started researching and after some time came across MS and ALS which caught my attention. I wasn’t concerned about such illness at this moment, but a few days later new symptoms of all sorts started to appear: brief muscle twitches, cold hands and feet, tingling under my skin and very slight numbness from time to time. I started to worry more even though I knew chances of developing such a rare illness right after reading about it for the first time, are more than slim.

I saw a Neurologist and had a MRT of my head done (without contrast medium). The MRT results came back clean, nothing unusual detected. My neurologist was happy, case closed for him, and I still had no answers to what was going on.

The weeks passed by, and I slowly managed to accept my situation and paresthesia.

By mid-December 2024 all the described symptoms had disappeared except the pain in my calf and the muscle twitching (decreased in frequency though). However, whenever I turn my head to the right now, it starts shaking slightly and the shaking radiates into both shoulders and upper arms. I turn my head to the left and the shaking stops. I have the feeling that the intensity increases when I am under pressure e.g. fight with my girlfriend, important presentation at work, etc. but I cannot tell for sure. On a lot of days, I also wake up with a tension in my neck and upper back which sometimes result in headaches. I sometime also “check” my body in the mirror if all muscles are looking OK and functioning properly.  
I had minor problems with my upper spine before, nothing was ever diagnosed but one time I had to stop working and lay down because I felt dizzy suddenly and developed a pain in my upper spine. The dizziness was completely gone the next day, but the pain lasted a few more days. Similar issues when I bought a new car, I couldn’t drive it for more than ten minutes before strong back pain started to develop in my upper spine. Gladly this didn’t last for long and today I still drive the car but without any back pain.

Coming back to the slight shaking of my head, my neurologist first thought it is another symptom of my described anxiety but once I showed him, he said I should go see an orthopedist and this isn’t anything in his area of expertise because of the way I can trigger and make it stop by turning my head.

This is pretty much where I am right now. I booked myself a first appointment with a psychologist in the coming week but cannot let go of the feeling that everything I did in the past was normal and that there is something in me which just has not been discovered yet. With going to a psychologist, I have the feeling that I am moving in the wrong direction and no longer focusing on the actual symptoms and their reason.

I want to add that even though I am thinking about the described a couple times per day, it doesn’t control me, and I live a totally normal life. I haven’t shared these thoughts with anyone except my girlfriend. I want to get rid of the symptoms and find a way to remain way more calm.  
For me this feels like an important task that I want to complete but never find the time to do it, so it keeps sitting on my TODO list and bothers me every day a little when I look at the list.

If you made it till here, my sincere thanks. I hope somebody can provide me with some advice.",2,1738350149.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

At this point, I really think Amaya is a cover of The Rapture pt. 3... same chord progression, same rhythm... just a slightly different key. I guess this is ok? It just seems, idk... confusing that such similar tracks could be released so close to each other and not yield some sort of corporate take-down. I guess EDM at this level is too small to care? Black Coffee is certainly huge. I suppose it is possible that both BC and G composed the same thing at the same time?

1iembn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety_support/comments/1iembn7/anxiety_in_weird_situations_heres_how_to_quietly/,Anxiety in Weird Situations? Here’s How to Quietly Fix It Without Anyone Noticing,"Ever been in a completely normal situation—maybe standing in line, sitting in class, or just chilling with friends—when suddenly, out of nowhere, anxiety *hits*? Your heart starts racing, your palms sweat, and your thoughts spiral into a tornado of *what-ifs*. The worst part? You have to act like nothing’s wrong because, well, you don’t want anyone to notice.  

I get it. And if you’re reading this, you do too.  

Anxiety doesn’t always wait for the “right time.” Sometimes, it strikes in the most random, *inconvenient* places—while ordering coffee, in the middle of a conversation, or when you're just trying to enjoy life like a normal person. It’s frustrating, embarrassing, and exhausting.  

But here’s the thing: **you can take back control**—without making it obvious. I’ve been experimenting with subtle ways to shut down anxiety before it spirals, and today, I’m sharing the ones that actually *work*.  

---

### **1. The “Five-Second Reboot” (Short-Circuit Overthinking)**  
Anxiety thrives on *thought loops*. You start overanalyzing, predicting disaster, and before you know it, you’re drowning in your own mind.  

Try this: **Interrupt the loop by counting down from five.**  

- 5… Notice the tension in your body.  
- 4… Loosen your shoulders, unclench your jaw.  
- 3… Take a slow, deep breath.  
- 2… Shift your focus to *something* in your environment (a sound, a color, an object).  
- 1… Remind yourself: **""I am safe. I am here. I am okay.""**  

By the time you hit *one*, your brain has momentarily reset, and the panic loses momentum.  

---

### **2. “I Meant to Do That” (Flip the Script on Physical Symptoms)**  
One of the worst things about anxiety? The *physical symptoms*. The shaky hands, the racing heart, the sudden dizziness—ugh.  

But here’s a trick: **Reframe it as something you *chose* to do.**  

- Feeling shaky? *""I must be excited.""*  
- Heart pounding? *""That’s just my body gearing up—like an athlete before a race.""*  
- Lightheaded? *""Oh, I must have been holding my breath. Let me fix that.""*  

It sounds simple, but it *works*. Your brain is surprisingly gullible—if you *tell* it you’re excited instead of anxious, it often believes you.  

---

### **3. The “Secret Reset” (Nobody Will Know You’re Doing It)**  
When you’re stuck in a social setting, you can’t exactly close your eyes and start deep breathing without looking weird. But here’s something you *can* do, *without anyone noticing*:  

- **Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth** (engages your parasympathetic nervous system).  
- **Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 2, exhale for 6** (triggers a relaxation response).  
- **Wiggle your toes** inside your shoes (grounds you instantly).  

This is my go-to in meetings, conversations, or anywhere I *need* to keep my cool but feel my anxiety creeping up.  

---

### **4. “Pick a Person” (Steal Their Calm Energy)**  
Ever notice how some people just *radiate* calm? They’re sitting there, completely unbothered, while you’re internally combusting.  

Here’s a hack: **Mentally ""borrow"" their energy.**  

- Find the most relaxed person in the room.  
- Imagine stepping into their mindset—how would they feel in this moment?  
- Match their breathing. Slow down. Absorb their calm.  

Your brain *mirrors* what it focuses on. Instead of zooming in on your panic, sync up with someone who looks like they’re on vacation. It works like a charm.  

---

### **5. The “Movie Scene Trick” (Detach from the Panic)**  
Anxiety makes everything feel *personal*. But what if you could zoom out and watch yourself like a character in a movie?  

- Imagine the scene playing out on a screen.  
- Picture yourself as an actor—how would they handle this?  
- Pretend you’re *observing* the situation instead of living it.  

This creates instant distance between you and your emotions, making them way easier to manage.  

---

### **Final Thoughts: You’re Not Alone**  
I know what it’s like to feel hijacked by anxiety. To desperately want to act normal while your brain is throwing a full-on *meltdown*. But the truth is—you’re stronger than it.  

These tricks don’t “cure” anxiety, but they **give you back control** when you need it most. And sometimes, that’s all you need to make it through the moment.  

Now, I want to hear from *you*—what’s your weirdest anxiety moment, and how did you handle it? Drop a comment, and let’s build a list of lowkey anxiety hacks together.  ",2,1738349958.0,anxiety_support,1,1.0,False

1iem8an,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1iem8an/i_am_terrified_and_am_considering_a_restraining/,"I am terrified and am considering a restraining order, do I have grounds?","I recently (last Monday) went full no contact with my abusive family members after moving out. My mother has began contacting every local store (within 60 mile )in a coffee chain that I work at. She also managed to contact my landlord with my exact apartment number asking go speak to me. 

I am genuinely terrified to leave my home or show up for work. 

For more context:

I am in NC and my mother is (hopefully still) in Texas.

I (F22) recently moved out of my grandparents house after about a year of single-handedly taking care of my elderly grandmother following my grandfathers death. After he passed, my sister (who lived across the country in the same town as my mother) made moves to have their will changed so that she would receive everything, and the deed to the farm was signed over to her in August. 

I begged for help as I am chronically ill and not suited to single-handedly take care of an elderly woman with dementia and many health issues, and finally got social services involved at the end of July. Around August/September, my sister informed me that she was moving in January and I needed to be about of the house. 

Upon leaving, I blocked them all and deleted my Facebook as it was their primary way of reaching me. 

My mother (who I believe to still be across the country, but does have the means to travel if she wishes) has begun harassing all of my potential workplaces asking for me or my partner. She reached out to my landlord. She reached out to my partners’ mother. 

I am, once again, terrified. 

Would I be overreacting by pursuing legal action?

(Edit, if anybody needs anecdotal reasons to be fearful)

She is psychotic. She threatened to kill me multiple times throughout high school, would purposely swerve on the highway to scare me, would talk about killing my stepdad. She financially  and emotionally abused my sister by filing fake police reports against her and using her personal information to take out accounts for credit cards and other services. She once threw herself across my sister’s car and told the police my sister hit her and ran. She has the money to travel and works from home. This is harassment.

1iem7wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneWomen/comments/1iem7wd/the_worst_part_of_being_alone_is_how_desperately/,The worst part of being alone is how desperately you cling to the few connections you have,"Most of us here have never experienced romantic relationships, which is bad, but it's even worse when you have little to no friendships or familial connections. I'm soon-to-be 30, work from home, and an only child of a single mother I rarely talk to. I have two friends who are much more successful than me in just about every aspect. They're married with loving partners (one just had her baby!), so I understand that I will always be a second priority or an afterthought to them.   
  
But damn does it get lonely. I try to be super mindful and not bug them with constant messages just because I am bored. I have a personal rule of not messaging them more than twice back-to-back. After that, I'll simply wait for them to respond even if it takes days or weeks because I don't want to be annoying. It's not their fault I have no one else to share things with. But still, I feel like I must be the sad ""energy vampire"" they have to nourish occasionally. 

I try to go out and at least sit in coffee shops, but people usually don't approach me unless it's to compliment my outfit (side note: what is it with the teenage girls who smirk at me whenever I'm in a coffee shop by myself???). I'm so desperate for human connection that I spend hours scrolling social media just to remind myself other people are real. It feels like I'm not only lonely but wasting the majority of my life looking at a screen.

1iem6by,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iem6by/things_that_have_helped_me_move_forward_and_get/,Things that have helped me move forward and get my brain back,"Constant self love and affirmation work. My ex would degrade me all the time (especially during sex, which he claimed was “consensual”, but the thing is I asked him to stop all the time 🫠 and he would be like oh well I need it to get off so we have to break up. And I’d be like okay, let’s break up. And then he’d be like no please I don’t actually need it like that much please stay with me. And then the whole cycle would repeat.) Some of the things he said can still make me cry but it’s okay to still be sad and sensitive over it I think, especially the fact he cut “cumdump” into me. Bullying yourself out of your emotions isn’t self love! Being there for yourself is. So I let myself cry. And I affirm myself. A good example is when you have a really bad thought or get trapped in some cycle with it, you ask yourself what the negative word you’re associating yourself with is. So I always get trapped in like “ugly” or “crazy” or “stupid”. And then you say to yourself “I love you ugly girl.” “I love you, especially because you’re crazy.” “I love you, Mary, especially your big stupid heart”. I affirm myself before bed, I affirm myself as my brain is waking up in the morning, I affirm myself when I make mistakes. I affirm myself when I’m having sex, I affirm myself when I’m having hard conversations. The more you practice it the more it will become instinct. And the better you treat yourself the better you will treat people closest to you— which is how we avoid what we fear most: becoming like them. 


-Shifting the energy I have for “getting answers” for things I never will get answers for no matter how much I pick at scabs toward being more curious. I’ve discovered that a great gift I’ve been given by PTSD is total information euphoria 🥲🥲 do anything except pick at the stitches!!! Get curious. Go to the library and pick the first book that sounds good. Get your brain BACK from them. They keep you trapped trying to control their actions to avoid the consequences their lack of control has, and it becomes hard and even painful to drag yourself away from that. But it’s possible!!! 


-Lowering cortisol by utilizing exercises to activate the parasympathetic nervous system!!! I like drawing my breath, eft technique, the universal sigh, body scans, hugging myself, and sound baths. 


-REWARD YOURSELF. You probably spend a lot of money and time rewarding them in the hopes they’ll be a good partner to you, right? What if I told you that you could be that good partner to yourself, and rewire your brain to stop risking your life seeking it out from them? Spend the money on yourself instead. Pay off your debt before you have time to think about that gift they want, stop babying a grown adult who beats you up and treats you like shit, it won’t encourage them to change, it only incentivizes them to stay even though they hate you. I’d stay with someone I wanted dead until I could find someone else too if they made me coffee every morning and did my laundry. Buy the nice jam at the grocery store and hide it from them. Get mildly expensive bath soap and put it in an inconspicuous bottle, whatever. You’ll actually become a better person with those rewards, and you’ll treat yourself better. 


-Stretch! Do yoga. Pick a beginner’s flexibility routine on YouTube. It’s good for mobility, and humans are animals. Our bodies are trained for our environment. If you stretch your body, you’re resetting your tense muscles and making your environment new to you again. This is so necessary for getting out of such a toxic place— making it all NEW to your brain again. It’s incredibly painful and you’ll hate it, but it will get you out of there.

1iem5y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDIreland/comments/1iem5y2/heart_rate_on_tyvense/,Heart Rate on Tyvense,"Hi folks,

I’m currently in the first month of my titration period on Tyvense.

I started on 30mg and got my GP to do my BP and HR 3 days in which was 135/87 and 90bpm.

I spent a week on 30mg and I’m now on week 3 of 40mg.

I couldn’t get a reading for my BP and HR during my first week of 40mg as I was off sick from work. But last week (week 2 on 40mg) a nurse in work took my BP, HR and ran an ECG. Numbers were 136/80, 110bpm, and blood oxygen was 96. The increased HR could be seen in the ECG. I didn’t get a great nights sleep the night before so we ran some more numbers later this week.

Yesterday my BP, HR, and blood oxygen levels were 127/79, 103bpm, and 97. Today they were 114/77, 107bpm (I watched it go from 93 and up as she was doing it) and 98.

I work in a hospital so I’m busy and moving around quite a lot. Whenever the nurses are free to check my numbers I’m usually just after coming from another department and not been at rest. Since starting meds, when I am sitting, my Fitbit tells me my HR is anywhere between 80-95bpm. But I’m not sure how accurate that is. Before meds my average HR was 71bpm. 

I’ve had no major issues on tyvense and it’s made a huge difference to my overall mental health. I’m also on SSRIs (roughly 1 month) and off all caffeine since I started tyvense with the only side effect being occasional sweating or feeling like I’ve low blood sugar. The nurses have been telling me that it’s just my body trying to figure out what’s going on as well as going through caffeine withdrawal as I used to drink energy drinks/coffee during my workday.

I need to submit my numbers to ADHD Doc this week for my next prescription. My question is, are these values considered too high or worrying enough for me to be taken off Tyvense and moved onto another brand? ",2,1738349553.0,ADHDIreland,2,1.0,False

“Something isn’t right here  



I’m not messed up in the head  



They’ve made a fool of all of us”  



Is what the vagrant said  

.  

  

Outside a techie office  



A sign held above his head  



“Aliens live among us”  



Scribbled in bright red  

.  

  

Howling his conspiracies  



At white collars marching in  



His words whiff right by them  



Like a frigid gust of wind  

.



“Humans can sense danger  



A primal skill deep inside  



So don’t tell me that I’m crazy  



When the news feeds us lies”  

.  



Then in the foggy sky above  



A black drone buzzes past  



Metal eyes gaze down on him  



A rapid camera flash  

.  



The vagrant jumps and hollers  



But it soars above the roof  



Fades into the clouds  



Leaves him with no proof  

.  



And a busy business woman  



Who sees his panicked looks  



Scoffs and shakes her head  



Wonders what drugs he took  

.  



His fraught eyes fall onto hers  



Making foreign contact  



He huffs up to the office door  



Blocks her path beyond it  

.  



He says “Disinformation  



Is how they keep it under wraps  



Else we’d all come to realize  



That they have attacked”  

.  



She composes, takes a breath  



“Buddy, there’s no big ‘them’  



Pulling all the media strings  



Just a mindless algorithm”  

.  



So she simply steps around  



Into a glassy lobby  



Rides an elevator up and  



Stops for a free coffee  

.  

 



Then in a cold meeting room  



Light off a projector gleams  



She stands at the front  



Coworkers lost in screens  

.  



She spouts corporate drivel  



The music to their scrolling  



Until she spots the vagrant  



Way down below patrolling  

.  



He looks up at the window  



Like he somehow sees her  



It snaps her out of focus  



She fumbles with her words  

.  



Meeting over now  



Human resources file out  



A boss man lingers  



Asks her to hang about  

.  



He says “We can’t afford to fall behind  



Or that’ll be our end  



And you know exactly what we need  



To keep up with the trends”  

.  



“So drop what you’re doing  



Make those changes right away  



I need you to get it done  



By latest end of day”  

.  



She glances out the window  



A circling flea, the vagrant shuffles  



Boss man notices her distraction  



Gives a hearty crack of his knuckles  

.  



“And get rid of that vagrant  



He’s an ugly stain  

 

We’ve got investors coming  



To hear about their gains”  

.  



Back in the lobby  



She wavers by a security stand  



“Miss, can I help you?”  



She nods, yes you can  

.  



“You see, there’s this vagrant  



Loitering outside  



And… he tried to touch me  



Here on my backside”  

.  



She shows security where he is  



And they corner the vagrant  



Security drags him off as  



He screams a final statement  

.  



“Don’t you see,  



Soon all will be lost  



Powerful figures betray us  



They manipulate your every thought!”  

.  



His red face stares her down  



A familiar signal beaming in  



And she feels the full heat of it  



Sizzling under her skin  

.  



Moments later she’s inside  



Tromps to the lift and  



Tries to shake it off  



Frazzles be damned  

.  



She mutters to herself  



A reassurance that must be said  



“Everything’s fine round here  



I’m not messed up in the head”  

.  



Upstairs she adjusts her jacket  



Checks her emails, jots to-do’s  



Abruptly stands and  



It’s time to follow through  

.

Out the exit she sighs  



Another day, another buck

She quietly observes  



On crowded train ride home  



The deafening silence of  



People glued to their phones

On her budget couch  



Over a microwave meal she mourns  



While TV news rambles of  

 

Another culture war

In bed her body won’t settle  



The day’s deeds leave her vacant  



Outside a black drone buzzes  



And she thinks of the vagrant

1ielrgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1ielrgw/lidl_perfume_dupes_honest_review/,Lidl Perfume Dupes – Honest Review,"I don’t see many honest reviews of Lidl’s perfume dupes online—just a lot of hype—and since many of them aren’t even on Fragrantica, I thought I’d share my thoughts in case anyone is interested in cheap (4 euros), surprisingly close and unsurprisingly short lived clones. 

**Overall:** I really enjoy having Lidl’s dupes in my collection. They are not and will never be the real thing. They don’t last as long, they don’t project as well, and the scent is never 1:1. Also the first spray smells terribly alcoholic. But they allow me to play with perfumes in a way I’d never do with the originals.

To give you an example, I rarely use some of my favorite perfumes, like Khamrah, Kenzo Jungle L’Elephant, and Givenchy L’Interdit, because they last so long and project so much that I don’t always have occasions to wear them.

With these dupes, I can wear them to the office, restaurants, or coffee shops without worrying about bothering anyone. They don’t last long, true, but that means I can switch up my perfume in the middle of the day if I want to. And I can spray clothes, pillows, shower curtains—whatever I want—and have them smell like some of my favorite perfumes.

# Suddenly Lovely – J’adore dupe

This is a bit more shampoo-like than the original J’adore. I think it’s juicier, with more pear and freshness. If the sweetness of the original J’adore is too much for you (as it is for me), this might be a good alternative, though it’s still very sweet.

I use it as a hair perfume since my shampoo doesn’t leave a scent. That way, it lasts for 3–4 hours, and a lot of people have commented on how nice my shampoo smells, lol. I’ve also sprayed it liberally on clothes, where it lasts for days but as a subtle scent. On my skin, it gives me two hours max.

# Suddenly Madame Glamour – Coco Mademoiselle dupe

I’ve only ever smelled the original in stores. I think it’s nice but a bit too much for me, so I can’t say exactly how similar they are. From what I can tell, this one is a bit lighter, muskier, and heavier on the citrus. But I believe that to everyone except you, it will smell just like the original.

It’s citrusy, patchouli-heavy, and sweet. Perfumes don’t usually last on my skin, and this gives me two hours until it becomes a soapy skin scent. I would never buy Coco Mademoiselle—it’s not my style—but I enjoy spraying this in the afternoons when I know I’ll stay home. Since it smells a bit more grown-up to me, I’ve also worn it to run errands.

# Suddenly Cotton Blue – D&G Light Blue dupe

I don’t enjoy citrusy scents at all, and this is even more citrusy than the original. In its favor, I’d say it doesn’t have that terrible lemony cleaning product smell that even some overpriced perfumes do. It’s more like lemon candy, just like the original.

To my nose, this one is a bit sweeter, less woody, and overall less sophisticated than D&G Light Blue. But if you enjoy lemony scents, this is a perfect summer perfume, and most people wouldn’t be able to tell it’s not Light Blue. Like most citrus perfumes, it doesn’t last at all on my skin—hour and a hald max—but the same thing happens with D&G. I’m keeping this to see if I change my mind in the summer since I bought it in autumn.

Of all the Lidl dupes, this is the only bottle I actually don’t mind having on display. The others really scream “cheap dupe,” lol.

# Stylish Girl – Good Girl dupe

This is a bit more vanilla-heavy and gourmand than the original, with less of the floral aspects. I actually think this makes it an even easier everyday perfume, especially for colder weather. It's a very safe office scent, and transitions perfectly from the office to a night out. 

It’s a bit more screechy than the original, and to my nose, the notes aren’t as well blended, but since it doesn’t project that much, no one else but you will notice. It’s a perfectly safe scent for autumn and winter days or nights, especially if you enjoy a more gourmand take on this style of perfume.

# Monogotas Vainilla – Bonus Review

I’ve only seen people from Portugal and Spain talking about this one, so I don’t know if it’s available in other countries. It costs around 3 euros and smells like vanilla —pure vanilla, like dousing yourself in vanilla extract. I didn’t buy it; I just tested it at the store.

I’m not a gourmand girlie, so this wasn’t for me, but I think it would be perfect for anyone looking for a realistic vanilla scent to layer with other perfumes. I was also surprised it’s not more talked about.

Since it’s an eau de toilette, I assumed it wouldn’t last long, but I must have gone anosmic to it because when I got home about an hour later, my partner commented that I smelled like vanilla. Maybe two hours after that, I still caught the scent every now and then, and I had only sprayed a tiny bit on the back of my arm. I don’t understand why no one else is talking about this!",6,1738348544.0,FemFragLab,1,1.0,False

1ielplj,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1ielplj/new_to_gravel_need_help/,"New to gravel, need help","Hi all, I am a long time road cyclist. I currently have a Specialized Tarmac SL7 with Ultegra 12 speed di2 that I absolutely love.  I am looking to get into gravel cycling and I need help choosing a bike.  I will be buying used.  I live in the midwest (USA) with lots of packed down rural gravel roads where I will be doing most of my gravel cycling. I will not be doing any cyclocross or trail type riding and no gravel races.

  
I have been looking at a used Cervelo Aspero with SRAM Rival AXS 1x.  From things I have read, this seems to be catered to fast riding with a more aggressive geometry.  A lot of people have said it is almost a road bike with gravel capabilities.  The trend in gravel cycling seems to be to put wider and wider tires on the bike, and the Aspero is limited in that it can only fit 40mm tires (at least for the 2022 bike that I am looking at.)  Most of my gravel riding will be very casual rides with my girlfriend going from small town to small town to stop at coffee shops or bars.  I do want the ability to throw some slick tires on for when I want to do casual road/paved trail riding but don't want to bring my Tarmac. 

  
I guess my question is do any of you Aspero owners or any owners of a gravel bike with 40mm tires wish you could put wider tires on it?  I am also considering a Specialized Diverge since it has a more relaxed geometry and can fit wider tires.  As far as the geometry is concerned though, the Aspero is very similar to my Tarmac which I find quite comfortable, I am just not sure how that riding position translates from smooth roads to bumpy gravel.

  
Any thoughts or insights on tire size and racey gravel bike vs. relaxed bikepacking type of gravel bike is appreciated. Thanks!",1,1738348409.0,gravelcycling,4,1.0,False

**Chapter VI**

**Holy Warrior**

Astral followed the Fallen Angel, Lucifer Morningstar. At first he thought the angel was moving at impossible speeds, but as he flew with his wings out in this new state he felt his own speed increase and as he looked down he saw that people moved far slower. He had to take a moment to appreciate what he was seeing, and he was still able to follow Lucifer, the energy that radiated off him was impossible to ignore. Then he realized Lucifer had stopped and he locked in on the Fallen.

He landed at a long abandoned theme park far out from Tokyo. It was older than it had any right to be and looked like a tetanus shot was needed just to look at it. He saw Lucifer standing at an old vending machine counting out yen coins from nearly a century ago. 

“I don’t suppose you have a 50 Yen coin?” Lucifer asked, “I really want a toffee apple.” 

“I don’t.” Astral said as he walked up and smacked the machine, it shook and sparked before dropping several snacks down to its bin. “But I got gremlins.” 

“No, you’re just a tech bane.” Lucifer yawned as he pulled out a crusty looking apple and frowned. “These used to hold forever.” He tossed it over his shoulder.

Astral snorted, “How do I get as fast as you?” 

“You don’t.” Lucifer frowned as he pulled up a pastry stuffed with creme. “And contrary to popular belief, this does not last forever. But long enough.” He opened the pastry and promptly began to eat it.

“What, is it some sort of gift from God?” Astral asked.

Lucifer nodded, but then shook his head. “Each angel has an area of the cosmos we are expected to keep in order. I was space, stars and light. I still am, technically.” 

Astral blinked.

“I was exiled, not relieved of my responsibilities. However being stuck on Earth leaves it a hard task to complete.” Lucifer sighed, “Not that I could do anything outside of our system. Remember, I’m not just Lucifer Morningstar, I am _the_ Morningstar. Supposedly.” 

“You’re talking in circles now.” Astral sighed.

“I do that.” Lucifer grinned, “But if I had been smart enough to not rebel, or perhaps not too arrogant, I would possibly have descendants who would share traits from those gifts My Lord gave me.”  Lucifer sat on a bench and chewed happily.

“Why didn’t you?” Astral asked.

“Fallen cannot, we keep the nearly unlimited immortality when we are exiled and denied the ability to have mortal kin.” Lucifer nodded, “It didn’t stop me from having a few adopted families, mind you, but it stings every time you watch them grow old. Thankfully you won’t have that issue.”

Astral had been bending down to look at the snacks, he stopped and looked up at the Fallen. Then he stood straight again and nodded as he hung his coat up on a pole. 

“You still have questions.” Lucifer noted, “And your mind must not be burdened.” 

“Why did you rebel, for real?” Astral asked.

“What child doesn’t, when they ‘know’ they are right, even with all the evidence that says they are wrong, right in front of them.” Lucifer sighed, “I was a fool, but my penance is on this world, and it shall be paid.”  

“So He does know all?” Astral asked, “Otherwise, shouldn’t your regret count for something?” 

Lucifer chuckled, “My Lord, my Father, is brilliant in ways you cannot comprehend, but not infallible or omnipresent. Very few things in this universe can be and those that can should be feared above all.” 

Astral pulled up a broken stool and jammed it in the ground to sit on. 

“What He can do is see far into his own past and communicate with himself from all potential timelines.” Lucifer smiled, “Kind of cheating, but I always thought it was smart. There was a movie that utilized something similar in thought, but it was flawed.” 

Astral nodded, “Then why me, why now, why here?” 

Lucifer shrugged, “Why did they not teach you, what angels abandon their kind like this?” 

“I’ve only met one actual angel and that was because some Cardinal had someone call it down. And that angel wasn’t happy.” Astral explained. 

Lucifer tilted his head, “Do the thaumaturgists not call our kin down to teach you? I bloody well taught them how to summon us when I was first ordered to help mankind! Gabriel taught them too! Drooling fools kept summoning Raphael. It was funny, but it got old fast.” 

Astral shook his head, “I was raised as a soldier of God, trained to fight daemons.” 

“You were trained to die.” Lucifer scoffed, and shook his head in frustration. 

“Yeah, I’m realizing that more and more.” Astral leaned back and looked to the sky, clouds covered the sky blue he loved to see. “Sad I can’t fly as fast as you, flying and walking are my happy places.” 

“Honestly, it will depend on your progenitor.” Lucifer shrugged, “Pray it isn’t Raphael, just pray.” 

Astral snorted, “I’ll keep that prayer tucked away. And what’s this about a tech bane?” 

“Angels are beings of holy power, it doesn’t always mix well with technology.” Lucifer shrugged, “Blame the fools who tried to build the tower of Babel.”

“So that was a real thing?” Astral blinked.

“More complicated than the story leads you to believe. But yes.” Lucifer smiled, “It’s also incredibly boring and not our focus.” He stood up, “Now, I have one question for you.”

Astral nodded and stood and began to warm up. 

“When you were fighting the daemon knight, why didn’t you give up?” Lucifer asked. 

Astral stopped his warm up and took a deep breath. “I don’t like the book. It’s edited and cut up and butchered. It doesn’t feel right, not all of it. But the parts about laying down your life for another, helping the weak, standing for something of love. I know that’s real, I saw my parents die for that. For me. I can’t just step aside even if something is gonna rip me to pieces, I have to be that shield for them. For anyone.” 

“The book is a pain. The edits strip it of his Word.” Lucifer nodded, “But..” He pointed a cane that materialized in his hand at Astral, “Perhaps that should answer your question. And if it doesn’t, perhaps it is time you asked a new one.” 

Astral blinked, “What?” 

“Why not you?” Lucifer grinned, “Now, block!” He brought the cane forward in a thrust.

Astral reacted and his fists punched it to the side. “The hell?” He felt an energy pass through and around him.

“Block!” Lucifer shouted again, this time the cane was coming down. 

Astral raised his arms and he felt that same energy pass forwards and it felt like an armor over his body. 

“Now, dodge!” Lucifer gave another forward thrust.

Astral barely had time to perceive the attack, but found himself already moving. “Whoa! Stop, what...” 

“The energy of our creator flows through us. It is not something we ask for, for it is always within us.” Lucifer explained, “Our power is His and it was given freely to do our duties. To protect, to teach and to heal. You already know how to fight, the energy, the power, endless potential, it's what makes you one of us.""

“What?” Astral shook his head, “No Half-angel has ever been recorded nearly as fast as I just moved.” 

“Or as powerful?” Lucifer snorted.

Astral paused, he wanted to argue but the image of his father fighting a daemon-lord came surging forward. He roared and punched a metal pole, it snapped in half and he looked down to find his hand bleeding.

“And anger is its own undoing.” Lucifer stepped forward and took his hand, energy cascaded down through him and into Astral’s wound. “In this world you can approach anger in one of three ways; become consumed by it, master yourself over it, or dominate it.” 

“I mean there is a fourth.” Astral smirked, “Use it wisely.” 

“Very few can do that.” Lucifer noted, “Of note I’ve only seen one in recent times. That idiot in America who throws his mind, and head, around like a weapon.” 

Astral snorted, “So what, we don’t get a choice in how to handle it?” 

“Not really, no.” Lucifer admitted, “We must master ourselves over our anger. We cannot dominate it for it is not entirely ours and if we are consumed by it we become the enemy.” 

Astral sighed, “All I have is anger.” 

Lucifer’s cane smashed his skull. 

“OW!” Astral grabbed his head. 

“What did you have when you smashed the jaw of the daemon-knight?” Lucifer asked, his eyes glaring like dying suns, low and intense.

“I...” Astral sighed, “I wasn’t going to let them kill anyone, but I was still angry.”

“Do not confuse anger with wrath or fury.” Lucifer said, “We can wield wrath. We can fuel ourselves in righteous fury. We bathe ourselves in the flames of a holy cause, but the moment we give into the selfish impulse of anger, we lose.” 

Astral looked at the pole and nodded, “That's why you lost. You let it be about you.” 

Lucifer took a step back and nodded, “Perhaps if I had actually been concerned about my kin, perhaps then Father would have listened, but he knew me better than I did. And so my penance continues and if it falls to me to teach the only half-angel that seems to be in the right place at the right time, then so be it”   

“From one set of chains to another.” Astral nodded, he felt his cheek sting before he saw Lucifer’s eyes glaring in rage.

“We are not chained, even as Fallen, I am not chained. I am called.” Lucifer calmed himself. “IF you feel chained, you are free to leave.” 

For several moments Astral stared at the Fallen Angel.

“No.” Astral nodded, “But all I’ve known is chains.” 

Lucifer snorted, “And you follow the one who breaks them. How ironic his Earthly followers forget their purpose.” 

“Not all of them.” Astral snapped, “But the leaders, yeah, definitely.” 

Lucifer’s expression softened and he nodded back, “I apologize, as I clearly demonstrated not even a full angel, Fallen or True, is immune to anger’s venom.” 

“I get it, I’m sorry too.” Astral sighed, “Just made some discoveries last night. Things I should have been paying attention to my whole life. Truths I hid from myself. I’m probably at my lowest right now so...” He shrugged.

“Low points are good.” Lucifer nodded, “It lets you build back up with a better understanding of where you went wrong.” 

Astral smirked, “Fortune cookie mentor sayings?” 

Lucifer laughed, “I think so for that one, actually.” 

Astral bent over laughing and then looked around, “What was this place anyway?” 

Lucifer shrugged, “An old attraction, I don't know. But now it is secluded and away from people.” Lucifer paused, “Speaking of, when your wings are out and engaged with the Light, you can be invisible to most people. Save for those closest to you and those attuned to the world as a whole.” 

“Closest to me?” Astral asked, “What’s that mean?” 

“Lovers, children, family. Even enemies if they know you well enough.” Lucifer explained. “Miss Kanade and Ariane for starters for you.” 

“Ukiko’s a friend. Ariane, I’ll accept.” Astral sighed.

“So forward, using her first name.” Lucifer smirked, “You two are so adorably in denial.” 

“We’ve known each other for less than a week! She’s cute and has a wicked tongue, but I’m not gonna try and just go after her!” Astral snapped. 

“Sharing custody of a child that can’t be housed legally. Working now to free you from the Church.” Lucifer brought up the points as he counted them off on his fingers. “It’s not really your fault, I’ve noticed damaged people tend to gather with other damaged people.” 

“By that argument there should be thousands of us in one spot.” Astral countered and froze as he watched Lucifer grin. 

“What do you call a city, then?” Lucifer roared in laughter, “No one escapes life undamaged. Humans are like puzzle pieces in my understanding. Shaped by their choices and the choices around them, they’ll never fit precisely with another one. But maybe they can find someone they fit with and aren’t miserable with.” 

“You’re a weird teacher.” Astral sighed, “But you’re right. My parents seemed to have that vibe in the videos.” 

“Videos?” Lucifer asked curiously. 

“Journals left for me so I could hear their voices and know what they were like before I was born.” Astral sighed. “You know, let’s focus back on fighting?” 

“Astral.” Lucifer sighed, “Being an angel or a half-angel isn’t just about fighting. To understand the energy and to learn to control it, you must master yourself.” 

Astral stared at the Fallen and the stare turned into a glare.

Lucifer just nodded, “I’m a patient Angel. Whenever you’re ready.” 

“What is this therapy?” Astral snapped. “I’m a fuckup. I can’t use weapons like others, I can barely use a sword. I only know how to fight and notice things.” He roared and screamed and he didn’t stop for a long time. 

When Astral opened his eyes again he was looking at stars and a night sky.

“Ah, you’re done.” Lucifer nodded as he stood back up from laying down on a nearby bench. “I hope that cleared your head.” 

“Not really, I didn’t know I had that in me.” Astral sighed. 

“Every emotion a human has an Angel has and they feel them far more powerfully.” Lucifer advised, “Especially self-doubt, depression, all the things Abaddon wants everyone to feel.” 

“He’s an asshole.” Astral said, “How do you deal with being conflated with him?” 

“Mockery mostly.” Lucifer grinned. “I’ve learned, in my very long life, that the power to say ‘I’m rubber, you’re glue’ has an insanely powerful effect on the Daemon-King.” 

Astral snorted. “This why you said longer?” 

“Yes.” Lucifer nodded, “But also I want you to see the night sky.” 

Astral looked up. The many stars sparkled like jewels.

“Not all of them have worlds with life, but at the very least one has made it here with fleeing souls.” Lucifer explained, “And I can only assume My Lord has accepted them if they desire it, would you die for them?” 

“They’re people, just like anyone else.” Astral said flatly. “Why?” 

“Because I don’t think the angels will.” Lucifer smiled at his student. “Not like you would.” 

“They’d do as ordered.” Astral nodded in understanding. “The Rana know suffering like no human has, really. Their home is gone and they get along with us because we have the same enemy.”  

Lucifer nodded and looked up. “I sometimes wonder if He called them here, beckoned them to hope.” 

Astral nodded, “I can see that.” 

Lucifer nodded, “No, you can’t. But I wish you could. Get some sleep, I’m sure there’s a cot or two around here.” 

Astral looked at his mentor. “Are you fuckin’ serious?” 

“No, I set one up under that tent.” Lucifer grinned and pointed back to a tent. “Your coat is about the best blanket, but there were a few stuffed animals you can use as pillows.” 

Astral went to move and finally collapsed onto his knees.

“Screaming at the sky for hours does that.” Lucifer said as he helped Astral up. “Those will hurt in the morning.” 

“Hurting now, you old fuck.” Astral grumbled.

Lucifer bellowed with laughter once again.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

In her office Ukiko Kanade was busy filing documents with different countries and their various Charter Organizations. She was sipping coffee well past midnight and struggling to get her emails in order. Ariane had been asleep for hours and she was glad for that, but now she was stuck waiting and it was grating her nerves. 

A knock came at her door and she checked the hall camera on her apartment apps. She glared in anger. But got up and opened the door. 

“Daughter.” Her father, Kenzō Kaneda, stood in front of her. “I hear you are working with the new hero.” 

“Yes.” Ukiko said flatly as she glared up at the imposing figure of her father, she looked down the hall to see his guards at the elevator.

“He is not in the city.” Her father said, “He left with another of his kind earlier today.” 

“Yes.” Ukiko answered flatly again.

“Damnit, child, I’m making sure you’re okay.” Kenzō hissed, “I know you hate me, but I care.” 


Ukiko took a breath. “I am fine. Astral is learning new things.” 

Kenzō nodded, “He seems strong, capable.” 

Ukiko’s eyes flared with anger, “He is a client.” 

Kenzō smirked, “And you’re up past midnight for just a client?” He chuckled and nodded, “Very well, you are safe, and...” He paused and looked past her.

Ukiko looked to see Ariane walking out of the hall in her nightgown. 

“Miss Ukiko, he’s loud.” Ariane yawned.

“I’m whispering.” Kenzō blinked.

“Your whisper is a lion’s roar.” Ukiko rolled her eyes, “He was just leaving.” 

“When did you take in a child?” Kenzō asked.

“Don’t worry.” Ukiko snapped, “She’s not your blood so you have no reason to stay.” 

Kenzō Kanade was not a man to show much emotion, but his immediate reaction was a sad nod as he turned to leave. “Take care, daughter.” 

Ukiko closed the door and tried to center herself. She ended up screaming at the door for a few minutes. She stopped when Ariane grabbed her legs.

“You’re both so sad. He just wanted to make sure you were safe.” Ariane buried her face into Ukiko’s leg. 

“I know.” Ukiko sighed and picked the girl up, “But adults can’t always get along. Even if we’re family. My father did things I can never agree with, and he knows this. I know he cares, but I do not want him around if he cannot leave those actions behind him.”

Ariane nodded, “I bet Astral’s fighting under the moonlight like Lunalia!” 

“Or he’s sleeping on a tree because L, Dr. Mourning is a mean teacher.” Ukiko smirked and yawned. “I think I need sleep too. Go get back to bed, I’ll be getting into mine soon.” 

Thunder crashed outside.

“Afraid of thunder?” Ukiko asked.

Ariane giggled and shook her head. “Can I sleep with you though?” 

Ukiko smiled and bumped her forehead to Ariane’s, “Yes. Go get teddy and I’ll get dressed.” 

Ariane smiled as she was let down and grabbed her stuffed friend.

Ukiko got into her pajamas and slipped into her bed with Ariane next to her. The small child was warm, but even she could feel the low and slow “heartbeat” she had. It wasn’t distressing, oddly enough and helped her get to sleep.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral woke up and walked out of the leaky tent to see Lucifer drying himself in the sun. It reminded him of some incredibly old hair shampoo commercials from his youth as the Fallen angel had to toss his long curls back every time he tried to get one section dry.

“Maybe you’re born with it?” Astral joked.

Lucifer looked up, “Yes I am and I will not mistreat my wonderful locks any time of the year. They are precious.” 

“Do you kill jokes for fun, or sport?” Astral rolled his eyes. 

“I let the good ones live.” Lucifer stood and shook his hand free of fire that had encased it.

“Today is more introspection.” Lucifer smiled.

“Really?” Astral sighed.

“No.” Lucifer flung his cane at Astral and it crashed into Astral’s skull.  

Astral fell backwards and groaned. “I hate you.” 

“You were supposed to dodge it.” Lucifer snickered. “Today we’re going to learn how one keeps the energy flowing without wings.” 

Astral slowly got to his feet. “I haven’t even mastered getting my wings out!” 

“Exactly, and I can’t be present all of the time.” Lucifer said, “So these two basic techniques and mastering yourself are your goals as a student.” 

“And if I can’t control my anger?” Astral asked.

“You can.” Lucifer said, “You have to want it though.” 

Astral sighed, once again he felt defeated by everything up until this point. “We’re rejected by Angels, used by humans. What’s the point?”

“Do you want me to fly back and borrow young Ariane?” Lucifer snarled, “The point? The point is you have the power to defend. The power to heal. The power to fight back. Your human half had that figured out last century in a comic book!” 

Astral looked at the Fallen and shook his head, “I don’t know...” 

Lucifer walked up and put his three central fingers on Astral’s forehead. “I was a messenger once, I will be one again, if I must.” 

Astral shook as a vision of darkness engulfed the Earth. It was like nothing he had felt before, and all consuming hunger. Evil, unrelenting in its desire to end life. He didn’t know what it was, but at the same time he knew in his heart what he was seeing. 

“They’re coming back!” Astral peeled away from Lucifer.

“Yes.” Lucifer said.

Astral stood, shocked and unsure how to process what he had seen. “We don’t have the numbers!” 

“Then we need power and skill.” Lucifer said, “You are the only one of our kin capable to fight on our Lord’s behalf. The rest are either unwilling or unable. So now, will you lie down and die or will you stand to give others the chance to live?” 

“And what about you?” Astral asked.

Lucifer’s sword turned to a flaming blade, “I will die for this mudball and the monkeys you call kin. I will end as many as I can before I am extinguished and I will drag more to hell with me when I do.”

Astral locked eyes with the Fallen and saw not dying suns in his glare, but a flaring sun, unwilling to just yet fade. Astral nodded and took a breath. 

“I don’t know if I can master my anger, it’s been a part of me since I was young. But I can put it aside to put myself before those I care about.” Astral looked up, “Show me.” 

Lucifer smiled, his student was beginning to understand and that meant hope existed.

Smoggy: So if you missed my comment on the last chapter, I’m hiding Sci-Fi quotes from old shows and books. Fantasy Quotes too. If you find them mentrion them, I love to share my fandoms and find those also involved with them.  I’ll reveal all my intentional quotes in the last Chapter via a comment.

Wraith: You got bored writing this didn’t you?

Astral: Jerk.

Smoggy: Quite the opposite, I had fun and mixing in the quotes made it more fun.

Perfection: Hey Smoggy... (tapping Smoggy’s shoulder) You forget to feed something?

Smoggy: Patch 8 isn’t out so BG 3 isn’t in full addiction mode. RDR 2 is quelled. TMNT is a MP whenever game. I can’t really think of... oh no.

Wraith: Mutants an Masterminds?

Smoggy: I kinda don’t have the dialogue ready I needed for next game and that’s today!.

Perfection: That’s it? We can ad lib.

Smoggy: I don’t think...

Perfection: (finger to Smoggy’s lips) Shuuush, Papa Perfection has this handled, we’ll get something going. Now who are we talking for?

Smoggy: Elbee.

Perfection: Emo, edgy... 

Wraith: Actually this Elbee is fairly calm and rather subdued. That won’t affect mine, will it?

Smoggy: No. Yours will always be jackass number 2.

Perfection: Who’s number 1.

Smoggy: (stares at Perfection)

Perfection: Who? ... Oh...

1ielmbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1ielmbo/sad_new_resident_to_belltown/,Sad New Resident To Belltown,"Me and my girlfriend recently relocated to Seattle from LA and after initial excitement and optimism we are both quickly regretting the decision to move to Belltown due to the homeless population and open drug use. We picked out Belltown due to the proximity to restaurants, venues and being near our work locations. We were well aware and scouted out the area ahead of time but between my walk to work and her walking around for coffee in the morning, the amount of open drug use and erratic characters is shocking. And it's not just the homeless which we were very used to in LA but their behavior which is a lot more brazen and erratic. 

  
It's sad that it's been such a short time and my GF is already too scared to walk to workout classes in the morning or evening and scared to go in certain directions to try and find new spots. I don't know if there are any glimmers of hope to look forward in part from the city but frankly it's stoking the worst sort of reactions in me towards these people and this city which I had moved to with so much optimism. 



How is it that such an optimal and pretty location has been sacrificed to drug use and homeless people. What went wrong and what are people doing to fix this? ",0,1738348183.0,Seattle,74,0.14,False

Falor was acting strangely. Quistis had been around him for long enough to understand the subtle changes in his demeanour. Every time their two new companions drew near, he became suddenly sterner, wary as if on edge. Sparks danced in his hair and the air crackled when he moved.

All of it worried her.

She hadn’t had a chance to warn Mertle and her friend about the danger of touching Falor. There simply hadn’t been time to take it into consideration. How could she have known she’d run into them out in the armpits of nowhere? It made her blood boil.

“You bit your lip, Quis,” Falor said from across the meagre camp fire. “I think you need to get that incisor filed down.”

She wiped her thumb over her lower lip and winced at the pain there. Blood coated her finger. She wouldn’t waste a prayer for something that small.

“Sorry. Was thinking of something.”

“Oh?”

He could ask a single syllable and imply *everything* by it. Now she had his attention. It wasn’t a light thing to bear on the best of days. Her shock at meeting Mertle in the bloody forest had been easy enough to conceal over the rush of saving the elendine from a gold-tongue. Now, the unease of having the two so close and Falor so thoughtful was getting hard to keep from him.

*He knows me entirely too well.*

“Those outlaws we’ve heard about,” she said carefully, picking at the words. “I don’t remember there being quite so many reports when we first came to Valen. Do you?”

Falor bit into his piece of jerky and chewed slowly. Nightfall was still chilly and the forest was dense enough that it trapped the moisture of the day. There was a wet cold in the air that the fire turned into a cloying steam. It was unbearable.

Barlo snored nearby, sounding like a lumberjack’s saw. Vial was at his back, huddled under his sleeping bag on the cold, wet earth. For him, this was *pleasant enough*.

Mertle and Tummy sat together some distance from the flames, talking in low voices. Quistis could catch snippets of conversation. They were to do with summertime plans over their shop, ways to expand the business and who on the Agora’s council they’d need to butter up to accept them taking over the back alley space. They were flawlessly playing up their cover roles.

“I don’t think we’ve had much banditry in the area, actually.”

She squeaked when Falor spoke, drawn out of her own head by his voice. She got a raised eyebrow but no comment.

“After those two raids in the first summer I remember reports going down to near nothing for a couple of cycles. There was that large camp near Bastra that I went and flattened. After that…” He scrunched up his face, focusing inward. “No, nothing for the past two cycles. Been mostly quiet, aside from the abduction issues. Since I hung those bastards, even those have stopped.”

“Yes, Lucian got quite happy at that,” Quistis muttered, letting her annoyance come to the fore to conceal other worries. “Do you know he tried take credit for quelling the issue? Advertised how he provided valuable intel for the Storm Guard that led to making the roads much safer for everyone. The Guild hall had a poster with this. Heard he spent a small fortune on it.”

That got a low chuckle out of Falor. “In the strictest sense, he’s absolutely right. His intel led to the ratmen. That led to the Vitalis.” And that led to Cinder, but he didn’t add that part. “Now that you mention it, it is rather strange we’re getting an uptick in banditry round these parts. Wonder if they figured we’d move away because I dealt with Cinder.”

She took a sip of her tea. “Could be.”

And it was true. They’d made no secret of their mission in Valen. So a reemergence from Tallah Amni had meant their mission was complete. They’d been assigned to *limit the damage* the sorceress could inflict if she showed up again.

Falor had done precisely that. Even if he hadn’t killed the sorceress, they’d accomplished what the Empress had promised Valen’s council. She’d pulled them out afterwards mostly to chagrin the likes of Diogron.

Now, Valen’s council would need to police their territories on their own. It wouldn’t be long until they knocked on the Empire’s door asking for support.

“We could leave them alone,” she ventured. “I think the Empress would actually prefer that.”

“Mother would prefer I were in Aztroa right now.” There was a boyish grin on his face which made her uncomfortable. “I aim to disappoint for once. These men praying on the local villages are becoming dangerous. Mother can play her political games in other fashions. I won’t stand for innocent people left to suffer just so a border can be shifted by a few leagues.”

Quistis became aware of a gaze on the back of her head. She turned and startled at Mertle being right behind her, looking down. “May I sit?” the elendine asked.

“Uh… certainly.” Quistis scooted aside on her own blanket and made room. “Haven’t heard you get close.”

Falor’s gaze had hardened a fraction. There it was again, a guarded look in his eyes. He suspected something about Mertle… but what?

The elendine sat demurely and offered Quistis some sort of meat stick. It smelled viciously of spices. She accepted the offering and Mertle leaned over the fire to offer one to Falor as well.

“There’s a merchant in Valen that makes elend *cuisine*,” Mertle said. “He doesn’t always get it right, but his *giudems* are pretty close to the real thing. The meat’s wrong—we don’t use beef—but the flavour’s almost like home.” She grinned. “I’m told it has a kick for humans.”

The warning came a touch too late for Falor. He’d bitten into the thing. Whatever taste it had, the effect was immediate: his face turned bright crimson. With as much dignity as he could salvage, he cast about in barely concealed panic.

Quistis offered him her water canteen.

It would’ve been rude not to taste. She made a face and gingerly took a bite.

*Well, that was a bloody mistake,* she thought some time later as she wondered if she should drink an accelerant or invoke the Goddess’s help. She doubted she’d ever taste anything ever again.

“Sorry,” Mertle said after both of them were done coughing and emptying the canteen. “I didn’t realise you don’t eat spicy food in Aztroa.”

“Lady Mergara…” Falor wheezed. “There is spice in Aztroa.” His voice was hoarse. Quistis resented that he’d drank her entire canteen. “What manner of poison makes a spice like this?” He waved the *giudem.* “I could swallow red coal from the fire and it would be less painful.”

Mertle chewed on her own portion and looked at it quite serenely. “Really? It’s quite mild, I think.”

Quistis and Falor met each other’s eye and shrugged. “Elends,” they said in a voice.

“I overheard you talking bandits,” Mertle said, playing up the airhead persona.

Quistis had seen how the girl talked and looked when out of this skin. When they’d cornered her at the Sisters, she could’ve sword the elendine was ready to kill them all in cold blood, and had the confidence that she’d manage. Maybe that wasn’t far from the truth.

“I thought banditry was punished by death,” Mertle went on. “Don’t adventurers kill on sight anyone with a bounty?”

“They’re not allowed to kill on sight. That would still be murder,” Falor answered. “Any human killing must be sanctioned by the Guild.”

Mertle’s eyebrows rose. “Only *human* killing?”

“Empress Catharina has a wide definition of what it means to be *human*,” Falor said. “While within the Empire, any of the seven are afforded the same protection and rights. To stands with us is to be one of us. Yes, even the aelir.”

That was one of the oldest saying of the empire, as far as Quistis knew. Ever since Aztroa had been taken by the empress, and the gates of the realm opened to those seeking to escape the Dominion, the saying had become a statement of fact on Vas. Few places rejected this and openly criticised the empress’s edict. They weren’t worth talking about.

“And are you *sanctioned*?” Mertle went on, a particularly mean-spirited edge in her voice.

*Why are you needling him?* Cold sweat dripped down Quistis’s back as her gaze swivelled between the two.

“I sign the sanctions,” Falor replied without any rancour.

“Judge and executioner? Wow. You wield so much power!”

“Is this going somewhere, lady Mergara?”

“Curiosity, Commander Falor. In the Dominion, those that resorted to banditry were often the destitute and shunned. The aelir would cull them if they ever became too much of a burden.”

“We are not the aelir,” Quistis said. “We do not *cull.*”

“Don’t you? Are you going to take prisoners here? March them through the forest, feed them, care for them until you get them to a prison so they may speak of their crimes?”

“That is hardly—”

“Fair?” Mertle asked. Nothing of her expression changed even minutely, but the tone of voice was chilling. “You’re about to sic a demigod—no offence, Your Majesty—on what are probably some farmers reeling from a bad winter. How is that fair?”

Falor sighed and took another bite of the impossible sausage. He managed to chew it without blood spurting from his nose.

“That is true, lady—”

“Mertle,” Mertle said. “Only Mertle, please.”

Falor nodded, “Mertle, then. What you say is true, of course. There are few men out there who choose the life of a criminal out of moral decay. Yes, it has been a hard winter in many a place. But it’s been like so for everyone.” He took another bite of the vile thing and managed to swallow it without hiccups. “I can’t take prisoners while I’m on my own mission. I can’t ignore the victims. I’m at a crossroads. Do nothing, and I am complicit in their crimes. Kill them all, and I am a murderer.”

“Our aim is not to kill indiscriminately, Mertle,” Quistis said, surprised somewhat by Falor’s openness. “Long experience dictates that these groups rarely survive a decisive strike from authority. A single strike against wherever they’ve fortified their presence is generally sufficient to scatter them.”

“And scattered men are easier dealt with by the local communities,” Falor said. “I may be judge and executioner, as you said, but I am not a monster.”

“Yet you speak like one, Commander Falor.” Mertle didn’t look to be giving up on her protest. “You choose to kill because anything else would inconvenience you.”

“It’s true, yes. That is the path of least resistance with the best chance of a positive overall outcome.”

The smith approached. Quistis had less of an understanding of the man than she did of Mertle, and it seemed now that was poor reference. She hadn’t expected the elendine to be such a vehement critic of their methods.

“Leave them to their work, Mertle,” the smith said, squatting by the fire to place a hand on the elendine’s shoulder. “It’s not our place to speak.”

“But they’ll kill—”

“Not our place,” he repeated. “Come. We should rest for the night.”

Falor hadn’t moved from his place and watched the exchange with interest. “What would you do, smith Tummy? If you were faced with this responsibility?”

The smith rumbled and shared a look with Mertle. “Form a militia from local communities. Teach them to defend themselves. Elect one to represent the Guard and speak with its authority.”

“That takes time I do not have. And, often, those efforts fail.” Falor continued eating and Mertle offered him another stick. “Give responsibility to unprepared men, and they will squander it. Or, worse, abuse it. If my action raises a tyrant over a community, they will resent me.”

He shrugged and looked to Quistis. She understood immediately of what he spoke. It had been a particularly unpleasant intervention into Valen’s countryside, some seasons prior. He’d been in a black mood all winter after what he’d needed to do there.

“It could happen that the next time I pass through, I would be faced with an even worse choice. I will either need to do terrible things to depose an unjust ruler, or be met with pitchforks. And again need to do immoral things to reestablish the Empire’s peace.” He spread his hands. “My morality suffers whichever way I choose to lean.”

*It’s just bandits,* Quistis thought glumly. In the empire there was never a shortage of thieves and murderers, especially in those places where Aztroa’s reach grew weaker and thinner. Men preyed on those weaker than themselves. It would be no big loss to anyone if they were stopped.

But, then again, it had been that sort of necessity-first thinking that had pushed Dreea down her path. They were supposed to be better than this, better than to plan bloody massacres in the night, out outside the normal reach of law, with overwhelming force. If they were no better, then why were they there?

“Do you have a suggestion, Mertle?” Falor asked.

He sat still as a statue, elbows on his knees, his chin held in the net of his fingers. He had the look in his eyes that generally promised a lot of paperwork for Quistis. Something had his undivided attention and she couldn’t shake the feeling it wasn’t Mertle’s protestations.

Mertle didn’t answer, though the look on her face showed she was turning the words over.

Falor’s smile grew crooked.

“As is often the case, protesting only goes as far as pointing out the problem. It almost never offers a solution. Talk is cheap, Mertle. Making the decision and following it up… well, that’s a tad more difficult.”

She wasn’t ready to go down without a fight. “Become their leader then. Challenge whoever leads them and—”

“And flatten into a bloody smear whoever leads them now. Same tactic, just one victim. One or ten or a hundred, it’s still a bloody outcome.”

“There must be a better way than to simply act like the ae… like animals. I thought humans were civilised.”

“Civility must have a limit.” Falor raised a hand to forestall any more protestations. “I will give them a chance to draw back, break their camps, and scatter. I will not kill fleeing men. But that is all the concession I am willing to make.”

Before Mertle had a chance to digest this, he went on, “But why is this a concern of yours, Mertle? Of course, indiscriminate killing is wrong and should be abhorred. But this is justice to be met out. Why are you so determined to get in its way?”

“Because we’ve starved before,” the elendine answered, voice almost too small to hear. If it was true or an act, Quistis had no idea, but the tone was raw enough to believe. “We’ve been on the wrong end of culls before. We’ve been branded for being hungry and poor and lost.” She rolled her sleeve up and showed a strange scar on her left arm. It was a circle sectioned into two uneven pieces. A burned scar. “Sometimes the hunger is stronger than morals. I’m not proud of what I did to live, but not ashamed that I survived. Punishment for surviving shouldn’t be death.”

“I see.” And he probably did, as he’d spent some time in Nen in his earlier years. It was well-known. “While I understand your feelings, you must also understand that I will do what is within my power to help the innocents. If that blood on my hands is of the desperate, then so be it.”

“Can I go ahead and talk to the first villagers we meet?” Mertle asked. “Maybe with Captain Quistis accompanying me? Maybe we can learn something that’s not immediately obvious. Maybe even learn of a way to preserve more lives? If winter has been lean here, then there will be work in thaw. If there’s work, hands are needed.”

Falor leaned back, ate the sausage to the end, and hiccuped. He pressed knuckles to his mouth and squinted, tears streaking down his cheek. “Why is it hotter at the end?”

“You’re supposed to eat that end first,” Tummy said. “Don’t worry. No permanent damage.”

To Mertle, Falor said between hiccups, “If that will ease your mind, certainly. You do not need to be a part of this. I haven’t recruited you to a cause. There is no obligation.”

“It is a moral obligation, Commander Falor.”

He said nothing more but looked to Quistis. She read the question in his eyes and answered with a nod. “It’s worth a try. It’s odd to have banditry at all in this time of the cycle. Getting more information before we commit to a pig chase around the forest can’t be a bad thing.”

Barlo snored himself awake so loudly that he startled all of them. He mumbled and grumbled, then titanically turned over on his other side, facing them.

“He is very loud,” Mertle stage-whispered in to them all, and grinned. “When I first saw him I was certain he was an aelir’darst raider.”

“Never say that to his face,” Falor said softly.

“I heard it. May piss in yer coffee. Tomorrow—” Barlo mumbled without opening his eyes. He turned over again, sighed, and resumed snoring.

“Ew.” Mertle scrunched up her nose, yawned, stretched. She rose and looked at Falor for a while longer. “I… thank you, Commander.”

“I haven’t honestly done anything.”

“You’ve listened. We may not agree, but you still listened.” She did a gesture that Quistis didn’t understand. Index and middle finger to her lips, then forehead, and finally the centre of her chest. “Good night,” she called before both she and Tummy headed for their bedrolls.

“What does that mean?” Quistis whispered when they were out of earshot.

“I thank you for the words you’ve gifted. I will think long on them,” Falor answered. “It’s a sign of respect.”

“An odd culture.” She’d been around elends for a long time, but they mostly acted like humans did. She rarely saw any of them display any of their own ways of expressing themselves.

“It’s not odd. It’s survivalist. Some aelir households whip their elend servants if they speak in their presence.”

“Some?”

“Too many. The less said about what else they do, the better.”

That shed some light on the conversation, now that she thought of it. What had Mertle been doing actually? The elendine acted offended and acted like a fool, but she was neither. Of that, at least, Quistis was certain. So what had all this been about?

*I must be going daft,* she admonished herself when realisation dawned: Mertle had gotten her separated from the rest of the group.

Quistis had been too frightened of dropping her guard that she’d become stupid. It took an effort of will not to let her jaw drop.

The elendine had secured a moment for the two of them to talk. And she could be certain Deidra wasn’t far away either. This should have been Quistis’s job to achieve, not Mertle’s.

*Who are you?* She had wondered on this before. Who was this elendine? And how had she become her sister’s lover? Dreea had a particular taste in women, and Mertle was nothing like any of those that had come before. For one thing, she had a wonderfully bright head on her shoulders.

“You’ve drawn in,” Falor noted. “May I?” He reached for the giudem she still hung on to.

Quistis stared at his outstretched hand without understanding for a time. Then she caught herself and handed over the horrid thing.

“Don’t tell me you like these,” she said, aghast at the prospect.

He shrugged and bit into it. “Once you get past the pain, it’s quite tasty.”

“Once your taste buds die off, you mean.” She shuddered. “It shouldn’t be legal to produce that.”

“You’re being insensitive.”

“I’m preserving my taste capacity.”

“Quis.”

“Fine, fine. You know I don’t do well with anything rougher than pepper.”

He smiled and reached over, pressing his hand over hers.

“Something’s on your mind,” he said. “And it’s not bandits.”

To her choked protest, he went on. “In your own time, Quis. I know you don’t approve of this pig chase around the forest, but I promise it’s important.”

She could only smile at his concern and nod.

1ielk5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1ielk5l/how_i_fixed_a_decade_of_severe_insomnia/,How I fixed a decade of severe insomnia,"I recently posted this to the r /insomnia sub and was blown away how many people would rather take a med than try to change their habits but this sub seems different so here goes. I know it's stupid long but fixing insomnia is a long process. So if you're really struggling, please read it and let me know your thoughts in the comments.

I've had terrible insomnia for at least a decade (I'm in my 30s now), and about a year ago I finally fixed it and now fall asleep within 15 minutes and sleep an average 8 hours per night. I no longer take ADHD meds either because it turns out that insomnia and anxiety were the cause of most my problems.

In the past, I would regularly lie awake until 2am. I would drink 4-5 cups of coffee every day to get by, and generally live in a state of fogginess. I remember constantly wishing I was dead, because then I could finally get some good rest. Here are three things that I had to address to fix my sleep:

1. Life anxiety
2. Sleep anxiety
3. Sleep hygiene

I used to live in a constant state of stress and anxiety. I was always feeling anxious about every occasion and event, even when there was no reason to be. One evening I stumbled upon the book “Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving” by Pete Walker and it changed absolutely everything.

Long story short, I came to realize that my shitty upbringing had a bigger effect on me than I realized. I realized that I never spoke my mind, understood my feelings, and was always trying to be a perfectionist to avoid criticism. My fear of being criticized was killing me, and it all finally made sense. I then spent the next few months absorbing every book on psychology (small list at the end) that I could and learned a few important things.

The most important thing I learned about is called classical conditioning. I, like most people on planet earth, had heard about Pavlov’s dog, but I didn’t truly understand it. In the end, we are all Pavlov’s dog, constantly being conditioned by our environment. Some of us grew up in shitty homes that require more work than others to recondition. But the brain is an amazing organ that is always rewiring itself.

Here is what I learned. Your brain is always making predictions about the future, based on past experiences, and releases hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline just **before** it believes you will need them. This process is called Allostasis. That's why I would always get an adrenaline rush in the evening, long before laying down in bed.

Chronic sleeping problems may begin after stressful life events keep you awake for several weeks. After the stressful event is over though, your brain becomes trained to stay awake and will release cortisol right before bed, assuming you will need it.

This is what scientist Ivan Pavlov discovered in 1909 with his famous dog experiment that we call Pavlovian conditioning, or Classical Conditioning. It’s something all animals, including humans, always do.

Let's say you have a dog. Every time you feed him, you ring a bell. Over time, your dog will associate the sound of the bell with getting food. So even if he's not hungry, when he hears the bell, he'll start to drool because the body will begin preparing to eat, even without seeing any food. This is because you've trained your dog through conditioning. By ringing the bell every time he is fed, you've linked these two things together in his mind. Your dog has learned that the sound of the bell predicts food.

Conditioned events can be unlearned as well. To make the dog stop salivating when hearing a bell, we need to break the association between the bell and food. To do this, we can ring the bell and not bring any food. With enough repetitions, the dogs brain will predict there is no food after a bell and will not salivate after the bell is rung.

Sleep can be fixed in a similar way. You just need a way to instantly fall asleep when you lay down in bed so you begin to associate the bed with good sleep. How can you make someone fall asleep right away? By sleep depriving them. People will always fall asleep if they are tired enough. You can use sleep restriction to make someone become so tired that no amount of anxiety will keep them awake. Do this enough times and Pavlovian conditioning will fix insomnia. The body will stop releasing cortisol right before bed.

This is what happens during Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Along with sleep restriction, CBT-I will also teach you to reduce stress and anxiety, thus lowering your stress levels in life and before bed, and preventing future sleep problems. Remember, sleep hygiene prevents chronic insomnia, while CBT-I treats it. Insomnia **cannot** be treated with sleep hygiene alone.

Unfortunately I couldn’t find a CBT-I therapist in my town that took my insurance, so I fixed it with an app. First I bought an Apple Watch. Then I signed up for the **Stellar Sleep** app. The app monitored the sleep data from the watch and adjusted the sleep restriction training based on that data. It was also great for learning to journal, do breathing exercises, relax, and be more mindful. It took 3 months and **I was cured**. Sleep restriction therapy works. Yes it sucks for 1-2 months, but it won't give you dementia like meds will.

Sleep hygiene is critical to prevent insomnia (but only after CBT-I fixes it). Therefore I’ve cut back to 1 cup of coffee in the morning which has been the most important step (I used to drink 4-5 cups, later in the day). I also don't work late any more and spend time winding down every evening (controlling cortisol is very important).

But most importantly, I am also much much much more mindful of everything and pay much more attention to my behaviors, feelings, and that of others. I'll often ask myself why I feel a certain way, and realize that my feeling are not always accurate. Sometimes they're the result of my upbringing and conditioning. I view everything through the lens of Pavlov. If something is stressing me out, it means I need to be more exposed to it. The brain will adapt to anything, but it's my job to condition it.

**My recommendation for you:** Buy a smart watch and sign up for Stellar Sleep RIGHT NOW and just do the sleep restriction. Just do exactly what the little owl in the app tells you to do, you won't regret it. Don't worry about the books and all that now. Read them after you've started the program. They make for great reading in the evening instead of the video games, or social media, or other cortisol-inducing habits that are slowly killing you. Yes you will be better of going to a real CBT-I therapist, but that's usually such a hurdle that most people don't do it, so just get the app.

**Some books that really helped me:**

1. Complex PTSD by Pete Walker
2. Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman
3. How Emotions are Made by Lisa Feldman Barret
4. What is Health? By Peter Sterling
5. Zebras Don't Get Ulcers by Robert Sapolsky

And no I don't work for Stellar Sleep. I'm just a very happy customer. Feel free to use any of the other CBT-I apps or therapists out there. I just didn't want to spend the $2k for a therapist so I found the app on Google. I think they have a lot more competitors now, but I do know theirs worked well for me. I would imagine a good CBT-I therapist to be the holy grail as they can address anxiety issues as well, so of course go to a professional if you can afford it.

Stellar Sleep doesn't require a smart watch, but it does integrate with one if you have it which I really liked. Without the watch you just fill out a daily questionnaire about your sleep but I found that sleep logs are difficult to keep because I usually have no idea when I fell asleep.

If you can't afford any of this, there's a good guide on the Stanford Health Website titled ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia"". But be careful, CBT-I is a structed program and will tell you what to do. The guide is nice, but you need someone to tell you exactly what to do every day. So I think it's better to do a structured CBT-I program.

It's been more than three months since I first became ill and have a lot of symptoms. I'm just really hoping this finds the right person who has experienced something like this or any advice because I want my life back to normal.

Summary:

1. Medications Past: Cirpo 14 days finished on January 1 2025, wegovy (stopped after food poisoning in november 2024 and was on it for 3 weeks), sprionolactone for acne 50 mg which I have taken for years without issue, diflucan for a yeast infection after the Cipro.
2. Current Medications: Famotidine 40mg, prilosec 20 mg before dinner, zyrtec once a day, sprinolactone once a day for acne, probiotics, fiber supplements, started taking an iron and b12 supplement since my iron levels were low and I was feeling dizzy.
3. Current symptoms: burning/stinging in stomach and abdomen, all over I feel a burning/stinging sensation in my arms, back. In my feet, face, legs and pelvis I feel these small electric type shock feelings. Exhausted, trouble sleeping at night due to burning sensation in stomach and back. I was having bad headaches and saw an acupuncturist which did help with that and my low back pain. I feel like a burning sensation in my ears but exam was normal, I also have no rash of any sort on my body. Soreness in my pelvic region and an odd smell not bad but just different from normal but no weird discharge. My lymph nodes in my right arm pit and pelvic are swollen and sometimes painful. Random ulcers in my mouth since finishing cipro that come and go. Sometimes night sweats/chills.
4. Tests: 3 CT scans all normal, Xray normal, blood work showed high WBC and monocytes, urine in the past showed trace amounts of blood and bacteria but urine cultures negative and I've had two urine tests since finishing cipro and its normal now. Blood sugar normal. Full STD panel all negative, BV negative, yeast infection negative. Pelvic exam was normal. Iron levels low (10 below what is considered ""normal"" low). Kidney and liver function normal. I had an endoscopy a few weeks ago which came back negative for hpylori and celiac (celiac runs in my family), but showed I had some gastritis. I saw a urologist and a cystoscopy which was normal. Food allergy and enviro allergy test showed no food allergies but allergy to pollen, mold, dogs. Waiting for GI to send me a breath test for SIBO and I have another ultrasound of my pelvis in a few weeks. Dr ordered a mammogram of my armpit/breast.
5. Eating habits: have cut out coffee, citrus, pasta, bread (anything with gluten) because I noticed my stomach pain was worse when I had that, tomatoes, red meat and fibrous veggies because I found those were too hard to digest...as well as spicy food, chocolate and sweets. I basically just eat eggs, chicken and rice now lol with the occasional cauliflower pasta.

The full story: 1 week before thanksgiving 2024 I got food poisoning. I had been on wegovy on and off for over a year and recently started taking it again a few weeks before food poisoning. I got the food poisoning at a friendsgiving pot luck and threw up only once and had diarrhea and for the week after my stomach felt OFF. I stopped taking the Wegovy and have not taken it since. Usually I can eat whatever I want and have a stomach of steel but this time I could sense something wasn't right I just had this awful burning pain and empty feeling whenever I ate no matter what I ate. Then on Thanksgiving I got a cold. I went to urgent care to try to find out if I had strep/flu and the nurse sent me directly to the ER because she thought I might have pancreatitis based on symptoms. Went to the ER, they ran bunch of tests (CT, blood work, urine) all came back normal except my WBC and monocytes were high and urine had trace amounts of blood and bacteria. They didn't think any of this was serious and sent me home with pepcid for my stomach. I get over the cold (tested negative for covid/strep/flu), but the stomach pain still persisted and was getting worse to the point I couldnt sleep at night and was having a thumping feeling in my back on the right side. I was also having INTENSE pelvic pain no cramping but it felt sore down there and like a lot of pressure especially on my right side. I have a history of + HPV tests and had to get a colposcopy despite feeling not great I have had them before so I wasn't that worried (this is Dec 10 now) after that colposcopy I had the WORST pain I have ever imagined in my whole life. It was like a shooting electric shock pain it felt like in my bladder/clitoris to the point where I couldn't stand or walk. Mind you I had a leep two years ago and the pain was minimal and I was fine so I have a decent understanding of pain/procedures. I went to the ER again, WBC was higher than before and same urine results, but CT and Xray and ultrasound of my pelvic was normal. I went to see my regular PCP and she thought I might have a kidney infection despite having normal kidney function and gave me the antibiotic cipro. The cipro actually did help with the bloating and gastro pain I was feeling but the burning/sharp pain in my pelvic region did not go away until about day 10 out of 14 of being on cipro. I was also having blood in my urine but the cultures came back negative. I usually see my doctor once a year on my physical so she knew all these ER visits are unlike me and I am generally healthy. Since finishing the cipro antibiotics I also took **fluconazole** for a yeast infection only one pill a few days after I finished the cipro and I had this horrible burning / tingling sensation all over my body that last for days it felt like an allergic reaction and the only thing that seemed to make it better was an allergy pill. I've still been having burning pain in my stomach, swelling, bloating since finishing all these antibiotics and now I feel burning sensation all over my body like pins and needles and like a light electric shock. I had an endoscopy a few weeks ago which showed I was negative for celiac (it runs in my family), negative for hpylori, but I did have gastritis he said it was mild though and likely the cause of my pain was SIBO and now I have to wait 3 weeks to get my breath test.",1,1738347989.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

My wife has always wanted me to be more affectionate and wanted more sex (I know I am lucky!) About ten years ago she had what she called an emotional affair (I am pretty sure it went beyond emotional, but honestly that line matters less to me than the emotional boundaries). Recently, I have been really working to give her the affection and sex at the level she has always wanted/desired. Randomly, I decided to look on her computer to see if she ever searched for anything sex related so I have a better sense of what she may be into. At first, I did find a few small hints in her search history, but nothing earth shattering. But, I also found in her search history that she has been searching online for the guy she had an affair with. Not one time, but several different days/weeks, she seems to have searched for his general info (looking at old myspace pages, Poshmark page, and things like this but they all seem to reveal not much/not be active) as well as a few of his relatives and even looking at Zillow on the house I think he lives in (I think he still lives with his mom). Before everyone freaks out saying I violated her privacy, she has ALWAYS made it clear sharing her passwords for her phone and laptop telling me she wants me to know I can look on them at any time. The thing is I think she is REALLY happy right now, and we seem to be doing great other than what I found in her search history. Could it be that me finally being more affectionate as she requested 10 years ago sparked guilt? or wanting closure with this guy? I should add that economically and culturally/educationally, my wife and I are in a MUCH better spot than this guy, so I don't think he has anything to offer her other than she could ""save"" him or be more of the partner in a position of power. I also read one comment online saying if a SO is searching for someone, you know they have no contact with that person (which is a good thing), but I can't help but wanting to know WTF why after 10 years is she searching for this guy? Also, I think this confirms she did go beyond emotions with him, I can't imagine some texts from 10 years ago and a few coffee dates being deep enough emotionally that TEN years later you need closure or what to know what he is up to in life. Am I over reacting? Should I call her out? Once I call her out, she will realize I can see her searches and might just prevent me from seeing future insights and/or I really don't want to even get into a fight over this because we are in such a good place (other than this) right now.

Unfortunately, the cord has started to fray where it attaches to the plate, and while of course my original plan was to just tape it up with electrical tape, I then went and lost the plate itself moving back and forth from my parents' place for Christmas. 

I'm still hoping it'll turn up, but in case it doesn't, I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for a BIFL mug warmer, because I'll definitely want to replace it with one that's better made. I searched through a few posts on this sub about BIFL mug warmers but there didn't seem to be much consensus on good ones, except for one post about a Mr. Coffee mug warmer which the user had only had for five years (much better than my old one's one year before starting to degrade, but still not proven to be BIFL).

Help & Thoughts?,"I’ve noticed in the past few months on my Creatista Uno that if I brew two capsules one after the other, the second capsule partially leaks into the capsule container.

The first capsule brews fine and perfectly. With the second, I can see the coffee coming out of the spout as normal while some leaks into the capsule container via a little “waterfall” through the capsule container window at the same time. I’d say about 1/4 of the second brew ends up in the capsule container.

Again, this only seems to be on the second capsule when brewing one after the other. If the machine cools down and is used later in the day, same thing, first capsule is fine and second leaks. 

Perhaps a descaling will help (even though the machine descale light is not on yet since the last descale)? I’ve taken very good care of the machine over the years and only use official Nespresso capsules, no third-party capsules ever.

** My circumstances / Vent ahead **

Just wanted to share some things in hopes I would feel better. Since I don't have many people to talk to & whomever i know are busy with their lives ( not everyone is a bedrotter like me ). So I'm just sharing it here. 

I 18M dropper prepping for JEE mains. 
I had no idea about JEE when i was in 11+12 ; i just thought it was some exam to get in IITs only. It was drilled in my mind , that Boards percentage are everything and so I believed I'd get a good college just by scoring well in boards.
My parents are just 12th passed so even they knew nothing, and there was no guidance for me whatsoever.
Fast forward near the end of 12 , a classmate came to school the second time , he was dummy since he was prepping for JEE and I got enlightened from him that Entrances are required to get into almost every average to good college.

With just 2-3 months left for Boards , i decided to focus on Boards for now and will just try for a college in my city however ;
The ISSUE - My Adhar Card had so many discrepancies - My lastname name was in Short form, My DoB month was wrong , my father's name had a spelling mistake. So THERE WENT MY CHANCES OF GETTING INTO ANY COLLEGE. I knew that by the time I would get my documents corrected, it would be too late , so i just took a drop to explore my options.

Started -July thru online coaching ; In  AUGUST - Got an autoimmune problem which caused hives and itchy skin bumps over my body ( mainly thighs and chest ). Went to doc - he gave antihistamines which would make me sleepy , sometimes i would sleep like 14-16 hours a day. 
The bumps would go away and then come back in the same spots ,  this cycle continued.
But this condition wasn't improving , tried changing doctors , not much effect ; then i just focused on limiting my diet. ( Protein intake used to cause flare up more easily ).
The condition improved in Dec ; ( still get a few flare ups once around 2 weeks that clear within 5-6 hours )

Overall , due to all this , my preparation wasn't good.
January came ; tried whatever i could study , but lost it completely when First attempt came near. I would just get anxious and not be able to focus or retain anything.
Wasted the last week before my attempt doing nothing. Gave the exam - wasn't too bad ( 35 attemps )  , and definitely wasn't good.

Here I am now ; trying to do my best for the Second Attempt.
My health has been better lately with very few short term flareups ,But I'm feeling underwhelmed, and not enough motivated to study.

I like science , but i hate solving those jee problems. I like reading, so I'm more of a theory kinda guy.
I wanted to try for NEST , get a Bsc degree and study Physics. Get a masters and keep indulging into physics , exploring it and possibly go for a Phd and research. But I'm an only child , and my father is the weak chain in my family who is just corroding evrything. I want to get myself and my mom away from him and i need money obviously, and it would take longer for the Msc+Phd route whereas i could work up to get a job just after my Btech. So , i entered this JEE race.


Tbh IIT is not my dream , it never was. I just wanted to get some decent college , pursue my bachelor's, look for a stable job which doesn't weigh on me much and pursue my hobbies ; with enough pay to support me and my future family, that's it.
I don't even desire something extraordinary, my only dream is to just have a small happy family with me being stable enough to hold on to it.


Right now , I'm feeling empty completely , like , I don't even care about anything, there is just a belief that i will find a way somehow. Am i worried about my result - No ; Am i worried about my future - No ; my brain feels like it hurts from thinking too much , but I don't even have any thoughts to think about. I just wanna sip on some coffee and lay in bed for the time being , and do the thinking for the next day.

Yeah that's it. Thanks for reading and please pardon whatever mistakes i made while writing this.

Just pray for me & for my better tomorrow.",6,1738347347.0,JEENEETards,4,1.0,False

# Introduction

Have you ever dreamed of turning your love for travel into a fulfilling venture? That’s exactly what happened when I transitioned from being a passionate tourist to a dedicated vacation rental host. My journey with Llivo, the [best vacation rental agency in the USA](https://www.llivo.com/), has been nothing short of transformative. Along the way, I discovered the joy of sharing my space, meeting incredible people, and creating unforgettable experiences. Let me take you through the steps, challenges, and rewards of this journey and how Llivo played a pivotal role in making it possible.

https://preview.redd.it/c1j5o3vfedge1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=bac657060bd5c5c6119a7c51253907a9904c5403

# The Spark: From Traveler to Host

# Inspiration from Unforgettable Stays

My transition to hosting began with a memorable trip to a charming beach town where I stayed at a quaint rental. The host’s warmth and attention to detail made me feel truly at home. That experience stayed with me, and I realized I wanted to recreate that feeling for others. Hosting became my way of offering the same joy, comfort, and human connection that I had experienced.

# The Decision to Start Hosting

The decision wasn’t immediate, but after years of traveling and seeing the value of unique stays, I decided to open my doors to travelers. I knew I wanted to do more than just provide accommodations — I wanted to offer a personalized experience that made guests feel welcomed and valued.

# Getting Started as a Host

# 1. Preparing My Space

I started by transforming my spare room into a cozy retreat. I added thoughtful touches like local art, comfortable bedding, and a guidebook to nearby attractions. These details, inspired by my own travels, became the foundation of my hosting philosophy.

# 2. Listing with Llivo

Finding the right platform was crucial, and Llivo stood out for its transparent pricing and user-friendly tools. With just a *12% host fee* and *$0 guest fee*, Llivo made it easy to list my property and attract the right guests. [Learn more about hosting with Llivo](https://www.llivo.com/p/benefits-of-listing-on-llivo).

# 3. Welcoming My First Guests

The first booking was both exciting and nerve-wracking. I greeted my guests with a personalized welcome note and shared recommendations for local hidden gems. Their glowing review affirmed my decision to become a host and motivated me to continue.

# Challenges and Lessons Learned

# 1. Balancing Expectations

One of the biggest challenges was balancing guest expectations with my own capabilities. I quickly learned the importance of clear communication, setting boundaries, and being upfront about house rules and amenities.

# 2. Creating Memorable Experiences

Guests often mentioned how much they appreciated small gestures, like a stocked coffee bar or a list of my favorite local restaurants. These touches didn’t cost much but added immense value to their stay.

# 3. Navigating Logistics

From scheduling cleanings to managing bookings, hosting requires organization. Llivo’s platform simplified many of these tasks, allowing me to focus on what mattered most: creating meaningful connections with my guests.

# Why Llivo Makes Hosting Better

# 1. Transparent Pricing

Llivo’s transparent pricing model ensures that hosts earn more while guests enjoy competitive rates. This approach fosters trust and satisfaction for both parties.

# 2. Building Human Connections

Unlike other platforms, Llivo emphasizes the importance of relationships. Their mission of turning strangers into friends aligns perfectly with my own hosting philosophy. [Explore Llivo’s story](https://www.llivo.com/p/about) to learn more about their vision.

# 3. Personalized Support

From listing optimization to customer service, Llivo’s support team has been invaluable. They provide the tools and guidance needed to succeed as a host.

# The Rewards of Hosting

# 1. Financial Freedom

Hosting provided me with an additional income stream, which I used to travel more and reinvest in my property. Llivo’s fair fees made this even more rewarding.

# 2. Cultural Exchange

One of the most fulfilling aspects of hosting has been meeting people from diverse backgrounds. Every guest brings a unique perspective, making each stay an enriching experience.

# 3. Personal Growth

Hosting has taught me patience, empathy, and the importance of attention to detail. It’s more than just a business; it’s a way to grow as a person while making a difference in others’ lives.

# Conclusion

Transitioning from tourist to host has been one of the most rewarding journeys of my life. It’s not just about opening my home; it’s about sharing my story, building connections, and creating memories that last a lifetime. Platforms like [Llivo](https://www.llivo.com/) have made this journey seamless, empowering hosts like me to thrive. If you’ve ever considered hosting, I encourage you to take the leap — you might just discover a new passion and purpose along the way.

**Between 1993 and 1995, Peter Lynch shared a set of letters that described simple ways to pick stocks and understand the market.** From 1977 to 1990, Magellan earned about 29% each year on average, which was one of the best records ever seen. Even after stepping away from daily management, Lynch still tried to help regular people learn how to invest. **His letters from the mid-1990s show the same common-sense ideas that helped him before.** They offer tips on noticing local signs, recognizing cycles, figuring out the right price to pay for growth companies, and spotting turnarounds.

# Local Signals and Simple Checks

Lynch often said, “A stock is not a lottery ticket.” When you buy a stock, you own part of a real business. That is why it can help to see that business in action. **If you own shares in a restaurant chain, go there and have a meal. Talk to the staff if you get the chance. Check if the place is busy or if the food is good.** When the stock price dips for no clear reason, your real-life knowledge might tell you the business is still fine. If it is still drawing in customers, you might wait and hold the stock. 

He pointed out that small, everyday details can give big hints. Suppose you see a new coffee shop at the mall that always has a line. Or maybe there’s a small sporting goods store in your town that keeps opening more branches. **In either case, you might have noticed a future winner before the big banks on Wall Street do.**

Still, Lynch did not say “buy it right away.” **He felt you should do some research next. Look at the annual report if you can. Read the earnings statements. Check if the company’s sales and profits have gone up each year. Also see if it has a lot of debt or if it generates steady cash.** A thriving shop can look crowded yet still have shaky finances. So your early clue must match the facts. If both line up, you might have found a strong investment.

Lynch said professional money managers often miss these hands-on clues. They might follow strict rules that keep them from visiting all these stores. An individual investor, on the other hand, can watch local trends as they happen.

# Cyclicals, Timing, and Housing Stocks

Lynch also wrote about cyclical stocks. These are companies that do well when the economy grows, but terrible when it slows. Examples include car makers and steel mills. When times are bad, many people give up on these stocks, which can push prices down. But if the firm can survive and wait for the next upswing, the stock often bounces back quickly.

**People who work in these fields might notice early signs of a rebound. Maybe their own factory is adding more shifts. Or maybe local suppliers are hiring more truck drivers. That could mean demand is rising again. Lynch thought regular investors could use this insider’s edge.**

He also liked to point out the effect of housing. When housing picks up, people buy furniture, paint, carpet, and appliances. Companies that make or sell these items can see higher sales. If you pay attention to home sales or see a lot of “sold” signs in your area, you might guess that furniture stores or home-improvement chains could do well. Lynch called these second-wave benefits from a housing boom.

He recommends being curious and seeing the signs of recovery in these industries. If you invest in these cyclical companies at a good time, you can have great returns

# Growth Stocks at Fair Prices

One of Lynch’s strongest skills was picking growth stocks. These are companies with sales and profits that increase year after year. **He believed that strong brands, good leadership, or new ideas could help these firms grow for a long time.** But he also warned that a good business is not always a good investment if the share price is too high.

He would compare the stock price to the company’s earnings line over time. If the price soared above that line, he worried it might be overpriced. Growth stocks can look exciting, but paying too much can lead to poor returns if earnings do not keep up. **He urged people to look for growth stocks that still trade at fair values (sometimes investing is really that simple).**

# Turnarounds and the Road to Recovery

Another key topic for Lynch was turnarounds. These are companies that once did well, but then collapsed. Maybe their products went out of style, or they made bad spending choices. Lynch said large companies with real assets can sometimes come back to life if they fix their mistakes.

He pointed to Chrysler as an example. It almost went bankrupt, but then secured enough funds, streamlined its operations, and returned to profit. Sears, too, closed its poorly performing catalog and sold off certain divisions to get cash. Once Sears showed better earnings, its stock rose again.

However, Lynch also saw plenty of firms that tried to cut costs but never found new ways to grow. **He said real turnarounds need fresh demand and solid products that customers want. It is not enough just to fire staff or cut marketing. If nobody buys what you offer, the business stays weak.** Also, smaller companies might not have the money or brand power to recover, so he recommended looking for big companies with a lot of cash. And the recovery must lead to bigger revenue. If a company only cuts costs and does not increase its revenue, the investment might be mediocre.

# Checking the Basics of a Company

In his letters, Lynch gave simple steps for research:

* **Earnings growth:** Is it steady over several years? Or does it fluctuate a lot?
* **Debt:** How much does the firm owe? Can it pay interest without trouble?
* **Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E):** Is the stock cheaper or more expensive than its industry peers?
* **Dividends (if any):** Do they pay a dividend? Is it safe or likely to grow?
* **Balance sheet strength:** Does the company have real assets or cash on hand if it hits a downturn?

He believed that looking at these basics was enough for most individual investors to make a wise choice.

# Conclusion

Lynch liked to say that individual investors can beat Wall Street if they pay attention. For instance, parents might notice which kids’ toys are in high demand. College students might see which new streaming app is popular on campus. These small clues add up. If you notice a product or service that solves a real need and is spreading fast, you might look into the stock. Don’t make the process too complex. Ask the right questions, and you’ll become a great investor.

1iel8h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1iel8h9/a_quick_little_stim_shot_i_would_call_it/,A quick little 'stim shot' I would call it,"Hi everyone, I want to start by saying that I thank all the men who take the time to spread their stories and educate everybody else who may be going through something similar to circumstances around the world.

(this may take a little to read so grab a coffee but I hope my story can motivate some people to learn to love themselves truly)

I am 24, male from England, a quick summary of my past; lockdown started in 2020, I then 6 months in got cancer, which tbh I think I was very strong through, then starting uni I got a gf, which for the most part of the 2 years we were together I thought were great. I think most men can agree when I say I think I was so happy because in reality, I was too naive to most girls actual intentions in the world today.

Fast forward to 1 and a half years into out relationship she wanted to end during our placement year at university because of my 'behaviour' which I eventually found out through a lot fo therapy and youtube that it was all actually reactive abuse as she was the only person I had ever said horrible things to my whole life and it took me finding out about narcissism to actually understand who to keep and who to rid of in my life.

I think the same to most people I ruminated for around 9 months, living in a constant state of depression moving from alcohol to trying new substances to just numb the pain. yh it hurt a lot but I am happy that it actually turned me into the man I am today.

Fast forward to right now I decided to start 75 hard this year as my resolution and it has actually been the best decision of my whole life. Socail media in all has COMPLETELY FUCKED everyone in my opinion. STOP drinking, STOP doing drugs, STOP any and all quick hits og dopamine(with the exception of nicotine as that is still my one sin I still do but I do hold myself completely accountable for that.

Around 15 days into my 75 hard (by this I mean 15 days not masturbating looking at any type or Corn or staying away from baity social media posts,) the desexualisation of my mind has completely changed my way of life. I will take full accountability of the fact that before my narcisstic Ex I was a drug addict I did party way too much and I was stuck in that loop of chasing women which I think we can actually all agree we have done for a small or large majority of our lives. My small message is WAKE THE F-CK UP you don't need a modern women right now, you don't need to be as rich as you may want. You don't need to have flashy stuff or have something to prove. Man just be you for god sake? i know this is some kinda harsh words you can even say, but bulletproofing my mind has changed everything. It has taken me 10 months so please don't think this is another one of those overnight things. It is ALL resistance and dedication, ignore motivation that crap is bollocks honestly, The days you don't want to go to the gym are the days you should be going, that hour you said you were going to read do it just because u have prioritised something over it does not mean that is more important. Your time is your time yes friends and family is important but when ur family eventually pass and ur friends 'move on' you can only save yourself.

Just know I may have said this all but I believe in all of u, I belive in everyone, no matter the mistakes u may have made or are currently making, just change them, I am not a believer in any religion but one thing I do believe in is hard work now, look at this economy we have built? look at the architecture, the transportation, the manufacturing, the safety of most modern countries? who was It all built by? US but the only difference between us and our ancestors is that they got up and did it completely disregarding how they may feel emotionally today. Surely most of you can agree that doing something you didn't want to do always made you feel better afterwards. You don't need anyone to believe in you, heck you don't even need your family to believe in you. JUST BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. I will always believe in anyone that wants to make a change in their lives no matter how significant it maybe.

I lastly want to say that the only reason I feel that i had to write this in such a brutal format is because from people i have met and people i currently hang with, men DEFINITELY mature through pain, feel the trauma you experienced embrace it, nurture it, you could even say make it your bitch. The only people that will ever remember you for lifetimes to come is your kids. i don't even have kids, but the last thing i want them thinking is that their dad, grandad, greatgrandad etc etc was a failure or didn't do what they set out to do

ITS YOU VS YOU

Make yourself proud. I also want to apologise for how informal my writing maybe this is just as much of a vent as it is motivation. I am so thoroughly disappointed in the way most people live these days. Ignore everyone who talks down or disrespects. Make this year about proving EVERYONE wrong, Be the change you want to see in the world and people will always follow

I love you all, stay safe and ALWAYS stay Strong ❤️

Last thing I wanted to say was that this is exactly what I wanted to hear at the end of my relationship and I hope hearing this pushes some of you beautiful people to take a stand for your own self worth and your own beautiful life you are building x",7,1738347224.0,GuyCry,7,0.9,False
