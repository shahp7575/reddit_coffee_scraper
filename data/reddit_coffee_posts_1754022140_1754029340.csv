1meozen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1meozen/aio_my_teen_will_not_come_with_us_to_our_family/,"AIO, My teen will not come with us to our family vacation.","I want to start to by saying, I love my teen (14) very much. I don’t want to bring his along with us because his attitude is terrible and if I continue to give in it’ll get worse. The that I picked him up and her brother (6)from his dad, he began cussing at me and his brother for everything. It was over absolutely nothing, I stopped by to get coffee and asked him if she wanted coffee, she rolled his eyes and yelled “no, wft”. Then his brother said he wanted a hot chocolate and my teen told my son to “shut the f*ck up, your voice is so annoying!”. I asked him to stop, so he started to argue with me, he said “he wouldn’t have to tell him to shut up if I taught him to be less annoying” . After that mess, we went to the mall, my kids needed back to school clothes. Here’s where it gets messy. My sonhas been talking to gang members, he used to follow them. He wants to dress like them, I found pictures of him throwing gang signs, I caught him smoking, ect. I don’t allow any gang related outfits in my house. (My family had history with gangs. I want NOTHING to do with that). So, he found very baggy pants that were through sizes too big. He loves to wear his pants under his butt. I said no to that choice. And that’s where my hell started. He kept asking and asking, when I tired to leave the store he blocked me. I managed to leave he continue to follow me and asked and get in my way. He kept pressing me for answers after I asked him to stop, so I told him one of the reasons; “he’s thin, the pants are way to wide and it looks like he has hips, he looks like a girl”. I feel bad for telling him but it’s the truth, that’s exactly what was on my mind when he tried them on. I know it hurt his feelings and I feel terrible about it. So I decided that it was time to go home. He kept insisting and calling me names and telling me that, “everyone hates me because I overreact” “ I’m projecting” “he f*cking hated me”. I took his phone away, he told me I was “making him responsible for my feelings” and “I should let it slide” and just buy him the pants he wanted because the reason why people including him hated me is because there’s always give immediate consequences” , so I took his tv away. When we got home, he was persistent. He kept asking “why”, I would answer and he would insult me/mock me and follow me around the house. He didn’t stop so my 6 year son and I went  outside and played. When we came back I made dinner and we ate. My teen threw trash on the floor and looked at me to see if I would react (he likes to do this a lot). After dinner he started up again. He kept insulting me and my 6 year son told him to stop so my oldest told him to “shut the f up, little bit(h”. I realized that our vacation would be completely ruined if I bring my teen along. Whenever he doesn’t get his way, he makes sure no one has fun. Am I overreacting by not letting him come with us? I just want to have a nice experience with at least one of my kids. I know my teen wants to come, he has been looking forward to the trip for a long while now. After I told him that he wasn’t coming with us, he apologized but I think he just wanted his stuff back and to come with us to our vacation. I don’t know if I overreacted, I just wanted him to stop",1,1754029227.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

So I started a small weekly hangout — in a 300-year-old Thai house in Bang Khen (near Don Mueang). It’s quiet, green, grounding, and open for anyone craving slow living, meaningful convos, and some good coffee.

We call it Coffee & Connect ☕🌿
It happens every Wednesday – next one is Aug 6, 6pm - 8pm.

Not promoting anything – just love seeing nomads meet, share, reset. If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, feel free to DM and I’ll send you the invite 🙌

P.S. If you have favorite nomad-friendly spots or low-key meetups in Bangkok, I’d love to hear them too!",2,1754029136.0,Bangkok,1,1.0,False

1meox1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1meox1j/how_do_you_guys_have_the_patience_to_clean_your/,How do you guys have the patience to clean your teeth every day?,"My dentist told me that I’ve developed some cavities during the six months I’ve been wearing Invisalign, apparently due to not properly caring for my teeth. Honestly, I’m not surprised. It was such a hassle: every time I ate or drank coffee, I had to remove my aligners, and then thoroughly clean my teeth before putting them back in. It really annoy and I don't have the patience for this

What frustrates me even more is that I’ve seen other people say they didn’t clean their teeth meticulously while wearing Invisalign, yet their teeth remained perfectly fine. Clearly, I’m not one of the lucky ones. I’ve been a long-time Sonicare user, my first electric toothbrush was from them, but once I started Invisalign, I noticed that while the brush does a good job cleaning the surface of my teeth, food particles still get stuck between them. So I had to rely heavily on flossing, which not only took a lot of time but also often left my gums sore or even cut

After sharing with my dentist , he recommended trying a soocas toothbrush, which combines an electric toothbrush and a water flosser in one device. So I don’t even need to floss after using the electric toothbrush, and I was just like… what? Why didn’t anyone tell me this earlier? I’ve been struggling with brushing every day like it’s some kind of torture...So I’m curious,has anyone else found effective ways to reduce the time it takes to keep your teeth clean while wearing Invisalign or braces?

1meowfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1meowfm/hard_to_stick_to_your_diet/,hard to stick to your diet?,"Im pretty new here and to the life of PCOS in general, just wanted to say that i’m not at all very well educated on a lot of things about it just yet.

One thing I have been  noticing a lot of comments on is the diet and weight loss part of things. When I was originally given the diet though, there’s was very little I actually had to change. I pretty much eat regularly still for the most part with slight adjustments. I’m vegetarian also but I don’t think that part is much to do with it.

I eat mostly mexican food almost 100%. It’s got a lot of the things we need to be eating already. I’m not sure what recipes would help everyone best but if anyone wants any let me know but when you look for mexican recipes make sure it’s the indigenous way of making food and not the more modern/simple. I would say the best things from my diet that are beneficial to PCOS are calabacitas, beans, nopales, salsa, and sopa de lentil. 

the thing is these recipes were made before it was possible to fry it or use some flavor packets or whatever. it’s all just vegetables literally. a lot of people make beans with oil but you really don’t need to. The way my family cooks hasn’t really had to change at all so all of these things don’t take like the “healthy” version and it honestly taste better than the stuff you get at your local tex mex stop. 

there are TONS of viejitas on facebook who share recipes of their regions and families and tribes that are mainly beans, onions, garlic, chiles, and greens and that’s how it’s made for the flavor not for the health. most mexican recipes center around tomato, onion, garlic, pinto bean, broth, chiles, and squash so if you have access to those at your grocery store, you have access to real mexican food without the help of ortega or mission or any of those other crappy sodium filled brands.

I will say while there’s been times I’ve struggled severely with my weight it’s usually been while I was eating an american diet, here we just rely too heavily on simple carbs and sugar. if you don’t like mexican food im sure there are plenty of other cultures with very healthy diets.

I just wanted to put this out there since Ive seen so many people on here talking about how they are struggling with they’re weight and diet I don’t think you have to cut out everything good and yummy you just have to find some new yummy things you maybe didn’t know about. For me, mexican food is amazing and i prefer the way we make it at home honestly compared to any restaurant i’ve ever been to and its also probably healthier than any restaurant too. 

I also will say too that Ive noticed a lot of people talking like you have to cut out everything single drop of sugar and fries and such to lose weight with PCOS but you really don’t. Just learn how to balance it, thinking you have to cut it out entirely is a direct highway to ED. I eat desert every single day still because I was a sweet tooth all my life. The thing is now instead of eating a sweet after every meal I only have it with my black coffee after breakfast and it’s usually about 4-5 bites of whatever it is. That way you can still enjoy the nice things, but you’re not killing your metabolism with all that sugar, and then it lasts longer too and you can eat it over more days!

Also mexican dessert is much healthier than american, and I would also assume other countries like japan and such have much healthier desserts than america.",1,1754028923.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False
1meoutw,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1meoutw/ellis/,Ellis,"Ellis blinked her eyes awake in her small Baltimore apartment. Black wallpaper painted with red symbols made her room seem like an endless abyss—all the better to meditate with. An ebony cuckoo clock ticked on the wall, each tick sounding like thunder. 

Where had she been the night before? Dryness glued her tongue to the roof of her mouth like cotton.  The clock erupted into a sound of chirps, each one pounding agony into her head. She screamed at the clock, and the wall became soft, like shifting quicksand, swallowing half of the timepiece before solidifying. The gears whirred before stopping with a pop. 

Ellis rolled her eyes. “That’s bloody great,” she sighed as she popped migraine medication to soothe the pain. Her kitchen was yellow and dingy, lacking the luster of the small bedroom. She put espresso grounds into a French Press and set the water to boil. 

A box of Royal Farms chicken tenders lay in the refrigerator, alongside expired milk and a box of Natty Bo beer. She heated the stale fried chicken and put it on an English muffin with some gravy. Hoping the stale fast food would ease the pounding in her head.

As she sipped her coffee, she remembered the pulsing sound of the nightclub: gunfire and the blare of alarms. The microwave dinged, and she nearly yelled at it but held her tongue. She couldn’t afford a new microwave. 

Her food was too hot, but the caffeine and salt soothed her aching head. Memory flooded back. She had gone to Club Orpheus, a small club in Baltimore, right inside the Inner Harbor. 

Ellis remembered the phone call from her dealer—a simple bargain done in the night. A quarter sheet of LSD, and a bag of shrooms, five moons of ecstasy for five hundred dollars, it was practically stealing. The hallucinations unlocked the key to her soul, her mana, and her magic.

Sighing, she grabbed an old chicken bone wrapped in some red thread for protection and scribbled down a few sigils with Sharpie on post-it notes, folded them, and stuck them into her little dragon backpack.   Even a little power and protection were better than none at all.

Ellis took the fire exit instead of the elevator; no cameras were there yet, and walked down the grimy street to Club Orpheus.

When she arrived at the club, the floor was nearly empty.  No crowds meant it would be harder to remain inconspicuous.  A small bar and some lounge chairs sat upstairs.  She ordered her usual, a shot of absinthe that glowed green in the black light. The drink preparation always enchanted her, the sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon while they poured cold water into the drink, turning it neon green. 

She tolerated the taste of the drink as it made every dark and neon color brighter, crisper, and clearer. Black light and red lasers bounced against the disco ball, and the colors entranced her.

A hand tapped her on the shoulder. Turning around sharply to a young man in a ball cap, baggy jeans, and a red hoodie who stood behind her.

“Are you Ellis?” he asked.

She looked around, making sure no one was in earshot. “I am.”

On a paper napkin, the young man wrote, *Your order is ready for pickup.*

*Right O. May I sample a tab?* She spoke into the young man’s mind directly. He looked disoriented and became very guarded. Ellis rolled her eyes and wrote the same message on the napkin. She forgot she was dealing with a person unpracticed in magic. Everyone had some version of magic, some version of power in their soul, but most refused to recognize it for what it was.  There was no such thing as the mundane.

He reached into his pocket and produced a small piece of paper the size of a postage stamp, adorned with a yellow smiley face. She eyed the young man, trying to grasp the slightest thought. There was nothing in return but steel and reserve. If he were an undercover cop, she was sol.

But then again, if she tripped hard enough, she could escape the cop’s clutches. Letting out a sigh, she put the piece of paper on her tongue and slowly finished her drink. Kaleidoscopic colors exploded around her. The disco ball exploded into a psychedelic orb of color. 

*The rest of your order is available. Follow me.* The young man wrote on the folded napkin.

*Well, if this is entrapment, I’m at least able to tap into my gnosis.* Ellis thought as a grin grew on her face. She strolled down the stairs, watching as each step became a jagged platform jutting from the floor. Colors swirled around. The young man grabbed her hand and pulled her out of Club Orpheus.

The trails that flowed off each car mesmerized her as the young man led her to his car. She pulled herself out of her daze and eyed him over.

“No mate, you have another thing coming if ya think I’m going to go alone into a car with ya,” she said.

“He’s not alone,” said a voice inside the car. Inside sat a bald man with a goatee, all of his teeth replaced by gold fangs. Contacts turned his eyes pale blue and slitted like a cat.. A gang of drug dealers, at least, was less public than cops, but infinitely more dangerous. She contemplated bending space around her. She could form a portal back to her apartment and call it a day. But curiosity pulled her forward. She never expected to live long anyway, and she wanted to find out where this road led.

She sat in the back seat, grinning wildly. Her grins turned into uncontrollable cackles. 

“Yo, are you sure this is the one, the Buja?”

The man in the red hoodie nodded and said little.

The car took off, and they drove away from the inner harbor into the heart of the city. The bright lights turned into crumbling buildings covered with graffiti. Ellis focused on the trails of each light. Rap barked through the speakers, and she tried to grab onto the lyrics. If she focused on one verse, one idea, she could get out of this mess.

Ellis overheard the gangsters' thoughts while they were driving into the city.  The man in the red hoodie, Diego, thought that the fanged man, Dante, was insane. And that their boss was insane for sending them on a trip to find a Bruja, a witch.  What kind of fairy tale assed shit were these people tripping on?  All he saw was a girl in the back seat, one who dressed up all scary to keep people off her turf.  He understood that, but she was tripping, just like they were.  If they kept this up, the police would be on them for sure.

The fanged man's thoughts were a little less ordered.  His name was Dante. The moment she tried to listen to them, she was blasted by DMX lyrics in high volume.

*""I wouldn't try that, Bruja.  I know the magic of the street, Chere, you don't want no smoke with me.""*

So Dante was a mage, noted.  Ellis sighed and sank back into her seat, watching blankly out the window.  Was this boss a mage?  She would have to think of a way out if things got messy. She stared at the trails of lights while thinking of an exit plan.

The car stopped abruptly in front of an abandoned warehouse. The air smelled of decaying brick and garbage as they opened the car door. The man with the fangs took her by the hand. 

“The boss wants to talk to you.”

“Boss, who’s this boss, love? I thought you had my order, and might I say this is a bit out of the way for such a deal?”

Both men looked at each other and shrugged.

“And you’re sure this is the Bruja?” asked the man with fangs.

“Look, they told us to look for a mixed girl with an English accent that was constantly tippin,” said the man in the hoodie.

“So, is my order in the building or not?” asked Ellis, pretending not to hear them.

The young man in the red hoodie motioned with his head toward the building. Ellis got out and followed them into the warehouse. The city abandoned it and left it to ruin, with boarded windows and graffiti decorating the walls.

They led her inside the building to where a young man sat. He was wearing a red dress shirt with black slacks. Gold chains circled his neck, and a giant ruby ring adorned his hand. He smiled, revealing canines capped with gold. 

 Her pulse quickened; it was the Red Specter, or at least that was his street name, also known as Especter Rojo to the Latin Kings. He was a kingpin in Baltimore’s drug cartels. The cops never found him. He had tracks to cover his tracks, a long past riddled with dead fall guys. 

“Hello, Governa’,” said Ellis, grinning ear to ear.

The man across the table raised an eyebrow. He shifted in his seat and eyed the man in the red hoodie. “So you bring me the Bruja, but she’s tripping hard. Take a look at her pupils.”

“She asked for a sample. I had to show I was legit.”

“Ah, Gov. About the sample, do ya have the rest of my order?” asked Ellis.

The Specter glared through her, his dark eyes cold and calculating. “I’m sorry that they misinformed you. This meeting is not about an order but a job offer. Now, I’d rather wait until you’re sober. I don’t make deals with people whose judgment is compromised.”

“Ah, a gentleman, my judgment wouldn’t be much clearer. I’m rarely sober these days, and when I am, my muscles ache and my head is full of cobwebs.”

The Specter shook his head. “That’s no way to live. I require all my dealers to remain sober on the job. What they do off the clock is their own business, but I can’t have them messing around with my profits because they were…incapacitated.”

Ellis took out a clove cigarette. “May I?”

“Sure.” The Specter fished a Zippo out of his front pocket. It was silver with red horns; El Diablo was inscribed on the bottom. Ellis lit her cigarette, scenting the room with burning tobacco and spices. She blew out smoke rings and watched as they rippled and morphed before finally dissipating into the humid air.

“So, what makes you think I want to deal with you?” she asked.

“I’m not asking. You’ve been selling my real estate. Anyway, the drugs aren’t the point. I heard you had other talents, Bruja.”

“Don’t call me that.”

“Don’t you use magic? They told me you make people disappear.”

Ellis smiled and raised an eyebrow. “My mom is from Cuba. She practices Santeria, which is a closed practice. I’m a Chaote, I'm a Mage, not a Bruja,” said Ellis. Her accent switched from British to a nasal East Baltimore dialect.

“Chaote?”

“Chaos magic, where nothing is true and everything is permitted.  We have no set rules, and belief is our tool.  A Bruja, at least like my mum, follows family traditions, ancestor worship in the like.  There's power in it, but it's limited.”

The Specter turned towards his underlings. “You brought me an internet magician? Not a Bruja but some east side hood rat that dabbles on the internet.”

“I beg your pardon?” asked Ellis. Her British accent returning.

The Specter took out a gun and pointed it at Ellis’**s** head.

“You work for me now. I get a fifty percent cut of everything you sell, and if you dare snitch, there won’t be anything left of you to testify.” He stroked her hair back with his gun. “I traffic in more than drugs, and they’ll never find you again. You’re gonna wish your brains were spattered over the wall. Is your internet magic going to protect you now?”

Ellis grinned. How dare this whelp point a gun at her?  How dare he threaten her?  He had no idea what power he was up against.

 She focused on the point of the gun and the space surrounding it, and small cracks began to form in the wall behind them.  The air swirled around her, and she imagined colors bursting. She grabbed onto a crimson thread in her mind and tugged, and the unraveling began.

 The scent of ozone filled the air as the cracks widened.  A hot wind blew through the warehouse as the cracks split open to a portal.  On the other side opened into an inky abyss.

""Fuck this shit, I'm out!"" Diego shouted as he ran at top speed out of the warehouse.

Dante smiled knowingly and nodded.  ""Well played.  I think it's time I see myself out.""  He pounded his chest twice, and energy crackled around him in a shield as he casually walked out.

“How is that for computer magic, love?""

A cold sweat formed on the Specter's brow, and his mouth hung open in disbelief.  If Dante had left, he knew he was in over his head.  He stepped back slowly.

""Miss, I offer you my sincerest apologies.  Maybe we can work out a deal.""

""Deal?  You thought I was some weak-minded internet witch that you could control?  Love, the internet is on every phone, every search, and every breath.  I am the Red Queen of the webs, and I am everywhere.""

 Ellis gave the Specter a hard shove through the portal before zipping it shut. The Specter's screams echoed on the other side.  She sighed and crossed her arms.

“All this and I didn't even get my sheet of acid.  What a ripoff. Screw this, I'm going home”.  Honestly, dealing with gangs was too much work in the long run. 

Ellis formed another small portal and stepped back through to her apartment. She promptly crashed on the bed before falling into a deep sleep.

The Red Specter felt the fires of hell licking at his skin, peeling back years of power and sin with every agonizing flare. His empire, his reputation—it all burned around him. He had ruled with fear, brokered blood for loyalty, and carved his turf out of chaos. And now, the darkness claimed him. Eternal. Unforgiving.

The ground shook beneath him. Heat pulsed against his face.

Something struck his cheek.

He gasped, and the flames vanished. Smoke gave way to smog. The sulfurous air turned to the sharp tang of overheated asphalt. Above him, no red skies—only the blinding mid-July sun, buzzing flies, and the sound of children laughing in the distance.

A tennis ball rolled lazily off his chest and into the gutter.



“See, I told you he wasn’t dead,” said a small boy as he took a hockey stick and put the ball back in the middle of the street. 

“It’s your team to serve,” he said to a taller, lankier boy. Both had the same dark hair and eyes and looked like brothers.

“Mr., please move out of the way. You’re kinda in the middle of our game,” said the older boy.

The Specter got up and brushed himself off. 

“Where’d he come from?” asked the smaller boy.

“I don’t know, he just sort of appeared,” shrugged his brother.

“Hey, kids, where am I?” asked the man in red. 

“Rosemont Ave? Sir, are you lost?” The younger boy raised an eyebrow.

“Very.. Rosemont Avenue, am I in Frederick?”

“Where’s Frederick?” 

“Frederick, Maryland.”

“Oh no, Sir, you’re in Trenton. You must be lost, huh?” The older boy dragged his brother away and glared at Miguel.

So that was it. The Bruja had transported him to Trenton, New Jersey. It may not have been hell, but it was close enough. Fishing through his pocket, he found his cell phone and called his nearest contact. The phone was answered after a few rings.

“Yo, El Spectre, how’s it going?”

“I’ve been better. I have to ask a favor. I need a ride. I’m on Rosemont Ave.”

“Well, I’m in the middle of a shift right now-”

“I’m not asking, I’m telling you.”

“All right, I’m coming down.”

The phone hung up, and twenty minutes later, a green geo prism pulled up. The engine sounded like it had better days. Inside was a skinny man with a band t-shirt and a disheveled blonde ponytail.

“Duude, how did you get up here, and what happened to your whip?”

He looked at the stoner with dead eyes. “It’s a long story. I don’t want to talk.”

“Where to, boss?”

The Red Specter thought for a long time. If Ellis sent him to Trenton, New Jersey, she could find him and banish him to the bottom of the ocean, into the concrete of a building, or to actual hell itself. Nowhere was safe, and he had limited options.

“The nearest police station.”

“Are you smoking crack? Look, if you want to go moral high ground on me, that’s fine, but I’m not going down with you.”

The Red Specter pulled out his gun. “Just drive, drop me off two blocks away from the nearest police station. I got it from here.”

The blond man’s eyes widened. “Yes, boss. But why are you going to the cops now?”

“To turn myself in. It’s the only place left where I’m going to be safe.”

The color left the driver’s face as he drove. He dropped him off on the city block, leaving the Red Specter to live with his choice. He hoped it would work out for him.

Ellis grinned as she remembered the interlude, as the clock made a sickly warbled sound within the walls. She was glad the two underlings ran away. They would spread rumors that she sent the Espectre Rojo to Diablo. Gang members would think twice before they would ever mess with her again.

 But she would have to lie low for a while because OSTA would be on her trail.

She popped one of the last tabs of acid and stared at the sigil on the floor, and imagined warmth pooling around her—a small world full of sunset colors and the beating of her heart.

I always take it with a strong coffee and I feel super buzzed and focused on it, feels like Im getting things done. 

What Ive started to notice in this period of time is that when it wears off I notice the obvious flaws in my train of thought, my false confidence, my obsessiveness over certain things and not moving on and just poor memory recall. 

It also gives me a lack of urgency or priority, I can just obsess over certain trivialities and the day just flys by. It really messes with my sense of time.

It also messes with my stomach acid a lot so I must take antacids with it and it feels like it messes with my cardiovascular system as well. I feel terrible if I do any kind of cardio on it. It spikes the hell out of my anxiety and I get serious depression, doom and gloom, and lethargy on the off days.

It kind of puts me in a loop where I get back on it to feel any kind of motivation.

Well I don't know what to put hahaha, it's my first time at this, but I'm excited. I have a thousand hearts. I feel like someone is going to read me, and that excites me a lot, because I feel like I'm going to be able to be me, tell them my life story, and bring out all that I have inside.

I also want to warn that I don't have good spelling, excuse me little stars ✨

Well, I don't know where to start... but I'm going to introduce myself. I tell them how my day was, and little by little we talk day by day. Do you think so?

My name is Justin (well, it's not, but I like it lol). I am 25 years old. I am a patchy person, everything is good, everything is beautiful 😅.

I'm kind of shy, I don't socialize much, but here we go.

Today I woke up around 9 a.m. I didn't want to see anyone. I woke up hating everyone. Well, I brush, I turn on my cell phone... my heart starts beating. I look to see who spoke.

The truth is I don't have anyone. Only my mom, but I talk to her every day. It would hurt me if he didn't talk to me. But that's not the kind of heartbeat I'm talking about.

I'm talking about another type of heartbeat...
The one of fear.
The one of curiosity.
The one about “what is going to happen today?”

Well, we read messages, you make yourself a coffee, you light a bareto, then a cigarette. I take a bath and my shitty day begins.

I go out to look for public transportation. People look at me as if it were not normal to see a young man stuck.

I get to work, I put on a smile. We cried in the bathroom. Because of the shitty job, the debts, the bad salary.

And what are we going to do?

You wipe away your tears, touch up any smeared dust, and leave with a smile.

I get home, I smoke... and another Justin starts to come out.
One who says he doesn't want to live anymore. That people are bad. That I don't belong here.

But there is another Justin... one who does want to continue.

But he remembers the past... and cries all night until he falls asleep.

And so another new day will begin. Tomorrow.",1,1754028349.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Now to the break up, the two of us were pretty mature about it and agreed that we was going to pay me within 2 weeks (he already had a job) I offer a payment plan and he declined, well the 2 weeks passed and no payment was done, I got drunk and sent him an image of a cat with a suit, ready for business, he left me on seen, when I noticed I texted him, when was he going to pay me? Again no answer, I left him alone. 2 days ago got drunk again and texted him this long message telling him that I gift him the money and he could take that money (if he has it) as my first and last contribution so he could open his coffee shop (a dream of his), that I don't want it and that my gut was right about him, with this I meant he was not going to pay me, told him that I will remember him with love but don't want nothing else to do with him, in 5 minutes he responds telling me to send him my bank info so he could pay me once he gest his next paycheck, and that my gut was the reason our relationship never worked since I always thought he was going to fail me, I explained that when I said my gut was right, it was about the money and that I don't need the money so, for my own mental health since I don't want to ask him again to pay me and I don't need the money I was gifting him the money. Kinda loos like I hurt his ego, we said some other stuff and I just left him on seen, I showed the conversation to my friends and they told me that I was the AH since I didn't knew if he was struggling with money, that basically telling him I don't need the money I was also telling him that I am on a better position than my ex and that the gut thing did sounded like I was expecting my ex to fail me from the beginning, I've done some thinking and I still don't think I'm the AH, so now I guess I want your opinion, am I really the AH on this situation?",1,1754028230.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

So we naturally analyze before being confident with anyone.

But when our analyze tells us : ""Yes, this is a genuine person""...

We activate our Fe and we are less ""weird"" or ""mysterious"".

I discovered this through my holidays in a foreign country...

I found some family there...

I stayed in my Ni dominant function...

But when my aunts talks with me, I know that they are GENUINE, so I'm fully into my Fe and I turn into a funny person, sarcastic, warm and friendly.

Funny enough, when a young beautiful woman came to say ""hi"", my aunt told me ""she is your cousin"", I said hello and I didn't find her ""genuine"" at all (you'll see at the end that my intuition was right). She's extremely beautiful, but when I said hello, she was fast and went to another room immediately (her gaze went down, it's a sign that I intimidate her, or maybe the situation - I learned that in a book haha). I was shy too because my aunts were there... and I'm very pudic when talking to a woman in front of my family, it's not appropriate to be overly talkative directly in front of the family... when she was gone, I immediately reconnected to my Fe to joke with my aunts and my parents. They even told to my mother If I speak the language of the country we are in, to come and drink a coffee. When I went to my car with my parents, my father said : ""this is a shame that the young woman don't talk with her mother"", and my mother replied ""yes, she is malicious"" (maybe it's not the right traduction, but you know what I mean).

So no, we are not weird, we are juste INFJ with a Ni mysterious, deep, maybe spiritual, function... and when we are with genuine people, we activate our lovely Fe function, making us warm, friendly, and even FUNNY !

But in reality, I was actually Nova Kingsley 👑, heir to the Kingsley empire and I’m about to be married to the CEO I worked for: Luca Steele 💍 but he doesn’t know I was the secretary who worked for him. Neither of us wanted this marriage, arranged before we were even born, but fate doesn't ask for permission. Now I'm caught between duty, secrets, and the man whose cold stare once pierced through me—but whose touch now sets me on fire 🔥🥵.  
  
Chapter 1:  
Lyla Monroe   
“What the heck!?” His voice sliced through the room like a whip. I blinked, heat rising to my cheeks as every eye in the conference room swung to me. My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it. Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who’d just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice. “You’ve worked for me for two years,” he said, each word slow, deliberate, laced with venom. “And you still manage to be a walking disaster. Fix it. Or quit.” No one dared to breathe. The coffee stain spread across the crisp white papers in front of him, slowly bleeding into confidential numbers and contract drafts worth millions. I scrambled forward, grabbing tissues from the tray, muttering apologies that sounded too small, too broken, too pathetic. “I’m sorry, Mr. Steele—” “Sorry doesn’t clean Armani.” He stepped back, brushing off his sleeve with visible disgust. “And what the hell are you wearing?” I froze. His eyes dragged over me. Every inch. My oversized brown cardigan hung off my shoulders like a borrowed curtain. The faded blouse underneath clung to me awkwardly, a button missing near the collar. The olive-green skirt was too long, too wrinkled, and paired horribly with the scuffed, worn-out flats I’d owned since college. My foundation was two shades too pale. My lipstick was crooked. The jet-black wig I wore hung limply around my face, uncombed and clearly fake. And the massive round sunglasses I wore indoors? That was the final punchline. I was a caricature. And everyone knew it. Chuckles rippled softly across the room. “I’m not running a charity,” Luca said, cutting through the silence. “If you can’t show up looking like a professional, then don’t show up at all.” He didn’t wait for a response. He turned his back and walked toward the screen, launching into a presentation like I hadn’t just been stripped of every ounce of dignity in front of ten high-ranking executives. I stood there, cheeks burning, throat tight. And then I turned and walked out. The moment the bathroom door clicked shut behind me, I collapsed into the farthest stall. My hands gripped the toilet seat as sobs wracked my chest. Quiet, sharp, hopeless sobs. I didn’t even care about the coffee anymore. Or the cardigan. Or the snickers in the room. I was just so… tired. Tired of hiding. Tired of pretending. Tired of working ten times harder just to be invisible. I reached into my purse for tissues and caught my reflection in the mirror through the gap in the stall door. God. I did look awful. The glasses had fogged up from my breath. My mascara was smudged beneath the frames. And the wig—it sat like a lifeless animal on my head, tangled, greasy, and suffocating. I buried my face into my hands, trying to breathe. Then—my phone buzzed. LUCA STEELE. I swallowed hard. I wiped my face with toilet paper, fixed my lipstick with shaking fingers, tucked a strand of wig behind my ear, and inhaled once. Twice. By the time I stepped out of the stall, the tears were gone. The mask was back. I walked through the hallway, the same hallway I walked every day, except now it felt like a spotlight was burning holes in me. Two interns passed by, whispering a little too loudly. “She looks like a blind clown.” “I heard she lives in her car.” “She probably has blackmail on him. No way Steele keeps that thing around otherwise.” I didn’t flinch. I didn’t break stride. I never did. Luca’s office loomed ahead, the frosted glass doors tall and foreboding. I stepped in without knocking. He didn’t look up. His office was cold, like everything else about him—monochrome, sharp lines, minimal furniture. But he was the only part of the room that radiated heat. Not warmth—heat. Intensity. Luca Steele, age twenty-nine, CEO of one of the most ruthless corporate empires in the world. Jet-black tousled hair. Perfectly sculpted jawline. That expensive three-day stubble that looked like it belonged on a magazine cover. And those eyes—ice-colored and emotionless.They’d never softened. Not once. I handed him the corrected reports in silence. He barely acknowledged me. “Get me Victoria Ames on the line. And fix the deck from slide 8 onward. It’s sloppy.” “Yes, Mr. Steele.” I turned, heading for the door. My phone rang. I paused, glanced at the screen. Unknown Number. “Hello?” I whispered. A soft voice crackled on the line. “Hi, this is Carla from the reception desk. There’s… um… there’s a man here to see you.” My stomach tightened. “A man?” I said, confused. “Who?” She hesitated. “He gave his name. Said you’d recognize it.” I waited. “Jonathan Kingsley.”

These days?

 You can nail a keyword, write a banger blog post, get that sweet top spot...
 …and still watch your traffic sip espresso somewhere else because Google decided to answer the question itself with AI. 🤖

Oh, and your precious organic link?

 It's now playing hide and seek under a stack of ads, shopping carousels, maps, videos, maybe even a horoscope.

So, here's the existential question I've been asking lately (between panicked CTR reports):

Is the old-school SEO playbook still worth the grind? Or should we be optimizing for brand > bots?

Lately, I’ve been experimenting with:
– Pouring more energy into content people actually see (LinkedIn, IG, the usual suspects)
 – Building email lists and micro-communities that don’t disappear with the next algorithm update
 – Making our brand searchable even when we’re not ranking (branded terms > generic keywords)
 – Using SEO less like a traffic machine and more like a market research intern with unlimited coffee

We might be moving from ""how do I rank?"" to ""how do I matter?""
 And honestly, it’s not a bad shift.

I think i may have pcos? 
I have multiple symptoms that are pointing to pcos but im not sure. 
I have gone to the doctor NUMEROUS times about my weight gain, and the fact that i can NOT lose weight no matter what diet, exercise routine, anything. The only tomes ive lost weight was on meds like topiramate and welbutrin, but welbutrin made me lose my hairline so i gained 30lbs RIGHT back within months. 
I dont eat well, but i wouldnt say i eat terribly compared to other people either. Ive also tried many different eating patterns/diets/fasting etc.
I also crave sweets all the time, i have a huge sweet tooth. 
My periods are always “on time” but when i first had them they were not, then i went on hormonal birth control and that regulated them, but even after i stopped hormonal birth control to switch to the copper iud, my periods kept coming around the same time.
But they are SUPER heavy and EXTREMELY crampy.
Around my ovulation a couple weeks ago i feel to the ground in pain due to really bad cramps specifically on my left side.
I am also tired ALL THE TIME. I am 21 with the energy of an 82 yr old woman. Actually, my 82 year old grandma sleeps less than me. I struggle to stay awake, and i struggle to wake up. Im ALWAYS tired. 
Lastly, my hair never grows, but it sure with grow quite a bit for a female on my lip :/ and my face, shoulders, and chest are covered in acne.

Im just not sure what to do. I brought up this idea to doctors and they said that my “thyroid and hormone levels were fine” but CLEARLY something is wrong, because i am 5’6 and 180lbs, 21yrs old, and nothing i do, no amount of supplements or coffee or celsius will give me energy or make me lose weight. 
I must have some kind of insulin resistance?

1meo6oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1meo6oy/i_found_your_sprite_today/,I found your Sprite today.,"It was in that bag I had the last time we went on a walk outside of the library. Still unopened. It’s been a little over a week since you broke up with me and went no contact because I called you multiple times, drunk, after telling you I’d give you space for the day, begging you to come over because we hadn’t lain in bed and cuddled for a night in a month. I needed you. I know the blowing up part was wrong, and I’ve admitted it. I’ll admit it every day. I just needed you then, and I was plastered. Then I texted you from my backup number id mentioned before when I saw that text because I’d just woken up and it sent my brain into full panic mode before I’d even had a chance to really get it revved up. I didn’t think. I just panic and wanted so badly to fix it. If I could go back I’d never have drank and would have left you alone and woke up to coffee and a smile the next day, and I wouldn’t be writing this now. I’d realize the stress of finding work and my anxiety was pushing you away. I’d realize that even if I never meant to, my always asking you to come over was keeping you from being able to enjoy the things you liked to do and seeing the friends you made. I’d give you more space on the days we weren’t seeing each other. I’d go with you to the marketplace if you wanted me to so you could enjoy time doing something you wanted to do, and not just coming to see me. We’d finish the Good Place. 

I wanted to be there for your HRT. For your top surgery. I wanted to reassure you as you went through that journey that I would still love you because I fell in love with all of you, and no HRT, top surgery, or anything else was going to change that. I wanted to watch the excitement on your face when you finally got your prescription. To take care of you after your surgery. I wanted to move with you somewhere we knew you could do it. I wanted to help you with makeup to feel more masculine. I wanted to help you learn to care for a beard if you grew one since I already have one. I wanted to see you smile getting that job you really wanted. I wanted to hear you sing along in the car on that day trip we never got to take. I wanted to see you clapping for me when I finally got that degree. To one day sign those adoption papers, because you didn’t want biological children. To see you walk down the aisle and have that cord wrapped around our hands. Now I just want a hug from you. Just a hug. 

I know people in your past have hurt you, held things over your head, harassed you, but I’m not them. I know you saw my dropping the things you gave me off with a letter admitting my fault, apologizing again and again, and requesting you to consider giving me a second chance as a harassment. It was never intended to be. I just loved you and wanted to give our relationship more than a ghosting text, and allow myself to heal a little faster without all those wonderful gifts you gave me, that you put so much thought and care into. That’s all. I’ve never wanted to cause you harm, and I never will. I wanted a second chance to show I’d do whatever it took to get over that anxiety so you didn’t feel like you had to question everything, be afraid to say no because I’d get sad, freak out because your “good morning” was different and I must have done something wrong, to feel comfortable when you wanted to have some time to yourself because I’d know you’d come back. I wanted that second chance I gave you when you ran the first time and asked me to forgive you, that you still chose me and it wouldn’t happen again, and I decided you were worth it and I wanted to go all in, because I loved you. It’s why I was terrified the first time I told you, and you lifted a world of weight away when you said you loved me too. It was worth it. It will always have been worth it. I went all in. I just wish I’d thought to go all in on myself then too. 

I’ve missed you at karaoke. I missed our Sunday dinner and cooking for you, and moreso surrounded by my friends, with their partners cuddled up watching Epic. I’ve missed our Wednesdays. I’ll miss you this Sunday beside me at D&D too. 

Rocket misses you too. He’s been so sad since it happened because he knows I have been, but I caught him staring at the door this Wednesday morning and whining right around the time you normally walked in. It broke my heart a little bit more. 

The worst part is, even as I’m going to therapy for that anxious attachment and realizing this isn’t all on me, I’d still take you back in a heartbeat with just a promise to see you working on that avoidance so I didn’t have to worry about you running when things got hard again. Couples counseling so we can address it with an outside source for both of our sakes and comforts. I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol since, and I don’t plan to any time soon. Hell at this point I’d give it up for good since you didn’t drink anyway, if it meant making up for that night. 

In the end, dear soup, I truly hope you’re happy. I hope you’re smiling and feeling the stress my anxiety caused slip away. I hope that our time meant enough that you one day miss me, even just a little bit. I hope it meant enough that I accept you, soup of all kinds. That I always will. 

And if you ever change your mind, you know where to find me. 

I’m still here. I didn’t go anywhere. I still love you. Even if you don’t anymore. ",1,1754026359.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

only thing is, she sucks at communicating. like, texting, calling… things that matter when your long distance… it’s just not there for her. im a person who needs to communicate everyday and it could be about the most random shit, i just like to talk. i told her this but didnt want her to feel like i was forcing her to speak to me every second of the day and she said she’d make an effort to text more often but her texts are so dry it feels unauthentic.. like im texting a coworker or acquaintance. like, i dont want to be like “hey your texts are dry can you add a little more soul to your messages” because thats rude but i feel like im talking to a wet cardboard box sometimes. 

now as a result, after 4 months i feel like i barely know her and its making my skin crawl. don’t get me wrong, i like her a lot not to the point where i feel like im in love due to that disconnect but since im moving near her city, i hope the closer distance can help with our communication and that we can actually spend some quality time together. 

anyway, not sure if this was a rant or not but does anyone have any advice? ",3,1754026244.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

I just ordered a Bambino Plus (remanufactured) directly from Breville for $334 which I thought was a decent deal. I am having an issue where with any grind (very fine to coarse), the coffee shoots out sideways from the portafilter sides and spouts and makes a big mess.

Also, its damn near impossible to get the filters out of mine when the reviewers seem to just pop theirs out, no problem.

When I googled, I noticed that my portafilter actually doesn't even look the same on the bottom compared with the pics on Breville's Bambino Plus webpage and also when watching the reviewers on Youtube. I provided pics here of both mine and the other style of portafilter. Did Breville send me the wrong portafilter u think?

I am a 57 year old man from California and a few other places over the years who is looking for someone, a unique woman, smart and with a touch of sass, fun to spend time with and true to herself and those around her. Introvert like me preferred but not a deal breaker, a woman who enjoys a night in on the couch and a movie, cares about her health, is there for me and knows that I am there for her, looking for the first voice I hear in the morning and the last voice at days end.  Someone to have private jokes with and other things that are ours and ours alone. 

Interests on my end are varied yet simple, I enjoy travel and especially roadtrips, cooking and photography, writing and music, films, reading and coffee, can be found on a nice day off at the beach with my feet in the sand and just enjoying the waves. I am 420 friendly but edibles only as I don’t smoke and rarely drink, aside from the occasional single malt. I am a jeans and t-shirt guy, and more of a casual, laid back guy generally and enjoy a good day at a street fair or just roaming thrift stores or a great garage sale (I always follow those homemade signs and pull over to check it out).. Bonus points for sense of humor and especially fans of puns and Dad jokes, transparency is a big thing with me.

At the end of the day, to quote Page & Plant, “Gotta find the Queen of all my dreams”. 

Someone to connect with and continue to grow with. I completely understand that you only see this as words on  a screen, so let’s chat and see how we vibe and take things from there, naturally and organically and see.. 

Location is not a factor but must be USA/Canada based no exceptions, age is also not a factor be it an age gap or no gap at all, It’s all about who you are as a person, and how we mesh together that matters most to me. 

I am looking to start here then move to something for voice chat once we have chatted here for a bit first. Your DM should tell me about you with age and location and your interests, your picture gets mine in reply.

Her twin.  
The night after graduation, Sierra gave her all to Chase Walker, the school’s hottest bad boy.  
She thought it was love.  
Until she saw the group chat where he proudly showed off their blood-stained bedsheets like a trophy… and laughed about using her as a warm-up before touching the girl he really loved—her twin sister, Maddie.  
Heartbroken.  
Humiliated.  
Destroyed.  
She swallowed emergency pills alone, endured gossip and sl\*t-shaming, and watched as the man she loved showered her sister with public affection.  
But Sierra is done being the fool.  
Now, she’s walking away—with a new university, a new life, and a vow:  
“I will never be anyone’s substitute again.”""  
  
""The moment the SATs were over, I sl\*pt with Chase Walker for the first time.  
In the heat of it all, I gasped out loud—only to hear him whisper a name that wasn’t mine.  
“Maddie…”  
But my name is Sierra. Maddie is my twin sister.  
I blinked, stunned, and looked up at him. “Who did you just say?”  
Chase kept moving, lowering his head to kiss my eyelids. “Sierra,” he murmured, his voice thick, “don’t get distracted. You’re enjoying this, right?”  
His rhythm quickened, driving away every ounce of doubt I had left.  
Chase was a jock—strong, tireless, and always creative. My body trembled uncontrollably beneath him. I tried to push him away. “Don’t…”  
He leaned into my ear, voice hoarse with desire. “Sweetheart, let’s try it on top this time.”  
That night, he wore me down—again and again—until I was crying, begging, shaking, and still he didn’t stop.  
Not until sunrise did he finally stumble into the bathroom, satisfied.  
I lay there, too sore to move, my limbs aching like they didn’t belong to me.  
Then his phone on the nightstand started blowing up with notification pings.  
Instinctively, I glanced at the screen—and froze.  
\[Congrats, Walker! You finally got some last night!\]  
My ticker dropped. I couldn’t stop myself. I unlocked his phone and opened the group chat.  
What I saw made my entire body go numb.  
He’d sent a photo of the bloodstained hotel bedsheet. In the middle of the night.  
The messages came in a flood:  
\[H\*ly crap, Chase—you really did it with Sierra? I thought you were into Maddie?\]  
\[C’mon, they’re twins. Same face, same body. He’s just warming up with Sierra before he goes all in with Maddie. Practice makes perfect, right?\]  
\[Exactly. He’s in love with Maddie. Sierra’s just a stand-in so he doesn’t screw it up with the real thing.\]  
Every word felt like a slap.  
I’d spent hours wondering why Chase liked me. I’d imagined a thousand reasons—none of them this.  
Chase wasn’t just a jock. He was the school's golden boy, surrounded by friends and admiration.  
I was the quiet one. The bookworm everyone ignored.  
We shouldn’t have had anything in common. But one day back in junior year, during gym, I’d accidentally bled through my pants from my period.  
Chase had taken off his team jacket and wrapped it around my waist.  
Since then, he’d left breakfast on my desk every morning. Tucked handwritten notes in my school loker.  
I’d fallen—hard. But I never understood why someone like him would choose someone like me.  
So one day I asked, “What do you like about me?”  
He smiled and said, “Because you’re you.”  
That first love, the kind you believe will last forever—I’d given it my all.  
I thought losing my v\*rginity to him meant something.  
Turns out, it was just a performance. A carefully orchestrated “first time,” for his benefit.  
I clenched my fists so tightly my knuckles turned white, my palms streaked with red. But nothing hurt more than my ticker.  
The water stopped running. I rushed to put his phone back and pretend nothing happened.  
The door opened. Chase walked out, dripping water, a towel slung low on his hips. His tanned skin glistened with drops, muscles sculpted and bare.  
“You’re up. Hungry?”  
He came to the bed, voice gentle, eyes dark with something I couldn’t name. He glanced down at the bruises on my collarbone.  
I couldn’t answer. All I could hear was the echo of his voice last night—calling me Maddie.  
“I’m not hungry.”  
He saw the redness at the corners of my eyes and immediately pulled me into his arms. “Did I hurt you? I didn’t mean to—I just… I was new to this. I’ll get better. We can keep practicing.”  
His hand slid under my shirt again.  
I flinched away. “Don’t. I’m sore.”  
He paused, then slowly smoothed down my wrinkled collar, his voice soft with guilt. “I lost control last night. Have some rest, I’ll go downstairs and grab you breakfast.”  
He got dressed and left.  
I stared at the blood on the white sheets and felt my entire body go hollow.  
For two years, we’d been secretly dating. I’d hidden everything from my teachers, from my friends. I did everything he asked, said yes to everything.  
He wanted Columbia, so I made it my dream too.  
He held my hand under the desk during class; I blushed and kept reciting vocab.  
He asked to meet me behind the field after study hall; I gave him my first kiss.  
Now the exams were over, he wanted a symbolic “rite of passage,” and I gave him everything.  
I thought it was love.  
But it was just rehearsal.  
If Maddie was who he loved from the beginning, then I didn’t want to love him anymore. I didn’t want to be the stand-in.  
I got dressed and left the hotel.  
At a pharmacy down the street, I awkwardly asked the clerk for emergency contraceptive pills.  
She eyed me up and down, frowning, and pulled a box from the shelf. “You should’ve had your boyfriend use protection. These are awful for your body, you know.”  
My face burned. I could barely speak.  
There were condoms in the drawer beside the bed. I’d told Chase to grab a box.  
But he’d just moaned in my ear, red-eyed and desperate.  
“Sierra… it feels weird with that stuff on. Please, just this once. I swear I won’t go too far.”  
I gave in.  
And now here I was, buying back my freedom one pill at a time.  
“Thanks,” I told the clerk as I paid. “Just this once.”  
Never again.  
Never again would I believe anything Chase Walker said.  
I had barely stepped out of the pharmacy when I heard whispers behind me.  
“Just like a h\*\*ker.”  
“She looked so sweet… But...Unbelievable.”  
Their words lashed across my face like a whip, burning hot from my cheeks all the way to my thorax.  
I hurried away, clutching the paper bag, my vision blurring. At the bus stop, I washed down the white pill with a bottle of water.  
I drank too fast. The water caught in my throat, and I started coughing so hard my eyes watered.  
“Sierra!”  
Chase came running up, out of breath, worry etched into every feature.  
“Why’d you leave the hotel without telling me? I texted, I called. Where have you been?”  
The way he said it—like I was the one being cruel—it almost made me laugh.  
Almost.  
But all I felt was this sharp, twisting ache in my thorax.  
“I went to buy emergency contraception,” I said, holding up the now-empty pill box.  
His expression faltered. Embarrassment crept into his eyes.  
“You could’ve told me. Or let me go get it. I was worried.”  
I didn’t want to argue over this. “It won’t happen again.”  
He sensed something was off. He reached for my hand. “I’m sorry I lost control last night. I’ll be more careful next time.”  
Then he smiled. “Hey, the Class President is throwing a graduation party at Capital Square. Come with me?”  
I pulled my hand back. “No one knows we’re together. It’s better if we go separately.”  
Chase stiffened. After a moment, he nodded.  
“Okay. I’ll grab a cab.”  
I didn’t reply. I just got on the next bus.  
He had promised we’d go public after the SATs.  
But for the past few days, while he chatted away in the group chat, not once had he mentioned me.  
And I’d already seen the truth in that secret text thread with his friends.  
There was no relationship to announce.  
By the time I got to the private dining room at Capital Square, the place was packed.  
Maddie, dressed in a pink Lolita-style dress, sat surrounded like some Disney princess. Chase was right next to her, peeling cherries and handing them to her one by one.  
A few classmates started teasing, “Chase, you’ve been so good to the Prom Queen all year. You better shoot your shot before college. Once you get to Columbia, there’ll be too many options!”  
Everyone had seen how good Chase was to Maddie.  
Even though he was secretly dating me, publicly, he was always by Maddie’s side—helping her clean up after class, saving her a spot in the lunch line, carrying her books.  
He was even the one who rallied the guys to vote her Prom Queen.  
But we were twins. We looked almost identical.  
Back then, he’d explained, “Maddie’s got a weaker constitution. People tend to bully her. You’re stronger, Sierra. You have me.”  
I actually believed it. I believed he loved me so much, he was kind to my sister too.  
Looking back now, I was embarrassingly naive. How could I have missed such a lame excuse?  
I pushed the door open and walked in.  
Chase looked up. His expression didn’t change—not even a flicker of guilt.  
Maddie immediately stood and rushed to my side. “Sierra! You didn’t come home last night. Mother and father were freaking out. Where were you?”  
Everyone turned to look at me, whispering behind their drinks.  
“Seriously? Hooking up with someone the night after SATs? Yikes.”  
“Thought she was a brainiac. Guess she’s wild behind the scenes.”  
Maddie wore a look of innocent concern, but her eyes gleamed with satisfaction.  
I saw right through her.  
“It’s none of your business,” I said calmly, trying to walk past her.  
But she latched onto my arm like a loving little sister. “Sit next to me. The seat is available.”  
She tugged a little too hard, and my collar slipped.  
The marks Chase had left on me the night before were on full display—bruised and violet, unmistakable.  
Maddie gasped. “Sierra, what happened to you?”  
Every gaze in the room locked onto me—shocked, curious, judgmental.  
“So much for the innocent honor student…”  
“Jesus, how rough was it? Look at those hickeys.”  
“She’s not even dating anyone, is she? Must’ve been some random hookup after finals.”  
Face burning, I yanked my collar back into place and turned instinctively toward Chase.  
He didn’t even look at me.  
He was still talking with Maddie, his face soft, gentle… like none of this had anything to do with him.  
My ticker hardened.  
“It’s nothing,” I said coolly. “Got bit by a dog. I’m allergic.”  
A worthless stray dog, at that.  
Laughter erupted around the room as everyone joked about which mangy mutt had left those “bite marks” on me.  
Chase’s face darkened. He knocked on the table. “Everyone’s here. Let’s get started.”  
His voice cut through the noise instantly.  
The Class President quickly stood up to ease the awkwardness. “Yeah, enjoy yourself. We’ll all be heading our separate ways soon—college, work, wherever. Might be the last time we’re all in the same room.”  
People started sharing their summer plans.  
Some were heading south for factory jobs. Some had graduation trips booked. Others were rushing to get their driver’s licenses.  
Dinner wrapped up, and the party moved into a private karaoke lounge.  
We played games. One of them was a dare.  
Maddie got picked and had to choose a guy to give her a princess carry for a full minute.  
The guys immediately started cheering. Maddie blushed and glanced at Chase. “Chase, can you help me?”  
Without a word, Chase leaned down, one arm slipping behind her knees, muscles flexing as he lifted her effortlessly into the air.  
“Hold on tight.”  
Maddie let out a soft gasp, wrapping her arms around his neck, her laughter sugary-sweet.  
“Blast, Walker’s a beast! No wonder he’s on varsity!”  
I looked away, curling my fingers into fists beneath the table. I tried to pretend it didn’t bother me.  
Then it was my turn.  
The dare? Take three shots of vodka—or kiss any guy in the room.  
The guys all grinned, already whispering.  
I instinctively glanced at Chase.  
He avoided my eyes.  
“I already played knight tonight,” he said flatly. “I’m sitting out the rest.”  
The words hit like a slap.  
I picked up the shot glass and knocked it back.  
Then another.  
Then another.  
The vodka burned down my throat like acid. My eyes stung. I stumbled out of the room and into the bathroom, barely making it to the sink before throwing it all up.  
I splashed water on my face, rinsed my mouth over and over until the burning eased.  
When I looked up, the mirror showed a mess.  
Red eyes. Hair tangled. Collar askew, with faint bruises peeking out beneath the fabric.  
I looked like a clown.  
I tugged my clothes straight, brushed out my hair, and gave myself the most pathetic smile I could muster.  
“Sierra Hayes,” I whispered, “pain teaches you lessons. You’ll be better because of this. Pull youself together.”  
I didn’t go back into the room.  
I texted the Class President that I was heading home and left.  
On the bus, I pulled out my phone and opened our old iMessage thread.  
\[Sierra, I like you. Will you be my girlfriend?\]  
\[Sierra, I couldn’t sleep again tonight. I kept thinking about you. I miss you.\]  
Dozens of sweet nothings. Dozens of selfies—Chase posing with his bike, dunking at the school court, us walking to school in our Westhaven High uniforms.  
When I got a new phone last year, I refused to delete any of it.  
But now…  
With trembling fingers, I selected the entire chat.  
6.9 GB. Delete?  
Yes.  
Everything we had—all our memories, all his empty words—were gone with a tap.  
It was like we were never anything at all.  
The bus pulled to a stop. I wiped my face and stood up.  
I walked home.  
The second I stepped through the front door, a sharp slap knocked me to the floor.  
My ears rang.  
“You shameless brat!” my father roared. “Staying out all night and drinking like some party girl? ”  
Half my face throbbed with heat. My head spun as I looked up from the floor—only to see Maddie and mother sitting on the couch, watching it all with smug satisfaction.  
I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth.  
“The Class President threw the party,” I rasped. “I only had a little, and I threw it all up. Maddie can vouch for me.”  
But Maddie blinked, all innocence. “He did throw the party, but Sierra left halfway without saying anything. I can’t back her up.”  
Mother’s face hardened.  
“Sierra Hayes, how many times have I told you to learn from your sister? If you do, your father wouldn’t be this upset.”  
I knelt on the floor, my cheek red and swollen.  
They sat hand in hand on the sofa. Picture perfect.  
My eyes drifted to the coffee table.  
There sat a vacation contract: “Westhaven Students Celebrate SAT Success – 3-Person Family Trip to Cancun!”  
My ticker dropped.  
My parents’ names were signed. So was Maddie’s.  
“You’re taking Maddie on a trip… and leaving me behind?” I asked.  
Mother’s eyes flickered. “Maddie won it in a school raffle. There are only three spots. We’re going with her because it’s fair.",1,1754025911.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Within a week, I was 10 applications deep, 0 responses, and 1 existential crisis away from switching careers to alpaca farming.

Then I realized — maybe the problem wasn’t me.  
Maybe it was my resume looking like it was written by a sleep-deprived raccoon in Times New Roman size 11.

That’s when I found [ProResumeHelp](https://essay.watch/t9NDL4?type=7) — and damn, I wish I’d stumbled across it sooner.

# What Is ProResumeHelp?

It’s not just another resume writing service that spits out generic, copy-paste CVs.  
It’s a small team of real humans (shocker, right?) that actually tailor your resume to your goals — and they know their stuff.

They help with:

* Student & entry-level resumes
* Career change CVs
* Academic CVs
* Cover letters & LinkedIn optimization
* And yes, those annoying ""motivational letters"" that nobody wants to write

They even do ATS-optimized resumes — aka your golden ticket to getting past the bots.

# How Ordering Works (And Why It’s Surprisingly Chill)

If the idea of filling out a form stresses you out, breathe.  
Here's how it goes:

1. Go to [**ProResumeHelp.org**](https://essay.watch/t9NDL4?type=7)
2. Choose your service — resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, or the full glow-up package.
3. Fill out a short form (just the basics — no essays)

5. Their writer reaches out for clarification or details
6. Boom — your first draft arrives in 1–2 business days.

# Why It’s One of the Best Resume Writing Services for Students

Let’s keep it real: Most students either  
a) use a free resume template from 2006

c) overthink every word and give up halfway

This team gets it. They’re not out here using generic jargon or making you sound like an AI chatbot. They pull out your actual strengths, even if you think “I worked at Starbucks for a summer” isn’t impressive (spoiler: they’ll make it sound like you ran a multinational coffee empire). And unlike the “big name” resume mills, they actually take time to understand your story — without charging $300 for it.

# What Makes ProResumeHelp Different?

For two years, I lived in the shadows of our ""relationship,"" watching him play knight in shining armor for Rosalia while treating me like I was invisible. I thought it was love. It was just humiliation.

Chapter 1  
  
  
The night after our SATs ended, Luigi took my V-card.  
  
  
In the heat of passion, I couldn't help but let out a soft moan, only to hear him whisper ""Rosalia.""  
  
  
But my name is Aurelia Cooper, and Rosalia is my twin sister.  
  
  
I looked at Luigi uncertainly. ""Who did you just call?""  
  
  
""Aurelia,"" Luigi said without missing a beat, leaning down to kiss my eyelids. ""Getting distracted right now? What, am I not doing this right?""  
  
  
His movements became more aggressive, wiping away all my doubts.  
  
  
Luigi was our school's star hockey player—not only skilled in technique but also blessed with seemingly endless stamina.  
  
  
Wave after wave of sensation hit me as I weakly pushed against his chest.  
  
  
""Stop... please...""  
  
  
He pressed his lips to my ear, voice rough. ""Baby, let's try you on top.""  
  
  
All night long, he had me every which way, flipping me around despite my tears and begging for breaks.  
  
  
It wasn't until sunrise that he finally rolled off, satisfied, and headed to the shower.  
  
  
I lay there completely wrecked, feeling like I'd been hit by a truck.  
  
  
That's when his phone on the nightstand started going off like crazy.  
  
  
Luigi's phone. I glanced over and saw a Snapchat notification pop up.  
  
  
Yooo Luigi finally got his dick wet last night!  
  
  
My stomach dropped. I couldn't help myself—I grabbed his phone and opened Snapchat.  
  
  
When I scrolled through the group chat with his hockey teammates, I froze in shock.  
  
  
In the middle of the night, Luigi had actually sent a photo of our bloodstained sheets to the team group chat!  
  
  
Below the photo was a string of messages—  
  
  
Tyler\_Hockey23: No fucking way bro, you actually banged Aurelia Cooper? Thought you were obsessed with her sister Rosalia?  
  
  
JakeIce99: Dude you're missing the point. They're identical twins—same face, same body. Luigi's just using Aurelia for target practice, you know? Getting his technique down before he goes after Rosalia so he doesn't mess it up with his real crush.  
  
  
Marcus\_Puck: Smart move. Rosalia's wifey material. Better to break in that virgin dick on the practice dummy first, then he'll know how to treat a queen right...  
  
  
BradSticks: Bet Aurelia was tight as fuck though. Lucky bastard.  
  
  
Tyler\_Hockey23: Think she knows she's just the warm-up act? ?  
  
  
Each disgusting message felt like a knife to my chest, leaving me completely numb.  
  
  
I'd imagined a million reasons why Luigi might want me, but never this.  
  
  
Luigi wasn't just our hockey captain—he was Mr. Popular, friends with everyone. Meanwhile, I was the quiet nerd that teachers loved and most students ignored.  
  
  
Our personalities were completely different who should never have crossed paths.  
  
  
But during sophomore year, I had an accident during morning assembly—my period started unexpectedly and stained my pants. Luigi wrapped his hockey jersey around my waist.  
  
  
After that, he started leaving coffee and pastries on my desk every morning, with sweet notes tucked in my textbooks.  
  
  
Young love began blooming in my heart, but I never understood why Luigi would single me out.  
  
  
I once asked him, ""Why me?""  
  
  
He said, ""Because you're Aurelia Cooper.""  
  
  
Teenage love—I had bet my entire seventeenth spring and eighteenth summer on it.  
  
  
I'd snuck around with him, broken all the rules, given him my V-card, thinking it was the start of something real.  
  
  
Turns out I was just his practice round.  
  
  
I gripped the phone so hard my knuckles went white, but the physical pain was nothing compared to my shattered heart.  
  
  
The shower turned off. I quickly closed the app and put his phone back.  
  
  
The bathroom door opened and Luigi walked out with just a towel around his waist, water droplets running down his chest and abs.  
  
  
""Morning, beautiful. You hungry?""  
  
  
He sat on the bed edge and brushed hair from my face, his eyes lingering on the hickeys covering my neck and collarbone.  
  
  
Looking at him, all I could think about was how he'd moaned ""Rosalia"" while he was inside me.  
  
  
""I'm not hungry.""  
  
  
Luigi noticed my red-rimmed eyes and pulled me against his chest.  
  
  
""Shit, did I go too hard last night? Look, that was my first time too—I'm still learning the ropes. But hey, practice makes perfect, right? The more we do it, the better I'll get at making you feel good.""  
  
  
His hands started wandering under my shirt, clearly ready for round two.  
  
  
I couldn't stand him touching me anymore, knowing I was just his training wheels. I shoved his hands away.  
  
  
""Don't. I'm sore.""  
  
  
Luigi withdrew his hands, looking apologetic as he smoothed down my wrinkled shirt.  
  
  
""You're right, I got carried away. Rest up—I'll grab us some breakfast and maybe take a cold shower while I'm at it.""  
  
  
After getting dressed, he left the hotel room.  
  
  
Staring at that crimson stain on the white sheets, I felt completely hollow inside.  
  
  
For two years of secret dating, I'd hidden from teachers and classmates, bending over backward to make Luigi happy.  
  
  
When he set his sights on Boston University, I made it my dream school too.  
  
  
When he wanted to hold hands under our desks during class, I'd blush and intertwine our fingers while pretending to take notes.  
  
  
When he wanted to make out behind the gym after study hall, I'd sneak out and let him kiss me breathless.  
  
  
And when he said he wanted to celebrate the end of high school properly, I followed him to this hotel and gave him my V-card.  
  
  
I thought our epic first love would last forever.  
  
  
I never expected this betrayal coming.  
  
  
Since he'd been playing me from day one, planning to trade up to Rosalia all along, I wouldn't follow behind him like a lost puppy either.  
  
  
I got dressed and left the hotel, finding a pharmacy on the street corner where I awkwardly asked the pharmacist for Plan B.  
  
  
She looked me up and down with obvious judgment before pulling the box from behind the counter.  
  
  
""Honey, why didn't your boyfriend use protection? These pills aren't good for young women.""  
  
  
My face burned with shame and embarrassment.  
  
  
There had been condoms right there in the hotel nightstand.  
  
  
Last night I'd tried to get Luigi to use one, but he'd bitten my neck and kept grinding against me，his eyes red with desire.  
  
  
""Aurelia, come on, those things kill the mood. I'm dying here—just let me feel you, please? I swear I'll pull out.""  
  
  
But my moment of compromise had led to this bitter pill.  
  
  
I paid for the Plan B and thanked her.  
  
  
""This is a one-time thing.""  
  
  
I would never believe Luigi's bullshit again.  
  
  
And I wouldn't let him hurt me anymore.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
I hadn't even stepped out of the pharmacy when I heard women behind me talking shit.  
  
  
""Kids these days have zero self-respect.""  
  
  
""She looks so innocent, but buying Plan B at eighteen? What a little slut.""  
  
  
Their words felt like acid being poured over my skin, burning from my face straight down to my soul.  
  
  
I practically ran to the bus stop, hands shaking as I dry-swallowed the white pill with bottled water.  
  
  
The water went down wrong and I started choking, coughing so violently that tears poured down my cheeks. Everything hurt—my throat, my chest, my fucking heart.  
  
  
""Aurelia!""  
  
  
Luigi came sprinting toward me, panic written all over his face.  
  
  
""What the hell? Why'd you bail from the hotel? I've been blowing up your phone—are you seriously gonna ghost me after what we did?""  
  
  
He had the audacity to look wounded, like I was the one being shitty here.  
  
  
I wanted to scream, to laugh, to do anything but stand there feeling like my chest was caving in.  
  
  
""I was getting Plan B."" I waved the empty box at him.  
  
  
His expression shifted, guilt flashing across his features for maybe half a second.  
  
  
""Shit, you should've told me. I would've handled it. Had me thinking you were having second thoughts or something.""  
  
  
I was too emotionally drained to fight about this. ""Whatever. It's done.""  
  
  
Luigi must have noticed I looked like death because he reached for my hand. ""Look, I got carried away last night. Next time I'll be more careful, okay?""  
  
  
""Tyler's throwing a graduation party at Copper & Flame. We should head over.""  
  
  
I jerked my hand back like he'd burned me.  
  
  
""We're not public yet, remember? Better if we show up separately. Don't want people talking.""  
  
  
Luigi's whole body went rigid. After what felt like forever, he nodded stiffly.  
  
  
""Yeah... yeah, good point. I'll grab a ride.""  
  
  
I turned away and got on the first bus that pulled up, not trusting myself to look at him again.  
  
  
Luigi had sworn we'd go official after graduation. But here we were, days later, and he was chatting up a storm in every group chat except mentioning anything about us.  
  
  
The truth from his hockey team's messages had made everything crystal clear anyway.  
  
  
This relationship was never meant to see the light of day.  
  
  
By the time I made it to Copper & Flame, the private dining room was already packed with our entire graduating class.  
  
  
And there was Rosalia, dolled up in some frilly pink dress, holding court in the center of the room while Luigi sat right beside her, literally hand-feeding her grapes.  
  
  
I felt physically sick.  
  
  
Some of the guys started razzing him: ""Bro, graduation's in like two days. You've been simping for our class princess forever—when you gonna grow some balls and ask her out? College is gonna be a whole different game, man!""  
  
  
Luigi's obsession with Rosalia was common knowledge to everyone except, apparently, me.  
  
  
While he was secretly screwing me, he was publicly playing her knight in shining armor—cleaning up after her, buying her lunch, fighting anyone who looked at her wrong.  
  
  
Hell, he's the one who campaigned to get her voted class beauty in the first place.  
  
  
We were identical twins. We had the same face, same body, same everything.  
  
  
When I'd questioned him about it before, his bullshit excuse was:  
  
  
""Babe, your sister looks just like you but she's fragile, you know? If I don't watch out for her, jealous people might target her. But you're different—you're strong. You have me.""  
  
  
God, I'd actually bought that garbage. Thought he was being protective because he loved me so much.  
  
  
Looking back, I wanted to punch my naive teenage self in the face.  
  
  
I steeled myself and pushed through the door.  
  
  
Luigi saw me walk in and didn't even have the decency to look guilty. Just kept playing the perfect gentleman with Rosalia.  
  
  
She immediately bounced over to me, putting on her innocent little sister act.  
  
  
""Aurelia! Oh my God, where were you last night? You didn't come home and Mom and Dad were freaking out!""  
  
  
Every head in the room turned toward me, whispers starting immediately.  
  
  
""Holy shit, staying out all night right after graduation? She definitely got laid.""  
  
  
""I always thought Aurelia was this total nerd, but turns out she's a closet freak...""  
  
  
Faced with their gossip, Rosalia looked secretly pleased.  
  
  
I caught her expression and replied with ice in my voice, ""None of your business.""  
  
  
I tried to find an empty seat away from the circus, but Rosalia grabbed my arm with fake sisterly concern.  
  
  
""Don't be weird, sit with me!""  
  
  
She yanked me toward her with way more force than necessary, and my shirt collar shifted, exposing every single hickey Luigi had sucked into my skin last night.  
  
  
Rosalia gasped dramatically like she'd just discovered a crime scene. ""Aurelia, what are those marks?!""  
  
  
The entire room went dead silent, then exploded with whispers.  
  
  
""No fucking way, look at her neck!""  
  
  
""Jesus Christ, someone went to town on her. How many are there?""  
  
  
""Who knew the class nerd was such a slut? Bet she just grabbed some random guy for her graduation fuck.""  
  
  
Humiliation burned through me as I frantically pulled my shirt back up. My eyes found Luigi automatically, desperately hoping for... what? Support? Acknowledgment?  
  
  
He was meticulously peeling a fucking orange for Rosalia, acting like I didn't exist.  
  
  
Something inside me finally snapped.  
  
  
""It's nothing,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady. ""Got bit by a dog last night. Allergic reaction.""  
  
  
A heartless, lying piece of shit dog.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Everyone burst out laughing, making crude jokes about which random street guy the ""dog"" might have been.  
  
  
Luigi's face went dark, and he slammed his hand on the table. ""Alright, everyone's here. Let's order.""  
  
  
Once he spoke, nobody dared keep running their mouths. Tyler jumped in to smooth things over.  
  
  
""He's right. After tonight we'll all be scattered across the country. Let's eat and catch up while we can.""  
  
  
Everyone started sharing their summer plans—some heading out of state for work, others planning road trips or getting their licenses.  
  
  
After dinner, we hit up the pool hall next door.  
  
  
During a game, Rosalia got dared to let one of the guys lift her onto the pool table and spin her around.  
  
  
The guys started hooting, and Rosalia looked shyly at Luigi. ""Luigi, could you do me a favor?""  
  
  
Luigi's jaw clenched before he set down his cue stick. Without warning, he grabbed her waist and effortlessly lifted her onto the felt, spinning her in a slow circle.  
  
  
""Hold on tight,"" he murmured, way too intimate for my comfort.  
  
  
Rosalia giggled and grabbed his shoulders for support, practically melting into him.  
  
  
The guys went wild: ""Damn, Luigi! Those hockey muscles aren't just for show!""  
  
  
Watching this pathetic display, I dug my nails into my palms and forced myself to look away, trying to pretend I didn't exist.  
  
  
Naturally, the next dare picked me. I had to either take three shots of tequila or make out with one of the guys for thirty seconds.  
  
  
All the guys were grinning like wolves as I automatically looked toward Luigi.  
  
  
He was still standing close to Rosalia, deliberately avoiding my eyes.  
  
  
""I already did my good deed tonight. I'm out.""  
  
  
His dismissal felt like being gutted with a rusty knife.  
  
  
Fuck it.  
  
  
I grabbed the first shot and threw it back, then the second, then the third. The alcohol burned like acid down my throat, and tears streamed down my face before I could stop them.  
  
  
I barely made it to the bathroom before throwing up everything.  
  
  
After splashing cold water on my face and rinsing out my mouth, I finally looked in the mirror.  
  
  
Bloodshot eyes, smeared makeup, hair a disaster, hickeys still visible on my neck. I looked like I'd been hit by a truck.  
  
  
I tried to fix myself up and forced a smile at my reflection.  
  
  
""Aurelia, pain makes you stronger. You'll get through this...""  
  
  
I couldn't go back in there. I texted Tyler that I was heading home and escaped.  
  
  
On the bus, I opened my phone and scrolled through two years of messages with Luigi.  
  
  
Aurelia, I'm so into you. Will you be my girlfriend?  
  
  
Can't sleep again. All I can think about is you. Miss you so much.  
  
  
There were hundreds of photos too—him showing off on his bike, scoring goals at hockey practice, selfies of us together at school.  
  
  
I'd transferred all of this to every new phone, treasuring every word and image.  
  
  
Now, with trembling fingers, I selected all 6.9GB of our history and hit delete.  
  
  
Two years of love—erased.  
  
  
Like it never happened. Like we never happened.  
  
  
When I got home, I barely made it through the front door before Dad's hand connected with my face, sending me sprawling.  
  
  
""You worthless little slut! Out all night, then coming home reeking of alcohol—have you lost your goddamn mind?""  
  
  
Half my face exploded in pain. Through watery eyes, I saw Rosalia and Mom on the couch, watching my humiliation like it was entertainment.  
  
  
""It was just a graduation party,"" I said, tasting blood. ""I barely drank anything and threw it up. Rosalia was there—she can tell you.""  
  
  
Rosalia's eyes went wide with fake innocence. ""Well, there was a party, but Aurelia disappeared halfway through. I have no idea where she went after that.""  
  
  
""Graduation was literally five days ago and she's already acting like a complete slut. Do you want the whole neighborhood thinking we raised a whore?""  
  
  
Her words were gasoline on Dad's rage. Mom's face twisted with disgust.  
  
  
""Aurelia, we've told you a thousand times to follow your sister's example. If you had an ounce of Rosalia's class, your father wouldn't be losing his mind right now.""  
  
  
I stayed on the floor, blood dripping from my split lip, my cheek on fire.  
  
  
Looking at them cuddled together on the couch made me want to vomit again.  
  
  
A travel brochure on the coffee table caught my eye: Post-Graduation Bali Family Trip for Three.  
  
  
All three signatures were already there—Dad, Mom, Rosalia.  
  
  
""You're taking her to Bali? Without me?""  
  
  
Mom wouldn't meet my eyes. ""Rosalia won this in a contest at school. Only three spots available—naturally we're going with her.""  
  
  
""You can stay home and think about your choices. Maybe next time there'll be room for you too.""  
  
  
I laughed, bitter and broken. ""Next time? When the hell is next time?""  
  
  
Rosalia had been born premature and sickly—doctors blamed me for ""stealing her nutrients"" in the womb. Ever since, Mom and Dad treated her like she was made of glass and me like I was some kind of parasite.  
  
  
Growing up, every prize I won, every toy I loved, had to be handed over the second Rosalia showed interest.  
  
  
Dinner was always ""let your sister eat first,"" birthday parties were ""we'll celebrate yours next weekend,"" Christmas presents were ""share with Rosalia, be a good big sister.""  
  
  
""Next time"" never fucking came.  
  
  
When Mom stayed silent, Dad raised his hand again.  
  
  
""Keep running your mouth and see what happens! Get upstairs and don't come down until you've learned some respect!""  
  
  
I dragged myself to my room, everything inside me screaming.  
  
  
My phone buzzed with a text from my homeroom teacher.  
  
  
Aurelia, come in tomorrow morning to go over your scores. We need to talk college applications.  
  
  
Sure, I typed back, curling into a ball on my bed.  
  
  
College was my ticket out of this nightmare. My chance to disappear.  
  
  
The next morning I went straight to school and reviewed my test answers with Mr. Miller.  
  
  
After calculating my projected scores, he lit up with pride.  
  
  
""These are incredible, Aurelia. I remember you talking about Boston University—with numbers like these, you could get into any program you want.""  
  
  
""I've got their admissions packet right here. Take it home and start planning your future.""  
  
  
His enthusiasm made my chest tight with guilt.  
  
  
I'd only wanted Boston University because of Luigi. Now I needed to think about saving myself.  
  
  
""Actually, Mr. Miller, I want to apply to New Mexico Tech's government research program.""  
  
  
I was going to leave this house I'd been trapped in for eighteen years, and leave Luigi too.  
  
  
Get as far away from all of them as possible...

**Design and Detailing:** The design and detailing of an antique mirror tray are crucial to its overall aesthetic appeal. Many trays feature intricate metalwork, such as filigree patterns, floral motifs, or geometric designs, that are carefully crafted and frequently enough finished with an antique gold, silver, or copper patina.

Some trays also include decorative handles, feet, or rims that add to their elegance and functionality, making them easy to carry and stable on various surfaces.**Weight Capacity:** While primarily decorative, antique mirror trays are often used for serving and displaying various items, so weight capacity is an important consideration. High-quality trays are designed to support a reasonable amount of weight without buckling or bending.

Manufacturers often specify the maximum weight capacity, so it's important to check this before loading the tray with heavy items to prevent damage or accidents.

**Maintenance and Care:** Antique mirror trays require regular maintenance to keep them looking their best. The mirrored surface can easily show fingerprints, smudges, and dust, so it's important to clean it regularly with a soft, lint-free cloth and a gentle glass cleaner. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the reflective coating and the metal finish.

We got her as a friend to my other cat (older cat is 3 y.o, kitten is now 5-6 months old) and she is sooo hyper - running around all day, knocking stuff down, biting and destroying my plants, but this I can live with. She is annoying, but it's kitten behavior. However, she hasn't let us get a good sleep for some time now and it's taking a toll. Each day at around 6am she'd come up to the bedroom door and start meowing nonstop until someone gets up. We've tried playtime before bed, ignoring her, giving her food, yelling, spray bottle - nothing works. In fact, when I get the spray bottle, she starts running around and chirping like it's a game (she doesn't like water, so I guess it's the attention she likes) *It is* almost time to spay her, idk if that'll change anything?  
She does this most likely as she wants to spend time with us, cause the moment I get up from bed and sit down to work/drink coffee, she starts napping nearby. 

Older cat is as annoyed as us - they do playfight together, but most of the time she's annoyed and wants peace and quiet. When small kitten first started doing this, we'd hear older cat ""disciplining her"" but I guess she gave up lol

We're at our wits' end, and as much as I don't want to, rehoming her to a place with a yard becomes a possible option as days go by. I'm looking for any advice to solve this situation before that so I don't feel like a horrible person. ",1,1754024495.0,CATHELP,5,1.0,False

1menmzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1menmzp/newbie_looking_for_advice_on_first_machine_300/,Newbie looking for advice on first machine [$300],"I'm finally looking to move on from my Nespresso and get a regular espresso machine. I absolutely love my Nespresso but the capsules are so expensive and I'm looking to get away from the aluminum and plastic. Looking for something super easy as I've never used an espresso machine before. Here are some things I'm looking for or how I intend to use it. 

- easy to use
- semi affordable, would like to stay under $300
- 99% of the time this will be used for iced lattes with 1 or 2 shots, no more than that. 
- I drink one cup of coffee or latte a day, almost everyday, maybe 2 on the weekends if my husband has one as well. 
- would love for mostly stainless steel/least amount of plastic as possible. 
- not a deal breaker but would love something quick and quiet if possible because I have young kids and sometimes I'm in a mad dash to make my coffee before they wake up and need to eat. 
- also not a deal breaker but my coffee bar is not very deep so bonus points if it's compact, for example I have to angle my nespresso sideways to fit on the bar. 

I'm currently debating between the Breville Bambino and the Delonghi ECP3630 but open to other options as well. I just generally feel like a big name brand is a safer bet but again, I'm open to hearing about others. 

I only have two other unrelated questions. First, are there general good holidays sales on these/would it be worth it to wait a few months? And second, will buying ground espresso be ok or is it worth it to buy whole bean and a grinder? And if so, which grinder is your favorite?

29 yo female
5’3”, 120 lbs
Moderately active
No smoking
Taking trileptal, vyvanse,  trazodone, sumatriptan as needed for migraine
1 - 2 cups of coffee per day

 Over the past several years, I’ve noticed I frequently have episodes where I have an uncomfortable sensation of not being able to breathe in fully. This then leads to my trying harder and harder to take a deep breath, and I often end up swallowing air and then becoming bloated, which makes the shortness of breath worse. These episodes occur often but not exclusively before, during and after migraines. Seasonal allergies also seem to trigger and exacerbate the episodes.

Other triggers include certain positions such as sitting straight up, tight bras (sometimes any bra at all), eating, heat, and high waisted pants.

I never wheeze or gasp for breath during the episodes; it’s just a feeling of not quite having enough air. The episodes last for 30 minutes to several days; sometimes I wake up with the sensation, especially if I went to bed with it the night before.

Oddly, whatever this is seems to improve with exercise. Exercise does not always fully resolve it, but it reduces the intensity. Sexual activity also seems to resolve it, I imagine because like exercise it increases my heart rate.

Lastly, I do sometimes wake up at night gasping for breath, and once during the day this happened. I will be following up with my pcp about this.

That said… I’m also on a budget, so I don’t want to spend a fortune. 😅

Would love your thoughts:

* Any affordable brands or models you'd recommend?

Stainless steel options are frequently enough vacuum-insulated, keeping drinks cold for hours and preventing condensation. Plastic cups should be BPA-free and sturdy enough to withstand repeated use and washing. Glass cups should be tempered for added strength and safety.

This feature is essential for outdoor events, ensuring your drink stays refreshing throughout the game.

**Size and Capacity:** 49ers cups come in various sizes, from small travel mugs to large tumblers. Choose a size that suits your needs. Smaller cups (12-16 oz) are ideal for personal use, while larger cups (20-30 oz) are better for staying hydrated throughout the day or sharing with friends. The right capacity depends on your personal preferences and intended use.

My husband and I recently moved to Cali and started shopping at Aldi. I only drink iced coffee, and he said he’d make his own at home so each week I’d buy a bottle for myself to last the week, plus an occasional energy drink or two as a pre-workout.

But week after week, he would finish his homemade coffee and then drink mine too…..even though I asked him every time at the store if he wanted his own. He’d always say no.

Eventually I suggested we each have our own labeled bottle. He agreed and then still drank all of his and dipped into mine which meant I wouldn’t have enough to make it the week. So I started buying myself an extra energy drink to drink less coffee to ration out, and he drank that too.

We’ve had this same conversation every single week for the past two months. I keep asking him not to drink mine. I keep trying to plan ahead. And every week, he drinks his and mine. We started buying one bottle each and a shared bottle. I still wouldn’t get to drink a week’s worth of coffee since he’d essentially drink 2+ bottles. 

Today, he told me at 9pm that we were out of coffee but that I could drink an energy drink I had left. No offense to anyone who does this, but the idea of having an Alani at 8am is not it. I’ve told him I cannot drink an energy drink in the morning MANY times. I chewed him out for drinking my stuff. Now he wants me to apologize.

He’s ignoring me now and leaves for a 5 day trip in the morning. I don’t want to apologize considering this is not the first, second, third, or even fourth time he’s done this.

Besides this, he’s a great husband. I know in the grand scheme of things this doesn’t really matter, but I’m annoyed af and just want to drink my morning coffee!!!

1menbp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1menbp8/ava_cancunmixed_experience/,AVA Cancun…mixed experience,"My wife and I bought paradise passes last year at Hard Rock Cancun during our honeymoon. One of the big highlights was the soon to be opening “5-diamond” resort AVA.

We used the passes this week for a family vacation and it was honestly not worth what we spent. I’ll publish the bill later and explain the cost, but it’s important to note that you can save yourself almost 1/2-1/3 of the cost by buying directly with a travel site/agent.

Food

The overall food quality was better than HardRock Cancun by a lot, however there were several challenges.

There are two buffets at either end of the resort. While they mirror each other the South Tower buffet was completely mismanaged. Food would run out constantly, the stations weren’t labeled and often the staff didn’t seem to know what their specific station was. We ended up ordering bacon from the waiter because it was literally never available. I also ordered orange juice two times and both times it came out extremely sour, as if the rinds had been ground into the juice.

The coffee bars were decent but incomplete, meant to have pastries and breakfast sandwiches but all the food areas were half empty, or worse the cooler wasn’t working.

The soft serve ice cream place was broken half the trip due to power issues, on the last day it finally was working and was decent.

All the restaurants were good, but their most popular restaurant which was “Black Iron” steakhouse was so small it was impossible to book. We did hibachi and Italian and enjoyed both, however the wine selection at the Italian place was pretty bad and bottles were insanely overpriced. Could buy several of them at American grocery stores for under $15 and were listed above $200.

Spa
The spa was clearly where they had invested the most. It was a massive space and the massages we got were great, albeit overpriced. They have something like 30+ rooms for individuals, couples and the full hydrotherapy/sauna experience looked amazing. We didn’t do anything too elaborate but a 50 minute massage was $250-$300 and a couples massage was $500+. I would have expected a better experience for that price but we used resort credits and it wasn’t bad after discounts.

Pools

There are four areas of the pool. A small family friendly pool at the north end that constantly smelled like shit because of the massive amount of seaweed (I hope) that was plaguing the area this summer. 

A kids water park and wading pool that was really nice, but was unfortunately close enough to the beach to have a mosquito problem. 

The massive main pool which is divided into sub sections. The main pool is so large they let you kayak or paddle board around and have an inflatable playground anchored in it. This section is roped off from the rest, which overall was cool. There’s also a small legend club pool slightly above the main pool, however it’s so small that the water was super warm and not very enjoyable. The main issue with the main pool is the lack of any material shade and accessibility. Along the building they have small outdoor buffets but the pool is blocked by a glass fence almost the entire length. You either have to cross one of the three bridges or find one of the small ladders to get into it, or you end up waking quite a bit. The pool hours are also limited to 9 AM- 6 PM, which during summer is kind of a bust as it’s more enjoyable in their afternoon/early evening but is already shutdown.

The last section is an adults only area. It looked nice from my balcony but I didn’t check it out as I was traveling with my two kids.

Overall experience

The resort is just not finished and should really not be fully opened yet. All over the resort there were cosmetic issues, lack of complete drywall, missing paint, poor patch jobs. Almost every thermostat on my floor had an overly large hole in the wall and exposed wiring. 

During my five day stay the resort lost power 6-8 times. The whole resort, not just sections or my room, quite literally the whole thing. We lost power while in the escape room which was a bit more entertaining but also hilariously bad.

There’s a ton of dead space or unused areas still being figured out. We watched them build what I think was a crepe or waffle shop over the week but it never opened and never had any signage.

There’s massive patio space outside along the building but no furniture, and no shade. The pool furniture is fully decked out but they have more chairs than umbrellas as well.

The Kids section was probably my son’s highlight, they did labs and had activities most of the day, as well as a large play space for kids. This was a really cool feature and free of cost.

Every other “activity” came at additional expense. Bowling, f1 simulator, escape rooms were all extra. 

In summary, if you get a good deal (under 2k) this is a decent place to visit with a lot of potential, but for what we paid and all the alleged perks of the paradise pass, it was a rip off and a disappointing experience. Between this and the underwhelming experience during our Honeymoon, I will avoid booking with RCD Hotels in the future.",0,1754023369.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,0.5,False

Unfortunately my smart bulbs aren't working so I'm stuck with this light temperature but its okay. Ignore the trash bag under the plant I forgot to buy a drip tray lol.

Not like—“what’s your favorite color” knew you,
not like—“how do you take your coffee” knew you.   



I knew you.
Soul-level.
Ribcage-splitting.
Name-what-hurts-without-words kind of knowing.



I saw it—
the chaos you carry like a second skin,
the way your smile didn’t quite reach your eyes
but your eyes…
they told the whole damn story.



I saw the cracks in your armor
and didn’t flinch.
Didn’t turn away.
Didn’t try to fix.
I stayed.



I loved you.



Not the Instagram-filtered version of you,
but the mid-breakdown, mascara-streaked,
""I don't know why I sabotage everything"" version.
The you who pushed and pulled at once.
The you who was all fire and fear and
“please don’t leave—but don’t get too close.”



And God, I did.
I loved you.
So much,
it carved a home in me.



And when you hurt me—
no.
When you broke me—
when you tore through me like wildfire,
leaving only ash and echo…



I still couldn’t hate you.



Even as I sat in the ruins of myself,
breath shallow,
hope wrung dry,
heart cracked open like a cathedral roof in a storm.
I still.
Couldn’t.
Hate you.



Because I knew.
I knew where it came from.
The ghosts that taught you how to run.
The pain that made you flinch at love.
I saw it all.
And I understood.



But understanding doesn’t stop the bleeding.



And I grieve.



Oh, I grieve...



All the tomorrows we’ll never get.
The slow mornings tangled in blankets and warmth.
The inside jokes.
The forehead kisses.
The quiet. The safe. The always.



I grieve the way your hand fit mine
like it was carved from the same ache.
The way your soul sounded like home.



I grieve what we could’ve been.



But still…
I don’t regret knowing you.
Even if it wrecked me.



Because for a moment—
for a breath in time—
I touched your soul.



And it was jagged.
And it was beautiful.
And it was you.



And I loved you.



And I still do.
And that…
That has to be the end of the story.",4,1754023106.0,Original_Poetry,1,1.0,False

1men73l,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1men73l/a_burnt_memory_part_1/,A Burnt Memory Part 1,"I woke up in a room I hadn’t seen in years, but it was familiar. The bed, the posters, the shelves, it all hit me at once. It was my bedroom from my junior year of high school. I stumbled out of bed, confused. My feet landed awkwardly, like I expected the floor to be closer. In a daze, I ran to the bathroom. And there I was, staring at the teenage version of myself in the mirror, the version I blamed for everything that went wrong.

I heard my mother’s voice echo through the hallway “Jonah! We need to leave for school in 25 minutes! Are you awake?”

It had been 6 years since I had heard my mother’s voice. Before she died of brain cancer, she told me she was proud of me, no matter what. I had never been a great son, any other mother would have called me a disappointment. I was constantly jobless and couldn’t hold a job for more than a few weeks. Despite her touching last words, I couldn’t make a movie-like turnaround. Knowing I didn’t live up to them destroyed me. Hearing her voice instantly brought me to tears. My face in the mirror became blurry and distorted as my eyes welled up and tears poured down my face.

I tried to reply to my mother’s call “Alr-” But I couldn’t choke out a reply, I tried again

“Alright,” I sounded hoarse and far away but I managed to squeak it out.

I splashed cold water over my face and hair to get my head back straight before getting dressed. The cold water woke me up and I cleared my head just enough to think about what was happening around me. Was I dreaming? No—I’d never had a dream this vivid. But I couldn’t be sure. Did I hit my head? Maybe, but I don’t remember being in any dangerous situation, all I remember was getting home from a job at my neighborhood deli and plopping into bed to take a nap, but that was it.

Day 1 
I need to have a recount of this situation, I have started writing entries in this journal, which I found at the convenience store next to the deli where I work. Or, will work at. Today is just the first day of this strange situation and I couldn’t find any clues or signs as to what happened to me and why I am here. Everything looked normal—like nothing had changed. But my life had been flipped backward, without warning. I went to school and had a quiz in my pre-calculus class and I easily flew through each question since I had already taken this class and more advanced classes years ago. A few teachers even complimented me on my attentiveness and how easily I grasped the concepts (that I already knew). I decided to keep a low profile and pass my classes with decent grades. Later on, when I get that set I could start doing better and getting into more advanced classes. I need to get into a good college this time around.

I ate dinner with my mother back at home after school and tried to have a normal dinner with her. Every word was forced out through gritted teeth and blurry vision. “So hun how was your day?” She asked me sincerely, “M- My day was good, h-how about yours?” I stammered, “Mine was fine, my friend told me his daughter was planning to transfer to your school. Maybe you could help her feel more comfortable at school?” I could tell she was trying to set me up or something, but mentally, I was already nearly 30 years old so the thought of being set up with a teenage girl disgusted me.

“Oh… uh. Yeah, I’ll see if she needs help,” I said quickly, avoiding eye contact. “Thank you!” she said enthusiastically. It was quiet. I said what I had to, and smiled when I needed to.

Day 3 
By now, I’d gotten good at pretending not to know too much. My teachers didn’t seem to focus on me much except for a few compliments from teachers about how I seemed to be doing better and being more attentive in class. My mother is doing good, she told me the name of her co-worker’s daughter and I recognized the name, I remember her being a new student during my junior year, she was pretty quiet but she had a few friends from art classes as far as I know.

Day 6 
I think something changed. From what I remember, every day had been a normal school day, I found the girl my mom suggested, and she seemed like she had already met a few people so I didn’t worry much about it. During a class, I don’t even remember what class it was, or what class was after or before, but as I was filling in blank lines on paper, I could hear my teacher’s voice but didn’t hear anything she was saying, I heard the muffled speech coming from speakers next door, I could hear pencils around me scratching on paper, then I couldn’t.

Everything around me disappeared, or I couldn’t see anything, just me and my desk. I’m not sure how to explain it but I felt extreme pressure, I looked up and I couldn’t see anything past the end of my desk, and I couldn’t move. A moment later, I blinked and everything was back around me. I might have fallen asleep and dreamt it, I can’t be sure but it didn’t feel like any dream I had ever had.

Day 10 
I remember people that existed when I was in high school that don’t exist here. I remember a student who was on the basketball team named Eric Mitchell who I can’t find anywhere. The spelling of the name of my school is wrong, it should be Maplewood High School. I know it used to be Maplewood because I had a poster in my room that screamed “MAPLEWOOD HIGH” in bold red letters from when our school won the basketball regional championship. But now the posters plastered everywhere around the halls read Mapelwood High School. A student Eric Mitchell was voted MVP of the basketball team the year they won the regional championship, but no one even knows his name. I’ve asked around and nothing. A few teachers might also be different but I can’t remember.

Day 20 
This morning I came downstairs, and the stairs creaked under my feet, louder than usual, too loud. Has it always been so loud? My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I kept reaching for the walls, I needed to hold onto something. Mom was there in the kitchen, leaning on the counter. She had her phone in one hand, coffee steam floating next to her.

“Hun, your tie is messed up,” she said, waving her hand toward my chest. Her voice was calm, warm—so motherly, like nothing had ever changed. Like she hadn’t been gone for years, it almost knocked the air out of me. I tried to adjust my tie, but my hands fumbled and my fingers numb.

“Here let me help you” she quickly says as she grabs the knot on my tie and tightens it to my collar. “Better?” she asked, tilting her head with her soft smile. “Yeah, thanks,” I mumbled, but the words didn’t sound right. Too sharp, too flat, and it didn’t sound like my voice. I swallowed hard, my smile still stretched on my face.

She turned back to the counter, reaching for her coffee. I sat down at the kitchen table, trying to stop my hands from trembling. Then I heard it—soft, almost a whisper. She was humming. I froze. The melody curled through the air like steam from her cup. I hadn’t heard it in over a decade, but I knew every note. It was the lullaby she used to sing when I couldn’t sleep. When I was little and scared of thunderstorms or nightmares or just being alive.

“Sleep, my star, the sky is near, The night won’t stay, I’ll keep you here…” Her voice was quiet, not even singing really—just breathing the song like it had never left her. Or maybe it never had. I couldn’t breathe. My chest tightened, and my eyes burned again. The tears came before I could stop them.

“You still remember that?” I whispered. She glanced over her shoulder with a soft smile. “Of course,” she said. “You always quieted down when I sang it. Like magic.” She chuckled gently. “Still works, huh?”

I nodded, swallowing the lump in my throat. I wanted to tell her everything. That I’d failed. That she died. That I missed her so much it broke me. But all I could do was sit there, listening like a child again—safe, for just a moment.

I slid out the front door shortly after and drove myself to school. I don’t remember the drive, I just remember walking through the main doors and seeing the secretary wave at me but I couldn’t react. I just kept walking, head down.

I got myself through the day somehow, but the walls were screaming at me. The bright posters, all those colors, and letters kept pulling at my eyes, daring me to look closer. “Mapelwood High School.” Wrong. It was wrong. It mocked me like they knew what I remembered.

I got in my car and I started driving on pure instinct, I drove to the hospital near my house, the one my mother lay in, dying.

“H-Hi good afternoon, can I see a Ms. Carol Vance?” I asked the receptionist, tears pulling at the corners of my eyes.

She directed me to a different part of the building, to room 56. Room 56, the room I watched her take her last breath, the same room she told me she would be back home in no time. I pushed through the door, seeing her dark eyes and pale face sunken into the memory foam pillow underneath her head. The scent of antiseptic and faint lavender, her favorite lotion, drifted into the air as if seeping through the walls. I rested my hand on her shoulder to wake her without startling her. Her eyes fluttered open in slow motion as her eyes scanned the room, eventually landing on my face. I exhaled a breath I hadn’t known I was holding.

“H-Hi mom, how a-are you f-feeling?” I whispered “Jonah? Jonah is that you?” she asked me grabbing my hand, “Yes m-mom, it’s me” I assured her with a weight sinking in my heart, “Hi son” she exhaled, “M-Mom are you alright?” I stammered, placing my other hand over her hand which was grabbing onto mine firmly “Haha, yes hun I am alright, how are you?” “W-Well, I’m not exactly sure. There's a lot on my mind, I’m just not sure what” My eyes found the floor in front of my shoes, avoiding her gaze. “Well, I always say, you’ve survived one hundred percent of the things you’ve been through, so what is one more?”

I sighed through a smile, I looked up and met her gaze, she was smiling, cheeks twitching. “Yeah, you’re right” I nodded my head and my eyes found the floor once again, a long pause between us.

“Well, I better head home to help my mom with din-” I froze. My eyes widened in fear and confusion. Help my mom with dinner? But my mom is right here in front of me! I snapped my head up to look at her, panic filling my chest but my eyes saw my hands chopping vegetables on a cutting board. I wasn’t in the hospital anymore. I was back at home. But how? The knife slipped from my grasp, clattering against the cutting board. My hands froze, trembling over the counter. I lost control of my legs and fell strumbled back. I slammed against the counter, breath jolted from my lungs. I bounced off the counter and fell forward. The last thing I saw was the corner of the counter in front of me, getting closer, fast.

Day 21? 
I woke up in a bed with this notebook next to me, I don’t know whose notebook this is. The handwriting looks identical to mine near the beginning, but I don’t remember writing any of this, let alone any of it happening to me. But towards the end, the handwriting gets increasingly frantic over time and becomes scribbles and scratches at the very end. I decided to write in this assuming it’s mine. I can’t remember who I am, but based on this notebook my name is Jonah and my mother is Carol. I don’t know if I am a high school student or an adult. Is my mom dead? Is she alive?

End entries

After finishing the sentence, I dropped the pen and ran to the bathroom after my situation sunk in. Who am I? I splashed water on my face and into my eyes, brisk water filled my eyes as my hands directed themselves towards a towel somewhere to the right of me, I don’t know how I knew that was there but I used it to dry off my eyes. I cleared my eyes of water and looked at the mirror. I saw a person, but the more I looked, the less sense it made, I saw a man, but I kept staring and realized it was a boy, I blinked and it was still a man. It felt like my eyes couldn’t focus but I saw the face clearly, it just didn’t make any sense.

I brought my face closer to the mirror. I was about 6 inches away from the mirror at that point. Inches, I measure in inches. Am I American? At the same time, I saw stubble and smooth skin on “my” jaw. Is it my face?

I can’t feel my hands, they’re tingling, I’ve lost control of them, I can’t keep them still. My heart is pounding too hard, too fast, like it’s about to burst out of my chest. Every breath feels wrong like it’s too shallow, it’ll never be enough. I’m drowning. The eerie silence was filled with my ears humming, I could almost think of something, why can’t I think of anything? My thoughts were right there, but they were behind a wall, a thick, stone wall.

My hands grasped the cold stone, I felt it crumble under my hand, small pieces shattering and bouncing off my arm. I lifted my left foot onto a protruding rock below me, it shifted under my weight. Again I stretched my arm to pull myself higher, I lifted my leg to push my body to the next stone, I could see the top, and with every step I took, it got no closer. COME ON! CLIMB! My foot slipped out of the foothold I had, my hand shot out to grab onto something, anything. My fingers grasped around a jagged edge, but it came loose. I fell back. The top of the wall shrunk, and I kept falling, where’s the ground?! I fell for minutes, but the top of the wall faded into a grey, jagged horizon.

I was coughing up sand, tasting salt and grit. My hands were raw, covered in grains. I stumbled forward, the sand burning underfoot, and the horizon flickered. I scrambled to get up off the sand and onto my feet, where am I now? If I am facing water, there must be more land behind me! I turned to escape this arid beach, behind me was… another beach? I took a step forward, but as I picked up my foot, my other sank into the sand, as if the sand was a liquid. God, why? I fell forward with my foot stuck beneath the sand's surface and landed on my hands, they also passed straight through the top of the sand. I heard the hissing of sand around me, I picked up my head just in time to see walls of sand rising, swallowing me whole. I glimpsed the sun dipping out of view behind the sand consuming me. Sand compacted around my body scarring my skin, it filled my throat and tore my eyes, each grain scraping until there was nothing but darkness left. I choked on the coarse grains. They wooshed as they pushed into my ears, ripping my eardrums, replacing wooshing with a deafening, endless ringing.

Left with none of my five senses, I plunged into pure darkness. The feeling of sand scuffing my skin faded, and the ringing in my ears echoed around me. It felt like drifting through space—not the space you see in photos attached to articles taken with telescopes orbiting Earth, but the chilling, cold, and empty void space really is. The vast emptiness stretched endlessly, a silent, crushing void where no warmth or light could reach. An icy numbness seeped into every part of me, it stripped away any trace of life and warmth I’d ever known.

“Mom…” My words shaped themselves, whispering past my lips.

But who is she? My heart throbbed inside my chest, arms and legs twitching with each pulse. I strained to understand my body's connection to this word, a frayed thread hanging in the void of my head. It feels like my brain was stitched into another person’s body, a sloppy patchwork sticking me with feelings that aren’t my own.

The space around me shifted, In front of me, a black, shiny surface gleamed. I reached out, but my hand couldn’t make contact. I saw a reflection fade into view. A reflection? I saw a man, Me?",2,1754022941.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

**What to Expect During Your Whitening Journey**

When you book a teeth whitening treatment with Dr. Phil DDS, here's how your experience unfolds:

* **Initial Consultation**: An assessment of dental health, stain type, and suitability for whitening
* **Planning Session**: Creation of custom trays and review of at-home protocol
* **First Whitening Session**: In-clinic application to lift major discolorations
* **Second Office Visit**: Follow‑up whitening to perfect results
* **At‑Home Treatment**: Gentle nightly bleaching to fine‑tune brightness
* **Advice & Follow‑Up**: Tips on how to protect your results and schedule any touch-ups

**Why Dr. Phil DDS Stands Out in Plainview**

Plainview's residents have trusted [**Dr. Phil DDS**](https://www.drphildds.com/discover-your-best-smile-with-dr-phil-ddss-teeth-whitening-procedure-in-plainview/) not only for whitening but for a full suite of cosmetic and restorative dental services—from veneers and implants to one-visit crowns. Welcoming patients across Nassau County, Dr. Phil's practice uses modern tech like digital x‑rays, CAD-CAM scanning, and laser tools for safe and efficient care.

**Aftercare Advice to Keep Your Smile Shining**

The work isn't done when the whitening treatment ends. Dr. Phil's team recommends:

* Avoiding staining foods and drinks (coffee, berries, red wine) for the first few days
* Using touch‑up trays periodically—typically every few months
* Practicing fluoride treatments or whitening polishing during routine cleanings to fight future staining

**Real Results That Make an Impression**

Although Dr. Phil hasn't publicly published exact statistical outcomes, many patients leave reviews praising noticeably brighter teeth and enhanced overall appearance—whether for special events or long-term confidence boosts.

**Is Professional Whitening Right for You?**

If you're ready to go beyond store-bought kits and invest in visibly brighter results—safely and predictably—Dr. Phil DDS's teeth whitening is a smart choice. Their clinical-grade treatment, personalized care, and modern facilities help Plainview residents get the smile they've always wanted.

**What Our Patients Are Saying**

*""I tried every whitening strip and toothpaste out there—nothing worked like Dr. Phil's professional treatment. I noticed a huge difference after just one session!""*  
— *Megan L., Plainview*

*""The custom trays and support were amazing. My smile looks better than it did on my wedding day. I'll be recommending Dr. Phil to all my friends!""*  
— *Jason T., Bethpage*

*""Not only was the whitening fast, but the team made me feel comfortable from the start. No sensitivity at all, and I love the results!""*  
— *Carla R., Hicksville*

**FAQs**

1. **Is teeth whitening safe for everyone?** While teeth whitening is safe for most individuals, it's essential to consult with Dr. Phil DDS to determine if it's suitable for you, especially if you have existing dental conditions.
2. **How long do the results last?** With proper care, teeth whitening results can last up to two years. Avoiding staining foods and maintaining good oral hygiene can prolong the effects.
3. **Will teeth whitening make my teeth sensitive?** Some patients may experience temporary sensitivity after whitening treatments, but this typically subsides within a few days.
4. **Can over-the-counter products achieve the same results?** Over-the-counter products may offer minimal improvements. Professional treatments at Dr. Phil DDS provide more significant and longer-lasting results.
5. **How often can I whiten my teeth?** It's advisable to wait at least six months between professional whitening sessions. Dr. Phil DDS can provide personalized recommendations based on your needs. 

**Next Step: Book Your Consultation**

Consider a consultation to assess whether whitening treatment suits your dental health and aesthetic goals. With treatment starting quickly—from custom trays to in-office sessions—you could be smiling brighter within weeks.

She looked confused in the starting when I was walking more than the usual. 

The usual was the bare minimum my hungover dehydrated self could do. 

I make my self a Moka pot coffee and read 15-20 pages of a book. Reading which got somewhere lost in the past. 

Do not have to force myself to exercise. Even the less active days are more active then when I was hungover. 

No more blabbering conversations in the night with people repeating topics and forgetting them. 

Life is good being sober. Relearning how to enjoy and appreciate life. 

I have slipped twice in the last 50-60 days. But that slip was only 01 day. I need to get myself to be completely sober, no more traps of moderation or allowances. Being sober is the number one priority.

Thats also not an abnormal thing I have two main teachers that just prefer their first name. So Mr.J teacher my absolute favorite class and a subject I want a career in, so I got very attached to him as a teacher because of that too. However I also just, on the first day of class was already drawn to him for whatever reason, I think he's a very interesting person. So I kept working with him for class and whatnot then the second year I had him, my mother died, and he saw and helped me through pretty well every breakdown I had, and I always felt bad for dragging him into my problems, but he was very nice about it always. Then he had to tell his classes, that he'd been diagnosed with cancer, which another teacher told him it'd be best to tell me one on one because my mother. Which was again really kind, so he kind of became my emotional support person, the first person Id go to when I felt like I was going to cry. Im still kind of guilty about doing that. But anyway we do theater and I was a designer and since he was our instructor for that and he would be there often he gave me and my friend/co-designer his number so we could ask questions if he wasn't there, but I somehow ended up pitching the idea of sending him animal photos while he got infusions so for every other week for months I would just spend an hour sending him pet photos and he'd occasionally ask me things and I really just feel like we've become friends, but I know, I know it's strange, but never ever once has he made me uncomfortable for give me any sort of weird feeling. I trust him more then anyone and I genuinely see him more then I see my actual father (who I dont have a terrible relationship with, but hes just difficult, cause alcohol) though actually one time I almost asked Mr.J for a ride home because my father was too drunk to drive me, it didnt end up happening cause my freinds dad was able to, but he was a genuine option to me because I trust him enough, and also he knows about my dads alcholism whereas my friends didnt as much. Which I did have a middle school teacher offer me a ride once so it wasnt that strange to me. On another note he also already would take classes out to get ice cream sometimes cause we have a very small class and so do some of my other teachers, and I had a different teacher buy me dinner once, so its not that strange to get food from my teachers and since I was a teacher assistant in the morning we'd frequently go get coffee since it was in walking distance and I just yap to him all the time. He also invited me and a friend (almost all of what I say goes for one of my friends too because we're always together) to work a professional theater show and Im just really stressed. Idk idk why Im writing this I dont expect a single person to read all of this, idk even know if it makes any sense. Im just curious if I might make my teacher uncomfortable, cause I often feel very pushy and like I'm prying and Im worried I'll get him in trouble.",6,1754022633.0,Teachers,19,0.81,False
1men398,https://i.redd.it/dckfwkco5cgf1.jpeg,New purchases,"Quick reviews for a couple of recent purchases ( mainly in the interest of alternative content to clones 😉) 

Eight & Bob - Nuit de Mègeve

This is Vetiver forward ( Vetiver is probably my favourite note ) but also has a bit of interest with some Coffee and Tonka. Not overly keen on most Coffee frags I’ve tried but this one is firmly in the background so it’s not too sharp or cloying. The Tonka gives a tiny bit of sweetness but it’s the Vetiver that comes through most of all. 
Happy with this purchase, went for the 30ml as it’s more than enough. 
I wish more brands did 15 or 30ml bottles as I rarely get through 100ml of anything.


Santa Maria Novella - Tabacco Toscano 

A lovely light Tobacco, easy to wear and a true unisex. Vanilla and Musk give it a bit of sweetness/ creaminess, almost goes lactonic to me but thankfully doesn’t get there  as I can’t abide milky notes. 
The Tobacco isn’t too strong so this is easy to wear anytime of the year. This would be a great one for anyone looking to get into Tobacco scents .

I’m a 32-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **ATP Toronto Showdown: Fabian Marozsan vs. Flavio Cobolli – A Tale of Two Form Curves**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your rackets and your popcorn, because we’re about to witness a tennis match that’s less *Wimbledon* and more *The IT Crowd*. On one side, we have **Flavio Cobolli**, the Italian “I-Talian” (get it? *flavio*… *flavor*? Never mind, I’ll sit here in silence), who’s won four of his last five matches but looked like a man trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded in his opener against Galarneau. On the other, **Fabian Marozsan**, the Hungarian “Maro-zen Master,” who’s won three of his last five but has the kind of focus that makes a laser pointer look lazy.

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

Let’s start with the cold, hard stats. Cobolli’s 80% win rate (4-1) sounds impressive until you realize three of those wins came against players named “Nobody Special” and “Also Nobody.” His lone loss? A three-set thriller against Galarneau that probably gave the crowd a case of tennis elbow from all the nail-biting. Meanwhile, Marozsan’s 60% win rate (3-2) includes two matches where he played like a man possessed—think of him as the tennis version of a Roomba on a coffee high: relentless, efficient, and not to be trifled with.
