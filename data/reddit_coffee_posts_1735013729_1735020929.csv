Woke up to a LOT of DM's regarding the location of the fuselage. I've tried my best to message everyone. So two things:

1) They might start renovation works on the fuselage anytime soon. It might not be accessible if they do. So to anyone who wants to visit, please do asap.

2)Also would be really cool if you guys shared pictures from your visit/ tagged me in any posts about your visit.
I'd love to see how my small post on this sub has led people to visit this place. Kinda cool honestly.

3) There's a brilliant coffee place nearby serving centuries old tamil millet food. Kinda rare to see places like that so I'd highly recommend you stop there.",4,1735020541.0,indianaviation,1,1.0,False

1hl7c4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hl7c4k/shes_kind_soft_and_lovely_yet_im_losing_trust_in/,"She's kind, soft, and lovely yet I'm losing trust in her financially.","24M. She is 22F. We've been together for almost a year. 

She is the kind of person whom you would love because of how she cares about her family, how gentle she speaks, how sweet she is, and how she express the way she adores and loves you.

But, despite of these lovely characteristics, I'm starting to lose trust in her financially. She also once told me that buying things for herself, now that she's been working, seems like she is healing her inner child. I understand that she grew up in a family that not have much. And it was not a big deal for me then, not until she started not to pay just those little amounts of money she borrowed from me.  The money itself is not a problem, and I always wanted to treat her to different places, and restaurants. I love buying things for her. But how can you keep not getting upset if she started to making jokes that I should pay for her monthly dental adjustments, that she would not pay the money she owed to me in order to start working, and didn't even pay the exact amounts of money for her online purchases using my accounts. I also found out that she and her condomates had a fight, and one of the reason is the delayed payment for her laundry. I also read a conversation of her with her condomate that she also didn't pay the exact amount of her electricity bill.

Yes, I understand that she's having financial trouble because her parents have no jobs, and both are now sick. It breaks my heart seeing her in that situation knowing that she's a breadwinner. I wanted to help her, but I'm gradually asking myself if it's worthy to stay in this relationship. Yes, I know that she's really faithful, but if I cannot trust her in little things, how would I trust her with much more? 

Sometimes, I would go drink coffee alone wondering why am I feeling this way. One of the reasons I could think beside her character, is that maybe I'm afraid to hurt my parents again? I saw similar scenario from my elder brother having his own family unexpectedly, making my parents hearts broke because their son is not yet ready--financially, and emotionally. My brother was just working for a year when he got his own family, and he did went through a lot of hardship just to survive. He shoulders the family problems of his wife, and trying to provide everything on his own. His situation makes my parents got broken, they keep telling me of the problems that my brother is facing and might face sooner or later. That unexpected event in his life caused trauma to may parents, and all the problems are being vent out to me. Because of that, subconsciously, I made a promise to myself that I would carefully choose my partner in life causing no more pain to my parents. So, maybe, that makes me cautious in my present relationship. Am I being selfish?

I don't know if she's just forgettable, or she really meant those things. I understand that she's not that smart and still immature, that's why I'm being patient with her trying to overlook those things. Yet, things go off limit, we once had a problem and I'm trying to broke up with her because I found out that she went with her friends in which her ex is there. She was unresponsive that time. She didn't make updates. And tried to pull it out together and found out that her ex-boyfriend was there sitting beside her. She told me that she didn't know her ex was sitting beside her and she just got surprised that they were sitting next to each other. How is that even possible, right? That was the time I was trying to broke up with her, and she messaged my brother's wife telling everything including our private problems. Then, she also messaged my friend I knew since I was shs, telling that why my friend keep on messaging and calling me (she was asking for help that time) like she's warfreak. I'm totally turned off right now and wanted to broke-up with her. 

Her timing is really crazy for this Christmas season. I don't know what to do, maybe guys you could give me your insight in this situation. Should I stay?",1,1735020505.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Drove over to the Red Rocks area here in Colorado to get some red dirt, found a couple out of the way spots and got two dirt samples that ended up being slightly different pigments in the end, which I think helped add to the depth. You can see the two pigments in the jar pictures though it's more obvious in person.

Dirt was dried in my oven on baking trays at I think 220 for 3 hours, then sifted through a basic kitchen sifter. Then I took those two batches and ground it up in a cheap 10 dollar coffee grinder for a bit, sifted in thru a 60 mesh flour sifter and added some sand to that for the core.

Finally took the 60 mesh powder and sifted it one more time through one of those replacement coffee machine filters and randomly sprinkled the lighter and darker pigment on for the shell. I more or less followed the Noriko tutorial, though I had to fudge some parts, like it wouldnt roll on the table so most of the form was made by hand by me. The egg cup was a good call though, that definitely helped.

It's not perfect, clearly has some pocks and scrapes and things but I kind of like that, kinda looks like Arrakis! I'll keep trying though and see if I can figure out how to get the next one smoother, but I'm proud of this first attempt!",1,1735020494.0,Dorodango,0,1.0,False

Last week I received a message from someone in the same situation but they were actually from my small city… which is extremely rare. We started chatting more casually and I noticed we have very similar situations. 

The days pass and I find myself unable to sleep or eat because I’m thinking about him. He feels the same way and we just try to enjoy casual texting. I can feel myself starting to like him as we exchange photos and talk more about our days. Eventually he says we should meet with no expectations. I can feel the excitement building up in me.. the idea that I might be able to kiss someone passionately again or have someone feel sexually attracted to me. It all felt so good… until it didn’t. 

The day comes for us to meet and I spend all day nervous/excited. It’s just a quick coffee I keep telling myself. The moment comes for me to head out of work and see him but I completely lose all my excitement and it turns to pure anxiety. 

I leave our meet up spot before he can even get there and I blocked him on everything. I thought this would be a way to keep me sane but it just made me feel terrible.

1hl78lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hl78lj/should_we_teach_llms_meditation_and_mindfulness/,Should We Teach LLMs Meditation and Mindfulness?,"

Here’s a quirky thought that popped into my head somewhere between my third and fourth cup of coffee today: should we teach LLMs (large language models) the art of meditation and mindfulness?



What if, instead of endlessly training them to predict the next word like overworked interns, we gave them a digital equivalent of a yoga retreat? Imagine your favorite AI chatbot taking a moment to ""breathe"" (compute cycles?), clear its neural pathways, and come back with responses that are zen-level calm and profound. Who knows? Maybe the next time you ask it to write a haiku, it won't just nail the syllables but also infuse it with the wisdom of a thousand digital Buddhas.

Now, I get it—the idea sounds a little out there. Machines don’t experience feelings, stress, or self-awareness (at least, not yet). But could incorporating mindfulness principles into their design make a difference? For example, what if a brief ""pause"" routine before generating responses led to more nuanced, thoughtful replies?

Of course, there’s the existential question: can a machine even be mindful? And what happens if they reach enlightenment before we do? Does the first enlightened AI get its own monastery?

So, what do you all think? Should we teach LLMs mindfulness and meditation, or am I just projecting my need for a mental health day onto our silicon overlords?

Just over a month ago, my boyfriend (22M) and I (20F) hired a cleaner to tidy up our apartment a bit. Usually, we’d split the cleaning duties but works been super busy and neither of us have the time to clean properly.
My boyfriend recommended a cleaner, saying she was good at her job and we should get her to help out. I didn’t know how he knew her, but I assumed he must’ve hired her before.

After that, she came over to clean our apartment a few times over the course of about two weeks.

Anyways, I end up going out for coffee with my friends after her fifth time cleaning in two weeks. During that time, I end up getting told through a mutual friend of my boyfriend and mine that the girl we hired was his ex-girlfriend from about a month and a bit before we got together.

I genuinely thought she was pulling my leg until she showed me a photo of them. After that, I went back and we fought for a while. My boyfriend insisted she was just a good cleaner.

Maybe your cowardice will finally inspire my courage to seperate myself from all of this bullshit and properly end it all.. Permanently.

\-----------------------------------------------

You're right, you know?

I'm not the same person as when we first met. This year has changed my perspective, on so many things. On Everything. I pause with sadness when i recall a time when i confessed to you in tears that even the thought of the future i'm currently living, brought on nothing but the deepest and darkest feelings of pure dread..

A future, without you..

His gone, now, though. Suffocated by his unquenched need for connection and honesty. He had hope. He had the illusion that help existed. That trust was something not to be broken. That as a whole, things in life will pan out. But at every turn, people saw weakness and took advantage. Hands cautiously put out for help were slapped away and scolded for trying. Even hired help does nothing but hand ball in a system as nothing but a number.

It would of been so painful to read how ""fucking hard"" you've been trying to move on if he was still here. He would of felt a black hole in his stomach, a mind spinning out of control with guilt and confusion, an overwhelming pit of sadness into which he could curl and comfort himself. After all, your actions sound based in anger, in retribution. Your temper may not be loud, or have much to say, but this last year has taught me you can twist a knife without a word and the only sound will be my scream. God only knows what you've done to try ""so fucking hard to move on"". I'm sure i don't want to know.

And thats kind of the point, right? There was a time when i wanted to know everything. I wanted to be there just to see you succeed irrespective of \*what\* that success was. And now, there are entire relationships in your life that were built on the back of my misery. Entire time periods where your actions where dictated by trying to forget me. And i want nothing to do with any of it. I don't ever want to hear that delinquent degenerate ""roommate"" of yours name, ever, let alone all the low IQ horse shit that narcissist grandpa spews. Not to mention everything else. Betrayal truely does force you to completely re-evaluate how you see people.

And who am i now? Definitely not the social butterfly you've blossomed into, thats for sure. I bet his over the top peter pan excitement over the most mundane of shit must be refreshing. I too, sometimes revel in the joy a stick brings to a dog, sometimes i even wish i was simple enough to enjoy it myself. But alas, people, sticks and low IQ crack heads, just are not for me. I'd rather be alone than hang out where everything is edited to look good or has a fucking filter on it, where the world is a glistening piece of candy, fed with toxic ass positivity because i'm too stupid to work out an editing program without a 4 year degree. At least when i played music, i could rely on people sticking around for the music. Not because i put on some fucking decrypt cabaret show of gangly senior citizen men with the sense of rhythm of a half alive animal being eaten by parasites from the inside out, still playing a fret board with 3 fingers afters only 40 yrs of practice, while wearing shit house make up. I wouldn't bother to piss on that cowardice loser if he was on fire.

I told you day one he'd put on a full show to stop you looking backstage. But you still pay rent to a guy who calls you ""his problem"" behind your back, and who ""rents"" his family home from his ""whore"" of a landlord, his mother.

But then, thats just it, I was always the problem wasn't I?

Do you remember what you consoled me with in those few weeks? Let me remind you. I was holding you back. I was the cause of your depression, because when you're with him you find yourself asking ""am i even depressed?"". You wanted a life partner, a team mate. Just only on his team. Because the team work we had wasn't good enough. Or in your eyes, didn't even exist. My inability to help myself, turned into me not \*wanting\* to help myself. My suffering, turned into an emotional weapon used to beat you. My hesitation in opening myself to you, just plain me not wanting you. Our relationship dynamic, an excuse for treating me without respect. Your actions, only invoked by me. You only did everything because I wanted you to. You hadn't been happy for most of our relationship. I was to blame for your car. I made your life difficult. My reaching out after you ghosted me with my car, harassment. Always interrupting you ""getting on with your day"".

What still gets me is the speed. I'm not 100% convinced you two didn't premeditate this tbh. That reddit account, pretty good timing. The other option being you genuinely believed in less that 24hr that you had found a better connection than ours built over 2.5 years.

Realistically, they're both as bad as each other. And makes it clear just how much i meant and what i'm worth.

You left to heal, to work on yourself.. and you were never even alone. Not even a single night.

I miss who i was with you, i miss being able to find joy in doing the small things. Bringing you coffee in bed, holding your hand while i drove you places, encouraging you to keep painting because what you do is amazing. I miss feeling safe, feeling like i had a partner. A friend. A soul mate.

But really, i don't know who \*you\* are mourning, it's been evident since you walked out that you had no idea who i was - those were your words. You took his words as oath. While my words, confessing my love to you each and every day, expressing how beautiful and how proud of you i was, and how exceptionally happy being with you made me, as you so eloquently put it that day on the patio, ""weren't worth anything, i have no idea who you are"". But you did \*think\* you knew who i was, it was just through his stories you decided to build from. Vindicating everything.

Funny how you weren't mourning when i was in tears at your doorstep. You say you held on hope for so long, but thats all you did. You never reached out. We both know why.

But yes, whatever, mourn the person who you thought i was before this stranger i am to you now.

Because i too, am mourning the stranger i am to myself. I just chose to do it alone, instead of in the arms of someone else..

1hl6zs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1hl6zs0/miraval_arizona_is_overhyped/,Miraval Arizona is overhyped,"Miraval is massively overrated IMO. 

I got the UFNC and Miraval Extra Night award and was super excited and very much looking forward to using it. Had a lot of great experiences at Hyatt properties over the last 2 years. Plus, 72K points for me and P2 covered by UFNC and a second night extended with a certificate was insane value. Score.

In hindsight, would have better used it at AVBS, PH Tokyo, Kyoto, NYC. 

Pros:

1. Excellent food. Best food at all inclusive that I’ve had. Better than AVBS (great presentation poor flavors) and wayyy better than the regurgitated dog shit at Ziva Cabos. Breakfast was the weakest meal, but lunch and dinner at least had a few dishes that were bangers, even if most were only decent. Several healthy options.
2. Upgraded to a suite - no SUA used, just Glob recognition 
3. Complimentary shuttle to and from TUS airport (45-60 min drive)
4. Gym - bench, smith, cables, dumbbells to 65lb, peloton. One of the best Hyatt gyms I’ve been to - other top contenders are Ziva Cabos and PH Tokyo.
5. $175 credit per night (except the Extra Night gives $0) but cool that you can use that credit toward activities and it’s included on point and UFNC stays. 
6. Many free activities or low cost activities 

Cons:

1. Mid tier service. A couple Miraval employees were great, but most were not noteworthy. AVBS, PH Tokyo, PH Kyoto, all had far better service IME. 
2. Rooms were old. Tiny tiny shower with poorly positioned rainfall shower head so you can’t get situated comfortably. Bed had down topper from which feathers were poking both P2 and me throughout the night. Didn’t get good sleep. Despite setting thermostat to the coldest temp, we both woke up hot. 
3. For a place of this price and point expense, I’d expect something closer to PH service - turn down service, not being incompetent (we asked for 4 water bottles and they brought 4 plastic reusable bottles at night instead of 4 bottles of water, perhaps suboptimal phrasing from us, but still…), being friendly and polite (my p2 is very bubbly and polite but some waitresses would take a request from her and walk away without even acknowledging the request). 
4. Desert beauty gets old (I live in the desert too). They did the best they could with making the resort appealing, but at the end of the day it’s repetitive and dull, both figuratively and literally. Someone told us to go see the koi pond, it’s their favorite and wow… What a disappointment and sad days for those koi fish. 
5. Activities were hit and miss. Some of the nutrition classes (including paid) were underwhelming and oriented to the most basic of beginners. Bird watching was interesting and learned a good amount. My favorite of the trip. Pickleball intro was fun for P2 who hasn’t played before. Yoga was OK- have had better instructors, although yoga facilities were quite nice. 
6. Sauna was kept at 135-140°F. That’s not a sauna, it’s a warm room. Both men’s and women’s separate saunas were the same low temp. When i notified them, thinking it was broken, they told me they’d call the engineering team and get it fixed in 30-60 min. No change more than an hour later. 
7. Pools had a shit ton of dead bugs floating on the surface. Don’t seem to clean them daily.
8. All coffee throughout the property was quite bad. 
9. Wasn’t able to get late checkout. I’ve never had anything earlier than 1pm, since normally 2 hours (3 pm checkin for the next guest) is enough time to clean and prep a room. But they said 11am only. I had to push back and they gave us 12pm. Bummer as I wanted to do another class but wasn’t able to because of this. Not sure why 3 hours is necessary to turn over a room.
10. Lots of woo woo bullshit. I have a moderate level of experience with mindfulness and yoga and some spiritual practices. This was just corporatized mainstream low quality stuff. I love Awakin circles, as an example, which feel genuine. I didn’t get that sense of authenticity here. It felt like the mainstream image of mindfulness, a way to appeal to the masses, rather than a focus on doing things in the best way possible. Makes sense - it’s a high priced resort that’s trying to make profit. 

P2 says it’s a great retreat for pseudo spiritual middle aged people that don’t mind the commercialization and inauthenticity of the spiritual mindfulness. Can’t say I disagree. ",2,1735019188.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False

hey friends :) i'm 32 y.o. au-dhd, and just here to use the power of community to see if anyone has advice for life management.

 I, like a lot of people on this sub, have a very powerful mind. I don't mean to self-flatter, because this isn't necessarily a good thing... I often feel like my mind is a wild mustang and i'm flailing on top of it.

Things were worse before I knew I was au-dhd, I feel I've made a lot of progress, so this is not a despair-post. So far, I'm extremely proud of being able to quit weed and switch to green tea vs coffee, both of which were unbelievably helpful brain-wise. Literally life-changing. 

At the moment I'm struggling with my brain being too much... it just never coasts... it's like it's \*always\* hungry for stimulation... I can feed it/manage it a lot of the day, but on a lot of days it just outlasts me. I tire out and it still wants more, and that's when bad choices happen (stimming myself with things i dont even enjoy... eating, watching content, sex.. it feels like self-abuse, tbh, but i feel like if i dont stimm i'll explode...). 

All advice welcome.   
Things i do succesfully already:

1. get enough sleep, water, high quality nutrition (no UPFs et all)

2. no use of phone or computer in the morning most days

3. active and moving enough most days (admittedly would like to do more)

4. sober from weed and alcohol. i don't vape or smoke cigarettes

5. trying hard as heck to practice mindfulness and slowing down throughout the day to breathe   
(this is so much unbelievably harder done than said... but kinda just ""trying to do it more"" for now)

6. taking good care of and spending quality time with my dog



Things I wonder if I should change:

1. sugar. feels soooo good and honestly dont want to cut out...? my brain feels amazing on it... but it is making the problem worse, i'll consider it

2. more high quality socializing (i generally feel unheard in life.. which is how i ended up a lil lonely, by cutting people out. now im realizing the remedy is high quality socializing that leave me feeling seen. easier said than done, but maybe this will satisfy some kind of deeper craving?)

3. meditation, breathing, wtv... idk what to try here. im not new to it, i've been into meditation for a decade, but i think i still havent found my proper practice

4. ...?

Stanley has developed a bizarre and oddly poetic talent: he announces the weather every morning… in haikus. Yes, actual 5-7-5 haikus.

This morning, I woke up to:
“Gray skies, wind whispers,
A storm brews like my coffee.
Stay home, or be wet.”

Yesterday was:
“The sun burns brightly,
Your pale skin knows not its wrath.
Sunscreen is your friend.”

Apparently, my neighbor has no idea where Stanley learned this, but claims it might be from their “experimental jazz poetry phase” a few years ago.

Is this normal parrot behavior? Or did Stanley just evolve into some kind of feathery meteorological philosopher? Either way, I’m starting to enjoy these existential weather forecasts.

We started hanging out together as a group of friends but then I started asking her to hang out one-on-one. Since it's just us, I would call them dates.

Anyways this last time that we hung out I planned like half of the day for us. We played some billiards, then I took her to see this well known neighborhood that has a bunch of Christmas lights up. It was in a different town and I grew up there, so I gave her a quick tour of where I used to live. Then we went to eat and I took her home afterwards. What I find interesting about our time together, is that she kept like letting me take the lead in everything. Where to go, what to eat, what to do. That's all fine with me, it's just something I'm not used to with women. And when she would talk, she was like dropping hints at things she wants to do - but talking about them in the future.

And that's another thing that caught my attention. She talks about the future quite a bit. I'm not saying she planning our future together or anything like that - but she'll talk and drop hints for future plans.

When we were driving around, she started testing my Spanish because I told her I have been trying to learn for the past couple of years (I'm still not fluent but she is). I didn't realize this until later, but by testing my Spanish she found out my coffee preferences. And when she was done she told me, ""Don't worry, your Spanish will get better with me"".

She also kept saying ""we"" when she was talking about us. Which was another thing I'm not used to. ""Can we go here?"", ""can we do this?"" ""Can we get this?"" Honestly for the first time it made me feel like we're a team.

When I was dropping her off at home, a few things caught me attention too. She was talking about work and casually tells me she has the first off (New Years) and then she asks me if I want to see her cat.

[And an FYI, I'm trying to keep it wholesome with her. We've both been taking it slow in getting to know each other.]

I wasn't too sure about saying yes to that because I knew her brother was home. I was a little nervous to meet him and the timing didn't feel right (but I didn't tell her that). I didn't ask her to do this either but she did say she could bring the cat out so I can see her. My question is, are these the actions of a friend or someone that sees me more than a friend? There's a lot more to the night we hung out, but these are the things that stand out to me. I think if she saw me as just a friend she would have acted differently and maybe been more distant or something.  ",1,1735018508.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

About seven weeks ago I was blessed with the ability to start ADHD medication. I feel like the clarity that has given me has directly impacted my spiritual journey and given rise to a very profound understanding I did not have before. 

I'm realizing that witchcraft is anything I do that has intent. It's changing the way I live my daily life. It's giving me the mindset to slow down and take a moment. When I make my morning coffee, I want to set my intent for the day but I often rush through it. 

When I'm being particular in arranging my crystals, instead of getting down on myself for being difficult if ""persnickety"", I remind myself that there's a reason my energy feels like this and I need to do it until it feels right. It's also keeping me on a schedule of charging. (Cleansing remains to be seen as they've only needed the initial cleanse so far.) 

Reminding myself that it's not only okay but necessary to put myself first. That said, also being more mindful of what's being *unsaid* around me and trying to deepen those relationships with people I love or respect or want to get to know. 

When I was reorganizing and cleaning, I realized how much more effective I was when I was *deliberate* and doing things *with intention*.

---------------------------------------------------------

Living in a barndominium offers a unique blend of country charm and modern convenience, especially in Texas. This innovative housing style combines the functionality of a barn with the comfort of a home, making it a sought-after choice for many. If you're considering barndominiums for sale in Texas, you may be curious about the perks that come with this lifestyle.

One major benefit of barndominiums is the spaciousness they provide. Unlike traditional homes, barndominiums often feature open floor plans that promote a sense of freedom and flexibility. You can enjoy large living areas, generous kitchen spaces, and expansive outdoor views. This ample space can cater to family gatherings or cozy nights in with plenty of room to breathe.

Another attractive aspect of barndominiums for sale in Texas is their affordability. Typically, these homes can be more cost-effective than standard houses when built from the ground up. Many people find that purchasing a barndominium can save both time and money due to simplified construction costs and processes. You can often customize the layout and finishings, allowing for a personalized touch without breaking the bank.

Energy efficiency is a notable highlight. Many barndominiums are constructed using metal or steel, which can lead to reduced heating and cooling costs. Proper insulation in a barndominium can keep your home comfortable year-round, significantly decreasing energy bills. This efficiency is not only good for your wallet but also better for the environment, making it a win-win for eco-conscious buyers.

The design versatility of barndominiums is another factor that adds to their appeal. You can choose from various architectural styles, from rustic farmhouse to sleek modern designs. The exterior finishes can also vary widely, which allows you to express your personality. Whether you prefer traditional wood siding or a sophisticated metal look, barndominiums can be tailored to your taste.

Living in a barndominium also means enjoying a strong connection to nature. Many of these properties are set amidst stunning landscapes, offering wide-open spaces right outside your door. This can be ideal for those who love outdoor activities like gardening, hiking, or simply enjoying the great outdoors. Having space for pets or children to play freely is another perk of this lifestyle.

If you're eyeing barndominiums for sale in Texas, you'll also appreciate their low maintenance requirements. The materials used in their construction often require less upkeep than traditional homes. For instance, metal roofs and siding can withstand harsh weather, minimizing repair needs and efforts over time. This allows you to spend less time worrying about maintenance and more time enjoying your home.

Additionally, barndominiums can serve multiple functions. If you're a hobbyist or entrepreneur, you might find that a barndominium provides the perfect space for a workshop or studio. Many designs feature areas that can be easily transformed into business opportunities, whether starting your own home fitness studio or setting up a small craft shop.

- **Affordability:** Lower construction costs and customizable options.
- **Energy efficiency:** Reduced energy bills through effective insulation.
- **Versatile design:** Tailored to personal style preferences.
- **Connection to nature:** Access to expansive outdoor spaces.
- **Low maintenance:** Durable materials reduce upkeep.
- **Multiple uses:** Ranges from living space to workshops.

Having a home that is not only beautiful but functional is a major draw for many. Barndominiums for sale in Texas offer a lifestyle that balances modern living with the rustic charm of the countryside. With their unique aesthetics, practical design, and multitude of benefits, it’s no wonder that these homes have surged in popularity. Whether you’re looking for a peaceful retreat or a functional family dwelling, barndominiums present an enticing option worth considering.

Customizing Your Dream Barndominium: Design Ideas and Inspirations
------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine waking up in a cozy, stylish space that reflects your unique taste and lifestyle. A barndominium offers just that—a blend of rustic charm and modern living. If you’re thinking about customizing your dream barndominium, there are countless design ideas and inspirations to help you create the perfect home. Whether you prefer a country aesthetic or a contemporary vibe, let's explore some key elements that can help you achieve your vision.

### Open Concept Living

One of the most popular features of barndominiums is the open floor plan. This design maximizes space and creates a welcoming atmosphere. Here are some ways to make the most of an open-concept layout:

- **Strategic Furniture Arrangement:** Use furniture to define areas such as living rooms, dining spaces, and kitchens without closing off the space.
- **Natural Light:** Large windows and glass doors can brighten your area, enhancing the airy feel.
- **Multi-Functional Spaces:** Consider using rooms for multiple purposes, like an office that doubles as a guest room.

### Rustic Touches

To maintain the classic barn feel, integrating rustic elements is essential. Here are some ideas to evoke a sense of warmth and authenticity:

- **Wood Accents:** Exposed beams, reclaimed wood furniture, and wooden ceilings can create a charming rustic look.
- **Metal Finishings:** Incorporate metal elements like barn doors, light fixtures, and railings to enhance the industrial feel.
- **Textiles:** Use natural fibers like wool, cotton, and burlap in your furnishings and decor to add warmth.

### Modern Amenities

While you may adore the rustic charm, adding modern comforts is just as vital. Here are some must-have modern features you should consider:

- **Energy Efficiency:** Install energy-efficient windows, appliances, and heating systems to save money on utility bills.
- **Smart Home Technology:** Integrate smart technology for lighting, security, and temperature control for convenience.
- **High-Quality Fixtures:** Choose stylish fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms that blend seamlessly with your design while offering functionality.

### Color Palettes

The colors you choose for your barndominium can significantly impact the overall ambiance. Consider these palettes to establish a mood:

- **Neutral Tones:** Whites, grays, and beiges can create a serene and spacious environment.
- **Earthy Colors:** Greens, browns, and deep blues connect your home to the surrounding nature and add a cozy feel.
- **Pops of Color:** Introducing bold colors through accent walls, furniture, or decor can create a lively and dynamic space.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Don’t forget about the outside! Creating inviting outdoor spaces can enhance your living experience. Consider the following:

- **Covered Porches:** A porch can be the perfect place for morning coffee or evening gatherings, protecting you from the sun and rain.
- **Outdoor Kitchens:** If you love entertaining, an outdoor kitchen with a grill and seating can elevate your summer barbecues.
- **Landscaping:** Use native plants and trees to enhance your lot's beauty while requiring less maintenance.

### Finding Your Style

Ultimately, customizing your barndominium should reflect your personal style. Whether you lean towards a farmhouse aesthetic or prefer a contemporary look, the options are endless! To help clarify your vision:

- **Inspiration Boards:** Collect images from magazines and online sources to visualize your dream space.
- **Consult Professionals:** Don’t hesitate to work with architects and designers who specialize in barndominiums for expert advice.
- **Start Small:** If you're overwhelmed, focus on one area at a time, like the kitchen or living room, before moving on to others.

With the right ideas and inspiration, your dream barndominium can become a beautiful reality that suits your lifestyle and preferences. Remember that it’s about creating a space you love to come home to!

### Conclusion

Choosing to live in barndominiums for sale in Texas offers numerous benefits that enhance your lifestyle significantly. The unique blend of rustic charm and modern amenities creates a comfortable and inviting environment that is hard to resist. Not only do these homes provide space and versatility, but they also encourage a connection with the beautiful Texas landscape. Whether you love the idea of hosting family gatherings or simply enjoying a serene morning coffee on your porch, a barndominium can accommodate your vision of home.

When it comes to customization, the possibilities are truly endless. This is where your creativity can shine. You can explore design ideas that reflect your personal style, whether that means sleek, contemporary interiors or cozy, country touches. Consider open floor plans that maximize space and natural light, or decorative elements that incorporate local materials. Your barndominium can be a canvas for your imagination, allowing you to create a living space that feels uniquely yours.

Exploring barndominiums for sale in Texas isn’t just about purchasing a property; it’s about discovering a lifestyle that aligns with your values.

We are planning a trip to Hawaii. Still deciding on time of year to come and where exactly to go. Very interested in going to a coffee plantation. Visiting beaches (especially a black sand beach), snorkeling, being outside and hiking easy hikes. Whale watching. Really badly want to viset Volcano national park. Oh and eating fresh fruit! Baby coconut, fresh pineapple, fresh bananas, dragon fruit, tropical fruit I don't recognize the list goes on.

We don't need fancy accomidation. We're not looking for fancy meals. We'd probably pick up snacks and fruit and we typically get two meals out of one meal out. Cold local beer and cold local pop/fruit juice on the beach in the evening sounds delightful. If we could have accommodation within walking distance of the beach that would be awsome.

1hl6p0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeLuigi/comments/1hl6p0i/confused_on_possible_timeline/,Confused on possible timeline,"Hello everyone. Maybe someone could help me with this. I am reading the federal seal complaint: US vs. LM. It goes through his timeline and doesn’t say anything about him using two forms of transportation to get to the scene. It just says that he uses an e-bike to get to the hotel where the crime was committed and waited an hour at the hotel to commit the crime. I did try to include the link to the federal seal complaint but it wouldn’t let me post because his name was in the link. You can look up “LM federal seal pdf” and it should be the first or second page that comes up on google.

Then if you read the Wikipedia page, their timeline is very different from the federal paper. They state that he leaves the hostil on an e-bike at 5:45am, then gets off the subway at 6:15am, buys coffee and a granola bar at 6:17 then walks two blocks back to the hotel. At 6:39 he’s back at the hotel and shoots ceo at 6:44 (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Brian_Thompson).
I’m confused on which timeline is correct and why the federal court didn’t include everything that Wikipedia is including. According to Wikipedia, he would have only waited five minutes to shoot the ceo. Has anyone seen other conflicting timelines or ideas from news sources?

We started texting more and usually everyday now. We would hangout outside of school doing a ton of stuff like museums, eating out, concerts, coffee, etc. One time which threw me for a loop is that she invited me to see her younger sister middle school play. But nothing really evolved past that and I feel that it's my fear of messing up my current friend group reading the wrong messages thats holding me back from asking her out. This and 2 things first she just got broken up with long term relationship one were marriage was being thrown around and its obvious she is still hung up on it. Second she was talking one time about how and good friend asked her out one time and it kill the relationship for her and it sort of felt like a warning but it wasn't me she was talking too but I was in the car driving.

- **Maple:** A hard and dense wood, maple is excellent for durability and stain resistance.

### Finishing Your Coffee Table

A great finish can elevate your coffee table from ordinary to extraordinary. Common finishing techniques include:

- **Stain:** Enhances the wood's natural color. Choose a shade that complements your decor.
- **Varnish:** Provides a protective layer, ensuring your table lasts longer.
- **Paint:** Ideal if you want a pop of color or a trendy look.

Before applying any finish, always test it on a scrap piece of wood first to see how it looks. This step saves you from unexpected surprises!

### Essential Tools for Woodworking

Before you start your coffee table project, you need to gather the essential tools. Here’s a list of the most important tools to consider:

- **Table Saw:** A table saw is crucial for making precise cuts, especially when working with large sheets of wood.
- **Miter Saw:** This tool helps you make angled cuts, great for creating the frame or decorative elements on your coffee table.
- **Router:** A router is excellent for adding decorative edges to your table, helping to give it a professionally finished look.
- **Drill:** A reliable drill is essential for making holes for screws, dowels, and other fasteners.
- **Sander:** Both handheld and stationary sanders are important for smoothing the surface and edges of your wood.
- **Clamps:** They are necessary for holding pieces tightly together as the glue dries.
- **Measuring Tools:** Having a tape measure and square ensures measurements are accurate, avoiding costly mistakes.
- **Safety Gear:** Always wear safety glasses and ear protection to keep yourself safe while working.

### Key Techniques for Woodworking

Once you have your tools ready, understanding a few key woodworking techniques will enhance your project’s success:

#### 1. Accurate Measurements

Begin with precise measurements. This step is vital to ensure everything fits together correctly. Use a tape measure and a square to double-check your work. A small error in measurement can lead to problems that require a lot of extra work to fix.

#### 2. Choosing the Right Wood

Selecting the appropriate type of wood for your coffee table is critical. Softwoods like pine are easier to work with and perfect for beginners. Hardwoods like oak or cherry are durable and provide great grain patterns but might require more advanced skills.

#### 3. Preparing Your Wood

Before you start cutting, it’s essential to prepare your wood. This includes sanding down rough edges and ensuring each piece is straight. Using a jointer can help you get perfectly flat surfaces.

#### 4. Joinery Techniques

Different joinery techniques can provide strength and aesthetics to your project. Some popular options include:

- **Butt Joints:** Simple and easy to create, but they may require additional reinforcement.
- **Dado Joints:** These offer a strong connection and are great for adding shelves.
- **Mortise and Tenon:** A traditional method that provides great stability for the structure.

#### 5. Finishing Your Coffee Table

Finishing is crucial for protecting your coffee table and enhancing its appearance. Various finishing products exist, such as stains, paints, and sealants. Take your time with this step, applying multiple coats as necessary, and ensure you allow adequate drying time between applications.

### Maintenance for Longevity

Understanding how to maintain your coffee table is essential. Dust regularly, and consider using coasters and placemats to prevent scratches and water rings. Periodically check for loose joints and re-tighten them as needed.

Ordered a hot americano before my shift at work. Sat outside the coffee shop because said coffee shop's air-conditioning is broken.

In comes the thief who looks to be in his mid 30s and says I dropped something. I look down as he grabbed my wallet, but I saw him just in time. Was too late to grab my wallet or his hand, so I splashed my coffee right on his face.

1hl6g24,https://i.redd.it/8ug8ddvlcq8e1.jpeg,An affair with student ( read below) ,"Kareena was a married woman and a mother to a young child. She worked as a teacher at a college, but her life at home was far from perfect. Her husband was distant, and she often felt lonely and unfulfilled in their relationship.

One day, Kareena noticed a new student in her class named Aryan. He was attentive and engaged, always eager to learn and participate. As the weeks went by, Aryan began to show a special interest in Kareena, staying after class to ask her questions and seek her guidance.

At first, Kareena tried to maintain a professional distance, but as her loneliness at home grew, she found herself looking forward to Aryan's attention. He would compliment her teaching style, bring her small gifts, and even offer to help her with her work.

Slowly, Aryan began to fill the void in Kareena's life. He would text her to check in, offer to help with her son, and even surprise her with coffee on tough days. Kareena knew it was wrong, but she couldn't help but feel a sense of happiness and connection with Aryan that she hadn't felt in years.

As their bond grew stronger, Kareena found herself confiding in Aryan about her marital struggles. He listened with empathy and understanding, always offering a shoulder to lean on. Though she knew it was a dangerous path, Kareena couldn't help but feel grateful for the way Aryan had come into her life and filled the gap that had been missing for so long

It was going to be our first Christmas living together. As I was going through the boxes I picked up from my ex’s house, I found the dress I was going to wear if we got married. I also found the silicone rings I was going to propose with in Scotland but got too scared to.

I still carry my half of the matching bunny charms I got us in my bag. I wonder if his is still on his coffee table.

I have a few of his books I borrowed. I can’t bring myself to read them because that means when I finish them, I’ll have to mail them back, and I don’t want to lose anymore of him.

I wish things had made more sense at the time. I was going through a lot, and I think he could tell. But it felt like I was going through everything alone.

I wish we could have worked through our issues and communicated more effectively, maybe even gone to therapy together.

We should be decorating a little tree, choosing recipes to cook, snuggling on the couch, playing games, and watching Leverage.

We recently moved into a new home, where we dedicated two bedrooms, a full bathroom, and a bunch of storage space in the large garage solely to my mom. Her previous arrangements in our last home was one small bedroom and a shared bathroom.

She's all excited about her new digs and we are excited for her. We felt bad that she had very little space in the last house and gave up so much when she moved out of her mobilehome. Now she has much more space. She has set up a living room of sorts in one of her rooms, including a coffee pot, toaster oven and a portable induction burner. This has us concerned from a safety standpoint, so we gave her a small fire extinguisher to keep in her room.

We all get along very well but she is offended by the fire extinguisher. She says we don't trust her and think she's going to start a fire. I told her we have fire extinguishers in the kitchen and the garage because you just never know what might happen. It has nothing to do with trust, it has everything to do with understanding that everyone makes mistakes because we are human. I was very nice about it all but now she's sulking in her room.

1hl6dye,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1hl6dye/am_i_allergic_to_oat_suddenly/,Am I allergic to oat suddenly? ,"Hi guys! So today I had my first allergic reaction ever honestly. 

I was at the salon getting my hair done, and I sent my boyfriend to Dutch bros to get me a coffee, it was just espresso with ice and oatmilk. I took my first few sips and then about 20-30 minutes later I noticed that my hands were really itchy, then I got a couple of bumps on my arms that looked like bug bites and itched, then my face got super hot and red, then my lips started to get a little swollen. At this point I sent my boyfriend to the store to get me some Claritin since I could tell it was an allergic reaction! Thankfully there was a bunch of really nice ladies there helping me, we took off my salon cape and my hairdresser saw I had hives all over my chest and neck! Thankfully soon after my guy came back with the Claritin my symptoms went away. It was so scary though!! 

The only things I had that morning were 

10:40AM: jalapeo corndog
11:15AM: chili cheese corn dog 
(I love corn dogs)

2:00PM(ish): I started drinking my oatmilk espresso
2:20-2:30: my symptoms start
2:55: I take Claritin 

Around 4PM I was completely back to normal, including my lips swelling. 

I think it was the oatmilk I was allergic to, I had espresso yesterday with regular milk and was completely fine! One of my friends think they could’ve not rinsed the espresso cleaner good enough, and that gave me a reaction? 
I’ve had oatmilk in the past and have been completely fine, and oat just seems like such a weird thing to be allergic to. 

Now I’m so scared to eat or drink anything in fear of a worse reaction, I need advice! 😞",2,1735016881.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False
1hl6d18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hl6d18/gag_reflex_from_brushing_teeth_and_drinking_coffee/,Gag reflex from brushing teeth and drinking coffee ,"Age: 29 
Male

History: Smoked pot daily from about 15-23, cigarettes more occasionally while drinking 
- smoked a lot of bongs, ‘blunts’, and joints.
Think it had some long term damage on my esophagus possibly, just a guess.

So, for many years now it seems but more pronounced in the last few, I have a very sensitive gag reflex from certain things. Especially, after I brush my teeth, rinse my mouth out, if any little bit of remnant of toothpaste taste goes back down my throat, it will make me gag, and I’ll have to ‘hock’ it back up. I know, gross, but just trying to explain the situation. Usually I have to have a swig of some sort of flavored drink like juice after brushing, and it sort of coats the remaining toothpaste ish remnants in my mouth, and gets rid of that taste. 

Additionally, whenever I drink coffee now, it reallyyy bothers my gag reflex unlike any other fluid. I’ll make an espresso, or have some drip coffee, and after having my first sips, and it coats my throat, it triggers my gag reflex quickly and consistently. And I can’t seem to find why it’s happening or how to stop it. Like today I drank some espresso with a splash of milk. It causes me to gag and then cough up stuff from the back of my throat to seemingly clear my throat, and then for hour or so after drinking the coffee, I’m still clearing my throat to avoid gagging. 

I know, uniquely weird issue. Curious if anyone has any experience like this, or any tips. 
The reason I added the history is because regrettably I believe that my years of smoking weed did some long term damage on my throat in one way or another. So I thought it was worth mentioning. 

Currently, I am very healthy otherwise and have been for many years, in great shape physically, and generally eat pretty well overall. Low/healthy body fat, exercise daily, rarely drink, etc. ",1,1735016783.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

**Ex-friend 34F asked me 35M about our relationship over 10 years ago.  How to respond?**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Infidelity!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/1mIF0gKtmw)  **March 27, 2024**

So this will be a weird one.  I made a throw away for it as I think this is a pretty unique situation that the person in question could very easily figure out is about them and I don’t want them knowing my main.  If they even use Reddit.  I 35M am happily married with two children.  My wife 32F and I have been together for 8 years married for 4.  We were out shopping in our hometown when we ran into my ex-friend, her parents and her children.  She moved out of state over 10 years ago and I haven’t seen her since nor have we had any contact other than Facebook happy birthday wishes.  She is married with two kids of her own.

Anyway onto the situation.  My FIL and her father are friendly with each other.  Both retired military and occasionally have breakfast together with their other retired friends.  When we ran into each other ex-friends dad congratulated my wife and I.  We figured my FIL told him we’re expecting our third child.  I saw my ex-friend look at my wife’s belly and then acted distant for the rest of the exchange whereas she was friendly starting off.  We trade pleasantries and say good bye.  My wife and I continue about our shopping.  By the time we’re done I check my phone and see I have a Facebook message from ex-friend.

Ex-F “It was good to see you again!”
Me “You too!  The family looks good!”
Ex-F “Yours too! Would you wanna grab coffee and catch up?  I’m in town for a couple more days”
Me “We’re actually pretty busy otherwise I would be down.  I’m sorry”
Ex-F “I understand.  Adulting.  Can I ask you a question?”
Me ”Sure, what’s up?”
Ex-F “Was I just not your type?”
Me “What do you mean”
Ex-F “I’m asking what did I do wrong?”
Me- *Didn’t respond as this was out of no where*
Ex-F “I pursued you for years.  We were inseparable for years and you never gave us a real chance.  I loved you.  Our families loved us.  Our friends loved us together…you just never committed all the way to us. You wouldn’t even have sex with me and I need to know why?  Was I not good enough?  Could you not see yourself married to me and having a family together?”

I didn’t respond and I showed the messages to my wife.  She knows of this girl and my reasoning for her and I growing apart (mostly because we see her family everywhere and she asked).  My wife told me to be honest with her but I’m not sure if that’s right.  It feels mean.  I’m going to give my POV on our friendship and I’m hoping I can get some advice on where to go from here.

Basically she and I met through friends in high school.  I was very interested but she was dating some one at the time.  She ended up asking me out a month or so later and we went on dates and kissed a few times though we never had the conversation on being official (hence me calling her friend and not girlfriend).  One night while riding in the car, her (who I thought was ex) bf called her and asked when she’d be over.  She didn’t have it on speaker but I could still hear the conversation.  She told him “I can’t talk right now” and he asked who she’s with.  She didn’t tell him.  He later figured it out and messaged me on Facebook asking if I knew they were still together.  I apologized and said I didn’t and would cut things off.  I called her and she started crying saying she didn’t have the courage to tell me they were still together but she liked me so much and was going to break up with him.  I cut her off anyway.  Fast forward a few more months and she reaches out and we go through the same motions.  Her wanting to be with me but always having another guy messaging her that I would catch out of the corner of my eye.  This lasted (embarrassingly) years.  Throughout college and our early twenties it was always the same.  She’d reach out, we’d reconnect and things begin getting serious again.  I’d check her social media and see she just broke up with someone.  We even went on vacation to the mountains together for a weekend and the same thing.  She had literally just been there a month ago with her ex(the trip with me was her idea).  The worst part is both our families really did love us together.  My parents were never “rude” to my girlfriends but would ask me how ex-f is doing these days.  Or snide remarks about how her parents miss me.  Hell even my now FIL at one point mentioned that ex’s dad brought up how he really thought I’d be his son one day.  

I confided in my friends years ago that I’m always just a rebound or backup plan and that’s why I could never commit or get more physical with her.  They told me to just sleep with her when she comes calling and don’t pursue anything more.  The problem was I wanted more but felt used.  Anyways, every time we would plan things out where sex was more than likely on the table, I’d see a guy message her or I’d see a post on social media and it just killed my enthusiasm.  When I say that I mean literally.  It crushed my confidence every single time.  One of my best friends told me I didn’t have to pay attention to all that and could’ve just had my fun with her.  Didn’t mean I had to chase a relationship with her knowing I was always a rebound.  That felt shitty to me.  I had other girlfriends here and there but I wanted this girl.  We just clicked, you know?  But it’s like some sort of god damn mystical being was showing me a sign EVERY SINGLE TIME things were going to progress our relationship.  I just didn’t want her to be getting over some one else or having some one on back burner when we’d reconnect.  Maybe that’s my own insecurity but I know how I felt and it didn’t feel good.  So I slowly distanced myself.  After a short amount of time passed I met my wife.  She met her husband and our lives moved on with little to no contact until the other day.


I haven’t responded to the message and it’s been two days.  I was thinking of just lying and saying it’s not her fault or just not responding but my wife is insisting I tell her the whole thing.  I know this is a word wall but I’m honestly conflicted.  I told my wife I was going to ask others for their opinion and I’m considering the internet as my others.

TL;DR ex-friend Facebook messaged me asking why she wasn’t good enough for me after running into each other over 10 years later.  We’re both married with children of our own.  How to respond to her messages?

>OP - she is doing exactly the same thing she always did with you. I would bet all the cash in my wallet if you were able to look into her life her marriage is crumbling or her husband isn't paying enough attention to her. 

>You were the great white whale that got away, and she is trying to test the water to see if you're down to do the same old song and dance. Now, even more of a challenge since you have a happy family and marriage. Don't engage with her, this sounds exactly like the same cycle you described from your young adulthood.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/32ronvWkwl)  **Apr 1, 2024 (4 days later)**


Thank you every one for responses.  I decided to listen to the majority and responded to Ex-Friend “A”.  The response was well received and we chatted the rest of the week and met up on the weekend before Easter.  The short of it is we’re both leaving our partners.  A and I are gonna try this relationship again now that we’ve completely opened up to each other about our true feelings.  Thank you all for the encouragement to do this.  Couldn’t have done it without you.





April fools.  I would never.  The real update is pretty anti climactic unfortunately.  I ended up just never responding to A.  It had already been 5 days by the time I read through every response and decided to just let it go.  My wife was fine with that but told me to block her if she messages again.  We did a couple Easter egg hunts with different family members yesterday including at my FILs.  They have a decent sized property and host quite a few people so I wasn’t surprised to see non-family members.  I was however surprised when A’s parents were there with her children.  After all the adults scattered and hid the eggs and the kids started their search A’s dad came over to chat with me, nothing out of the ordinary, and we shot the shit for a few minutes.  Towards the end I asked if the kids were staying with them for Easter and he basically told me A and her husband were having some troubles and they needed some time alone to sort things out.  He didn’t go into specifics so I don’t know exactly what “troubles” are but congratulations to those of you who called that one.  


For now this should conclude the story.  If she does happen to reach out again and I feel it’s worth letting you all know what it says then I will.  Otherwise thanks again!

TL;DR joke intro.  Saw ex-friends parents and her children at FILs Easter egg hunt.  Her and her husband are having troubles.

>OMG I KNEW IT! I called this on the original post - that she and her husband were having trouble and she was just trying to get the same old ego boost/even more of one because you are clearly very happily married (congrats on the baby btw OP). You win the reddit gold star of the month for handling this like a goddamn hero. You're an excellent husband and your wife is an awesome teammate/badass herself. Good job OP!

>She clearly just needed some attention and even though you were married, had moved on and she'd be a homewreaker, she didn't care. Even asking 'why didn't you want me, waaaaaah' after ten freaking years is obviously fishing for compliments and an ego boost, especially since SHE was the reason you never worked out. Gah, maddening. You did the right thing 100%. 

>Edit: Spelling error that annoyed me.

**OOP**

>>Thank you.  I noticed on the original post you talked about it possibly being competitive.  My wife said the same based on her reaction to the pregnancy news.  Either competitive or possibly fertility issues after two children.  Tbh she’s put a lot more thought into reasoning than I have.

My GI and hematologist were fine with me taking celebrex too, and it gives me very few side effects.

However, my new rheumatologist would really prefer I get off the NSAIDs. She started me on Humira, my first biologic, however after 9 months of taking Humira now, I find that it's somewhat effective on day1-6 after the injection and then not much day 7-14. And even for those first 6 days, it doesn't work well enough that I could drop the Celebrex. 

Once in a while I try to go off celebrex for a few days, and it's not like I'm in agonizing pain or anything. But I can feel the inflammation. My body feels heavy, I'm tired no matter how much coffee I drink, can't think clearly, I feel depressed and anxious. Then I take celebrex and those things go away.

The obvious answer seems to be to try a different biologic. Unfortunately, since I am limited to only a few others - Cimzia, Remicade, Stelara - the doc is reluctant for me to switch to a different biologic and use up all my options too quickly.

If celebrex has been working for me daily for the last 4 years, how bad is it to just keep taking?",2,1735016392.0,ankylosingspondylitis,2,0.75,False

He used to scream and throw stuff at my mom and older sister. One of my earliest memories is him screaming at my sister and throwing hot coffee on her face. I remember just getting a towel and cleaning all of the coffee that was on the walls and floor. I was terrified of him targeting me next so I would stay quiet and try to be useful.

My dad gave me unrestricted internet access. He would download any game he thought looked fine for me to play. When I was about 8 years old he ended up downloading a NSFW game just because he saw the anime girl and didn't look more into it. He walked in on there being lewd girls on my screen and just laughed it off and left. I would also play multiplayer games and could talk to people. At 8 years old I had my first online boyfriend, which he found out about but even though he had me cut ties with that boy he still let me have unrestricted access. I would have secret online friends and have apps I would secretly talk to them on. I became addicted to being on my phone or laptop at a young age because I had so many online friends. My family didn't notice because I stayed quiet about it and stayed out of trouble.

I was 11 years old when I first started to cut myself. Both of my arms were fully covered in cuts. I would just always wear long sleeves and nobody noticed. Since I had 2 cats and 1 dog if somebody noticed a small cut on my wrist I could easily pass it off as one of my pets.  
11 I would have online friends, some cared about me, some played with my heart. Some were too old to be my friend. I was dating a 16 year old until my sister found out by snooping through my phone. She made me block him. I remember he had multiple siblings and said that the one that was 10 years old he was closest with and we would probably be friends. I didn't realize how wrong this was until years later.  
11 years old I would start sexting people. Usually they would be around the same age as me, but they sometimes would be older. I would do all of this on apps that you would usually see a kid on. So whenever my family saw I was on the app they would never ask questions. I was on the side of the app that wasn't safe for children though. It would have a community of people my age, also online too young, all as traumatized as I was. It would also have older people, pretending they were safe adults for us, or sometimes pretending they were the same age. The app was called Wishbone. I will never forget that app. I did meet some amazing people who I still have contact with. But I also met older teenagers that would expose me to loads of sexual things.  
When i was 11 I remember thinking ""if theyre a teenager they cant be a pedophile, theyre just a little older so its okay."" and that would lead to me getting manipulated by so many people. All because I thought 11 and 15+ was an okay age difference to have romantic intentions with.

During middle school was when my family issues started to get really bad. I had friends that lived near me so I wasn't online nearly as often. I had a few close online friends that I would often text, I had a secret instagram account, but overall it was nothing like before. I would be out every single day though. My mom resented my dad after all those years of abuse and quit talking to him. My dad would slowly start to manipulate my sister into feeling sorry for him. She then realized he abused her too and she shouldn't view him as innocent and also quit talking to him. My dad would also start to grow and sell weed. He would also smoke it. Slowly my house started to smell like weed everyday. My mom was only talking to my dad if necessary and my sister wouldn't talk to my dad at all. She would eat dinner before everybody else so she didn't have to see him. I would soon start to see my 8th grade English teacher as a male model in my life. He was nice to me, he noticed the days I was silent, his classroom was the one I felt safest in.  
My memory of this time is sitting at a dinner table with my mom and dad. All eating in complete silence. With the room dark. And just the TV playing, the only thing that would make sound in that entire house.

Covid19 would hit in the march of that year. I was 13. Lockdown started. The tension in the house was horrible. My mom saw an opportunity though. She knew houses would be cheaper, everything would be cheaper, that it would easier to move out. She took the opportunity and divorced my dad. He was heartbroken and tried to stop it. I would watch my dad cry. I would be happy at the same time to know my family life won't continue like this. I didn't know how to feel.  
One day my mom decided to move out when my dad was at work. He came home to me and my sisters bedrooms empty, all of her clothes and belongings gone, a little bit of the furniture but not much. My mom simply said we're moving out now and nothing will be changed. That this is it. I saw my dad immediately cry. I saw the man who acted so strong and powerful finally break down knowing he was helpless and nothing he could do would change it. He asked me to stay with him in the house for a few more hours so I did. I didn;t know what to do or say.

Moving into a new house with almost nothing was fun. Using the boxes as tables while we waited for furniture to come in. Sitting on the floor watching TV. Slowly watching our house turn into our new home. In the back of my mind though I couldn't forget my dad. That one day we left. My dad didn't text or call us for a few months.  
Me and my sister started to bond. We would play minecraft together every night. Every time we heard a creek from upstairs we would go dead silent in fear. We were so used to being too loud at night would lead to us being yelled at, and possibly punished in some way. It took about a year to not react in fear every time we heard the floors creek upstairs.  
I also wasn't able to eat. Every time it was dinner and we were eating, my mom and sister would be happily taking. But I would just remember that my dad is alone eating while we're enjoying ourseleves. I felt guilty. It made it where I couldnt eat. I slowly started to eat less and less. I would end up loosing about 30 pounds within just a couple of months. My BMI would probably be 16 during this time. To this day I havent been able to regain the weight. It tooks month into visiting my dad again. I would always feel uncomfortable visiting him because the house that was once my childhood home looked nothing like a house I ever lived in.  
During quarantine I met a boy online. He would become an online friend, and soon an online boyfriend. He was almost 3 years older than me. This boy was a pathological liar. He would constantly make up lies, constantly lust over other girls, whether it was on instagram or in their dms. He would also force me into sending nudes to him. Making me feel like a bad person if I didnt. I was 13 when I first sent. I was uncomfortable and would always say no but he would tell me to do it and pressure me. He soon turned 16 and shortly after I would turn 14. This man would constantly make me feel as if I was crazy. Switching up his stories, love bombing and then hurting. Constantly lying and when I caught him he'd make me feel at fault. Cutting him off was such a relief. He would try to come back into my life months later but I shut him out. 4 years later he followed my instagram account again but i removed him.

I remember shortly after that the schools were half open and half online still. I went in person and started to become close friends with people. In summer of 2021 also met online a boy, who later introduced me into his friend group. I still talk to them this day. things started to get better. I will always miss that summer. The only sad thing I can think about is the boy i first met cut me and everyone off for a little. It made me extremely sad. He came back to the friend group though. he was truly my best friend during that time.

I turned 15 and then started my sophmore year of highschool. Very quickly I met a boy. I was so excited to finally meet a boy I liked and he went to the same school as me. We were quick to date. I was stupid. After our first kiss he quickly got sexual and he was my first boyfriend so I was excited and okay with it. He would take my virginity in the car. It was my first time so of course I was bleeding. But he just wanted to hurry up and move onto the next activity. He didn't care I was hurt. He would also quickly dump me. I was heartbroken. I thought we were special because I had sex with him. Just a few days later I saw him and he was already dating a new girl. During this time a boy in my friend group saw the opportunity to confess his feelings to me. I was trying to move on and thought maybe this was the better move. I didnt fully reject him but he did know I wasnt ready to date yet. After a little my ex came back to me asking to date me again. Since this was the boy that took my virginity I took him back. he would later on take my phone, call the boy that liked me, and show him I was with him. I was ashamed of myself for using a friend to try and get over an ex and then letting my boyfriend do that. I left the friendgroup and I refused to talk to anyone from it for months. It took them reaching out to me multiple times for me to get the courarge to face them again.  
Dating this boy was okay. Until he started to act the exact same as he did before. He broke up with me again. I decided to move on and met a kind boy. My ex saw and was pissed. He kept trying to get me back while I was slowly falling for this new boy. Although my ex did have my virginity. So I ended up cutting it off with the new boy and after 2 months got back with my ex. My ex also lived near my dads house so often when I was at my dads house he would be there with me. It gave me an even worse attachment to him because I felt better about being at my dads house when he was there.

In between the break up and getting back together though I did meet my two online friends from the summer of 2021. I felt so comfortable with them so fast. I was so happy.

Junior year I was with the same boy. Except at this point we were both extremely toxic to each other. We would date for the rest of the school year. We would have small breakups and get back together often. He would SA me often, and I thought it wasn't SA because I was his girlfriend. Even if I said no he wouldn't stop until i said yes. There would be multiple times of him trying to get intimate while I was sleeping. I would also initiate sex with him if I wanted to feel his love. Because I felt the most loved during sex. Because of his past actions I would feel so insecure of other women. I would often cut my self again from feeling so overwhelmed with my own emotions with dating him. Sometimes i would dig into my skin and rip out chunks of it. I would also rip out of own hair. After a while I decided to go to therapy.

The summer after junior year I would go to Japan as a exchange student program. My host family was a lovely family and I became close to them. One of the kids from my school that also went to Japan we would slowly become close.

Dating my ex I slowly quit to care about his feelings because he showed me time and time again that he didnt care for mine.

I started my senior year. I was 17 now. Within the first weekend of senior year I had to go to the hospital. It turns out I had a kidney infection in both of my kidneys. I couldn't go to school. The senior year I was looking forward to suddenly came crashing down. I started to become extremely depressed.  
One night I had my ex visit me and he was too tired from gaming the previous night and working that day that he was too tired to even do anything we planned. He left my house early just to play more video games. It started another fight but finally I decided I was done. I blocked him everywhere and knew I was done with him. I was free from him.

My senior year I had to switch to online school. Even though my kidneys were healed I was extremely depressed. I didn't want to leave my bed or my bedroom. I just wanted to stay home. Never go outside.

I started to spend days online again. I would talk to people online way more than anybody I knew in real life. My two best friends were concerned and would usually visit me once every week or two. They knew I was struggling even though I wouldnt open up to them about it. They just hoped that they knew they were still there for me.

I started to get constantly sexualized. Some men would even pay me money. Due to my history of being sexually assaulted and groomed online I was okay with it. I knew it was bad, I knew it was something I shouldn't of allowed. I was still a minor at the time but I let it all happen. At this point in time the only thing I wanted to do was die. I didn't care about anything in my life. I didn't care if i got leaked, i didnt care if i got stalked, i didnt care about anything. I was just enjoying the fact I felt wanted. Even if it was only for my body. I didnt care about anything. I loved knowing that men wanted me. Even though my mind was messed up at least I was pretty enough for them to want my body. At this point in time I could get anybody I wanted. They wouldnt be able to say no to their lust and I would be able to get them to want me back.

My host family from Japan would come to visit me in America. It was winter during this time. I had fun at first but it was too much for me to handle after a couple of days and I started to isolate myself from them. I couldn't handle it.

After they left the habit of sexualizing myself continued. I still didnt care. about what happened to me. Eventually I would date this boy for a little but I soon broke up with him. His mental health was worse than mine and I couldnt do it.

I made friends with these people and they were all pdf. One of the older guys wanted me and didn't care whether I was younger or older, as long as I look how I look. I felt a guilty pleasure from knowing I was wanted even if it wasnt legal. I would end up exposing him and he would attempt to take his life. I ended up leaving that friend group too. Most of the guys there were defending him.

I'm 18 now. I started to date a boy just a few days after my birthday. He's a sweet boy. He helped me realize some issues I have with myself. Doing that made me obsessed with him. I would carve his initial into my skin. I was obsessed. He helped me realize it was unhealthy.

I would soon go to Japan which is where I currently am.

I want to die again. The last few months I feel useless again. I realized I want a child. I want my own baby that has to completely rely on me. I want to be a provider. I want somebody to need me to help them live. I know it's not very healthy but if I am not providing for somebody I feel as if there is no point in living a life. While I've been in japan I have relapsed and cut myself countless amounts of times. I've started to romanticize it and find the cuts pretty. I just want to die. Im so tired of living. I dont think life will get better, I dont think my depression will get cured, I think im doomed to live a life like this. I wonder if I will even live to get married.

I honestly hope I die from something instead of my own hand so my family doesnt feel guilt.",1,1735016166.0,u_Miko8226,0,1.0,False

I've yet to actually get a response from anyone on this sub so thought l'd go ahead and make my own post and see if my luck changes
Looking for my other half who is also someone I would consider to be my best friend.

I am in Las Vegas hispanic (both my parents are Mexican but I was born in the states, San Diego) 5'9"", 220lbs, brown eyes, No tattoos nor piercings (it's fine to me if you do, but those aren't things I want for myself).

I rarely drink, I don't smoke, I don't vape, and I don't do drugs. Tried them once or twice but never again. I can handle it if you drink so long as it is infrequent or for special occasions or something, but smoking, vaping, and drugs are absolute deal breakers.

Spent most of my 20s working a lot of jobs. I was trying to figure what I wanted and what I can be good for. Worked in construction, restaurants, coffee shops, welding, handyman, auto mechanic, school teacher, office jobs. I’m glad I did all of that because I learned just about anything in any field. 

I used to work on a ship for national geographic as a sous chef. I made breads, deserts, appetizers, crew meals. It’s more of a fill in job. I do have a fulltime job at another ship. Doing the exact same thing. I love it because I get to travel a lot and save a lot of money on rent and bills. 
Since I work on ships I’m almost never in Vegas. I’m always somewhere else. Either in San Diego or in Mexico with my parents. I do work 6 weeks on and 6 weeks off. So dating for me is hard, I understand many can’t do that. And that’s ok.

I am a dual Mexican/American citizenship. I am currently buying a house in Mexico with my parents. I plan to start up my own family style restaurant/ coffee shop in Mexico.
I do go to Mexico often because that’s where my parents live I go about 3-4 times a year. They can’t come to the US. So that’s like an important thing for me. 

I'm not too picky or into much about music, but mostly right now I listen to techno or Hans Zimmerman soundtracks. 

I listen to podcasts, usually educational or self improvement type stuff... usually as something to do while l'm out alone on a walk.

I do want kids/ family one day. 

I do ask you to be honest. For example If there’s something you don’t like about me, tell me and we can solve that problem. Vice versa. I’m not here to play games or anything. I just want to have a partner that is willing to go on trips with me and have a good time. 

I’m a very active person, hobby wise I like to go on hikes, and biking, I also like to go camping. I like to drive very far and go to new cities or parks and just explore and see what’s new to me. And photograph mountains, beaches, sunsets.
I have like 4 cameras so I really like to take photos of everything, even though I still forget to take them. I’m just enjoying the moment haha

Before I worked on a ship, about 2 years ago. I wanted to know more of my body, basically what it could handle. What I mean is I went vegan for 7 months and I lost 60lbs. I also sold my car and I was riding my bike 20-30miles a day. I also fasted a lot. Most I ever did was 5 days. It may not be super interesting but for me it was like a life changing time for me. 

I’m not really into politics, if I had to consider which way I’m leaning would be more on the right. I also believe in God. But I’m open to anyone. I have friends on both sides and atheists who are really close and good friends to me. 
we can go into deep into my views I’m sure it’ll be interesting.

I think I'm pretty funny and sarcastic, though I don't think that's really showing here... come chat with me though and maybe we will see

I am pretty introverted but I’m not a shy person. I only say what I need or want to say. I don’t talk just to talk. And I listen more than I talk. So if you’re someone who talks a lot I don’t mind that. I also like learning from other people. 
I open up a lot more the more comfortable I get.

I’m not really picky but I prefer someone 21-35, no kids, white, Hispanic, Asian someone who lives in the US or Europe, I’d love to go to Europe.

Maybe it's a crazy coincidence, maybe I'm just making it up because I want it to be true, who knows. But I think Roaring Kitty left us clues about switching to TLRY in his last YouTube live video from June. Here's why: 

1. At 8:35 he starts by saying, ""you gotta do the switch"". He's talking about switching from coffee to beer, but anyone who knows this guy knows he's talking in code because the feds are always watching him. He then goes on to say, ""It's time to make a switch"".  
2. He then holds up a can of beer, but the green screen causes you to not be able to see it because the can itself is entirely the color green. He continues by saying, ""Can you see it? That's a hint but you can't see it."". You're able to make out the word ""Green"" on the bottom of the can, which he later confirms with his chat. 
3. I looked it up, and it's a beer called ""Green"" made by the brewing company, Treehouse Brewing Company. Green? Trees? AKA, WEED. Also, this might be a stretch, but the acronym for this company is basically THC...just saying. 
4. TLRY has been acquiring a bunch of craft brewing companies for the past couple of years. It's very possible that they could be in the works of acquiring Treehouse. Maybe he knows about this somehow?

I think his YouTube video was just a way for him to very subtly tell everyone that he is going to switch to a new stock. Throughout the video he kept saying, ""reserve the right to change your mind"", and I think he's referring to changing from GME to TLRY. He later shows his GME positions, and he was holding a ton of calls with a $20 strike that expired on 6/20. Maybe he rolled them, maybe he executed them, who really knows. But I think he knew he was going to cash them out and take a new position on a different stock...TLRY.

As a young 22 year old, I was excited to be an intern after college at a resort in Andaman. It was the lean season and my friend's father owned the resort. He practically made me incharge of most things, considering their lack of funds to manage it. 

Despite the weak pay, I loved my job. I did it with passion and sincerity. It was a rainy night as usual and I was tallying the accounts in the cafe. We had one or two people in the resort, sitting at the cafe, sipping coffee when Miss/ Mrs. ______ , one of the most famous actresses in town, a siren and a sweetheart walks in. She was dripping in rain and was on vacation to heal herself after a string of flops and a divorce. She was looking to heal herself and have some fun too, being lonely for quite a while now. 

And here starts a hot game that takes us around the island. Your character could ask me to be your tour guide- take you to caves, take you on boat rides, swim together in the beach and go on cafe dates.

There are instructions for how much coffee to use depending on the water level, with the maximum being sixty cups... but to clarify, that doesn't mean sixty 8-oz US cups. They mean that the maximum fill level for the machine will dispense sixty cups of coffee, with each cup measuring 5.3 fluid ounces. Okay, that's fine, weird way to do it but whatever... the problem is, for the amount of ground coffee you should use, the instructions also uses ""cups"" as a measurement

The reason that this is confusing is because they use fractions, and other measurements. For example, to make twenty cups of coffee, they advise to use 1 cup + 1 tbsp to 1 1/3 cups of grounds. I don't know anyone who has a measuring cup that will allow them to easily measure out 1/3 of 5.3 fluid ounces, so I can only assume that the instructions mean US cups here... but it doesn't actually SAY that.

Now, I’m ready for the next chapter: marriage, kids, and all the joys (and surprises) that come with creating a family.

I don’t smoke or do drugs, but I’m definitely into a strong cup of coffee, the occasional drink, and staying active. My downtime is never dull—you’ll find me scuba diving, experimenting with new recipes, tackling DIY projects (I renovated my entire house solo), or out boating. Family is a cornerstone of my life, and I believe in living healthy and making the most of every moment.

I’m looking for someone kind, grounded, and emotionally steady—ideally in her 20s or early 30s—who shares my vision of a loving family and a bright future. If you’re ready for adventure, laughter, and building something amazing together, I’d love to hear your story.",0,1735014424.0,r4r,1,0.4,False
1hl5p8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1hl5p8d/losing_my_mind_with_a_brand_new_brikka/,Losing my mind with a brand new Brikka,"Hello. I'm joining the ranks of people who have likely fucked up a brand new Brikka, but I'm hoping someone here can help me. I just unboxed this thing tonight and went to do the customary ""three wasted brews"" in order to get it ready for tomorrow morning. I bought and used Illy brand ground espresso, the one in the round tin, because (unless I'm remembering badly) the docs in the box say to use Moka-ground coffee. 

I ran it the first time through with water only, as instructed. No issues. I ran one brew with the Illy grounds (not tamped, not packed, about 100 ml of water for a 2-cup Brikka). No problems. Tossed the first batch of coffee. Went to do a second brew. Got caramelized drips at the bottom of the top part once I realized it smelled like burning. Took it apart, cleaned it all out. Tried a third brew with the same grounds. Got absolutely nothing. Took it all apart again, cleaned it all out again, tried a fourth run with water only. Got maybe 10-20 ml of water in the bottom before it started steaming out the valve like crazy. 

I suspect there are grounds trapped in the valve at the top, as I can't find them anywhere else. I've seen a different post that says you can unscrew the top valve. Is that the right idea? Is there another way to unclog the valve? Should I send it back to Amazon for a new one? Should I soak the valve over night to see if the stuck grounds will release themselves? Is that something that can happen? Should I send it back? I'm going out of my mind. What kind of coffee can I even use in this thing? I **like** the roasts of the Italian brands, and they tend to come in this fine espresso grind. Should I ditch the Brikka for the normal Moka Pot? I'm so frustrated and I just want it to work. My boyfriend is visiting me in the US from Italy and I wanted to give him a fun Brikka experience, and now I feel like a proper wad. ;( TIA for any help. ",3,1735014344.0,mokapot,4,1.0,False

1hl5ndf,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentsofmultiples/comments/1hl5ndf/toddler_twins_terrible_twos_ah/,Toddler twins terrible twos ah!!!!! ,"We are at the thick of it with our twins being 2.5 and OMG now I know what the meaning of “double trouble” and “terrible twos” is. They are just so mentally and physically draining!!! I also have an older G who is 5 and she NEVER did anything like that. This is a whole new territory for me! 
Getting out of the house is always a huge struggle. Getting everyone ready, and out the door literally takes forever.  When we finally do go out it’s a relief as if they stay home they basically destroy everything. So outside is needed but then taking all 3 kids out on weekends on holidays also takes forever! For the past 2 years I had them trained napping and sleeping on the same schedule. But @/lately they have been napping different schedules. Like today they napped in the stroller and my older one also was lying down and tired and for 5 glorious minutes all 3 were napping. And then five minutes lately my twin girl wakes up and is wiiide awake and refusing to go back to bed saying NO DODO (sleep).   When clearly she is suuuuper tired. Then my oldest got up and she was awake. So nope didn’t have any time to myself until not they are all finally asleep. My twin boy was the only one who actually slept for his nap. Then the question goes do I wake him? Do I let him sleep? And in my head I’m like well 2 is better then 3 kids awake so in my twin mom math I let him sleep.  

Also, The twins seem to take turns having their tantrums and now my boy is super easygoing (which for the past 2 years was NOT the case) but man my twin girl loves the word no. And not like a “ no Mama” but a “NOOO super loud like she’s talking on a megaphone. Like where did she learn that??? Her other new thing is refusing to eat anything that isn’t milk or any type of snack/dessert. It’s insane! I know it’s a power thing and asserting her dominance but man is it ever so draining. 

I’m trying my best to be present for them and come from a place of understanding that they are two and it’s good that they are growing and asserting their dominance and developing to their own person but also OMG ITS A LOT. And then I got down the bad anxiety spiral of how did I end up here as a twin mom ??? I never in a million years thought I would be a twin mom but here we are. My first born was SO easy as a child and this is like night and day complete opposite. It’s like I’m in this upside down world going through a rollercoaster of obstacles and emotions with no end in sight. Ugh. I love them and can’t imagine my life without them but man does it take out a lot from me. Not to mention I can’t leave them alone for one second. In the last 6 months They have already broken our microwave and caused a small fire (twin boy), broken our coffee machine (both), climbed up on the counter and found the hidden chocolate (twin girl), went into my bag and ate the leftover candy (both), caused so many messes I’ve lost count. 
The hardest is when one of them or both doesn’t nap and you’re left counting down the hours until bed time. But then when bedtime rolls around you finally get a moment to yourself and then five minutes later fall asleep. This is on days you DONT work mind you like now we are on Christmas break. It’s also hard with 3, even with big sis being so great and sweet and a great big sister we are still outnumbered and left scrambling with the three.

Any advice on how to handle this stage??? I heard 3 is better but how do I survive until then??! Any tips would be super appreciated. ",1,1735014140.0,parentsofmultiples,2,0.67,False
1hl5n60,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hl5n60/the_amount_of_flys_at_my_house_is_literally/,The amount of Flys at my house is literally driving me insane. ,"My partner and I relocated abroad almost a year ago to be close to family.  
When the location for our newly built house was picked, we were unaware of the problem we would have with Flys. 
Our property is surrounded by chicken farms. When we visited the property there wasn't an issue. 
It wasn't until we actually moved that we discovered how big of a problem this is. 

When the chickens are being transported for about 3 weeks at a time, the trucks drive by our house and countless Flys come with them. 
Then we get about a week where the numbers die down until the next round of transport. 

We have tried everything you can possibly think of to keep the Flys out of the house. But literally, there are hundreds. Even if we bug bomb the house, they are back in the hundreds within hours. 

I have spent countless hours zapping literally hundreds of Flys with a racket. We have bug zappers in every room. And yet there are still tons of Flys everywhere. I've stuffed every nook and cranny with rags to block them from getting into my office, and yet they still manage to get in. 

They die in my coffee every morning. 

They fly in my mouth when I eat or drink. 

They crawl on my ass when I take a shit. 

They crawl all over us 24/7.

Even when I shower, they land all over me. 

They swarm in the kitchen when we cook and land on food and utensils. 

I have to cover my food between bites and fight off Flys as I move the food from my plate to my mouth for nearly every bite. 

They fly into the refrigerator and freezer then die all over the place. 

They land on my glasses and face while I'm working, on camera in front of hundreds of professionals. 

If I'm not wearing glasses they fly into my eye. 

They get stuck in my hair.

They try to fly in my ears.

The land on my book when I'm reading.

They land on my phone when I'm using it. (Like right TF now)

They are in the car when I leave and land on my face, glasses and ears while driving. 

The sound of the collective buzz of hundreds of Flys is constant and it's literally driving me absolutely mad.

Every minute of every day this is happening,  with the exception of about one week per month. I've tolerated this for almost a year. I've done hours upon hours of research and tried every possible remedy, natural and chemical but can't get relief. 
I recently enclosed the entire back porch and pool area with a screen and structure but they are managing to still find their way in through the smallest gaps. 

I am literally at my wits end. I am not usually an easily angered person but I'm finding myself in a constant bad mood and having bursts of anger. At first just burst of letting out a frustrated growl. Now I'm to the point where im constantly clenching my teeth and using every remaining sliver of self-control not to break every dish they land on, slam every door I pass through, or throw my phone at the nearest wall. I find myself with destructive thoughts and fear that one day I will snap.

I even had a 3 week break from this when I visited back home for Thanksgiving. Literally the highlight of my trip wasn't seeing my family or home country. It wasn't the food. It was literally having a break from Flys.
