**Arras Minerals Corp. $ARRKF $ARK.V**

Market Cap: 71M

Company Overview

Arras Minerals is exploring for copper and gold in Northeastern Kazakhstan. Their Elemes project covers a massive land package in a legit mining district with solid infrastructure, including paved roads, rail, and cheap power. Over the last few years, they’ve locked in two big copper targets at Berezski and Aimandai, using soil sampling, geophysics, and old drill data to piece together the story.

**Highlights**

I had to include this one because just yesterday after market close Arras dropped some massive drill results from their Berezski target, the stock is up like 30% today. They hit **547 meters of mineralization at 0.70% copper equivalent, starting just 14 meters from surface.** That’s a thick, near-surface hit, which makes mining cheaper if it ever gets to production since there’s no need for deep, expensive shafts. That’s crazy good results.

The deeper parts of this hole showed signs of a porphyry system (a type of large copper deposit that can support big, long-life mines). They also hit strong mineralization a kilometer west in another hole, suggesting this system could be much bigger than originally thought. They’re still in the early days, but they now have a clearer direction for Phase 2 drilling.

After this news, Arras is probably raising money soon, and it wouldn’t be shocking if they do it at a premium. With results like these, another major investor like Teck could step in. It is just hard not to look at this and think it’s absurdly cheap. ATEX Resources has similar holes and sits at a $600M market cap.

Plus, the Elemes project sits in a legit mining district, close to Kazakhstan’s Bozshakol copper mine, which pumps out over 100,000 tonnes of copper a year at low costs. Arras benefits from the same cheap power, paved highways, and rail connections that help make mining in this area viable.

On top of Berezski, they’ve got a second big target at Aimandai, which is even larger at 14 kilometers. They paused work on it last year to focus on Berezski, but now that they’re seeing promising results, they’re planning to go back and start drilling there too.

Arras has a joint venture with Teck Resources, a major mining company, that’s funding exploration across a separate land package. This gives them multiple shots at making a discovery, with a well-funded partner backing part of the work.

**Happy Belly Food Group Inc. $HBFGF $HBFG.CN**

Market cap: 144M

Company Overview

Happy Belly Food Group is a growing restaurant and food retail company focused on scaling multiple brands across Canada. They’re building a strong portfolio of quick-service restaurant franchises, steadily expanding store count and locking in prime real estate deals.

I know most people in this subreddit mostly want plays that can give them an insta 10x. Well, this is not that, but if you are more of an investor than trader, I can see this one running 5-10x over the next few years.

**Highlights**

Happy Belly has honestly been executing flawlessly, and the market has definitely noticed that. The stock is up nearly 200% over the last year, and looking at the growth, it’s easy to see why. They’ve been rapidly expanding their footprint, locking in real estate deals, and stacking up franchise agreements while keeping capital costs low.

Their latest Q3 numbers were strong. Revenue came in at $2.54M, up 69% from last year. A big chunk of that growth is coming from franchise fees and royalties, which are high-margin and scale naturally as more locations open. System-wide sales from all their franchise locations hit $8.5M, a 488% increase from last year. At this rate, every quarter is setting a new company record.

Since those results, they’ve kept the momentum going. They now have 421 contractually committed locations across all brands, meaning there’s a huge pipeline of stores set to open through 2025 and 2026. They’ve also secured prime mall real estate with Cadillac Fairview, landing spots for IQ Foods, Heal Wellness, and Rosie’s Burgers in high-traffic shopping centers.

They’re making a big push in breakfast, signing a multi-unit franchise deal for Yolks. This comes at the perfect time, as demand for premium breakfast spots keeps growing. On top of that, they recently acquired Smile Tiger Coffee Roasters, giving them a branded coffee lineup they can integrate into their restaurant network and retail business.

Happy Belly has been raising capital at a premium, something you don’t see often in penny stocks. That signals real confidence from investors, and the company is putting that money to work, expanding at a pace that’s rare in this space.

With record-breaking sales, a stacked pipeline of new locations, and a business model built for aggressive scaling, it’s no surprise the stock has been ripping. Looking forward to EOY results in May! 

Also, if you care to look, their CEO Sean Black is active on X and always flexing the long ass lines at their grand openings. 

**Forge Resources Corp. $FRGGF $FRG.CN**

Market cap: 83M

**Company Overview**

Forge Resources is a junior miner (another one ikik) that’s actually doing something different. Most of these small mining companies just burn cash drilling for years, hoping for a big discovery while constantly diluting shareholders. Forge, on the other hand, is working toward actual cash flow. They’ve got a fully permitted coal project in Colombia that’s on the verge of generating revenue, and they’re using that as a financial backbone to fund exploration instead of relying on endless fundraising.

I like Forge’s approach. Most of the time, investing in penny stocks is just investing in stories. I really like FRG’s story and think others will start to buy into it as well as they continue to develop this columbia property.

**Highlights**

I wanted to bring this one up because the stock has been gettin accumulated heavily recently and just broke above a dollar today after announcing it’s finalizing its acquisition of a 60% stake in the La Estrella coal mine. This is a big move because it locks in more control over what could be a cash-flowing asset in the near term.

La Estrella is fully permitted and set to produce coal this year. They’re kicking things off with a 20,000-tonne bulk sample that’s expected to bring in around $4M CAD. A lot of juniors take bulk samples without a clear plan for selling it, but Forge already has LOIs in place with buyers. That means they’re not just pulling coal out of the ground hoping someone wants it, they’ve got a direct path to revenue.

The mine has a mix of metallurgical and thermal coal. The metallurgical side is key because it’s used for making steel, and there’s no real substitute for it. The thermal side still has a market in developing countries that rely on coal for power. Since they’re producing both, they can adjust sales depending on where demand is stronger.

The setup here is solid. The mine has good infrastructure with road and rail access, plus a direct route to the Santa Marta port for exports. Production costs are expected to be around CAD $46 per tonne, and they anticipate selling their coal for CAD $200 to $250 per tonne, depending on market conditions. Even at the lower end, that’s a solid margin.

Outside of La Estrella, they also have the Alotta gold-copper project in the Yukon. I won’t go too deep into it here, but the key thing is they’ve hit mineralization in every hole drilled so far, which doesn’t happen often. They’ve got a bigger drill program lined up this year to see how big the system could be.

Plus, another sign of confidence is that in their most recent private placement, the ceo chucked in $500k and grabbed around 13% of the offering.

1io0bzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCoffeeTables/comments/1io0bzs/vasagle_ulet040b02_coffee_table_set_review/,"VASAGLE ULET040B02 coffee table set review: stylish, sturdy, and compact design","I’ve been using the VASAGLE ULET040B02 coffee table set for a couple of weeks now, and it has quickly become a staple in my living room. This set includes two round coffee tables, one slightly smaller than the other, designed for compact spaces. The greige and ink black color combination caught my attention right away—it's modern yet warm, fitting seamlessly into a variety of decor styles.

The design and craftsmanship are impressive for the price range. The tabletops are made of engineered wood, which mimics the appearance of natural wood grain, while the base is constructed from alloy steel. Together, these materials create a sturdy yet lightweight structure, making the tables easy to move around. I’ve already repositioned them multiple times for different setups—one as a coffee table and the other as a side table next to my armchair. With straight legs and a geometric touch, the aesthetic leans modern and minimalist, but it wouldn’t look out of place in a more rustic or eclectic living room either.

The size is both a strength and a limitation, depending on your needs. The larger table measures 19.7 inches in diameter and 15.7 inches in height, while the smaller one is 15.7 inches in diameter and 14.2 inches high. These dimensions work great for tighter spaces or as accent pieces, but they might feel undersized if you’re looking to use them as the main centerpiece of a larger room. For my small apartment, they’re just right. I’ve even used the smaller table as a makeshift laptop stand, and it held up well.

[Check VASAGLE ULET040B02 price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product/vasagle-ulet040b02-review-b09lymwwwj/)

In terms of storage and stability, the tables are surprisingly robust for their weight. Each can support up to 44 pounds, which is more than enough for drinks, books, and decorative items. However, one slight drawback is the fact that the tabletops aren’t permanently attached to the bases. While this feature allows for easy cleaning and customization, it also means they can shift slightly if bumped. I’ve had to be cautious when my nieces are around since they love climbing on everything. On the plus side, the steel frame ensures the tables don’t wobble, even on my slightly uneven flooring.

Maintenance has been a breeze. The engineered wood surface, while not stain-resistant, is easy to clean with a damp cloth. I’ve tested it with both coffee spills and some crayon marks courtesy of my nephew, and both came off without a hitch. That said, I’ve started using coasters for drinks to avoid any potential long-term damage.

Assembly was straightforward and took me less than 20 minutes. The instructions were clear, and all parts were labeled. I appreciated the inclusion of spare screws, which is always a thoughtful touch. For someone who’s not the most skilled at DIY projects, this was a major plus.

**Pros**

* Stylish and modern design that complements various decor styles.
* Compact size perfect for small spaces or apartments.
* Easy to assemble with clear instructions and spare parts.
* Durable materials with a sturdy steel frame and engineered wood top.
* Lightweight and portable, making it easy to rearrange.

**Cons**

* Tabletops are not permanently attached to bases, which can be inconvenient.
* Smaller size may not suit those needing a larger coffee table.
* Surface not stain-resistant, requiring extra care for drinks and spills.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other coffee table sets in this price bracket, the VASAGLE ULET040B02 stands out for its clean, minimalist design and versatility. For example, similar products like the Furinno Simple Design Coffee Table often lack the same level of aesthetic appeal and sturdiness. While Furinno offers affordable options, their tables tend to feel more lightweight and less durable over time. Another competitor, the Walker Edison Modern Round Nesting Coffee Table, offers a similar nesting feature but at a higher price point. The Walker Edison set uses a tempered glass top, which looks sleek but is more prone to smudges and requires frequent cleaning.

Where the VASAGLE tables truly excel is in their balance of style, durability, and affordability. They may not have fancy features like hidden storage compartments, but their straightforward design makes them easy to incorporate into any room.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

For the features and quality you get, this coffee table set offers excellent value for money. It’s not the cheapest option out there, but it’s well worth the investment if you prioritize durability and design. Unlike cheaper alternatives, it doesn’t feel flimsy or look like it’s going to fall apart after a few months of use. While there are some minor drawbacks like the unattached tabletops, they’re not deal-breakers for me, especially considering the price point.

Features like the mix-and-match usage of the two tables (together or separately) add to the versatility. I’ve used one table in my bedroom as a nightstand and the other in the living room, and they look great in both settings. The size and portability make them ideal for renters or anyone who likes to change their home layout frequently.

This was all last night, and i still feel this way, can anyone tell me if this will go away on its own? i’m of course stopping my smoking for a while, if not forever if this continues to happen the next time i indulge. i know it can a long process to recovery if this is more serious than just a few days long, is there any tips for getting my mental state back in the real world?

left untouched in morning light.  
  
But sometimes, whispers in the walls  
will call to those who dare to stall.  
A fleeting cry, a plea, a sound—  
a thread that pulls, a heart unbound.  
  
What harm, you think, in just a glance?  
A peek, a step, a stolen chance.  
The mind is firm, the hand is sure,  
the threshold waits, the pull is pure.  
  
And in that space beyond the frame,  
the world is not, yet is the same.  
A shape too vast to comprehend,  
a thought that bends, a truth that rends.  
  
For one bright spark, it all makes sense—  
the perfect form, immense, intense.  
Then thought dissolves, the moment fades,  
and something breaks that can’t be saved.  
  
Some doors are locked for reasons sound.  
Some knowledge leaves you never found.  
And when the whisper calls once more,  
walk away—don’t touch the door.  
  
  
  
Vincent Madroon rubbed the sleep from his eyes, rolling over in bed. Lost in the ocean of pillows and blankets, he reached out blindly, searching. After a few seconds of floundering, his hand found Maria’s warmth. With a groggy smile, he murmured, “Coffee?”  

Maria, just as tired, only hummed in response, nuzzling deeper into the blankets. “Mmm. Maybe later.”  

Vincent chuckled softly, peeling himself from the bed.  

The halls of the Little Lamplight were decadent, an odd contrast to its unbelievably low rent. As he wandered through the corridors, he reminded himself again just how lucky he was to have found this place. The gold filigree, the intricate tapestries, the priceless artwork—it all looked like the kind of place that should cost a fortune. And yet, it was as cheap as a roadside motel.  

He never questioned why.  

**He never met the owner.**  

He used to joke with Maria that no one should tell her how absurdly low the prices were. She might realize her mistake.  

For two months,  the Little Lamplight had been a paradise—perhaps the only peace two magicless people could hope to find in a world ruled by the arcane. The rules were simple, and Vincent followed them religiously.  

Don’t visit the lake. It was the owner’s home. Some kind of water mage, from what he’d overheard.  

Don’t agitate the staff. The golems were docile, but no one wanted to see what happened if they weren’t.  

Don’t enter the staff quarters. Not just a rule—the rule.  

Breaking it was unthinkable. People warned him repeatedly: If you value your life, don’t open that door.  

And Vincent listened.  

Because this place was safe. Because Maria was safe.  

And then, one day, he heard a scream.  

It came from behind what he assumed was a maintenance closet door. High-pitched, agonized, desperate. Someone was in pain. **Someone needed help.**  

He ran to the door without thinking, hand gripping the knob.  

And then he froze.  

A sign. Plain, unassuming, hanging from the handle.  

STAFF ONLY.  

Vincent’s mind screamed at him. This is the rule. The most important rule. He had followed it without question for months. But could he really just stand here, listening to someone suffer?  

Then he thought of Maria.  

What would she think?  

The paralysis shattered.  

Vincent wrenched open the door—  

**—and his mind ended.**  

For one terrible, fleeting second, he saw it.  

A wretched, writhing mass. Tentacles, fins, glistening, shifting flesh. The entire ocean crushed into a shape that should not be. His brain, desperate for order, tried to comprehend it.  

And for that single moment, **he did.**  

It was **divine**. A shape beyond mortal understanding, a form of perfect design, sculpted by something greater than gods. He was weightless, breathless, in awe.  

And then, just as quickly, **he lost it.**  

His mind collapsed under the weight of what it had grasped. The understanding unraveled, slipping through his thoughts like water through cracked hands. The knowledge was gone forever, but the damage remained.  

**Vincent Madroon did not scream.**  
**Vincent Madroon did not move.**  

His body was still standing. His heart was still beating. **But Vincent Madroon was already dead. Maria was alone.**  

Samantha sighed.  

She bent down, shifting seamlessly back into her humanoid form, cradling his limp body in her hands. Her lips pressed into a thin line, disappointment flickering across her face.  

“Goddammit.”  

Her voice was quiet, more weary than angry.  

“I told them not to come in here.”  

She exhaled, closing Vincent’s lifeless eyes.  

“Someone clean this up. Put it with the rest.”  

The golem obeyed without question, lifting Vincent’s body as if he weighed nothing at all.  

Samantha lingered, watching, her face unreadable. Then she turned, stepping back into the corridors of Little Lamplight, her disguise seamlessly perfect once more.

I live in Virginia Beach, and have for 25 years ( five years was college and work up in the NOVA area). I got tired of living up in NoVA due to traffic, stress etc). 

All of my friends have moved away as they are either military, or tired of the area with nothing to do. It also doesn’t help that it is hard to find white collar jobs ( no offense to anyone that works blue collar, I would love to get out of corporate America if I could). Since I don’t drink, I don’t go to bars to socialize and it seems to be harder to find people around my age. 

People describe me as sort of a golden retriever, and I love going to antique stores and coffee shops. I just wish I could go with other people too. My girlfriend is incredibly supportive, but we don’t quite have the same interests in things like comic cons, videogames, (general somewhat nerdy stuff) and antique stores. I’d love to have other people to do that stuff with. 

Do you have any suggestions? Bumble BFF could be a suggestion, but even then, it is tricky to find people that aren’t going to be pulled away by the military. Thanks! ",3,1739390449.0,VirginiaBeach,2,1.0,False

It’s the kind of appliance that fits effortlessly into your daily coffee-making routine while also serving other purposes, like grinding spices and seeds. Let’s dive into the experience.

The design of this grinder is sleek and minimalist, with a black finish that blends well with my other kitchen gadgets. Its compact size makes it easy to store, though I usually leave it out since I use it so often. The stainless-steel blades and grinding cup feel durable, and the non-slip base is a thoughtful touch. While I appreciate its robust build, one downside is that the grinding cup isn’t removable, which can make transferring ground coffee or spices a bit tricky.

[Check DR MILLS DM-7441 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/dr-mills-dm-7441-review-with-b084q5xn6p-included/)

Its grinding performance impressed me from day one. Whether I’m grinding coffee beans for my morning brew or dried spices for a dinner recipe, the results are consistent. The one-touch operation allows for control over the coarseness or fineness. Pulsing the button for shorter periods creates coarser results, while holding it longer produces finer grains. I even used it to grind dried cayenne peppers into powder, and it did the job effortlessly.

Being a blade grinder, it’s not as precise as burr grinders, but it’s definitely more versatile. I’ve used it to grind nuts and seeds for baking, and it handled those tasks well. However, it’s worth noting that it’s not meant for wet ingredients, so stick to dry items only.

Operating the grinder is straightforward. The pulse button gives you complete control, and the transparent lid lets you see the grinding process. It even comes with a small brush for cleaning, which is a nice addition since water shouldn’t be used for cleaning the grinding cup. I usually wipe it down with a damp cloth and use the brush to remove any stubborn residues.

The capacity is modest, grinding up to 1.8 ounces (50 grams) at a time. This is enough for about seven cups of coffee. For larger batches, you’ll need to grind in multiple cycles. The motor is powerful but tends to heat up after prolonged use. Thankfully, there’s a thermal switch with overheating protection that automatically stops the grinder if it’s overused. This feature gives me peace of mind, though waiting for it to cool down can be a slight inconvenience.

**Pros**

* Compact and stylish design that complements any kitchen.
* Versatile grinding capabilities for coffee beans, spices, nuts, and seeds.
* Durable stainless-steel blades and non-slip base for better stability.
* Overheat protection ensures safety during use.
* Transparent lid allows for monitoring grind consistency.

**Cons**

* Grinding cup is not removable, making it slightly harder to clean.
* Limited capacity means it’s not suitable for large-scale grinding.
* Can overheat with prolonged operation, requiring cool-down time.
* Less precise than burr grinders for coffee enthusiasts.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to burr grinders, the DR MILLS DM-7441 offers less precision, especially for coffee enthusiasts who prefer specific grind sizes for brewing methods like espresso. However, its blade mechanism makes it far more versatile, handling a variety of dry ingredients like spices and seeds. Unlike manual grinders, this electric model is faster and more convenient but does produce some noise during operation. When stacked against competitors like the Cuisinart DCG-20BKN or the Hamilton Beach Fresh Grind, the DR MILLS DM-7441 holds its own with its robust build and overheat protection feature, though the lack of a removable grinding cup is a drawback.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This grinder sits comfortably in the middle range for electric blade grinders. Considering its versatility, durable build, and user-friendly design, it offers good value for money. While it doesn’t cater to the highly specific needs of coffee connoisseurs, it’s a great option for anyone looking for an all-purpose grinder.

From grinding coffee beans for my morning cup to pulverizing spices for dinner recipes, it’s been a reliable tool. It’s not perfect—cleaning could be easier, and the capacity might feel limiting for some—but for everyday use, it’s hard to complain at this price point.

With therapy, I've been reflecting on our previous relationship. Was this break-up in fact a blessing?","It’s my first time posting here and I would really appreciate everyone's input.



Jane (pseudonym) and I started dating in June 2023 after meeting on a dating app. About 5-6 dates in, she had a change of heart and wanted to break things off. I responded saying that I understood and wished her all the best. Surprisingly, within 24 hours, she reached out again to talk, and after meeting in person, she decided she wanted to give it another try (much time later, she would admit that she was “looking for a reason to stay”).

 

Fast forward to October 2023, when I asked her if she’d consider exclusivity. She declined and I accepted, and we continued to date as usual.

 

Come December 2023, she informs me that she bought a one-way ticket to Mexico for February 2024. Although I knew for a while that she had plans to go to Mexico to work remotely and escape our harsh winters (we’re in Canada), I still felt insecure about her leaving for a long time without us discussing what exactly we were. So, over breakfast one morning, I asked her what she was looking for and what she wanted from our relationship. I again suggest exclusivity, to which she responded, “What’s the difference between dating and exclusivity?” After some further talk, she agreed to being exclusive and got a little emotional from the conversation (she would later ‘joke’ to her friends and family by referring to this conversation was the “ultimatum”).

 

The relationship lasted a year (until December 2024), during which time the following happened (some highlights):

 

* I went to visit her in Mexico twice (she was gone for a month), during which time she got pregnant. I had to find her a pregnancy test because she couldn’t be bothered to purchase one and find out herself (in her words, “What’s the point of knowing now? We’re in Mexico. We can do anything about it.”). After returning home, she wanted to terminate the pregnancy, and I supported her the whole way through. Afterwards though she refused to talk about what happened.
* She was initially still friends with her ex-boyfriend (she still had a photo of the two of them on her fridge, which she took down when she noticed it bothered me). After telling her ex that she was seeing him, he started acting up (demanding more attention, etc.) and she was forced to end that friendship.
* On multiple occasions, she said to me things like, “Are our personalities compatible?”, or she would admit that she had doubts about us, only to take them back immediately afterwards.
* She was extremely emotional on her period (which she admitted) and would tell me that I had to put up with it every month (she once had a public emotional breakdown while on vacation because she couldn't find a restaurant that was open).
* She once grabbed coffee with a male friend who she once had a crush on (and slept with). She told me beforehand, but it wasn't her idea to tell me (one of her girlfriends told her that it might be appropriate to let me know).
* She grabbed lunch with a guy at work, assuming it was a recruitment or business lunch. That same guy asked her out for dinner, and she asked me how she should respond to his invitation (rather than just decline it).
* When we started dating, she wasn't in therapy, but decided to go back into it because she was impressed by how dedicated I was to my therapy journey. However, some time later, she told me that she spent every therapy session of hers talking about how different her and I were and asking her therapist at what point does she ""keep going"" with the relationship.



Now in all honesty, I had my flaws as well. I have anxiety, sometimes I'm grumpy, I can be overly sensitive, etc. But I'd like to think that I did the best with what I had. I do love her a lot, and when she ended things, I was a bit blindsided.

 

About 1.5 months after the break-up, I reached out for closure. During that conversation, she said that the reason why she broke up with me was because she was ""unsure of the relationship from the beginning, but that she ignored her concerns, hoping that they would go away on their own."" But after one year, her unsureness was still there, which made her pull the plug. She also divulged that she did love me at one point, but then later didn't anymore, hence why she ""stopped saying it or said it less frequently"".



I guess I'm just looking for some validation from this sub that this breakup is in fact a blessing in disguise for me. Please be kind and thank you so much.



**TL;DR:** My ex broke up with me 2 months ago after a 1.5 year relationship (1 year exclusive) and I need some feedback on whether this break up was in fact a blessing in disguise.",1,1739389903.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

With therapy, I've been reflecting on our previous relationship. Was this break-up in fact a blessing?","It’s my first time posting here and I would really appreciate everyone's input.

 

Jane (pseudonym) and I started dating in June 2023 after meeting on a dating app. About 5-6 dates in, she had a change of heart and wanted to break things off. I responded saying that I understood and wished her all the best. Surprisingly, within 24 hours, she reached out again to talk, and after meeting in person, she decided she wanted to give it another try (much time later, she would admit that she was “looking for a reason to stay”).

 

Fast forward to October 2023, when I asked her if she’d consider exclusivity. She declined and I accepted, and we continued to date as usual.

 

Come December 2023, she informs me that she bought a one-way ticket to Mexico for February 2024. Although I knew for a while that she had plans to go to Mexico to work remotely and escape our harsh winters (we’re in Canada), I still felt insecure about her leaving for a long time without us discussing what exactly we were. So, over breakfast one morning, I asked her what she was looking for and what she wanted from our relationship. I again suggest exclusivity, to which she responded, “What’s the difference between dating and exclusivity?” After some further talk, she agreed to being exclusive and got a little emotional from the conversation (she would later ‘joke’ to her friends and family by referring to this conversation was the “ultimatum”).

 

The relationship lasted a year (until December 2024), during which time the following happened (some highlights):

 

* I went to visit her in Mexico twice (she was gone for a month), during which time she got pregnant. I had to find her a pregnancy test because she couldn’t be bothered to purchase one and find out herself (in her words, “What’s the point of knowing now? We’re in Mexico. We can do anything about it.”). After returning home, she wanted to terminate the pregnancy, and I supported her the whole way through. Afterwards though she refused to talk about what happened.
* She was initially still friends with her ex-boyfriend (she still had a photo of the two of them on her fridge, which she took down when she noticed it bothered me). After telling her ex that she was seeing him, he started acting up (demanding more attention, etc.) and she was forced to end that friendship.
* On multiple occasions, she said to me things like, “Are our personalities compatible?”, or she would admit that she had doubts about us, only to take them back immediately afterwards.
* She was extremely emotional on her period (which she admitted) and would tell me that I had to put up with it every month (she once had a public emotional breakdown while on vacation because she couldn't find a restaurant that was open).
* She once grabbed coffee with a male friend who she once had a crush on (and slept with). She told me beforehand, but it wasn't her idea to tell me (one of her girlfriends told her that it might be appropriate to let me know).
* She grabbed lunch with a guy at work, assuming it was a recruitment or business lunch. That same guy asked her out for dinner, and she asked me how she should respond to his invitation (rather than just decline it).
* When we started dating, she wasn't in therapy, but decided to go back into it because she was impressed by how dedicated I was to my therapy journey (I've been in it for 10+ years). However, some time later, she told me that she spent every therapy session of hers talking about how different her and I were and asking her therapist at what point does she ""keep going"" with the relationship.



Now in all honesty, I had my flaws as well. I have anxiety, sometimes I'm grumpy, I can be overly sensitive, etc. But I'd like to think that I did the best with what I had. I do love her a lot, and when she ended things, I was a bit blindsided.

 

About 1.5 months after the break-up, I reached out for closure. During that conversation, she said that the reason why she broke up with me was because she was ""unsure of the relationship from the beginning, but that she ignored her concerns, hoping that they would go away on their own."" But after one year, her unsureness was still there, which made her pull the plug. She also divulged that she did love me at one point, but then later didn't anymore, hence why she ""stopped saying it or said it less frequently"".



I guess I'm just looking for some validation from this sub that this breakup is in fact a blessing in disguise for me. Please be kind and thank you so much.



**TL;DR:** My ex broke up with me 2 months ago after a 1.5 year relationship (1 year exclusive) and I need some feedback on whether this break up was in fact a blessing in disguise.",1,1739389845.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1inzt5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/1inzt5f/deadsimple_editing_tools_that_actually_work/,Dead-Simple Editing Tools That Actually Work,"Look, I'll be brutally honest: if you're searching for that magical editing secret, that 24-hour viral hack... don't read this post. You won't find it here.

Know what's worse than not having a YouTube channel?

Having one that's dead because you're stuck on editing.

Here's the truth: we've all been there. That moment when you don't know if posting that video would stick or go down the drain as the rest where you spent a lot of time editing. But something changed everything for me: You don't need to be an editing wizard to start. For real.

What you need is to make videos people actually want to watch. That simple.

What makes people watch? Clear flow. Getting to the point. Respecting their time. Always ask yourself: 'Would I watch this? Would I click on this thumbnail?' That's your guide, everything else comes after.

Everything else? Just fancy extras.

Let's get to what matters: tools you can use TODAY.

Starting out? You need simple:

Canva Video Editor is basically PowerPoint for videos. If you've ever put together a presentation, you've got this. Drag, drop, done.

CapCut is your pocket ace. Free, mobile-first, surprisingly capable. Best part? Edit while waiting for your coffee (pro tip: you can install the older versions if you have android to bypass the paywalls).

Ready for the big leagues? Alright.

DaVinci Resolve is where things get serious. We're talking Hollywood-level stuff here - the same tool used in films like Avatar and The Batman. Yeah, that level. The insane part? The free version is more powerful than most paid editors. The catch? Steeper learning curve, but trust me, it's worth it.

Need voiceovers that don't sound like robots? Here's your secret weapon: DupDub turns your text into natural-sounding voices in 70+ languages. For tutorials or explanations? Total game-changer.  
  
And while we're sharing secrets, here are three more tools that might save your life:  
\- OBS Studio: For crystal-clear screen recording, no watermarks   
\- Handbrake: When your videos are too heavy but you can't lose quality   
\- Descript: For those who hate traditional editing - edit your video like it's a Word doc

But here's what really matters:

Your tool matters less than what you do with it.

I've seen phone-edited CapCut videos hit millions. And pro-software videos with zero views.

The difference? Content. Story. Message.

Don't freeze up searching for the perfect tool. It doesn't exist.

Pick one. Any one. Start.

Your first video will suck. Your second one too. But by number ten? That'll be a different story.

You've two choices now: Keep reading about editing. Or open one of these and start.

That's your call.

Which one are you picking? Don't say ""soon."" Don't say ""when I have time."" Tell me which one. Now.

Because the only editing that doesn't work is the editing you never start.

P.S. If you're waiting for the perfect moment, this is it.",3,1739389513.0,NewTubers,0,1.0,False

/3/2123: The friendship spacecraft is launched into deep space. Its mission is to find signs of sentient life in the cosmos. The AI powering the craft was an outdated logic based engine. Although it was underpowered compared to more modern Intelligent AIs, it was chosen for its robust, though flawed, nature. The programs loaded onto it allowed it to self replicate and improve its programming, ensuring a long mission even if it was damaged. 

	4/3/2323: Today is the 200th anniversary of the launch of the friendship spacecraft. Thanks to it, humanity had discovered multiple friendly civilizations and a few predatory. Though thanks to their new allies in Dwager Kingdom, Holy Elf Empire, The Vixen Trade Federation +, and The Nekotan Republic, humanity was able to get a foothold in the space age. This allowed humanity to throw away their shackles of the old world and be rebuilt as the United Sol Empire. My name is Nicole, I am that empires second princess. Thanks to my position, I was given combat training and placed into the 1sr platoon of the Sol Defense Force (SDF) marine core. Over time, I rose in ranks until I became the captain of a small special ops team, codenamed, ""The Royal Ace"".

	8/15/2323: My brother, who is in the SDF naval fleet Baffle 3, has been sent to Neptune. His fleet was activated to investigate the mysterious loss of communications with the Neptune welcoming station. It's a station set up to welcome foreigners into the Sol system. Communication was lost after a transmission was received informing Sol command of an unknown civilization approaching.

	9/20/2323: It has now been 1 month since contact was lost with Baffle 3. An unmanned SDF Guardian probe satellite reported 100% casualties for Baffle 3 before its antenna was disabled. The last images it sent were of ships no one had ever seen before. My mother is sending them to the other empires we have friendly relationships with to find out if any of them know what it is.

	12/23/2323: Neptune and Uranus have fallen, The war against this unkown civilization is still ongoing, currently above the skies of Saturn. The Vixens got back to mom and said they look similar to a civbilizagtion known as the leviathins. They would invade planets, enslaving the strong to take back as entertainment, slaying the rest along with their planet. However, this is impossible as according to their legends, the Hero Kyren, utilizing the power of their war goddess Serena, lead the Vixens on a war path slaying the Leviathins

	2/24/2324: My mother has called for me today. She is pulling me away from my squad, I studied robotics in college, so she wanbts me to help with a new project to fight these aliens with, the projectr is Codenamed Alpha. We are gonna take an experimental sentinel chassis and put an alphas body over it. It will have the combat specs of a sentinel with the nuclear reactor of an alpha unit. The AI will be powered by soul gtechnology developed by Awesome Robotics of the Nekotans. She was able to procure it because she was originally a senator of the Nekotan Repuvblic. We both look like cat girls because of this. 

	6/12/2324: The Alpha Project is complete. I am currently waiting for my mother and sister to bring the volunteer. My mother said they are an accomplished captain of a special forces group. I am excited to meet such a person to thank them for their sacrifice. They will have their soul removed using a soul capture, I've been told the process is painless. Once it is complete, the unit will have a limiteer installed asllowing the AI to access the souls' memories of combat experience and training without the soul driving the AI. I'm excited for today. 

	I stepped back from my computer, satisfied with my diary up to this point. My sister told me to write it, it helps with stress. It'll also leave a record of me for future generations. I have installed a copy of it in the Alpha unit for funsies. 

Now she was supposed to be here 20 minutes ago,"" I said to myself. I decided to get myself a cup of coffee while I waited. While I was in the kitchen, I heard the door to the lab open up. I went to investigate and found mom standing there alone. ""Mom, what happened to the volunteer I asked?"" 

""There were some... complications,"" she replied, ""They should be here soon."" She came closer to me to give me a hug. That was when it happened. While she was embracing me, I felt something stab my shoulder. I looked over to see what it was, and to my horror, I saw the soul capture in my arm. ""Mom! Why?"" was all I could ask. ""You'll understand one day,"" she replied, ""Just remember that I'll always love you no matter what you are."" I began to feel my consciousness fading. The last thing I remember seeing was my mom standing over me fighting with my maidtronic 20 gen C01ette. Then it all faded to black.

Fascism—in increasing possibility he’d be sleeping in the foyer with his rifle and would go down fighting if they ever came for me. He’s libertarian and peace loving but he also has the ability to throw down and fuck someone up if he has to

My oldest is from a high school relationship, and her birth mother isn't in her life at all. My wife adores my oldest daughter and my daughter adores her as well, they get along very well. We have a 4 month old as well. My wife stopped working 6 months into her pregnancy, and we are very fortunate that I was able to quickly find a part-time job working for my boss on the side to make up for her income. This arrangement has worked pretty well so far, I am able to do the part-time job from home and occasionally during my normal work hours if I have downtime. I write medical reports so it's something I can stop doing and come back to pretty easily, which allows me some flexibility, but often I am working a full day at the office and I still have 2-3 hours of work to do in the evening. I mostly do this side work after the kids have gone to bed, so usually like 9:30 to midnight or so. 

She's staying at home with the baby full time, which I completely understand is a full time job, and she does it really well. During the day she's watching baby and doing laundry, and tidying up the house if she feels like it. I place zero pressure on her to keep the house clean or make dinner, as I fully understand that sometimes the baby requires all of her focus during the day, and her energy levels will rise and fall accordingly.

Every day I drop our oldest off at school, and my wife picks her up from the car line. When I get home from work, I sometimes sit in my office for 30 minutes or so, reading reddit or playing a point and click game to decompress. Other times I go straight to take the baby from her so she can do her own thing. This past weekend I jokingly forced her to leave the kids with me and go out shopping and get herself a coffee and have some time for herself, which went well and she enjoyed. We both go grocery shopping together, we both attend all of the baby's appointments, and we make time for ourselves and go out to brunch at least once per week, sometimes more. I keep track of the weekly and monthly bills, our finances, our cars, and anything to do with yardwork or repairs around the home (admittedly less during the winter months).  I clean the dishes every day or two, and am responsible for the kitchen, and we have our older daughter helping with a daily chore list as well.

The biggest point of friction right now is that she feels my life hasn't changed much compared to hers, and she's right about that. Her life now revolves around being a SAHM, and I think she may be feeling a bit burnt out with the sheer constant responsibility of it all. I think if my wife was fully honest with what she wants, she would tell me that as soon as I get home from work I should take the baby for at least a couple of hours and let her have some freedom. Conceptually, I am fine with that, but in reality I am also tired most days and sitting in my office to decompress after work is a needed ritual for me, even if I only get 30 minutes. I am also studying math and science with hopes to go back to school in the near future, but that happens sporadically enough that it doesn't really affect our routines.

In my own opinion, I feel that the duties are fairly divided, with me being the breadwinner, and her being the homemaker. I know what mental load is and I feel that I contribute my fair share of it. I also know this is a somewhat outdated concept, but it works in my opinion. The advice I'm needing is, am I doing enough at home to help my wife with the baby?

This just isn't sustainable and overall makes for poorly administered services. This only cheapens the value of the Aggie experience and merits a revision of tuition and everything. Why are we okay with this?

I know this is a longer read, so I apologize but I would really appreciate if anyone reads through this and can give any insight/opinions especially if you're a Taurus girl yourself! <3

I'm a Scorpio female, she's a Taurus, and we've gotten to know each other through university. We had a class together in 2023 when I first noticed her but never had a reason to talk. I obviously thought she was very pretty and the calm/kind energy she radiated caught my attention too. I'd constantly catch her staring at me in class. We barely interacted but were were sometimes surrounded by the same people we both knew.

Fast forward to Fall 2024 term, we had a lab class together and were in the same group with three other girls. The class was interactive, so it gave us a chance to get to know each other better. We had two other classes together, also with our three other lab partners, but they were lectures so we couldn't talk much, but we still did. Also, she has a gf but I didn't know that until probably a month into the term.

It started when our professor graded homework and emailed the class saying if you didn't get a grade, it may because you got flagged for AI. We both didn't, and she was anxious all lab. After class, I texted her asking if she's okay since she seemed nervous. I reassured her that our teacher is understanding and not to worry. She said I'm so sweet and asked how I'm feeling too. Before this interaction, we had small ones like me opening the door for her and her saying thank you so much sweetie. She also touched my arm a few times in lab while talking to me. The eye contact was also there, and I felt like when we talked, our energy or tension was different than how it felt with other girls in our lab group. Idk how to describe it.

Eventually she adds me on snapchat and I snap her. This was around midterms, and I think I sent her a pic that says I'm so cooked. She replied offering to study with her at school, but I politely declined (keeping it mysterious). She said if I changed my mind the offer is still there. Throughout the term, there'd be times I'd catch her looking at me. Like when our teacher asked us to partner up with someone to discuss a topic, I caught her looking at me twice, then looked away when I saw her.

Throughout the term we'd talk on snap more, but it was always me initiating it. We'd send pictures, which slowly turned into sometimes sending mini vlogs and talking that way. I tried to be more friendly so for example, there was a point where the weather was so bad so I snapped her saying be careful since the conditions sucked and she's a further drive to school. She again called me sweet and we started talking about other things. I offered her my notes from a course I've taken and that she was currently in. When i did this, she called me sweet thang (lol) and said I'm a sweet angel. She said she owes me, I replied saying you don't owe me anything ever, then she sent a pic of her blowing a kiss and drew hearts all around. Next day in class, she walks behind my chair and puts her hand on my back as she walked by. When I glanced up, she turned back and smiled.

A week later on my birthday she said “HAPPY BIRTHDAY 😻🤍🫶🏼🤪😘🫣🥳”. She also said happy birthday in class and put her hand on my arm when saying it. Next day in class she put her hand on my arm again asking what I did. I'm thinking at this point, she thinks I'm sweet, I've caught her looking at me, she's making small physical touch. When we spoke in person, it just felt like there was underlying attraction there.

She once said how she grew up in a small town with a lot of closed minded people, didn't grow up around gay people, POC, etc. Since we were walking to our cars with other people, I didn't ask much but afterwards I messaged her asking how that was for her growing up, being gay in a small community where people wouldn't accept you. I told her if that was too personal that she wouldn't have to share but she was receptive and told me about her background/time growing up. Other interactions was her offering me to stay at her house when I told her I was annoyed that a family member was gonna stay with us for a few months. Walked by me in class while we were both standing and put her hand on my mid back. There was a time I noticed her at school during her 4hr gap between classes. Since I lived close, I went home until I had to come back for lab so I asked her if she wanted me to bring her anything. She again called me sweet, thanked me.

She followed me first on instagram at this time. I also know she has a gf at this point. We snapped more, our videos became more frequent and responses were quick. We had many positive interactions beyond this point.

Towards the end of the term, like end of November, she didn't open my snap for like 4 days, and then when I left her on delivered for like ten hours before responding, she replied immediately and continued replying within literally seconds of me sending something. I even sent just pics cause maybe she thought the amount of videos we sent were overwhelming, but she'd reply with videos.

Fast forward to start of December, exam season. We planned to study for our exam together once I finished an exam for another class. Before I went to her, I got two flavors of vitamin water, one for her and me. I told her I brought her one but didn't know which flavor she liked so I got orange for her immune system since she was sick, and another in case she didn't like orange. She called me sweet like five times. We started studying, our friend joined us. After some time, me and her were over it while our other friend was locked in. We started talking lots, had sarcastic banter, I made her laugh and the overall vibe was playful. There was even a window that led to the roof that we debated going on. She ended up doing it and got stuck so I had to pull her up. We were just being goofy. We also talked about how I might be moving in 2025 to another province, she said she was thinking of moving there too for her masters.

On another day we planned to study, she texted me in the morning asking if I wanted anything from a coffee shop. I said no but thank you so much and she replied okayyyy<3. Later we snapped more and she called me pookie. On a completely different day where we didn't plan to study, she texted only me from our lab group asking if I was studying at school. I said yes and asked if she wants me to bring her anything she said you're so sweet and too kind to me. I said let me know if anything changes and she said thanks bb.

We finished our final exam and afterwards I snapped her saying I lowkey feel bummed classes are ending since I feel like there wasn't enough time for us to get to know each other more, especially if i move. She said she never thinks of that and is usually just hyped another term ended. She also said she thought to herself ""is this the last time I'm going to see her"". She also said on the same video ""I know for your sake you have to move but for my sake I don't want you to"". I felt like this was a pretty intense thing to say considering she has a gf, and it just further made me think maybe she is interested.

After this interaction, she started taking longer to reply, it was around the holidays when she visited back home with her gf. It was like a week that she left me on delivered until she replied and apologized. We kinda had phases since then where she'd reply, we'd send videos, and then she'd leave me on delivered for a while again, like a week, a few times a bit longer.

We started the new term in January 2025 and when she finally did reply to one of my snaps, we started talking about classes. She said she'd see me later in one cause she thinks I'm in it (I wasn't, we don't even have any classes this term). I replied saying we don't but if she ever wants to hang to let me know. I jokingly added I wouldn't ask first out of fear because she told me once that she likes to go home after work/school to shower and see her gf. She replied asking me to send my schedule, said we can plan to hang and that she only said she goes home because she never has anything to do. She said if she had plans, she'd of course stay. She said she'd love to hang and that she's scared to ask to hang so if I text her, she'll text me. I told her it's intimidating for me since she has a gf, her set group of friends, and busy with work/school. She said ""don't be scared, please ask me, if I ever say no it's not because I don't want to because I do. Sometimes I don't have a lot of time but i do want to.""

Fast forward to end of January and the last time we talked, she said that she slept with an open mouth so her throat hurt. I playfully replied saying she did sound sick but on the plus, a raspy voice is hot on anyone. I also talked about some other things that were in response to what she said. When she replied, it seemed low energy and she said something like sorry there was a lot in that. Since then, she's left my snap on delivered. It's been 3 weeks and it sucks because I genuinely like her. I know she has a gf, I wouldn't cross boundaries, but I selfishly wish she'd talk to me. I swear I felt something from her end too, but this radio silence now makes me confused.

Idk if she was only being nice to me throughout this entire time, or if she felt the same attraction/connection that I did and didn't know how to feel internally because she has a gf so she pulled back. Maybe her gf thinks we've talked too much and asked her to stop talking to me, maybe she felt like replying to so many videos became a chore (but she could've easily just started replying with pics, I would've matched her energy). I really don't know..

I can't help but feel like if she didn't want anything to do with me, or felt no attraction, there wouldn't be so many signs that would lead me to believe she did feel something. I also don't think my gut would be so sure that I felt that between us.

Based on her zodiac and what I've shared, do you think her interactions were something more than platonic? What do you think could've been the reason she went ghost? Do you think I shouldn't message her? I haven't since she's left me on read cause I'm so embarrassed, but I really do miss our chats.",0,1739388857.0,Taurusgang,2,0.5,False

Was wondering if anyone would be interested sometime in the future to chat with my brother who has high functioning Aspergers. 

He’s a sweet/kind guy, early 30’s with a bit of a stutter but very knowledgeable, loves talking about world war 2, ancient history, gaming/ the gaming industry, art and tea.

He’s been a bit a loner lately and I’m just looking for anyone who loves to chat about any of these topics at a coffee/tea place or take a day trip somewhere like the ROM or hang at the board game cafe.

I’ve introduced him to the meetup app but he’s nervous and hesitant to start using it so I thought this would be a more casual less pressure way to meet some new people with similar interest.

1inzf8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1inzf8j/a_story_of_child_abuse/,A story of child abuse,"As a child you are very vulnerable to situations that happen to you, it is the responsibility of caregivers to give children the attention and care they need. But this isn’t always the case, sometimes a parent or parents will abuse the power that they have to  abuse and neglect a child and unfortunately this is something that happens more often then most people realize. The story that I’m about to tell is at times traumatic and the pain still lingers but this is my story.     

I was born in a small town in central Indiana May 1997 to my mother 20 and father 26, I was there 2nd child i had an older brother . Around this time my dad was in the army but not long after he joined the navy he had a track record of resisting arrest and dealing drugs present even before I was born. The illegal activities he engaged in  were consistent even now . When I was a year and a half we lived in a trailer outside of town of corse it was filthy and the room my brother and I shared was littered with dog poop and soaked in pee . My father would deal drugs out of the trailer and one of the men who would stop by was a man named Brock who was a close friend of my dads and there was another man but his name is lost to my memory. At times the 3 of them would play cards and drink together well one night they were playing around with a gun  it’s unclear who shot and why it happened but Brock was shot and died . Both my father and the unnamed man where not charged for any wrongdoing in Brock’s death and life went on like it never happened.  

Skip forward I was two years old and we still lived in the trailer and of corse my dad was dealing a large amount of weed and pills. One day I was playing with my toys and I knocked over a bag he had on the coffee table spilling a half pound of weed along with a fine powder, this is the first time I remember being physically abused he punched me in the stomach and slapped me around until I peed myself and my nose was bleeding i remember crying for my mom to save me she was at work. 

For a time my uncle stayed with us , he slept with knives in his bed and for some reason when he moved out we were given the same bed to sleep in. He forgot one of his knives and while I was sleeping i rolled onto it and it stabbed me in my lower back leaving a very nasty scar that sometimes still aches.

My father was sent to navy basic training at the academy in the Great Lakes all the while we moved out of the trailer and temporarily into my grandmothers house . She was a sweet lady sometimes stubborn but genuinely cared about us. Time passed and my father finnished basic training and we were sent to meridian Mississippi l. He developed a bad drinking habit and a love for wwe while in Mississippi. The base commander was part of a notorious racist group and my dad being himself made friends with them and would invite them over for fires and cookouts while they where dressed in what resembled to me at the time ghost costumes. 

In 2001 we moved to San Diego California while we lived here he breed pitbulls and sold them on the side for extra money , some of his customers where involved in dog fighting rings but he sold to them regardless for extra money. Not long after moving to California we were sent inland to a small town near Fresno. We lived in a circle neighborhood surrounded by several homes with other kids. My dad would host party’s where alcohol was available to these same kids some where as young as 6. I am uncertain why we moved to a town less than 10 miles away but i believe it was something to do with one of our pitbulls killing a neighbors dog and him trying to cover it up as a hit and run gone wrong. 

The new house we moved was actually closer to the school I went to  but there were fewer kids. Across the street there was a highly religious couple with 2 kids that would watch us after school they where a bit odd and would sometimes speak in tongues or run outside naked drunk but that was relatively tame compared to things happening at home. Around this time my dads drinking problem got extremely bad he would make me and my older brother fight for his entertainment and sometimes if he thought we weren’t hitting hard enough he would join in and beat us up these fights would happen when wwe wasn’t on . A common occurrence when he would drink would be him thinking someone stole his beer so he would chase us down and beat us up. 

Something that haunts me to this day happened one summer night my father was drinking ,he told us to dig a hole and it ended up being big enough for both me and my brother to fit in but it wasn’t ment for us . The hole was ment for our dog my dad made us lay this healthy dog down in the  and made us watch him execute one of our family pets. The smell the twitching the sounds all of it is burned into my memory I feel sorrow for this poor baby. 

On another one of his drunken episodes he had us invite our friends over for a sleepover and convinced us to skinny dip with him the oldest was a 14 year old boy . I believe he was watching us for some sort of gratification , our friends had a troubled home with parents addicted to substances I’m sure this played a factor in how bold he was. 

Months later he was drinking yet again , he was arguing with my mom he hit her she hit him then he grabbed his gun and chased he with it, i feared for my moms life so i did the only thing a 7 year old can do i called the police and told them what was happening they told me to stay on the line but i was afraid that if i was caught on the phone with them i would be next so i hung up and hide until it was over. He never shot her but the gun was loaded safety was off and he did have it pointed at her I believe if I didn’t call the police he would have killed us maybe not that night but some time not long after. The police showed up arrested him and questioned us and I told them everything. I’m not sure why but my mom bonded him out maybe because of fear but he grilled me for what I told the police for the upcoming court case but I told him nothing so he beat me violently demanding what I told them . I went to school the next day and cops was going to take me my brother and my younger sisters who where babies at the time . The religious neighbor across the street worked for cps and tipped my mom off so she fled the state with us just hours before cops would arrive . In doing so she retained us kids and fled the state where she was the primary witness in an attempted murder case . Because she fled he got a lesser charge and was given a year of probation a few sort months later. 
 
We fled to Indiana where most of our family lived and where taken in to live with my grandmother again, life seemed better and our grandmother showed us love that we had to that point not experienced  it was surreal. We were able to experience a short childhood while we lived with her but good things don’t last forever. The very next year right before my 9th birthday the Parole office allowed my dad to transfer to Indiana .

When he transferred back he was in the process of being discharged for the military not honorable or dishonorable but was still able to use his military status to take out lones for a 2 story 4 bedroom home and 3 apartment buildings, his plan was to rent them out for cash to pay for legal fees and make a passive income only issue was all 3 apartments where in bad shape and needed new shingles/ drywall. Before we started work restoring the apartment while on probation he was high / drunk/ and took pills ,climbed up a tree 30 to grab a raccoon that was perched on a limb . This didn’t end well the chain lock he was using wasn’t ment for climbing so he fell 30 feet breaking his hip a a rib  and broke his arm in 2 places. He nearly died from the fall but even this didn’t change his corse.immediately after his accident he forced my brother who was 11 and myself who was 9 to work on his apartment buildings and when we failed to work like grown men in his words he beat us with a Cain. He ended up hiring people he was selling weed and pills to  for the job and they did a shorty job Which he blamed us for since we weren’t good enough. He even treated one of the men he sold drugs to like a son and would have him punch us for a quick laugh.

Although a lot of work was done and the apartment where still in bad shape he started renting them out to drug addicts and people that where desperate as to take advantage of them , he would sometimes make people pay rent twice a month threatening violence if they didn’t compile. One of the worst things he ever did happened one day in summer I was 10 and my younger sisters where 4,2 and my brother was 12. Our 4 year old sister spilt a whole bottle of shampoo on the carpet he found out first and all he saw was red , he started punching my brother violently I tryed to stop him and he replied your next so I ran to my room ,he followed kicked the door in and proceeded to beat me up until I peed myself then said to me did you just piss yourself!!! Which must have made him angrier because he started punching me harder all I thought at that moment was I’m going to die. But he stoped after he threw me into the wall and called me worthless. He then demanded we pack are bags and planed to drop us off at foster care but it’s was a bluff. He did drop my 4 year old sister off on the highway for 15 minutes alone and I can’t forgive him for that.

Due to us not having a stable income the bank foreclosed on our house and we had a sub pump issue that flooded the basement, he wanted my brother and me to go down there and grab all the stuff out  there was 22 inches of water and it was just a inch drum the wall plugin so we didn’t have much time where it would be safe . He wanted 200 boxes moved out of a flooded basement in 2 hours we failed  by only getting 137 so he smacked us around and forced us to grab the rest while he watched threatening when he thought we where going to slow. We eventually got everything but were punished with nothing to eat for dinner.

We moved into one of the apartments in better shape we would occasionally be hit or smacked around but it was a bit more rare at least until we moved to a small town on the edge of the county where we had a wood burning stove and had 8 pitbulls that would use the restroom inside making it smell awful . We were forced to cut wood and keep the fire going he didn’t want to lift a finger we would cook, clean, and take care of our siblings all while he would wright books that he thought would make him rich. If the fire went out he would wake us up beat us and Make us cut firewood at 3 am on school nights. He started flirting with one of the girls he was selling weed to he was 38 and she was 15 it was very uncomfortable they told each other they loved one another and soon he kicked my mom out of the house and would send her death threats if she ever tryed to get custody of us . The mother of the 15 year old girl as well as my mother put restraining orders on him but he broke them daily to harass and threaten my mom and to see and kiss the underage girl. He definitely had sexual relations with this girl before she was 16 and even after they constantly had a sexual relationship all while the restraining order was in effect. When she turned 17 he got her pregnant and right before she gave birth he was able to marry her effectively grooming her . 

While this under age girl was pregnant we moved into my grandmas house they then developed a spice addiction and drained her life savings we were helpless and unable to stop him or he would threaten to kill is. The baby was born but had a possative thc test and the spice addiction gave him a learning disability. About a year later they kicked there spice addiction and started saving to move out of my grandmas home, there was a town named freedom indiana where we ended up moving to . My dad lost all his apartment due to foreclosure right before he divorced my mom but was able to rent to own a modular on 10 acres of land , his plan this time to make money was to start a farm  and have me take care of it for him . My brother stayed with my grandma and was of age at this point and I was 16 so now I had to take care of my younger siblings and 100 animals. He purchased 16 goats 50 chickens 25 ducks 4 pings 4 turkeys 3 lambs and we owned 6 dogs . He would buy 150 lbs of break and expect that to be enough for all these animals to eat for 2 months. My only gift for my birthday was a axe to build a fence with for a 10 acre plot of land . My heart still sinks being forced to choose what animals would live or die and being blamed for his actions. Whenever an animal would die he would blame me when he wouldn’t listen to my pleads for grains and feed for the animals. One of our dogs was so hungry it attacked a lamb breaking the lambs leg . I was blamed for this and was forced to watch my dad shoot the lamb in the head  and was told to throw the animal in the woods. While in freedom he started drinking again and nearly shot me in the head one night when the barn light went out  and he sent me out to fix it. Food was scarce and I lost 20 pounds I knew that if it kept up like this we would starve my siblings and myself hadn’t eaten for nearly a week while my dad and his wife would eat fast food as to not have leftovers for us. I went outside in the middle of winter with my axe and killed 3 chickens to eat . To take the like of an animal is to lose a pice of oneself but I couldn’t watch my siblings starve and I could feel myself growing weak for hunger. My explanation to him was the chickens froze to death which wasn’t much different then what had been happening we had already lost 8 to the cold and I would be blamed regardless. He never put a once of effort into the farm he desperately wanted he just wanted his children to do the work for him without food for themselves or the animals.

He failed to pay on the modular and we were evicted and soon moved  right outside greencastle Indiana where we were on roughly 4 acres of land . He demanded I build a fence in less than a mouth with just my axe and trees. I was able to do it but the skin on my hands would peel off exposing the unripe skin underneath, blood would drip from the hilt of my axe and I would feel every swing each being worse than the last . I dug post holes and soon the fence was finnished but the work was rushed and shoty. The land was more fertile so the animals were able to eat and give birth to healthy offspring unlike the previous address where we had a dozen still birth goats. I would soon find a way to move in with my grandmother he was regaining to fear I might be able to overpower him at the age of 17 so he forced me to live with my grandmother. 

Although my grandmothers house was ravaged and would soon be condemned due to the damage my dad did to her house the peace I felt living with her was like nothing I experienced up until this point. She treated me differently to my brother and seemed to favor him but to me I didn’t care I was starved for affection and didn’t know what it felt like to be loved I didn’t mind being lesser. The summers were moderate because we hade a working ac but in the winter the house would get as low as 20 degrees. The cold was a minor issue and was easy to get past. In the spring I had a strangulated hernia that nearly took my life I was told that if I waited just 4 hours longer to go to the hospital I would have died . The recovery from my surgery was long no one stayed with me while I was in the hospital I was all alone for 2 weeks. When I was able to leave my dad picked me up and had me for 3 days and in that time I was forced to babysit and feed and water his animals when the doctor told me to be in bed rest. I was finally able to go back to my grandmothers house but to my shock  a week later my dog that my dad still had at his house died from him starving him to death . I think he did this to spite me for not constantly coming over to take care of his farm  but I buried my pup. 

The recovery from my surgery took a year and still I needed a follow up to Finnish the repair. In the summer of 2016 we moved to an apartment and my grandmothers house was condemned . Our new home was in town where finding a job would be easier , both me and my brother found work to pay the bills and around this time my dad kicked my sisters out so we took them in to raise them. A few years later my grandmother died and I cut my dad off . I haven’t talked to him since 2020 .


If you made it this far thank you so much for reading my story I hope that if you have similar issues in your own life knowing you are not alone will help you stay strong , you can survive.

The sensation tickling itself through Professor Mikhail T River's mind felt simultaneously unrecognizable yet deeply familiar. It wasn't just sobriety. Though rare, that was something the usually stoned man experienced from time to time. Regardless of his use of cannabis as a medicine to treat his ADHD, he could go without and still feel relatively normal. This particular feeling twisting through his neurons was much more reminiscent of something he felt when he was still a young adult going to drug-fueled parties. In the simplest of terms, he wanted more. Even if he couldn't really put his finger on what his brain wanted from him, it didn't matter. Until this mission is completely over, he has a job to do. And with only the final sweep and clear left to perform, Mik tried to keep his mind occupied by chatting with the rest of the mech operators through the open comms.

“So, wait, does that mean your cybernetics allow you to slow down time, Mik?”

“I mean…” Being inside of a virtual environment that created a nearly perfect rending of the outside world, Mik couldn't see Nashka's face as she asked that question. However, he could tell by the way her mech was looking at his and the tone of her voice that she was intrigued. “Kinda but really. Like, I can't literally see time slow down ‘r nothin’. But… Well… It's almost like I know somethin’s happenin’ an’ can react before I actually know what's goin’ on. It's fuckin’ weird if I'm bein’ honest with yah.”

“Huh… You know… I don't think you'd make a very good salesman, Mik.”

“I'll take that as a compliment, Nashka!” The Martian professor’s retort came with a dismissive chuckle.

While he didn't really mind talking about his neuro-sync, especially from the people who had just seen what it was capable of, he was having a bit of difficulty focusing on his mostly melted surroundings while giving coherent answers to complicated questions. At the moment, he and the twenty other mech operators were casually escorting a small company of heavily armored Nishnabe Militia ground troops through the smoldering remains of the Chigagorian colony. That alone was enough to keep his mind busy. Between the small fires that still burned, the oozing piles of slag that were recognized structures less than an hour ago, and the vaguely crab-shaped blast shadows, there were no obvious signs of life anywhere. In fact, all scan data indicated that nothing, not even micro organisms, had survived the orbital bombardment. However, he didn't want to get complacent in the home stretch and potentially lose someone.

“Well, I still want one!” Despite being one the best BD operators in serving in the Nishnabe Militia, the rainbow-eyed young warrior woman was able to muster up the brattiest inflection Mik had ever heard. “I can't have some young warrior showing me up just because they have a mod that I don't!”

“I believe Mikhail is older than you are, Menashka.” Sub-Admiral Marzima cut in with a snide chuckle in Mik's defense but still had the poise to give the young Nishnabe warrior an easy out. “Or were you referring to the rank in your people's militia?”

“Yeah, I meant the rank. I know this guy’s an old man like Tens.” Nashka laughed as she unconsciously caused her mech's hand to make a mocking gesture towards Mik's machine. “But seriously though, I already have cybernetic modifications. Getting a few more isn't a big deal to me.”

“An’ what happens if we find out usin’ a neuro-sync with a BD ain't a good idea?” Though Mik's voice didn't become a bit more serious, he mimicked the young woman's rude gesture in a playful manner. “I mean, that's why I'm ‘ere with y’all. We gotta do some studies before we start mixin’ technologies. Better me fuckin’ up my brain than anybody else.”

“Hold on, Mikhail.” The clear notes of concern in Marz’s voice caused Mik to instinctively turn his mech towards the Qui'ztar's. “Are you saying you have no idea how your neuro-sync would interact with a BD and its control systems? And that you're using yourself as a test subject?!?”

“This ain't the first time I've been a guinea pig, an’ it hopefully ain't gonna be the last.” While Martian's voice had instantly snapped back to its more playful norm, that did little to set Marz and a few of the Nishnabe warriors’ minds at ease. “An’ like I said, better me than someone else. Wouldn't wanna let little rainbow ‘ere hurt ‘erself now.”

“Yeah, she hurts herself enough as it is!” One of the Nishnabe warriors piloting a standard issue BD-9 at the far side of the group blurted out, triggering a chorus of laughter.

“Shut up, weenuk! And don't call me that, Mikhail! Or should I say, little Micky?” As scathing as Nashka thought her response was, especially with the back up of a few ‘ooo's from her fellow Nishnabe mech pilots, both Mik and Tens suddenly burst out laughing. “But seriously though, Mik. If one of your people's brain computers can help me operate a BD the way you did without any real experience, then I want one. And I'm sure a few of the other warriors do too.”

“Give me two of them!” A different Nishnabe warrior half-jokingly chimed in, spurring some chuckling and some mutters of agreement.

“No technology will ever make up for a lack of training, young warriors.” Tens's sing-songy accent became a bit more strong and stoic as he impart his wisdom. “Mik's logged something like three-hundred hours of sim time in the past few months. His brain computer may have helped, but it still took motivation and dedication. That's what you all need to become great warriors.”

“Wow, Tens, you almost sound like Gad.” Even with her face covered by her mech's control interface helm and hidden inside of a heavily armored war machine, everyone listening to open comms knew Nashka rolled her eyes. “Anyways… I'm getting one of those neuro-syncs soon or later. Assuming you don't end up brain dead before then, Mik.”

“Shit, I'm already brain dead!”

As the banter continued, so did the mission. With twenty-one mechanized combat walkers, a hundred ground troops clad in heavy, powered exo-armor, and the entire area burnt to a crisp, the actual threat profile was fairly low. The only real danger came from the still steaming ground and small fires that were releasing toxic fumes. Any Chigagorian left alive after the orbital bombardment would require a mercy killing, not an execution. The devastation was total and complete. The closest tree, bush, or blade of grass sat over a kilometer away. All anyone could see was blackened soil, dimly glowing slag, and not much else. When the team finally came to one of the mining sites that had received a penetrating bombardment, all they found was a hole so deep, wide, and cleanly cut that it defied belief. Though Mik’s mind was still a bit muddled, he could help but pause for a moment to take in the soul shaking beauty and horror of what he saw. If the Nishnabe had decided to actually invade and take over Earth, this is the level of destruction that would have been wrought.

“Don't fall in, Mikhail.” While Mik had gotten lost peering into the inky blackness of the hole that hadn't been there an hour ago, he didn't notice as Marz crept her mech up close to his or when she opened a private comms.

“I mean, we did just get thrown out a perfectly good space ship an’ fell all the way down here. I think I could make this drop.” The man laughed in as playful a manner as he could while slowly backing his mech from the edge of what was once a mine shaft. “But, hey, yah done kicked ass out there today Marzima! I'm glad I asked yah to join us!”

“I'm glad you invited me, Mik.” Marz adjusted her mech's grip on its combination thermal lance and bladed polearm, gave it a flourishing spin, then replanted the non-bladed end into ground, all while flexing her wing-like thruster array. “I must say, it truly is a pleasure to operate one of your customized BDs. Oh, and feel free to just call me Marz. I know how you humans are with your shortened names.”

“Well, dang! Good to know yahr enjoyin’ yahrself, Marz!” For someone who normally never knew when someone was flirting, Mik was surprisingly sure he could hear that particular inflection in Marz’s deep but feminine voice. “I dunno when yah're plannin’ on headin' back to Ten'yiosh, but if we end up runnin’ another mission while yah're still hangin’ ‘round, I'll keep a cockpit open for yah.”

“Thank you, Mik. I was actually planning on continuing my vacation on Shkegpewen for at least a few more months. And, uh, my home planet is actually Sengil’yiosh. My family and I don't get along too well, so I rarely visit. I may stop by before the next deployment tour starts, but I would much rather spend time with people I consider my friends.”

“In that case, wanna come with when we head back to Sol? Yah gotta try my buddy Pedro's tacos. Best el pastor in all o’ Aram!”

Like many other notable militaries throughout the Milky Way Galaxy, the Nishnabe Militia primarily utilize standardized, locally produced equipment. From their three planet crackers class vessels, their hundreds of other void craft, and even all the way down to individually issued weapons and armor. It was all produced by a Nishnabe Industrial Zone and owned by the Confederacy as a whole. Though there is the option for volunteers and recruits to bring equipment of their own into service, just like in nearly every single other military, it was very rare for any individual person to already have anything more than a mag-sling or a suit of advanced combat armor. If someone owned their own shuttle craft, it was far more likely for that person to run a private, non-military related business. While some people like Binko Shlin, Tens's lifelong best friend, did volunteer both themselves and their own small vessels for military service, that was far from normal.

However, Binko was still back on Newport Station with his pregnant wife. So instead of loading his mech into the relatively small cargo bay of Binko's shuttle, Tens found himself in a bog standard but comparatively large Nishnabe recovery shuttle. Where Binko's inherited ship could only fit two standard-sized BDs with their reentry packs, or just the one BD-10 prototype, this standard Militia shuttle could easily accommodate the rough ten meter prototype as well as all ten of Mik's customized BD-9s that had been dropped on the Chigagorians. On top of that, there were two rows of large, comfortable seating meant for operators to relax in after their missions. Even though Mik’s custom BDs could, at least in theory, independently achieve orbit without the need of a recovery shuttle, no one wanted to test that particular capability at the moment. Instead, everyone was ready to get out of their cockpits, stretch out in cushioned chairs, and relax a bit before getting back to the Kokoji-Wango.

“How does it feel to slum it with the rest of us on a standard shuttle, Tens?” Captain Zikazoma shot Tensebwse a rather pointed glare as she sarcastically chided the man while he lazily walked to his seat next to Mik and Marz on the mech recovery craft.

“I miss Binko.” The seasoned Nishnabe warrior replied with an equally harsh and sarcastic scowl. “He always has the best snacks.”

“Yahr boy's gonna be father, niji!” Mik blurted from his seat while fiddling with harness straps. “I'm sure ‘e misses yah too. But the man's got responsibilities now! I tell yah what, I know what that's like. Havin’ a kid ain't easy. Makes yah rethink some stuff.”

“Mik…” Tens's face contorted into an almost despondent expression. “Espen was basically born as an adult. And she's so powerful that she makes Maser seem almost human. That isn't the same as having to deal with Tarki when she's hormonal. Binko's going to need us to kidnap him for a day when we get back.”

“I'm going to tell Tarki you said that!” With her helmet retracted and her face fully exposed, it was very easy to see Nashka was just playing around.

“I will fight you, little rainbow.” Tens didn't have anything non-lethal to throw at the rainbow-eyed young woman, so he simply plopped himself down into a seat next to Mik and shouted up towards the ceiling of the cargo bay of this shuttle. “Everything's secure and we're ready to take off. Bring us home, pilot.”

“Copy that.” The acknowledgement that came through the cargo bay speakers had a noticeably avian voice, but clearly wasn't the masculine tone of deep purple bird that Tens considered his best friend. “Taking off now. We'll be back on the Wango in twenty minutes, so kick back, relax, and enjoy the ride. There's also a toilet right by the door to the cockpit just in case any of you need it.”

“Thank you, Chichi!” Nashka and a few of the other Nishnabe warriors shouted their response in perfect unison. “You're the best!”

“Aye, can we smoke in ‘ere?” Mik quietly asked Tens as he felt just the slightest amount of acceleration, far less than he was expecting, and quickly realized why no one else had their harnesses buckled.

“If you smoke in my shuttle, I'll kick your ass!” The Kroke called Chichi shouted through the cargo bay speakers. “You can wait until we're back on the Wango!”

“Come on, Chich!” Nashka blurted out while smiling at the Martian professor and pulling out a thermos full of coffee from under her chair. “I'll make Basi and Shpe clean out the air filters for you tomorrow.”

“Fine, but I better not smell it.” And with that reluctant agreement from the shuttle pilot, Mik immediately pulled out a few very special cigars from a customized holster mounted to his chest armor. “And don't leave any ash piles anywhere! That stuff is a pain in the tail feather to clean.”

“You have an ashtray, right Mik?”

“What ‘bout that big ass mug yah got, Nashka?” As soon as Mik made that snark suggestion, Nashka furled her nose with disgust while several of the other Nishnabe warriors started cracking up.

“This is coffee! If any ash gets in this, I'm fighting everyone!”

“Is it traditional for your people to smoke after a victorious battle?” Marzima chimed with a curious inflection while she looked at the trio of rather thick stogies Mik had just pulled out.

“I mean… I'm a professor, not a marine…” After closely examining each of the three cannabis cigars, Mik picked one for himself, handed one to Tens, and tossed the other at Nashka. “So… I ain't really sure. But I think they drink like fish. An’ speakin’ o’ which, we got brewskies on the Wango?”

“There are six Hi-Koth, eight Kroke, and a dozen Kyim’ayik on the crew.” Having seen Mik light at least a hundred of these hand rolled smokables, Tens knew exactly what to do. “Of course there's alcohol. And if you bribe a Hi-Koth, they might give you some of their meed. But if you get so drunk that you puke, you're the one that needs to clean it up.”

“Fair enough.” With a quick pause, Mik, Tens, and Nashka all simultaneously lit their cigars, started the cherries, and took in a few deep drags.

“Cuh-huh-uh! By the Creator, Mik!” While both Mik and Tens were able to hold back their coughing, the particular special ingredient in these cigars immediately caused Nashka to let out a few harsh hacks. “What the hell did you put in this?”

“Shatter core!” Mik took one last lung-tingling hit before passing the cigar towards Marzima. “It's a cannabis concentrate with about eighty-percent THC, fifteen-percent CBD, an’ the last five-percent's a bunch o’ other cannabinoids. I used ethanol extraction, so it's perfectly pure.”

“It's good.” In just the few seconds it took for Tens to tame his puffs and pass along the blunt, the whites of his eyes were nearly as red as the Qui’ztars’ irises. “Feels like I got punched in the chest. But it's good.”

“So your people do concentrate this substance the way mine do with juki’jhuv tea.” Marz made that comment just before taking a light puff off the cigar she was just handed, then took a second, somewhat heavier drag. “I just hope this isn't as addictive as juki’jhuv concentrate.”

“Nah, this ain't anywhere close to that kinda concentrate.” Mik laughed as he received the stogie back from Marz, who suddenly had a wide-eyed look on her face from the effects of pungent and potent smoke. “We got somethin’ similar back in Sol an’ I ain't ‘bout to put none o’ that in a rollie. This cannabis flower basically ain't physically addictive at all. Mentally, a bit. But not physically. It'll definitely make yah hungry as hell, though.”

“In that case,” The Qui’ztar Sub-Admiral passed the blunt to Zika as she glanced towards Mik with a now droopy-eyed expression. “I'm looking forward to a beer and a nice slab of meat.”",9,1739387740.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

The new place won't give me my infusion until my doctor can see me. By the time I even get scheduled for an appointment, I will be past due","Let me preface this by saying that I never got gleeful when the United Healthcare provider was killed. Insurance has helped me out. And the ability to take a Biologic medication is limited to North America and Europe. Some single payer countries have copays that make a biologic inaccessible. I'm not saying that there aren't problems with American healthcare, but I am sober from alcohol and it's completely changed my perspective to where I try to be grateful and don't get as worked up anymore. I definitely was a dick before I got sober to insurance people. I've also been in remission for a minute, so I look at what I can be grateful for. 

That being said the amount of executive functioning it requires to get the biologic is crazy. In the U.S., last year, this same insurance covered my old infusion place. This year I was told late that it isn't covered. By the time I was told that I called the new place. I've been on the phone all day and by the time I sorted it out I couldn't get an appointment in time.

I'm diagnosed with Schozoaffective (Schizophrenia and Bipolar) and ADHD. These mess up executive functioning. I'm working full time as a software engineer and taking Computer Science courses at college. The only way I've been able to counteract they mental stuff is by running 5 or more miles every day or cycling for an hour. Some days I also swim or lift. 

I couldn't run with Crohn's for years. Even in remission. I was put on Wellbutrin for a Bipolar depressive episode - and when I drank coffee on that med I was energetic and anxious. As dysfunctional as it sounds I just did that and ran until I was in good shape again. 

My biggest worry is that I will flare and be unable to workout. I'm not sure if I could do work and school if that happened. Hopefully I will be alright though. 

I literally dropped out of school and didn't return for five years until January. I'm 37 and I just want to be done with it. I'm hoping that things get sorted out. I also don't have a problem with being persistent and trying to get seen earlier",2,1739387707.0,CrohnsDisease,2,1.0,False

(And to anyone else who's interested).,"In my opinion, the coffee gear site really fumbled the launch of the tumbler. It's fun to get collectible exclusives and a lot of people didn't get the tumbler who wanted one.

I've found a lot of tumblers, whether it's from the Stanley website, or less expensive brands that are comparable, and customizable.

Sone of my fellow store partners and I were really surprised when we started looking into it, because we found that for as little as half the price, we could get completely customized tumblers and stainless steel bottles with laser engraving.

You can have just about any design laser engraved on any color you want, customize the color of the lid, the straw, and have something completely personal and unique.

This might not be news to a lot of people, but I just wanted to share for people that misssed out and want something cool.

There are local places and small businesses that will do the laser engraving, you can order 3-D printed straw toppers from small, independent businesses, and help support people who are trying to make a living doing something creative and artistic. 

With stencils, you can use nail polish to paint designs, and if it doesn't come out right, use nail polish remover to clean it and start over, and when you get the design perfect, put a clear coat over it to preserve it.

There are types of paint that work really well too, but imo nail polish works great because I make a lot of mistakes so the easy-to-remove and redo part helps a lot lol.

At craft stores, you can get fabrics and even leather/ faux leather to make a wrap / cozy for it, and I even found metallic tape in copper, brass, silver, that you can make an impression on to look like filigree.

A few friends I work with are collecting some supplies and making our own, and it feels a lot more fun and involved than ordering something from the Starbucks site.

So if you missed out on the partner tumbler, and like customizing things and crafty hobbies, I recommend looking into it. 

As someone who has a few collections, I get that it's not an officially licensed collectible exclusive, and that's part of the appeal of the partner Stanley. But as someone who didn't get one, im actually looking forward to seeing how our custom made ones come out more than I wanted the partner exclusive one.

Im really into creative expression, indulging in artistic hobbies, and making things, and im surprised at how much fun im having planning out what I'm going to make. 

I know a drinking cup doesn't solve all the problems we face as partners, and might not be a perfect sibstitue for being disappointed with the way the tumbler launched, but I hope that everyone can find some fun and rewarding ways to express our unique personalities. Whether it's on a tumbler or anything else.

I wish all my fellow partners the best, and please know that I respect and cherish all the people who make working at Starbucks the amazing experience it's supposed to be.",4,1739387676.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False

“Matt shot himself.” It was my son, Jared, on the phone. I couldn’t believe my ears. Was this a dream? Would I awaken and realize it was a terrible nightmare? No, it was Jared’s voice. “Mom, are you there?” “Jared, what are you trying to tell me?” I replied. He shouted into the phone, *“Matt shot himself.”*  
   
I had married young, just barely after my 21st birthday. The day I walked down the aisle, I had seriously worried who would be the drunkest, my dad or my new husband. Yes, I knew I was marrying an alcoholic, but I was sure that I could change him.  
   
After 36 years of doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results, I called it quits and divorced my husband. The last five years of our marriage, I had sunk deeper and deeper into depression, taking a sabbatical from my position as senior pastor at a recently established medium-sized church. During my sabbatical, I isolated myself and moved to an island in South Carolina known as the “end of the road,” in the real sense of the word—next stop, the Bahamas.  
   
The only time I ventured out of my condo was to attend a Monday morning women’s group.  Occasionally, I would agree to go to the local coffee shop afterwards with some of the women. That’s how I met a woman who became my best friend.  
   
Early in September in 2005, I admitted to her my story, and the misery and sense of powerlessness I had living with alcoholism. To which she replied, “I know where you can get help.” “Me? Get help? It was my husband’s problem, not mine!” Lovingly, she replied, “I know where you can get help.”  
   
I had no idea she, too, was living with alcoholism in her family, and had been attending Al‑Anon for years. Immediately, she put me in touch with two different women whom I could call that very day, and every day that week, until she would personally take me to the Sunday night Al‑Anon meeting. I made the calls and found loving, caring people on the phone line who understood everything I was going through.  
   
At my weekly Al‑Anon meetings, I consistently heard my story in 20 different versions. Not only did the other people at the meeting identify with my story, they were all willing to share their personal experience, strength, and hope. Through sharing and studying the Twelve Steps, I began to see myself and my situation more clearly.  
   
I learned that I was flirting with insanity by doing the same things, expecting different results, for 36 years. I found it necessary to admit, accept, and subject myself to a Higher Power that could and would help me to recover. I learned that I could trust and depend on other Al‑Anon members to be supportive, to maintain anonymity, and to be available to talk at any time.   
   
As I studied the Twelve Steps of recovery each week, I began to regain my sense of personhood and value. In 2008, I came to the conclusion that my participation in an unhealthy relationship with my husband had to end. Even though divorce is tragic, I felt the happiest, and more like myself, than I had in years. I was poor as dirt, living in my friend’s condo, yet more at peace with myself than I had ever been.  
   
I begged my grown sons to go to Al‑Anon. Then, I realized I could only control my own behavior and no one else’s, including my own sons. As far as my husband’s alcoholism and drug addiction, I didn’t cause it, couldn’t control it, and sure as heck could not cure it. But when I divorced him, my son, Matt, took up with his dad where I left off. He became his dad’s caretaker in almost every way that I had for 36 years of marriage.  
  
Over the course of two years, trying his hardest to control his dad’s addictions, Matt became very depressed. My son, Jared, his wife, and I all worried and tried to convince Matt to get professional help.  
Try as we might we could not convince Matt to get help. Shortly before he died, I told him, “Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.” I have often wondered if my words were the wrong thing to say to my son. Yet, I am aware that no one’s words caused him to commit suicide.   
   
The horror of his death has affected just about every aspect of my life. I would be lost without my Al‑Anon group and the understanding and support I receive there. I found myself eating my own words, “Get help.” I maintain participation in Al‑Anon, a suicide/grief support group, and a spiritual personal relationship with my Higher Power that includes prayer and reflection. It is true—pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.  
  
Now, two years after Matt’s death, I am ready and willing to share my personal experience, strength, and hope with others. I am convinced I didn’t cause Matt’s death. I couldn’t control his actions and I sure couldn’t cure him. All I could do, at that time, was love him and encourage him. All I can do now is love him and pray for him. I had to let him go; but I will always love him.  
   
Today, I am attending a workshop to learn about Alateen. While Matt’s suicide challenged us all in our relationships with each other, my son Jared and I have a much stronger mother/son relationship. I am now married to a man who is available to me on a spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional level. His strength and support are indeed a blessing. I was able to resume my profession. I am newly retired and looking forward to working with Alateens and traveling with my husband in our RV.   
   
My husband and I are doubly blessed with Jared, his wife and two small children, my husband’s daughter, her husband and two young children. Together, we have four lovely grandchildren, a huge family, and circle of friends. And I still have my mother and step-dad. I try to focus on what we have, not what we have lost or who is not here in this world.  
   
Did I graduate from Al‑Anon? The answer is no. Help is available. It’s up to me to go out and get it!

1inyz31,https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1inyz31/buckbreaking_or_the_true_story_of_why_no_one_else/,"Buckbreaking, or the true story of why no one else has done a bad history on Tariq Nasheed’s magnum opus and assault upob history, truth, and good taste.","Buckbreaking remains the Mount Everest of Badhistory. Tariq Nasheed’s bizarre racist homophobic “documentary” puts the works of such luminaries of lies as Ben Stein, Michael Moore, and Kirk Cameron to shame. No other work of pseudohistory has managed to capture the public’s imagination or been the source of so much mean-spirited mirth.  But how does Buckbreaking twist history and what is the truth behind their malicious myth? 


Here’s the film if you want to follow along

https://archive.org/details/10000000-482553349623990-3303687090294859959-n

You don’t want to follow along


We begin with Tariq Nasheed, or k-Flex as he used to call himself. Tariq Nasheed is a conman  and internet personality who made many films and wrote multiple books about how to “mack”. What macking is and how it’s done I leave as an exercise to the readers imagination.

Buckbreaking is not his first “documentary”. He’s produced multiple others in a series called “Hidden Colors”.  Buckbreaking remains his most successful  and his most infamous.

Buckbreaking makes the startling and frankly insane claim that homosexual rape has been used systematically throughout history by white men to dominate black men and that it was a common practice in all of white societies. 

The film is mostly homophobia, transphobia, and anti-white racism. So much so that I’m not even going to try to debunk it because it would drown out the more interesting bad history. Just assume any gaps are full of racism, sexism, homophobia, antisemitism, transphobia, and hatred against anyone who’s not a black heterosexual American man. 

I will also ignore all falsehoods not related directly to history Thus I will skip over the bad anthropology of “sun age vs ice age”, the bad religion of dividing the human race into first order and second order beings, the bad mythology of claiming Pan was the god of fucking goats and that Ganymede would appear and randomly rape men, and insanity like “the fraud of white masculinity” and “white masculinity is based on sodomy”. 

I’m also going to treat all these people as Tariq Nasheed speaking. It’s his film and he chose to let these people babble on about ice age savagery and lynchings actually being a way for white people to vampiricly suck the youth and life force of young black men. I’m holding him responsible.

If you wish to follow along, but why would you, buckbreaking can be watched for free on the internet archive.

3:24

The claim about Mark Twain admitting we’ve “ground the manhood out of the negro” is..true, although they spoil the effect with a poor photoshop of a black men being shoved into a meatgrinder and remove it from the context of him helping pay for the education of one of the first black men at Yale and explaining why he would refuse to do the same for a white man.  


7:34 
“Black India”

Racial classifications are arbitrary and often nonsensical, but under no system would the Indians be classified as “black”. Except for the Siddis, who are muslims descended from Bantu slaves taken to India who are now considered their own unique ethnic group. 

8:00

I’m not looking up the rules of pederastery in Ancient Greece and Rome, but the fact that he claims the rules were the same in both Greece and Rome leads me to believe he’s making this up. 

10:40

“ the small penises of Greek and Roman statuary”

As the National Institute for Health tells us“the ideal type of male beauty epitomized in classical sculpture, normally depicts genitals of average or less than average size. “ Large or oversized penises are reserved for grotesque animalistic figures such as Priapus, Bacchus, or Pan as they were considered freakish or bestial.


11:53

“White Arabs”

I suppose you could claim Arabs are white. 

13:31

“The most feared fighters were the gays”
Attitudes towards homosexuality in Ancient Greece varied by city-state. 

13:42
“The Catholic Church is a gay institution”

This would be news to literally everyone

14:40

“Homosexuality..In Africa…That homosexuality was brought by white muslims.”

This is a complete lie. Homosexual practice existed in a wide variety of pre-colonial subsaharan African cultures. Whether homophobia is a modern import or traditionally African remains something of a controversy, but that’s a conversation for people 
smarter than me to have.


“The Mamluks the slave soldiers of Islam”
The Mamelukes were in Northern Africa and did not have significant influence in Subsaharan Africa. Also the mamluks, as often happened with slave soldiers, came to rule the empire. 

14:53
“The first thing the pope sees in the morning is the obelisk. The obelisk represents the (czars?) erect penis… an erect black penis”

For the sake of my sanity I’m assuming he meant the Caesars of the Roman Empire and isn’t claiming the Russian Czars were black.  The only Roman emperor you could possibly claim as black was Septimus Severus, and that was only because he was born in North Africa and had darker skin than most Romans. Here’s the family portrait. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Severan_dynasty_-_tondo.png

Also that can’t be his penis because the obelisk was erected, or rather moved there from Egypt, during the reign of Caligula who lived centuries earlier. 

The Obelisk was erected in its current location by Pope Sixtus V. 

As for it being a penis? The obelisk was originally adorned with a bronze ball at the tip representing the sun and currently bears a cross. If your penis looks like that seek medical help.

There’s also something about the pope removing penises? No idea what he’s talking about there

16:32
“Sexual exploitation of black women”

This is sadly true.

16:45 

“Sexual exploitation of black men”

But this isn’t.

16:51 

“The whole European expansion was a homosexual enterprise”

I’m just going to assume you know why this is a stupid and move on.

16:51

“Most victorian colonels were homosexuals”


Then why was it illegal and considered immoral if all the people with guns were engaging in it? This would indicate either a conspiracy or a bizarre cultural kayfabe. Or that he’s just making this up. I’m going with the latter.

17:15

“European colonies were seen as homosexual playgrounds”

Which colonies? When? Where?


18:22

“Thomas Thistlewood raped black men”

I’ve found no evidence of this, and can’t directly access Thomas Thistlewood’s extensive elaboration of his many crimes, but it wouldn’t surprise me. Thistlewood was  a sexual predator of the most dangerous sort. 


19:06
“James Hammond was gay and had gay sex with his slaves”
Much of what they’re saying about James Hammond is true. James Hammond was probably a bisexual and certainly a sexual predator, but there’s no evidence he raped his male slaves. He molested his four nieces, a slave girl, and his own daughter. His wife left him and took the children with her. A more perfect figure of southern gothic villainy is impossible to picture, but there’s no evidence of him doing anything like buckbreaking. If anything his tyranny seems to be more of a desire to control and generalized incompetency. He mourned the death of his slaves in a disgustingly self-pitying matter. 


20:07
“Lord Cornbury was a transgender woman who helped expand slavery in America”


Lord Cornbury was not transgender. He was accused of transvestitism but that and transgenderism are too very different things. In addition it is now believed the claims of transvestism was invented to discredit him. Also he wasn’t instrumental in anything.


21:10 
“There were bucbkbreaking farms”

Bucbkreaking farms. I can’t disprove this because it’s like disproving the existence of unicorns. 



24: 40

“Black infants were put in dresses to feminize them”


This is false.
All infants wore dresses. As the Maryland center for History and culture explains “ In the 18th and 19th centuries, infants' and toddlers' clothing dictated more their age than their gender.  Infants wore long, white dresses similar to today's christening dress style until they could walk.  Once the child started to walk, the long dresses were swapped for shorter styles that mimicked contemporary women's fashions. ” It made changing their diapers easier.

26:11

Peter Sawelly or Beefsteak Pete or Mary Jones

As Peter Sawelly identified as a man I will treat him as such. He was a thief masquerading as a female prostitute and preying upon unsuspecting drunkards. Whether he was a homosexual desiring contact with men or simply an opportunist is a question lost to time. 


26:42
“The slaves were given censored bibles”


The claim about the censored Slave Bibles are true. Score one for Tariq

29:00

Madame Lalaurie’s mansion of horrors where she tortured people and made a person into a crab

Everything here except for the crab is true

But this has nothing to do with buckbreaking

32:01

“Jeffrey Dahmer was a serial rapist in the military”

Maybe. We have later testimony by someone who said he was consistently raped by Jeffrey Dahmer, which doesn’t fit his modus operandi at all. Jeffrey Dahmer killed men and performed necrophilia on their corpses. Anyone raped by him would have shown severe damage. Then again, he was drinking constantly and it could be he got the other guy blackout drunk and then raped him in his sleep. What we know for sure is that the rape didn’t come out until later, and it was only one guy.  It might have happened, and it might not have. 

39:14

“Tinya laws forbid black women from sharing their hair in public in Louisiana”

I can’t find anything about this. If any of you can feel free to share.


40:24
“Runaway slaves in Louisiana were branded with the fleur de lis. . Which is now on the helmets of the New Orlean’s Saints”


The story of branding runaway slaves with the fleur de lis is true. But it was usually done on the shoulder. It being the logo of the New Orleans saints is an unfortunate coincidence.

43:06 

“Cecil Rhodes was gay”

“Hitler was a pedophile”

Cecil Rhodes might have been a homosexual. Score ~~one~~ ~~two~~ three for Tariq and friends.

Do I really need a source to defend Hitler from the clam he was using the Hitler Youth as catamites? This is what Buckbreaking has led to: I’m being forced to defend Hitler from slander. 


“The Pink Swastika “

The pInk Swastika is a work of psuedohistory  that claims the Nazi party was fundamentally gay. This is giving the Nazis, which was less a political movement and more a cult worshipping Jew genocide and Adolf Hitler as a living god, too much credit. While there were homosexuals in the Nazi party those not aligned to the party or without connections were killed. 

43:20

“Robert  Badin-Powell was a homosexual who set up the boy scouts to give him easy access to boys”


Robert Badin-Powell may have been  a homosexual, but he wasn’t treating the boy scouts as his personal harem.
 

43:40

“The Boy Scouts were a white nationalist organization.”

The first black Boy Scout Troop was formed in 1911.


43:50

“The Boy Scouts influence the Hitler Youth”

Of course it did. Hitler did away with all competing youth groups  and the Boy Scouts was the most successful youth group on the planet. He’d be a fool not to rip them off.


45:05 

“J Edgar Hoover was gay”

Maybe. But he made a lot of powerful enemies with his reckless use and abuse of power and homosexuality was a common smear at the time.


45:56

“Roy Cohn was gay”
 He said he wasn’t and that he just liked to have sex with men.

“Roy Cohn persecuted Paul Robeson”
Yes. He was on the committee that called Paul Robeson to testify on the House committee on Unamerican Activities. They filched his passport and the the Supreme court made them give it back. This had absolutely nothing to do with Roy Cohn being gay. 

“Why did Roy Cohn sue Dr. martin Luther king jr for libel? “

He didn’t; he represented a police officer who did. If we pilloried every lawyer who take an awful case than we’d run out of every lawyers. Don’t condemn him for that; condemn him for being a self-hating homosexual who took out his self-loathing on other homosexual men during the lavender scare of the fifties.

47:32

“Jim Jones was bisexual”

“900-1000 dead black people”

This is partially true. What is false is the claim all the victims were black when it was a mix.

52:28 

“Elizabeth Kady Stenton and Susan B Anthony doesn’t care about black people.”

Susan B Anthony was an abolitionist and personally met with Frederick Douglas. She was so anti-slavery she was hung in effigy in Syracuse. Elizabeth Kady Stenton was also active in antislavery activities.


57:23 

“The Confessions of Nat Turner is a hit job meant to make Nat Turner look bad”

They don’t seem to know The Confessions of Nat Turner is fiction. 

58:49

“Stonewall was a black uprising against the police”

Stonewall has dozens of people claiming “it was me” or “it was us”. Tariq Nasheed’s just another one trying to claim credit for the riot. 


59:53

“They saying Malcon X was gay”

He wasn’t. He was a straight man who, in his criminal youth, had gay sex for money. He was a gigolo, not gay. Rather than feeling victimized he believed he was taking advantage of gay men and was proud of this. 

1:00:08

“Saying Benjamin Banneker is gay”

If he was he kept it well hidden. Whether he was gay or not  Benjamin Banneker was amazing. He was a black gentleman scientist and self-taught astronomer who built the first clock made in America out of wood and corresponded with the founding fathers.


1:00:23

“The Rainbow flag was ripped off from the rainbow coalition”

It’s not. The rainbow flag was inspired by actual rainbows, since the artist saw rainbows as “flags of the sky”.

1:02:45 

“Richard Pryor caused out an audience full of white lgbt people”

This is an accurate retelling, but they neglect that Pryor was bisexual and did a whole bit about how much he loves sucking dick. Also I really wish I was watching Richard Pryor instead of this.

1:04:49

“The connection between Nambla and the gay rights movement”
“David Thorstadt”

I’m not touching this

1:11:52
“Gloria Steinem worked for the CIA”

Gloria Steinem did work for a Cia-run student organization, but that doesn’t mean she was working for the CIA. She accepted their money but their relationship was far more quid pro quid.


1:13:25

 “Bayard Rustin was a CIA asset”

I’ve found no evidence of this smear and the FBI’s files on him give no proof.

1:15:34

“Moorish children in paintings show pedophilia”
Special Thanks to Tineye reverse image 

The first picture is Portrait of a Lady in a Turquoise Garment with a Young Moor Serving Coffee. While slavery is shameful I see no evidence that the elegant older lady is using her slave for anything more than involuntary unpaid housework.

The second image is Louise de Kéroualle, Duchess of Portsmouth, mistress of King Charles II with an unknown  adult female attendant holding a conch full of pearls and a piece of coral. Yes. That’s a woman. If you’re wondering why she’s painted like that it’s because the mistress of a man like Charles II would do everything in her power to avoid competition. 

The third image is Françoise Marie de Bourbon with her page. Francçoise Marie de Bourbon was an illegitimate daughter of king Louis XIV. Her main historical accomplishments seemed to be sitting for portraits. Also she probably wasn’t molesting the page.

The fourth image is a portrait of Peter the Great with a black page , not a concubine. The page in the image is too young to be Peter the Great’s protege Abram Petrovitch Gannibal, the astonishing black general, artillery specialist, gentleman scientist, and great-grandfather of Alexander Pushkin,  but it might be a reference or tribute to him.

1:18:54

““The Lost Boys of Bird Island” is true story of how Apartheid officials sexually abused children on the pedophile’s paradise of Bird Island” 

I feel unclean after writing that. The Bird Island story is probably a hoax. Not only is there no real evidence it’s an overly elaborate conspiracy when it would be easier to just plant one of the conspiracy in charge of a juvenile correction facility.

The dirt won’t come off no matter how  much I scrub. 

1:22:34


“Epstein”

No

1:26:37

“Ronald Dominique was a mass killer targeting black men”

This is true. Now I’m just sad. On the plus side he’s currently doing life without parole.


1:31:51

“The typical hoodrat thug is a lesbian in a boy’s body”

What


That was Buckbreaking, a disjointed mess of talking heads blathering nonsense for what feels like hours. How well does it support it’s thesis and claims? It doesn’t. Tariq just lets his weird friends blabber on about any fool thing that pops into their head. 

 Of all of these strange people I forced myself to spend time wih Judge Joe Brown was my favourite. His bizarre confused grandpa/Drunk uncle energy was a refreshing change from the other frauds and lunatics Tariq Nasheed has chosen to surround himself with. Most of the others were either cultists, creeps, or charlatans. Absolutely none of them made a coherent argument or point.

This probably came across as a disjointed nonsensical nightmare. It is. Because that’s what Buckbreaking is.

This is not a fun bad film.There are occasional moments of levity but it’s just a never-ending cavalcade of disjointed nonsense spewing into your eyes without rhyme or reason. Not only is it nonsensical its also contradictory. They can’t decide if they love or hate “the black church”, “lgbt”, or “black women”.  Each of those gaps between topics is like a thousand years of madness. It’s a rollercoaster ride into the grave of all rational thought. Do not watch this alone. Do not watch the whole thing. Do not watch this at all.

EARLY ACCESS UPDATE 3, which is really the 5th overall update, is live! It includes a NEW STAGE, a new LANGUAGE MENU for TRANSLATIONS, fixes some bugs, tweaks STAGE artwork, and makes adjustments to some STAGE layouts and OBJECT PLACEMENT.

**NEW:**  
\+ NEW STAGE: JUMP & GRIND   
A new STAGE has been added to FARM FLASHBACK. This is the last STAGE for this EPISODE!

\+ NEW FEATURE: LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONS   
A first pass on adding in language translations, starting with Spanish. There may be a few places where translations need to be added, and those will come along with support for additional languages.

\+ ROASTYTERM v1.30: UI UPDATE   
ROASTYTERM has been updated to VERSION 1.30. The UI has been tweaked for better 8-bit readability.

**CHANGES:**  
\+ STAGE LAYOUT Updates   
There's been updates to almost every STAGE: Layout changes, moving around objects and adding/subtracting them, to better balance the game and make it more fun to play!

\+ CHANGE: Game Optimizations   
Optimizations were done to increase performance and eliminate some of the occasional frame hitches that can occur on the VCS when the fans kicks on. As a side effect of the optimization, PLAY MOVEMENT should overall be a bit smoother visually, especially when climbing ladders.

**FIXES:**  
\+ Fixed Trampoline Smoke

1inyvnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1inyvnd/adtx_big_time_gamble/,$ADTX big time gamble,"🚀 10 Reasons ADTX Could Send Your Portfolio to the Moon

1. Tiny Market Cap = Massive Moves – ADTX is so small that a handful of over-caffeinated Reddit traders could send it soaring with enough volume. If a hedge fund sneezes in its direction, we might see liftoff.


2. Reverse Split Already Done – Unlike other penny stocks just waiting to rug-pull you with a reverse split, ADTX already took its medicine. That means we probably won’t wake up to another dilution nuke—at least not this week.


3. Short Squeeze Fuel – If enough degenerate traders pile in, this stock could have shorts running for the hills. Nothing like watching a hedge fund panic-cover while you sip your morning coffee.


4. Biotech = Buzzword Jackpot – ""Immunotherapy"" and ""biotech innovation"" sound like the kind of things that make institutional investors drool. If ADTX can slap together a half-decent press release, the hype alone could send it skyward.


5. Playing the M&A Game – The company is buying up assets and forming partnerships. If even one of these acquisitions turns out to be useful instead of a money pit, it could add real value.


6. Insider Buying Could Be a Green Flag – If executives start loading up on their own stock, they either know something we don’t, or they’re just as reckless as we are. Either way, bullish.


7. Low Liquidity = Wild Swings – Since ADTX doesn’t trade much volume, a little bit of buying pressure could send it into orbit. Of course, this works both ways—so buckle up.


8. Hype-Driven Market – This is 2025, where fundamentals are a suggestion, and a single viral tweet can double a stock’s price. If ADTX finds itself in the right narrative, it could run hard.


9. FOMO Magnet – If the stock starts moving, retail traders will chase it like drunk frat guys after a beer pong victory. Early entries win; late ones get left holding the bag.


10. Undervalued (Or Just Forgotten?) – It’s trading near all-time lows, which means two things: (1) It’s either a hidden gem waiting to be discovered or (2) It’s a flaming dumpster no one wants to touch. But hey, what if…?




---

💀 10 Reasons ADTX Might Set Your Portfolio on Fire (And Not in a Good Way)

1. Bleeding Cash Like a Vegas Tourist – ADTX is spending money like it just hit a jackpot—except there’s no jackpot, and they’re at the ATM taking out another advance.


2. Dilution is Inevitable – Biotech companies love issuing new shares, and ADTX is no exception. If they need more cash (spoiler: they do), they’ll print shares faster than the Fed.


3. Penny Stock Chaos – This thing trades under a buck, which means it’s basically a slot machine with a stock ticker. Get in and out before the house wins.


4. Reverse Split PTSD – They already did one reverse split, which means another could be lurking around the corner like a horror movie jump scare.


5. Revenue? What Revenue? – ADTX has plenty of potential but not much in the way of actual money coming in. You know, that thing companies need to survive?


6. Regulatory Russian Roulette – Biotech stocks live and die by FDA approvals, and the process is slower than a sloth on tranquilizers. One bad ruling could nuke this thing overnight.


7. Fighting in the Big Leagues – ADTX is trying to play in a space dominated by pharma giants with deeper pockets, bigger brains, and actual revenue. Good luck.


8. Low Liquidity = Tough Exit – That thin trading volume that makes ADTX move fast? Yeah, it also means you might be stuck holding the bag if no one wants to buy your shares.


9. Macro Risks are Real – If the market tanks, speculative plays like this get crushed first. The Fed sneezes, and ADTX could drop like a rock.


10. It’s a Straight-Up Gamble – Let’s not kid ourselves. This isn’t a blue-chip investment. It’s a high-risk lottery ticket with a chance of a big payday or a complete wipeout. Invest accordingly.




---

Final Thoughts: Are You Degenerate Enough?

ADTX is not a safe investment—it’s a high-risk, high-reward moonshot. If you’re buying, it’s because you either believe in the company’s long-term prospects or you just enjoy the adrenaline rush of gambling with your portfolio.

This could be a legendary win or a catastrophic loss. No in-between. Are you rolling the dice or sitting on the sidelines?


P.S. 
As of now, Aditxt has not yet initiated human clinical trials but is actively progressing toward them. Here's an overview of their current research activities:

Preclinical Studies:

ADI-100 for Autoimmune Diseases: Aditxt's subsidiary, Adimune, has successfully completed preclinical efficacy and safety studies for their antigen-specific gene therapy, ADI-100. In mouse models, ADI-100 prevented hyperglycemia in 70% of treated mice and provided durable protection lasting over 300 days. These results position ADI-100 for first-in-human clinical trials, marking a significant milestone in transforming the treatment landscape for autoimmune diseases. 

Mitomic® Prostate Test (MPT™): Pearsanta, another Aditxt subsidiary, has submitted a grant application to advance clinical trials for the MPT™, a blood test designed for early detection of prostate cancer. The proposed study aims to validate the test in its CLIA/CAP facility in Virginia, followed by a randomized clinical trial to determine its effectiveness in identifying men with PSA levels in the gray zone who may have clinically significant prostate cancer. 


Upcoming Human Clinical Trials:

ADI-100 for Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS): Adimune has signed a clinical trial agreement with Mayo Clinic to advance studies targeting autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system, with an initial focus on SPS. The collaboration will include both preclinical and clinical studies, aiming to restore immune tolerance in patients suffering from these disorders. 


In summary, while Aditxt has not yet commenced human clinical trials, their subsidiaries are making significant progress in preclinical research and are preparing to initiate first-in-human studies in the near future.

I’m a 30-year-old guy software developer from Asker/Oslo(Norway) who traded an *Asian summer* for *Norwegian snowstorms* (best decision ever). I moved here for work, but let’s be real—I mostly stayed for the skiing, hiking, and the *all-you-can-breathe fresh air buffet*.

Looking for a cool person to explore new places with, do fun activities, and hopefully build something meaningful—starting with friendship and letting it grow into something beautiful (like a sourdough starter, but with less stress).

A bit about me:

* Vegetarian 🌱.
* Not really into clubbing, but down for a glass of wine (or whatever fuels your existential crises) over dinner with friends.
* Love skiing—both cross-country and downhill (because why choose one when you can fall gracefully in multiple ways?).
* Used to play guitar, but it’s been in hibernation. If you love music, maybe we can wake it up together! 🎸
* Can cook! Which means you *might* get free food if you play your cards right.
* My Norwegian is *okish*, meaning I can order food, survive small talk, and probably make some awkward grammar mistakes.

If you’re up for fun adventures, good laughs, and possibly watching me attempt (and fail) to make perfectly round chapatis, hit me up!

Let’s go on a hike, ski trip, or just share embarrassing life stories over coffee. 🚀.

First of all I’d like to say I don’t mind tipping out bartenders when they’re making drinks for me it’s not like I could do it myself. What is upsetting me is I just found out that as a server I’m tipping bar out like 3 percent I believe (not 100 percent sure exactly what the tip out is I’ll have to double check) regardless of it I have alcohol sales or not. It was a slow morning today and I made $100 in tips thinking I was gonna be able to keep it all and ended up leaving with less than that even though I had 6 tables and not a single one of them purchased and alcoholic beverage meaning the bar didn’t do anything for it. I was irritated and asked my manager why am I tipping out still and he said “company policy because the bartender cut lemons and limes and they also make lattes and cappuccinos”. Here’s the catch NONE of them do anything of those things. The opening server cuts lemons and limes and us servers make our own cappuccinos and lattes. The coffee station isn’t even anywhere near the bar. Hell a lot of times the bartenders will ask us to make caps and lattes for them as a favor because it’s too far from the bar. 

My question is, is this even legal?? And if not would it be worth trying to prove and get back wages because I tip out A LOT to bartenders everyday and that significantly adds up. It pisses me off that restaurants are so greedy that they can pay us $2.14 and hour and are still able to steal our tips to pay their other employees.

*to piggyback off of this the same restaurant has hired a “busser” that we tip out 1 percent who barely busses tables. They have her food running most of the time, I believe they just have her clock in as a busser so that she doesn’t take away from the other two food runners tip out (we also tip them out) ",2,1739387033.0,legaladvice,3,1.0,False

Long story short, my ex (24F) and I (28M) dated for about a year and a half, although it felt like many more years because of the amazing chemistry we had. We were head over heels in love with each other, but unfortunately, I am a recovering pill addict and my addiction was the poison of our relationship.. I’m talking about all the lying straight to her face about not using even though I loved her. After about 3-4 chances, that was it and we broke up, it was almost a mutual breakup as I simply could not keep hurting her because of my addiction as she deserved better than me just lying throughout our relationship about my addiction. Besides all the negatives that came with a partner actively in an addiction on a relationship, we were what people would call the perfect couple. 

Either way, been clean for about 5 months now as I was only able to do it when I was doing for myself, not for her. I have a very specific plan towards my recovery. I had to work on restoring my relationship with God, with myself, and now I’m at the stage where I am doing the same with all of the people that I’ve hurt along the way because of my addiction. Not necessarily trying to bring everything back to normal or even get back with her, but at least apologize for everything, all of the lying all of the anxiety that I caused her when I would be out with my friends, and everything that came with my addition. Even though we have not been together for 6+ months, we obviously still care about each other to a certain extent, and she will always have a special place in my heart. Being completely honest, even though I have left with plenty of people ever since, I cannot stop thinking about her. we are on good terms even though we don’t talk much. 

From a woman’s perspective, is this even worth it? Any advice or input on situation would be much appreciated. If I’m being honest, I always think of her as “the one that got away” since I completely sabotaged a beautiful relationship because of drug use.

So, I took the existing rules (Morbid, Cute Coffee Gal, etc.) and made one that is much ""simpler"" and fits my interests. I based it on a few, fantastical, ridiculous pillars: 1) I recently got Life and Death and found the Tarot collection to be interesting, 2) I love witches, 3) I like playing as a woman (stick to what you know). 

The rules I set up for myself:

* I am not keeping track of every year - just the decades themselves. Loosely. It will be my intent to have my heirs start having children as YA's. 
* The goal is to have a family line go through the decades and each heir collects a Tarot card in the deck. Working back from 2020's, that starts me at 1770. I'll have reached the ""end"" if I make it to 2020s and that heir finds the final Tarot card for the deck! 
* I will keep the default lifespans and seasons on:
   * Newborn for a day, toddler for 7, YA for 28, so on.
   * One season is 7 Sim days. 
   * This gives me four seasons = one year. The math isn't *exactly* mathing here, but Sims live in dog years anyway! I'll have to use my imagination. 
* I started with a married couple and had two kids. I've read too many summer-reads about witches, so I was inspired by that. She became a spellcaster, and her mean husband ""disappeared"" after two children. Thus starts the family of powerful women? We will see.
* I've recently learned that spellcaster traits may or may not be passed down? Playing with that idea:
   * If my female children are born spellcasters, they will be the heir. If no female children are born, or none are born as spellcasters, then the heir will be the oldest male. 
* I set myself up a basic spreadsheet to keep track of my heirs, and to help decide deaths as appropriate. I will use odds to decide deaths based on significant wars, pandemics, etc. Not every decade -- just some major ones. 
* Still trying to abide by time-period appropriate things as I can - I do not use CC! (I don't know how, really, and my Mac would blow up.)

Has anyone else simplified the Decades challenge? Any major holes here that will ruin me before I really start?",2,1739386833.0,LowSodiumSimmers,1,1.0,False
1inyoxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1inyoxs/can_we_do_more/,Can we do more?,"As the tariffs are actually hitting and already taking toll on some businesses in the US and Canada, is there a way we can be more visible, help boost morale? I keep thinking of things I’d like to see happen but I can’t really bring them to fruition as one person. Maybe any ideas or suggestions we all have could be compiled in one place - some of us may be better positioned to move things forward. My brain dump of small and completely giant and ridiculous ideas below:

Be more visible by….
- posting about the tariff issues on social media
- find ways to wear our opposition to the threats against Canada through pins, patches, shirts, etc., and maybe finding a way to get items like that to the US so they’re visible there too
- Encouraging Canadian actors and musician with American and international audiences to use their power to make it clear they disapprove of Trump’s threats
- Anti Tesla bumper stickers (""Tell your Tesla my fellow Canadians say f*** off""»?)
- Create a petition to take away Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian citizenship or title as ""the great one"" in response to his Trump support (I realize this wouldn’t actually result in those things happening, but maybe a public campaign against Gretzky gives this more attention in American media?)
- Could we write a letter against Trump and have as many people sign it? Maybe to make it more visible a physical letter could be more effective? It could go province to province to show visible line ups of people wanting to sign it? And maybe we could also send it to states where people want to sign
- if a sales person in a store that carries goods from both Canada and the US asks you if they can help you, ask them where you can find Canadian products of what you’re looking for, even if you know what you need to remind them you’re not buying American 
- remind your provincial and federal reps of the actions they were going to take when Trump originally threatened tariffs - he’s still aiming to go through with it so we should follow through with our plans to take American products off the shelves. 
- create a poll that lets people check off what American services they’ve unsubscribed from or stopped purchasing because of Trump, or find a way to get numbers on how much income larger companies have lost since the tariff threats. 

- does anyone have big pull with government or funders? We had the Covid vaccine lottery during Covid, what about a lottery you get entered in every time you support a local business

Boost morale by….
- Telling people how awesome they are when you see them buying Canadian products or if you’re a crafter, hand them a small sticker or or item to show their efforts are appreciated 
- Paying for a stranger’s coffee when they’re in line at a local coffee shop 
- waving when someone lets you into traffic. Does it help with tariffs? No. Does it brighten my day and restore a tiny bit of my faith in humanity? Yes. 
- Blast your Canadian music with the windows down when you drive around


I think some of us can do little things all together to make a difference, and if others here are better connected to undertake bigger actions, go forth, add your own ideas - big and small - below, keep calm, and tariff on!",1,1739386827.0,BuyCanadian,2,0.6,False

Dapat planned and may reservation kasi busy ako sa work—ayoko nang magtanungan pa kung saan kakain and all. Usually, nakikipag-date lang ako after work, and of course, kapag ‘nakipag-date’ ako, prospect agad na jowain.

Got tired of the dating scene kasi best foot forward lagi—parang job interview, hahaha. So I put my walls down. Fun and casual na lang. I mean, no hook-ups and momol; chill kwentuhan lang, parang catching up with a friend.

I MET A BROKE GUY (28) TOO. Sa cafe kami nag meet HAHAHAHA walang reservation and nag offer ako na bayaran yung coffee ko.

He’s fun to be with—walang dull moments. I usually offer na mag-share sa bill kasi ang hirap ng buhay ngayon. I understand kung di kaya mag-provide that much as long as di ako peperahan.

He’s a doctor, post-graduate intern sa isang public hospital, serving the people for free. I admire him for that. Tinuring ko siyang parang tropa. Normal na KKB sa mga ganap and all.

We both don’t know how it started, pero we had a gut feeling na parang this would blossom into a relationship. I prayed for it and got a confirmation. I surrendered and let him do his thing.

After a while, lagi na siyang pumupunta samin—13 kms away kami from each other. And for a ‘broke’ guy to make that kind of effort, malaking bagay na yun for me.

He may not provide that much financially, pero ibang level ang naprovide niya for my peace of mind. To cut the long story short, naging mag-jowa kami. And yung pagiging provider niya came out naturally—budgeted yung mga ganap, and kapag wala, tipid lang. :)

PS. He's the sweetest and the most gentle guy i know. Sarap mahalin. :)

PSS. Reply ko to sa ibang subreddit but i just wanna share this here na lang. Padelete na lang if bawal. Thank you!

1inynlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1inynlf/nobody_actually_likes_potatoes/,Nobody actually likes potatoes.,"This is a factual statement and I can explain it to you using basic logic.

When most people crave potatoes, the majority crave it in two different forms. They either crave mashed potatoes soaked in butter and salt and cream or they crave french fries which have been deep fried in tallow or other oil.

Even the people who go for baked potatoes will typically pour on sour cream and cheese to make it more palpable. 

I put the people who claim to like potatoes in the same category as the people who claim to like coffee but only drink the ***Mocha Choca Latta Ya Ya*** bullshit that Starbucks sells. The stuff that's 85% Milk, Syrups, Whipped Cream and 15% actual coffee.

You don't like coffee at that point. You like coffee flavored candy. Same is true of potatoes.

I could take any food from any part of the world and I can coat that food in butter, salt, cream and it would taste amazing. That's not loving food. That's loving the situation a food happens to be in.",0,1739386738.0,unpopularopinion,41,0.23,False

I've heard they can be strange"".""They are no different from anyone else, really, but the do have their quirks"".""Like what""?""Well, nearly every human I've shipped with is addicted to one or often two substances from home.   One is a leafy plant.  They chew it, or light it on fire and inhale it.  Sometimes they use a vaporizer or even transdermals.  They claim that it calms them.  I got some and ran it through the lab, the active ingredients are powerful neurotoxins.  Very strange.   The other they take in liquid form, often hot, sometimes just above the freezing point of water.  It can be taken without additives, but is often mixed with a variety of sugars and fatty liquids.  The basic liquid is a powerful stimulant.  I drank a small amount and was unable to go dormant for 6 periods.  Humans can drink large amounts with only a few side effects, but they become irritable if they do not get their dose on time.  And they are very specific about how it's prepared and delivered and what part of the cycle it is delivered in.  One human I served with had a favorite container that it drank from.  I asked about it once and got a long lecture on the proper size of container, the shape and the decoration on it and how that particular container was important to their enjoyment of imbibing the liquid.  One of my crewmates hid the container once.  The human was at first distressed, then angry, then paranoid.  It was so disruptive that we had to force the taker to ""find"" it and return it.  One dose in the proper container put everything right.  I scanned the container and kept a record of it so that I could print a new one, just in case.

Here is the thing. That stranger could be a scoundrel.

I'm building a coffee table where the top opens up with a lift hinge. When I build it, it was mitered so it just sort of drops into the main box. In theory, a router bit would handle it fine, however, because it's an unglued miter, it may chip. My measurements were a bit off and my miters aren't consistent everywhere. I think a roundover but will hide most of it. If this was a full miterbox with the lid glued down, it wouldn't be an issue, but since it's removable, the router bit might not respond well.

I'm (31F) looking for some advice as to what to do with someone who I know. I think I need to cut him off but I'm not sure how to do that. I have BPD and that's obviously making things worse, I'm going through a horrible time and yo-yoing between different personalities which is exhausting. 

This is a bit long so I apologise but I wanted to put in as much as possible. 

So for the past 4 years I feel like I have just been having crisis after crisis, and very big life changing one's, which I can't take a break from. We moved to the part of the country I'm in 5yrs ago, with my fiancé (who I have been with 8yrs now). I've never really had any consistent friends, and other than work ones I've not had a lot of other people. Due to various factors (management) at the work place I was at I ended up leaving and that's when everything went downhill, I won't go too much into detail about everything as I will be here all day. I knew I needed people in my life, and I needed something for me, so I joined a musical theatre group (4yrs ago) There I met some amazing people who I genuinely thought I would have forever (this is a consistent theme I have with every blossoming friend group) these guys were different though, they made me realise that they would actually be there for me and actually do anything for me, which is stuff I have never experienced before, I was always the one making effort and being there for others and listening to them. Anyway, one of them, Ray, and I used to talk a lot, we wouldn't meet alone but would be part of social gatherings with our friends. He was quite reserved and shy but friendly, everyone loved him, although didn't know him as well as I did. We tended to have deep meaningful conversations via messenger a lot, for the next 4 years this was kept up, we would speak fairly consistently with probably 2 weeks being the longest gap in between speaking. As well as Ray there were other friends who I would speak a lot to from that group. We were in some of the shows the group did together, and other shows we didn't do or only 1 of us did. I felt I could rely on him and talk to him about a lot, if I messaged and he didn't get back right away I'd say the longest he would go before replying would be a day with an apology. 

Anyway moving onto about 6 months ago. Ray messaged and confessed he has feelings for me and has for a long time, he knew I probably wouldn't be interested because he knew I was in a relationship. Months to this prior Ray had been saying stuff about needing to get his head straight and various things which made a lot more sense because of it. He told me when he first met me it had started. I messaged back thanking him for letting me know, that I wasn't interested in him, and hoping that by him telling me it would at least help him to move on, now he has answers. We both continued talking for a bit about how we really value our friendship and hoped that things wouldn't change. At this point we were both in a show together, so it was inevitable we would both see each other. I imagine it was just as nerve wracking for him as it was for me to see each other face-to-face, but I made the first move to show I wouldn't be awkward and things could be normal, I think from then on we both fell back into how we used to be.

Moving on, to December, I feel like my life went down the drain at this point. There was a show I wanted to do and so did he. The audition day came, and I had completely lost my voice, after talking to other people they convinced me to go anyway as they would be able to see past this (this was a singing audition) I tried my best, painstakingly squeaking the song, whilst trying to add characterisation as much as possible. I didn't get asked to call backs and didn't get in the show. This was heartbreaking for me, there was a number of reasons I needed to be in the show, but to be rejected, especially because of my singing (I've always sang, I have qualifications in singing, and have never been rejected before) was so painful, I felt so worthless, I picked myself up and decided to get the feedback to do better next time and use it as an opportunity despite dying inside from being rejected, how much I needed this group and from being embarrassed. I got told my audition was good I wasn't vocally strong enough, which I can't argue with the not being vocally strong enough as I had no voice, I fought for more feedback, without avail so ultimately I feel bitter about it, on top of that there is always speculation about favourites. Anyway, I believe my BPD/RSD/ADHD/depression/anxiety played a lot into the complete pain and devastation I felt (and still feel) 

Around Christmas time it felt like all of my friends had dropped off the face of the planet, I felt so lonely. I had a horrible Christmas and I ended up being so busy. I carried on telling myself friends weren't talking to me because they have lives outside of me, it's Christmas, of course they're not going to be glued to their phones wanting to talk to me. It was hard, as all I wanted to do was talk to people, but I knew logically. Ray was one of those people. 

January came, people slowly started reappearing and some not at all. Ray and I organised a coffee and catch up as we hadn't spoken. It was lovely, he also let me know he had found someone, I was so happy for him! I told him I had felt lonely over Christmas and how I felt that a load of people had abandoned me, he apologised about how he hadn't been talking to me, I told him it's absolutely fine, its more a ""me thing"" than a him thing, it's just it all happened when I felt down and felt it all happened at the same time, but I understand why,  its just sad some people just stopped all together. 

Time went on, Ray was barely talking to me, when he did reply it was brief, I would always be the last one left on read. It was painful, I felt like I was grieving, I felt so conflicted. On one hand I had told him how lonely and down I had been when people hadn't replied, he even seemed to acknowledge and apologise for it, I guess I downplayed it a bit when he did that but on the other he had had feelings for me, he had a gf, so probably trying to detach from me and physically seeing her more, which again I can completely understand. It hurts so bad though.

 It's something growing up happened a lot with male friends, I would have, what I considered, very close, good friendship with men, then if I got into a relationship, suddenly everyone dispersed and I'd never see them again, it was traumatic because I didn't see the situation any other way than we get along well and common interests and then they would go or they would get into a relationship and that was that. So you would think I would learn, especially since its a reoccurring theme. The only difference being I knew Ray for 4 yrs whilst being in a relationship, he hasn't completely stopped contact, but I'm not sure if this is worse. 

I got really upset when everything went pear shaped for me, who I didn't have around me was apparent. I wrote off my car, my fiancé broke up with me (we are back together now) and I was car-less, and for a while (kinda) homeless as I couldn't be in the same house as my ex because how difficult it all was. There was other things on top of that all going wrong as well but they were the main things, I also tried to end it all.

 I did the first crazy thing with Ray, I'd always talked about stupid stuff I'd done when splitting or said, but I'd never done it to him, after him not replying to me again I sent him a double message something along the lines of ""okay, I get you don't want to speak, but please let me know you're okay"" ...... admittedly that sounds relatively tame for using the word ""crazy"" but it was the most crazy I had said to him. He did message back saying he had been very busy with everything and asked how I had been. I apologised and briefly told him, he sympathised with my situation and then stopped talking.

 I now felt even worse for letting that side out, him recognising it then going back to not speaking, his mannerisms over the past weeks had been getting more clinical. I knew I had to cut myself off from him, which I did.... days went on, he messaged me and I went against that and messaged back, brief conversation, I knew he had an evening to himself -  to be left on read. We then met up last week, I had asked him for a coffee, and it was lovely, he apologised again for not being great with messages, I apologised I had been going a bit crazy, then back to being left on seen... 

I forgot to mention since December I have had a Facebook purge, I know it's not good for my mental health so I came off. This week I logged back on, because I lost someone incredibly close to me, it's broken me again when I just was starting to push forwards with life. I put a post up on Facebook, as well as the pain I'm feeling for this loss - no one has checked in to see if I'm okay. Its been a few days, I know any one of my friends I would check in, there were ""likes"" on the post, including Ray a few scattered old friends commented, which was nice, but no one messaged me.

 Kind of hits me how little I mean to people who I idolised. Thankfully I have my partner by my side, who has been amazing. 

I havent heard off Ray, and it's all making me feel crazy, was he my ""friend"" with the hope of one day just getting in my pants despite the fact I was in a relationship? What should I do? Is cutting off the right thing to do for me and my mental health - how do I do it? I know if he sends me a message I'm there for it. 

I want to make it clear even if I had been single I would not have started a relationship with Ray, and I don't have any romantic feelings for him. My BPD gets like this with people, male or female (I'm straight) where I do obsess and I do go from pure anger and wanting to be off, push them away and wanting to show them how much they're hurting me to suddenly apologising and now wanting to stay. I've already mentioned the only thing I think has been said that's bad. I don't think he's wrong at all, I think I'm the one in the wrong, I know why I'm like this, I resent the fact this is a recurring thing which I haven't identified I've always believed ""boys and girls can be friends with nothing there"" despite life showing me otherwise, I don't know why I can't believe my own reality over perceived beliefs. Through all of this, I'm trying to do ""the right thing"" as it's painful for me, and I don't want to do the wrong thing, somehow I haven't had a major split on him. 

What do I do, hit me with home truths, and how should I navigate this?

I (30/F) recently came to the realisation my dad is a narcissist.

**TLDR:** I'm looking to stand up to him and state boundaries on compulsory texting/check-ins and pretty much a 10PM curfew while on vacation at 30, and looking to resist the hellfire of guilting / rage this time. Below I've shared some context how he is, followed by my draft letter so far.

Really interested to see what you think of the letter - if I should edit parts, if it should definitely be condensed, if there's anything else I should add in to increase impact, should I send it at all? etc.

I've tried to comb over the letter with ChatGPT but it can sound robotic so I think I'd like to review this with people also. Curious to hear any other thoughts / suggestions on the situation. **Apologies this post looks quite long but I'm really hopeful to hear some of the community's thoughts as it's always so insightful.** Super appreciative of your time reading this and sending my best wishes to you as well.

It has been quite tough and upsetting to digest that my dad is a narcisisst, and reflecting on the pain I went through growing up - the blow-ups and narcissistic rage where his eyes turn feral and he gets really nasty and threatening, infantilisation, overprotective control, guilt trips, 4-hour repetitive arguments/lectures until 4AM, his absence during a lot of life milestones, somehow managing to make discussions become about himself as a victim instead, etc.

**A very quick snapshot for you to get an idea how my dad's narcissism shows up:**

\- He genuinely thinks he knows better than everyone else. 'Listen to me, ok, because Daddy is always right'.

\- At 16 when I got my first boyfriend (we had a happy 4 year relationship), he was extremely against it. He said strictly no hand-holding or contact, no kissing and if anything like sex, I'd be kicked out the house / you are not my daughter, etc. He referred to the Bible teachings a lot with this. I actually obeyed and me and my boyfriend were very slow at hand-holding / peck kissing / kissing across the ages of 16 - 20. He also said 'What's the point of any of this? They're not going to get married anyway'. We had a great relationship but chose not to continue on anyway.

\- 'Wife's name, make me a coffee. \*Wife makes coffee and turns midway to share about her aging mum's condition\*. 'Wife's name, stop, make the coffee first. Don't get distracted and talk while doing it'.

\- He was driving our family in the car somewhere. He got into some debate with me where I probably wasn't agreeing with his viewpoint completely, and ended up blowing up into rage - he was barraging insults so hard at me like 'YOU THINK YOU'RE SOOO SMART? HUH? SAY IT AGAIN? SAY IT AGAIN? FUCKING SMART ASS. YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART' etc. I ended up saying quiet for minutes at a time, crying as he continued on his monologues. When he'd shout 'HUH? HUH???' after so long, I didn't know what to do, so I'd answer 'I don't know what you want me to say!' and he'd shout 'SHUT UP!!! SHUT!!! UP!!!!'. Then I'd be quiet and it'd keep going on. My Grandma (his mother) in the back was continually begging him to stop arguing. Eventually I said 'I don't know what you want me to say!' one more time, and he smacked me in the front car seat while we were stuck in traffic, and I felt trapped so I took off the seatbelt and bolted out into the city. He and my family were yelling after me, and my mum ran out to try get me I think. Then obviously I got lectured that I was completely in the wrong, etc.

\- There was another time like this (I was maybe 18 or so) where he was suffocating me and my mum so much, she was on brink of divorcing him, and I cracked up and burst running out the house screaming in broad daylight.

\- I was in the car with him (I was maybe 27 years old), and we started talking about airplane nausea, which I suffer badly from. He claimed he believes 'there's no real such thing, it's all just in the mind', because he personally doesn't suffer from it. At the time I didn't know about not engaging with arguments with a narcissist, so I would push back slightly to try enlighten him that no, it is a thing and I personally do find it hard. He ended up seeing red, his eyes turned feral and he turned into a monster, getting really spiteful, turning the conversation into shouting something like 'NEVER COME BACK AGAIN. ALWAYS ARGUMENTATIVE, GET THE FUCK OUT. YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP, I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN', etc. I entered the house tearing up saying to my mum at the door, he's psycho man, before retreating to my room.

\- Growing up, if we got into debates, the gaslighting got so confusing sometimes that even my mum and I were looking at each other confused, because the story had become so contorted, it made me think I was crazy, forced to follow his verdict over my own, accepting I was in the wrong all the time, and that he was right. Even as a child when I tried to share that there seems to be My version of the story, His version and what likely did happen - he didn't want to acknowledge this. I remember often saying as a child 'He just always has to win', and he'd deny that was the point of it, but I can see the narcissistic signs now.

\- On a trip to Cambodia a few weeks ago (I'm 30 at this time), he heard from my mum that I use quite a lot of tissue roll in the bathroom (I'll be transparent here that I know I have actual OCD, and he does also. Regarding the tissue, I'm aware I use quite a lot but it's a personal thing I'm working through anyway). He was lecturing me over dinner tables on vacation explicitly to not use so much tissue roll, it's wasting the trees you know, etc.

On this Cambodia trip, he also would get annoyed if I was sitting resting towards the last bites of my dinner meal. He'd snap 'Are you done? You're always so slow. Hurry up, you're the last one. On this trip while you're with us you better not be like this yeah, you better eat faster and finish your food'. (It's usually when I'm socialising while eating that I might eat a bit slower, but we were on vacation and we aren't rushing anywhere, so I didn't feel it was that big a deal. I just agreed and finished up anyway).

\- On this Cambodia trip, he also lectured me to hurry up getting ready if odd times I'd be lagging a bit behind him leaving to go to the pool or things like that (I needed some pockets of time in the day to sort my make-up/hair/personal things, etc). So I made efforts to speed up, and in the end he was way later than me while I was ready at the door with my mum / eating breakfast at the restaraunt much earlier. He'd then display lovebombing / manipulation to try make himself look better when coming in late 'Oh, that's a nice shirt' (completely grey boring shirt, was quite odd).

\- I've always felt on eggshells around him, dreading when he comes home

\- He has webcams throughout the house for safety, and has been obsessing about his aging mother along with webcams also, to the point of mental breakdown and micro-managing the live-in carers there also.

\- He apparently has been put on blacklists in the creative industry he works in and is now barely getting any work, where I think many people have found him difficult to work with.

\- Minimising your feelings if you express sadness, struggle, etc. Ultimately saying to suck it up, everyone goes through things, be strong, it's small, etc.

\- He would pretty much never apologise or acknowledge his side of things after arguments, etc. It would often be 'Daddy didn't mean to get angry, just that you keep pushing / made dad angry', etc

\- Common phrases whenever I'd try to express my want to do something independently / eg. not want to text daily after moving to university, etc: 'You're such a selfish daughter. SO selfish. You think I'm proud of you? Huh? How can you even think to be like this? You really disappoint me you know. EVERYONE else does -whatever topic at hand-, why can't you.' 'After everything we've done for you'. 'You are a part of this family, and you need to play your part', etc. And when I was still under his financial support, of course he would use threats to cut me off financial support to try control, etc.

For a quick balance of context, he has his good sides where he can be a really loving dad, supportive and help provide very thorough life advice, giving me the time to talk on the phone for hours to sort through issues, etc. He has also always financially supported his family and paid for my education etc, and has said in the past he would cover costs for courses or other things that I was interested in if I wanted to pursue them, etc.

**I've come to seek thoughts and suggestions here today, because I'm looking to finally stand my ground and assert some communication boundaries with him.**

Currently he uses my mum to have her text me every 1-2 days to check that I'm alive - 'U ok?' messages, which have been going on without break since I moved out 10 years ago, at 20 years old. (Me and my mum have a better relationship where I can express myself, though she exhibits being a people-pleaser and low-key enabler at times, though she does try to vouch for me and my freedom to him a lot of times also. I have since shared all these findings and thoughts with her, so she is aware)

If I don't answer, they will begin panicking and thinking of next steps eg. calling authorities.

I have found myself remaining in a chronic state of mental hypervigilance, I constantly feel on edge, never being able to truly 'switch off' and feel fully on my own on this Earth, and it's very draining.

**2 examples where I have fallen asleep without checking my phone:**

1. In college, I woke up to the college warden knocking on my door maybe around 10PM saying my parents had asked him to check on me as they were worried something had happened. They had tried to push a tracking device / app on me as well when going to university as well, but I pushed back.
2. At work a year or so ago, I went to work like 9am, was consumed in meetings all day, came back around 5+, ate while watching a bit of YouTube or something, and crashed out until morning, where I had to quickly get ready and head out to work again, with another full day off my phone. Once I did answer, there was a barrage of panicked messages and missed calls from both of them, expressing they were worried because my Last Seen on all social media hadn't moved, and they were already thinking of next steps. They then demanded to get a number of a housemate in case they couldn't reach me, but I felt that was overextending across my boundaries as if they'd try to puppeteer my housemate to controlling / surveilling me, so I pushed back but I think in the end due to the narcissistic abuse programming and after so much arguing and guilting, I might have caved and given a number to them I think.

I have introvert tendencies and often really crave time alone to recharge. My job is also very demanding where I need to stay hypervigilant through the day as well.

What's catalysed this urge to make a change, is that - with hilarious timing, just weeks before I became educated about Narcissism and becoming enlightened that my father was one, I had just booked a full trip to go back home and see my parents.

Up to this point, aside from the drama, I actually saw my father as my 'hero', because he has worked really hard and made money that he's used to support others with - medical bills, my education, etc. He introduced God and spirituality to me, has worked very long hours and created some admirable creative work, has preached about being a good hearted person, he's spent hours talking me through my problems (eg. 4 hour conversations into the night, etc). For context if it helps, he can be a nice supportive dad. However, as many of us know, the narcissistic side can still very much exist.

So, I paid for this trip entirely myself. I paid to do a EU (where I stay) > Doha stopover for 3 days > Asia (where family stay). He said 'You can go to Doha, I'm not saying no. One condition - you pick good hotels and stick to group tours only'. Fair enough, I thought. (For context, up until now they've always assumed the role that I'll still 'ask for permission' when planning a trip, with expectation that I must run my plan by them to 'get their blessing'. Often this feels like a cloaked way of saying 'get their permission' like teenage  years, after moving out).

He said 'Once you research your itinerary (eg. tours/museums, etc), we can go through them together, okay?'. I felt it was a bit much so booked it all myself, and didn't flag it, so he let that slide.

When I was in Doha, these are the few days of annual leave I have off work to try mentally switch off and enjoy the world. At 5PM pretty much right when I got back to the hotel from my tour, he texted 'U done?'. I said yes politely. I explored the markets, and by 8.50PM he texted 'You back in the hotel?' I said no, still checking out the markets and going to get dinner. 'Wow, you haven't eaten yet? So late' sort of vibe. I went to eat around 9PM, food came at 9.20PM. He rang my phone, I told him I was literally just about to start eating, and sent a picture of the food to try make things friendly and light. He said 'Well I'll call again in 20 minutes once you're done and going back to the hotel'. I said I'm going to need more time than that - it's quite a lot of food, so probably more like an hour. He said 'Wow, that's tooo late. That is too late. No. You already got this bonus stopover trip, don't push it, we have to give and take' (But I paid for this trip myself).

I told him respectfully there was still a sea of people in the market, families regularly coming into the restaurant, it was buzzing and a safe area (Doha is apparently one of the richest and safest areas in the world), etc. He said 'I'm doing this because you're alone there, and it's late', etc.

We said bye, I ate at my own pace because I felt I wasn't going to be absurdly rushed like this, and had my phone on silent because I wanted a break from all the pinging through my time off. He miss called maybe 20 mins after the previous call, and when I messaged back after like 4 minutes, he said I made him really worried when I didn't answer.

He said to call again once I'm done and we will walk back to the hotel while on the phone together, up to my room. This restaurant was literally beside my hotel - about 10 steps door-to-door. I felt frustrated so I walked to the hotel and texted him I'm back already. He then called again (probably to check it's actually me and not some kidnapper texting him or something), to check I'm there, to go in, 'promise you're not going to go back down yeah', and to even text pictures of the room (not sure if it was just out of interest or if he was paranoid maybe I was lying and staying in a hostel or something? and I've always practiced honesty with family and in general).

Long story short, at 30 years old my dad was shepherding me into my hotel room with like a 10PM curfew. I gave in this time, but I felt frustrated like - how can I continue living happily like this with my autonomy cut off? What if I wanted to explore a bit more that evening?

We then went to Cambodia for a few days, where I managed to keep arguments at bay using the gray rock method and Mel Robbins' 'Let Them theory'. A few instances of his narcissism happened, as listed in the bullet list at the top.

I'm now staying with them at the family home in Asia, and once I return home to EU, I'll be doing a 3-day stopover in Dubai. I've been dreading he's going to do the same controlling, and I can barely take it anymore.

So I've written a message to send to him, following a lot of advice and learnings about standing your ground with narcissistic parents, which I've learned from a mix of Reddit (r/narcissisticparents, r/emotionalneglect, r/entitledparents, r/asianparentstories, etc, Mel Robbins and Dr Rahmani, Law of Attraction with Abraham Hicks, psychology articles, etc).

Each morning I wake up while on this vacation here which is supposed to be nice (I don't know when I'll be flying back again - maybe  4-5 years?), I've been feeling very down, pretty depressed and even feeling a sort of heavy heart-ache in some mornings, ruminating about this and dreading sending him this message.

**I managed to write out a draft today. It's quite long, but it felt quite hard to write in the first place. I'd like to try make it more concise, but I also feel a lot of this information is essential for him to hear. I feel there are core parts I still haven't fully expressed yet, so I'll continue to work on it.**

**Overall from hearing about this dynamic, I'd love to hear what you think - how would you suggest I tweak this message? Are there parts about it you'd change? Or if I should send it at all even? Keen to hear your thoughts, anything is really appreciated and sending my best wishes on all of your personal journeys as well. Thank you so much for reading.**

**The letter currently:**

*Hi Dad,*

*I love you, and I know you love me. I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me and you've raised me to be an independent and capable adult. Something has been weighing on me so I'm sharing across here.*

*In my generation, I've spent most my life attached to some kind of screen - computer or phones, constantly requesting your attention. In my working life, I have to overextend myself fully where I'm consistently putting others' needs before my own, I'm required to maintain constant hyperviligance to keep track of every item and ensure things don't fall through any cracks, and I'm surrounded by a lot of people and a highly overstimulating environment each day. By the end of the day and over months, there are times I feel a high need to switch off my mind completely, and reconnect with myself. I will want to turn off the phone, detach and put it in a drawer, in order to centre myself, and have time to feel grounded in the present Earth around me. I'm now 30 years old and I feel like a lot of my living has been consistently numbed through needing to stay tethered to my phone, with requests taking up mental space. I'm not often able to truly relax and feel fully present in moments as I'm never able to tap out of mental hypervigilance due to fear of missing a message or call in any hour.*

*It becomes a ticking time bomb, with fear of things escalating with your safety anxieties skyrocketing going out of check, which could lead to authorities arriving at my door. Thus, I remain in consistent hypervigilance, and it drains me. I am constantly on edge, subconsciously waiting for the other shoe to drop at any time. I feel the back of my mind must always be 'on', making it hard to even relax and spontaneously fall asleep right after a big day at work, before I have energy or wanting to tend to other peoples' requests.*

*It also isn't just about simply sending a sticker and putting my phone's sound on, because feeling coerced to routinely check in when I'm not authentically wanting to engage, just to avoid blowouts and manage your anxiety adversely builds a lot of internal resentment, and creates frustration. It doesn't allow me to have time away to miss you or organically want to share things with you from myself. It feels unpleasant and makes me even more less wanting to reply when I haven't had enough time for myself.*

*I have grown up and flown the nest yet in my adult life I don't feel there is a corner in my life for me to just 'be', for however long I may want to unplug and be offline for. This is up to every individual.*

*There are times when the mental gymnastics at work have depleted so much of my energy that I will not have bandwidth or desire to tend to others needing more from me, such as Aunty X sending 9 messages and dragging me into a live conversation, or someone routinely checking in every 2 days for anxiety alleviation that I am alive.*

*It means a lot that you care to ensure I'm safe. You have raised me well, I am 30 now and I have always looked out for myself. It has been this that has kept me safe. There is no guarantee I will have children, a family or have a partner at points in my life. I hope that you can put your confidence in me and the world around me that I will be perfectly fine without a need for you to micro-manage getting immediate replies from me, consistently survey or needing to manually shepherd me into my hotel room by 10pm.*

*As an adult, having to live like this makes me feel depressed, smothered, truly suffocated and adversely builds resentment. I have been deeply unhappy with these feelings and how things are, even before Doha, while I was still planning this trip in the EU. The feelings and dread sending you this actually coloured my whole trip to Asia. Many mornings I've woken up feeling heavy and down, some mornings even with a kind of heavy heart ache. I have been trying to be hopeful however. And I am writing this because I truly want to maintain a good relationship with you, and this is important in order for us to maintain a good relationship together.*

*I won't be doing check-ins, but will speak socially, for a more organic and authentic connection. This is important in order for us to maintain a positive relationship in the long term. I will get back to you when I can and do. There may be times I am not always available or might be busy, and that does not mean I'm consistently in trouble either. I hope you can trust that things will be fine. I hope that you will be able to give me the room to get back to you and reach out in my own time as well.*

*I know I cannot control your reactions or expectations, or to expect you might understand how it fully feels. A parent will always worry and want the best for their adult children across any age. It isn't my responsibility in life to manage your anxiety, and I hope you can find ways to help it. I am informing you of all of this because my intention is that I want to maintain a positive relationship with you. I have to take care of my mental wellbeing and sense of autonomy to ensure I have happiness in my life, and can just hope you will understand. Thank you for reading and I love you lots!*

*---*

(as a very last detail to add here in case helps for context: A few days ago, he shared to me in a kinder conversation that he wouldn't be able to support me financially if I happened to lose my job or etc. That I basically need to look out for myself etc, which I can appreciate. Perhaps this is a good sign as this may solidify the fact that I'm more financially independent from my parents also.

Reason this came up is because I was looking to travel to a neighbouring country/city to see some friends though my wider company has recently expressed they may be doing some cuts, though I received the idea I may likely not be as affected, hence how this conversation came up.) He was initially saying 'I would cancel the other trips if I were you', then reverted to saying I can decide for myself but he wouldn't cover costs if I was short etc. I managed to echo in the phrases 'Yes, so I'll decide my travels' and 'Yeah, as I'm not a child anymore', etc, where he was just nodding and speaking on)

Anyway, I imagine I sound quite preoccupied on the details / attaining 'permission' through all of this, just thought to share that in case helps with context as well. Thanks so much again for reading and if you reached this far, lol!",1,1739385880.0,Codependency,3,1.0,False

I’ve been with Soylent for a loooooong time, 1.4 2015-2016 iirc. I started drinking it in high school and quickly became a major supporter. It helped me lose a lot of weight and I have severe ibs (been tested for chrons and was inconclusive but I need to get scoped out again soon). Soylent has RARELY ever given me a negative reaction, like I didn’t even get the farts most of you complain about back then. I looooooved it and still do.

But I just bought an order of Jimmy joy few days ago and am legit excited for it to arrive. New flavors, new mixtures etc… I cannot wait.

I am nervous though that this will cause me to breakout but who knows. Jimmy joy is cheaper and I've heard it's just a better product as they're at least trying to make it flavorful instead of the gray drank we are used to.

Been using cocao powder since 2020 and it's legit been my lunch/brekky almost every day. Started on 1.4 on original back in the day.

I now doctor my soylent up with the following 


Gold standard vanilla protein powder 


Benefiber prebiotic and fiber powder 


Creatine


Pb2


Whatever else sounds good so occasionally it’ll be oat milk


heavy cream/coffee creamer (just cream, milk, vanilla, sugar and salt)


Sometimes I add fresh fruit etc…


All in all I can make huel or Jimmy joy or frankly my own diy to work. But I don’t want to, I genuinely have been a Stan of Soylent for years.


My brother and I live together and both of us drink it. My dad drinks it. I’ve gotten tons of my friends to drink it too as it’s actually really good and macro friendly.


Supply chain issues like this kill companies and kill loyal customers as they have ghosted every email l've sent. Even when I got refunds it was like pulling teeth.

I work in tech and communication is key for anything to actually survive and clearly their communication is likely half the issue here. Idc whatever bs they have going on, private equity and supply chains tho are killers of companies.

Communicate with the community, it's that easy. Just say what's going on then loyal customers like myself don't have to worry.


Hoping Jimmy joy is good cause I am almost out of Soylent for the first time in nearly a decade and I will cancel my grandfathered subscription soon if I don’t get my cocao powder and it better not have an issue or I’m done done done and they need customers like us. 


Competition is what’s best for consumers but Soylent is clearly worried about their bottom line rn and they do not care about the consumer anymore, not that they ever really did but they’ve changed since I got on this stuff a decade ago.





Lol I love how this was upvoted a bit and then the Soylent Miguel bots came in and downvoting it now. Stop stanning for a company that clearly doesn’t care about you and they bury their head in the sand when issues arise. Yall should be happy that your credit card wasn’t charged and then they didn’t ship and then wouldn’t refund you. I still have my subscription active even after that.

In 2023, I bought a 2011 Hyundai Elantra (touring) as a commuter car. I honestly love it, it’s so convenient to have a second car that gets good milage and it doesn’t matter to me if my coffee spills or it’s get dinged up on daily drives to work.

HOWEVER! I can’t stand pumping gas and that’s only going to get worse as it gets hot. If I get below ~1/4 tank, the car sputters when I turn it on. What’s really concerning is that after I fill the tank, the car does a death rattle until I can get out on the road at a continuous speed for a few minutes, and then it’s completely fine. It sucks when I have to wait for traffic or at a red light coming out of the gas station, and it has shut off before. Again, this only happens when the tank gets below 1/8-1/4. I’ve gone through several rounds of fuel Injector cleaning from autozone, no change. 

Of course the easy solution is to make sure the tank stays full, but I would like to know what’s going on with it.

Let me break down the top 5 small businesses thriving in Uganda right now (with a couple bonus mentions). Perfect for anyone curious about grassroots economies or side hustles in East Africa!  

1. Small-Scale Farming
Think family plots growing staples like matooke (plantains), beans, and coffee. Almost everyone in rural areas has a hand in this. it’s how most folks eat and make a little cash selling extras at local markets. Bonus points for backyard chicken/egg setups.  

2. Tiny Shops (Dukas)
Picture a closet-sized stall selling soap, snacks, airtime, and everything else. These are EVERYWHERE—urban corners, village roads—and often run by families. Low startup cost = ultimate side hustle.  

3. Boda-Bodas
Uganda’s motorcycle taxis are iconic. Need to dodge traffic? Carry a goat? Deliver groceries? Boda guys have you covered. It’s a youth-dominated gig, though you’ll need a bike (or rent one).  

4. Street Food Stalls
The smell of muchomo (grilled meat) or rolex (egg + chapati wrap) will hit you before you see the stalls. Cheap, fast, and always busy. Perfect for entrepreneurs who can cook and hustle in crowds.  

5. Salons & Barbershops
Every neighborhood has at least three. All you need? A chair, clippers, and some gossip skills. Bonus: braiding and wig services are HUGE.  

Honorable Mentions
Mobile Money Kiosks: These guys are the ATMs of Uganda - everyone’s cashing out or paying bills here.  

Tailors: Custom dresses, school uniforms, repairs… fabric is cheap, and demand is steady.  

Why these work?; Low startup costs, high demand, and Ugandans’ knack for improvisation. The informal economy here is wildly creative.

I am a single male who seeks one really good pen pal, preferably female, for full paragraphs of well constructed sentences. Please delve. I’m looking for more than question/answer. If you are responding through a handheld device, we are likely not a good match.



The following are a few random things about me.



1. I love coffee ☕. It's a whole ritual. I typically drink two mugs per day, but sometimes I'll have a third if the stars align.



2. In addition to noir B movies, I enjoy opera and classical music concerts. I have a wide range of tastes. I also have a nostalgic fondness for jazz.



3. I live in a desert. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. With the wide temperature swings, most days provide me at least one hour to enjoy outside. I walk daily to stay fit, and on nicer days, I sit on my porch to read in the sunshine.



4. Every Thursday I send a list of ""things for which I am grateful"" to a friend. It's a nice way to stay connected and a great way to focus on positive things. Did you know that psychologists suggest five positive things to offset one negative?

1iny3ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1iny3ib/f30_seeking_thoughts_on_letter_to_my_ndad/,(F/30) Seeking thoughts on letter to my NDad demanding routine check-ins and 10PM vacation curfew,"Hey guys,

I (30/F) recently came to the realisation my dad is a narcissist.

**TLDR:** I'm looking to stand up to him and state boundaries on compulsory texting/check-ins and pretty much a 10PM curfew while on vacation at 30, and looking to resist the hellfire of guilting / rage this time. Below I've shared some context how he is, followed by my draft letter so far.

Really interested to see what you think of the letter - if I should edit parts, if it should definitely be condensed, if there's anything else I should add in to increase impact, should I send it at all? etc.

I've tried to comb over the letter with ChatGPT but it can sound robotic so I think I'd like to review this with people also. Curious to hear any other thoughts / suggestions on the situation. **Apologies this post looks quite long but I'm really hopeful to hear some of the community's thoughts as it's always so insightful.** Super appreciative of your time reading this and sending my best wishes to you as well.

It has been quite tough and upsetting to digest that my dad is a narcisisst, and reflecting on the pain I went through growing up - the blow-ups and narcissistic rage where his eyes turn feral and he gets really nasty and threatening, infantilisation, overprotective control, guilt trips, 4-hour repetitive arguments/lectures until 4AM, his absence during a lot of life milestones, somehow managing to make discussions become about himself as a victim instead, etc.

**A very quick snapshot for you to get an idea how my dad's narcissism shows up:**

\- He genuinely thinks he knows better than everyone else. 'Listen to me, ok, because Daddy is always right'.

\- At 16 when I got my first boyfriend (we had a happy 4 year relationship), he was extremely against it. He said strictly no hand-holding or contact, no kissing and if anything like sex, I'd be kicked out the house / you are not my daughter, etc. He referred to the Bible teachings a lot with this. I actually obeyed and me and my boyfriend were very slow at hand-holding / peck kissing / kissing across the ages of 16 - 20. He also said 'What's the point of any of this? They're not going to get married anyway'. We had a great relationship but chose not to continue on anyway.

\- 'Wife's name, make me a coffee. \*Wife makes coffee and turns midway to share about her aging mum's condition\*. 'Wife's name, stop, make the coffee first. Don't get distracted and talk while doing it'.

\- He was driving our family in the car somewhere. He got into some debate with me where I probably wasn't agreeing with his viewpoint completely, and ended up blowing up into rage - he was barraging insults so hard at me like 'YOU THINK YOU'RE SOOO SMART? HUH? SAY IT AGAIN? SAY IT AGAIN? FUCKING SMART ASS. YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART' etc. I ended up saying quiet for minutes at a time, crying as he continued on his monologues. When he'd shout 'HUH? HUH???' after so long, I didn't know what to do, so I'd answer 'I don't know what you want me to say!' and he'd shout 'SHUT UP!!! SHUT!!! UP!!!!'. Then I'd be quiet and it'd keep going on. My Grandma (his mother) in the back was continually begging him to stop arguing. Eventually I said 'I don't know what you want me to say!' one more time, and he smacked me in the front car seat while we were stuck in traffic, and I felt trapped so I took off the seatbelt and bolted out into the city. He and my family were yelling after me, and my mum ran out to try get me I think. Then obviously I got lectured that I was completely in the wrong, etc.

\- There was another time like this (I was maybe 18 or so) where he was suffocating me and my mum so much, she was on brink of divorcing him, and I cracked up and burst running out the house screaming in broad daylight.

\- I was in the car with him (I was maybe 27 years old), and we started talking about airplane nausea, which I suffer badly from. He claimed he believes 'there's no real such thing, it's all just in the mind', because he personally doesn't suffer from it. At the time I didn't know about not engaging with arguments with a narcissist, so I would push back slightly to try enlighten him that no, it is a thing and I personally do find it hard. He ended up seeing red, his eyes turned feral and he turned into a monster, getting really spiteful, turning the conversation into shouting something like 'NEVER COME BACK AGAIN. ALWAYS ARGUMENTATIVE, GET THE FUCK OUT. YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP, I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN', etc. I entered the house tearing up saying to my mum at the door, he's psycho man, before retreating to my room.

\- Growing up, if we got into debates, the gaslighting got so confusing sometimes that even my mum and I were looking at each other confused, because the story had become so contorted, it made me think I was crazy, forced to follow his verdict over my own, accepting I was in the wrong all the time, and that he was right. Even as a child when I tried to share that there seems to be My version of the story, His version and what likely did happen - he didn't want to acknowledge this. I remember often saying as a child 'He just always has to win', and he'd deny that was the point of it, but I can see the narcissistic signs now.

\- On a trip to Cambodia a few weeks ago (I'm 30 at this time), he heard from my mum that I use quite a lot of tissue roll in the bathroom (I'll be transparent here that I know I have actual OCD, and he does also. Regarding the tissue, I'm aware I use quite a lot but it's a personal thing I'm working through anyway). He was lecturing me over dinner tables on vacation explicitly to not use so much tissue roll, it's wasting the trees you know, etc.

On this Cambodia trip, he also would get annoyed if I was sitting resting towards the last bites of my dinner meal. He'd snap 'Are you done? You're always so slow. Hurry up, you're the last one. On this trip while you're with us you better not be like this yeah, you better eat faster and finish your food'. (It's usually when I'm socialising while eating that I might eat a bit slower, but we were on vacation and we aren't rushing anywhere, so I didn't feel it was that big a deal. I just agreed and finished up anyway).

\- On this Cambodia trip, he also lectured me to hurry up getting ready if odd times I'd be lagging a bit behind him leaving to go to the pool or things like that (I needed some pockets of time in the day to sort my make-up/hair/personal things, etc). So I made efforts to speed up, and in the end he was way later than me while I was ready at the door with my mum / eating breakfast at the restaraunt much earlier. He'd then display lovebombing / manipulation to try make himself look better when coming in late 'Oh, that's a nice shirt' (completely grey boring shirt, was quite odd).

\- I've always felt on eggshells around him, dreading when he comes home

\- He has webcams throughout the house for safety, and has been obsessing about his aging mother along with webcams also, to the point of mental breakdown and micro-managing the live-in carers there also.

\- He apparently has been put on blacklists in the creative industry he works in and is now barely getting any work, where I think many people have found him difficult to work with.

\- Minimising your feelings if you express sadness, struggle, etc. Ultimately saying to suck it up, everyone goes through things, be strong, it's small, etc.

\- He would pretty much never apologise or acknowledge his side of things after arguments, etc. It would often be 'Daddy didn't mean to get angry, just that you keep pushing / made dad angry', etc

\- Common phrases whenever I'd try to express my want to do something independently / eg. not want to text daily after moving to university, etc: 'You're such a selfish daughter. SO selfish. You think I'm proud of you? Huh? How can you even think to be like this? You really disappoint me you know. EVERYONE else does -whatever topic at hand-, why can't you.' 'After everything we've done for you'. 'You are a part of this family, and you need to play your part', etc. And when I was still under his financial support, of course he would use threats to cut me off financial support to try control, etc.

For a quick balance of context, he has his good sides where he can be a really loving dad, supportive and help provide very thorough life advice, giving me the time to talk on the phone for hours to sort through issues, etc. He has also always financially supported his family and paid for my education etc, and has said in the past he would cover costs for courses or other things that I was interested in if I wanted to pursue them, etc.

**I've come to seek thoughts and suggestions here today, because I'm looking to finally stand my ground and assert some communication boundaries with him.**

Currently he uses my mum to have her text me every 1-2 days to check that I'm alive - 'U ok?' messages, which have been going on without break since I moved out 10 years ago, at 20 years old. (Me and my mum have a better relationship where I can express myself, though she exhibits being a people-pleaser and low-key enabler at times, though she does try to vouch for me and my freedom to him a lot of times also. I have since shared all these findings and thoughts with her, so she is aware)

If I don't answer, they will begin panicking and thinking of next steps eg. calling authorities.

I have found myself remaining in a chronic state of mental hypervigilance, I constantly feel on edge, never being able to truly 'switch off' and feel fully on my own on this Earth, and it's very draining.

**2 examples where I have fallen asleep without checking my phone:**

1. In college, I woke up to the college warden knocking on my door maybe around 10PM saying my parents had asked him to check on me as they were worried something had happened. They had tried to push a tracking device / app on me as well when going to university as well, but I pushed back.
2. At work a year or so ago, I went to work like 9am, was consumed in meetings all day, came back around 5+, ate while watching a bit of YouTube or something, and crashed out until morning, where I had to quickly get ready and head out to work again, with another full day off my phone. Once I did answer, there was a barrage of panicked messages and missed calls from both of them, expressing they were worried because my Last Seen on all social media hadn't moved, and they were already thinking of next steps. They then demanded to get a number of a housemate in case they couldn't reach me, but I felt that was overextending across my boundaries as if they'd try to puppeteer my housemate to controlling / surveilling me, so I pushed back but I think in the end due to the narcissistic abuse programming and after so much arguing and guilting, I might have caved and given a number to them I think.

I have introvert tendencies and often really crave time alone to recharge. My job is also very demanding where I need to stay hypervigilant through the day as well.

What's catalysed this urge to make a change, is that - with hilarious timing, just weeks before I became educated about Narcissism and becoming enlightened that my father was one, I had just booked a full trip to go back home and see my parents.

Up to this point, aside from the drama, I actually saw my father as my 'hero', because he has worked really hard and made money that he's used to support others with - medical bills, my education, etc. He introduced God and spirituality to me, has worked very long hours and created some admirable creative work, has preached about being a good hearted person, he's spent hours talking me through my problems (eg. 4 hour conversations into the night, etc). For context if it helps, he can be a nice supportive dad. However, as many of us know, the narcissistic side can still very much exist.

So, I paid for this trip entirely myself. I paid to do a EU (where I stay) > Doha stopover for 3 days > Asia (where family stay). He said 'You can go to Doha, I'm not saying no. One condition - you pick good hotels and stick to group tours only'. Fair enough, I thought. (For context, up until now they've always assumed the role that I'll still 'ask for permission' when planning a trip, with expectation that I must run my plan by them to 'get their blessing'. Often this feels like a cloaked way of saying 'get their permission' like teenage  years, after moving out).

He said 'Once you research your itinerary (eg. tours/museums, etc), we can go through them together, okay?'. I felt it was a bit much so booked it all myself, and didn't flag it, so he let that slide.

When I was in Doha, these are the few days of annual leave I have off work to try mentally switch off and enjoy the world. At 5PM pretty much right when I got back to the hotel from my tour, he texted 'U done?'. I said yes politely. I explored the markets, and by 8.50PM he texted 'You back in the hotel?' I said no, still checking out the markets and going to get dinner. 'Wow, you haven't eaten yet? So late' sort of vibe. I went to eat around 9PM, food came at 9.20PM. He rang my phone, I told him I was literally just about to start eating, and sent a picture of the food to try make things friendly and light. He said 'Well I'll call again in 20 minutes once you're done and going back to the hotel'. I said I'm going to need more time than that - it's quite a lot of food, so probably more like an hour. He said 'Wow, that's tooo late. That is too late. No. You already got this bonus stopover trip, don't push it, we have to give and take' (But I paid for this trip myself).

I told him respectfully there was still a sea of people in the market, families regularly coming into the restaurant, it was buzzing and a safe area (Doha is apparently one of the richest and safest areas in the world), etc. He said 'I'm doing this because you're alone there, and it's late', etc.

We said bye, I ate at my own pace because I felt I wasn't going to be absurdly rushed like this, and had my phone on silent because I wanted a break from all the pinging through my time off. He miss called maybe 20 mins after the previous call, and when I messaged back after like 4 minutes, he said I made him really worried when I didn't answer.

He said to call again once I'm done and we will walk back to the hotel while on the phone together, up to my room. This restaurant was literally beside my hotel - about 10 steps door-to-door. I felt frustrated so I walked to the hotel and texted him I'm back already. He then called again (probably to check it's actually me and not some kidnapper texting him or something), to check I'm there, to go in, 'promise you're not going to go back down yeah', and to even text pictures of the room (not sure if it was just out of interest or if he was paranoid maybe I was lying and staying in a hostel or something? and I've always practiced honesty with family and in general).

Long story short, at 30 years old my dad was shepherding me into my hotel room with like a 10PM curfew. I gave in this time, but I felt frustrated like - how can I continue living happily like this with my autonomy cut off? What if I wanted to explore a bit more that evening?

We then went to Cambodia for a few days, where I managed to keep arguments at bay using the gray rock method and Mel Robbins' 'Let Them theory'. A few instances of his narcissism happened, as listed in the bullet list at the top.

I'm now staying with them at the family home in Asia, and once I return home to EU, I'll be doing a 3-day stopover in Dubai. I've been dreading he's going to do the same controlling, and I can barely take it anymore.

So I've written a message to send to him, following a lot of advice and learnings about standing your ground with narcissistic parents, which I've learned from a mix of Reddit (r/narcissisticparents, r/emotionalneglect, r/entitledparents, r/asianparentstories, etc, Mel Robbins and Dr Rahmani, Law of Attraction with Abraham Hicks, psychology articles, etc).

Each morning I wake up while on this vacation here which is supposed to be nice (I don't know when I'll be flying back again - maybe  4-5 years?), I've been feeling very down, pretty depressed and even feeling a sort of heavy heart-ache in some mornings, ruminating about this and dreading sending him this message.

**I managed to write out a draft today. It's quite long, but it felt quite hard to write in the first place. I'd like to try make it more concise, but I also feel a lot of this information is essential for him to hear. I feel there are core parts I still haven't fully expressed yet, so I'll continue to work on it.**

**Overall from hearing about this dynamic, I'd love to hear what you think - how would you suggest I tweak this message? Are there parts about it you'd change? Or if I should send it at all even? Keen to hear your thoughts, anything is really appreciated and sending my best wishes on all of your personal journeys as well. Thank you so much for reading.**

**The letter currently:**

*Hi Dad,*

*I love you, and I know you love me. I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me and you've raised me to be an independent and capable adult. Something has been weighing on me so I'm sharing across here.*

*In my generation, I've spent most my life attached to some kind of screen - computer or phones, constantly requesting your attention. In my working life, I have to overextend myself fully where I'm consistently putting others' needs before my own, I'm required to maintain constant hyperviligance to keep track of every item and ensure things don't fall through any cracks, and I'm surrounded by a lot of people and a highly overstimulating environment each day. By the end of the day and over months, there are times I feel a high need to switch off my mind completely, and reconnect with myself. I will want to turn off the phone, detach and put it in a drawer, in order to centre myself, and have time to feel grounded in the present Earth around me. I'm now 30 years old and I feel like a lot of my living has been consistently numbed through needing to stay tethered to my phone, with requests taking up mental space. I'm not often able to truly relax and feel fully present in moments as I'm never able to tap out of mental hypervigilance due to fear of missing a message or call in any hour.*

*It becomes a ticking time bomb, with fear of things escalating with your safety anxieties skyrocketing going out of check, which could lead to authorities arriving at my door. Thus, I remain in consistent hypervigilance, and it drains me. I am constantly on edge, subconsciously waiting for the other shoe to drop at any time. I feel the back of my mind must always be 'on', making it hard to even relax and spontaneously fall asleep right after a big day at work, before I have energy or wanting to tend to other peoples' requests.*

*It also isn't just about simply sending a sticker and putting my phone's sound on, because feeling coerced to routinely check in when I'm not authentically wanting to engage, just to avoid blowouts and manage your anxiety adversely builds a lot of internal resentment, and creates frustration. It doesn't allow me to have time away to miss you or organically want to share things with you from myself. It feels unpleasant and makes me even more less wanting to reply when I haven't had enough time for myself.*

*I have grown up and flown the nest yet in my adult life I don't feel there is a corner in my life for me to just 'be', for however long I may want to unplug and be offline for. This is up to every individual.*

*There are times when the mental gymnastics at work have depleted so much of my energy that I will not have bandwidth or desire to tend to others needing more from me, such as Aunty X sending 9 messages and dragging me into a live conversation, or someone routinely checking in every 2 days for anxiety alleviation that I am alive.*

*It means a lot that you care to ensure I'm safe. You have raised me well, I am 30 now and I have always looked out for myself. It has been this that has kept me safe. There is no guarantee I will have children, a family or have a partner at points in my life. I hope that you can put your confidence in me and the world around me that I will be perfectly fine without a need for you to micro-manage getting immediate replies from me, consistently survey or needing to manually shepherd me into my hotel room by 10pm.*

*As an adult, having to live like this makes me feel depressed, smothered, truly suffocated and adversely builds resentment. I have been deeply unhappy with these feelings and how things are, even before Doha, while I was still planning this trip in the EU. The feelings and dread sending you this actually coloured my whole trip to Asia. Many mornings I've woken up feeling heavy and down, some mornings even with a kind of heavy heart ache. I have been trying to be hopeful however. And I am writing this because I truly want to maintain a good relationship with you, and this is important in order for us to maintain a good relationship together.*

*I won't be doing check-ins, but will speak socially, for a more organic and authentic connection. This is important in order for us to maintain a positive relationship in the long term. I will get back to you when I can and do. There may be times I am not always available or might be busy, and that does not mean I'm consistently in trouble either. I hope you can trust that things will be fine. I hope that you will be able to give me the room to get back to you and reach out in my own time as well.*

*I know I cannot control your reactions or expectations, or to expect you might understand how it fully feels. A parent will always worry and want the best for their adult children across any age. It isn't my responsibility in life to manage your anxiety, and I hope you can find ways to help it. I am informing you of all of this because my intention is that I want to maintain a positive relationship with you. I have to take care of my mental wellbeing and sense of autonomy to ensure I have happiness in my life, and can just hope you will understand. Thank you for reading and I love you lots!*

(as a very last detail to add here in case helps for context: A few days ago, he shared to me in a kinder conversation that he wouldn't be able to support me financially if I happened to lose my job or etc. That I basically need to look out for myself etc, which I can appreciate. Perhaps this is a good sign as this may solidify the fact that I'm more financially independent from my parents also.

Reason this came up is because I was looking to travel to a neighbouring country/city to see some friends though my wider company has recently expressed they may be doing some cuts, though I received the idea I may likely not be as affected, hence how this conversation came up.) He was initially saying 'I would cancel the other trips if I were you', then reverted to saying I can decide for myself but he wouldn't cover costs if I was short etc. I managed to echo in the phrases 'Yes, so I'll decide my travels' and 'Yeah, as I'm not a child anymore', etc, where he was just nodding and speaking on)

Anyway, I imagine I sound quite preoccupied on the details / attaining 'permission' through all of this, just thought to share that in case helps with context as well. Thanks so much again for reading and if you reached this far, lol!",1,1739385391.0,AsianParentStories,0,1.0,False

I’m an attorney and she is working as a branch manager a few floors below. We’ve been friends for around seven months, started dating a month ago. I’ve got really personal with her as friends about family life, personal traumas etc. we’ve got to really know each other in the last few months especially. 

She also has been really good at little gifts for me, she got me some lotion and boxers. She also doesn’t let me pay the bill if we get some coffee or a quick bite which i think is really cute of her also. 

I’m really unsure of what to get her. I really don’t want to get her something too much so it seems like I’m just buying her affection. I’m going to get her some nice flowers but I’m unsure of what else. Advice of any kind is appreciated, thank you! ",1,1739385370.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1iny2nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1iny2nf/torn_between_staying_in_the_us_or_returning_to/,Torn between staying in the US or returning to Europe,"Hello everyone,

about eight months ago, I left a very stable job in Switzerland to join my partner in the US after many years of LDR. We wanted to build a future together in a place where we both speak the language and maybe own a home.

However, breaking into the US job market has been a lot harder than I thought. I only get 1-2 interviews out of 100 applications. I also struggle with the way companies hire here. The timed coding tests and live pair programming sessions are really tough. I have tried to study for them, but I have had many embarrassing interviews.

Then the elections happened. We both strongly disagree with the results and the direction the country is taking. The hateful rhetoric and extreme views go against my core values.

Looking for a way out, I began applying for jobs back in Switzerland and got an overwhelmingly positive response. Following a coffee chat, one company liked me so much that they decided to create a new senior (!) position just for me. The team seems really friendly, the total comp is on par with what I would realistically earn in the US, and the benefits are amazing. Overall, it is an ideal opportunity and a safe way out.

But taking this job would mean moving back and giving up on my dream of living in the US. I worry that if I stay, with a tough tech market, ongoing layoffs, and unpredictable politics, my job search here will only get harder. At the same time, it feels like giving up at the first sign of trouble, which is hard to accept. Right now, only my partner is working, but their job is taking a toll on them because of a very toxic boss. It is very stressful, and I want to offer both of us a better way out than just providing moral support. Given this precarious situation, my SO has also revised their willingness to move abroad.

When I write this, it seems that the obvious choice is to take the opportunity back in Europe and enjoy a happy life there, with great infrastructure, reliable public transport, and an overall very high quality of life, which I do miss.

On the other hand, I love the idea of living in the US. The weather is so much nicer and people can be very friendly on a day-to-day basis. But that is often overshadowed by the constant hustle culture. I feel like there is always the need to watch your back, although I was aware of that before moving, I did not realize how much uncertainties like unpredictable medical costs and weak consumer protection would bug me.

At the end of the day, I am not sure if I should throw away all the work we put into getting the visas set up and move back. We started this journey when none of these issues were clear, and now the reality has become much tougher. I have a way out, but I still feel uncertain about taking it because it somehow feels like giving up. I feel like the 'American Dream' isn't working out right now. I have a couple of friends who moved to the US several years ago, who made it big here by now, and I always envied them.

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Moved to the US to be with my partner, but breaking into the job market has been much harder than expected. Just got a potential senior job offer back in Europe with great pay and benefits. Struggling to decide if we should stay or go back.",5,1739385330.0,TrueOffMyChest,9,1.0,False

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

1iny1qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1iny1qv/how_do_i_go_about_designing_a_sustainable_coffee/,How do I go about designing a sustainable coffee bag for my senior design exhibition?,"I am in the middle of creating a coffee brand identity and recently found myself stuck. My coffee company is based around sustainability, so when it comes to my packaging I thought to try kraft paper. I have my designs ready to be printed.. but I don’t know where to go. Every website that sells coffee bags have a minimum of 300-1,000 bags and I’m looking to showcase 3 different designed bags. I have a circuit as well, but every dimension guide I’m finding is bigger than what my cricuit can cut.. and to be honest I haven’t used it much so I don’t know a whole lot about what that process would look like. Another thing I have thought of is buying labels to put on non-designed kraft paper coffee pouches. Yet again, I’m worried about the necessary bulk order. So now i’m giving Reddit a shot and fingers crossed someone else can help!",1,1739385272.0,graphic_design,2,1.0,False
1iny1pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1iny1pf/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 12/02/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

1iny1dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iny1dd/need_advice_friendship_becoming_too_much/,Need advice - friendship becoming too much,"Hey all,

Not sure what to do about this situation and could use some advice.

I became friends with a girl who worked at the same company as me (different location). We bonded over how badly we were treated at work (many people were and ended up quitting, causing the company some trouble) and both left around the same time. We’d message occasionally and met up a few times, but nothing intense.

At some point, we started texting more. My new company needed a temp, so I reached out to her—big mistake. She was embarrassing to work with: frequently crying at work, making a fuss over nothing, and constantly inserting herself into conversations, even when it was about work and had nothing to do with her. She’d talk to me non-stop at work, then text me the second she left, first thing in the morning, and send endless voice notes. I tried to be polite but kept my replies vague to create distance.

On top of that, she made everything about herself, her mental health, and her nationality (American—we’re in Europe). It’s really hard to have a conversation that doesn’t revolve around her. I struggle with my own mental health, so dealing with someone who constantly dumped their issues on me was overwhelming. She also started buying me coffee daily (refusing to accept money), getting me books, and giving me little gifts, which made me feel obligated to reciprocate—even though I couldn’t afford to.

Once her contract ended, I distanced myself. A month later, I reached out and explained that her constant messaging was overwhelming (20+ unread messages a day!). She agreed to tone it down, and things calmed for a bit—until December, when she had drama with her roommate (who I also know). I wanted nothing to do with it, told them both they were being petty, and shut it down.

Now she’s back to relentlessly contacting me. If I don’t reply on WhatsApp, she moves to Instagram, then Facebook, then TikTok—it’s like I can’t go online without seeing a message from her. Recently, I posted in a local girls’ group about starting a book club, and she inserted herself into that too, dominated the conversation, and even made some backhanded comments about me in front of everyone. She’s also made some uncomfortable comments about my partner, like saying he’s hot and her type, which I really don’t appreciate.

There’s so much more I could say, but I don’t want to write an essay. I don’t want to be horrible, but this is way too much. How do I handle this without causing unnecessary drama?

My dx includes schizophrenia and peripheral neuropathy. No dx about heart problems etc. The medications I take are invega, Wellbutrin, benztropine, hydroxyzine, and gabapentin.

I just had a blood test and the troponin t flagged as high. It was 35 ng/l . The last time I had this tested was about two years ago. That test showed only 
9 ng/l.

Nothing has happened to my heart since then. Haven't noticed chest pain or anything, and I've also had normal ekgs since then.

The only thing i can think of is that I had a lot of coffee before the test. I drank about 3 cups in less than an hour.I didn't think it would interfere.

I read somewhere that fast heart rate can cause high troponin t. The caffeine definitely was making my heartbeat faster. Is it possible that the caffeine interfered with the blood test and and caused a false elevation in troponin t ?

Just wanted to say that I highly recommend using your warranty to upgrade to the E24 (i.e. you'd pay the difference in cost) because it will almost definitely solve your boiler flaking issues. It sure solved mine, and the difference is night and day. 

I FINALLY have flake-free water coming out of my steam wand and it's stayed that way for the entire time I've had my E24. 

**What they might tell you when you ask for a warranty replacement because of flakes**

* They may tell you it's your water filter - but if you don't even use a water filter because your tap water is perfect - it's clearly NOT the non-existent water filter. The Evo Pro boiler is flaking. 
* They may tell you it's mineral buildup - but mineral buildup looks like white'ish crystals - if you're seeing dark grey teflon-like flakes, it's the wrong color and shape to be mineral buildup. The Evo Pro boiler is flaking. 
* They may tell you it's ground coffee - but ground coffee is brown, not dark grey - and it's impossible for ground coffee to come out of the steam wand. The Evo Pro boiler is flaking. 
* They may tell you the warranty replacement they gave you previously had a (surprise!) uncoated boiler that they just didn't tell you about at the time - but if your machine is spitting out Teflon-like flakes, I think it's highly unlikely you have an uncoated boiler. The Evo Pro boiler is flaking. 

**My warranty replacement**

So, a while back I asked for my SECOND warranty replacement because not only did my original Evo Pro have flakes, but so did my warranty replacement. Support told me my warranty replacement couldn't possibly have flakes because based on the serial number, they put an uncoated aluminum boiler inside that machine - that seemed odd to me because I didn't request an exposed aluminum boiler AND the machine still spit out flakes that looked the same color as the non-stick coating on the original Evo Pro.

So I insisted on an E24 (i.e. I'd pay the difference in cost). My E24 is an amazing machine and now I FINALLY have the Gaggia I've always wanted: NO FLAKES!!! :)

**How do you know for sure that you have boiler flakes:**

Before you make any espresso that day, put a clear measuring cup under the steam wand and add water. Now put that measuring cup on a folded white paper towel, then look at what's in there under bright white light. If you have trouble seeing tiny things, take a photo and zoom in to see flakes - you may also see tiny bits of dark grey-colored dust (i.e. the same color as Teflon).

**Boiler flakes vs. mineral buildup**

Boiler flakes: they're the color of typical non-stick coatings you see on non-stick frying pans - dark grey - and they are flat flakes that often have jagged irregular edges

* in my experience, these flakes were present as tiny specks (they looked like dark grey dust) from Day 1, and continued over time, eventually appearing as flakes too

Mineral build up: this is more of a white'ish color and appear as crystals, not flakes - it looks completely different from the flaking dark grey non-stick coating.

* in my experience, these are NOT present on Day 1, but begin to appear as you get closer and closer to the time when you're due to descale the machine... then you descale, and the white'ish

You've become increasingly familiar with aspects of Masonese grammar, including verbs and numbers, times and dates. Now, let's begin to engage with day-to-day Masonese that you would need, beginning with a trip to the café. We'll introduce some vocab, go over how to ask questions, and watch Nyo order something from the coffee shop.

*U buaem malaesh valothi veg hiepsi sul legina demasiebaski, kthāgra navi og tond, msao og kalishet. Thua, alo kain naba veg masiebaski devestra ath u ve nin, kaiagra veg voye or ejulyet. O sas syrin esos vaiva, prajo hūa nepaish tsema, og vat Nyo sa paishe sitra po emagar sul juli.*

Vocab:

* Coffee = juli
* Black coffee = juli denan/demelēna
* White coffee = juli deblanth/dalēblanth
* Latte = juli devaksara
* Tea = khai
* Green tea = khai devera/devolovera
* Milk = vaksa
* Sugar = her
* Cup = daor
* Take-away = guatage
* Sit-in = psuatsure
* Pastry = elhani
* Hot = khua
* Warm = ansa
* Cool = edha
* Cold = thu
* Iced = entsa/veg entos

(Comment below if you'd like any more vocab!)

So, how do we ask **questions** in Masonese?

*Tsoy, ts'o paish tsema hūa da masiebaski?*

To ask a question in Masonese, we do not change the structure of a sentence at all. All we do is add the participle *tsem*, regularly shortened to *ts'*, to the start of the sentence:

* You are going to the shop = u nejo ro emagar
* Are you going to the shop? = ts'u nejo ro emagar?
* I can get you what \~
* What can I get you = ts'a per akun u dūa?

Simply put, create a normally sentence and then add the participle, that is all. Here's some question words to help you out, of course they normally go right at the end of the sentence:

* What = dūa
* Where = lūa
* Why = psūa
* When = ksūa
* Which = kthūa
* Who = thūa (often at the start, replacing a subject pronoun)
* Whose = msūa
* How = hūa
* How many/much = mesk
* How long = vili

Let's see Nyo order from the café:

It gets so bad she will say something and I will tell her you shouldn’t say that to someone that’s rude, to which she replies oh but I didn’t say that… lost for words, really. 

Ridiculously entitled, everything has been handed to her and even though she studied years and is working in her dream job somehow this person is never happy and never satisfied. 

2 years ago I sold my apartment invested a buttload of money into a business so she could continue working in her field independently (little more then 40k USD). 2 years later and I’m pathetic and unemployed. Her business is slowly going downhill since I stopped being a part of it because it’s extremely difficult to communicate or get anything done with her. Now even police have come to pick her up from our house for salary fraud investigation. 

Not a single thank you just more lies. 

I’m exhausted.. Im leaving it all behind and starting my own thing from scratch. 

I can’t wait to leave…

1inxprw,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1inxprw/f30_seeking_thoughts_on_letter_to_my_ndad/,(F/30) Seeking thoughts on letter to my NDad demanding routine check-ins and 10PM vacation curfew,"Hey guys,

I (30/F) recently came to the realisation my dad is a narcissist.

**TLDR:** I'm looking to stand up to him and state boundaries on compulsory texting/check-ins and pretty much a 10PM curfew while on vacation at 30, and looking to resist the hellfire of guilting / rage this time. Below I've shared some context how he is, followed by my draft letter so far.

Really interested to see what you think of the letter - if I should edit parts, if it should definitely be condensed, if there's anything else I should add in to increase impact, should I send it at all? etc.

I've tried to comb over the letter with ChatGPT but it can sound robotic so I think I'd like to review this with people also. Curious to hear any other thoughts / suggestions on the situation. **Apologies this post looks quite long but I'm really hopeful to hear some of the community's thoughts as it's always so insightful.** Super appreciative of your time reading this and sending my best wishes to you as well.

It has been quite tough and upsetting to digest that my dad is a narcisisst, and reflecting on the pain I went through growing up - the blow-ups and narcissistic rage where his eyes turn feral and he gets really nasty and threatening, infantilisation, overprotective control, guilt trips, 4-hour repetitive arguments/lectures until 4AM, his absence during a lot of life milestones, somehow managing to make discussions become about himself as a victim instead, etc.

**A very quick snapshot for you to get an idea how my dad's narcissism shows up:**

\- He genuinely thinks he knows better than everyone else. 'Listen to me, ok, because Daddy is always right'.

\- At 16 when I got my first boyfriend (we had a happy 4 year relationship), he was extremely against it. He said strictly no hand-holding or contact, no kissing and if anything like sex, I'd be kicked out the house / you are not my daughter, etc. He referred to the Bible teachings a lot with this. I actually obeyed and me and my boyfriend were very slow at hand-holding / peck kissing / kissing across the ages of 16 - 20. He also said 'What's the point of any of this? They're not going to get married anyway'. We had a great relationship but chose not to continue on anyway.

\- 'Wife's name, make me a coffee. \*Wife makes coffee and turns midway to share about her aging mum's condition\*. 'Wife's name, stop, make the coffee first. Don't get distracted and talk while doing it'.

\- He was driving our family in the car somewhere. He got into some debate with me where I probably wasn't agreeing with his viewpoint completely, and ended up blowing up into rage - he was barraging insults so hard at me like 'YOU THINK YOU'RE SOOO SMART? HUH? SAY IT AGAIN? SAY IT AGAIN? FUCKING SMART ASS. YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART' etc. I ended up saying quiet for minutes at a time, crying as he continued on his monologues. When he'd shout 'HUH? HUH???' after so long, I didn't know what to do, so I'd answer 'I don't know what you want me to say!' and he'd shout 'SHUT UP!!! SHUT!!! UP!!!!'. Then I'd be quiet and it'd keep going on. My Grandma (his mother) in the back was continually begging him to stop arguing. Eventually I said 'I don't know what you want me to say!' one more time, and he smacked me in the front car seat while we were stuck in traffic, and I felt trapped so I took off the seatbelt and bolted out into the city. He and my family were yelling after me, and my mum ran out to try get me I think. Then obviously I got lectured that I was completely in the wrong, etc.

\- There was another time like this (I was maybe 18 or so) where he was suffocating me and my mum so much, she was on brink of divorcing him, and I cracked up and burst running out the house screaming in broad daylight.

\- I was in the car with him (I was maybe 27 years old), and we started talking about airplane nausea, which I suffer badly from. He claimed he believes 'there's no real such thing, it's all just in the mind', because he personally doesn't suffer from it. At the time I didn't know about not engaging with arguments with a narcissist, so I would push back slightly to try enlighten him that no, it is a thing and I personally do find it hard. He ended up seeing red, his eyes turned feral and he turned into a monster, getting really spiteful, turning the conversation into shouting something like 'NEVER COME BACK AGAIN. ALWAYS ARGUMENTATIVE, GET THE FUCK OUT. YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP, I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN', etc. I entered the house tearing up saying to my mum at the door, he's psycho man, before retreating to my room.

\- Growing up, if we got into debates, the gaslighting got so confusing sometimes that even my mum and I were looking at each other confused, because the story had become so contorted, it made me think I was crazy, forced to follow his verdict over my own, accepting I was in the wrong all the time, and that he was right. Even as a child when I tried to share that there seems to be My version of the story, His version and what likely did happen - he didn't want to acknowledge this. I remember often saying as a child 'He just always has to win', and he'd deny that was the point of it, but I can see the narcissistic signs now.

\- On a trip to Cambodia a few weeks ago (I'm 30 at this time), he heard from my mum that I use quite a lot of tissue roll in the bathroom (I'll be transparent here that I know I have actual OCD, and he does also. Regarding the tissue, I'm aware I use quite a lot but it's a personal thing I'm working through anyway). He was lecturing me over dinner tables on vacation explicitly to not use so much tissue roll, it's wasting the trees you know, etc.

On this Cambodia trip, he also would get annoyed if I was sitting resting towards the last bites of my dinner meal. He'd snap 'Are you done? You're always so slow. Hurry up, you're the last one. On this trip while you're with us you better not be like this yeah, you better eat faster and finish your food'. (It's usually when I'm socialising while eating that I might eat a bit slower, but we were on vacation and we aren't rushing anywhere, so I didn't feel it was that big a deal. I just agreed and finished up anyway).

\- On this Cambodia trip, he also lectured me to hurry up getting ready if odd times I'd be lagging a bit behind him leaving to go to the pool or things like that (I needed some pockets of time in the day to sort my make-up/hair/personal things, etc). So I made efforts to speed up, and in the end he was way later than me while I was ready at the door with my mum / eating breakfast at the restaraunt much earlier. He'd then display lovebombing / manipulation to try make himself look better when coming in late 'Oh, that's a nice shirt' (completely grey boring shirt, was quite odd).

\- I've always felt on eggshells around him, dreading when he comes home

\- He has webcams throughout the house for safety, and has been obsessing about his aging mother along with webcams also, to the point of mental breakdown and micro-managing the live-in carers there also.

\- He apparently has been put on blacklists in the creative industry he works in and is now barely getting any work, where I think many people have found him difficult to work with.

\- Minimising your feelings if you express sadness, struggle, etc. Ultimately saying to suck it up, everyone goes through things, be strong, it's small, etc.

\- He would pretty much never apologise or acknowledge his side of things after arguments, etc. It would often be 'Daddy didn't mean to get angry, just that you keep pushing / made dad angry', etc

\- Common phrases whenever I'd try to express my want to do something independently / eg. not want to text daily after moving to university, etc: 'You're such a selfish daughter. SO selfish. You think I'm proud of you? Huh? How can you even think to be like this? You really disappoint me you know. EVERYONE else does -whatever topic at hand-, why can't you.' 'After everything we've done for you'. 'You are a part of this family, and you need to play your part', etc. And when I was still under his financial support, of course he would use threats to cut me off financial support to try control, etc.

For a quick balance of context, he has his good sides where he can be a really loving dad, supportive and help provide very thorough life advice, giving me the time to talk on the phone for hours to sort through issues, etc. He has also always financially supported his family and paid for my education etc, and has said in the past he would cover costs for courses or other things that I was interested in if I wanted to pursue them, etc.

**I've come to seek thoughts and suggestions here today, because I'm looking to finally stand my ground and assert some communication boundaries with him.**

Currently he uses my mum to have her text me every 1-2 days to check that I'm alive - 'U ok?' messages, which have been going on without break since I moved out 10 years ago, at 20 years old. (Me and my mum have a better relationship where I can express myself, though she exhibits being a people-pleaser and low-key enabler at times, though she does try to vouch for me and my freedom to him a lot of times also. I have since shared all these findings and thoughts with her, so she is aware)

If I don't answer, they will begin panicking and thinking of next steps eg. calling authorities.

I have found myself remaining in a chronic state of mental hypervigilance, I constantly feel on edge, never being able to truly 'switch off' and feel fully on my own on this Earth, and it's very draining.

**2 examples where I have fallen asleep without checking my phone:**

1. In college, I woke up to the college warden knocking on my door maybe around 10PM saying my parents had asked him to check on me as they were worried something had happened. They had tried to push a tracking device / app on me as well when going to university as well, but I pushed back.
2. At work a year or so ago, I went to work like 9am, was consumed in meetings all day, came back around 5+, ate while watching a bit of YouTube or something, and crashed out until morning, where I had to quickly get ready and head out to work again, with another full day off my phone. Once I did answer, there was a barrage of panicked messages and missed calls from both of them, expressing they were worried because my Last Seen on all social media hadn't moved, and they were already thinking of next steps. They then demanded to get a number of a housemate in case they couldn't reach me, but I felt that was overextending across my boundaries as if they'd try to puppeteer my housemate to controlling / surveilling me, so I pushed back but I think in the end due to the narcissistic abuse programming and after so much arguing and guilting, I might have caved and given a number to them I think.

I have introvert tendencies and often really crave time alone to recharge. My job is also very demanding where I need to stay hypervigilant through the day as well.

What's catalysed this urge to make a change, is that - with hilarious timing, just weeks before I became educated about Narcissism and becoming enlightened that my father was one, I had just booked a full trip to go back home and see my parents.

Up to this point, aside from the drama, I actually saw my father as my 'hero', because he has worked really hard and made money that he's used to support others with - medical bills, my education, etc. He introduced God and spirituality to me, has worked very long hours and created some admirable creative work, has preached about being a good hearted person, he's spent hours talking me through my problems (eg. 4 hour conversations into the night, etc). For context if it helps, he can be a nice supportive dad. However, as many of us know, the narcissistic side can still very much exist.

So, I paid for this trip entirely myself. I paid to do a EU (where I stay) > Doha stopover for 3 days > Asia (where family stay). He said 'You can go to Doha, I'm not saying no. One condition - you pick good hotels and stick to group tours only'. Fair enough, I thought. (For context, up until now they've always assumed the role that I'll still 'ask for permission' when planning a trip, with expectation that I must run my plan by them to 'get their blessing'. Often this feels like a cloaked way of saying 'get their permission' like teenage  years, after moving out).

He said 'Once you research your itinerary (eg. tours/museums, etc), we can go through them together, okay?'. I felt it was a bit much so booked it all myself, and didn't flag it, so he let that slide.

When I was in Doha, these are the few days of annual leave I have off work to try mentally switch off and enjoy the world. At 5PM pretty much right when I got back to the hotel from my tour, he texted 'U done?'. I said yes politely. I explored the markets, and by 8.50PM he texted 'You back in the hotel?' I said no, still checking out the markets and going to get dinner. 'Wow, you haven't eaten yet? So late' sort of vibe. I went to eat around 9PM, food came at 9.20PM. He rang my phone, I told him I was literally just about to start eating, and sent a picture of the food to try make things friendly and light. He said 'Well I'll call again in 20 minutes once you're done and going back to the hotel'. I said I'm going to need more time than that - it's quite a lot of food, so probably more like an hour. He said 'Wow, that's tooo late. That is too late. No. You already got this bonus stopover trip, don't push it, we have to give and take' (But I paid for this trip myself).

I told him respectfully there was still a sea of people in the market, families regularly coming into the restaurant, it was buzzing and a safe area (Doha is apparently one of the richest and safest areas in the world), etc. He said 'I'm doing this because you're alone there, and it's late', etc.

We said bye, I ate at my own pace because I felt I wasn't going to be absurdly rushed like this, and had my phone on silent because I wanted a break from all the pinging through my time off. He miss called maybe 20 mins after the previous call, and when I messaged back after like 4 minutes, he said I made him really worried when I didn't answer.

He said to call again once I'm done and we will walk back to the hotel while on the phone together, up to my room. This restaurant was literally beside my hotel - about 10 steps door-to-door. I felt frustrated so I walked to the hotel and texted him I'm back already. He then called again (probably to check it's actually me and not some kidnapper texting him or something), to check I'm there, to go in, 'promise you're not going to go back down yeah', and to even text pictures of the room (not sure if it was just out of interest or if he was paranoid maybe I was lying and staying in a hostel or something? and I've always practiced honesty with family and in general).

Long story short, at 30 years old my dad was shepherding me into my hotel room with like a 10PM curfew. I gave in this time, but I felt frustrated like - how can I continue living happily like this with my autonomy cut off? What if I wanted to explore a bit more that evening?

We then went to Cambodia for a few days, where I managed to keep arguments at bay using the gray rock method and Mel Robbins' 'Let Them theory'. A few instances of his narcissism happened, as listed in the bullet list at the top.

I'm now staying with them at the family home in Asia, and once I return home to EU, I'll be doing a 3-day stopover in Dubai. I've been dreading he's going to do the same controlling, and I can barely take it anymore.

So I've written a message to send to him, following a lot of advice and learnings about standing your ground with narcissistic parents, which I've learned from a mix of Reddit (r/narcissisticparents, r/emotionalneglect, r/entitledparents, r/asianparentstories, etc, Mel Robbins and Dr Rahmani, Law of Attraction with Abraham Hicks, psychology articles, etc).

Each morning I wake up while on this vacation here which is supposed to be nice (I don't know when I'll be flying back again - maybe  4-5 years?), I've been feeling very down, pretty depressed and even feeling a sort of heavy heart-ache in some mornings, ruminating about this and dreading sending him this message.

**I managed to write out a draft today. It's quite long, but it felt quite hard to write in the first place. I'd like to try make it more concise, but I also feel a lot of this information is essential for him to hear. I feel there are core parts I still haven't fully expressed yet, so I'll continue to work on it.**

**Overall from hearing about this dynamic, I'd love to hear what you think - how would you suggest I tweak this message? Are there parts about it you'd change? Or if I should send it at all even? Keen to hear your thoughts, anything is really appreciated and sending my best wishes on all of your personal journeys as well. Thank you so much for reading.**

**The letter currently:**

*Hi Dad,*

*I love you, and I know you love me. I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me and you've raised me to be an independent and capable adult. Something has been weighing on me so I'm sharing across here.*

*In my generation, I've spent most my life attached to some kind of screen - computer or phones, constantly requesting your attention. In my working life, I have to overextend myself fully where I'm consistently putting others' needs before my own, I'm required to maintain constant hyperviligance to keep track of every item and ensure things don't fall through any cracks, and I'm surrounded by a lot of people and a highly overstimulating environment each day. By the end of the day and over months, there are times I feel a high need to switch off my mind completely, and reconnect with myself. I will want to turn off the phone, detach and put it in a drawer, in order to centre myself, and have time to feel grounded in the present Earth around me. I'm now 30 years old and I feel like a lot of my living has been consistently numbed through needing to stay tethered to my phone, with requests taking up mental space. I'm not often able to truly relax and feel fully present in moments as I'm never able to tap out of mental hypervigilance due to fear of missing a message or call in any hour.*

*It becomes a ticking time bomb, with fear of things escalating with your safety anxieties skyrocketing going out of check, which could lead to authorities arriving at my door. Thus, I remain in consistent hypervigilance, and it drains me. I am constantly on edge, subconsciously waiting for the other shoe to drop at any time. I feel the back of my mind must always be 'on', making it hard to even relax and spontaneously fall asleep right after a big day at work, before I have energy or wanting to tend to other peoples' requests.*

*It also isn't just about simply sending a sticker and putting my phone's sound on, because feeling coerced to routinely check in when I'm not authentically wanting to engage, just to avoid blowouts and manage your anxiety adversely builds a lot of internal resentment, and creates frustration. It doesn't allow me to have time away to miss you or organically want to share things with you from myself. It feels unpleasant and makes me even more less wanting to reply when I haven't had enough time for myself.*

*I have grown up and flown the nest yet in my adult life I don't feel there is a corner in my life for me to just 'be', for however long I may want to unplug and be offline for. This is up to every individual.*

*There are times when the mental gymnastics at work have depleted so much of my energy that I will not have bandwidth or desire to tend to others needing more from me, such as Aunty X sending 9 messages and dragging me into a live conversation, or someone routinely checking in every 2 days for anxiety alleviation that I am alive.*

*It means a lot that you care to ensure I'm safe. You have raised me well, I am 30 now and I have always looked out for myself. It has been this that has kept me safe. There is no guarantee I will have children, a family or have a partner at points in my life. I hope that you can put your confidence in me and the world around me that I will be perfectly fine without a need for you to micro-manage getting immediate replies from me, consistently survey or needing to manually shepherd me into my hotel room by 10pm.*

*As an adult, having to live like this makes me feel depressed, smothered, truly suffocated and adversely builds resentment. I have been deeply unhappy with these feelings and how things are, even before Doha, while I was still planning this trip in the EU. The feelings and dread sending you this actually coloured my whole trip to Asia. Many mornings I've woken up feeling heavy and down, some mornings even with a kind of heavy heart ache. I have been trying to be hopeful however. And I am writing this because I truly want to maintain a good relationship with you, and this is important in order for us to maintain a good relationship together.*

*I won't be doing check-ins, but will speak socially, for a more organic and authentic connection. This is important in order for us to maintain a positive relationship in the long term. I will get back to you when I can and do. There may be times I am not always available or might be busy, and that does not mean I'm consistently in trouble either. I hope you can trust that things will be fine. I hope that you will be able to give me the room to get back to you and reach out in my own time as well.*

*I know I cannot control your reactions or expectations, or to expect you might understand how it fully feels. A parent will always worry and want the best for their adult children across any age. It isn't my responsibility in life to manage your anxiety, and I hope you can find ways to help it. I am informing you of all of this because my intention is that I want to maintain a positive relationship with you. I have to take care of my mental wellbeing and sense of autonomy to ensure I have happiness in my life, and can just hope you will understand. Thank you for reading and I love you lots!*

*---*

(as a very last detail to add here in case helps for context: A few days ago, he shared to me in a kinder conversation that he wouldn't be able to support me financially if I happened to lose my job or etc. That I basically need to look out for myself etc, which I can appreciate. Perhaps this is a good sign as this may solidify the fact that I'm more financially independent from my parents also.

Reason this came up is because I was looking to travel to a neighbouring country/city to see some friends though my wider company has recently expressed they may be doing some cuts, though I received the idea I may likely not be as affected, hence how this conversation came up.) He was initially saying 'I would cancel the other trips if I were you', then reverted to saying I can decide for myself but he wouldn't cover costs if I was short etc. I managed to echo in the phrases 'Yes, so I'll decide my travels' and 'Yeah, as I'm not a child anymore', etc, where he was just nodding and speaking on)

Anyway, I imagine I sound quite preoccupied on the details / attaining 'permission' through all of this, just thought to share that in case helps with context as well. Thanks so much again for reading and if you reached this far, lol!",1,1739384466.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

Given the problem with slash (wood left over after clearing out good logs in forestry) is there an obvious solution here?  Use slash for source for bio pellets to have a renewable solution for Huntly?

Does anyone here know if this would work or could be a viable option?  Presumably slash could be chipped on site and then taken to a bio pellets plant for prep?

Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! ) 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

From my own research, I am leaning towards the giant TCR, giant Propel, Cannondale SuperSix, or Cannondale Synapse. I like the idea of the speed the propel can offer, especially when it comes to race time, but find a lot of people against it due to stiffness and more aggressive riding position. The TCR seems to be the fan favorite. Any thoughts from people who have ridden any of these? Any advice as well as this will be my first road bike for serious training.

Last week this girl, let’s call her “Y” spilled her coffee on my coat right before the start of class. The professor’s pretty strict about class start time and I was only able to react for a few seconds before we had to settle in for class. In the moment Y said a basic “I’m sorry, spilled coffee on your coat” and me being the type of person I am said it’s okay accidents happen but after class ended and taking a better look a LOT had spilled on my coat and I had to spend $60 to take it to the dry cleaners to get out all the stains. I know I made a mistake in the moment when I said it was okay because I was too flustered and never been in that situation before.

I found her in our class’ WhatsApp and messaged her privately that I understood it was an accident but after checking my coat she spilled a lot and I did have to get it dry cleaned and asked if she could contribute to some of it since it was her fault. She initially ignored my message for a few days despite being active on WhatsApp all the time and then sent me a defensive response, calling me rude for asking for money and that instead she’s willing to offer me coffee.

I found that really offensive, especially to offer coffee when she spilled COFFEE on my coat and she took no accountability for her actions. I know money isn’t an issue for Y because she’s always wearing flashy branded clothes and they are an international student attending this grad school (I got in through a special tuition program).

She has a 1.5 year old little boy, two cats and a dog, for reference. ",3,1739384050.0,AskParents,5,1.0,False

Plumbing work contracted out to move w/d hookup to other side of wall. Everything else done by my {amazing and patient} husband, learning on the fly. I contributed the vision and ~20% labor.
Good finds on marketplace (upper cabinets, white round table, mini cooler), and ikea (open shelf cabinets and hooks, butcher block countertop). About 6 months work. Total cost spent about 1-1.5k not including plumbing cost (give or take with materials, we weren’t too concerned since the project took so long and we were doing it on our own).
