For context, after we had been together for a month we both had an extended period of time of unemployment where he was supporting me financially and emotionally during my search for a new job.  He wasn't looking very dedicatedly at the time, because the company he worked for previously handled the situation of letting him go through a contract that essentially made it so he couldn't start working until the beginning of October (very messed up situation and a completely different story).

I have found several jobs in the meantime that would take me and am currently employed for the second time. We were also staying at his house during our shared phase of unemployment and I did stay there even while I had a job for some time until it became too much. I drove 1 hour at my first job since we were together and 2 hours every day at my current job, we live 1 hour apart and I have an apartment 5 minutes away from my work place. Unfortunately my apartment isn't viable to live in with 2 people and he also has a cat to take care of.

He still is not employed and I personally am very unhappy with this for two reasons:

1 - He still wants to financially support me (he does have money and his parents also give him money, but it feels wrong). I did initially need some help to pay for rent and groceries while unemployed, because I didn't earn enough to fully support myself on unemployment.

2 - He is very unhappy if not depressed and relies on me staying positive and pushing him to take care of himself (examples being: seeing a a doctor, taking care of his car, going out with friends/generally going outside to just not stay in his home all the time, doing things he enjoys or used to enjoy).

He has been unemployed for 5 months now and has started to apply ""properly"" roughly 2 months ago. I suggested to him to help him with his applications, because they seem to get nowhere and he got rejected without even being invited to interviews. Initially, I sent him job offers and gave him suggestions on where to apply. Then I realised he wasn't even giving them a whole application (cover letter, CV, proof performance/certificates), he only sent his CV so therefore he would get rejected repeatedly. I talked about it with him and eventually he came up with a very generic cover letter. Obviously, this day and age HR uses filters for keywords so that also wasn't going anywhere. He seems absolutely oblivious to how to even apply for jobs and I have trouble sympathising with him after this has been going on for a this long.

He keeps saying he wants to find a well paying job so we can have a family and move in together again, which is something I really wanted as well. 

I feel like this thought is keeping him going, but I am loosing patience and at this point I don't know how to help him anymore. The fact that he is understandably depressed about this and keeps telling me he feels terrible if he doesn't see me on the weekend (I haven't been over to his place twice within 1.5 months). He keeps getting angry at companies and tells me he would just straight up refused to talk to recruiters (I convinced him to keep talking to them) and how much he hates HR people. He gets angry and impatient with people who conduct interviews and doesn't want to apply for jobs other than his preferred field.

Generally, he is in a very negative mindset. He used to work out before we met each other but has completely stopped now (not a deal-breaker to me at all, but it kept him happy). He used to neglect seeing his friends on bar night when we were staying at his house together, although I kept telling him to go. He tells me he has nightmares every time I tell him good morning and ask him if he slept well when I leave the house for work. He has trouble getting out of bed and does things and then tells me how much he hated it, although nobody made him do it aside from himself (for example going out to get breakfast before having a coffee and a cigarette).

He still insists on giving me money and wants me to come over all the time or come to my place (even giving me gas money when I do), but I am busy with a full time job, chores, taking care of things here since I haven't been taking care of important things while I wasn't employed/staying at his place and taking care of 2 kittens I adopted some time ago (he is supportive of them while they are not in the way of us seeing each other). I am getting tired of the negativity and from trying to be there for him and it's just very hard to talk to him about this issue.

When we are together everything is great, but being apart and only seeing each other on the weekends makes me resent him slightly for being this stubborn and pressuring me into coming over, because he prefers me being at his place over staying at mine. I might also add that I feel uncomfortable having sex in my apartment because it is quite small and with the kittens being here I just can't do it. He is receiving unemployment benefits until the end of December, but I don't know what is going to happen then.

He is very appreciative of my support and we do love each other, but I don't know for how long I can keep doing this. I told him I'd break up with him because I feel emotionally completely drained, but he said I was giving him a deadline and I was being unfair, but it's been 5 months since he has been employed and on the first date I even said I find unemployment very unattractive and wouldn't tolerate my partner being unemployed for half a year. He is open to conversation and suggestions unless I tell him how unhappy it makes me and phrase it in a way where I want something better for him for him to make him happy.

I might have focused on negative aspects a lot since I am also starting to become quite negative myself on this topic. But he does go out of his way to get me flowers when I'm with him, he cooks for me and he really enjoys taking care of me... It's just that I wish he did this for himself more than he did it for me.
____

tldr: Boyfriend has grand plans for our future, but is incapable of finding a job for several months and my patience is wearing thin and he is becoming increasingly negative. I feel bribed by receiving money from him which I don't need. Overall he is very loving towards me but he neglects himself.

___

I really need advice on how to handle this situation. I don't want to break up with him, but I don't see the situation improving as it is a very delicate subject to him.  How should we move forward from here?",1,1731240749.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Tested on 26/10

I’ve taken so much from this sub and I prolly can’t Thankyou guys enough, but here are my 2 cents. 

I won’t dig deep into the usual methods of studying since you guys prolly know all that, but may ask away in the comments.

A little background
My prep began in 2021, i started off with first aid and bnb and pathoma. I studied on and off, quit a few times, but this last sprint took me 7 months of consistency and tg I killed it. I was a very average student, I couldn’t sit still I had to go out everyday, but the last 7 months it was a now or never situation for me and that derived me to focus. I’d say being consistent and sitting still was the hardest part for me. 

Study methods: 
Apart from the generic FA and UW, the most important resource is MEHLMAN!!!!! I can’t emphasize enough of how important those free pdfs are. ALL OF MEHLMAN IS HY.
I’d annotate uw in first aid, I went thru that book a few times. But towards the end it became a burden and that’s when I reviews systems from MEHLMAN, I wish I started sooner. If I were to suggest the 3 best pdfs, I’d go with 
HY Arrows (do it atleast twice)
HY Neurology (very volatile for me)
HY endocrine (saved my ass cause my exam was heavy on endo and repro)

Things I didnt relate to from this sub:
-The pretty obvious, people scoring 70s and 80s in their nbmes and being a wuss abt it, the am I ready posts 
- getting too frantic about biochem and biostats, my exam wasn’t too heavy on those
- they say that you’re drained out by the 5th block and the last 2 blocks are a nightmare, it’s not. I had my energy thru out, although my eyes were pretty strained cause of the constant focus, but I wasn’t burnt out and unable to think 

NBMES: 
My nbmes were scattered 

25-38%
27-42%
26-46%
28-53%
24-60%
30-54%
29-60%
22-64%
Old free 120-66%
Nbme 21- 61%
Nbme 31-63% (7 days out)
New free 120-67% (2 days out

I would insist on doing all nbmes 20-31 in proper exam conditions, timed and all. It helped me build a stamina and my focus. And the explanations, both correct and incorrect I did them thoroughly. In the last 3 weeks my main focus was nbme explanations and MEHLMAN pds and I think they were the biggest help. 

Exam day: 
I usually am a calm person but I slept for 6ish hours the night of. The fear took the better of me. When I woke up I had coffee and eggs. Took coffee and protein bars along. I only had a few sips of coffee between my breaks. I was pretty calm and confident during the exam. I maked 17 questions per block on average and 2 blocks I marked 22ish, they were my bad blocks. The questions I wasn’t getting I told myself they’re experimental and it helped me keep my shit together. 
The exam is doable, it requires confidence, stay calm, pray, and you’ll be fine inshallah. Give it your best shot, don’t leave any stone unturned. We got this. Good luck!!",2,1731240691.0,step1,0,1.0,False

1gnz2rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1gnz2rs/im_tired_of_my_parents_and_my_siblings/,I'm tired of my parents and my siblings,"Hello everyone, I don't know if you will see this post but I wanted to vent and rant about a lot that's going through my mind right now. Perhaps maybe some of you could relate in some way.
Buckle up cause this is going to be a long one. 

I feel sick and tired of my parents and my siblings. 

Some pre-information before I dive in. I'm currently 18 and a boy. I live with my parents and will probably live with them until I can get a job or until I go to university. My parents are strict and asian

My mother and my father have no energy left for me. I'm the youngest child. They never seem to care about my emotions or how I feel. I could be having a bad day and they won't care. They never seem interested in what i have to say, sometimes it feels like they can't even see me. 

For example, my mother is always glued to her phone, she is always on the phone talking to her siblings or mother and father or other family members everyday. And if she isn't doing that, she is playing games on her phone, and if not that she is watching dramas on her phone. 

Look, I respect her and love that she entertains herself with stuff to do. But its so bad to the point that she doesn't hear me and doesn't pay attention to me if I'm talking to her. She wears ear buds. For God sake, she only ever wears one in her ear but never hears me. For context, I could approach her and be talking to her. She will glance at me and then look back down at her device. I will finish my sentence or whatever the hell I was saying then she will look up and say ""what??"" Then that causes me to repeat. It sometimes happens that I have to repeat myself like three times that I get tired and walk away. 

Now my father, he has no energy, all he ever does is sit on the couch and watch depressing news. If not that he opens his phone and reads depressing news articles or does something related to his job. He listens to me but couldn't really care about me as he says that I should shut up as he doesn't have the energy to hear me. 
Sometimes he will get my hopes up by actually acknowledging me and hearing me and what I have to say. Then after a few days it will be like we never talked and he is suddenly a different person. 

Not to mention, both of them, especially my dad has very bad mood swings.

When you are raised by very very strict parents, you have to think twice before you act or speak. 

I'm 18 but I was also 17 and 16 and 15 and 14 and 13 and etc. 

I noticed this emotional neglection started off when I hit 13. Maybe even before, but It hurts so much when you're parents are emotionally unavailable. 

Another issue I have with my parents is that fact that they love to threaten me. Like if I don't score well, they will threaten me. I already feel like a burden for them having to pay for me having to write my exam papers but that's not my fault, I don't understand why we have to pay for exam papers but it really puts so much pressure on me that I have to perform perfectly. I feel so scared that I will know that I fucked up on an exam and then until results day, I will eat myself up in my thoughts as my parents scare me. They used to hit me a lot when I was younger, now they just shout more and are more verbally abusive. 

I used to think that them punching me or hitting me was bad but the things they say to me is way worse and more painful and words take longer to heal than bruises or wounds. Words really do kill you for many years even after that moment passes.

They threaten me if I stand up for myself, they threaten me if I look at them in the eyes showing them that I'm hurt. One thing that makes me go insane is when they hurt me or my feelings and say to me that I have no right to get sad or upset at them. Like God forbid I act like a normal human with emotions. They don't get to decide how I feel and what hurts me. I cannot believe I have to be shamed for expressing my emotions and that I'm angry or dissapointed or that I'm sad or hurt by them. 

Moving on. I never really had the ability to buy whatever I liked growing up. I used to see others online buying stuff or things that makes them happy. Like for example, when I was a kid, Disney Infinity was a very popular game. I used to love to go to ""toys r us"" and buy the characters figures so that I can play with them in the game. On my birthday I remember many years ago during that period, I went into the shop and I wanted to buy some for my birthday as a gift for myself. My mother made me cry and shamed me and shouted at me in the toy store while everyone was watching. At the end she bought it for me and I walked out of there with tears running down my face, my face and eyes were red and swollen. 
I was just a child. Even if she didn't want to buy them for me on my birthday, she didn't need to go so extremely on me back then. Another example is I really loved legos and still do, I don't know why it brings me joy building them. I used to buy as a kid but my mother used to limit me which isn't an issue as I respect that she was teaching me to understand that I couldn't just grab anything in that store. I haven't bought legos in years. Last year I saw that lego flowers were trending on Instagram and I loved the sunflowers personally so one day I walked with my mother into the lego shop, I showed her them and she said, ""I thought we were done with legos.. Are you stil a kid?? You are embarrassing for you're age. Im ashamed of you"" I was only 16 at the time and was almost about to turn 17. We walked out and she shamed me infront of my dad and got him involved and he also shamed me in public. 

I remember in 2022, It was Christmas season and I really wanted to buy something. My mother said you can buy whatever you want. So I found a site which was selling kpop albums and I loved a few albums and wanted to buy, I told her and she said ""no, I can't believe you want to buy stupid albums. Why are you so weird, I thought you were done with those korean shits"" so after back and forth of her I eventually settled in buying second hand albums off Instagram, the girl who was selling gave me such a good deal and I told her about my mom, she felt sad for me so she gave her posters to me free but only charged me on the albums and said if I grabbed a few she would give a discount. It was a beautiful purchase and I got my bias's photocard but second hand items are usually not in the best condition, two of my albums had scratches and one of them the pages were coming out. 

I had always dreamed of buying Kpop albums ever since I loved kpop since many years now, my first ever purchase sadly was a second hand not in the best condition. The reason I went from and official kpop store selling new kpop albums to a second hand seller on Instagram is because of the price difference and deal and I thought that i should go for the cheapest option as I took into consideration my mother would have to pay for it and i didn't want her to pay so much money.

The process of buying the albums from the instagram seller was hell because in the process I remember my mother shouting at me and shaming me and making me cry like she always does. I told her ""why can other people my age buy albums that makes them happy but I can't?? "" she got more upset. Eventually she bought it but the memories I have whenever I look at my albums now makes me sad. My dad also said to me after the purchase ""we don't buy albums in this house!! Control yourself"" my parents hate the term ""fan"" they say they think fans are obsessed and sick people. They say if you watch something or listen to something, there should be no reason to buy something about that topic as that makes you sick and obsessed. 

That aside I must add that my parents hate kpop, ever since I loved the genre of music, they used to do some God awful things to me and say stuff to me over the years that I will never forget. For example in 2018, I bought a kpop magazine which had stickers and posters inside. It was not official but at the time, I thought to myself that this is probably the closest I'll get to buying Kpop merch. Then a arts project came up at school where were asked to draw a celebrity or a person we admired. I chose Rosé of Blackpink and Jungkook of BTS. So we had to print pictures of the inspiration photos, I sent a memory stick with my father to his office where I had asked for him to print the photos of jungkook and rosé for my school project, I had a sport tournament on the day when he was printing them, I only got home around like 6 p.m and then I was called out of my room after I had changed my clothes. I noticed that something was wrong and off about my parents. I feel really anxious and it felt like my heart was beating in my face. I went into the living room to see the photos on the coffee table. My mother yelled and shouted at me. She said that someone at my father's office came up to my father and said why are you so obsessed with this girl and printing her photos. My mother sadi that I embarrassed my dad at work today. As much as I felt bad, I didn't understand what the issue was as my father requested that i get my inspiration photos printed at his office so I had no other choice and if I never printed them, my school would get angry at me. 

At the end my father shouted at me. He broke a glass on the table out of anger. My mother grabbed me by my ear and took me to my room. She ripped up the photos and said I'm too young to print pictures of a woman. I never had bad intentions as I really loved blackpink and bts at the time, so I picked two members to draw for my arts project. 

After a few minutes after I was beaten up and was dealing with the pain on my body and my swollen eyes from crying. She came back in and asked for that magazine and hid it from me. I never saw it for years. It was only around 2022 Christmas Whej she wanted to give it back to me during Christmas and I went searching for her as she dissapeared from the living room. She was in the storage room and had that same magazine in her hand. I pretended I didn't see and walked out. She never gave it back. And said she threw it into the garbage where it belonged before Christmas. 

Then came that Monday when I went to school, I was sitting in class. Some of my friends which were girls said they noticed that my face looked off and that it looked like I was swollen. My legs and back were bruised from the punching and smacking. I broke down in tears. In arts class, my teacher came up to me and got angry that I didn't have my inspiration photos. I told her my parents ripped it up. She felt bad and said that I should just do something else. When the arts project evening came up. All my classes arts were on display and only mine was the odd one out. People came and walked by wondering why mine was the odd one. I just smiled and had to lie and hide my pain. 

I even have flashbacks of my mother walking into the classroom and throwing my lunch sandwich on the floor or at me. There were many other instances similar to this but I'd rather not say because as I type this I feel my throat is heavy and also it's just too much that I will get tired listing it out. 

Luckily though, now in life I don't get physically abused by my parents in terms of being hit or smacked in the face and punched or suffocated.
It's more verbal abuse now but it still hurts. 

I would add that for the past 3 to 4 years, I have batted and suffered with depression, severe anxiety and dpdr. 
I had two existential crisis last year in 2023. I also am prone to frequent panic attacks. 

I remember it being so bad that my own mortality scared me, I couldn't breath well and couldn't sleep well at night. I suffered a lot alone and on top of that, I was dealing with trauma from encounters with online perverts who said some disgusting things to me. Those traces back to 2020 and 2021 when I thought that making online friends was a good idea. I met good and bad people but I was only 13 or 14 when all that happened online. 

Usually you would think that one should talk to their parents for guidance and help but I never told them out of being scared of them and that they would take my phone away from me and limit me. 

I only told my mom last year but my dad doesn't know still cause I know he will never be able to process it. 

I also almost took my life in 2022 because exam stress got too much and I have no teacher as I'm homeschooling and doing everything on my own. On top of that my father had a heart attack and stroke which took a different toll on me and changed me forever as a person. That happened to him right before my birthday so I spent my 16 birthday alone at home while he was in hospital with everyone else. Obviously he has healed a lot since then. But I started to realise that 2022 was the worst year for me of all. The thought that that could have been my last year is terrifying. 

My parents don't really care about the fact that I was very suicidal back then. They say I'm pathetic and useless. They are the kind of parents that don't believe in mental health issues. 

I have never been to a therapist. I actually was going to start anti depression tablets and my mom shamed me saying that I'm weak and will get addicted to them. I had to stop it after only taking like two.

Just this year I wanted to buy myself a self help book to handle my emotions and pain as I have no one or nothing to help me. I eventually got it but at what cost??? I was shamed  and yelled at and called weak and useless for it. It's actually been a very helpful book. I just feel sad that no one takes me seriously. 

Just last week we went to a big mall. I really love WEDNESDAY and wanted to buy the Wednesday Addams doll from toys r us. I walked in there with my mither and showed her. As soon as she saw the doll. She got very angry and upset. She said ""I'm embarrassed that you at your age want a doll, this is for girls, you are embarrassing, you are weird""

I only wanted the Wednesday doll as a decor in my room as I really loved the netflix series. I wanted to keep it as a memory of something I love, also because season 2 is coming out and I'm exited for it. 

I walked out of there, what hurts is last week she opened a credit card under my name cause im now a classified adult, it's my father's money on that card but she said that I could buy whatever I want and that I should use the card to make sure its working well. So she said when we go to the bigger mall, you can buy ""whatever"" ""you like"" there. Then I grab what I like and Im shamed for it. She also pushed me to give her signage on my credit card so she can use it on my behalf. Like I have any choice to decline. I don't even know why I have that card, I can't use it and I eventually gave it to her and said keep it, not like I'll ever use it. She got pissed. She then said when we got to the smaller mall then you can buy whatever you like. That made my blood boil bexause were were at a huge mall a few days ago which is in a city far from where we live. And for once something I love is in store and I couldn't buy it and now you're telling that exact same shit that I should buy whatever i want from the smaller mall even though I have no business there as that mall doesn't have a book shop selling books I'm interested to buy or even ""toys r us"" for me to buy Wednesday. 

I have been tested so much this past week and on top of that she has been do rude with her attitude and her actions towards me the entire week. After we exited the toy store. I told her ""why don't you ever let me buy something I truly love or like without making me cry or sad or shaming me? "" she said that whatever I love or like in terms of interests or hobbies is weird and useless. She said that ""when you get older,  go buy whatever the hell you want cause I'll never pay for anything you want!!""

The sad part is that I'm a child or son that never really asks for much. I'm usually very quiet and respectful and understanding but when different opportunities come and go. I try to buy something cause I also deserve to be happy. But I guess that doesn't seem to be the case with my parents. I feel sad chase by the time I actually make my own money and work a job which will be in like 5 to 6 years ir even more. Most of the things I love, won't even be in store. Albums are not always going to be there, Wednesday doll won't always be there. The factory only creates a certain amount. Maybe they might reproduce but that liklihood is so low as there's always new things and new albums. Stuff pass. Time passes, stuff leave. I only have one life and when I look back on my life, I get sad that my parents never supported me or respected me or ever took the time to learn about me and understand and respect my interests, hobbies and what makes me happy.

They barely know me well. The deem they know me so well but they fail time and time again. 

Obviously they don't owe me anything. They shame me for wanting to buy these kinds of stuff even at the age of 18. They don't understand that I never really got to live my childhood. When I do or buy things that make me happy. It feels like healing my inner child. Instead of acting my age I will always feel younger mentally and want things that I never got. There are people older than me buying albums but when I do it, it's bad.

Istg, I could never breath or act normal like others all because my parents found fault in me through everything. 

None of my parents are satisfied or proud of me. 
My mother has this thing where she says, she trusts me but then says she doesn't. She has gone so much back and forth with playing around with me that I honestly don't give a fuck if she trusts me or not. Thats her issue and her problem. 

She loves to say to me ""one day you will understand"" ""one day you will have a child who will do this stuff to you""

And I'm like in my head, ""why tf should my child be shy or scared to come talk to me about anything that's bothering them? "" ""why should my child not be able to express themselves in their hobbies and interests? "" why should my child be keeping secrets from me if I'm a good parent that my child can trust?? "". At the end of the day if I had a child and I disagreed with them, we would talk it out in a healthy way. Everything I went through, I will never let my child go through. I will break the toxic cycle of my parents.

Sometimes I look back on my life and think how crazy it is that I'm still breathing and pushing through for better days. I have been through so much that I haven't even listed everything here.

My mother and father are very selfish people, they only think they are right and anyone who thinks otherwise may not speak against them. My mother is embarrassing in general. I would say she complains in public and demands so much from workers. She even went as far as ignoring a police officer while he was talking to her. She likes to always be first in lines. She never understands that one way or another, you will go into the damn plane too. Omfg. 

I'd like to add that I hate how I'm even related to my parents as we are very very different people. It's so bad that I sometimes think it was a absolute mistake that I ended up as their child. I can't even critique them. They can't handle criticism or talk like normal individuals without lashing out

My dad is every unhygienic, he never washes his hands, he goes to the toilet and says, ""I never touched anywhere"" you asshole, you touched youre dick. You disgusting man. I get sick thinking that I used to go hug this man as a kid not knowing that he never washes his hands and gets pissed off if you tell him to wash his hands. 
He itches his ass, he cuts his toe nails on the coffee table. He pops his pimples, 

Thinking about him makes me feel sick because he would always shame me for not liking to be dirty, he would shame me and call me gay cause I hate facial hair, I like to take care of myself. I like to care of my skin and hair and maintain my smell and sweat. I like to be clean. 

I cannot believe I have to be called gay which isn't a bad thing just for taking care of myself. Also I hate that my father never respected my choices or my will to do something. He always forced his ideas on me on what sports to do and in general whatever he thought was best for me. It was like he wanted to live my life for me, 

I'd say that my parents made me hate studying so much that only recently am i trying to fix my relationship with my studies and do it for myself. 

I'm nothing like my parents, and I'm proud to be different. I'm proud of who I am at the end of the day and I'm glad I turned out the way I did. 

I just pray for days when I will be living alone and have better people in my life. 

Sorry for the long rant, I have been debating whether to get on reddit and just let it all out but I'm just so tired and exhausted and mentally drained. They critique and judge me in everyway shape and form. There was even a moment when my mother called me ugly 

I'd love to hear what you all have to say

I stood in the gym, doctors all around me, their eyes glued to me like I was some science experiment—which, let’s be real, I was. They scribbled on clipboards, murmuring to each other, barely looking up as I grabbed the barbell and hoisted it. They’d loaded it up to something ridiculous—**ten** **tons**, easy. Enough weight to flatten a person. I pulled it off the ground, the floor creaking beneath me, and the whole bar bowing slightly. The weights clanked like metal thunder as I kept lifting, sweat trickling down my neck. The docs in their white coats whispered and exchanged nods, checking my every move like they were afraid I'd suddenly grow a third arm.

Through the glass walls of the gym, I spotted Jill walking beside the commander in the hallway. Her head barely reached his shoulder, and her arms crossed tightly over her chest as he leaned down to talk, his calm, controlled gestures almost towering over her. Jill nodded now and then, her jaw clenched, barely looking up. I adjusted my grip and hoisted the barbell, loading on another set of plates that groaned as I lifted. When I glanced back, they’d stopped by the door, the commander's face intent while Jill’s remained apprehensive.

When I finally dropped the barbell, they waved me off toward the mess hall to eat. It was the same as always—sterile and quiet, with rows of polished metal tables under harsh fluorescent lights. I grabbed a tray, stacked with whatever passed for food here. I found a spot at the far end of the room and sat alone. I saw a few other recruits sitting around, heads down, shoveling in their rations.

New faces, I thought. Glad to know Jack and Jill aren’t the only people here besides eggheads and guards.

As I chowed down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the food wasn’t cutting it. I wolfed down everything on my tray, but the gnawing hunger just wouldn’t quit. So I headed back to the chow line and zeroed in on the lady behind the counter.

*“Meat. Raw,”* I said, the words slipping out almost instinctively.

She raised an eyebrow, hesitating as if trying to decide whether I was serious or just messing with her. But my expression didn’t change.

I slid the tray across the counter, and without a word, she dropped a massive, blood-red steak onto it. Beef. The thing looked like it had just been pulled from the cow, still dripping with blood. 

I didn’t flinch. Just picked it up, feeling the weight of it in my hands, and walked off. The whole place smelled like antiseptic and stale bread, but that steak—now that was what I needed.

The new recruits watched me as if they had just seen a savage cannibal eating human remains but I didn’t mind, they could watch for all I cared. I was hungry.

I’d just finished the last bite when I saw Jack stroll into the dining hall, looking like he’d just woken up from a nap. As soon as he got to the counter, he didn’t even hesitate, straight-up ordering raw meat.

I left my tray on the table and headed out, but something caught my eye as I passed Jill’s room. The door was cracked open, just enough to see the faintest sliver of light spilling through.

I pushed the door open just a bit more and stepped inside, catching sight of Jill in the middle of tossing her things into a duffel bag. She didn’t even look up at first, just hurriedly folding a shirt.

*“You’re really serious about this?”* I asked, leaning against the doorway, my arms crossed.

She paused, glancing at me over her shoulder. *“Yeah, it’s time for me to start a new life,”* she said, voice steady but her eyes a little happier than usual.

*“You have someone waiting for you in Germany?”* I asked, pushing off the doorframe and stepping inside.

I wasn’t sure what I was expecting, but I knew it wasn’t this. 

Jill shrugged, her gaze flickering to the bag as she zipped it up. *“Yeah, she was wonderful.”*

I tilted my head, trying to make sense of it. *“What’s so wonderful about her?”*

She smiled faintly, her hands still working on the bag. *“She knows who I am. All the parts of me I never let anyone see. And... she accepts them.”*

I could feel the weight of her words, but I didn’t push. *“Sounds like she’s worth it.”*

Jill’s lips pressed into a thin line, and she finally met my eyes, the faintest flicker of something softer in her expression. *“Sometimes, running’s the only thing that makes sense. The way things are... I don’t belong here anymore. And you don’t either. If you’re honest with yourself.”*

I swallowed, her statement cutting through like glass. *“Maybe I don’t. But I’m not running. Not yet, anyway.”*

Her gaze softened just a little like she understood more than she let on, but she didn’t say anything. Jill just let out a low breath, turning back to her bag like she couldn’t be bothered to say more. *“You’ll figure it out. You always do.”*

I stood there a moment longer, but I could tell this conversation had run its course. I wanted to say something, anything, to make her stay. But I knew better. She’d made up her mind.

*“Take care of yourself, Jill.”*

*“Always. I’ll be leaving at 14:00.”* She flashed me a quick, fleeting smile before turning back to finish packing. 

14:00. The time stuck with me. I remember the numbers scrawled on that basement card. I glanced over Jill’s clock—just a few hours left. A knot twisted in my stomach, but I brushed it off and headed back to my room. Her words still echoed in my head as I walked down the hallway, the ticking clock syncing with the thoughts bouncing around in my brain.

I needed a nap, so I set an alarm and went straight to bed. 

Then I had a dream. One that I could never forget, even until now. 

I was in the olden days, someone was on horseback going through the mountains of a night. It was cold and snowing, riding hard across the country. He rode past me and kept on going. Never said anything going by. He just rode on with his blanket wrapped around him and his head down. I heard the horse’s hooves drumming and scattering divots of white earth. I saw he was carrying fire in a horn the way people used to do, and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. About the color of a red flower. And in the dream, I knew that he was going on ahead and that he was fixing to make a fire somewhere out there in the darkness, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. Out there up ahead.

I was no longer human. I looked down and saw my paws—orange and striped like a tiger’s. I was stalking him. My body moved silently through the snow, low to the ground, every muscle taut as I approached the man sitting beside his campfire. He hadn’t noticed me. I could see him now, hunched over, poking at the flames, his back turned to me.

I let out a low growl, barely audible, but it didn’t seem to reach his ears. My heart pounded as I crept closer, the heat of the fire warming my fur. I was so close now. My victim was within reach.

The man turned to look at me. Too late, I pounced. My body sprang forward, and everything went still, the fire flickering in the moment before impact. 

Just as I was about to land, the dream snapped, and I was awake, lying in bed, my heart racing.

I remembered that man looked like me. Maybe he *was* me. 

It was a weird dream, the kind that sticks with you even after you wake up. It felt like I was caught in the body of two people at once—the tiger, stalking and pouncing, and the poor guy by the fire, unaware of what was coming. Both of them, but also neither. It was like I was watching myself from the outside, seeing myself as both the predator and the prey. I couldn’t shake the feeling that it meant something. It was like the dream was trying to tell me something I couldn’t quite grasp.

The clock flicked to 13:50. I pulled on my hoodie and tucked the card into my pocket. The hallway was dead quiet, so I moved quickly. The guards were distracted, heads turned, too busy with their routines to notice, probably bored out of their minds.

When I hit the office, I slipped inside and grabbed a map from the desk. The egghead was out grabbing coffee—perfect timing. I didn’t even need to glance at it. A part of me wondered if I was making a mistake. But that thought didn’t stick. Not with time running out.

I kept my eyes glued to the map as I made my way down to the basement. The place felt like it was made to confuse you—nothing was ever straightforward, and the hallways twisted more than they needed to. When I reached the door, I unlocked it quietly and stepped in. The air was colder, a little too sterile, like the whole place was built to feel like it didn’t belong anywhere.

The hall stretched out in front of me, and I stopped dead. Tanks. Rows of them, filled with weird-colored liquid—some blue, some green, others looking like they'd been dipped in blood. I could barely make out what was inside, but the shapes were hard to miss.

The first tank had a woman curled up in a fetal position, her short hair almost blending with the liquid. Her features were off—her ears were too pointy, claws at the ends of her fingers, and a tail swished weakly like a resting cat. I blinked, wondering if I was imagining it.

I moved on to the next tank. This one was even worse. The guy inside was all———well, his limbs were way too long, stretching out like rubber. His face was gone, completely smooth, with no features at all. No eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing. It was like someone had taken a person and completely erased their face. I couldn’t look at it for too long.

Another tank caught my eye. Inside it was a guy that looked straight out of a horror show. He had scaly skin, a long snout, and sharp teeth. Everything about this person screamed reptile, but they still looked... human. No doubt about it, this one was a damn crocodile person. Just another freak show in a place full of ‘em.

My eyes were drawn to the two tanks at the end of the hall, both labeled ""Ed 2"" and ""Jack 2."" The tanks were filled with clear liquid, but what caught my breath was what was inside them. Clones—they were exact replicas of me and Jack. Their bodies, their faces, like they’d been pulled straight from our DNA.

As I continued walking, the tanks ended. A doorway opened up to rows of cages. I walked past them, trying to ignore the dread coalescing in the pit of my stomach. Each cage was like its own twisted world. One of them caught my attention first—a deformed puppy, barely recognizable as a little girl. She had these huge, sad eyes, and was whimpering, trying to paw at the bars, desperate to be let out. She couldn’t have been much older than a pup, but there was something so broken about her as she yearned to see freedom.

A few cages down, a fight broke out. A guy with the body of a man but the head of a sheep was throwing his fists through the bars of another cage. Inside that one was some kind of animal-person hybrid, all sharp claws and teeth, hissing back like a pissed-off wildcat.

I kept walking, but the sound of something skittering across the floor caught my attention. I looked over just in time to see a person—no, more like a fish-man—jerking around in a cage, eyes wide with panic. They were reacting to things that weren’t there, twisting and twitching like the whole world was after them.

And then there was the kitten. A weird, unholy version of one, curled in the corner of its cage, focused on something in its hands. I could barely make out what it was, but then it clicked—a makeshift knife, scratched together from something sharp, probably a piece of metal or glass. It was like they had no choice but to survive this hellscape however they could.

Further into the hallway, I spotted a half-man, half-rhino thing lying on the floor of its cage, trying to sleep… but the noise from the other cells kept snapping it awake. Every time it tried to get some rest, the clanging and screaming from the other cages would pull it right back into the mess.

The whole place felt like a prison. But not just for the people inside. It felt like the whole building was caged in too. Locked up tight with no way out. I couldn’t shut out the noises of fear, desperation, and confusion. I couldn't shake the feeling that this was just the beginning.

I reached another door, my hands shaking as I twisted the handle. Inside, I passed a control room, hearing the flickering hum of computers. A soldier sat behind the desk, glued to his screen, but I barely registered him. 

I turned away and saw the arena ahead. The whole place opened up into a proper fighting cage—octagonal, the kind you only see in places built for bloodsport. And there, in the center, stood Jack. His hands were wrapped around something, and as I stepped closer, I realized it was Jill. 

She was dead. Her body hung limp, a sickly weight in his grasp. 

*""Jill?!""* I rushed forward, my heart slamming against my chest, but I couldn’t do anything. 

I couldn’t bring her back.

The voice came from behind me, cool and almost amused. *""We’ve been expecting you.""*

I spun around to see the head physicist—egghead, as I liked to call him—leaning casually against the doorframe. He barely seemed fazed, like what had just happened was normal.

*""She failed her final test,""* he said without a flicker of remorse. *""It was fortunate. She would've quit if she survived, though.""*

I couldn’t even process what he was saying. My mind was still stuck on Jill, on her lifeless body in Jack’s hands. I was royally pissed, a heat that burned right through my chest. 

*""I’m not doing this anymore!""* My voice cracked, but I didn’t care. *""I quit.""*

The egghead looked at me, his eyes cold, apathetic.

*""You didn’t go through the proper paperwork like Jill did, 17703,""* he said, his voice too calm. *""So I’m afraid I can’t let you go... Jack, you know what to do.""*

With that, the egghead turned and walked out, locking the door behind him. 

I heard Jack’s low growl echo through the cage. When I turned, his smile hit me like a punch. It wasn’t a smile anymore—it was something... worse. His teeth were jagged, not human. He stepped forward, muscles bulging, his body rippling like something unnatural was shifting beneath his skin. 

*“Get into the ring,”* Jack growled, his voice a distorted hiss. He didn’t move—just stood there, all muscles and teeth, ready for a fight.

The rage that boiled inside me was like nothing I’d ever felt before. The fact that he’d killed Jill, just like that, for nothing more than a test, a sick experiment—it was too much.

Without a second thought, I sprinted at him, my feet pounding the ground so hard I could feel the concrete crack beneath my steps. Every muscle in my body screamed with fury. I wasn’t thinking about strategy or survival. I just wanted to hurt him—wanted to make him feel even a fraction of the pain he’d caused.

The guy in the control room pulled a lever. The lights blinked red. 

Jack bulked up. His whole body contorted, his bones cracking and reshaping as he changed into something out of a nightmare. His face elongated into a snout, his limbs twisted and grew, and in seconds, he was a half-man, half-dinosaur abomination—a human velociraptor on steroids, twice the size. 

*""This,""* the egghead’s voice crackled through the intercom, *""was the goal of our experiment. This is what you are fighting for.""*

I could barely breathe, my heart racing in my chest. 

*""You’re more than test subjects now,""* the egghead continued, his voice smooth, detached. *""You are super-soldiers. And whoever wins will receive power and privilege beyond your wildest dreams.""*

That’s when it hit me, hard. All those freaks I fought—the ones that looked like animals, half-broken and twisted—were failures. They’d been discarded. Those were the ones who hadn’t met the egghead’s expectations. They either rotted in cages or were sent into the ring to fight us… no, to be MURDERED by us. 

Wendigo, Bigfoot, and the countless other freaks we fought. It wasn’t a fight. It was MURDER and ABUSE.

Jack, Jill, and I? We were the ones who didn’t fall apart. We were the ones who didn’t go insane or grow weak from the drugs. We were the success stories.

And now, it was all coming down to this—survival of the fittest.

I love, love, love you rabbity.

Is this what happiness feels like?

I'm so happy! Now

Thank you for being my paradise.

Is it okay if I hug you Rabbity?

**Snow White** :

I still remember your face a year ago, when I fed you rats

You adapted to surface quicker than I expected.

I like you. we even have same preferences in food.

From then on, I found a lot of precious food on the surface .

If we can meet on surface this time, I will let you taste it.

Also it would be good if you bring some food from ark next time we meet.

It doesn't matter what its expiration date is, don't worry.

**Dorothy :**

Do you miss Eden? If you want to leave the ark, you are always welcome.

Well, it's impossible for you to abandon the Nikkes around you and come to Eden.

I'm still standing in the sunny(Brightest) part of Eden, but I don't feel as lonely as I did in the past.

Because there is no one else but you who brought back my smile after a long time.

Then...let's go find it again someday. ‘The flower’ that blooms on the surface.

**Diesel :**

**\[Spoilers for her bond story\]**

"" Onii-san(Brother) is in the elevator ? ""

Hehehe. I wondered if you still remember the time you were called that by the children.

a year had already passed.

Now that I think about it,  the memorial day of the train attack is getting closer again.

**Commander : ""...""**

Commander, don’t worry. Both Soline and Brid are still worried about me, but I believe that I will definitely wake up on this year's memorial day. ( play Diesel's bond story to understand this )

Commander, do you trust me ?

........Thank you, Commander.

‘Train splendamin’ , ‘Ark ranger Figure’ and ‘Commander’s Textbook with Anderson’s Autograph’ were all left infront of the memorial by the commander(you).

Thanks to you and to all the things in front of the memorial that gave me courage...

On the 'anniversary of my brother's death' this year, I will definitely wake up and attend the memorial service as the leader of Infinity Rail.

And, Commander... may I ask you a favor?

Would you please join me in this year's memorial service? I believe that my brother in heaven will definitely smile if i am with the commander.

Thank you, Commander!",3,1731239464.0,NikkeMobile,0,1.0,False

I was in the middle of a depressive episode and felt a strong urge to write about it. It's a bit intense, so fair warning.
-------‐---------------
I didn't wake up this morning feeling like I want to die. S cuddled me and made me coffee before he had to leave to meet some of his friends. He asked if I wanted to come. I did not. Instead, I'm at his place, engulfed by his surroundings, awaiting his return. The house smells like him, which is vaguely comforting. 

I drank my coffee, I called my parents, and I took a shower. I stared at myself in the steamed mirror as I started applying my serums and creams, things I used to care about a great deal about at some point. And out of nowhere, it began. The tears, and the incessant feeling of being done with everything. I stood in the bathroom for a while, staring at my reflection in the mirror, asking myself what's wrong. The truth is, nothing is wrong yet somehow everything is. And the tears refused to stop.

All things considered, my life is technically great. I have loving parents who've given me the world, a wonderful partner who wants to build a life with me, and caring friends who check up on me even when I fail to keep in touch. I live in a nice country, I'm financially comfortable, and I'm doing what I've wanted to all my life. Everything is good. Then what even is the problem? Do I just reek privilege when I talk about feeling hollow? 

Somehow, everything feels fleeting and meaningless. Perhaps it's the nature of my job, and the endless vastness that contributes to this feeling. In the grand scheme of things, what does any of it really even matter? Or perhaps depression really is just this: ugly crying on the couch for no apparent reason, with a bowl of cereal while staring at the endlessly gray skies outside. There's no romanticized version of depression, there's also no ""fun"" version of it as I always like to joke. It's just ugly and soul-sucking, almost like having a monster lurking in your shadows, ready to attack at any given point of weakness. 

What then, is the solution to it all? I am a scientist after all, and finding answers is part of my job. I certainly don't have all the answers yet, but on days when I can muster up the energy and with the support of loved ones, I test various hypotheses to see what might be it. In some sense, I think we're all just scientists, just trying to stay afloat in this impossibly small yet big world, worrying about such meaningless yet enormous problems, caring about nothing yet everything. How strange it is that we spend all our years, constantly coexisting with such massive contradictions. ",1,1731239218.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
1gnywum,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1gnywum/had_to_call_cops_on_upstairs_tenant_after_violent/,Had to call cops on upstairs tenant after violent outburst ,"I've been having issues on and off with a drug addicted tenant who shares the first floor of a one level house I rent (I live in the basement). Over the past few months he's become increasingly more paranoid, erratic and sometimes violent (mostly towards inanimate objects). This morning I finally had to call the police on him after he went on a glass smashing spree (in my part of the house no less) while on what seemed to be a coke/crack fueled bender. Before I did that I had to fend him off with a very small plastic paring knife, threatening to use it if he didn't get back up to his floor and stop destroying stuff, as I had no idea what he was planning to do next and didn't want to wait around to find out. 

When the cops got there, I noticed they were unusually lenient and accommodating with the guy who was obviously drugged out of his mind (I believe he had some white substance on his upper lip that I don't think was icing sugar) and basically said that this was only a minor domestic dispute and they were going to take him for coffee until he calmed down, and then were going to let him come back to the house in a couple hours. I voiced some concerns about this, citing a previous incident where something similar happened (b&e into my place with a baseball bat in the middle of the night during a paranoid episode) and one of the cops just said ""well that was then, not now, so it's not relevant"". The cop also said that if they arrested him they'd probably have to arrest me too since I had a knife at one point, even though I was just defending myself with it and wasn't hoping to use it, and because I also opened the door while he was outside the basement area instead of staying inside, which was potentially escalating the situation. Their conclusion was he wasn't really a threat and we should both just work out our differences, talk to the landlord about it, get locks for the doors, or I should just leave. 

Since I haven't had much experience with this kind of situation until recently, is this standard protocol for police when dealing with these kinds of things or do they usually take it as a more serious safety risk for both tenants? I'm in Canada btw. And yes, I am planning to move pretty soon.  ",2,1731239142.0,legal,0,1.0,False

Call it magical thinking or faith, but I can’t help but think that there must be a solution to be found in sustainable, natural materials; we just haven’t looked hard enough, yet. 

I know there was a lot of testing of cloth mask materials back in the day when there was a PPE shortage. 

I was in a local mask sewing club, on behalf of kids, first responders, doctors, nurses, etc. 

We used 200 thread count cotton and cotton quilting fabric for our masks, with metal coffee bag closets for inserts in the nose part, but a lot of that decision-making had to do with what was readily available and could be sterilized in the autoclave, not what was the absolute best material for filtration.

I am anticipating that buying power will be reduced even more, under the incoming administration, and masks may become yet harder to get. 

Plus, the factory-to-dump pipeline is so repugnantly unsustainable. There has to be a better way. 

Maybe it’s hemp gauze and milkweed pods (just fantasizing/spitballing). 

Anyway, since practically every time I come up with a brilliant invention, someone else has already thought of it and executed it, I figured I’d ask here. Have silk and/or felted wool been tested for their ability to filter COVID? ",0,1731238163.0,Masks4All,2,0.5,False

– Ralph didn’t go to school and look at the money he was making when he was my age

– Tony, I’m gonna be alright now. I’m going to design men’s suits. Meadow thinks I should go to the Fashion Institute

I like Tony's brilliant mute reaction, whose face at first shows obvious surprise that Jackie might be even more disappointing than he thought, which gradually blurs into Tony’s sarcastic smile.

A couple of the things she talked about really resonated with me:

1. She mentions about having to almost re learn how to make even the most basic decisions for yourself when you are out of an abusive relationship. You find yourself not knowing if you should take a shower, if you want to grab a coffee or not, if you should or even want to meet up with friends etc. You live your life with all your agency taken away for so long that you  forget what your own drive and desires even are and how to feel them, let alone act on them. At some point it feels like you cease to exist as a separate individual and just become an extension of the abusers will - the way she articulated it really struck me, maybe you guys here can relate as well.


2. She touches on how 'boring' the abuse is, in the sense that so many people exhibit the same behaviours and patterns. At first you believe that this is just the special nature of your relationship and it's a thing you struggle against together that no one else would understand, but the more you learn about abuse and it's patterns, you discover that actually it is SO pedestrian and commonplace. Almost like the abusers are reading from a script that they have on some kind of How To Victimise forum. 

She really captured the kind of disbelief and almost a feeling if vertigo that I personally felt when first coming to terms with the fact that I was in an abusive relationship. When reading Jess Hills book See What You Made Me Do I would be sat there stunned, as if someone was narating my own life back to me. 

Anyway I found it quite validating and eye opening and she's an amazing person. Maybe (hopefully) you will get something from it as well.



P.s. I'd not listened to any other episodes of the podcast before and I found the male host to have a kinda weird vibe, a bit paternalistic and the discussion was pretty gender based as you could assume from the title.

I have to get up at 5am every morning to get my husband's breakfast, lunch, work clothes, coffee and meds ready for him. We've been short on food this week so I bought things I knew he liked on grocery day. This morning I do my routine and I make him a sausage egg and cheese bagel. To save on dishes, I cooked the egg in the same pan as the sausage after it was done, then placed the cheese and sausage and wrapped the egg around it and then onto the bagel. 
My husband goes down to get his stuff and brings the sandwich up to me and offers for me to eat it instead because 
1. He doesn't like the egg is brown colored from the sausage grease.
2. He likes all the elements separated, not the way I did it.

He thanked me for making it but won't eat it. I'm upset cuz I worked hard on making sure it came out good. But I wasn't gonna get a separate pan to cook an egg to make it look yellow. He said if I know it tastes good, then I should eat it. 
In the end he took it back, upset at me for arguing with him about it. Saying I always have to argue about something with him and shit all over him.

[28M] [30F] ,"I’ve been on 3 dates with this girl. I’m about to go on a 4th today but it’s more a go get a coffee and cake with her then probably head back to hers. We’ve been booking up since date 1. 

I am usually someone who dates to find a partner. In fact i probably still am. That’s what I want. But I’m pretty sure this girl isn’t that. 

I really enjoy being around her. She’s a lot of fun. And the sex is great. But she is extremely close with her ex of 8 years, he even came over for a pizza night with her the night after I stayed. And I just don’t want that in a relationship. She says nothing happens but it’s just too odd for me. She’s also just probably not the kind of girl I’d want to introduce to my parents. 

But. When I had a discussion about what she wants she said ‘somewhere between casual fun and a relationship.’  When I asked if she’s fucking other people she said not right now but it may happen down the line. She isn’t ready to be exclusive yet. 

So I’m now questioning what I do. Usually if I’m sleeping with someone consistently, I catch feelings. But with her I feel I shouldn’t. 

But she is also quite inconsistent with her communication. Sometimes it seems she really wants a bf. Sometiems it doesn’t. 

I don’t want to discuss this heavily yet in case it implies I want her to be my gf. Which I don’t yet. But i also feel confused about how to keep seeing her without someone getting hurt?

Toronto, ON, is a popular vacation retreat with unique event spaces to host everything from social gatherings to corporate events. The party venues and meeting rooms in Toronto suit diverse occasions.

* **Art Gallery:** Toronto supports the creative industry and one of its cultural institutions can double as a unique event space. Some of these establishments are space-only settings — meaning you can bring in all your materials and create a unique event. Alternatively, you could opt for even venues with all the art still on site.
* **Dining Room:** A dining room is a classic event venue. A coffee shop with an indoor space and outdoor patio is a favorite choice for everything from a private event and wedding rehearsal to a live music experience. A vintage brewery is a unique venue choice, lending itself to Toronto’s Distillery District reputation and fame.
* **Gardens and Outdoor Locations:** Your venue search will lead you to the local gardens and outdoor locations. A rooftop garden is the perfect venue for a reception, mixer, live performance, and other social gathering. These event venues showcase offer panoramic views. A backyard and patio with an outdoor fireplace and pool create a cozy feeling that invites conversations. A rooftop deck might be just the change that will keep your guests talking.
* **Conference Room:** Meeting venues in North Toronto host important events throughout the year. These event venues are often located in the heart and accommodate corporate teams for meetings. Explore some of the unique venues near the Lawrence Centre.
* **Unusual Locations:** Give your guests an unusual experience by choosing an event venue away from the heart of Downtown Toronto. The area has unique event spaces offering uncommon features. These event venues have exposed brick walls, hardwood floors, high ceilings, natural light, or stone arches, offering stunning views and photo backdrops. It's an added plus if the event venue offers free parking and access to an indoor space or multiple areas.",2,1731236517.0,GiggsterHQ,0,1.0,False

-I counted no less than 3 shirt grabs against us with no calls. Then he calls a PK from a slight pull back where the guy throws himself forward? That’s shit reffing in the last minute.
-Patrick was sooooo close to being onside but I do think he was inches off. I was sitting on 30 yard line and just maybe he was slightly off. No VAR to check it is crap.
-We have to score more. It said 4 shots on goal, but the only true shot I saw was the goal.
-Kahlina saved us over and over. Was a terribly unlucky bounce to go right back to the penalty taker.
-Orlando fans and their SS were loud and it was a great atmosphere. On the flip side, that team can suck a sack of balls. They are the whiniest most flopping players in the league. The pure hatred I have for them is real!

Was a hell of season. Great run at the end and we know what we need in our team. I’m excited as hell for next season!

In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.

I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.

Have lived with it all my life and I hate visitors as much now as 1967, remember social functions back then vividly and not with pleasure. I had a couple of extremely social years, starting in the 80`s when studying and also after acne and bullying pestered teens, I became considered handsome and generally attractive, both sexually and socially. And OK, I got some talents, especially when intoxicated, to radiate some working class chumminess that people like. But still, all those years, I ended the parties asap and became exhaused. And still eg at the examination parties for my kids I will find a closet to go into foster position in agony

But still, even when in that agony it’s kind of interesting. I can like think, why do I lie here? Noone have said or done anything mean to me. And sitting around the table at a coffee break hearing people behave extrovert ways, I can think, why can’t I understand this? Why does this wear me out?

There is all kinds of brain research going on eg the Left vs Right hemispheres(and not surprisingly thing arent as easy as research earlier said) and it would be kinda interesting to know what part of my brain is fucked up.

One thing - having as I suppose most of you guys - pretty hard to maintain eye contact, I sometimes set out to do that, like for whole days, to seek and keep eye contact with people and its like wow.

Meanwhile, the stock is priced for perfection...","**Apparently, Apple has been having problems with iPadOS 18 bricking devices for the past two months. While my problem was easily solved, it calls into question the usual perfection of Apple products. I am glad that I sold my Apple shares on Friday...**

People buy Apple products because they are beautiful and because they work. Yesterday, I bought the new iPad Pro (13-inch) with Apple's own M4 chip. I couldn't wait to get it out of the box and set up my new iPad. Unpacking Apple's thoughtfully designed, high-quality packaging was, as always, a very satisfying experience. Anyone who has ever bought a new Apple product knows the feeling, even the smell is special.  
  
I placed my new and old iPads next to each other to transfer the data as usual. After clicking through the familiar menus, the new iPad (which came with a version of iPadOS 17) wanted to update to iPadOS 18.1. The update began, and I went to get a cup of coffee. After 15 minutes, I found the iPad with a frozen screen, unable to update. I was pretty surprised, maybe it's the Wi-Fi? I rebooted the router and started over. Twenty minutes later I was back and the screen was frozen again and the iPad wouldn't update.  
  
Next, I tried to set up the new iPad using a backup of my old iPad from the cloud instead of transferring it from iPad to iPad, which also didn't work. I spent the next 2 hours of my free Saturday resetting the iPad and redoing the installation. I'm so used to Apple's quality that it doesn't even occur to me that the iPad is the problem and not somehow me. At some point (way too late) I googled the problem and found many desperate forum posts about the problem starting in September. I also found articles from late September saying that Apple had solved the problem. It's November, can it really be that Apple hasn't fixed an annoying issue like this?  
  
At some point I reached the end of my rope and called Apple support. After a surprisingly short wait of no more than 3 minutes, I spoke to a very friendly lady who immediately knew what to do (so the problem seemed to be known). Following her instructions, I reset the iPad again, connected it to my Mac, and updated the iPad from my Mac (you have to select the freshly reset iPad in the Finder to update it). This worked, and I was finally able to transfer my old iPad to the new one, which was now running iPadOS 18.1.  
  
I was relieved that my new iPad was working, but extremely annoyed that this had cost me my Saturday afternoon (not to mention my blood pressure). I contact the Apple Premium Reseller who sold me the iPad. The salesman, who was also very friendly, admits that 18 desperate customers have returned to the store with this problem in the last few days alone. But his workaround is different from the one Apple support recommends: He first sets up the iPad without a backup, then installs iPadOS 18.1, and then resets the iPad so that the transfer or restore from a backup can begin without the mandatory update. Apparently, the new iPad Pro is not able to do both restore from backup and update on its own.  
  
The salesman also told me that the same problem sometimes occurs with the new iPhone 16, and that desperate users keep coming back with their brand-new, useless devices. When I ask the salesman why he didn't warn me, he avoids answering my question and tells me that these new problems are driving him to despair as well.  
  
Anyway, my new iPad Pro works now, and I love it. But less so with Apple. Software is getting more complex and bugs are going to happen, but Apple's inability to fix a problem like this with their new devices in 2 months is astounding. Even the prettiest packaging won't help if you annoy your customers with devices that are bricked because they can't do a mandatory update. I expect Apple products to just work - that promise has now been broken for me.  
  
Coincidentally, I sold my Apple shares last Friday as the stock seemed ""priced for perfection"". On Friday, I was still struggling with this decision, especially since I wanted to buy a new Apple device the very next day. But after my experience with my new iPad, I am very happy with my decision to get out of the stock. I wouldn't underestimate this problem. Apple waited to implement generative AI on its devices and announced and released IOS 18 with great fanfare. I doubt the ""perfection"" that is expected from Apple with a new OS that has been bricking (some) new devices for 2 months.",0,1731235119.0,wallstreetbets,7,0.23,False
1gnxwky,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gnxwky/did_you_ever_read_a_book_that_make_you_laugh_out/,Did you ever read a book that make you laugh out loud? What book and what passage?,"I am not the kind of person who laughs out loud at things. I sometimes smile to myself and occasionally chuckle. And rarely at what I consider juvenile or meanspirited or grossout humor.

But there are exceptions, lol.

From time to time, I have come across something that was really funny, and maybe also as a result of being tired and unable to control myself, I have laughed out loud.

Most recently I was reading Moby Dick, and then came across this passage, which is about Ishmael and fellow sailors squeezing the oil from a recently killed sperm whale:

>Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,- Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.

Ishmael's excitement and the word play was just a little too much and I saw a couple of people look at me, probably wondering why I burst out laughing in this quiet coffee place.

Has that happened to you?

P.S. Moby Dick is a tough book to read (I don't even know how to classify it), and there are many terms you have to look up, but it's also quite hilarious in parts and generally entertaining.",19,1731235028.0,books,69,0.89,False

Before surgery I was a type 2 diabetic, which post surgery and thanks to my low sugar diet I've gotten into remission. Visiting Japan with these requirements was pretty daunting but I've gotten by so far. Here are my findings from being here, for anyone else that might be looking in the future.

Savas yoghurt at Lawson has 15g protein and only 2.5g sugar. I've found it at all Lawson's in both Tokyo and Kyoto.

Sugar free chocolate, malt balls and biscuits in the Zero range by meji are sold at almost all konbinis in some form, and they're pretty good!

The Zero range, along with another brand called Sunao also make ice creams that I was able to find all across Tokyo, but not in Kyoto. I'll report back on if I find them in Osaka.

Sugar free drinks are hard to find outside of tea and coffee in Japan compared to the western world. The only options are coke no sugar, sparkling water and some teas and coffees. I have used Google Translate to find which ones are best for bottled tea and coffee.

In terms of protein at meals, with lower fat cuts, that has also been a bit of a challenge. I've ordered extra meat with ramen and only eaten the meat parts, izakayas with yakitori skewers have been a great option, gyozas have been a hit so long as they're not deep fried. Plenty of places sell a main of steak or chicken breast with rice, like the chain ikinari steak.

I did bring from home a few things that I'd recommend doing if you're worried: protein bars that my weird little tummy can handle that I keep in my backpack in case I'm in a pinch,  low sugar oat museli bars and the best thing I can recommend are sugar free water flavouring sticks (made famous over on watertok), I bought the Skittles brand and add them to my water whenever I'd like a low sugar treat.

Anywho, hope this is useful for someone doing research. Thanks for having me Japan!",14,1731234999.0,JapanTravelTips,16,0.74,False

A little bit about me:
- ✨️ 30F 5'4 who is moderately obese. I haven't checked the scales recently as I'm too scared, but I'm definitely back at my heaviest which is 90kg (198lbs), if not more. My job is sedentary. 
- ✨️ Starting IF and calorie counting mostly for weight loss. My goal weight at the moment is 70kg (154lbs)  
- ✨️ Suffer from mental health, BED, BD, and ADHD, so binge eating and then feeling guilty as hell is a huge problem for me. Late night binging mostly. Also eat too much greasy junk food, and lots of Pepsi and coffee. Hardly any water. They also suspect I have PCOS.
- ✨️ I want to do this to get my life back and to feel confident within myself. I have lots of inflammation, belly and face fat, my ankles and legs hurt a lot, I'm out of breath, and I'm depressed. My clothes that once fit don't fit anymore. I'm bloated, my tummy and bowels are super sensitive, and more.

I'm so scared to do this because I don't want to disappoint myself for the 100th time. 

Game plan:
- ✨️ Fast 16:8
- ✨️ Break fast with Smoothie/banana and yoghurt/eggs/salad, etc.
- ✨️ Eat whatever is cooked for dinner
- ✨️ Try and drink at least 1ltr of water for now
- ✨️ Walk at least half an hour a day

Does this seem achievable? What foods do you eat to break your fast? I read you should eat things that are soft on your tummy. How quickly should I see a difference in my body?

《Jayce and Viktor, Piltover and Zaun: ""Rebuilding"" Relationships Through ""Separation""》

 

https://preview.redd.it/lrl78y68x10e1.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1570726d16cb39e2062feb34f551139ad7ffb07c

Many groups of characters in Arcane have a contrasting relationship. I think the group of Jayce and Viktor actually form an intertextual relationship with how Piltover and Zaun get along. Apart from the origins and identities of the two people, they are two people who have also made contributions. The development of his personal destiny in the first season also reflects this: Jayce brought economic benefits to Piltover, gained parliamentary status, and achieved worldly success; while Viktor was terminally ill, sitting in the dark, losing his right to speak, Someone around him died in an accident and he wanted to commit suicide.

Jayce saves Viktor not because Jayce is Viktor's salvation, but because the two of them are one and the same in destiny, and Viktor's survival in a narrative sense is in compliance with Jayce's wish.

The most explicit scene in the first season is when Jess puts a coffee cup with his face on the table before going on stage, blocking Viktor's figure. Viktor is the mirror image he needs to complete his narcissistic behavior.

The quarrel between the two in the second season, as Jess said, carrying the expectations of the whole city but ignoring them, seeing their friends' lives hanging by a thread but still sticking to their moral principles? He completely denied what Viktor had just said ""I should die"" and ""it killed Skye"", and Viktor was speechless again.

Suppose, as Jayce said, he stayed in the laboratory, stayed with Viktor, or let Viktor stay with him, how would things develop?

As a political pawn who has been cultivated for a long time, will the forces behind him let go easily? Even if Mel can be moved by his feelings and ideas, Mel can't protect himself when faced with Ambesa and Black Rose. Caitlin is semi-forced into the position of dictator because of her usefulness. Heimerdinger As the scientists who founded Piltover can be driven out of the center of power, Hex Energy itself is also in a frenzy.

Jess wants to do research quietly with his partner here as if he were in a paradise. How can he achieve this?

Jayce could blurt out ""abandoning the people"", but he was completely unaware that this was implying the pressure he was under for abandoning the people and choosing Viktor. Then would he think about it every day and every year in the laboratory? Did I lose the opportunity to improve the lives of the people of Piltover because I chose to stay and take care of you? Or the look in his mother's eyes that doesn't remind him of himself?

Therefore, Viktor chose to complete the separation from Jayce, no longer becoming his aphasic partner, no longer a choice for which he had to pay a price, no longer waiting and counting on his partner to wake up, and becoming an equal through separation.

Only in this way can they have the opportunity for dialogue and negotiation, and the chance to rebuild their relationship.

Only then can everyone do their own thing, instead of ""wait a moment"" or ""you have to understand me"".

Back to why the two of them formed an intertext with the Twin Cities, it is precisely because the issues in the Twin Cities are essentially the same as the negotiation mode of these two people. The more Zaun becomes attached to Pi City, waiting for Pi City to remember to manage their environment, and think of taking care of them. The wealth of the port and the peaceful and beautiful people's life are shared with them, and the more they can't wait for anything in return.

Piltover can even decide whether to bring armed forces into Zaun and place them in the streets through just a few high-level discussions. In the end, they just ""restrained"" to enter an armed Hex team, and injected more intense poisonous gas into the air where they came to survive. The scariest thing is that everything is ""reasonable"" and ""reasonable"".

This is the consequence of attachment and loss of autonomy.

For example, if the Hex flying door device with a risk of explosion was put into Zaun, did the people in Zaun agree? Do civilians get any benefit from Feimen?

Although it was not stated explicitly, for example, it might have been given to the Alchemist Baron, knowing that they would spend it all, but acquiescing to all this happening is the same as abandoning the dying compatriots.

Therefore, what Zuan needs to do to truly come back to life is: first, cut off the blood transfusion pipeline, and no longer block his own development path for the sake of immediate survival; second, maintain independence and refuse the interference of others and other wills own decision.

In the first part, Silco was doing something similar, including organizing the Alchemy Barons to form Zaun's own ruling class. Only the managers who lived among them would not even know the price. Of course, he is not absolutely correct, because he and Fandel themselves are the control group.

 

Before the release of S2, many people speculated on how Jayce and Viktor would part ways. For example, Viktor was terminally ill and had to be reformed, but Jayce objected to this, and the two broke up on bad terms.

I think the design of S2 in the main drama is quite exquisite. Jess even treated Viktor with a tolerant and generous attitude and allowed him to stay by his side in this way. He even gave up everything, returned to the laboratory, and You are together.

And Viktor said, no.

Viktor saw through the twisted controls and clever restraints behind this goodwill. Although Jayce has good intentions, as a line from another movie goes, ""Wealth makes people kind.""

Having choices, leeway, and time always makes people appear generous and magnanimous. Sadness means meditating in vast gardens and erecting tall statues in mourning throughout the city; while hungry people crawl on the ground and spend every second Death always makes people look hideous.

So before we continue to be entangled until everything is irreversible, let's separate first, until the day when we can each stand and talk openly, until the day when we can embrace each other without having to calculate the cost and sacrifice.

1. Museums: National Museum & MIA for sure. Do you think Mathaf Museum of Modern Art and Msheireb Museums are worth a visit? 

2. Souq Waqif: I found Danat Al Bahar BBQ for good fish/seafood and Abu Shariha for good falafel apparently, any recommendations for traditional Qatari food? My dad takes meat seriously so I'm trying to find a place with seriously good meat dishes 😅 

3. Msheireb: good modern coffee spots, design district, M7, walkable and pleasant for a stroll. Seems to have a beautiful mosque too. Any specific recommendations here? what are the local gems?

4. Katara cultural village: I'm not sure what it is about exactly but it looks pretty so I want to see it. For food I thought Feeh Al Aafia looks good for upscale-ish qatari cuisine, but please tell me if it's not - we like a beautiful setting, but we always prioritise food quality/authenticity, so any recommendations let me know :)

5. Others: Qatar National Library, Mina District, Qanat Quartier Canal, Vendôme mall

I have a few questions (mostly related to clothes): 

I feel like men can wear regular t-shirts and pants/jeans, is that correct? or should I ask my dad to pack something else? As for women, my usual baggy jeans/t-shirts (think Uniqlo vibe) with an open abaya over it are okay right?

Alcoholism runs in my family and I binge drank on and off starting at 27. Ive taken myself to AA and abstained for long periods. It stuck in 2022 then 2 months later my health failed. My husband consistently drank through all of it, insisting it's not a problem for him. He's changing and I can see it's from the alcohol. Our family is high stress right now and there's so much at stake. He's military. I know my available help on base, but going that route can destroy his career. He's got a TS clearance and they don't play about behavior.

 I'm in remission from stage 3b triple negative breast cancer since June of this year. I don't know if it runs in my family, and I dont know what caused it. Its cancer and i dont dwell on that. In February due to the chemo and immunotherapy, my pancreas became insufficient. After 4 hospitalizations and major stress I developed Adrenal insufficiency. (Addisons disease). I had an Adrenal insufficiency crisis in July and I almost lost my life. My kidneys were failing and my blood sodium was 113. My kidneys have since recovered (thank god). I see an endocrinologist and I take daily steroids. Since I lack cortisol, stress effects me physically. It's a real treat. My ovaries aren't producing hormones so  that classifies me with Schmidts Syndrome. 

 I'm healthy today. Im ""California sober"". I forewent anxiety and nausea meds and i do use marijuana. Im not going to debate that. It doesnt interfere and im afraid I wouldn't eat without it. I stay nauseated and Im 112 pounds (140 is my average). Even with these issues I am taking care of my home and my family. I take pride in my home. I was a barber and it's physically demanding, so I'm searching for something to do that allows me to take time off my feet (they swell). 

 I have endured heavy emotional abuse by him since I've been fighting cancer, and it happens when he drinks. The things that have happened during his drinking/hangovers have left me completely traumatized. His leadership is involved but due to his dishonesty I'm afraid. They like him. I spoke up already and was accused of being psychotic (i wasnt, i never have been). We live states away from my family and i was in the hospital alone. My husband only came once breifly, he didnt speak to any doctors. I had to prove with my medical charts that I was not delusional about my illness but I wasn't able to do that before multiple things happened that left me scarred.

 When he is sober he apologizes. When he's sober we enjoy eachother and our son together, we laugh, we joke. I want to make him happy, I cook and bake. I make his coffee. He's a foot taller than me and I love to come up and hug his waist. Maybe I'm pathetic, but life feels so short to me now.

 I'm horrified that my son is seeing all this.

Tonight he drank and made fun of my short hair and called me worthless. I don't know if he will apologize tomorrow. Sometimes he doesn't. 

I just really really wish he would stop without me having to intervene because it's going to destroy our family.

Edit: 

I'm no contact with my family, their involvement is always like gasoline on a fire.

My friends come around and I don't stay silent. I believe that's what has kept me going. ",7,1731234359.0,stopdrinking,6,1.0,False

1gnxqba,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gnxqba,Digvijay Kashish Cringe,"This is the reaction of people to the new promo.

The latest promo is so cringe inducing. Its okay if Diggy wants to be cordial with Kashish since they are in the same house. But out of everything in the world, why is Diggy discussing Kashish's interests in another man ?? Why does he care?? Are his stans actually saying that he had no other point of discussion?? 

Reddit digvijay stans going after Unnati need to wake up and smell the coffee because what she is feeling and describing is completely correct and except for some diggy bhakts here everyone on other social media platforms  can clearly see through it
