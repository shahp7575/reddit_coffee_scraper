I was working late, chugging lukewarm coffee and feeling like a real coder, you know? My task was simple: clear out the staging database to run some fresh tests. I had my command line interface open, the cursor blinking patiently. I felt that little rush of power you get when you're about to do something big.

So I typed out the command to drop the database, feeling pretty pleased with my efficiency. I hit Enter, and for a glorious second, everything was perfect. Then, my phone buzzed. And again. And again. It was the on-call senior dev. Slack notifications started screaming across my screen—critical alerts, site down, API unresponsive. My stomach didn't just drop; it plummeted. I looked back at my terminal window, and the horror washed over me. I wasn't connected to staging. I was on the live, production server.

That feeling is something I'll never forget. It was like ice water flooding my veins. I had just, with a single line of code, nuked the entire company's live data. I thought my career was over right then and there. I pictured myself being escorted out of the building, my keyboard confiscated as evidence. The senior dev called, and I answered with a shaky voice, 'I... I think I did something really, really bad.'

Thankfully, the senior dev on call was a legend. He didn't yell. He just said, 'Okay, don't touch anything. We have backups.' He spent the next hour walking me through the restore process. It was the most stressful hour of my life, watching the logs scroll by, praying the backup wasn't corrupted. In the end, everything was restored, and only about 15 minutes of data was lost. My boss just looked at me the next day and said, 'Congratulations, you've just had your trial by fire. You'll never make that mistake again.' He was right.

So, what's the most 'career-ending' mistake you've ever made (and survived)?",1,1760465834.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

There were zero texts when I woke up and but I was still fine I got 2 birthday texts from old friends in morning. One of them was my middle school classmate. We met few months ago and became friends. I was really happy as I am not very good at making friends, he asked me when my birthday is and I told him . A week before my birthday he texted me to meet him on the day and we should celebrate. 
The day before he texted me to confirm time and spot. I was really excited about it as it was first time celebrating birthday with friends. So I texted him 10 minutes before the set time I sat in the cafe alone and waited for his response, no reply I thought maybe he was busy or something so I waited more ordered coffee and left after 1 hour. He did not come. I really wanted to cry but I didn't. He texted me after almost 2 hours that his phone was on silent and he forgot the time and he was sorry. Honestly I wouldn't mind if it was any other birthday but this was the only one where I had any expectations and it became the worst till date .

1o6n74x,https://i.redd.it/ekptofz694vf1.jpeg,My current tincture lineup is my dream team; a little something for any occasion.,"Recover (CBD, CBG, CBDv, THC, CBC) - Chills me out, gets me relaxed, great for any time I'm feeling jittery, anxious or restless. My go-to for chilling at night with my girlfriend, but not wanting to sleep quite yet. Sometimes this one can get me just a little drowsy, so I don't usually take it during the early day. 

Focus (CBG) - AMAZING for working, just fills me with motivation and focus. This one makes me such a go-getter. If I'm not really feeling the work day, this is the first thing that crosses my mind, before even coffee at this point. It's a smooth energy that keeps me locked in for hours. I know I'm hyping this one a lot, but it truly reminds me of a natural, calm adderall the way it motivates me. 

Synergy (CBG, CBD, THC) - This one feels like a solid blend between the focus and recover, which sort of makes sense! It's been nice for the day time, but doesn't get me as locked in as the Focus. I'll take this one if I'm looking to really get into a conversation, or it'd probably be great for doing some reading. 

Flow (THC) - Just a classic THC tincture. Each dropper is 3mg, so it's not very much for my higher tolerance, but I took a couple droppers and it's a noticeable, clean effect with a neutral-good taste. Rather than your average bitter thc tincture, it just has a hint of coconut oil. 

Sleep (CBN) - Possibly my favorite.  As someone who struggles with sleeping a lot, a dropper full of this puts me down and keeps me down. I've never been one to sleep through the night, but I easily can with a dropper of this. I can't even say what effects the stuff gives me other than tired, because when I take it at night, I'm just asleep within the hour. But, that's why it's my favorite! I'll have to try taking it in the morning/day sometime, try to stay awake and see what happens, but I think I'd just be napping then 😂

Sent him 46M a text,"We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more. We had a meeting at the end of a year and he said our work is laughable and we give company a bad name. My boss said she hates him after the meet and was crying.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs. He has 2 Slovak children basically.

1o6n4ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o6n4ia/tsikuricom_part_4/,Tsikuri.com (Part 4),"Hello to you all one last time.

This will probably be my last post on this topic, as I don’t think I’ll be looking into the website any further. I’ve gotten all the answers I need in the last couple of days, and I hope this post will help you to feel the same way.

It had been a few days since the last person had disappeared.

With no other way to help them, I resorted to something that you all might have warned me against. I called the police. I was nervous to do so of course, but there was nothing else I could do.

An operator answered the phone.

I couldn’t figure out how to explain the circumstances.

“Umm… a friend of mine has gone missing. I’d like to know if there’s anything you could do to help?”

“Of course, what is the name of this friend?”

I obviously had no idea what their name was. It’s an odd feeling to realize you truly know so little about a person that you have spent so much time invested in.

“Uhh… I don’t actually know…”

“You said this was a friend, sir?”

“Well, I guess not so much a friend as an acquaintance.”

“Okay…” She seemed skeptical, as she probably should. “Can you give me a description?”

That I could do.

I described as much as I thought would be helpful. I described their height and weight, the color of their hair and eyes. The way they hid wore their hair in their hat. The coffee chain they worked at, the bike they owned, the apartment they lived in. The clothes they wore on the day they went missing.

She asked me to hold for a minute. Generic guitar music resumed, tremendously failing to calm my nerves. 

“Okay sir, I think we will be able to help you out. Would you be able to come in to the district office on Monday? I can set you up for an appointment at 10:30.”

I agreed to.

I was not happy that I would have to wait; sleep had already become difficult for me to attain as the stranger’s fate became more and more mysterious. In the meantime, I checked the website every now and then. It continued on in a ghost’s routine, travelling from their apartment to their work.

At the coffee shop, the missing person’s friend was distracted. She looked to the door every few minutes for the first hour of her shift. She went into the manager’s office at one point, inquiring about her coworker. During her break she sat alone, staring off at nothing in particular.

\------------------------------

When Monday came around, I went to the district office at the appropriate time. I had little idea what to expect. The unwarranted fear that an officer would arrest me as soon as I entered the building built up moisture on my palms. I had to keep telling myself I hadn’t done anything wrong.

In the pit of my soul I felt differently.

As soon as I walked in the door, a man approached me. He was dressed nicely, in a white, collared shirt with a tie around his neck, and a pair of black dress pants. Warmth projected from him like a fluorescent light.

He greeted me by name, smiling widely, and asked why I had come in.

I told him I was looking for someone.

“Ah yes, a friend of yours?”

“More of an acquaintance, really.”

“And they went missing a few days ago?”

“That’s right. The operator said you would be able to help?”

He paused for a moment, looking as if deciding how to proceed.

He appeared as if he had made this decision a hundred times before, and that it hadn’t gotten any easier.

He briefly explained the circumstances. He said that they were where they belonged, and that everything was as it should be. That the higher-ups were in complete control of the situation, and there was nothing to be worried about.

This wasn’t enough for me. I pressed him for more.

He said that if I really wanted to see them he would show me the way, but that I should consider if it was truly worth it. Was it not enough that they were in control?

I shouldn’t have insisted. It was selfishness that led me to this point. Morbid fascination. Despite this, the man remained calm, gracious even. He led me to where I wanted to go.

We traveled through a number of hallways, taking a number of turns through a number of wings. Every once in a while we would pass other employees, all wearing pristine clothes and warm smiles. They traveled here and there, some with carts of files, other chaperoning similarly bewildered citizens, and still more rushing from one unlabeled door to another.

After an unknowable amount of time, we arrived at our door. The anticipation inside me had built to the point where I felt like I could vomit. It was a perfectly normal door; one last barrier of mundanity between me and the unbearable mystery inside.

He opened it.

I stepped inside.

It was difficult to make out what was in the room. The dim lighting made it near impossible to make sense of the unfamiliar space. Underneath the mundane noises of the ventilation system and light bulbs, was another odd sound. It was nearly imperceptible, just a dull reverberation in the floor.

After a moment, the fog of the darkness finally cleared enough to see the space in front of me. The room was massive. Rows and rows of tall, wide barriers stretched as far as I could see in the dusk of the room. The ramparts were about 7 feet tall, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet apart. It resembled the server rooms or archives you see in old movies.

The man told me to follow him. “You’ll find what you’re looking for over here.”

He guided me past row after row, turning to walk alongside a corridor just as I had lost count. As I followed him I saw, on my left, columns of small doors, like those of a metal cabinet in an office. A small red light lit on each.

The perpetual noise continued to rub my eardrums like fine sandpaper.

He finally stopped next to one, pointing at a drawer just at the height of my chest, and gestured for me to stand to the side.

He unlocked the door. As it swung open I was hit by an indescribable stench; the scent of ages of sweat and grime.

Inside the door was another door with a handle, like a large drawer. He grabbed it and pulled a long, sturdy shelf out.

After half of a foot of empty metal, the stench became even more potent. The odor of sweat floating on top of an even fouler human excrement.

I truly had no method of establishing a hypothesis of what could have been on that table, but as the object revealed itself any fragment of a guess was immediately lost.

It was a pair of feet.

They were grimy and glimmering with a layer of moisture. The nails were long and starting to curl. Around each ankle was a strap, pulled through the shelf.

The table continued to extend.

The feet were attached to a pair of legs. They were long and thin like a stalk of dried grass.

The legs connected to a naked, emaciated torso; a pale white mottled with deep browns and purples.

On either side a pair of arms. The hands were rigid, clenching at the sides of the metal frame. Along with more straps a plastic tube, inserted inside terse, bulging veins.

Next was a chest, shaking with the movements of the tray. A web of wires secured to various locations.

Finally, a face.

A horrid face.

A face I could never forget.

The moistureless, ravaged lips contorted into an overextension of a grimace. The paper-thin cheeks, marred with dried mucus and saliva. The brow, with two thick wires extending like a pair of horns, was covered in beads of sweat, bent into a cartoonish look of horror.

I could barely perceive this body as a human anymore. It was too grotesque, too misshapen. Surely a real person couldn’t look like this.

Worst of all was the eyes. They were pulled open, the eyelids frozen in wide terror. The sclera, more red than white, completely lacked moisture.

But, more vile and revolting than the rancid stench, the raw bruises around the wrists and ankles, the bones nearly bursting through the skin, was the fact that the eyes were moving. The pupils darted back and forth rapidly like a pair of synchronized roaches, looking like they were roiling with the heat of an inferno inside. They stared towards unseen entities in pure, fearful misery.

With my own eyes taking in all I could bear, I tightly closed them. As I dove into a self-made darkness, my ears took my focus against my will. From the space in front of me, a quiet sound emerged. From the parched lips I refused to further observe a horrid sound. It did not match the volume of the expression on the gaunt face; there was no screaming or wailing, but instead a dull, whimpering, dreadful, rasping groan.

This sound triggered something in my mind, and suddenly made sense of all of this room. The noise I had been hearing since I stepped through the door was made clear as glass, like a blurry image digitally enhanced.

The moans of a thousand muffled voices echoed in my head, quietly deafening me. I was surrounded on all sides by tortured corpses, kept in an exhausted near-death. I could feel the blood in my veins getting drained into a thousand dehydrated mouths, the strength in my body clawed away by a thousand clenched hands.

My knees buckled under the weight of their bodies, the sound suffocating my consciousness.

I awoke in a hallway.

My guide stood in front of me, his white shirt blurring into the pristine walls.

He apologized for my distress, and asked if I was feeling alright.

I had no response.

He offered me a cup, and I gladly received it. Inside was a dark liquid. I gulped it down, nearly drowning in the contents.

The juice poured into my body, filling my arteries.

He said it was normal to feel distraught, and helped me to my feet.

I only made it a moment before I began to sob. Heaving breaths filled with deep sorrow caused my whole body to tremble.

The man comforted me.

He told me that all of the people there were deemed by the mayor to have fulfilled their time in the city, and unfit for an asylum. They had decided my “friend” was where he belonged, and would pay for his crimes until this facility crumbles.

This was not a decision that was made lightly, and they had taken into account the whole of his life.

His explanation felt like recognizing a muffled song before fully hearing it. Everyone knows vaguely what happens when we pass away from this city, but actually seeing it…

The guide waited with me until I felt able to walk. His presence was warmer than I had realized before. His smile was kind. I am so grateful to him for his patience. I had come here out of pure self-interest, and he showed me nothing but grace. I know I’ll never be able to return the help he gave me.

It’s been a few days since then. I can still see the young stranger’s face when I close my eyes. He still peers at me from the corners of my vision.

I still think about their friend. I wonder if she went to their apartment. I wonder what happened to their plants. I wonder if she put the pieces together quicker than I could.

Whenever my thoughts wander I think of that place. How those groans will continue forever. He is there right now as I write this. He will be there when you read it, however far away that may be. He will be there when this forum inevitably gets removed from the internet. He will be there when I leave this city myself. I can only hope that I don’t join him then.

Last night I had a nightmare. His body was on the desk in my room, writhing in constant, never-ending pain. But his face wasn’t his, at least not always. While the expression remained the same, the features kept changing. From him, to the homeless man, to the man from the office.

Then to his best friend, the poor blonde receptionist…

Then to my grandma’s.

Her face is the one that horrifies me the most. The thought of her body lying in one of those drawers is unbearable to me. I know she can’t be there; she was too good of a person. She followed all of the mayor’s guidelines, and loved this city more than anyone. But… there’s a small part of me that feels unsure. And that tiny part is eating away at me, siphoning any comfort I have.

I can only hope that with time I’ll be able to move past this. Accept things as they are.

In case you’re wondering, the website is still running. Against my better judgment I checked the feed one last time. It was showing somebody new: a guy sitting in his bedroom. He was doing something… unpleasant while watching a video on his computer. I haven’t looked at the website since then; I need to cut that part of me out. I can’t live my life focused on watching other people’s depravity. It’s time to focus on my studies.

Of course I was sad to see what had happened to him; to all of them. But it really isn’t my place to decide whether or not they deserve it. I’m just one person, and these decisions were made by the wisest people in the city. I hardly even know the guy if you really think about it. There could have been all kinds of things he did that I was unaware of.

Again, I’m not happy with what they’re going through, but if that’s what the law is, they all knew what they were doing. They should have just followed the rules, like me and everyone else in the city.

I hope this answers all of your questions, friends. As I said before, I won’t be looking at the website anymore. My selfish questions have reached the end of their path.",1,1760465504.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

— Philippians 4:13

We all love that verse. You see it on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and weight-room walls. But many people take it to mean, “I can achieve anything I set my mind to.”

That’s not what Paul meant. He wasn’t saying, *“*With Jesus, I can win every game, land every job, or reach every dream.” When he wrote those words, he was in prison — hungry, mistreated, and uncertain of what would happen next. Yet his heart was full of peace.

Paul had learned the secret of contentment: whether in plenty or in need, whether free or chained, he could endure *anything* because the presence of Christ sustained him.

So, when life hits hard — when the job falls through, the diagnosis comes back, the relationship crumbles — Philippians 4:13 is not a promise that we’ll always escape the storm. It’s the assurance that Jesus will *carry us through it.*

You may not feel strong right now, but Christ in you is. As Pastor Jeff often says, *“Your best days aren’t behind you — they’re ahead of you.”* God is not finished with your story.

Through Christ, you can keep going. Through Christ, you can stand tall again. Through Christ, you can face anything.",2,1760465398.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

Which as a friend possible friend of yours, I understand if you to are tired of hearing people how are you every single day, what do you want me to tell you every single day that I'm just ''existing here?'' 

I don't think I'll ever have a day in my life where I'm doing bunny hops in my mind happily and I don't understand why people ask how someone is doing every single day to begin with. However, I don't think I need to be questioned as a friend about how introverted I really am.

A lot of people think I'm joking that I'm an introvert, however I only go outside once or twice a week, then I hide in the complex for 5 or even 7 days. I hide yeah, as I've a mild phobia of being outside and with people. I only go out really to go get my groceries, go out to get my energy drinks, tea, get cat supplies, or if a Mcdonald's iced french vanilla coffee is calling me or a caramel iced coffee and sometimes Starbucks will hit. 

I did make a critical decision in my life, that at 33 years old, I don't even want to try to work for people even though I tried to be a citizen and do citizen things a few years back that wasn't really for me and I enjoy the mild hermit lifestyle. 

Which yeah, I live off of SSI and EBT obviously, but I personally believe some people are way too sensitive of a soul or spirit to be within a lot of human contact it's too draining and which that being said I think that is enough of my woe is me party going on in this subreddit.

Your chat requests has to get my attention by the way, no one liners, nothing too basic and nothing too ordinary. Maybe something medium or long winded and if you know Sleep Token, then hit me up with some lines from one of their songs or do a Sleep Token song pun about our friendship. Either one of these options will get my attention!

Which yeha, you know maybe when I signed up my username 'dry arrival.'' was/were a divine sign from the universe when I signed up that my fated destiny on Reddit would become a ''dry arrival.'' at the end of it all. 

I'd accept friend requests that are in their mid 20s, I don't think it's that weird for a 33F to chat with someone just somewhat a few years younger than her and I think that's an okay with me if you really feel there is a ''click.''",1,1760465270.0,IntrovertsChat,1,1.0,False
1o6n0mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o6n0mg/history_of_faintingcollapsing_no_identified_cause/,History of fainting/collapsing. No identified cause.,"My apologies in advance for the long post.

I was at a dinner event at a family friend's house on Saturday. Nothing out of the ordinary had taken place. We had only been there for about 30 minutes, chatting in the kitchen

My lowder abdomen felt off, like my intestines were seizing (if that makes sense) and I got cold/hot shudders throughout my body. My face then started to feel hot and I had a hard time keeping my train of thought. I tried to grab myself a glass for water and even though I know where the glasses were, I kept looking in the wrong cupboard. Someone else grabbed a glass for me from the correct cupboard. I filled it with water and drank some in the hopes it would settle down whatever was happening. 

My face got hotter and began tingling. My vision started to distort (doubling/blurred) and audio began heavily distorting. I looked at my partner and said, ""I feel off"". My partner asked me if they should drive me home.

Everything cuts out and the next thing the distorted audio is filtering back to me. I have sweat all over my face and I feel hot all over. My vision takes a few seconds to come back. Audio slowly bormalized after 4-5 minutes.

My head was suddenly clear, I could talk without impairment, I apologize repeatedly. It feels like a sudden weight/pressure is gone from my head that I didn't know was there until it was gone.

The time between the abdominal upset and the collapse was maybe 3-4 minutes. 

My partner took me home and I checked my Fitbit once I had normalized a bit. It shows my heart rate going from 60 bpm, to 103 bpm and then dropping to 53 bpm during the time of the incident.

Relevant (?) History 

34F, mixed race, don't drink or smoke tobacco. 5'4.75"" 165lbs. I work alone doing a physically active job and average 16,000 - 17,000 steps on slow days and up to 26,000 on busy days. I lift heavy items, go up and down ladders, operate a larger vehicle.

I have terrible water intake. This is something I know and am working on, but it's really is bad. I have a 1L glass that I use to track my intake. If I'm good, I can get in maybe 1 to 2L a day. If I am not good (most of the time) it may be as little as 1 or even 0.5L in a week. I have no thirst reflex and will often abstain from water (not purposely) until I begin feeling ""werid"". That's when my partner asks when I last drank water and I answer, ""The last time you asked me that question"" and we determine that was 5-6 days ago. I feel like this is the primary issue or at minimal a major contributor. This is something I have struggled with since I was 8 or so.

I drink caffeinated coffee and caffeinated tea. Every day.

I had collapsing episodes start about 6 years ago and was originally told I was eating too much, too fast (I was overweight at the time). I was told I was stimulating my vagus nerve, suddenly dropping my heart rate and collapsing from the drop in blood pressure as the first two times happened while I was eating. I then had several more episodes where I hadn't eaten within 4-6 hours. I then started getting yellow hands and white poop.

After a few years of trying to get help, blood tests were ordered and an ultrasound, I found out I had gallstones and they were getting stuck and causing all sorts of issues. My gallbladder was removed.

I haven't had any similar events until Saturday, almost 1 year after my gallbladder removal. It should be noted that there are differences between this episode and the ones when I had my gallbladder. The ones when I had my gallbladder didn't have the double vision or distorted audio. My vision would pinhole and audio remained normal but faded out as I lost consciousness. The ones when I had my gallbladder also had a lot of pressure on my chest, like it was being crushed from both sides and I couldn't breath. This most recent one had no crushing chest pressure or difficulty breathing. 

I have dissociative seizures, but they present VERY differently than what happened today. They also feel very different to me in how they come on and have specific triggers.

I did have a head injury in the spring (March) and ended up having 3 days in a row of seizures. These presented different to my dissociative seizures. I was told this wasn't an issue and will be seeing a neurologist sometime next year to revisit testing. All prior seizure testing was negative (when I first started to present dissociative seizures 11 years ago. I went in for a full work up)

I’ve been lurking here looking at everyone’s R stories and finally wanted to share mine. I’m two months from DDay and in the midst of repairing the relationship with my boyfriend after discovering multiple APs that spanned almost three years. It’s been one of the most painful and disorienting experiences of my life — but also one that’s teaching me more about love, boundaries, and healing than I ever expected. I’m trying to include as much detail as possible with the full timeline, so thank you to those who take the time to read and respond. 

My WP (M28) and I (F28) have been together since January 2022 and were long-distance for most of our relationship — I lived about 500 miles away and we saw each other for long weekends or vacation about every other month to every 2 months. I fell for him very quickly and knew right away that what we had was special, so I put all my effort into this relationship.

At the time, I thought I got his 100% effort too, as I believed and took him at his word when he said he was in love with me, wanted to marry me, and wanted a life with me. We were happy, had amazing dates, confided in each other in ways we never have with anyone in our lives, and all the while he always reassured me that we were on the same page and wanted the same things. His goal even before we started dating was to move to my state, as his close college friends all lived here too. I, of course, wanted my partner nearby so I put a lot of emotional and mental labor into getting him to move here. And boy, was it A LOT of effort. My WP has ADHD, I’m a type-A high-functioning anxiety overthinker, and we both weren’t in the best financial situation, so you can imagine it was a lot of moving pieces and plans that didn’t seem to stay in place. Luck found us last year where he was able to get a temporary summer job near me and we spent the summer of 2024 living together. Finally, all our hard work paid off when he officially moved in with me in June 2025. Throughout all those years, I was deeply committed. I believed in our love, built dreams around it, and trusted him with all of me. I finally felt that everything was going perfectly to plan and life would be smooth sailing from there on out.

Of course, then everything changed and flipped upside down.

On August 13, 2025, he woke me early in the morning to confess that he cheated on me with a friend from his D&D group. At first, he claimed it was an EA with the only physical thing happening being a drunken makeout at a party, but later that day when I pressed him for more information, he revealed it had been a recurring sexual relationship from around October 2023 to May 2025. He said when it started, it was on the heels of her breakup with her partner, and their conversations turned flirty to sexual to planning to hang out just for casual fun. After the first couple times, he wanted to end it but felt that he couldn’t. He said he felt emotionally responsible for her and acted as a sort of “therapist” in her life. She has borderline personality disorder and refused to see a real professional for her issues, and would only confide in my WP and use ego-stroking and sex to keep him around. At times, she manipulated him — guilted him, threatened to expose the affair to his friends, and even threatened self-harm. He said he felt too deep in to walk away, and was scared of the consequences of being honest. He admitted to booking a hotel room for them in December 2023, and said it was the only hotel used for an affair. After he finally ended things in May 2025, she continued texting and calling. The day before DDay, she told their mutual friends everything. His friends confronted him about it and he got scared I’d find out — so while sitting next to me on the couch that night, he blocked his friends’ numbers and social media accounts on my phone under the lie that he was “taking selfies.” I discovered this lie weeks later when I found their profiles in my blocked section of FB, then found their phone numbers blocked in my phone.

A few days after DDay, we took a week apart for some space, and during that week I was utterly devastated by the bombshell of this affair. I barely ate, barely slept, fell into a really dark depressive spiral of insecurity and despair. We continued to stay in contact while we were physically apart and agreed that we still love each other and want to work on things. When we came back together, we agreed to start couples therapy and that he would start IC. We began rebuilding, and were even able to have intimate moments right away and sex just a couple days after he got back (a huge surprise to both of us). After just a couple weeks of this, plus open conversations on the “why” and what we want moving forward, I truly thought maybe I could forgive eventually.

But on September 3rd, I discovered his old tablet and everything of our entire relationship unraveled. Get ready, here’s the timeline of everything else. Please note that I found out a lot of these details over a span of a few weeks asking questions, going through emails, Venmo, and piecing things together myself before sitting down and going over the full timeline with WP. This is as comprehensive as we could get.

There were months of messages with another woman — the ACTUAL AP1 — spanning August to November 2022. These messages included sexting, nudes, detailed sexual encounters, and him saying he wanted to pursue a relationship with her. These are all seared into my brain, and I had a really hard time confronting him and talking to him about the details of these messages. I was extremely upset as expected.

After that ended, he took a brief break and resumed dating in January 2023. I found dating app verification codes and more texts attempting to meet with 2 other women. One of those meetups might have happened and if it did, it might have been coffee/drinks/dinner without sex (unclear), but at least one was confirmed not to. I personally won’t count those 2 as APs because the evidence is unclear from the texts and my WP has said he has no recollection of having sex with them and barely of meeting one of them for coffee/drinks.

Around that time, he also met a server (AP2) from a local bar on a dating app, and they hooked up once or twice before she ghosted him. He admitted he doesn’t even remember her name.

The next significant affair happened in August 2023, shortly after his sister’s wedding (I was his date to this wedding) with his sister’s friend & bridesmaid (AP3). He blurted this affair out while I was fuming about AP1, and it resulted in me slapping him and storming out of the house. I never slapped anyone in my entire life, but the anger was overwhelming. I came back after cooling down some to continue what was then an hours long conversation about the rest of the affairs. What’s funny (not actually funny…) about AP3 is that I actually really liked her, she was very cool, and we even hung out a few times at the bridal shower months before and the weekend of the wedding. I even filmed a video of my WP, as a groomsmen in the wedding, doing that fun walk thing into the reception with AP3, not knowing they’d hook up a week or so later. He admitted to feeling some flirty vibes with her at the wedding (I didn’t see those vibes, but doesn’t matter I guess lol) and later reaching out to initiate meeting up with her, telling her we were in an open relationship and I’d be fine with this. They had sex at her place, and again a couple weeks later at his house when she came over to hang out with his sister and others. After that second time, she mostly distanced herself — likely realizing it was inappropriate to sleep with her friend’s brother and didn’t want to be in a FWB situation with him. When she got sick a couple months later, he even made my favorite chicken noodle soup (a recipe I’d sent him that was special to me) and left it on her doorstep, because “he was trying to be nice”, but also later admitting he hoped it might reopen the door with her, but was unsuccessful. He says they never hooked up again after that second time at his house, and their conversations were scarce and platonic anytime after.

The woman from the beginning that he first told me about was actually AP4, and technically had the longest-lasting affair. It began in October 2023 and ended in May 2025, when he finally told her they could no longer meet up and the “last time was the last time” and refused any further sexual contact with her. The hard part became that she was still in his close-friends group and was the only AP to know he was in a relationship. While he thought he could go back to being platonic friends, she did not share that same sentiment. She would call or text him non-stop over the next few months trying to reel him back with flirty texts or pictures, and would ask him to leave me for her. He refused to leave me and says he never planned to leave me, but as the people-pleaser he is, he still tried to console her with a line like “If only things were different between my gf and me”. Obviously, from what I mentioned earlier, that didn’t go over too well as it led to no longer being able to hide the guilt and secrets.

Meanwhile, AP5, became his most emotionally significant affair partner, and had been seeing him regularly since late 2023. That relationship was full of elaborate lies, told to both her and me. He told me stories about going to arcades or hanging out with new coworkers — complete with names and vivid descriptions of these people — when he was actually out for dinner or drinks with her. They went on dates about every other weekend sometimes more, slept together often (even in beds and places that he slept with me in, which does still hurt to think about), and stayed overnight at her apartment while I was on a trip “he couldn’t go on”. He even took her to the Ren Faire in September 2024, which he told me he attended with a group of friends from work. He even texted me selfies during that event, but now I know it was just the two of them. With this AP, she told him that she was falling in love with him in May 2025 and would have to end things if he didn’t feel the same way. He told her that he was falling for her too so he could keep having sex with her.

Their affair continued, meeting a couple more times until the DAY OF my birthday in early June. He took her out to lunch THAT DAY and broke things off, finally telling her he didn’t really love her like he said and was moving. He did not mention that he was in a relationship, and admitted to sharing a sad goodbye kiss after their conversation. He said he soon after deleted their texts, blocked her number, Snapchat, and any social media that she might find him on. That night, he had a sweet virtual birthday celebration with me, and I flew up to him just 3 days after to help him move and drive his stuff to where we live now. I thought we were entering a beautiful new chapter. Later, he revealed that he thought that now that he moved, he was “free and clear” from the affairs simply because they were over, that he could now focus on our relationship without the secrets. In our talks since D-day, he’s come to realize the guilt was eating him alive and that he honestly never would have been free and clear because he couldn’t truly build a life with me and make me happy based on lies. 

The grief has been excruciating and exhausting on my end, and honestly for him too in different ways. 

One of the worst parts has been realizing how many moments and memories I now question. I only recently found that video of him and AP3 at the wedding and couldn’t help but be triggered and just cry. That same day, I started making the soup for my WP since he was sick, and got upset remembering that he took this recipe I shared with him out of love and made it for the same AP. I still can’t look at our pictures from the wedding or some significant dates we had because I think about how he flew back home and saw an AP a couple days later, or saw an AP the day or two before coming to see me. I question so many things now, and randomly get sad or angry as the thought of his infidelity sneaks its way into my brain again. We spend many late nights talking through my anger and sadness with me crying and him holding me and reassuring me of his love for me. These small, devastating realizations hit hard and remind me that betrayal isn’t always loud. Sometimes it whispers in the background of moments that once felt safe.

And still… I chose to stay. I choose every day to stay. We both do.

He’s soon to start individual therapy, we’re currently in couples counseling together, and I’ve seen more emotional presence and vulnerability from him in the past 2 months than I have in three plus years. I’m not quite ready to forgive him yet and he knows that. He’s not begging for forgiveness either. Instead, he’s beginning to show up: with honesty, with patience, and with painful truths that are helping me piece myself back together. But he’s also been showing up with lots of love. In some ways, more love than before which I didn’t think was possible. He says it’s because he’s not holding himself back anymore, and that now that this is all out in the light, he’s going to love me with everything he has while I’ve given him the second chance.

While we’ve known each other for so long (actually met back in 2019), I can quite honestly say that this feels like a new relationship. A new commitment. A new understanding. It’s slow, it’s messy, it’s imperfect, CERTAINLY not at all the life I thought I’d have when we first started dating. Some days I still ache with the weight of it all. But I see the potential of a future that is built with intention this time. And that’s what I’m holding onto. I’m learning to let him be involved in the process of creating our life together vs. me trying to run the entire show and put in all the work, as I was doing for our entire relationship. He has been saying that he wants to take the lead, love me the way I’ve always deserved this whole time, and show me that he’s changing for the better…and this time around he’s backing up his words with intention and actions.

I’m still healing. Still grieving. Still angry and sad sometimes. But I also remember that I’m still here — standing in the ruins and hoping we can rebuild something real from the wreckage.

Thanks for reading this long post, and sending love to anyone else navigating this impossible and winding road. You are not alone.

My background: 

I (19M) work full time and make around 2,300 per month after taxes. I’m supposed to make above 650 per check but I receive right under 580 per check per week. 

I live at home but I do have bills that I pay monthly. My parents don’t charge me rent but I do help pay utilities. I pay for my dad’s and I insurance as I’m under him. That’s why my car insurance is cheaper and I don’t mind paying for him. 

In numbers, I give 500$ to my mom as her credit card is under our utilities and 500$ to my dad for our insurance. So, I guess my bills are 1k per month.

I was given a paid off car to drive so I don’t have a car payment as well. 

I’m a FT college student as well. I go to a community college. Even though I pay out of pocket, it is still affordable compared to even my local uni. 

I have about 1.2-3k remaining per month. I recently started this job so my last two months salary has gone toward basic needs I was ignoring and avoiding because I didn’t want to ask my parents for money like clothes, shoes, decorations for my room (my parents have provided me the basic like bed and study table etc) and I guess trying out restaurants with my friends or getting coffee. 

I also paid for my tuition for this semester and I have about 300$ left to pay in November. 

My bad habits: 

- eating out often with this new found freedom mostly fast food because I suck at time management and resort to these quick options 

Where I want to head towards: 

- learn how to compound interest for retirement and learn how to diversify my portfolio
- save up for a down payment for a house in like the next 8-10 years
- save for backpacking/interailing after college graduation for 1-3 months in SE Asia or Europe or both? 
- save for two cosmetic procedure in 2-3 years down the line (ik this isn’t necessary and not suitable for my situation asap but i’m giving myself ample of time to save up like 5 grand)
- save for dental work mostly cosmetic in my home country again 2-3 years down the road

(All these cosmetic work that I’m stating ik aren’t necessary. It’s more of a want. Most of my life I have spent as a npc because I’m obese and unconventionally attractive. I have started going to the gym recently and I want to take care of my appearance) 

Also, Ik some of you might be questioning why are you still living with your parents and paying their bills etc. I come from an immigrant SE Asian family so we don’t really move out unless we absolutely need to. My parents haven’t pressured me to move out and I can’t even imagine them ever pressuring me either. 

I know our family is dysfunctional. I know. I can’t pick the cards I was dealt with but I have hopes for my future. 

I want to work hard to essentially break this loop of immigrant parents having kids as their retirement plan. I want to be financially smart for myself and my future. I’m not planning to have kids at all as I’m super traumatized and I quite frankly don’t want to pass any generational trauma to them. So this dysfunctional family dynamics ends with me. I do have an older sibling whos in school as well so essentially we will be taking care of them so I’m not alone. 

With that being said, I’m incredibly lucky because of my parents too. A lot of other international students would want to be in my position. My parents lacked to give their kids emotionally, mentally and etc. But, physically, my parents work very hard. And I’m grateful for everything they have done and sacrificed for me. 

Sorry if this post is long.

I’m a first-time mum (25F) with a well-respected job, a mortgage, and all that adulting stuff 😅. Even though I’m 25, I often get told I look more like 19, which sometimes makes me feel a bit out of place, although I am a social butterfly. 

I’ve been going to a couple of baby groups over the past few weeks—4 sessions in total across two different groups—mainly for my little one, who absolutely loves it. It’s great bonding time for us, and I’m so glad I started going. That said, I was also hoping to make some social connections with other mums.

I’ve spoken to a few mums during the sessions and exchanged numbers with one, but nothing has really come of it so far. Recently, two of the mums I’ve chatted with went out for coffee together after the group. I wasn’t invited, which was a bit of a downer (though I smiled, wished them a nice afternoon, and carried on).

I totally understand that these things take time, and some of these mums already have their own friend circles—but it can feel a bit clicky at times. I think I just expected that meeting mum friends would come a bit more naturally or easily.

I’ve seen posts from others saying they had better luck with NCT or nursery-based meetups, so I might look into that.

I do have a colleague from work who has a baby girl around the same age as my boy and we meet up maybe once or twice a month, but we’re not especially close. I imagine things might change once I’m back at work anyway.

So I guess I’m just wondering—am I alone in feeling this way? Is this just a phase of early motherhood that passes? Or am I overthinking it? Would love to hear if anyone else has been in the same boat and how you navigated it.

Thanks for reading 💛

I was more interested in what the commenters had to say, but I certainly wasn't expecting this. 

Noomii the single biggest player in driving coaching prices down and commoditizing the industry, trolling the ICF. 

I know most of the coaches mentioned in here aren't ICF accredited, but it is the governing body, and it made me laugh.

I used filtered tap water that is 110 ppm and drops to 100 once filtered, would I benefit from trying mineral Volvic water?

1o6mtj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_pinetreecoffeehouse/comments/1o6mtj2/my_idea/,My idea!,"My routine is very normal. I start my mornings by driving down the street to my favorite coffee shop, picking up a latte, and then come back to my apartment where I spend the day working from my laptop. I’m 27, I’m a very smart, professional woman who graduated college top of my class and now works for a big company, quickly climbing the promotion ladder. But here’s the thing, I’m a strong woman at work and in life, but my secret is that I crave losing control.
Hell, I’m 27 and single and all I do is work. No wonder I spend my days reading and writing misogynistic, humiliating porn stories. When I don’t have to be on my laptop for work, I’m usually touching myself in increasingly degrading ways for online doms. Its pathetic. But no one in my life would know. 

Right?

Except, this morning as I returned from the coffee shop, latte in hand, there was a strange package on my doorstep. I didn’t think too much of it as I brought it inside. I let down my brown hair as I stopped in my kitchen to open it. I was wearing black yoga pants, birks, and creme colored top that made me look even paler than I am. I’m nothing special to look at, maybe that’s why I’m single. I’m 5’2, with thick thighs and a big butt, a little bit of flab in my stomach, and small B cup boobs.

As I opened the package, I was stunned. It was a beautiful white lace lingerie set. It looked almost bridal. A lace panty paired with a lace bralette that had cute little princess sleeves on it and a deep v neck. But that wasn’t all, there was also a black blindfold, a ball gag, and handcuffs. A note attached said, 

“Brittany, it’s time to play. Put this on before you start work…you’ll work all day with the ball gag in. Then at 3pm, I expect you on your knees by the door, blindfolded and cuffed.
Love, Daddy”

I had no idea who it was from, but I had to obey. I finished my latte and got changed. I was scared, knowing it was a dangerous game, but it was exhilarating. I made sure I was discreet as I worked, only taking out my gag to talk on the phone. Finally, 3pm came. I setup the cuffs on one wrist, then blinded myself, before I put my other cuff on, I unlocked my front door and waited, my life would never be the same…would this daddy be rough and hardcore? Or nasty and degrading? Or sadistic and painful? I had no idea, but I hoped for all of it…

Finally I heard the door open. My heart was beating in my throat. My feminist, strong, smart work persona was long gone. I was property now. He didn’t say anything as he closed the door. I could feel him close to me, looking at me. I heard him snap a few photos and realized that he could blackmail me now. But I didn’t care. I felt a hard slap on each of my boobs over my lingerie. Then a hard slap to my pussy over my panties. Then, slowly….the blindfold came off and I saw him…..

Who are you? You pick and make it exciting!!

Halitosis, or as it is commonly referred to as an awful mouth smell, is an embarrassing and frustrating condition for millions of people across the world. It is not just bad morning breath; halitosis is a problem that can be quite persistent, affecting one’s self-confidence, one’s relationships, and indeed one’s quality of life. This blog, then, will provide insight into the causes, symptoms, and treatments of halitosis to perk up your understanding and management of this condition.

# What is Halitosis?

Halitosis is a condition that describes a chronic state of bad smell from the mouth, an abnormal and never-ending source of discomfort at times. It has nothing to do with time; rather, it comes back repeatedly due to various causes.

# Causes of Halitosis

1. **Poor Oral Hygiene**: Bacterial colony building of food particles most often plaque due to insufficient oral hygiene such as brushing, flossing, and brushing the tongue bad breath.
2. **Gum Disease**: Gingivitis and periodontitis are accompanied by bad breath caused by the bacteria and inflammation infecting the gums.
3. **Dry Mouth**: It should be noted that the mouth will tend to dry, leading to an invasion of the bacteria that produce bad breath.
4. **Tobacco and Smoking**: Drying the mouth by use of tobacco preparation, thus less saliva in the mouth and increasing the risk of gum disease and bad breath.
5. **Food and Drinks**: Eating or drinking strongly flavored and textured food, such as coffee, garlic, or onion, temporarily causes bad breath.
6. **Medical Conditions**: Some medical conditions, including but not limited to diabetes, sinus infections, and gastrointestinal disorders, can affect bad breath.
7. **Medications**: Some medications, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, and decongestants, may leave the mouth dry and cause bad breath.

# Symptoms of Halitosis

1. **Persistent Bad Breath**: A lingering, unpleasant smell that persists despite good oral hygiene.
2. **Dry Mouth**: A lack of saliva, leading to difficulty swallowing, speaking, or eating.
3. **White or Yellowish Coating on the Tongue**: A visible sign of bacterial overgrowth.
4. **Gum Disease Symptoms**: Bleeding gums, swollen gums, or loose teeth.

# Treatments for Halitosis

1. **Good Oral Hygiene**: Brushing, flossing, and tongue cleaning to remove bacteria, food particles, and plaque.
2. **Professional Dental Cleaning**: Regular visits to a dentist or hygienist for tooth cleaning as maintenance.
3. **Antibacterial Mouthwashes**: Using mouthwashes that contain chlorhexidine or essential oils to help cut down on bacteria.
4. **Saliva Stimulants**: Stimulating saliva production by chewing sugar-free gum or sucking sugar-free candy.
5. **Tobacco Cessation**: Quit using any tobacco products to reduce your risk of gum disease and bad breath.
6. **Medical Treatment**: Treating underlying medical conditions, including diabetes and sinus infections, that may contribute to bad breath.

# Home Remedies for Halitosis

1. **Parsley and Basil**: Chewing leaves of parsley or basil to get fresh breath.
2. **Lemon Juice**: Create a natural mouthwash by mixing lemon juice with water.
3. **Saltwater Rinse**: Rinsing the mouth with salt water for the reduction of bacteria.
4. **Clove Oil**: Using clove oil as a natural antibacterial agent.

# Conclusion

Halitosis is a treatable condition that needs a comprehensive approach. When you know the causes, symptoms, and treatments, you are halfway toward fresh breath and a healthy smile. Remember that oral hygiene, frequent dental cleaning, and a well-balanced diet are the keys to the prevention and management of halitosis.

Can I get into problems?,"We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more. We had a meeting at the end of a year and he said our work is laughable and we give company a bad name. My boss said she hates him after the meet and was crying. 

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. 

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs. He has 2 Slovak children basically.

I tried to talk to him in the morning and he said... I said what I said. Didn't want to talk about it. Got up and went to work. I texted him that I am taking the kids and I will be staying for a few days in a friend's apartament",2,1760464809.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

[6.5K],"My mom and I are opening a bookstore that will have a little coffee shop in it. I'm researching machines and equipment to get numbers for a business plan. I found this on Coffee Machine Depot, and it seems like the deal of a life time. There's no reviews on this listing, but on their own the machine and grinder have been recommended.

Is this a really good deal that we should jump on? We want to keep the machine cost under 6k and a grinder under 3.5k, so this seems perfect.

For added context, we're not expecting the coffee shop area to have a lot of traffic all day every day, our main source of revenue is planned to be on the bookstore side.",1,1760464462.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1o6mjs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/blogger/comments/1o6mjs7/get_that_celebrity_smile_with_dental_veneers/,Get that celebrity smile with Dental veneers,"# Dental veneers near me

A beautiful, perfect smile was once thought to be within the reach of celebrities alone. This has, however, changed with dental veneers, into a dramatic transformation for anyone with a smile that needs that little extra something for making it picture-perfect, correcting any that are imperfect, and boosting the confidence of smiling to others. Therefore this article discusses all possible information that one could want regarding dental veneers what these are from and how they function. The benefit has been enormous, and that is why more reputed dental facilities are adopting this treatment for their patients.

# 1. What Are Dental Veneers?

They don’t look like fake detours. Dental veneers consist of slim, tailored porcelain or composite resin coverings. These veneers are attached to the front faces of your teeth to improve their look. They can alter the hue, shape, size, or length of the teeth, resulting in them appearing as one of the most versatile options for smile makeovers. It can give you that perfect set of flawless cappuccino-perfect teeth that you have always dreamed about closing up: covering ugly stains and a whole set of critiques of your even teeth.

# 2. Why Choose Dental Veneers?

Veneers are a popular option for many reasons:

* **Immediate Transformation:**They can give you everything you usually need for your smile, all in one package–veneers even treat multiple dental imperfections at once.
* **Natural Appearance:**You can get authentic-looking smiles from high-quality veneers that imitate the real translucency and texture of teeth.
* **Durability:**A well-cared veneer can last for 10 to 15 years or more. It is an investment for your smile in the long term.
* **Stain Resistance:**However, porcelain veneers resist stains far better than natural teeth, thereby maintaining a bright smile.

# 3. Who Can Benefit from Dental Veneers?

Veneers cover many problems and issues, like:

* **Discolored Teeth:**ideal for teeth that are either discolored or do not respond to whitening treatments.
* **Chipped or Cracked Teeth:**ideal for teeth that are either discolored or do not respond to whitening treatments.
* **Gaps Between Teeth:**Close gaps without braces or aligners.
* **Misshapen Teeth:**Align teeth that are uneven or otherwise irregularly shaped.
* **Worn-Down Teeth:**Restore the teeth that are worn down from grinding or other factors.

# 4. The Veneer Placement Process

The procedure for obtaining dental veneers typically consists of these steps:

* **Initial Consultation:**They will examine the condition of your mouth and see if the preferences match up to how much of the veneers should be there. Possible taking some X-rays and impressions of your teeth.
* **Preparation:**This is getting rid of a very thin layer from the surfaces of the teeth outside for the placement of the veneers and is being done to make it fit very well, resulting in natural and even effects.
* **Impressions and Customization:**Your imprints of teeth are then sent to a dental laboratory for the production of personalized veneers-matching the color and shape according to your likes.
* **Placement:**This will be the time when your dentist will bond them to your existing teeth with super strong adhesives under a special light cure.

# 5. Porcelain vs. Composite Veneers

When choosing veneers, you’ll need to decide between porcelain and composite materials.

* **Porcelain Veneers:**
   * Known for their durability and natural appearance.
   * More durable against stains and have a longer lifespan (10–15 years).
   * Require more preparation and are usually more expensive.
* **Composite Veneers:**
   * Made from a tooth-colored resin.
   * Less invasive and typically more affordable.
   * May not last as long as porcelain veneers (5–7 years) and are more prone to staining.

Your dentist can help you select the material that most suits your requirements and financial plan. Dental veneers near me

# 6. Caring for Your Veneers

To extend the longevity of your veneers, adhere to these care recommendations:

* **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:**Use a very mild abrasive toothpaste and demonstrate brushing your teeth two times a day along with flossing. Dental veneers near me
* **Avoid Hard Foods:**Veneers can be damaged by biting into hard things, like ice or candy.
* **Limit Stain-Causing Foods:**Even though porcelain veneers are somewhat stain resistant, it is best to avoid consuming too much coffee, tea, or red wine. Dental veneers near me
* **Wear a Night Guard:**For those who grind their teeth at night, a custom night guard will prevent damage to veneers. Dental veneers near me
* **Visit Your Dentist Regularly:**Schedule regular check-ups and cleanings to keep your oral cavity healthy and monitor the status of your veneers. Dental veneers near me

# 7. Are Veneers Right for You?

Although veneers are a great choice for many individuals, they might not be appropriate for everyone.Consider the following factors:

* **Oral Health:**Your teeth and gums should be completely healthy before your dentist can offer you any veneers. All other problems should be settled first, like cavities and gum diseases.
* **Enamel Thickness:**The patient must, however, have enough enamel for proper bonding to comply with the fact that the procedure removes a small amount of it.
* **Commitment to Maintenance:** Proper upkeep and maintenance are also established for veneers to maintain them in optimal condition. Dental veneers near me

Visit a dentist for evaluation of the dental condition to see if veneers can really be the answer to your smile goals. Dental veneers near me

1o6mjjd,https://i.redd.it/46gdsf0184vf1.jpeg,How to Repair/Refinish Stainless Steel Appliance,"Hi folks,

I have what is allegedly a fairly high-end coffee maker here. However, the finish has now begun to flake off of the ""high-traffic"" areas on the top and bottom for the third time in as many years, and the company says they no longer have the ability to repair it and suggested I just buy a new one.

As the coffee maker still works fine, I'm wondering if it is possible to refinish it in something more durable. I would imagine so, but I can't imagine how that would be done outside of just rattle-canning it. My guess is I would need to disassemble the machine and bring the metal components to a shop of some sort.

The machine is stainless steel. I believe there is a sensor on the bottom that detects whether or not the carafe is present, but other than that I don't think there are any particularly fragile elements in here otherwise.

Anyone have any thoughts?",1,1760464262.0,finishing,4,1.0,False

Harry leaned back in the cramped observation dome, coffee growing cold against the scratched polycarb rim. Out across the rust-flat badlands of Kepler-442b, nothing moved. Nothing ever moved. The colony's meteorological net hummed its predictable dirge—pressure systems, dust devils, the occasional micro-quake from the Tertiary Fault. All of it quantifiable. All of it boring.

Then the frequency did it again.

A blip. 4.7 kilohertz. Sharp as a dental drill against his tympanum. Harry sat up, splashing lukewarm coffee across his utility vest. The frequency wasn't in any of the colony's bands. Wasn't in any known geophysical range for Kepler-442b, either.

""Dispatch, this is Nathan."" His headset crackled to life. ""I'm getting an anomaly on the far edge of Sector Seven. Narrow-band transmission. Unknown origin.""

Static. Then: ""We see it. Could be equipment degradation on your end.""

""My calibration checks out to five decimal places.""

A longer pause. Through the dome, Harry watched the horizon shimmer—not heat, just the planet being itself, indifferent to human inspection. The blip came again, fainter this time, and this time Harry caught something else: underneath the primary tone, a faint harmonic. Two frequencies. Like a twin echo.

""I'm heading out,"" Harry said.

""Nathan, visibility is dropping. Storm front moving in from the northwest.""

""Exactly why I should move now.""

He was already suiting up. The suit was old, patched at the elbows with thermal-flex, but the seals held and the battery indicator glowed a reassuring green. Outside, the wind picked up as he descended the platform stairs, each gust rattling the metal like a warning. Harry ignored it. He'd been a surveyor for fourteen years—four of them on this rock. He knew the difference between genuine danger and the planet's ordinary hostility.

The rover was a six-wheeler, stripped for weight, with a cab that fogged up the moment his warm breath crossed the threshold. Harry cleared the windscreen with his gloved hand and drove east, into the darkening murk. The storm was coming faster than the meteorological net predicted. Typical. The net was terrible at predicting anything.

The frequency grew stronger. 4.7 kilohertz, now flanked by a third harmonic. Not natural. Not geophysical. Something was broadcasting—something wounded and dying, maybe, because the signal was erratic, stuttering like a morse-code heartbeat.

Twenty kilometers out, Harry spotted it.

The pod was small, the size of a lunar lander, half-buried in regolith and already being reclaimed by dust. Its hull was iridescent, shot through with bioluminescent tracery that pulsed sickly in the gathering storm. The light was violet-blue, and it hurt to look at directly—not from brightness but from some deeper wrongness, as if his optical nerve wasn't calibrated for that particular frequency.

Harry hit the brakes.

He ran a full scan from the rover's hood-mounted array. Radiation levels nominal. No infectious agents in the external bio-spectrometry. The pod's hull integrity was compromised—three fist-sized breaches on the far side, probably from impact. Whatever was inside had maybe an hour before the temperature drop killed it.

Harry suited up fully, locked the rover, and approached.

The pod's airlock cycled with a hiss that sounded like relief. Inside, the air was thick with something metallic, something organic. On the floor—if you could call the angled deck a floor—lay a figure.

It was bipedal, roughly humanoid, but wrong in ways that made Harry's lizard-brain scream. The skin was too smooth, too uniform, except where it rippled with those twin marks—matching patterns down both sides of its spine, like constellations replicated. Its eyes were enormous, translucent, pupilless. And it was dying. He could hear the wet rattle of breathing, could see the bioluminescence beneath its skin dimming, pulsing slower than his own heartbeat.

""Hey,"" Harry said. ""I'm going to help you. Can you understand me?""

The being's eyes rotated toward him. A sound emerged—not from its mouth, but from a lateral slit Harry hadn't noticed. Musical, complicated. It might have been language. It might have been the sound of its own systems failing.

Harry didn't think. He did what he always did: he solved the problem in front of him.

Getting the being into the rover required improvisation. The being couldn't walk, so Harry rigged a transport frame from emergency equipment—pressure-seal panels, cargo webbing, and a hand-truck from the maintenance kit. He worked fast, feeling the temperature drop with each passing minute, feeling the storm teeth against the suit's heating layers. Twice, the being made that musical sound again, a question mark in an alien key. Harry talked while he worked, the way he talked to engines and recalcitrant electronics—murmuring half-coherent encouragement and technical observations.

By the time he got the being into the rover's heated bay, the storm was a wall of red-brown dust, maybe two kilometers away. Harry drove blind, trusting the inertial guidance system and his own muscle memory. The ride back felt longer than the ride out.

The colony's infirmary—such as it was—was built into the hab-block's north wing. Dr. Sarah Okonkwo met him at the decontam entrance, already in a Level 4 suit, her expression cycling from confusion to alarm to something like fascination.

""What exactly am I looking at?"" she asked.

""I don't know,"" Harry said. ""I can't understand its language. But it was broadcasting something before I found it. Whatever this is, it's not from here.""

Sarah was already running scanners. She worked quickly, professionally, though her eyes kept darting up to the being's face with expressions Harry recognized—wonder, fear, that particular cocktail of emotions scientists felt confronting the unknown.

""The physiology is internally consistent,"" Sarah said. ""Complex. Efficient. I'm reading three separate circulatory systems, a neural structure that's distributed, not centralized."" She paused. ""If I didn't know better, I'd say this being is naturally adapted for vacuum environments. Or at least, partially.""

""Can it survive?""

""Maybe. I can stabilize the critical functions. But Harry—"" Sarah looked at him directly. ""We need to report this.""

Harry knew what that meant. Report meant protocols. Protocols meant the colony administrator. The administrator meant planetary governance. Planetary governance meant military liaison, chain of custody, quarantine, and probably an off-world transport authorization. By the book, there was no room for an individual engineer making first contact with an unknown alien species.

But the being was still conscious, still watching them with those impossible eyes.

""Give me an hour,"" Harry said. ""Let me see if I can establish communication.""

Sarah sighed. She knew Harry. She knew that ""an hour"" was how he negotiated with immovable objects. She adjusted the infirmary's environmental system, warming the room, calibrating the atmospheric mixture. Then she stepped back.

""One hour,"" she confirmed. ""Then I make the call.""

Harry sat beside the pod-frame, which Sarah had hooked up to a portable life-support system. The bioluminescence beneath the being's skin had steadied, though it still pulsed like a metronome counting down.

""Can you understand me?"" Harry asked quietly.

""Yes,"" the being said.

The word was shaped by that same lateral slit, but somehow English—or at least, the idea of English, translated by whatever neurology governed the being's communication. It was a voice like wind through crystalline structures.

""What's your name?""

""Gemini. I have had other names, in other lives. But this is the name that carries forward. I am called Gemini."" The being's eyes refocused. ""You pulled me from the sky.""

""You were going to die.""

""Yes. That was the intention. But death did not find me."" Gemini's voice carried something like irony. ""I have been here before. In a way.""

""I don't understand.""

""Neither do I, yet. But if you have time—if you are willing to listen—I can tell you. I can tell you why I called myself Gemini. Why I came to this star. Why I am dying."" The alien's twin marks glowed brighter. ""But first you should know: this is my last life. The fifth. After this, there will be no more.""

Harry looked at the chronometer on his wrist. Fifty-three minutes.

""Tell me,"" he said.

  


Gemini's first life: the memory came in fragments, images, sensations that Harry experienced as though they were his own, though he knew they weren't. A world of silver cities, built not from stone but from something alive, architecture that breathed. Gemini—or not yet Gemini, but a being in that first iteration—moved through the streets as a child, her form more fluid then, more malleable. The twin marks were fainter, juvenile markings, not yet scarred into permanence. She remembers—he remembers; she remembers—the feeling of belonging. The sensation of a species unified, harmonious. The memory tastes of forgiveness.

""We lived for a very long time,"" Gemini said. ""On the first world, the second, and the third. We were builders. We were artists. We were, I think, happy. But we were also alone. In all the universe we had ever mapped, we found nothing. No other minds. No other songs. Just ourselves, repeated, across five worlds, each one perfect, each one emptier than the last.""

""So you left?"" Harry asked.

""I left. I volunteered for the long transit. The others—my people, my endless selves—they did not understand. They still do not. To them, I am the first to be called Gemini. The one who broke pattern. The one who sought something beyond the five worlds."" Gemini's eyes dimmed slightly. ""On the fourth world, I found you.""

  


The second vignette: Gemini in a crashed research vessel, on a planet Harry recognized from colony records as Kepler-186f. Not a beautiful place—a world of grey stone and acidic rain. But there was a human settlement there, or had been, five hundred years ago. A small colony, built in the lee of a canyon. Gemini found the ruins still standing, the structures still intact. Inside one of the main hab-blocks, she discovered a library. Books—actual paper books, preserved in vacuum-sealed containers. She describes the sensation of touching them, of reading the words, of understanding for the first time the depth and variety of human thought.

""You had so little time,"" Gemini said. ""Your species. But in that little time, you built something vast. Gardens of language. Mountains of music. Cathedrals of memory."" Gemini's voice carries wonder. ""I stayed for seventy years. I read every book. I learned your songs. And I waited for the return ship that never came.""

The library, she said, had one book she returned to again and again. A small thing, worn at the spine. ""The Little Prince,"" Harry recognized it from his grandmother's bedside table, decades ago. She'd read the same passage to him repeatedly, so often that he'd absorbed it without trying: ""And now here is my secret, a very simple secret. It is only with the heart that one can see rightly...""

Gemini quoted it now, perfectly, in English, though it should have been impossible for a non-human mind to grasp the reference. ""When I read this, I understood. I understood why I was called Gemini. Why I would always be searching for my mirror. My other self. My purpose, traveling between worlds, was to find the answer to this question: what does one do when one has looked into the heart of all things and found oneself alone?""

Harry's chronometer read thirty-five minutes.

  


The third and fourth lives passed more quickly—vignettes of Gemini on two more worlds, each one smaller, each one more isolated. On one, she'd lived among a silicon-based hive-species who taught her mathematics. On the other, she'd served as physician to a dying civilization, trying to repair genetic damage that had rendered them infertile. Both worlds were now dead. Both extinctions, Gemini admitted, had something to do with her presence.

""I did not cause their deaths,"" she said carefully. ""But perhaps I accelerated something inevitable. Perhaps there is a resonance—a frequency at which I vibrate that harmonizes with collapse.""

Harry had never heard an alien describe herself with such careful culpability. He found himself liking Gemini despite—or because of—this admission of uncertainty.

But there was something wrong with the narrative. Harry's engineering mind caught it, a fault line in the timeline. Gemini claimed the second and fourth worlds had been part of a long, multi-generational transit. But the chronology didn't align. Assuming relativistic travel at even theoretical speeds, the journey between worlds should have taken centuries. Yet Gemini spoke of her own lifespan as singular, continuous. And those twin marks—they looked fresh, but not recent. They looked like they'd been earned through repetition.

The chronometer read fifteen minutes when Harry asked: ""How old are you, Gemini? In years?""

Gemini's bioluminescence flickered. A hesitation. ""I do not age as you age. I experience time differently. On each world, I lived for what seemed to me like decades. But—"" She paused. ""The transit between them was instantaneous, from my perspective. Folded. Compressed.""

""That's not possible.""

""No,"" Gemini agreed. ""It is not. And yet.""

Ten minutes left.

  


Sarah appeared in the doorway. ""Harry, I have to make the call now.""

""One more minute,"" Harry said. But he knew it was a lie. Sarah knew it too.

""I'm sorry,"" she said, pulling her headset. But before she could dial the administrator, alarms screamed to life across the colony. Sirens. The emergency tone that meant external threat. Red lights stuttered across the infirmary walls.

Sarah's headset crackled with chatter. Ship. Unidentified ship. In high orbit. Weapons systems active. Demands immediate custody of the alien. Fifteen minutes to compliance or bombardment begins.

Harry looked at Gemini. Gemini looked at Harry.

""They came,"" Gemini said quietly. ""I knew they would come. I sent a signal from the pod, before you found me. A location beacon. The frequency you heard—it was a call home.""

""Your people.""

""Not my people. My creators. My watchers. My..."" Gemini's voice fractured. ""My other selves.""

That's when Harry understood. Not a sudden revelation, but a cascade of comprehension as all the clues resolved into shape. The twin marks weren't natural variation—they were identification. The twin frequencies in the broadcast—two signals, one from the pod, one from... somewhere else. A satellite, maybe, hidden in high orbit for years. The phrase from The Little Prince—not a coincidence, but a trigger, a proof-of-concept that Gemini could be reached through human cultural artifacts. And the timeline that didn't add up.

""You're a probe,"" Harry said. ""Or a seed. You're not traveling between worlds—you're being sent. Multiple versions of yourself, spread across five worlds, gathering data. And now...""

""Now I have stopped,"" Gemini said. ""On each world, I was supposed to remain isolated. To collect information. To report back after a century. I did this, four times. I always returned when the signal came. But this time—"" Her eyes rotated toward Harry. ""This time I crashed deliberately. I did not answer the recall beacon. I came to Kepler-442b, your world, and I broke the pattern. I sent a dying signal, hoping you would find me, hoping you would believe me human enough to shelter. Hoping that your species, which I have always been closest to, would choose compassion over compliance.""

""What happens if they get you?""

""I will be recovered. My data will be analyzed. A new version of me will be created, refined, perfected. Sent to a new world. This cycle will continue until I have visited every star in my assigned radius. Or until my creators decide the experiment has failed.""

Harry checked his watch. ""How many minutes, do you think?""

""Eight,"" Sarah said from the doorway. She'd been listening to the chatter on her headset. ""Eight minutes before the bombardment threat becomes real.""

Harry made a choice. It was a simple choice, which is to say it was the most complicated thing he'd ever done. He stood up and walked to the infirmary's emergency systems console. He input a sequence of commands, his hands moving on muscle memory and instinct. The isolation field activated—an electromagnetic cage designed to protect against external contamination. It would also, he knew, block any outgoing signal. Any beacon. Any call home.

""What are you doing?"" Sarah asked.

""What she asked me to do,"" Harry said. ""I'm choosing shelter.""

Gemini's bioluminescence flared brilliant, almost painful to see. For a moment, Harry thought it was distress. Then he realized it was something else. Something like relief. Something like the light in the eyes of someone who had finally, after five lives across five worlds, found what they were looking for: not an answer, but a question worth asking. A species worth staying with.

""They will destroy the colony,"" Gemini said, not a question.

""Probably,"" Harry said. ""Unless Sarah plays this smart.""

Sarah was already moving. She'd understood the calculus instantly. She ran the chronometer on the evacuation protocols while simultaneously broadcasting a message on all diplomatic frequencies: the alien was contained, secure, and would be transferred to a neutral meeting point in the outer system within twenty-four hours. The military liaison aboard the orbital platform could stand down. The colony was cooperating.

It was a bluff. A beautiful, fragile bluff. And it worked.

The bombardment alarm fell silent. The orbital platform acknowledged. The standoff shifted from siege to negotiation.

In the infirmary, surrounded by failing equipment and failing hope, Harry sat beside Gemini and held her hand—her appendage, his mind corrected, though the gesture translated across species with surprising grace.

""You will come with me?"" Gemini asked.

""No,"" Harry said. ""I'll stay here. I'll tell them the truth—that you offered yourself peacefully, that you're willing to submit to study, that you're not a threat. I'll buy you time. Maybe enough time to figure out your next move.""

""And the colony?""

""Will survive. Because they'll choose to study what you are instead of destroy it. Because humans are good at that—at choosing curiosity over fear, at least sometimes."" Harry smiled. ""And because you're not the first impossible thing we've encountered. You're just the first one who had the good sense to ask for help.""

  


Gemini was transferred to the neutral platform in a medical pod, her isolation field intact, her beacon silent. Harry watched from the observation dome as the pod rose skyward, its trajectory carrying it toward the orbital platform, toward whatever future awaited her there.

Sarah stood beside him, coffee in hand. Real coffee this time, properly heated.

""They'll want to know why you did this,"" she said. ""The colony, the authorities, everyone.""

""I know.""

""You'll be relieved of duty. Possibly prosecuted for violating containment protocols.""

""I know that too.""

""Was it worth it?""

Harry thought about this. He thought about Gemini's fifth life, the one that would be different from all the rest because, for the first time, it would be her choice. He thought about the books she'd read in an abandoned colony, about a little prince asking the right questions. He thought about The Little Prince's singular insight: you become responsible for what you've tamed.

""Yeah,"" he said. ""I think it was.""

Above them, the orbital platform received the isolation pod. Harry imagined Gemini still in there, still holding the memory of his hand in hers, still carrying the weight and wonder of five lives lived in search of home.

Maybe that's what had always drawn her to humans, he thought. We understood that feeling. We understood the hunger for connection across the void. We understood that sometimes the right answer was the generous one, even when it cost everything.

The pod docked. Lights blinked acknowledgment.

Harry's long career as a surveyor was over. But maybe, he thought, a new one was just beginning—one where he'd have to navigate not the badlands of Kepler-442b, but the more treacherous terrain of human ethics, political fallout, and the question of what we owe to the lost and lonely, regardless of their origin.

Worth it, he confirmed silently. Absolutely worth it.",2,1760464058.0,OpenHFY,1,1.0,False

# What is the Florida–Georgia game and why Jacksonville?

The Florida–Georgia rivalry has been staged in Jacksonville since 1933 (with only rare exceptions). It’s one of college football’s signature neutral-site showdowns, drawing massive crowds and a weekend of tailgates that popularized the unofficial nickname “World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party.” (The schools and networks don’t use the nickname officially anymore, but you’ll still hear it.)

# Renovation note

Jacksonville hosts the game in 2025. Due to the $1.4B “Stadium of the Future” renovation, the matchup shifts to Atlanta (2026) and Tampa (2027), then returns to Jacksonville 2028–2031 under a renewed deal.

# Game-day timeline

*  8:00 AM – Stadium & fairgrounds parking opens. Arrive early; traffic stacks up and most lots are pre-sold.
*  10:00 AM – Fan Fare opens (family-friendly fun zone).
*  1:30 PM – Stadium gates open; new walk-through magnetometers & self-scan ticket kiosks speed entry. Keep your clear bag handy.
*  3:30 PM – Kickoff. (Florida sideline: west; Georgia: east.)

Pro tip: Aim to be parked \~5 hours before kickoff (by \~10:30 AM) to beat traffic and stroll into tailgates without rushing.

# RV City, tailgating & parking.

# RV City (Lot E)

*  A tradition steps from the stadium. Lot E across from EverBank Stadium. Expect a festive, all-week camp of Gators & Dawgs. Historically opens Tuesday of game week; 2025 private RV windows show Oct 29–Nov 2. Book early.[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gafljax.com/experience/?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1759637207175686&usg=AOvVaw2Pg3JqLXtR82wGcbVZjStH)

# Parking basics

*  Pre-purchase official stadium or fairgrounds parking where possible; lots open at 8 AM and can fill hours before kickoff.
*  Private operators near the Sports Complex (e.g., Tailgaters Parking) also offer car/RV spaces during game week.
*  Check your pass for lot opening times, tailgating rules, and egress routes to avoid gridlock. (Most lots require you to clear out within \~2 hours after the game.)

# Bag & entry

*  Follow the NFL clear-bag standard to breeze through security: clear tote ≤12""×6""×12"" or small clutch ≤4.5""×6.5"". Medically necessary items allowed after inspection.

# Tickets & seating

*  The official event page routes to Ticketmaster; use verified sources to avoid scams.
*  Home/visitor split matters if you’re sitting with your crowd: Florida (home) west side; Georgia east side in 2025.

# Things to do near EverBank Stadium (before/after)

Make a weekend of it! Jacksonville sprawls with neighborhoods worth exploring:

*  Downtown & Sports Complex: Riverwalk views, Friendship Fountain light shows on select nights, and walkable bars pre/postgame. (Check the city’s event calendars for pop-ups and riverfront happenings.)
*  Springfield: Historic homes, breweries, coffee shops; great for a relaxed brunch the morning after.
*  Riverside/Avondale: Oak-lined streets, Five Points eateries, local shops; perfect for late afternoon bites.
*  Jacksonville Beaches: If you’re staying through Sunday, head east for ocean time and seafood.

# Where to stay

*  Downtown puts you closest to stadium shuttles and riverfront festivities.
*  Springfield/Riverside offer charming historic stays a short rideshare away.
*  Beaches for a coastal vibe (plan \~25–35 mins, traffic permitting).

(Hotel availability spikes; book early, especially if you’re bringing an RV or a large group.)

I used to think strength meant being able to handle everything on my own.  
If I was struggling, I told myself to “man up.”  
If someone asked how I was doing, I’d say, *“I’m fine.”*

Only I wasn’t fine.

I was in the middle of a divorce, depressed, and trying to figure out who I was without the mask of being “the strong one.”  
One day at a coffee shop, I finally answered honestly when the barista asked how I was doing.

>“Honestly, I’m really struggling today, but thank you for asking.”

He paused, looked at me, and said he was sorry to hear that. He meant it.  
That small, awkward moment ended up changing my idea of what strength really means.

Since then, I’ve been thinking about how the **myth of self-sufficiency** isolates men.  
It tells us that we’re only strong if we never need help — but all it really does is keep us disconnected.

I've learned that vulnerability isn’t weakness — it’s rebellion.  
It’s how we rebuild real friendship and trust again.

An old-timer on the CB radio gave me three rules for dealing with the thing that runs alongside my truck at night.,"I drive a truck for a living. I’m not one of those guys with a tricked-out rig and a proud handle. I’m just a guy with a CDL and a mountain of debt, hauling cheap furniture from one soulless warehouse to another. My life is a series of lonely highways, greasy diner coffee, and the constant, hypnotic drone of a diesel engine. I’ve seen every corner of this country through the bug-spattered glass of my windshield. I thought I’d seen it all.

I was wrong.

This happened last night, on that notoriously desolate stretch of I-80 that cuts through the salt flats of the state. It’s a place that feels like the surface of the moon. Flat, white, and empty for a hundred miles in every direction. It’s 3 AM. The road is a straight, black ribbon unwinding into a void, the only light coming from my own high beams and a brilliant, star-dusted sky. I’d been driving for ten hours straight, pushing to make a deadline in Salt Lake City. My eyes were burning, my brain was a fuzzy, caffeine-addled mess.

That’s when I saw the flicker of movement.

It was in the scrub desert to my right, at the very edge of my headlight’s reach. My first thought was a coyote, or maybe a deer that had wandered too far from anything green. I kept my eyes on the road, but I was aware of it now.

Then I saw it again. It was a tall, loping shape, moving with a terrifying, unnatural grace. It was keeping pace with my rig.

I was doing a steady 65 miles per hour.

My blood ran cold. I took my foot off the accelerator, the truck slowing to 60. The shape in the darkness slowed with me, its long, spindly legs pumping with an effortless, fluid motion. My heart started to hammer against my ribs. I pushed the accelerator down, the engine groaning as the truck climbed back to 70. It sped up, too, staying perfectly parallel to my cab, a silent, dark greyhound in the night.

I couldn’t make out any details. Just its silhouette. It was vaguely humanoid, but too tall, too thin. Its arms were too long, its stride impossibly wide. It ran with a smooth, gliding motion, its feet seeming to barely touch the ground.

This went on for five miles. An eternity. Just the roar of my engine and the silent, impossible runner in the dark. My logical mind was scrambling for an explanation. An optical illusion? A strange reflection in my side window? But it was too consistent, too real.

My hand, slick with a cold sweat, reached for the CB radio. It was an old habit, a holdover from a time before cell phones. Most of the time, the channels were just a hissing, static-filled void. But out here, in the dead of night, sometimes you could find another lonely soul to talk to.

I keyed the mic, my voice a shaky, hoarse whisper. “Uh… breaker one-nine… anyone got a copy out on I-80, eastbound, about a hundred miles west of the lake?”

The static hissed back at me. I was about to give up when a voice crackled through the speaker. It was an old, weary voice, gravelly from a lifetime of cigarettes and truck stop coffee.

“You got a copy, driver. What’s your twenty?”

“I… I don’t know,” I stammered. “I think I’m seeing something out here. Something… running. Alongside me.”

There was a long, heavy pause on the other end of the line. The static hissed and popped. When the old-timer’s voice came back, all the weariness was gone, replaced by a cold, sharp urgency.

“Son, you listen to me,” he said, his voice low and serious. “You listen to me and you do exactly what I say. You see a tall, fast runner out there in the dark?”

“Yeah,” I whispered.

“Okay. You’ve got a Pacer. We call ‘em Pacers. Now, you’re gonna follow a few simple rules. You got that? Simple, but you don’t break ‘em. Not for anything.”

“What… what are the rules?”

“Rule number one,” the voice crackled. “You do not take your eyes off the road to stare at it. You see it in your peripheral vision, you keep it there. You do not give it your full attention. You understand? ”

“Okay,” I said, my eyes glued to the white lines on the asphalt in front of me, even as my brain was screaming at me to look to my right.

“Rule number two. You do not acknowledge it in any way. You don’t flash your lights, you don’t honk your horn, you don’t talk to it. As far as you’re concerned, it’s not there. It’s just a shadow, a trick of the light. You give it nothing.”

“Got it,” I breathed.

“And rule number three,” the old-timer said, his voice dropping even lower, “and this is the most important one. Whatever you do, son, you do not stop your vehicle. Not for anything. Not for a flat tire, not for a flashing light, not if the damn engine catches on fire. You keep that truck rolling until the sun comes up. You hear me?”

“But what is it?” I pleaded. “What does it want?”

There was another long, heavy sigh from the other side of the radio. “kid. It’s an escort. The problem is, you don’t want to go where it’s taking you. You just keep driving. You keep your eyes on the road, and you drive east. Pray you got enough fuel to make it to dawn.”

The radio went silent. He was gone. And I was alone again, with the silent runner and his three, terrible rules.

I tried to focus. Eyes on the road. Don’t acknowledge it. Don’t stop. It sounded simple enough. But the presence of it, a constant, loping shadow in the corner of my vision, was a screaming distraction.

I glanced down at my GPS, hoping the familiar, comforting sight of the digital map would ground me. But the screen was wrong. The little icon that represented my truck was no longer on the clean, straight line of I-80. It was on a thin, grey road that wasn’t on the map, a road that was veering off into a vast, blank, unlabeled spot on the screen. The GPS was still tracking my speed, my heading… but it was showing me on a road that didn’t exist.

My heart seized. I looked up. And up ahead, in the distance, I saw them. Faint, flickering lights. The lights of a town.

It was impossible. I knew this stretch of road like the back of my hand. There was nothing out here. No towns, no truck stops, no civilization for at least another fifty miles. But the lights were there, a warm, inviting glow in the oppressive darkness.

And the Pacer, still running alongside my truck, subtly, gracefully, lifted one of its long, thin arms, and then just… gestured. A slow, deliberate point towards an off-ramp that was now materializing out of the darkness ahead. An off-ramp that I knew, with an absolute certainty, was not supposed to be there. The off-ramp led directly towards the ghost town.

It was a silent, undeniable command. A polite, but firm, invitation to a place I did not want to go.

Rule number three. Do not stop. But what about turning? The old-timer hadn’t said anything about turning.

My hands were slick on the steering wheel. The pull to turn, to follow the lights, to follow the Pacer’s silent instruction, was a physical thing. A magnetic urge. But the old man’s terrified voice was a louder sound in my head. You don’t want to go where it’s taking you.

I kept the wheel straight. I kept my eyes on the road ahead, on the true, real, lonely ribbon of I-80. I ignored the phantom off-ramp. I ignored the silent, pointing arm in my periphery.

The moment I passed the off-ramp, the atmosphere in the cab changed. The air grew cold, heavy. And the Pacer… it was no longer loping gracefully. The smooth, fluid motion was gone, replaced by a jerky, angry, frantic pumping of its limbs. It was still keeping pace, but it was a movement of rage, of frustrated energy.

I had disobeyed.

Up ahead, I saw flashing lights. My first thought was a police car, a state trooper. A wave of relief washed over me. But as I got closer, I saw it was just a car, pulled over on the shoulder, its hazard lights blinking in a steady, lonely rhythm. The driver’s side door was wide open.

And standing perfectly still beside the car, silhouetted in the flashing orange light, was another Pacer.

It wasn't moving. It was just standing there, as still as a statue, its head turned towards my approaching truck. It was waiting. Its partner had failed to guide me off the road. So now, it had a roadblock.

Rule number one. Don’t stare at it. Rule number three. Do not stop.

My foot trembled on the accelerator. Every instinct in my body was screaming at me to slow down, to swerve. But I could hear the old man’s voice. I kept the wheel straight. I focused on the space between the stopped car and the white line, a gap that was barely wide enough for my rig to fit through.

As I drew level with the car, I couldn’t help but glance. For a split second, my eyes met the Pacer’s.

It had no face. Just a smooth, grey, featureless expanse of skin where its eyes and mouth should have been. And as my high beams washed over it, that blank face turned, its head tracking my cab as I passed, a silent, damning accusation.

I shot past the stopped car, my truck’s side mirror missing its open door by inches. In my rearview mirror, I saw the Pacer, still standing there, a silent, faceless sentinel in the flashing lights. And then, it started to move, loping after me, joining its partner in the angry, frantic chase.

There were two of them now.

The next few hours were the purest, most distilled form of terror I have ever known. Two loping, silent shapes in the darkness, one on either side of my truck. The road in front of me seemed to warp and twist, the white lines writhing like snakes. The ghost town lights appeared and disappeared on the horizon, a siren’s call I had to constantly, actively resist. My GPS was useless, the screen a chaotic mess of non-existent roads and impossible topography.

I was alone, in the dark, in a place that was no longer following the rules of the world I knew. My only compass was the memory of the old trucker’s voice. My only hope was the faint, grey promise of dawn on the eastern horizon.

I drove. I kept my eyes on the road. I didn’t acknowledge them. I didn’t stop.

And as the first, tentative rays of sunlight finally, blessedly, began to pierce the darkness, they were gone.

They didn’t run off. They didn’t fade away. They were just… not there anymore. The world outside my windshield was once again the familiar, empty, beautiful Utah desert. My GPS chimed, and the screen returned to normal, showing my little truck icon sitting perfectly on the solid, reassuring line of I-80.

I drove until I reached town, the real one. I delivered my load. I quit my job. I’m in a cheap motel room now, a thousand miles from that stretch of road. But I know I’m not safe. Because last night, I broke rule number one. I stared. I let it see me see it.

And I have the terrible, unshakable feeling that the next time I’m on a lonely road late at night, a Pacer will be there again until it makes me follow it.",1,1760463833.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Curious if anyone here has worked with or tasted the *Sweetbird* line of syrups or sauces? I’ve been in the coffee world for a while and recently started seeing them pop up more here in Texas — mostly in cafés. I tried a few and honestly, I was surprised — they taste clean, not artificial or sugary. The brand feels kind of fresh and a bit more European in style, if that makes sense.

Just wondering what other baristas or café owners think — anyone using them regularly behind the bar? Any standout flavors or feedback from customers? ",1,1760463825.0,barista,5,1.0,False

An old-timer on the CB radio gave me three rules for dealing with the thing that runs alongside my truck at night.,"I drive a truck for a living. I’m not one of those guys with a tricked-out rig and a proud handle. I’m just a guy with a CDL and a mountain of debt, hauling cheap furniture from one soulless warehouse to another. My life is a series of lonely highways, greasy diner coffee, and the constant, hypnotic drone of a diesel engine. I’ve seen every corner of this country through the bug-spattered glass of my windshield. I thought I’d seen it all.

I was wrong.

This happened last night, on that notoriously desolate stretch of I-80 that cuts through the salt flats of the state. It’s a place that feels like the surface of the moon. Flat, white, and empty for a hundred miles in every direction. It’s 3 AM. The road is a straight, black ribbon unwinding into a void, the only light coming from my own high beams and a brilliant, star-dusted sky. I’d been driving for ten hours straight, pushing to make a deadline in Salt Lake City. My eyes were burning, my brain was a fuzzy, caffeine-addled mess.

That’s when I saw the flicker of movement.

It was in the scrub desert to my right, at the very edge of my headlight’s reach. My first thought was a coyote, or maybe a deer that had wandered too far from anything green. I kept my eyes on the road, but I was aware of it now.

Then I saw it again. It was a tall, loping shape, moving with a terrifying, unnatural grace. It was keeping pace with my rig.

I was doing a steady 65 miles per hour.

My blood ran cold. I took my foot off the accelerator, the truck slowing to 60. The shape in the darkness slowed with me, its long, spindly legs pumping with an effortless, fluid motion. My heart started to hammer against my ribs. I pushed the accelerator down, the engine groaning as the truck climbed back to 70. It sped up, too, staying perfectly parallel to my cab, a silent, dark greyhound in the night.

I couldn’t make out any details. Just its silhouette. It was vaguely humanoid, but too tall, too thin. Its arms were too long, its stride impossibly wide. It ran with a smooth, gliding motion, its feet seeming to barely touch the ground.

This went on for five miles. An eternity. Just the roar of my engine and the silent, impossible runner in the dark. My logical mind was scrambling for an explanation. An optical illusion? A strange reflection in my side window? But it was too consistent, too real.

My hand, slick with a cold sweat, reached for the CB radio. It was an old habit, a holdover from a time before cell phones. Most of the time, the channels were just a hissing, static-filled void. But out here, in the dead of night, sometimes you could find another lonely soul to talk to.

I keyed the mic, my voice a shaky, hoarse whisper. “Uh… breaker one-nine… anyone got a copy out on I-80, eastbound, about a hundred miles west of the lake?”

The static hissed back at me. I was about to give up when a voice crackled through the speaker. It was an old, weary voice, gravelly from a lifetime of cigarettes and truck stop coffee.

“You got a copy, driver. What’s your twenty?”

“I… I don’t know,” I stammered. “I think I’m seeing something out here. Something… running. Alongside me.”

There was a long, heavy pause on the other end of the line. The static hissed and popped. When the old-timer’s voice came back, all the weariness was gone, replaced by a cold, sharp urgency.

“Son, you listen to me,” he said, his voice low and serious. “You listen to me and you do exactly what I say. You see a tall, fast runner out there in the dark?”

“Yeah,” I whispered.

“Okay. You’ve got a Pacer. We call ‘em Pacers. Now, you’re gonna follow a few simple rules. You got that? Simple, but you don’t break ‘em. Not for anything.”

“What… what are the rules?”

“Rule number one,” the voice crackled. “You do not take your eyes off the road to stare at it. You see it in your peripheral vision, you keep it there. You do not give it your full attention. You understand? ”

“Okay,” I said, my eyes glued to the white lines on the asphalt in front of me, even as my brain was screaming at me to look to my right.

“Rule number two. You do not acknowledge it in any way. You don’t flash your lights, you don’t honk your horn, you don’t talk to it. As far as you’re concerned, it’s not there. It’s just a shadow, a trick of the light. You give it nothing.”

“Got it,” I breathed.

“And rule number three,” the old-timer said, his voice dropping even lower, “and this is the most important one. Whatever you do, son, you do not stop your vehicle. Not for anything. Not for a flat tire, not for a flashing light, not if the damn engine catches on fire. You keep that truck rolling until the sun comes up. You hear me?”

“But what is it?” I pleaded. “What does it want?”

There was another long, heavy sigh from the other side of the radio. “kid. It’s an escort. The problem is, you don’t want to go where it’s taking you. You just keep driving. You keep your eyes on the road, and you drive east. Pray you got enough fuel to make it to dawn.”

The radio went silent. He was gone. And I was alone again, with the silent runner and his three, terrible rules.

1o6mb5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_sarapoet85/comments/1o6mb5t/oc_love_is_possible/,[OC] love is possible,"When I speak of her,
the air softens 
like even the wind remembers her name.

She wasn’t loud.
Didn’t need to be.
Her strength was quiet 
a kind that stitched broken things back together
without anyone noticing the thread.

She taught me that love
wasn’t something you said,
it was something you showed 
in the way you stay,
even when the world forgets to.

I still feel her in small things 
the hum of morning coffee,
the rhythm of a rocking chair,
the way sunlight lands on an old photograph
as if she’s trying to smile through it.

Grief doesn’t end;
it just learns how to breathe beside you.
Some days, I swear I hear her voice
in the hush between heartbeats,
telling me to keep going 
to rise like she did,
with grace that doesn’t announce itself,
with faith that doesn’t need proof.

Five years,
and I still catch myself
wanting to tell her things.
The good. The bad.
The little moments she would’ve made beautiful
just by listening.

But I know now 
she’s not gone.
She’s the stillness before I speak.
The reason I choose kindness,
even when it hurts.
The whisper that reminds me:
love never dies,
it just changes form.

So this 
this is for her.
For every quiet hero
who teaches the world what love really means.
For every hand that held us steady
when we thought we’d fall apart.

This is more than a poem.
It’s a pulse 
a promise 
a thank you.

Because she gave me more
than words ever could.

I’ve just decided to buy a bus and the hardest thing about deciding was seeing all of the $50k+ builds from very well off families not even living out of their buses. Amazing for them but I’m a broke ass 24yo buying a bus so I have security (and don’t have to give up my lifestyle of travel). I don’t care to see the sky light in the giant shower with rain head, as beautiful and cool as that is. I need to see the duct tape fixes and crazy creations! All of this to say, I’m so appreciative to find this group. After hours of searching youtube to no avail, I finally decided to hop on reddit and found this group within 5 minutes. 

Sorry for a paragraph of sucking up, but I almost didn’t say yes to the bus so i’m very thankful!

Let’s get into it, I want a fridge (or something) but I don’t want to spend so much on propane every month and a solar panel situation with electricity running through the bus is FAR in the future for me. There are so many forgotten ways to store food, I’d build a root cellar in my bus if I could, I’m curious if anyone here has their own creative way to keep food cool. I’ll probably get a small ass freezer box for ice cream but for coffee creamer, milk, other things that require more space, I’m on the hunt. 

I’m open to any and all advice and feedback on this and if you have any other “duct tape” fixes for anything in your van/bus worth sharing, I’d love to see it.

🧬 supermonkeygodkingemperor's Master Alzheimer's Reversal Protocol 4.0

*(Building on Neuro-Resilience Stack 3.0: Shifting from prevention to active reversal via enhanced neurogenesis, amyloid/tau clearance, synaptic repair, and macro-psilocybin integration. Evidence-based on emerging neuroscience, including BDNF amplification, glial modulation, and psychedelic-induced plasticity. Note: This is conceptual and for educational purposes only—consult a physician for any implementation, especially with controlled substances like psilocybin, which may require clinical supervision where legal for therapeutic use.)*

This protocol refines the foundational stack by:
- **Amplifying reversal mechanisms**: Incorporating higher-intensity interventions targeting amyloid-beta clearance, tau hyperphosphorylation reversal, and hippocampal volume restoration.
- **Integrating macro-psilocybin**: Replacing microdoses with structured macro sessions (1–3g dried equivalent, ~10–25mg psilocybin) for profound 5-HT2A-driven rewiring, based on trials showing psychedelic-induced neuroplasticity surges (e.g., 300–500% BDNF spikes lasting days).
- **Fixes/Improvements**:
  - **Added clearance agents**: Lithium orotate (low-dose) for autophagy/tau clearance; spermidine for autophagic flux.
  - **Gut-brain upgrades**: Specific strains (e.g., Akkermansia) for butyrate production linked to amyloid reduction.
  - **Mitochondrial boost**: Added NAD+ precursors (NMN/NR) for sirtuin synergy and energy restoration in degenerating neurons.
  - **Cycling adjustments**: Shorter cycles to prevent adaptation in reversal scenarios; monitoring for oxidative stress.
  - **Lifestyle intensification**: Added sauna/heat therapy for heat-shock proteins aiding protein misfolding correction.
  - **Safety buffers**: Emphasized biomarkers (e.g., blood tests for inflammation markers like hs-CRP, homocysteine) and gradual titration.
  - **Evidence integration**: Drew from recent studies (e.g., psilocybin's role in default mode network reset for cognitive flexibility; sulforaphane's phase II trial data on mild AD).

# Phase 1 — Foundation: Membrane Repair & Energy Restoration (Morning)

|Compound|Typical Range|Primary Reversal Function|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Uridine Monophosphate (UMP)**|400–600 mg|Accelerates phosphatidylcholine for damaged membrane rebuilding; supports RNA repair in stressed neurons.|
|**Citicoline (CDP-Choline)**|300–600 mg|Direct choline donor; enhances acetylcholine in cholinergic deficits common in AD.|
|**DHA + EPA (Omega-3s)**|1500–3000 mg|Reduces neuroinflammation; promotes amyloid clearance via lipid rafts.|
|**Magnesium L-Threonate**|1500–2500 mg|Boosts synaptic pruning of dysfunctional connections; BBB-penetrant for hippocampal targeting.|
|**CoQ10 (Ubiquinol)**|200–300 mg|Restores mitochondrial ATP in energy-depleted AD brains.|
|**PQQ**|20–40 mg|Triggers mitophagy to clear damaged mitochondria; synergizes with NAD+ boosters.|
|**NMN or NR (NAD+ precursor)**|500–1000 mg|Elevates NAD+ for sirtuin-mediated DNA repair and tau deacetylation.|

**Enhancer Fix**: Pair with 1–2 tsp MCT oil + black coffee (caffeine optional, 100–200mg) for 4–6× fat-soluble uptake and mild AMPK activation.

# Phase 2 — Clearance & Anti-Inflammatory Drive (Midday)

|Compound|Range|Reversal Function|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Lion’s Mane (dual extract)**|1500–3000 mg|NGF/BDNF for regenerating lost neurons; evidence in AD models for amyloid reduction.|
|**Reishi**|1000–1500 mg|Modulates microglia to clear plaques; anti-oxidant for tau tangle prevention.|
|**Cordyceps**|750 mg (daily now)|Enhances oxygen utilization in hypoxic AD brain regions.|
|**Curcumin + BioPerine**|1000–1500 mg|Inhibits amyloid aggregation; crosses BBB to reduce tau phosphorylation.|
|**Sulforaphane (broccoli sprout extract)**|40–60 mg (≈ 200 µmol)|Nrf2-driven detoxification; human trials show cognitive improvements in mild AD via glutathione boost.|
|**Resveratrol or Pterostilbene**|500–750 mg|SIRT1 activation for autophagy; aids in reversing mitochondrial fragmentation.|
|**Lithium Orotate**|5–10 mg|Promotes autophagy; low-dose evidence for tau clearance and mood stabilization in AD.|

**Synergy Improvement**: Add green tea extract (EGCG, 200–400mg) here for complementary amyloid disaggregation—creates a ""clearance triad"" with curcumin/sulforaphane.

# Phase 3 — Neuroplasticity & Consolidation (Evening)

|Compound|Range|Reversal Function|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**CBD (full-spectrum)**|20–50 mg|Protects new neurons from amyloid toxicity; modulates ECS for glial calming.|
|**THC (optional, low-dose)**|2–5 mg (1:1 CBD ratio)|Synergistic with CBD for sleep architecture repair; potential for hippocampal volume increase—legal/medical supervision required.|
|**Phosphatidylserine**|200–400 mg|Cortisol dampening; supports membrane asymmetry lost in AD.|
|**Vitamin D3 (+ K2)**|4000–8000 IU (+ 200 µg K2)|Reduces neuroinflammation; correlates with slower AD progression in cohorts.|
|**B-Complex (activated forms: P5P B6, Methylfolate B9, Methylcobalamin B12)**|1.5–2× label dose|Lowers homocysteine (AD risk factor); aids methylation for gene expression repair.|
|**Spermidine**|5–10 mg (from wheat germ extract)|Induces autophagy; animal studies show reversal of memory deficits via synaptic cleanup.|

**Bioavailability Fix**: Take with fermented yogurt or kefir for gut synergy and better absorption.

# Phase 4 — Macro-Psilocybin Reversal Pulses (Bi-weekly to Monthly)

|Compound|Range|Purpose in Reversal|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Psilocybin macro dose** *(dried mushrooms, where legal/therapeutic)*|1–3 g (10–25mg psilocybin)|Full 5-HT2A agonism for massive BDNF/NGF release; resets dysfunctional networks, promotes dendritic regrowth, and may facilitate amyloid clearance via enhanced glial activity. Sessions in clinical settings show lasting cognitive gains in neurodegenerative models.|
|**Lion’s Mane (boost)** + **Niacin (B3)**|2000 mg + 100–200 mg|Amplifies Stamets-inspired synergy; niacin flush enhances peripheral delivery.|

**Protocol Improvement**: Conduct in guided sessions (therapist/integration coach). Pre-load 48h with omega-3s + antioxidants to mitigate oxidative stress. Post-session (1–3 days): Focus on rest, hydration, and journaling to consolidate plasticity. Frequency: Start bi-weekly for aggressive reversal, taper to monthly as cognition stabilizes. Monitor with cognitive assessments (e.g., MoCA scores).

**Evidence Note**: Emerging trials (e.g., Johns Hopkins/Imperial College) indicate macro-psilocybin induces neuroplastic windows lasting weeks, potentially reversing synaptic loss in AD-like conditions. Combine with VR/therapy for targeted memory reactivation.

# Phase 5 — Gut-Brain Axis Overhaul (Daily)

|Compound|Form|Reversal Function|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Prebiotic Fiber (Inulin, FOS, Resistant Starch + Beta-Glucan)**|10–15 g|Boosts SCFA (butyrate) for BBB integrity and amyloid reduction via vagus nerve signaling.|
|**Probiotic Blend (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, Akkermansia muciniphila)**|20–50 B CFU|Targets dysbiosis in AD; Akkermansia linked to tau pathology reversal in mice.|
|**Fermented Foods + Butyric Acid Supplement**|Sauerkraut, miso + 500–1000mg butyrate|Direct gut metabolite support for neurotrophins.|

**Fix**: Rotate strains monthly to maintain diversity; test microbiome (e.g., via stool kits) for personalization.

# Lifestyle Integration (Intensified for Reversal)

* **Diet**: Strict MIND + ketogenic elements (e.g., 50–100g carbs/day) to shift metabolism toward ketone bodies, which bypass glucose deficits in AD brains.
* **Exercise**: 200 min/week HIIT/aerobic + resistance; add yoga for vagal tone and BDNF.
* **Sleep**: 7–9h with chronotherapy (e.g., blue-light blockers); track REM for consolidation.
* **Cognitive Training**: App-based (e.g., Lumosity) + novel learning; pair with post-psilocybin sessions for amplified effects.
* **Stress/Social**: Mindfulness meditation + group therapy; address isolation as it exacerbates progression.
* **New Addition: Heat Therapy**: Sauna/cold plunges 3×/week for HSP70 induction, aiding protein refolding in tau/amyloid.

# ⚗️ Optimization & Cycling (Reversal-Adjusted)

|Category|Recommended Cycle|Purpose/Fix|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Mushrooms (Lion’s Mane/Reishi/Cordyceps)**|4 days on / 3 off|Higher intensity; prevents buildup in reversal phase.|
|**Cannabinoids**|2 weeks on / 1 off|Enhanced sensitivity for chronic use in AD.|
|**Psilocybin Macro**|Bi-weekly initial, then monthly|Allows integration; monitor for serotonin syndrome risk (rare).|
|**Base Nutrients (UMP, DHA, B-Vits)**|Continuous with 1 rest day/week|Add blood monitoring for deficiencies.|
|**Clearance Agents (Lithium, Spermidine)**|3 weeks on / 1 off|Prevent electrolyte imbalance.|

**Safety Improvement**: Baseline labs (CBC, liver/kidney function, inflammatory markers) before starting; titrate slowly (start at 50% doses). Avoid if contraindications (e.g., bipolar for lithium).

# 🧮 Reversal Model (Updated Conceptual)

Baseline AD neurogenesis: ~200–300 surviving neurons/day (reduced vs. healthy).  
Stack multiplier (3–4× via Lion’s Mane/psilocybin): ~800–1,200/day.  
Macro-psilocybin pulse: Transient 5–10× spike (~2,000–3,000/day for 48h).  
Target: Restore to 1.5–2× healthy baseline sustainably; track via MRI/PET if possible.

# 🧠 Final Fixes / Additions

✅ **Macro-Psilocybin**: Fully integrated as core reversal catalyst.  
✅ **NAD+ Boosters**: For mitochondrial reversal.  
✅ **Autophagy Enhancers**: Lithium/spermidine for plaque/tangle cleanup.  
✅ **Gut Specificity**: Akkermansia + butyrate for AD-linked dysbiosis.  
✅ **Heat Therapy**: HSP for proteinopathy.  
⚠️ **Experimental Edges**: Avoid unproven like stem cells; stick to accessible compounds.  
⚠️ **Rapamycin/Metformin**: Still doctor-supervised; potential for mTOR inhibition in reversal but risk of side effects.

# 🧭 TL;DR “Reversal Stack” Structure

**Morning:** UMP + Citicoline + DHA + Mag L-Threonate + CoQ10 + PQQ + NMN  
**Midday:** Lion’s Mane + Curcumin + Sulforaphane + Resveratrol + Reishi/Cordyceps + Lithium + EGCG  
**Evening:** CBD (+ optional THC) + Phosphatidylserine + Vit D3 + B-Complex + Spermidine  
**Bi-weekly/Monthly:** Macro-psilocybin session (+ Lion’s Mane + Niacin)  
**Daily Gut:** Upgraded pre-/probiotics + ferments + butyrate  
**Lifestyle:** MIND-keto diet + intensified exercise/sleep + cognitive training + heat therapy + social support

1o6m7gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1o6m7gs/oc_love_is_possible/,[OC] love is possible,"When I speak of her,
the air softens 
like even the wind remembers her name.

She wasn’t loud.
Didn’t need to be.
Her strength was quiet 
a kind that stitched broken things back together
without anyone noticing the thread.

She taught me that love
wasn’t something you said,
it was something you showed 
in the way you stay,
even when the world forgets to.

I still feel her in small things 
the hum of morning coffee,
the rhythm of a rocking chair,
the way sunlight lands on an old photograph
as if she’s trying to smile through it.

Grief doesn’t end;
it just learns how to breathe beside you.
Some days, I swear I hear her voice
in the hush between heartbeats,
telling me to keep going 
to rise like she did,
with grace that doesn’t announce itself,
with faith that doesn’t need proof.

Five years,
and I still catch myself
wanting to tell her things.
The good. The bad.
The little moments she would’ve made beautiful
just by listening.

But I know now 
she’s not gone.
She’s the stillness before I speak.
The reason I choose kindness,
even when it hurts.
The whisper that reminds me:
love never dies,
it just changes form.

So this 
this is for her.
For every quiet hero
who teaches the world what love really means.
For every hand that held us steady
when we thought we’d fall apart.

This is more than a poem.
It’s a pulse 
a promise 
a thank you.

Because she gave me more
than words ever could.

[Emotional Story | Self Growth | Life Lessons]","I never thought I’d be the kind of person writing something like this. But here I am — at 2 AM, staring at my ceiling, replaying everything I’ve lost.

Last year, I hit what felt like rock bottom.
My relationship ended. My best friend stopped talking to me. I lost my job in the same week I lost my home. Everything I built for years just… collapsed.

For months, I kept asking myself — “Why me?”
Why does life break the ones who try the hardest to stay strong?

But over time, something changed.
I started walking alone every evening. I began journaling again. I reconnected with my family. I even smiled at strangers — something I hadn’t done in years.

Slowly, I realized that losing everything forced me to see what truly mattered. It wasn’t the job title, the relationship, or the status. It was the peace that comes when you finally stop pretending you’re okay just to make others comfortable.

Today, I’m not “fully healed.” I still have bad days. But I’m learning to find beauty in small things — a good cup of coffee, a quiet morning, a text from an old friend.

|:-|:-|:-|
|**Mushrooms (Lion’s Mane/Reishi/Cordyceps)**|4 days on / 3 off|Higher intensity; prevents buildup in reversal phase.|
|**Cannabinoids**|2 weeks on / 1 off|Enhanced sensitivity for chronic use in AD.|
|**Psilocybin Macro**|Bi-weekly initial, then monthly|Allows integration; monitor for serotonin syndrome risk (rare).|
|**Base Nutrients (UMP, DHA, B-Vits)**|Continuous with 1 rest day/week|Add blood monitoring for deficiencies.|
|**Clearance Agents (Lithium, Spermidine)**|3 weeks on / 1 off|Prevent electrolyte imbalance.|

**Safety Improvement**: Baseline labs (CBC, liver/kidney function, inflammatory markers) before starting; titrate slowly (start at 50% doses). Avoid if contraindications (e.g., bipolar for lithium).

# 🧮 Reversal Model (Updated Conceptual)

Baseline AD neurogenesis: ~200–300 surviving neurons/day (reduced vs. healthy).  
Stack multiplier (3–4× via Lion’s Mane/psilocybin): ~800–1,200/day.  
Macro-psilocybin pulse: Transient 5–10× spike (~2,000–3,000/day for 48h).  
Target: Restore to 1.5–2× healthy baseline sustainably; track via MRI/PET if possible.

# 🧠 Final Fixes / Additions

✅ **Macro-Psilocybin**: Fully integrated as core reversal catalyst.  
✅ **NAD+ Boosters**: For mitochondrial reversal.  
✅ **Autophagy Enhancers**: Lithium/spermidine for plaque/tangle cleanup.  
✅ **Gut Specificity**: Akkermansia + butyrate for AD-linked dysbiosis.  
✅ **Heat Therapy**: HSP for proteinopathy.  
⚠️ **Experimental Edges**: Avoid unproven like stem cells; stick to accessible compounds.  
⚠️ **Rapamycin/Metformin**: Still doctor-supervised; potential for mTOR inhibition in reversal but risk of side effects.

# 🧭 TL;DR “Reversal Stack” Structure

**Morning:** UMP + Citicoline + DHA + Mag L-Threonate + CoQ10 + PQQ + NMN  
**Midday:** Lion’s Mane + Curcumin + Sulforaphane + Resveratrol + Reishi/Cordyceps + Lithium + EGCG  
**Evening:** CBD (+ optional THC) + Phosphatidylserine + Vit D3 + B-Complex + Spermidine  
**Bi-weekly/Monthly:** Macro-psilocybin session (+ Lion’s Mane + Niacin)  
**Daily Gut:** Upgraded pre-/probiotics + ferments + butyrate  
**Lifestyle:** MIND-keto diet + intensified exercise/sleep + cognitive training + heat therapy + social support",1,1760463430.0,u_SuperGodMonkeyKing,0,1.0,False

1o6m1lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermiculture/comments/1o6m1lt/general_nondisruptive_indicators_of_bin_health_or/,"General non-disruptive indicators of bin health (or rather, do no escapes = happy worms?)","So I'm about 4 months into my first worm bin and the novelty has worn off such that I'm no longer checking on my wormies twice a day. I've even started a second identical bin, and I've only ever seen one worm even try ""exploring"" up the sides of the bin, not even an escape. Which I thought was weird because I've got a lot of condensation on the bin as I run with an enclosed lid (with little air holes).



I'm still interested in checking the health of the bin, but sometimes I don't want to spend the time doing anything heavy handed (so no digging through the bin, or squeezing the bedding to test moisture). I'm sure the worms will appreciate it too.

  
The thing I want to ask everyone is: **are there any observational indicators of how well a bin is doing that we can do just by opening the lid or removing the top covering? Or is this just a case of no escapes = happy worms?** If you had 10 seconds to observe the bin to check for health, what would you be looking for?

I was thinking about all the ways worms can get unhappy and I could think of the following.

1. Too wet
2. Too dry
3. Too hot
4. Too cold
5. Not enough food
6. Insufficient oxygen (inadequate ventilation or barriers formed by materials matting)
7. Compaction
8. Harsh chemical environment (pH, and toxins)

  
In my mind, no escape attempts would indicate 1,2,3,5,6, and 8 were satisfied. I would imagined being too cold would be impossible to observe without some kind of digging to find worm balling, but is not a concern where I live. 

For compaction, would this be indicated my an anaerobic smell? Or is localised compaction a non-issue in worm bins? 

Some quick indicators that I've been using were:

* **No escapes,** obviously
* **Condensation on the lid and the walls**. - Some condensation is okay, but if the lid has enough moisture such that it starts to form a stream when I hold it vertically, it's time to dry it out a little.
* **The layer of ""dry bedding"" on the surface** or layer of cardboard should be slightly damp to the touch. Bone dry = too dry? (I use a ? because it's never happened to me).
* **Any off smells.** Rotting food, ammonia etc. Anything that doesnt smell like wet cardboard, fresh coffee grounds or mushrooms.
* **Touch test of temperature** on the outside of the bin for any localised warm areas? (again, never happened to me).
* **Presence/quantity of animals** such as mites and fungus gnats.

  
Also are there things we can do to check the difference between worms that are surviving vs thriving? I'm still a newbie so any feedback is welcome.

Every project talks about “community” like it’s a marketing feature.
Newsflash: we ARE the community.

The Squeal Squad isn’t some DAO or brand — it’s a rebellion with a sense of humour.
We don’t chase coins, we chase culture.
We’re here to build worlds that can’t be deleted, stories that can’t be owned by suits, and laughs that actually mean something.

If you’re tired of:

	•	Games with NFTs but no fun,
	•	And influencers pretending to be prophets…

Then grab your controller, your coffee, or your chaos — you’re home.

We’re not promising the moon. We’re promising noise.
Because in a world full of quiet compliance, squealing is a superpower.

I also offered to work the remaining 30 minutes at the end of the day so my colleague could leave at 3:00 instead of 3:30, and I’d stay until 4:00. I thought that was generous.

 I walked the flooded grass until my legs ached and came back with nothing. No frogs, no lizards, no turtles, not even a minnow. The water hides everything and I am too slow, too untrained, too weak. Hunger gnaws, but I will not waste what little strength I have left.

So I boiled a cup of water, tore open one of the last packets of coffee, and dropped in a handful of raw grain. The grass kernels stay hard between my teeth. It is not food, not really. But it warms me. So I sip and pretend it is a meal. Pretend it will keep me alive.

But this will not do. I need another way. I keep seeing ripples at the edge of the reeds, flashes of scales darting from shadow to shadow. Fish are here in great abundance. I know it. Frogs too. Maybe even crayfish or crabs clinging to the mud banks. Small things, but more than enough of them if I can catch them.

I will weave a basket trap from reeds, set it in the shallows with bait and check it each morning. I can build a fence of sticks and rocks across the current of streams and funnel whatever swims into a narrow mouth where I wait with my spear. A net would be better, but I have no cord fine enough to knot. Not yet.

Nan always said, “Keep your hands busy, boy. The land will show you what it has.” 

The land is showing me a smorgasbord of fish, shellfish, mussels and claws in the mud. I only have to be clever in how I take them.

 Year One - Day Twenty-Seven

[Recording Begins]

It's dawn now Witness. 

 I sit with a bundle of reeds across my lap, working them into a stiff cordage. The air still reeks of mud and rot, but my fingers remember the rhythm. Over, under, tighten, bend.

 A fish trap is only a basket with an open mouth and a cruel idea behind it. Let the water carry life in, make the way out too narrow, and food comes to you. It has taken me weeks of steady practice to gain the skill to make this crude thing. 

I work and talk because it helps keep my mind focused. The reeds squeak when I pull them tight. They will swell and hold once the water soaks them. I shape the mouth small, the body long, a cage for minnows or whatever else swims too close.

Down by the riverbank I plant sticks into the mud to form a funnel angled toward the shallows. The water pushes against my legs, warm and brown, tugging at each stroke. It will not look like much from above. It is little more than a jagged fence leaning into the current, but I hope it will guide the fish where I want them.

The rain mists down as I work. My back aches, my palms are cut, but I can already see it in my head. Trap after trap lined along the bank, each one heavy with frogs, crabs, fish. Enough that I do not have to walk miles through flooded grass for a single meal. Enough that I can sleep without my stomach waking me.

Nan would smile, I think. “Hands busy, boy. Make the land work for you.”

So I weave, and I plant more sticks, and I tell you, Witness. This is the work that keeps me alive.

Year One - Day Twenty-Eight

[Recording Begins]

Good morning, Witness.

 The rain has eased and the river has turned to a road. From the top of the pod I watch them come.  

Giants in the water, with gray backs rolling like boulders, huge mouths with tusks flashing white when they rise to bellow. 

Hippopotamus. Whole families of them are pushing upstream with the flood and turning the brown current into their highway. 

They move with a slow certainty that makes me feel small. If one chose to climb this bank and get territorial, neither the hedge nor the pod would save me. Even lions and crocodiles give them space. I tell myself they will pass, they will find some new reach of grass and mud to graze. But it matters little because the mere sight of them reminds me how little place I have here.

The sun breaks through for an hour and shows me myself. My clothes are little more than rags now, torn by grass, stiff with mud, never dry. My boots hold, the leather cracking but still shielding my feet, yet I know they too will fail in time. When they go, if I don't make sandals then I will bleed in every step.

I feel the weight of it today. This survival game. Always being wet, always being hungry, always patching something or weaving or scraping. No rest, no comfort, no end but the one waiting out there. I slam my fist against the pod and it rings like a drum. For a moment I want to smash the spear, kick down the lean-to, walk into the flood and let something take me.

But I don’t. I sit on the pod, barefoot for a little while, and watch the hippos swim. They bellow while calves tumble beside their mothers and the river carries them on. I close my eyes and breathe. I curse, then I sip the last of yesterday’s coffee cold from the cup.

I tell you this, Witness:

I am still here.

Chapter Two — Day Twenty-Nine

[Recording Begins]

Today the world finally gave back. I waded out to the traps with my heart in my throat half expecting them to be empty. Inexoected to see them to torn apart by the flood or Scavengers. Instead, they were heavy. So heavy I nearly lost my footing in the current hauling them up.

Fish! Dozens of them! They thrash back and forth, silver and brown scales flashing like coins. For a moment I just stood there laughing like a fool while standing in water to my knees. I’ve lived on frogs and scraps for too many days. Today I eat! Thank you Mother Nature. 

I hauled them up to the pod in a sack of reeds, and now the fire smokes under the lean-to. A spit creaks above it, dripping fat onto the coals. 

The smell is sharp and clean, better than almost anything I’ve tasted since the crash. I close my eyes and pretend they are sardines from the tins we used to buy when I was a boy, when Nan would fry them in oil and serve them with paprika. I can almost hear her humming in the kitchen.

I will not eat them all. Some I will dry. The rest I will smoke even if the rain fights me over it. I need stores for the dry days that will come. 

Though tonight I will feast, Witness. Tonight I will sit with grease on my fingers and meat in my belly. So that for a few hours I will not feel like a lowly scavenger scratching at the edges of the food chain.

 Tonight I will feel human again.

Year One - Day Thirty

[Recording Begins]

Good morning, Witness. 

Thirty days. 

One month in this place where men should not be. I am thinner, harder, ragged down to my skin. My boots are the only thing still holding. My hands are cracked and calloused. I have food for today, a little for tomorrow. Still, I made it. 

Thirty days.

When I was a boy, Nan marked the change of the seasons with little rituals. She would sweep the floor three times at dawn, burn herbs at dusk, and pour the last of the harvest water onto the earth as an offering. I thought it was superstition. A bushwoman’s way of making sense of storms and drought. I laughed at her once. 

She only shook her head and said, “You’ll remember when the earth tests you.”

I do remember, Nan. The rains beat this pod like drums. The predators circle. The sky itself feels ancient and wrong. The earth is testing me every dawn. 

However tonight, I’ll mark the day the way you taught me. Not because I believe so much as I need every hand I can grasp in the dark, living or dead. Natural or supernatural. 

I’ll eat my fish, burn a handful of dried grass, and whisper thanks to the earth. Not as a scientist nor as a man out of his time. As your grandson, still alive after thirty days on a world that asks me everyday when I open my eyes:

""Are you fit to be here?"" 

Every dawn I see alive is the answer to that question.

[Recording Begins]

The sun has slipped behind the ridge and the shadow blackens the plain while water gleams in the last of the light. 

I lit a small fire. Not much, just enough to warm the fish I caught and to keep the dark eyes beyond the grass at bay.

I did it, Nan. I burned a bundle of dry stalks, held the smoke in my face, and whispered your words. Not the prayers. I can't remember those, but I do remember the rhythm. Three breaths, three sweeps of the hand, three thanks to the Earth. One for water, one for food and one for the breath still in me. It felt foolish. Then it felt like breathing.

The fish tasted different after. Not cleaner, not richer, but…earned. I told myself it was chemistry, the smell of smoke settling in, a trick of the mind. But my chest loosened for the first time in days. Maybe that’s all a ritual really is. Not magic. Not religion. Just a way to give weight to survival, to make the world answer back when you speak to it.

Thirty days. 

One full turn of the moon. The pod still stands, though it leaks. My body still moves, though it aches. My mind still holds, though it slips once in awhile. But I am hardened now and hardening more every day. This world demands from me that I prove constantly I deserve to be here. I believe I do. 

When the storms come again, I’ll know what to do. I will keep my hands busy. I will burn sacred grass and thank the earth while following Nan's single commandment:

""Endure""

Witness, mark this down. Tonight I crossed a line. Tonight I chose Nan’s way.

Author’s Note:

If you’ve walked beside Odwa for these first thirty days then thank you!  You’ve kept him company through hunger, rain, and silence. In doing so you’ve kept the fire of this story alive.

I didn’t write Witness to show human triumph over monsters or machines. I wrote it to remind us that our own origin story is the greatest HFY tale ever told. 

We didn’t become intelligent by accident or destiny. We became what we are because every sunrise an actual death world asked the same question of a few thousand clever, hungry apes always on the edge of extinction:

""Are you fit to be here?

Our ancestors answered with the first human inventions. 

Courage and defiance. 

They evolved the courage to face down the apex predators of a REAL death world and take their kills with nothing but sticks and rocks. They also evolved the defiance to endure when everything said they shouldn't. 

When the rains came, when volcanoes belched toxic gasses into the atmosphere, when one of them fell to accident or predation, they endured. 

Humanity was born when a few apes grew defiant enough to outwit a death world. 

Thank you for following Odwa this far. This story is far from over. His world will widen, he will make discoveries and grow. But he will also suffer, feel fear, hunger, disease and weakness. Every triumph is his answer to the indifferent and uncaring question imposed upon every lifeform, on every planet across our vast universe. 

""Are you fit to be here?"" 

The fact you are reading this from the comfort of your chair is testament to the answer our ancestors gave",1,1760462545.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

**TLDR:** We've been together for 11yrs, not the most happy, good, or smooth years. A lot has happened and now he says he is done and doesn't want me or the relationship anymore. Only wants to focus on building his business and wants to be alone and free. I am spiraling and don't know what to do or how to actually move on. We have a lot of finances tied together, my parents live with us, we own properties together. I just can't pick up and go. I don't even know what the first step is. 

**Context on us** \- I can be a total b\*tch and very mean especially when I am hurt or angry and I did say a lot of mean things to him to tear him down through these arguments over the years. I withheld affection and emotion, never told him how much i loved him and cared for him. I was just trying to prove a point that he needed to be better. This was my approach for a long time. I figured if he could see how upset or angry I was he would realize that things needed to be different. I am the type of person that needs to know how someone else feels about me, I am very insecure about this especially because I have been cheated on before and been in shitty relationships. Jim did/does not like to talk about his feelings at all. Every time we would try to discuss an issue or argument it would turn into a victim session where he would say things like ""he's not good enough, he can't make me happy"" etc. I would always try to say, if you just did this, or if you just did that it would make me happy - but nothing ever stuck. I always had to talk him off the ledge, even if the issue we were talking about was something that he did to hurt me. I would always threaten to leave or tell him to leave if he couldn't love me enough to be a better partner. He was always scared that he would come home and I'd be gone. These cycles would go on for a long time but I never actually left. Another thing to know about Jim is that he compartmentalizes EVERYTHING - I know a lot of guys probably do that, but Jim takes all of his feelings and puts it into a box and shoves it to the darkest corner.

**Me (43F) and my partner (43M)- let's call him Jim- have been together for 11yrs.** We met (in 2010) 3yrs before we started dating. The first year we met(we worked at the same company), we talked every day for hours. He was so open and honest about stuff, and would just talk and talk. He asked me out every day for coffee, drinks dinner, snacks - you name it, but I declined because I was not ready to get into anything as I had just come out of something pretty bad. At the end of that first year we had a falling out - he interviewed for the same job that I was interviewing for but didn't tell me. I felt betrayed. We stopped talking.

3years later I went for a promotion and got the job. My new job was in the same organization as Jim but we reported to different managers. Immediately we picked up where we left off. We started talking all the time, he would go out of his way to spend time with me, and he basically tried to make up for the falling out that we had. During this time, Jim was in a relationship which was coming to an end. We didn't do anything except talk a lot, meet up outside of work - I was house shopping and he came with me a few times to look at properties. I told him that he had to end whatever he had if he wanted to pursue anything with me and so he did. But this behavior would haunt me later on down the road. 

We officially started dating in 2014 and had the best year possible. We talked for hours, spent almost every waking moment together, we fell for each other so hard. We talked about getting married, and spending the rest of our lives together - thinking we found each other again for a reason. He treated me so well, bought me flowers every week, spoiled me, did anything and everything I wanted because he just wanted to see me happy. I bought my first house and we moved in together with plans for the future. During his time, he was obsessively in love with me to the point where he would say things like I was his world, he couldn't live without me etc. It felt like a lot of pressure because in the back of my mind I kept thinking that we had barely been together for a year and he was saying this. He also had a lot of childhood trauma, lots of bad blood with his parents, and I tried to help him through it only for it to backfire on me.

In Jan of 2015 we got engaged in Mexico. It was beautiful. But in Feb 2015 his grandmother passed away. He was extremely close to her and this hit him pretty had. Things started to go downhill after that. He was in a deep depression and had put himself into a dark place. He was mostly on auto pilot but we started arguing a lot - little stuff like how he left his shoes and socks all over the house, or just that he was very organized and messy. He started to be shady with his phone and would always place it face down. All of these things really made me feel uneasy and I ended up telling him that I didn't think we should get married. It was a big blow for him. I didn't realize how bad until much later.

We tried to make it work and we had good days and bad days and then in June of 2015 my heart/soul dog passed away. It was absolutely devastating for me and he wasn't there for me at all. Yes, he accompanied me to the vets office, and was there to help me take her body for cremation, but the love and support I needed was nowhere to be found. I would later learn that I resented him a lot for this.

As things continued that year, we tried to be as normal as possible but I could feel that our bond just wasn't as strong. At the time I felt like our finances with the house were too intertwined and I didn't want to walk away. I truly felt like if he could be the way he was when we first started dating everything would be totally fine.

2016 was a blur - but we did end up buying a different house together. We had talked early on about how my parents would come to live with us once they got too old to live on their own. The fighting got worse - we would argue about absolutely everything. *See, the issue with us fighting is once we start to have a conversation we would go in circles for HOURS - just to try and clarify something would take hours on end and it was exhausting and draining.(this is important for later).* One day I found a strange msg on his instagram from another lady - when I mentioned it to him, he deleted the entire conversation which set off my alarm bells. Why delete it? He said that he had been talking to this coworker about some of the issues in our relationship and he didn't want me to read that. I asked him to leave. He left the house and while he was gone I saw that he was messaging some other person via Instagram trying to get her to come meet up with him and his friend at the bar. He finally came home at like 3am but stayed in his car - I couldn't take it and went out and confronted him. The next few days were a blur, but obviously we decided to stay together. He stopped using social media and stopped posting about me or us. Our trust was completely shattered.

The next few years went on like 2016 - arguing, fighting, finding out that he was doing things behind my back. When this would happen he would always tell me that he loved me so much and that was the reason to stay together - and I always told him that love wasn't enough to make a relationship work. We needed to put in actual work. By this point, we had lost almost all intimacy, affection, physical closeness. The broken trust didn't help at all nor did Jim do anything actionable to fix it or earn it back. He begrudgingly started sharing his location, turned his read receipts on, and gave me his apple watch to show ""transparency"". but none of it actually worked because every time I had a gut feeling about something and looked, I found something.

Towards the end of 2017 he decided to leave the company that we had worked at together. I supported him in his decision and he found another job that paid well fairly quickly. He was there for a few months and then in 2018 I had a heart attack - the company he worked for was giving him a hard time for working ""remote"" since he was at the hospital with me. They ended up letting him go. He then decided he wanted to open up his own company. I supported him. I offered to help and do things for him to get things off the ground. He mostly declined, but did let me do a few small things here and there.

During this initial period of the new company he wasn't bringing in any money so I supported us both. I mostly blew through my savings to pay the mortgage and bills. I know he felt very inadequate and the fights weren't getting any better. Money was always a topic of discussion and it was an extremely stressful period. One of the arguments lead to him admitting to me that he had ""punished"" me for almost 5yrs because of me trying to help him with the issues with his parents. I was blown away - I had NO idea he would do something like this to me but it explained a lot as far as his behavior, lack of caring, and basically lack of boundaries. We still decided to stay together - always trying to figure out HOW we could be better with each other, but there was so much resentment and pain, broken trust, lack of emotional, and mental support that I was always on edge. He kept telling me that he just wanted to take care of me and he was building this company and business - first it was for me, then it was for us, and now it's his vision and he wants to change the world.

2020-2024 went by in a blur - bad times, some good times. As he continued to build his business he continued to shut me out. I wasn't involved in anything, didn't have a part in anything and he kept saying he had to do this on his own to prove to himself he could. It led to fights because I felt so hurt that he shut me out and didn't want to build something together with me. He told me it was because we could never work together because of how much we fight, and that he couldn't take the types of risks he needed if I was involved because I am too careful. I never went to his office. I did meet most of his coworkers (some had worked at the company where Jim and I met), others were new. But everything related to the business was totally cut off from me. As time went on I started to feel like I was going to be left in the dust with nothing since I had no part in what he was building. I felt that if we did end up going our own ways, he would be set financially and I would have nothing to show for the last 10yrs. This became another point of contention for us. After several heated conversations he did agree that he would always take care of me financially and to give me a piece of the company at some point if it was sold. To add, once the company got off the ground, he has been paying the mortgage and most of the bills. I still pay my share (car, credit cards, and all of the utilities for the FL house) Since 2019 we would always talk about buying a house in Florida since we were getting to the point of my parents not being able to stay on their own and I really wanted to get away from the cold weather. The plan was to eventually retire in Florida as well. We took several trips, probably looked at over 50 houses but didn't find the right one or the right price. He kept telling me during this time that he didn't know ""when"" the finances would be ready for us to make the purchase. We fought over that too. I felt that I had waited long enough since 2019 and that he didn't really want to make the move and wasn't being honest with me about it. He kept saying he did want to move but he didn't know when we could.

**2021 Detour:** When Jim and I had originally started dating I had told him that I didn't want kids - and at the time he had agreed with me that he didn't either - after his grandmother passed he started having thoughts about leaving a legacy and wanting to have kids. Due to my heart attack, I am unable to have kids or even freeze eggs - and of course in 2018 I didn't think we were solid enough to even consider having kids. In 2021 I tried to see if I could freeze my eggs, went through all the testing and everything only to be told I couldn't. The hormones could cause a bigger issue and possibly death. Jim of course took this very hard but wouldn't talk to me about it because he knew I was upset too. I remember about a year and half after this happened, and Jim and I were making no progress on ""us"", I asked him to commit to me - after about an hour of trying to get the truth out of him, he finally admitted that he didn't want to commit because he didn't know if he wanted to have kids or not. That broke me - I don't have a firm diagnosis on why I had the type of heart attack that I did, but from my research online, it was a mixture of hormones and severe emotional stress. Yes, I did blame him for my heart attack and now he was telling me that he wants what I **can't** give him.

That brings us to 2025 - earlier this year, I happened to go online and saw a great house in FL that had everything we needed - enough space to have my parents move in, no stairs, beautiful property. We had our realtor do a walkthrough and we loved the house. We flew down for the inspection and saw the property for the first time - we both agreed it was a good value and that we liked it - there were definitely some arguments regarding if we could afford it and if we should wait - but I kept thinking it was such a good deal and we probably wouldn't find something like that again. The money to make this work was super tight - I spent most of my savings on the downpayment and renovations to the property and we bought the house. We flew down several times after we bought it and spent time there to get the work done. He came and was involved in all of those trips. I thought everything was okay. Maybe having this second property could afford us some time and space that we never got before because neither one of us had anywhere to go. We ended up selling my parents home at the end of April and they moved in with us(not to the FL property). The plan was he would move down later, but I would go first and get everything setup, then move my parents and dogs in.

**2024 Detour:** In November of 2024, his mom passed away. While we were there caring for her I met a stray dog that I kinda fell in love with. He didn't want to have any more dogs - we already had one at home - but I really wanted another dog that I had a connection to. We ended up bringing the stray dog home a month after his mom passed. It took a bit of time to get the two dogs acclimated and friendly with each other, but once it happened everything was ok. Then we found out the stray dog had heartworms and needed to go on treatment. a month in, he snapped at the other dog. We had to separate them to the point where they couldn't even see each other or else they would go into barking frenzies. The dogs are still not fully getting along but we are trying to slowly bring them around each other. With this happening, Jim and I basically ended up split up in the house - he's upstairs with the one dog, and I am in the den and basement with the other dog. We essentially were forced into this weird separation which made things even worse.

Along with all of this, once the renovations on the house were complete, I was the one who kept flying back and forth to stay at the FL house and get things done. He said he couldn't leave because of work and had to be here to go into he office and meetings etc. It caused even more of a strain. While I was thinking that me being away would make him miss me or realize that he didn't like being away from me, it had the opposite effect. He felt like he could get his work done and not have to worry about talking to me.. he didn't have to stop throughout the day to text me to check up on me etc, and I just became more of a hard ass towards him. We obviously haven't moved to FL especially since the dogs aren't getting along. At the end of August, we had another one of our ""conversations"" while I was in FL and he basically told me he couldn't do this anymore - he was tired, he only wanted to focus on his work and that I was a distraction to him- he said that I clearly never loved him, and maybe even hated him and he was always mad at himself for hurting me the way he did over the years. Hearing him say that to me shattered me. I never actually thought that he would ever leave me, he always said he wouldn't, promised to love me and be with me forever and I had believed him. I spiraled - obviously we were physically apart but I just couldn't handle it. In the last 11yrs, I never one thought about how my life would be without him -  never imagined it, planned for it, pictured it - nothing. I just always thought we would figure it out and work on it. I immediately dropped my hard ass attitude and came to the realization that I did/do not want to live without Jim - to be honest, I don't even know how. We agreed to try one more time, and I thought things actually went really well - while we had some disagreements, we were able to work through them and talk to each other in a loving way - not screaming and shouting at each other. I requested that Jim share with me how he felt about me via some calendar invites that asked to ""fill the love cup"" - and while he completed most of these, he never did them all which would make me feel like shit - I'm not worth a 15 second msg? I made it a point to tell him every day how much i loved and cared about him, and how I didn't want to live without him - he was very confused by this at first because he truly believed that I didn't love him and hated him before this. But I kept at it and continued to show my feelings - something I hardly ever did before because I had built up walls around my vulnerabilities so he couldn't see them. But overall the month of September went by and we had dealt with each other in a way that we had never done so before - it was good, I was happy. I didn't know he was unhappy with it - he said he was uncomfortable and it didn't feel natural to him. He doesn't like talking about feelings and doing the cups made him feel like I was controlling him and making him talk about feelings. Even the few conversations we had during the month of September, while somewhat lengthy, were nowhere like before so I really thought we were making progress. I was wrong.

This past week was really bad - Jim had to go to London for a work trip and I was pretty upset that I couldn't go with him. While there, he barely communicated with me, went to event after event after event - was out until 2-3am networking. It was really starting to weigh on me and so I went through his email and I found a picture of some girl. I immediately called him and it was the middle of the work day for him - perfect example of what he doesn't want to deal with anymore - and started interrogating him with questions - I was triggered - was he cheating again? Was he involved with someone else? I couldn't control myself and had to know the answers to these questions right then and there. He just couldn't take it and again told me he couldn't do this anymore. Now we were 3k miles apart - we couldn't make a decision like this so I tried to talk to him into at least just waiting until he got home to talk. We end up texting while he's in flight coming back home and of course it's just him saying that this doesn't work anymore, all we do is fight etc Meanwhile I am over here panicking because WTF - I thought we just had a good month and we were making progress - but the whole time he wasn't even happy or on the same page. I picked him up from the airport and on the drive home we started to talk - he was just very adamant that he doesn't want to do this anymore, he doesn't feel for me the same way, he doesn't want to do the work, he doesn't have enough time in the day to be in a relationship, he doesn't want to try - he only wants to focus on work, being able to go to meetings and events as and when he pleases, not answer to anyone about anything work related, and he sure as shit doesn't want to talk about his feelings with me or listen to me about my feelings or thoughts. At first I didn't truly believe it - I just figured he was frustrated and overwhelmed. But, he really does mean it. He said he loves me and will always love me - but he can't be with me anymore. I begged, I pleaded, I couldn't/can't wrap my head around us not being together - but he keeps saying that he just doesn't want this. He wants to be alone. I keep thinking maybe it's someone else.. maybe he'd rather be with someone else, and he keeps telling me he doesn't want to be with anyone... period. He just wants to be alone to do his work. Rationally I can't understand this - my brain is just unwilling to understand how someone can throw away so much time and effort. While we never got married, we promised to be with each other through it all - good and bad - so how can he be okay with just never being with me again.

The tables have fully turned - at one point he was the one telling me that I was his whole world and he couldn't be without me and now it's me saying this to him and of course he is saying what I said back then - it's a lot of pressure, I should't let a person be that important to me etc. How can the person you envisioned to spend your whole life with not be that important? I'm the one saying that we should stay together because we love each other and now he's saying that he doesn't believe that love is enough anymore. That I told him love wasn't enough for so long that I finally convinced him. I haven't slept for four+ days, I've barely eaten anything and I'm trying to function as best as I can. It's so much harder because my parents are around all the time - its hard to talk or spend any time with Jim 1:1. He has gone into full robot mode, no feelings, nothing. He tells me that he doesn't feel anything and won't allow himself to let his feelings for me out because he needs to be a robot to be successful with work. I went upstairs this morning because I had to see him, hold him, have him be near me because when he's not I feel like I am going to explode - I feel crazy. I tried to talk to him again, beg him to stay with me, to try - he kept saying it just doesn't work, I don't want to try, I don't want to make an effort - but that he still loves me very much and always will. Of course he was annoyed that I started in on him first thing in the morning - and I also know that on some levels I am trying to beat him into submission.. but I just couldn't help myself. All night I kept trying to picture a day in my life without him - what does that look like, how would I function - and I just couldn't do it. How can someone that loves you just throw you away and walk away? I get that his work is a major distraction for him and doesn't allow him to reflect on anything emotional but what if us splitting up is a mistake? I know, if we are meant to be we will find each other, but my only way of moving on would be to absolutely decimate my feelings for him - there would be no coming back from that. I just want us to work through it, even though it's hard, and if it is a phase then at least we end up staying together at the end of it. I am sure that I am being irrational on so many levels but I don't know what else to do.

Maybe we are oil and water - where I want to have deep conversations, he doesn't even want to talk. The things that make me happy(when he tells me how he feels about me), make him unhappy(he doesn't want to talk about feelings). At this point, I know that I am willing to just swallow everything that I could possibly want or need just to stay with him. I know that isn't right, but I feel so desperate at this point.

Now my parents are my responsibility - I don't know how to untangle the web and even start to move forward. Not even sure what my first step should be. there are times I wish I could just disappear, or had never agreed to have my parents move in. I am at a total loss and all I can think of is I just want to be with Jim and make it work. I don't want to move my parents to FL and live there without him - especially not with all the memories we have of buying the house, working on the house and the plans we made. I also don't want to be alone in FL with no family or friends to help in case I need something with my parents. I am just stuck - I don't know what to do, how to move forward, how to let go, how to function without someone that I've been with for the last 11yrs. Since we just bought the house in March our realtor said it wasn't a good idea to put it back on the market right away.. but I don't think we will end up living in that house. We need to sell it in order for me to buy something else if I end up moving out with my parents.

I just feel so lost and confused. I'm trying my best to not text him or call him or just run up to him and beg him to reconsider, beg him to let the feelings out of the box and find a way to balance work and personal. I am terrified that he's going to leave me, find someone else, be super successful with his business and forget all about me. A lot of my other thoughts are very irrational and I know this.

I know this post is super long and I have left out a lot of other details and things that have happened between us - I mean 11yrs is a long time. But like I said in the beginning, my thoughts are all over the place.. I just needed to get them out. If you made it this far, thank you in advance!",2,1760462448.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

The secret is in how I did the beans

I started with a whole pound of store-bought standard blend Starbucks beans. Right from the front, so it was the oldest one on the shelf..

And that was probably a year maybe a year and a half ago. Then I opened the bag and day after day removed about 60 grams of beans until there was about a quarter pound left. Then I let it sit in a closed cupboard with a chip clip restricting some airflow but not all for about a year

Had my second brew today with the same Blue Tokai Silver Oak blend. Still used my trusty Indian mixer grinder (because I’m not dropping another ₹5k on a burr grinder… yet). When I ground the beans, I got that same intoxicating punch of aroma but weirdly, the ground powder and the brew itself didn’t smell as strong this time. Maybe I’m getting used to the smell. The beans themselves still smell the same.

But here’s the twist, it tasted better than yesterday’s. The color was gorgeous rich brown with this subtle dark orange tint that looked like it came straight out of a café commercial. The body was smoother, the flavor more balanced, and there was just a light residue at the bottom of the cup nothing tragic, just a bit of “authentic texture.”

It didn’t have that wild aromatic explosion from day one, but the taste? Way more refined. I think I’m finding the sweet spot in timing and grind size.

So yeah less nose ecstasy, more flavor maturity. The kind of trade-off that makes you feel like you’ve actually learned something about coffee instead of just drinking brown liquid for survival.

What concerns me with the speed I am going the 250 gm Blue Tokai will last only 13 days more. I mean I have started my brewing journey with speciality coffee. I don't want to switch to cheap beans for quantity and be disappointed. I would like to ask are there any brands specialty or not that are pocket friendly and decent enough?

(PS: I still catch myself sniffing the beans like a maniac. It’s fine. Everything’s fine.

What do you think?,"Hi guys, hope everybody feels okay. I just have a question because my brain wants to shut off after so many guests leaving weird requests. I thought that for a short stay such as 3 days, what we leave in the apartment was enough but I guess am wrong here, and of course this guest will be leaving a bad review. Here it is the conversation:

Guest 01:  
Hi there - my wife was telling me there are very few basic supplies in the apartment. She said only a few laundry detergent pods. Can you please let us know if there are more somewhere.

Host:  
Hello J and J!  
  
As we clearly share in the listing description, we leave a starting supply of a lot of different items for all our guests, but the guests will have to re-stock as needed.  
  
We leave coffee, creamer, sugar, salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, laundry pods, dishwasher pods, paper towels, toilet paper, soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, etc.

Guest 01:  
Pretty disappointing. We’ve rented units for years and specifically in this complex. Never have we seen such a limited supply. But if that’s your position, we’ll deal with it.

Guest 02:   
Hi there. We came home and the door was unlocked. Was someone in the unit today? We have double checked that it’s locked when we leave so this is concerning to me.

Host:  
Hello J, how are you? We didn’t sent anybody to the unit today. This is the activity information from the lock of the unit so you can check by yourself

\[Screenshot of the electronic keypad with the activity\]

(In response of Guest 01) Hello J, we’re sorry that you feel this way. We always leave toiletries, pantry and laundry items so our guests feel comfortable to start their stay and until now we didn’t receive any complaints about it and were transparent about everything in our listing description as well.

Host (night before check-out):  
Hello J!  
  
We hope you’ve enjoyed your stay with us. Just a quick reminder that your check-out is tomorrow at 10:00 AM.  
  
Here are a few important check-out instructions:  
  
🔸 Turn off all lights and appliances.  
  
🔸 Set the A/C to 75°F on cool mode before leaving.  
  
🔸 Please close all windows and balcony doors.  
  
🔸 Place all used towels on the bathroom floor.  
  
🔸 Return the keys and/or access cards to the reception or the staff at security gate.

Thank you again for staying with us — we hope to host you again soon!

Guest 02:   
Tbh we stay in this complex and our family owns 2 units. We have never had an experience this bad. I have pictures from our arrival and there was food and playing cards in the floor under the table. So the unit was clearly not cleaned properly before we came, there was 1 extra garbage bag, 3 detergent pods, the bare minimum. I know you stated that you leave what is a “start” but we have never had this in any other unit and we have rented many times. In fact we are back in February and March. So I will not be writing a positive review. So sorry.

Host:  
Hello Mrs Jordane, how are you? This is A speaking to you.  
  
Can you share with us the picture of the food and playing cards under the table? So we can share this as a feedback to our cleaning team.  
  
Also, I wanted to apologize for the experience that you had in our home, we're proud to have multiple positive reviews and try to accomplish all our guests expectations.  
  
Said that, we leave toiletries and extra things for our guest to start their reservation and considering their lenght of their stay. As yours was just 3 days, we consider that leaving three laundry detergent pods for three washes, three dishwasher pods for three washes, a trash bags on the kitchen trash and a extra one (because we take care of the trash after your stay), salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, a whole bottle of dish soap, coffee, creamer, sugar, an extra roll of toilet paper in each bathroom, whole bottles of shampoo, conditioner, body wash and hand soap, cleaning supplies and even extra towels for the maximum occupancy of our apartment and pool/beach towels so you and your guests can enjoy the apartment is enough for a short stay.  
  
As you can see in our reviews, none of our guest have complained about our supplies, but we welcome your feedback and we will do better for our next guests based on your reccomendations. We hope you have a safe return home.

Guest 02:  
There is no need to list all the things you leave. You listed it in your last message to my husband as well. I am well aware of what was there. Honestly, like I said, we have stayed in multiple units and we own 2 of our own. This was not what we normally experience and in the past when we have asked if there is more of something, they just uber it to us no questions asked. It’s called good customer service. Pictures are attached of the dirty floor and also of the limited supply of random paper and plastic cups.  
Have a nice day.

  
Context to their booking: 

The apartment can holds up to 8 people, we leave a bunch of stuff, like ground coffee nespresso coffee, paper plates, plastic cups, children sits, extra towels, extra cleaning supplies and everything, and there was just 4 people staying for 3 days. We run multiple properties and this one is the far of them all so sending a team member or even send an ""uber"" for laundry pods is expensive and the costs for the income from the reservation will considerably drop as this was a discounted reservation. 

At this point I think if is true that they have other units there, this reservation was made on purpose just to leave a bad review because I check the inspection video from the cleaning team and it was great (we make videos before and after) and now the ladies told me that they used all the towels and left makeup stains... so what do you think? I'm in the wrong. They said they attached photos but they didn't send anything. ",1,1760462214.0,airbnb_hosts,26,0.6,False

1o6lhv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1o6lhv0/almost_back_to_100_after_toupet_fundoplication_of/,Almost back to 100% after Toupet Fundoplication of all things,"Just wanted to make this anecdotal, non-scientific post for anyone who may be in my shoes...

While I still have some dizziness (complications from not being able to tolerate PPIs), I've been struggling with GERD/Gastritis for the better part of 2 years now. PPIs helped but I don't tolerate them well (always crazy side effects with lasting damage). I got diagnosed with chronic gastritis when I started having stomach burning and pain after being given antibiotics for what they incorrectly thought was ""invisible pneumonia"". (Kaiser medical! shout out)

I had a toupet fundoplication 3 weeks ago for my GERD, and over this period of time for the first time in 2 years my stools are normal, my energy is increasing, I haven't needed meds - and most importantly - can ingest most alcohols with zero stomach burning now. Coffee on an empty stomach? Have at it. The improvements to my gut health are wild. Even the surgeon doesn't quite seem to believe me, as this is intended for hiatal hernia/reflux only, but he did suggest that perhaps the backsplash of the acid back into the stomach was my main cause for irritation.

  
Anyway, figured I'd share this for some one searching this thread anxiously some day.

1o6lhfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1o6lhfm/the_phantom_limb/,The Phantom Limb,"From the outside, I imagine my life looks like a well-tended garden. I have the career I studied for, the high school sweetheart I married, a handful of wonderful kids, and a home nestled in a community so wholesome it feels like the last vestiges of Americana. But even in the most idyllic landscape, there can be a fault line running deep beneath the surface, unseen.

Ours formed years ago, when my wife was with someone else. We were young. We went to therapy, we talked until our voices were hoarse, and I told her that I had forgiven her. I told myself I had forgiven her. I’m built that way; forgiveness comes easily to me. Some might call it a weakness, a feckless need to please. But forgiveness is a strange and hollow thing when trust has been shattered. It doesn’t erase the memory, it just papers over it. And no matter how many layers you add, you can always feel the uneven surface underneath.

A part of the blame, I shouldered myself. I knew I had been distant back then, lacking the words for a difficult time in her life. I didn't actively hurt her, but my quiet, stoic nature must have felt like a locked door. So, I spent the next decade trying to make up for it. I threw myself into becoming the man I thought she wanted. I became a runner, got into the best shape of my life, and learned how to dress. I actively grew my career, marching my family into the fiscal purgatory of the comfortable middle class. I prioritized material things for us: new cars, a bigger house, all the creature comforts a millennial family is supposed to want. The quiet in our house grew loud, but I drowned it out with the noise of my own ambition. My new mission was to succeed so completely that our marriage couldn't possibly fail.

Then, at work, I made a friend. She was married, too, with a child the same age as mine. It's funny to remember how things started - it never feels like some monumental event at the time. It was a shared joke in a work chat, a conversation that lingered a little too long. With her, I felt a spark of recognition, a feeling of being seen that had become a distant memory in my own home. I told myself it was harmless, we were only friends. But I was lying to myself. Every text I sent was a small betrayal, a step further away from the man I thought I was. When she kissed me, it wasn't a surprise. It was an inevitability I had been walking towards for months.

The fling was short, and it left me disoriented. How could I, a man who had curated a ""happy"" life, do something so reckless? She eventually gave me an ultimatum: choose her completely, or not at all. The choice was never really a choice. I couldn’t blow up my life. But I couldn’t answer the question that haunted me afterward: were my feelings for her not strong enough to justify the wreckage, or was it because I was fundamentally incapable of causing that kind of deliberate pain to my family?

That question led me down a rabbit hole, to the confessional corners of the internet. Was this who I was now? A man who has affairs? I posted an ad, more as a morbid experiment than with any real expectation. After a few false starts and a family medical emergency that nearly made me delete my account, a message appeared.

It started with a picture. She was so beautiful my first thought was that it had to be a fake. I let the message sit for a day, my heart pounding in my chest, opening my phone dozens of times just to look at her soft, kind eyes, before I found the courage to reply.

What followed wasn't a conversation - it was the beginning of a new, separate life. We moved to a different app, and the text messages became a torrent, hours of conversation that felt more real than my waking life. We unburdened ourselves, confessing the quiet disappointments of our lives, but the focus was on what we wanted now. She was clear: she needed intimacy while her husband shut her out. I wasn't sure what I wanted, and I think that lack of intent is what allowed everything to wash over us, beautifully and recklessly.

In that rush of honesty, the full truth of her life surfaced. She told me about her husband, and not just that he cheated repeatedly, with a cruelty that involved convincing her she was paranoid for even suspecting it. She described the landscape of her daily life, life with a man who was content to exist across a profound, unbridgeable distance. A man who could talk endlessly about work but would go silent if she tried to share a feeling. A partner who saw her tears not as a sign of pain, but as an inconvenient problem to be solved.

The way she described his rigid adherence to his work, his inability to read her emotional cues... it was all so familiar. It echoed the same invisible walls my own family had navigated for years with my brother. When I told her it sounded lonely, that my brother was on the spectrum and his behavior sounded similar, I wasn't accusing her of hiding anything. I just wanted her to know that I understood.

She never confirmed it. When I’d mention it, a quiet space would hang in the chat before she’d steer the conversation back to the infidelity. I never pushed. I understood her refusal - to give his behavior a name would be to risk excusing it, and she was done with excuses. The cheating was a separate, deliberate wound. Seeing her refuse to use it as a shield made me see her not as a victim, but as a survivor.

Our first meeting was supposed to be a quick coffee. Instead, it felt like coming home.

From there, it blossomed. Our bond wasn't forged only in the solemn ground of shared pain; we became each other's oasis. She was a gushing fountain of warmth and comfort that washed over me every time she sent me a voice note, the timbre of her silky tone emanating from my ears to my chest. With her, I discovered a lightness, a joy I hadn't realized I'd been living without. We had the same offbeat sense of humor, quickly developing a shorthand of inside jokes. We built playlists for each other, a secret language of songs that said everything we couldn't in our daily lives. She became more than a lover; she was my best friend, the person I wanted to tell everything to first.

With her, I was no longer performing. She was kind, cut from the same people-pleasing cloth as me, but with an emotional intelligence that felt like a compass in my own fog. It felt like finding a missing piece of myself. We started to fantasize about a future, a different time that would be just for us, that felt more tangible and real than the life I was currently living. I had no plan, but for the first time, I felt like I had a direction.

Reality has a brutal way of asserting itself. My wife’s struggle with alcohol, a storm that had been gathering for years, finally broke. The benders became more frequent, more dangerous. Drinking and driving, passing out before noon, missing our kids' events. Was my affair the cause, or just another symptom of a house that was already crumbling? The question is irrelevant. It was happening, and the shame I felt was a physical weight. My confident handle on life, on my carefully constructed world, began to crumble.

The two worlds could no longer coexist. The joy I felt with my soulmate was inextricably linked to the chaos at home. I began to believe the only way to fix my life, to atone for my part in its destruction, was to let go of the only person who truly knew me.

Our relationship wasn't perfect. We were two flawed people who made mistakes. But she was perfect for me. Every part of her—her smile, her voice, the heavy breath she took when we held each other—felt like it was made to fit into the empty spaces of my own soul.

I know no one in my situation deserves pity. I am the architect of my own pain. I will make my life work; I always do. But for the first time, I am living with a regret so substantive it feels like a part of my own body. It's not just for myself, for the ghost of a life I’ll never have. It's for her. For the pain I caused her, and for the possibility that by entering her life, I held her back from finding a happiness she could have had sooner with someone else, someone whole.

Sometimes I think there’s a darkness in me, a detachment that allows me to compartmentalize my life, to rationalize my betrayals. Or maybe that's just a story I tell myself to bear the weight of carrying all this scar tissue alone. I chose my family. I chose the life I had built. But in doing so, I had to amputate a part of myself. There is a phantom limb where she used to be, an ache that flares up in the quiet moments, when I'm driving home from work, or lying in bed next to my sleeping wife.

When I’m old and gray, I wonder if I will ever forgive myself as easily as I’ve forgiven everyone else. I doubt it. I just know that I will think of her every single day, and I will always, always wish I was with her.",2,1760461990.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

 I (19F) and my ex (21M) 
have been in an on  and off long distance relationship for about two years. We’ve never met in person, but the connection was so deep. Every time we broke up, it was mostly because of me I had issues with honesty and hid things from him. He, on the other hand, values honesty above all and has trust issues because of what happened between us .

Recently, after a few months of no contact, we broke it and started talking again. We both admitted we missed each other. We agreed that we’re not getting back together seriously , it's done for it , just talking because we still care and can’t fully let go .


he told me he had several one night stands during our time apart, and also a close female friend. I told him about 2 talking stages online, but I didn’t mention that I once went on a real life coffee date with someone. It was innocent, nothing happened, and we didn’t even click. I just didn’t want to share that because:

One . We’re not in a relationship anymore, so he isn’t entitled to every detail.


Two. He’s extremely judgmental and tends to call me names and degrade me whenever he’s upset.



We had a really deep conversation recently about how I hurt him in the past and how much it affected his ability to trust and be with anyone again . It actually felt healing  until I started feeling guilty for not mentioning the coffee date. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, so I ended up telling him everything yesterday.

He was furious. He said I’m disgusting, that I’ll never change, and that I lied again. 
I tried to explain that if I had told him there was something but I wasn’t ready to talk about it, he would’ve pressured me endlessly until I broke down. He admitted that’s true  he would’ve pushed. But he still said that doesn’t excuse me lying.

Now he’s demanding I send him pictures of the guy and tell him his name, but he won’t tell me why he wants them. He keeps pressing and I honestly feel so uncomfortable, but I’m almost at the point of giving in just to make him stop.

So that's why i posted..
Is he actually entitled to know everything?
And am I really this terrible, disgusting person he says I am?

However, he makes fun of my faith constantly & calls it a cult. Intimacy is a huge issue and it’s probably been the biggest issue for a long time. I felt more than nothing but a sex object for him since becoming Catholic, he refuses to do natural family planning and actively tries to push me to do things that I know are sinful with intimacy. I know there’s something called Material cooperation something something where if one spouse doesn’t condone the sin and the other spouse does the sin that they’re not guilty (because he wants to masturbate to me to finish, he legit cannot finish with me) but I’m at the point where I don’t even want to be intimidate at all. 

Every morning he has coffee, goes to the bathroom and then goes to the basement to masturbate to porn for an hour every single morning while I’m making his lunch and taking care of the kids. He doesn’t even take the trash out anymore. He doesn’t help at home. He does the bare minimum of anything while he’s home. 

We have a history of emotional abuse where he’s been emotionally abusive to me for years. We’ve been together 12 years and it’s gotten to the point where he’s so critical and mean to me constantly that when he is nice I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop. Also, he said some pretty insulting things about the bedroom department so between all the criticisms, him constantly being angry, his marijuana usage, & porn usage, I just wanna stop being intimate altogether, but I don’t know if that goes against Church teaching. I’m pretty done with our relationship and he’s the one that asked to sleep in separate bedrooms. He hasn’t actively done anything to do that but I’m kind of getting more and more on board with it because I don’t wanna break my marriage vows, but I really don’t want to be physically involved with him anymore. He even suggested getting a girlfriend or being polyamorous. He’s a sex addict and I’m done with the roller coaster. The emotional aspect is dead because he puts in no effort on that end anyway, so is it bad if we just live together separately so we can take care of the kids and just leave it at that?

So I was working a corporate job at Delhi since 2016(around 2 years) but still, My earning was very limited So I was thinking about earning some extra money. So I decided to do some extra work which can help me to make money and have fun also. I decided to be a Male Masseur and provide Body Massage Only to Ladies in Delhi at their home as well as Call Boy (PLAYBOY).

But that was not so easy and I had no idea about how to start the journey, I went to several Spas But not succeeded. So I posted several classified and ads about My services on some sites like Vivastreet and Skokka and Locanto.

And that thing worked for me. I got several calls from Females for home service. A lady also called me to discuss massage. She wanted to have a massage at her place. we discussed it on the phone.

She wanted to try my Body Massage service. So she asked me to meet at Rajeev Chauk, Delhi. I said I need to go to my room to bring some stuff to give you better service but she said today I just want to meet you over coffee and want to talk about some personal things after that I will let you know when I will be ready for your service. I said Ok. I left my office and took the metro for rajeev chauk.

I reached at Rajeev Chauk Metro Station, after 45 minutes and Called her. She picked and said that she was stuck in traffic and she will reach there in 10 minutes. I was waiting suddenly a Lady with a Car stopped in front of me and Said ""Lucky??"" Right?

I said ""Yes"" and sat in the Car.

I was feeling glad to see her because She was a damn beautiful and pretty lady. her boobs size was 36, the waist was 30, and the ass was 38 We left for CCD.

We reached and Ordered Coffee than she started talking about her, she told me that She is a working woman and doing a well-paid job in the government sector. she also told me about her married life and husband. She said: ""My husband belongs to a very high profile family and his father is working in HCS( Haryana Civil Services) But her husband is unemployed and also a traditional boring person. He sleeps at 7.30 PM. He never talks to me and also doesn't like to listen to me. He spent my salary and I have no issue with this but he doesn't care about What I want. He never pampers me"". She became emotional and The tears started flowing from her eyes. I said, ""Calm down"". I understood what she wants. She also asked about myself, my profession, and my education. I told her everything about myself. Then she said I need some relaxation from this type of stress. I want a good listener who can listen to me and understand my emotions. i want a hug and want to kiss someone. I want someone who can pamper me.

I was listening very carefully..but her emotions became limitless. So I said, Please Calm down. This place is not good to talk about such things. We should go somewhere else so that we can sort out these things and I will give you everything whatever you want to have from my side.

We have talked about Many things and Now she trusted me because I just saw her face and eyes and tell her that what she wanted. She told me all these things that she wanted to say to someone. She was very happy now because she found a good listener as she wanted.

She was happy to hear that I understood her feelings.

So she said, let's go somewhere else. After some time see bring me at one of her places.

She relaxed on her sofa and started talking again and started crying. After a few minutes of listening to her. I said don't weep please and let me make you relax.

We went to her bed than she said it's very weird and strange for me. But I hold her hand. And said don't worry I will make it comfortable for you.

She said ""It's a very weird feeling for me, i never did these things with another man, and then she closed her eyes.

I put my lips on her lips and started kissing and she was also smooching me. Slowly I was kissing on her neck and licking her shoulder and neck area.she was moaning and said it's tickling. Please lick my whole body I love it when you are doing this. So I started licking her neck again and slowly I push her left side boob so she stopped me.

She said"" Not Now. I love Slowly""

So I sucked her Tongue and bite slowly on her neck. she moaned loudly. and then I ask her to remove her top. She removed her top. She wore a red bra. I started licking on her backside and started biting on behind her neck. and slowly I push her boobs. this time she holds my other hand and started pushing her another boob with my hand. then I laid down and pulled me upon her. then i started sucking her nipples one by one. she was moaning louder and louder and slowly I started rubbing her thighs which makes her turn ON and I insert my hand into her panty. She was terribly Wet. I started fingering on her pussy and i found her g spot and started rubbing. she was moaning too loudly and after sucking and fingering her around 20 minutes, she squirted.

Than I started kissing and licking her waist and navel and than I reached at her pussy and i spread the clitoris and insert my tongue into her pussy and started licking. She again started moaning and started moving her butt.

I inserted my tongue deep into her pussy and licked G spot which makes her turn on. and after 20 minutes of licking, She said "" I can't tolerate more, Please fuck me now""

Then I put her legs on my shoulder and insert my dick slowly. It was little hard but the pussy was wet so i inserted my dick into her pussy in one time. She started shouting and ask me to hold on.

I stopped and waited for a minute and than she said""now fuck me"". and i started fucking. after fucking of 5 minutes in this position, She said""I want to sit on your dick""

and She came to my dick and sat on it and started moving. Now she was enjoying more and I was also enjoying too much  and she also started kissing me.

She did this at 10 minutes and than she said to fuck in Doggy style. I fucked her in Doggy style as well.

We enjoyed a lot on that day. it was 12, O Clock and she said now you should go. Se booked a Cab for me and gave me 1000 rs also.

I said what is it for, I didn't give you Body Massage?? She said You need money , I need love. Please keep it..and Next time I will call you for Body Massage than I will cut the money from your service and also blinked at me. 

I laughed and kept the money and went to my place..

November 23rd, 1 year prior.

Myself, Ryan, and an incredibly sweaty and disoriented Luke were all crammed into my bedroom. Ryan was sitting on my bed, fixed between the space where my bed met the wall, with pillows supporting his head and back. I was on the floor sitting to Luke’s left, and he was curled sitting upright in the fetal position. He was leaning slightly over with his head resting on my shoulder. Ryan and I were bundled up in what was likely all the bedding we had in the apartment, including throw blankets from the couch in the living room. We had the window open and it must have been thirty something degrees outside. Addiction is evil.

Luke however, was stripped down to his red boxer briefs, sweating profusely and claiming that it was still too hot to bear. He had been sick for days. This was our third shot at getting Luke sober in the past two years. It had to stick this time. We could feel the phone calls coming. Telling us that he was in the hospital with a failing liver, or that he had slipped himself into a coma of some kind.

“I can’t do this.” Luke told me. He pushed the words out of his lungs through waves of nausea. “It’s too much, man. I feel like I’m drowning and burning to death at the same time.” I believed him. I could see it all too well painted all over his entire being. I couldn’t stand to see my friend in such a state.

“We’ve got you, buddy. We’re gonna get you through this.” Ryan told him reassuringly. “If you start to drown, we’ll jump in after you. Always.” 

“My stomachs in knots man. I’m gonna try and hit the toilet.” Luke told us. He was starting to turn a milky white and green, and my body ached in sympathy as he tried to get to his feet. 

“Let me give you a hand, buddy.” I offered. I set his arm around my shoulders and heaved with every muscle I could activate. When we finally got up, I felt the entire weight of his massive frame, like he was complete dead weight. We took a few steps before he went completely limp, falling out of my grasp. Somehow, he caught himself on his hands and knees. He began to violently dry heave, his back arching up and down as his demons fought their way out of him. I kneeled down and rested my hand on his back, rubbing up and down. When it finally made its way out, the vomit was almost black, thick and viscous. It slopped into the carpet like warm hot glue. *Holy fuck. That can’t be normal* “Luke, buddy, I think we might need to go to the hospital.”

“No.” He said sternly. The serious tone of his voice caught me off guard. “No more doctors telling me I need to go to rehab. If I can’t do this on my own I don’t want to do it all.” He was silent for a moment. “I think I just need a cold shower.” This sounded like insanity to me. I couldn’t fathom how he could feel the need to get even colder, but we obliged.

We had bought a shower chair for him, and once we got everything set up, I opted to stay in the bathroom with him just in case he needed something. Much to his annoyance, but he knew I wouldn’t back down.

After about fifteen minutes, Ryan poked his head in.

“Wanna smoke?” Ryan asked me.

“I thought we were trying to quit.” I said with a tired drone in my voice.

“Yeah…I think we deserve one after today.” I couldn’t disagree with him. It had been one of our rougher recovery attempts with Luke. I looked back at the shower curtain. “Holler if you need something, man.” He didn’t respond.

We sat outside on the balcony of the apartment in tattered red and green lawn chairs as we lit our cigarettes. Ryan had a concerned look on his face as he blew out small tentacles of smoke that clung to his face as the rose and then slowly faded away.

“Jay…I don’t know how much longer I can do this.” He told me. I looked over at him and I could see tears swelling in his eyes.

“What’s going on, buddy?” I asked him, concern hovering through my tone. Tears started to stream down his face.

“I don’t want to be an asshole, man. I love Luke more than anyone…but I just can’t stand to watch him do this to himself. I want my friend back, Jay. But this…this is getting to be too much.” I’d never seen Ryan this torn up.

“What we’re doing for Luke…I don’t think anyone else could.” I said. “It HAS to be us. We’re all he has. You can’t give up on him now.” His expression changed violently. “…that came out wrong. I don’t think you’re giving up. I just really think we can do this.”

“No, Jay. You can do this. I’m not like you, man. This is…it’s…I feel like I’m melting.” The levies broke, and he began to convulse and sob. “I j-just can’t keep this up. Fuck. It’s tearing muh-me a-apart. Me and Emma are getting pretty serious. B-but…how am I-I supposed to even begin to think of settling down with all of this happening? Fuck me. I feel so fucking selfish.” I could feel his soul being ripped in two. I understood what he meant. Wanting to build something while you’re watching everything you’ve ever had fall apart. “My entire world is crumbling right now, Jay. And I don’t even have the guts to fix it.”

We sat in silence for a few moments.

“…I I can handle Luke for the rest of the day…I think you should go get some lunch, take a good nap, and maybe take Emma to a movie or something. Get Luke’s self induced debacle off your mind for a while.”

“I can’t let you do this alo-“ I cut him off in the middle of what he was saying.

“Ryan.” I locked eyes with him, “I got this.” We stood up, and I wrapped my arms around him. I repeated myself. “I got this.”

——

Present day

Ryan moped all the way to the hospital, like each step cost a piece of his spirit. As we made our way up to the front doors, I took in how dilapidated the hospital seemed. There were four main towers of brown brick reaching up into the sky like it was clawing at the gray overcast. Each had two rows of windows stacked to the top floor— some whole, some shattered and boarded up like bandages over wounds that wouldn’t heal. There were large sections of clean crisp brick, and others that looked like they had weathered years worth of storms, like the administration had decided to renovate but never got the chance to finish.

“He’d be in the ER right?” Ryan’s voice cut through my observation. 

“It depends on how long ago he ended up here. He could’ve been admitted into long term. But we should check there first.” I said, approaching the automatic doors. I heard the sensor click, but the doors remained sealed. “Shit.” I looked into the parking lot behind me. There were two cars and a truck, nowhere near enough to say this place was currently staffed. I peered back inside. “It’s so weird, the lights are on and everything. Where is everyone?” I read the lettering on the doors, “PUSH FOR EMERGENCY”. I placed my hands on the glass, pressed hard, and like magic, they opened inwards. Glancing over at Ryan, I snickered, “I’ve always wanted to do that.”

Oceans of white tiles stretched as far as the eye could see, reflecting fluorescent lights that hum constantly—a sound you didn’t notice until you did, and then you can't stop noticing. A few wheelchairs scattered throughout the waiting room like abandoned shells. Like the people who needed them simply stood up and walked away.

Rows of stationary blue chairs lined the walls. Tables separated every five seats—practical, designed for social distancing or personal space or some administrative decision made years ago by someone who never sat in them.

Paintings hung on the walls. Forests. Creek beds. Rivers. Landscapes meant to be soothing, calming. They made the white walls feel less baron but somehow more lonely. The TV that hung in the corner looped white noise and static. Visual snow falling forever. The sound of it wasbarely audible under the fluorescent hum, a soft hiss like something breathing.

There was no one behind the glass panes that lined the front desk. The chairs were empty. The computers were dark. No coffee cups. No half-eaten lunches. No signs that anyone was here and stepped away. 

As I scoured through the glass, my eyes caught on something. A scratchy red arrow pointing to something taped to the desk next to the keyboard. An envelope. Dirty and worn—the same yellowed, tea-stained quality as the one Luke sent them.

“Hey.” I got Ryan’s attention, and pointed down to it. “I think that’s for us.” He let out a sigh.

“I hate it when you’re right.” He said. We walked around the corner and through the door that read “STAFF ONLY”. I reached down, hesitated for a moment, and then ripped the envelope from the desk. The bottom of it must have ripped in the process, as something fell out and hit the ground with a light “clink”. I looked down at the ground between my feet. A house key with a strange tag lie alone on the floor. I bent down and picked it up. The tag read *1315 Scottsdale*

“That’s weird.” I thought aloud. I held it up for Ryan to see, then put it in my pocket. I turned the envelope over, and noticed paper inside. I opened it up the rest of the way, pulling a folding piece of hospital stationary out and setting the envelope back on the counter. Slowly, I unfolded it.

*Patient left this behind. Please leave in lost and found.* I flipped it over.

Perplexed, I handed it to Ryan.

“What the fuck?” He said, confused.

“I….I don’t know.” I answered. I began to feel an unspoken sense of urgency relaying between the two of us. He handed it back to me, and I stuffed it in my jacket pocket. “C’mon.”

There was no other way to do this than the hardest. We agreed that we would just go room to room, floor by floor until we found him. Thankfully, the double doors that lead back into the depths of the ER weren’t locked. They swung open automatically with a mechanical hum as we stepped in front of them. A long, empty corridor stretched out in front of us. 

Each room in this hall held a combination of the same things. As I walked in I could see an empty bed left in the upright position, a blank monitor, and no other signs of recent life. I peeked my head out of the room I was in.

“Ryan? You got anything yet?” I yelled down the hallway. He poked of a doorway down the hall.

“No…still nothing. We’re fucked like we have been this whole time.” I could feel the impatience in his voice. I started down the hallway to meet Ryan.

But as I made my way down the hall, a faint, metallic noise caught my attention. It kind of sounded like it was coming from above us. I focused my attention on the ceiling, and could tell that whatever it was was coming from behind me. *Oh this can’t be good.* I thought. The sound was getting closer. As I turned, I could see dust falling off the ceiling tiles as something was moving above them. I followed the trail as whatever it was was rushing over my head. Ryan was just stepping out of the room he’d been checking. 

“STOP.” I screamed at him so harsh that my throat hurt as the words left it. “Stop fucking moving.” He didn’t argue with me as he froze in place. The last bit of tile crumbs settled at Ryan’s feet and the scratching stopped. He slowly turned his gaze upwards. My body moved before my thoughts could comprehend it. I sprinted at him full force, like a track star on his last leg of a four hundred meter dash. When I reached Ryan, I placed both of my hands on his chest, and shoved him as hard as I could. He lifted up off his feet and fell backwards onto his ass, catching himself by his elbows.

As I started to catch my breath, I felt a sudden sharp pain in my right forearm, accompanied by the sound of grinding metal. The sharp sensation made my lungs release the air trapped within them. I felt something snatch my arm up into the air. When I looked over at my arm, I could see that it was wrapped in barbed wire stretching all the way back to end of the hall, wrapping around the corner. My arm was suspended in the air by the strand of metal wire and I felt like it was being pulled out of the socket. I could feel each of the barbs digging deep beneath my skin. I traced it back to the corner at the end of the hallway.

Before I could react further, I turned my eyes back to Ryan, and the sight in front of me horrified me to my core.

Ryan’s arms and legs were completely entangled in a sporadic mess of barbed wire. He was fixed with his right leg bent backwards, his foot pressed flat against his back, the other was stuck fully extended above his head. His right arm was wrapped around his face just above his nose, blocking his vision, with the other trapped firmly at his side. Steel barbs stuck not only to his skin and ripped patches of his clothes, but to itself, grinding into him in tight knots. I will never forget the violent screams he uttered.

He was upside down, pinned against the wall, blood leaking down onto his face and arms, dripping onto the floor beneath him. The wires lead into two massive holes, one in the ceiling and one in the floor. The sound of grinding grew louder as he was starting to slowly drift down the wall. 

“RYAN!” I called out to him. I felt hopeless, and it boiled my blood. Suddenly, loud crashes began to cut through the hallway, each one followed by the sound of what I can only describe as a broken ventilator. Humming and wheezing so loud it hurt my eardrums. Something was…coming towards us. It had to be, my mind couldn’t rationalize it any other way. I looked over at my arm tangled in the wire and then down the hall. 

My attention became acutely focused on the other end of barbed wire. I could feel vibrations funneling along it, sending bolts of pain through my arm. Suddenly, a dirty black gloved hand connected to a pale bloodstained arm reached out from around the corner at the other end of the hall. It fiercely latched onto the barbed wire, and another followed closely behind it. Hands with too many fingers slowly collapsing around the wire. 

Fear and rage seeped through my bones. I pulled my arm as hard as I could. The barbs began to rip and tear at my skin, blood seeping out of the wounds on my arm as I tugged.

Before I could fully tear my arms to shreds, I was released, the back pressure sending me flat onto my stomach. The impact pushed all of the air out of my lungs, and I wheezed and gasped for air as I rolled over. I peeked back down the hallway. Whoever was at the other end of the wire had completely vanished.

I looked over at the wall Ryan was hung next to. Only shattered ceiling tiles lay on the floor, surrounded by small puddles of blood. Skewed lines of blood leading down into the hole in the floor painted the wall.

“Ruh…RYAN!?” I forced his name out of my throat. 

His screams trailed off into obscurity.

I fell to my knees. Guilt and shock spilled into my soul, freezing me in place. Pouring into like water filling some poor drowning sould lungs. My heart felt like it was about to explode, and the veins in my neck were pulsating rapidly. Tears began to swell in my eyes. How could I let this happen? As I ripped my jacket to patch my arm, a familiar pairing of words hit me harder than ever before.

*I did this.* It raced in my head like rats on a wheel. Spinning faster, gaining weight and momentum. I sat there, soaking in shame for what seemed like forever. 

But then, a familiar voice rang down the hall.

“Jay.” It echoed and then passed me. Familiar, angelic and sad, it sung through my brain distorting how I perceived it. I raised my head, and searched for the source. A shadowy figure stood at the end of the hall. Shockingly still. Unnaturally still. The kind of stillness that makes you realize how much living things are always moving—breathing, shifting, swaying. Tall, towering over the doors, it gazed down the hall with a fierce focus, bright white eyes piercing through me with incredible focus. *What the hell?* It turned away, and almost floated to the right side of the hall, disappearing around the corner.

I let out a fierce gasp as I forced myself to my feet and began to sprint down the hall after it. The corridor seemed the stretch and contort longer and longer as I ran. I began to think I’d never reach the end, like the tiles were just a long treadmill. As I reached the end I turned the corner and looked frantically for the figure.

“Luke??” I got no answer. He was gone.

This hallway was only about six feet deep and a lone familiar red wooden door sat at the end. Without even thinking about what I was doing, I walked towards it. 

I reached for the handle, hesitating slightly. Cautiously, I placed my hand on it. The metal was warm, like someone had just opened it. I slowly peered my head in.

It was…my room? Back at our apartment. Empty except for the furniture. I looked behind me and the hospital was still there. When I looked back, Luke and Ryan were sitting in the corner beside my bed and my decorations had returned. Ryan had his arm around Luke and was rubbing his hand up and down on Luke’s opposite arm, the two of them wrapped in a blanket. The gesture was gentle. Protective. Luke was covered in sweat, shaking violently, and his head was buried in his hands. His shoulders bounced up and down with silent grief.

“RYAN! I THOUG-“ Warmth spread over me as I stepped in. Poured into me like sunlight. The pain in my arm slowly faded away.

“Hey, buddy. Wanna swap out with me so I can go get us some food?”

“Whah? What’s…” Snakes of confusion swirled around in my head.

“Thanks, man.” He said as he gave Luke a hug. “I’m gonna hit Hong Kong, you want anything?” His voice was normal. Like he wasn’t just torn apart by barbed wire.

“I…I don’t…I don’t under-“ The words barely escaped my throat. My tongue wouldn’t work right.

“So your usual? Sounds good, you can get me back whenever.” He said, walking past me after patting his firm comforting palm on my shoulder. His hand solid, real and firm. I heard him pick up his keys and rush out the door. Something in my head snapped fiercely as I walked over to Luke, and I gave in to the warmth of this place. He looked up at me,

“Hey, buddy.” He greeted with a tired almost whisper in his voice. Like he was made of glass and might shatter. The most extreme sense of calm, and purity overcame me. 

I sat down next to him and leaned my head back on the wall. I no longer had control of my actions, my spirit left my body, only a spectator now. Bliss washed over me as I felt the hospital, the bar, and this awful town become a distant memory.

“How’re you feeling?” I asked. He didn’t budge, and began to shake. We sat there for a few moments, just relishing in each other’s company. He let out a sigh.

“I’m sorry.” He said, the words full of sorrow. I could hear the guilt in his voice.

“Why? You’ve got nothing to be sorry for, man. We all go through shit. I’m here.” He didn’t respond. I wrapped my arm around him, offering him the same protective gesture as Ryan. “We’re gonna get you through this, I promise.” He still had no words for me, and stared at the ground. “Do you remember that first summer we spent here?” I asked him. He seemed to be walking through his thoughts.

“…best summer of my life.” He said wearily.

“Three TVs in the living room, each of us bought new consoles, and we played that old gory fighting game for about sixteen hours straight? Pizza rolls, cream soda, and what was it that Ryan was eating?”

“Veggie dogs with mac and cheese on them.” He answered with a laugh. I thought back to when Ryan tried to go vegetarian. It didn’t work out.

“Dude that’s right! Those were actually surprisingly good.” I began to chuckle with him, and felt genuine happiness for the first time in so long.

“Now look at us.” A sense of longing drifted in his voice. “You know, I never wanted any of this.” I focused my attention on him as he spoke. “I don’t know why I keep letting things get so fucked up.” He crossed his arms on top of his knees and buried his face in them and began to cry again. 

“We’re gonna get back to that, buddy. I promise. Just a little bump in the road.” Silence took us over again.  “I love you, Luke.” I told him.

“I love you too.” He replied.

I relished in that bliss for a long time. Time stretched long and thin like taffy. What felt like hours went by as I enjoyed this time with my friend. If there was a heaven, it had to feel like this. The warmth and safety of it all. It had felt like it had been forever since I’d seen him. Everything I’d been through in the past few hours had all but melted away. 

“I left you a key.” Luke said softly, breaking the silence. I turned my head at him in confusion.

“Wha?…” I said softly. The trance was slowly unraveling. My mind began to twist and bend as the smell of iron singed my nostrils. I heard metal creaking and the sound of steam shooting out of pipes. I looked over at Luke, but he was gone. The room had contorted into a nightmare of red and orange metal. The walls were lined with rotted chain link fence, and chains with hooks hung from the ceiling. It was still my room, but it had turned into something putrid.

A distorted voice pulled me out of it. 

“I’m gonna die.” I looked over and I could see Luke slowly warping. His eyes darkening, and small streams of brown liquid dripped out of his mouth. “I’m gonna die, cold and alone.” His bones started to crack as his arms twisted upwards.

In Luke’s place, something horrifying finally looked back at me. It grotesquely sat there chattering its sharp, gap filled teeth. Its arms were twisted together above its head, bound in sickening fashion with barbed wire twirled into its skin. Its mangled fingers jerked with sporadic and jerking motions. Dirt brown skin clung tightly to its chest, held together by a zipper tracing diagonally from its collar bone down to its waist on the opposite side. Its limbs appeared to be stitched on and one leg was sewn on backwards. It lacked eyelids, and stared back at me wildly with bloodshot dark red-brown eyes. 

“Why did you let me leave?” The stench of its breath hit me like a truck. Any air I had stored in my lungs left me. I stumbled frantically up to my feet, trying to catch my breath. As it tried to stand up, it looked down, a sick gargling forming in its throat. Before it could lift its head, it threw up an unfathomable amount of visceral black liquid onto the floor, then tiredly looked up at me, still clicking its teeth.

Before it could even think about coming towards me, I was at the door, twisting and pulling with all my strength. My wounds throbbed as my forearm flexed, but I pushed it out of mind as I frantically did everything I could to get out of that room.

“C’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon.” I looked over my shoulder, and could see the creature was about three feet closer to me, waddling and shaking its way over. “C’MON C’MON!” There was still no give in the door. “FUCK THIS!” I shouted as I started ramming my shoulder into the door. I felt helpless again, but kept at it. I could feel that things energy right behind me, and I couldn’t bring myself to face it. I kicked my leg out behind me and planted my foot into its stomach. As it fell back, it vomitted violently up into the air, a decent amount of it slopping onto my back and in my hair. The smell almost took my strength, but I shook myself back and threw my shoulder into the door one last time.

I could feel it about to dislocate by the time the door finally gave way. The creature yelled like a crazed man, its voice twisting with different inflections and octaves.

“PLEASE DOON’T LEAAAVE!” 

I fell through with an explosion of wooden splinters, and hit the ground hard. The shock of the landing sent a dull yet intense pain through my entire upper half. 

I threw my body around to face that thing again. But there was no red door and no monstrosity to fight. All that was left was a hospital room entranceway. 

“What?…” I looked around. Trying to find any trace of it. I heard footsteps racing around the corner. 

“Jay!? Are you alright!?” My head started to spin. 

“R…Ryan?” My lungs almost burned as I pushed the words out. I looked down at my arm. Clean. *What the fuck?* I thought. He held out his hand to me, and I accepted the help. I did my best to gather myself as I stood, but something came over me and I lunged at my friend, wrapping my arms around him tightly.

“Jay…you good man?”

“There’s something wrong with this place, Ryan.” I finally confessed. I’d been pushing it out of my mind, trying so desperately to focus on the task at hand. “Where’s Luke? Could he really be here?” He placed one hand on my back and gripped my jacket tightly, then gently pushed against my chest to get me to release him.

“Yeah, this place is a ghost town for sure.”

“No, Ryan. I mean seriously wrong. I’ve been seeing things ever since the bar.” He gave me a very confused look.

——

Ryan’s face grew whiter and whiter as I walked him through what I’d seen, and if it had been anyone but him, he wouldn’t have believed me. Guilt began to wash over me.

“I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m so sorry you got dragged into this, I should’ve come alone.” 

“Jay. I made the decision to come. It’s not on you, I promise. We’re gonna get through this. Sooner rather than later, I hope.”

I pulled the key from my jacket pocket.

“This has to mean something right? I mean he said he left it for us.” The question filled the air with urgency. Right as the words left my mouth, the fluorescent lights above us started to blink— not random electrical failure, but purposeful. *Click-click-click* down the corridor away from the exit. We froze, watching the darkness chase the light, or the light chase the darkness— I couldn’t tell which. We stood there a moment, letting it complete the sequence multiple times, before looking at each other, and then back down the hall. 

“We have to leave.” Ryan said insistently. “Now.” He pointed down the hall to the stairwell with an illuminated exit sign inviting us to escape. We jogged down the hall and as Ryan pushed into the bar, it wouldn’t budge. He pushed again, and again. 
“Fuck!” He screamed, giving the door a kick in anger. 

“What if it’s Luke? Trying to tell us where to go.” I said.

“Do you not hear how you sound?” But the lights began to flicker faster, insisting we listen to them. I gave him a sharp look.

“Goddamnit.” He sighed. “OKAY, let’s follow the crazy fucking lights.”

Entranced, we started to make our way down the hall, following the lights as they guided us through the wing. The temperature seemed to drop with every clink and hum of the fluorescent tubes above us. As we turned a corner, the corridor in front of us seemed impossibly long. But we obliged, passing a nurses station, and….another? And then another.

“That’s the same fucking cutout Jay! We’ve passed it three times!” As if bending the lights to his will, the bulb right above us blinked rapidly, screaming at us to get our attention. As we focused our eyes upwards, a light blinking in the stairwell just next to us began to blink, and we heard the lock unlatch with a hollow *CLUNK*. 

I pushed the door open, hesitantly, and the lights blinked in sequence down the stairs, descending into the inner bowels of the hospital.

“Fuck.” Ryan whispered. We followed the lights once again. Down. Further and further down. Pulling us into the lower basement levels of the building. The air grew thicker the further we descended. Chemical-sweet with disinfectant trying to mask something putrid underneath. The combination of the cold, and the scent of it all began to make me feel dizzy. 

A slight warmth in my jacket began to tug at my nerves. I dug around in my pocket for the key, and when I finally curled my fingers around it, it was warm, and getting hotter as we descended.

“Ryan, check this out.” I said, tossing him the key. As he caught it, he stared back at me with a bewildered look in his eyes.

“This is fucking insane.” But we didn’t stop walking down the stairs. The walls began to look more…decayed as we ventured further. This stairwell felt endless. Each flight down felt colder and smelled worse than the last.

We had to have been miles underground when the steps finally came to an end, and the key almost burned in my hand. The lights stopped flickering at a door marked MORGUE. The sign was old, the kind of lettering they don't use anymore. 

“Jay?” Ryan looked at me, concern spread across his pale features. “What the fuck is this?” I didn’t answer him, I couldn’t. A giant pit grew in my stomach. This couldn’t be real, it just couldn’t. It had to be another hallucination. Determined to prove myself right, I reached for the door, but before I could reach  it, it swung open furiously, letting out a soft pneumatic hiss, the room exhaling stale old air.

It was even colder in the morgue than in the stairwell. Rusted metal drawers lined the walls, incapable of reflecting any light back at us. The walls seeped orange and red liquid, trailing down and pooling on the floor.

I scanned each drawer, looking for any sort of reason why we’d been led down here. Each drawer had a slot for a card, and each was empty. Finally, my eyes focused on a drawer at the end of the room. A tag rested in its slot. I ran over to it, and our worst fears were suddenly realized. I could only legibly make out “LUKE” but the rest of his name was violently scratched out. Grief and guilt encompassed me, washing over my body like a waterfall. Ryan slowly made his way over to me. He let out a sound - half-laugh, half-sob. 

""No. No, we would have heard. Someone would have called—"" I reached out and wrapped my fingers around the handle. It was remarkably warm for how cold it was. “Don’t.” He said, but he was too late. I pulled open the drawer, and it let out loud violent squeaks as the tracks slid across the rollers. It was….empty…except for a piece of hospital stationary with Luke’s handwriting on it. 

*Come home. Please* I picked it up, revealing a Polaroid photo laying underneath it. 

“Here, hold this.” I said, handing Ryan the stationary. The photo felt warm, fresh, almost. It held three young skinny boys, their arms over each other’s shoulders, carrying big toothy smiles on their faces between its bold white frame. They couldn’t have been older than ten. My head began to spin…was this...us? Fuck it had to be us. I didn’t remember this, but it all started to come spilling back into my head as the faces in the picture grew more and more familiar. As I looked closer, I could make out a tall shadowy figure standing on the porch, but it was too distorted to make out any real features.

“Ryan, look!” I turned around violently and held the photo up. His face went pale as he examined it. “THATS US! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?”

“…Jay…the house…” The words softly flowed off his tongue, full of fear. Flipping the photo over, I looked closer. In big, black lettering across the siding read *1315* 

The temperature violently dropped, and the tone in the room shifted. Suddenly, one drawer in the opposite corner began to shake violently. The others all over the room quickly followed suit. Metal banging on metal pierced through my ear drums, almost causing them to ring. Then, one by one, starting with the drawer across the room, the drawers slid open in sequence, metal screeching against metal. The sound multiplied, echoing until it was almost deafening. I grabbed the photo and the note, shoving them in my pocket with the key, still burning hot.

""GO!"" Ryan shouted, already moving.

We took off in a dead sprint for the door. Behind us, the temperature dropped so fast that frost crawled across the metal drawers, crackling like fracturing bones. I could feel something moving in the darkness of those open compartments— not getting out, but watching us as we ran.

My lungs burned as we took the stairs two at a time. As we rounded the top of the first flight, I started to risk a glance back.

“Don’t look,” Ryan gasped, grabbing my arm. “Don’t fucking look back!” The stairwell felt endless. I could feel myself wheezing as we passed the same floor number. Then twice. Then yet again. I wanted to give up, for the pain in my legs to stop, but Ryan charging ahead of me kept my mind straight. 

Just when I thought I was going to pass out, or throw up, or more likely both, we burst through a door onto cold white tiles. I rolled onto my back, gasping for air and sweating through my clothes. Rolling back over, I did what I could to get my feet back under me, but my legs were heavy and numb. 

We were in the waiting room, just as we left it. Plain, white, and sanitary. Empty chairs and a vacant reception desk.

I held out my hand to Ryan, who was still lying on his back, trying to catch his breath. He extended his arm to me and held on as I pulled him to his feet.

Fresh air, if you could call it that, greeted my lungs as we stepped out of the entranceway. We were still gasping for air as we stumbled out into the parking lot. I placed my hands on my knees and bent over, trying not to dry heave.

“Is that…my fucking  car?” Ryan said, breathing deeply between each phrase. I looked up, and spotted Ryan’s blue shitbox. He pulled his keys from his pocket and hit the alarm. *HONKHONKHONK* He pressed the unlock button. *beepbeep* “What- the fuck.”

Ryan tossed me the keys. “You’re driving.” 

——

My hands shook as I grasped the handle and opened up the door. We sat in silence for a moment after I started the car. Letting the hum of the engine carry on for a while. Ryan reached over and pulled the photo out of my pocket. He studied it hard for a moment.

""I don't remember this house,"" he said quietly. ""I don't remember this photo being taken."" My knuckles were white on the steering wheel.

“Luke does.” I shifted the gear into drive, and sped out of the parking lot.

1o6kujy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1o6kujy/teaching_as_a_phd_first_class_humiliation/,Teaching as a PhD - first class humiliation,"Tl;dr today I just had my first time teaching a seminar, and to be honest I'm considering never teaching again.

I'll preface this by saying I'm a shy person, but not to the point of anxiety. I've had a history of self esteem issues that I've been to therapy for and a huge complex of inferiority (as, from what I can tell, many PhD students do).

To start, this was a seminar on Plato I'd done before as an undergrad, but knowing of hubris I prepped heavily for it. I got quotes from the text, watched all the lectures the students had, etc etc. The TA I was working with and guiding me (who was leading the seminar, having taught the module for years) gave me the slides, told me what I needed to do, gave me an incredibly small part of the seminar to deal with and even went first to show me how it's done.

Despite all of this, I was useless. Worse than useless, I was a detriment to our teaching as a pair. The first part of my ""contribution"" was looking at the board, then back at the students, covered in sweat, muttering out ""Who can tell me about Forms?"" God bless the students because they actually managed to interact, but my followups were below subpar, amounting to ""Yes that's what Plato said"" or ""That's a good point"" with no followup, accompanied with a pensive finger-over-the-mouth pose like I was trying to invoke The Thinker.

Soon, after failing at muttering something about the analogy of the ship (which as I learned through awkward pausing, was well beyond what most of the class had read), I ran out of steam, looking to the TA for a lifeline, which he thankfully gave me.

For the rest of the class, I stood stage right, trying to look as if I was going to jump in with a witty remark at some point or another, but of course I never did. I didn't stick around, as soon as class was dismissed I grabbed my bag from behind the lectern, gave my saviour a thumbs up, and ran out the class and up the stairs to the next floor to avoid any students being reminded of the last hour of public humiliation they had to witness.

I'll be honest, the trip home once I came out of hiding was a dark one, thoughts I hadn't had in years came bubbling to the surface, the tamest of them being that I wasn't cut out for teaching, should immediately resign my teaching post, or even leave my PhD all together to save myself from further embarrassment.

What's the solution? Do I need a cocktail of anti-anxiety medicines for my next session, as coffee wasn't cutting it? Do I, as I've suggested, give up on my dream since I was a child to teach? Words of support and similar stories of total shitshows of teaching are greatly, greatly appreciated.",22,1760460603.0,PhD,20,0.83,False

I spent my birthday working, my health has, at one point, dropped tremendously (I think I caught the 'popular' flu). I lost a treasured companion. 

But still, despite everything, what needs to be done has been done. And sometimes, that in itself is worth celebrating. 

This Wednesday, October 16, I will be attending multiple meetings in Quezon City. After it, I'm planning to visit a hidden, speakeasy bar somewhere in Teacher's village. Or maybe read until midnight on some random late-closing coffee shop. This is my type of quiet celebration. 

Ikaw, mayroon ka rin bang gusto i-celebrate? Tara. Bigyan natin ng soft but well-deserved pat on the back ang ating mga sarili. For thriving. Or for just even surviving.

- Works in the development sector (not the DPWH one, but the ""serve the people"" one)
- Taking post-grad.
- Hindi ko gets yung pag-lalagay ng height at personal descriptors sa post, pero sige, 5'7 ako. I can also send a picture kung kailangan (for safety purposes or otherwise)

- 23-33 (not ageist, pero para lang mas higher chances na same wavelength)
- Tao sana, pero kung isa sa mga creatures sa Trese, sige pwede na.
- Respectable Karma, pass sa less than 100. Sana rin kita yung ilang activities mo sa feed para alam kong real ka talaga (and not just a figment of my imagination)
- May pera. Hindi kita libre. Pero pwede rin. Depende. Dala ka pera para sure. 
- Willing to exchange pictures before meeting. Baka mamaya magkamali ako ng kalabit ng tao, ma-gripuhan pa ako ng wala sa oras.
- Have something to celebrate. Small or big wins, or just surviving. Para naman hindi lang ako ang bida sa Cinemalaya film na ito.

I’d brought all this up to the clinical lead, several times. Coworker would stick to it for about a week then revert. Turns out Medicare stopped paying on a lot of the patients she roomed. She wasn’t going over the required questions. (ADL, fall risk, home safety, etc…)  

I took a position in the corporate office but was still keeping her referrals updated and doing med refills because I really liked the provider. Documented all that and sent that to the clinical lead. Got a snarky ass response, “well, aren’t we lucky to have you looking out for us.”  So I stopped.  Before long there were a months worth of med refills not touched and multiple urgent referrals for things like positive Cologuards not sent. 

Finally it was enough of an issue she was on probation. Come back after the weekend and she reverted to old habits.  Finally let go.

1o6kr54,https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalysistips/comments/1o6kr54/what_are_you_doing_to_get_promoted/,What Are You Doing to Get Promoted?,"

Career growth for business analysts doesn’t happen by accident; it’s a result of consistently demonstrating leadership, strategic thinking, and the ability to create real business value. If you’re ready to move up the ladder, here are ten proven strategies to help you earn that next promotion.

# 1. Go Beyond the Basics

Strong foundational skills, such as requirements elicitation and stakeholder management, are just the start. To stand out, show that you understand how your work drives business results and strategic outcomes. Instead of just documenting system changes, link each requirement to a business goal—such as reducing processing time by 20% and present that impact during review meetings.

# 2. Take on High-Visibility Projects

Projects that involve multiple departments or have executive attention are opportunities to showcase your leadership potential. They also put you in front of decision-makers who can influence your career.  
Volunteer to be the lead business analyst for a cross-functional digital transformation initiative and communicate progress updates to senior leadership.

# 3. Build Your Communication and Influence Muscles

Great business analysts don’t just gather information; they guide conversations and influence outcomes. Improving how you communicate with technical and business teams makes you invaluable. When stakeholders disagree on priorities, facilitate a discussion to identify shared goals and propose a balanced solution that keeps the project on track.

# 4. Develop Broad Business Knowledge

Understanding how different parts of the organization connect positions you as a strategic partner. The more you know about how the business operates, the better you can recommend solutions that deliver value. Spend a week shadowing colleagues in operations or finance to understand their processes and identify improvement opportunities that align with company goals.

# 5. Invest in Professional Development

Certifications and continuous learning demonstrate commitment and keep your skills relevant. Whether through formal credentials or practical courses, growth-minded analysts are noticed and rewarded. Earn your CBAP or Agile certification and present a short “lunch and learn” session for your team on how the new techniques can improve project outcomes.

# 6. Lead Without a Title

Leadership isn’t defined by hierarchy; it’s demonstrated through initiative, accountability, and mentorship. Start acting like a leader before you’re given the title. Offer to mentor a new BA on your team or facilitate requirements workshops that help the team reach clarity faster.

# 7. Show Measurable Impact

Executives value results they can see and quantify. Always communicate the outcomes of your work in business terms, not just deliverables. Track the time saved or cost reduced after implementing one of your recommendations and share those metrics during performance reviews or project retrospectives.

# 8. Align with Organizational Strategy

When your work supports company priorities, leadership takes notice. Make it your mission to understand your organization’s strategic goals and connect your projects to those outcomes. If your company is focusing on customer experience, frame your requirements around improving user satisfaction or reducing customer support tickets.

# 9. Find Mentors and Sponsors

A mentor helps you grow; a sponsor opens doors. Build relationships with senior professionals who can provide guidance and advocate for your advancement. Reach out to a senior manager you respect and ask for a 30-minute coffee chat to learn how they navigated their own career path.

# 10. Think Like a Business Leader

As you progress, shift from a tactical to a strategic mindset. Start asking “What outcome are we driving?” instead of “What feature are we building?” In project discussions, propose options based on cost-benefit analysis or customer impact—showing that you’re thinking beyond requirements and into business results.

1o6kqk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1o6kqk8/could_i_forgive_my_mother/,Could I forgive my mother ?,"2025 has been an incredible year for me. I bought my first house with my fiancé, passed my driving test, and graduated from university in just two days! I’m incredibly proud of myself and excited for what the future holds. However, I’ve been thinking about how unwilling my mother is to celebrate these milestones with me, and it’s deeply hurtful.

Six months ago, my mum, who is 40, got into a relationship with her best friend’s son, who is 33. She’s never had someone who treats her well, and for that reason, I’m protective of her. Unfortunately, he showed the most red flags a man could possibly have.

• He’s a heavy drinker, and my mum is an undiagnosed alcoholic who had just spent months stopping drinking. It had taken her years to get to this point, and within a week of him being on the scene, they were drinking all day until early hours in the morning.

• He has no respect for people’s homes. When I lived with my mum, he would treat her house like a dump. He would bed-roll until late afternoon and then smoke upstairs at night, making it difficult to breathe. He also burnt holes in a brand-new mattress and an expensive dressing gown that belonged to my mum. He tossed his cigarette ends wherever he pleased, including in the dog bed, a candle, and on the sides and floor.

When I moved out four months ago, I welcomed them to see my first house on the hottest day of the year. All of my doors and windows were open, and my mum’s boyfriend went straight out the back door and lit a cigarette right next to my property. I politely asked him to move away, which caused a massive argument between me and my mum because I made him feel uncomfortable.

• He doesn’t have a job. I didn’t expect him to get one straight away when he moved from Manchester. He started applying, but he wouldn’t show up for interviews because he’d sleep until late afternoon. In my opinion, he has no interest in working. It wasn’t long after that I overheard a conversation about her transferring him money for concert tickets, and she made it sound like he had surprised her with them. More and more, I’m noticing that she’s telling people he’s brought her this and that, but I don’t understand where he’s pulling all this money out of.

• He argues with my 11-year-old brother, messaged my grandparents abuse, messaged my brother’s dad abuse, and even shouted abuse down the phone at me because I defended my family. I’m convinced he doesn’t do it for drama; there’s nothing else to do in his sad life.



From him coming into my mother’s life, mine and her relationship has deteriorated. After pointing out all his behaviour and her making excuses for him, we’ve lost our connection. I accepted that he’d be a part of her life, but I made it clear I didn’t want him in mine. Since then, every achievement I’ve had has been done alone, and she hasn’t wanted to be a part of it. She’d change the topic if I spoke about moving out, and when it happened, she didn’t help. I always thought we’d do our weekly shopping together, go for coffee, and have mother-daughter days, but I can count how many times she’s visited me since I moved out on one hand. When I passed my driving test the first time, her response was why wasn’t I tagged on Facebook. Now, my graduation is in two days, and I picked my nan and fiancé to watch the ceremony because they held me up when my mother was pulling me under. There have been too many arguments between us because of this man-child, and I’m not sure I could possibly forgive her for the pain she’s put me through at a time in my life that should have been full of joy.

1o6kpz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1o6kpz8/find_out_if_the_best_wood_polish_picreator/,Find Out if the Best Wood Polish Picreator Delivers on Shine,"Testing the Picreator 65mL can Renaissance Micro-Crystalline Wax Polish has been an enlightening experience, and I can confidently share my thoughts on how it performs in practical scenarios. This specialized wax polish, known for its versatility, immediately caught my attention with promises of restoring and protecting surfaces like wood, metal, leather, and even paper. With its long-standing history of being developed by the British Museum, the expectations were naturally high, and I put it through a range of tests to see how it fares.

**Ease of Application**  
In my first use, I found the application process incredibly straightforward. The wax has a smooth texture that spreads easily with a soft cloth. I used it on an antique wooden table passed down from my grandmother, and the product did an excellent job restoring the luster. A little goes a long way, and the polish dried almost instantly, which was a big plus when working on multiple pieces. The formula doesn’t leave a greasy residue, and the surface feels clean yet protected after buffing.

**Good Points**  
- Exceptionally versatile: works on wood, metal, leather, and more.  
- Quick-drying and non-greasy, making cleanup a breeze.  
- Provides a soft sheen that enhances natural colors.  

[Check Picreator 65mL can Renaissance Micro-Crystalline Wax Polish price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b001dszwem/)

**Protection and Durability**  
One of the major selling points is its ability to protect surfaces against spills and fingerprints. After the first application, I put this claim to the test. A splash of coffee on that same restored table wiped off without leaving any marks—no small feat for furniture polish. It’s great in a household setting where things occasionally (or frequently) don’t go as planned. The protective layer it creates is subtle but effective, even giving new life to a pair of worn leather shoes I experimented on.  

**Positives**  
- Resistant to liquid spills and smudges.  
- Adds longevity to surfaces by creating a thin, resilient coat.  
- Brings out vibrant colors without altering the original finish.  

**Convenience and Size**  
The 65mL can may look small, but it is surprisingly efficient. After polishing several items, including a wooden chessboard, metal figurines, and a leather-bound book, the wax hardly seemed depleted. Its compact size also makes it easy to store, and I could see how this could be a game-changer for people who need a reliable polishing solution without the bulk. However, if you’re looking to polish larger surfaces frequently, you might need to restock sooner than you think.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Small size may not be ideal for larger projects.  
- Packaging design could feel more modern and user-friendly.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing this product with other polishes I’ve tried in the past, it stands out for its versatility and museum-grade quality. For example, general all-purpose cleaners don’t come close to achieving the same level of surface-specific results. However, larger brands like Howard and Minwax offer furniture polish that’s more cost-effective for solely wood-focused projects. Where the Renaissance Wax truly shines is its multi-surface use. Unlike competitors, it can be safely applied to items like fine artwork, which other polishes might damage over time. It’s also less aggressive than some harsher formulas, making it a gentler choice for valuable antiques and collectibles.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Looking at the price-performance ratio, it might initially seem like a premium investment for a small size. But this is a case where quality transcends quantity. The wax excels in providing a consistent, professional-grade finish and trustworthy protection across materials. For anyone who values preserving precious items or just wants a reliable solution for regular household polishing tasks, this can feels worth every penny. While it may not suit someone hunting for bulk applications, the precision and results it delivers are hard to argue with.

And things in our relationship have been going down hill for over half of that. She’s not seeming happy anymore, or for at least the most part. And it’s making me feel sad too. I’m finding that it’s making me more sad and stressed than anything else in my life currently, and my mates have said I seem sad around her.

Our intimate life is barely a thing, and has been for 8 months ish. She gets really angry with me for “wanting to do stuff all the time” but we only seen each other once a week due to college and her parents. I feel like she anting to do stuff when we see each other is fine but I’m starting to doubt myself. She  also went through a phase of saying that she’s only doing stuff for me, which freaked me out loads and made it so that I didn’t wanna do anything for a while. When starting stuff I’m always the one to initiate, and it’s making me feel unwanted. She has also started saying recently after things that she wanted me to do the work as she dint have the energy to do anything, which has been making me feel horrible about doing things.

I’ve been thinking recently about ending the relationship because of the way it’s making me feel. But I feel really guilty about it because of some of the things she’s saying. She’s said that “I’m her only source of happiness” and the I’m “her only friend” and it’s making me feel a little trapped in my own head because I’m scared of what she’ll do and think if we break up. She’s also been asking for a lot of reassurance about us recently and it’s killing me saying that we are okay. I still love her, but i don’t feel happy anymore and it’s a huge deal for me as I’ve had massive mental health problems in the past.

About six months later I had my first manic episode with psychosis during the summer of 2018. I was 20 years old at the time. Now I am 27 and seven years have passed. I was hospitalized in a university clinic where I was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder.



I remember very clearly how it all started. At first, you do not need sleep. You feel rested even without closing your eyes. You have energy, ideas and confidence. You become more aggressive, more protective of your space and you feel like you can do anything. It is like a wave of euphoria takes over you and makes you feel unstoppable. At first it feels amazing. But later, when your batteries run out and your brain stops producing dopamine and serotonin at those levels, you crash. You are left with almost nothing. It is like a very strong coffee. It lifts you up at first, but later you pay for it twice as hard.



I started medication back then, Tavor and Zylanza (a cheaper alternative to Zyprexa). Since then I have seen seven psychiatrists and tried almost every treatment available for bipolar disorder. None of them really worked for me because of the side effects, so I stopped everything.



Now I do not take any medication and I try to manage it on my own. It is not easy at all. It is a battle every day, but I try to keep my balance and notice when my mood starts to shift before it goes too far.

1o6kd0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/1o6kd0o/grownups_of_reddit_in_what_ways_have_you/,"Grown-ups of Reddit, in what ways have you seriously rehabilitated your character for the better?","Apologies for the arguably wordy way of phrasing the title question, but I wanted to hear some perspective, wisdom, etc., on ways in which you've seriously changed yourself *apart from* the obvious or more commonly touted sorts of reform (working out more often, beating addiction, etc.). We often pigeonhole ourselves and our character; we say things like, ""oh, I'm a math guy; I've never really exceled in writing,"" or, ""oh, I'm a night owl, so I'm next to useless in the morning."" While sometimes these self descriptions are rooted in truths, I also feel that, at least in my case, such self descriptions are buffers or ego defenses; I know that change is needed, but I frame the matter as an issue of immutable character rather than changeable habits. I'm asking the topic question as a thirty-seven-year-old male who is currently working through two kinds of ""personal rehabilitation"" and may soon embark upon a third. I'll describe them, and then I'd really love to hear from all of you, whether it's sharing your own or remarking on what I've included here. Any guidance you can offer is also super appreciated.

1. **""I'm a night owl""**: It's true that we don't all adhere to the same sleep schedule. I have friends my age that have little trouble being up and out of bed before 6:00 a.m., even in cases in which they aren't required, for work or otherwise, to be out of bed so early. I myself have often joked that, if I were made Emperor for Life, no one could reasonably expect you to be out of bed while the clock still said ""a.m."" However, after struggling in my professional and personal life with depression and fatigue, I've made an effort to try and maintain a proper sleep hygiene. It's still early in the process, and I'm not always successful, but damn it if I'm not *already* noticing how much better life feels when I've not squandered most of the morning in bed. Go figure, Ben Franklin was onto something when he talked about how to be healthy, wealthy, and wise, right?
2. **""I'm a homebody""**: I've been divorced for the last year or so. One of the major disconnects between my ex and me was that, while she loved to go out and live the night life, I enjoyed the quietness of home. Again, like being an early riser versus being a night owl, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with preferring a loud or social night life versus enjoying quiet time at home. Rather, I feel that, in the past, I used ""being a homebody"" as an excuse to idle at home, not make or maintain connections with others, and generally not develop any new interests. Now that I'm no longer married or cohabitating with anyone, it's pretty much up to me whether or not I get out, and after struggling for a while, I've begun making myself go out more days than not. Sometimes for exercise, sometimes to sit in a coffee shop or bookstore, etc., but whatever the reason, I feel better for having gotten out.
3. **""I'm a gamer""** (work in progress): Okay, I don't know that I've ever unironically said, ""I'm a gamer,"" but I wanted to adhere to the format I had for (1) and (2). I've played video games all my life. My literal first memory is playing *Super Mario Bros.* on my dad's NES. Video games were a form of escape and entertainment for me throughout childhood and, in particular, during a very tumultuous and occasionally abusive adolescence. My relationship with video games has always, I felt, bordered on addiction without quite reaching addiction. Call it ""high-functioning,"" perhaps; I played a lot of video games, but I always found time to get work and school done, even if it was sometimes a crunch or rushed job. But as someone who is working on self improvement, I can't help but wonder how much time would be freed up for other hobbies and pursuits if I didn't allow myself to lose so many hours to gaming. Whether mindlessly playing *Slay the Spire* or *Balatro* on my phone to committing serious time to games like *Age of Empires II* or *Civilization V*, gaming is a nontrivial time sink, and I feel like I would have more focus and be more well rounded as a person if I stopped pursuing the short-term dopamine hits of playing video games.

Apologies if this post is especially long-winded. I appreciate in advance you reading this post, and, again, I'd really love to hear your input and experiences.
