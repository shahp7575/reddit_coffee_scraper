**By** [**Micky Irons**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickyirons/)**, Founder of** [**Unified**](https://unified.vip/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickyirons/) · [X](https://x.com/Micky_Ironss) · [Google](https://share.google/oAQevr9Qo8nVkgN5u)

*Unified is committing 10% of gross revenue — not profit — to the Unified Humanitarian Fund. Here’s why I made that decision before writing a single line of code, and how quadratic voting puts the power in the community’s hands.*

Most tech companies treat philanthropy like a PR exercise. A splashy donation here, a hashtag campaign there, a corporate social responsibility page buried three clicks deep on their website. It looks good in an annual report. It changes very little on the ground.

When I founded [Unified](https://unified.vip/), I made a decision before writing a single line of code: giving would not be an afterthought. It would be baked into the architecture of the business as a non-negotiable system expense. Ten percent of our gross revenue will flow directly into the Unified Humanitarian Fund (UHF). Not ten percent of profit, which companies can creatively minimise. Ten percent of *revenue*. Every pound that comes through the door, a tenth of it goes straight to the people and places that need it most.

This isn’t charity. It’s infrastructure.

There’s a quote from [Jeff Hoffman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffhoff/) — entrepreneur, NASA advisor, and Founder & President of [World Youth Horizons](https://www.worldyouthhorizons.com/) — that has stayed with me since the earliest days of building Unified: *“Your success is someone else’s miracle.”* That idea shaped everything about how I approached the UHF. If we’re building a platform that touches every part of someone’s daily life — their travel, their finances, their health — then the success of that platform should ripple outward. Not as an afterthought, not as a tax write-off, but as a fundamental feature of how the system works.

# What Is the Unified Humanitarian Fund (UHF)?

The Unified Humanitarian Fund is a humanitarian engine built into the core of the [Unified platform](https://unified.vip/). Unlike traditional corporate giving programmes that fluctuate with shareholder sentiment, the UHF is designed as a fixed operating expense — as permanent as server costs and salaries. It will activate the moment Unified begins generating revenue, with quarterly distributions governed entirely by the community.

The fund operates across four focus areas, each addressing a critical global need:

**Emergency & Disaster Response** receives 40% of the fund. When earthquakes strike, when floods displace communities, when conflict zones need medical supplies — this is the money that moves first. This is also the only category where funding can be released outside the quarterly cycle, because catastrophic events don’t wait for a voting round.

**Educational Access** receives 35%. This will fund programmes that connect underserved communities to learning — from building physical schools to deploying internet infrastructure in rural regions. The types of projects we’ll be funding include connecting schools to the internet, providing hardware and teacher training, and establishing STEM scholarship programmes.

**Healthcare & Wellness** receives 15%, targeting initiatives like teletherapy platforms for underserved regions and community health programmes in areas where access to medical professionals is scarce.

**Environmental Sustainability** receives the remaining 10%, targeting projects like large-scale reforestation with satellite monitoring and carbon offset initiatives.

# Why Micky Irons Chose Revenue Over Profit

This distinction matters enormously, and it’s one I feel strongly about as a founder.

Companies that pledge a percentage of profit retain enormous discretion over how much actually reaches the fund. Accounting decisions, reinvestment strategies, and creative expense allocation can reduce “profit” to a fraction of what a company actually earns. Revenue is honest. It’s the top line. It doesn’t bend to creative accounting.

Across all of [Unified’s](https://unified.vip/) various revenue streams, 10% of what the platform generates will be earmarked for the UHF. There will be no board vote. There will be no quarterly review to decide whether this year’s humanitarian contribution is “feasible.” It’s baked into the operating model — a structural commitment, not a discretionary one.

For users, this means that every interaction with Unified will have a humanitarian dimension. Your daily coffee run will contribute to disaster relief. Your holiday booking will help fund a school. The platform will track this for every user — showing your personal contribution, the projects your activity has helped fund, and the tangible impact those projects deliver.

# How Quadratic Voting Changes Humanitarian Governance

Here’s where Unified’s approach becomes genuinely different from anything else in the tech industry. The UHF won’t operate like a traditional corporate foundation where a small committee decides where the money goes. Instead, we’re using a governance mechanism called quadratic voting to let our community direct the funds.

Every quarter, verified nonprofits submit project proposals to the fund. The community reviews them during a two-week due diligence period, and then $UNI token holders cast their votes. But this isn’t a simple “one token, one vote” system — and that’s by design.

In quadratic voting, the cost of each additional vote on a single project increases exponentially. One vote costs one token. Two votes cost four. Five votes cost twenty-five. Ten votes cost one hundred. The formula is simple: the cost equals the square of the number of votes.

Why does this matter? Because it prevents wealthy participants from dominating outcomes. Someone with 100 tokens can either place 10 votes on a single project or spread 5 votes across four different projects for the same cost. The system naturally incentivises broad, diverse participation rather than concentrated influence. It amplifies passionate voices while ensuring that collective preference — not individual wealth — determines where the money flows.

This is a governance model with serious academic backing, originally proposed by economist Glen Weyl, and it solves one of the oldest problems in democratic decision-making: how to balance intensity of preference with equality of voice.

# Blockchain-Verified Transparency: Trust Through Visibility

Every UHF transaction will be blockchain-verified. Every funded project will report against defined milestones. The entire fund will be independently audited annually by PwC. Users will be able to view a real-time Impact Dashboard on the [Unified platform](https://unified.vip/) showing exactly where the money has gone, complete with photo and video documentation from funded projects, beneficiary testimonials, and progress tracking against deliverables.

I built this level of transparency into [Unified](https://unified.vip/) because the humanitarian sector has a trust problem — and the solution isn’t asking people to trust harder. It’s making trust unnecessary by making everything visible.

The UHF will begin distributing funds quarterly once Unified starts generating revenue. Each quarter, the community will vote on which projects receive funding, and every transaction will be trackable in real time. In the event of a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, emergency funding can be released immediately — outside the standard quarterly cycle — because some situations simply cannot wait.

# The Business Case for Built-In Social Impact

Let’s be direct: the UHF isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s a competitive advantage.

Consumer research consistently shows that people — particularly younger demographics — prefer to spend with companies that demonstrate genuine social impact. But “genuine” is the operative word. Consumers have become sophisticated at spotting performative giving. A percentage-of-profit pledge with no transparency mechanism and no community governance is, increasingly, not enough.

The UHF will give [Unified](https://unified.vip/) users something tangible: a personal impact dashboard that shows exactly how their platform activity translates into humanitarian outcomes. It will transform passive consumers into active participants in global development. And because the quadratic voting system gives users real decision-making power over where the money goes, it creates a depth of engagement that traditional loyalty programmes simply cannot match.

People won’t just use Unified. They’ll shape where its humanitarian resources are deployed. That’s a fundamentally different relationship between a company and its users.

# What Unified’s Digital Operating System Means for the Future of Tech and Philanthropy

We’re building [Unified](https://unified.vip/) as a Digital Operating System — a platform that unifies travel, finance, and health management into a single, intelligent experience. The UHF sits at the heart of that vision because I believe technology platforms have an obligation to do more than optimise for shareholder returns.

The 10% commitment is permanent. It scales with our growth. As Unified’s user base expands and revenue increases, so does the fund — which means every new user doesn’t just benefit from the platform, they amplify its humanitarian impact.

We’re not asking our users to donate. We’re not running a charity campaign with an end date. We’re building a company where impact is a structural feature, not a marketing story.

Every transaction on Unified tells two stories: the one about what you did for yourself, and the one about what you did for someone else. That’s how technology should work.

How :-
So we used to sit at the same place always where she sat just in front of me. I daily crossed her while going to my seat. But never talked nor did I tried to initiate ever.( I was recovering from a bad breakup and made a mindset ki ab hogyi thik thak bakchodi jivan mai , ab for once let's just focus on my life , sports and career)

But as the cource was near it's end , she asked me for coffee during a break and asked for some notes (through WhatsApp), TO which also I restrained from exchanging numbers and said I will physically give them Tommorow and she can get it printed.

But then suddenly post cource ( we were both in same city ) completion after a month or so , she texted me ( probably taking my number from one of our groups) about she needed a help with some boy who's behind her for many days , i aubviously helped her with that scene , got the things sorted , then she texted she owes me a coffee to which I resisted few days , but once she just calls and she is around place where I live , so I went and met her. And bass this became quite regular, with she wanting to go for lunch in weekends and so and so

Now:-

With few months passing together and talking regularly, that fuckin attachment side of mine kicked in 🫠. Now she had birthday in few days , so I thought that now that she's been with me in my highs and lows (for talking out my frustrations) , so she deserves a good treat

So I booked a good venue , made arrangements for her birthday and bought a gift . But now suddenly that day ma'am can't leave her home to meet me coz she had plans and i didn't inform about the SURPRISE to her already in advance.

Thik hai bhai , I thought koi na . Thoda bura lagna to banta tha na ab , to i didn't texted her for few days now, neither did she. Then I just texted her asking for a coffee and I'll give her gift (which she almost forgot). So she came after a long week and picked her gift and then started un necessary formalities, yaar please don't do all these for me , I don't think I am on that level with u yet bla bla bla... bullshit 

Are madam maine to just as a good gesture kiya tha , maine konsa ghutno pe baithke propose kardiya aapko , but thik hai , I tried to explain once a couldn't I left . And we didn't talked for almost 5-6 months

Now 

Ma'am ko once again meri yaad si aagyi hai

Unhe mere life mai kya chalra hai jaan na hai , meri family ki chinta hai , mere pet ki yaad aari hai 😂, meri advices chaiye bla bla

I give really cold replies , I don't want to continue the chats , just laugh and end 

Now again there's silence and I feel kinda regret i didn't entertained her , maybe she needed me this that bla bla , but there's a side of me that says , she's just bored again, wants attention again and all I know about me is , mai baar baar ye phase se nahi nikal paunga

Kya lagta hai aapko , chahti kya hai ye naari ?

I order the same thing almost every time: iced latte, oat milk, one pump vanilla, and please no whipped cream. Pretty normal. The problem is they mess it up a lot. Like not “oops wrong lid” level, I mean full dairy milk (I can taste it instantly), or it comes hot, or it’s missing the vanilla, or they put whipped cream on it even though I always say no. I’m not allergic-allergic but dairy makes my stomach feel like it’s starting a war, so I either toss it or give it away and then I’m out money and still caffeine-less.

At first I didn’t say much. I’d be like “hey sorry, I think this is regular milk?” and they’d remake it, no big deal. But it kept happening, and what started to get to me was the attitude. Last week they handed me a drink with whipped cream, I said “sorry, I asked for no whip,” and the barista sighed like I was asking them to carve the cup by hand. Then yesterday it happened again, this time it was clearly regular milk. I took one sip and was like nope. I went back up and said, pretty calm, “Hey I come here a lot, and my order keeps getting made with regular milk. Can you please remake it with oat milk? I’m not trying to be a pain, but it happens kinda often.” 

The barista kinda rolled their eyes and said “We’re busy, mistakes happen.” Which yeah sure, but also it’s a 6 dollar drink?? Then the manager (or shift lead, idk) came over and did that smile that’s not a real smile and said “What seems to be the issue?” I explained again, and I swear I was not yelling, just annoyed. The manager was like “Our staff is doing their best, if you’re that picky maybe you should order something simpler.” That hit a nerve, because I’m not being picky, I’m asking for the milk I paid for. I said “It’s not picky to want the right ingredients. If you can’t make it, just tell me so I’ll go somewhere else.” 

After that the manager got all stiff and was like “We can refund you this time,” like I was some scammer trying to get free coffee. People in line were staring, and one dude did the whole “come on man” face. I took the refund because at that point I didn’t even want the drink anymore. Walking out I felt like… did I just become That Customer? But also, how many times are you supposed to politely eat the cost of their mistakes?

TL;DR: A coffee shop keeps making my drink wrong (regular milk instead of oat etc). I finally told them it happens a lot and asked for a remake, manager implied I’m too picky. I got a refund and left. AITJ?

We had already broken up in August, she started training in September, he begged for me to stay in October when I got back from an extended trip. I asked him to lay it all on the table. What he wanted and all that. He wanted kids, marriage etc. He said that he realized all these things while I was gone. So he went and asked my parent for my hand in marriage. Boom, month later the ""lines were blurry"" with this girl he was training. She asked for his number before Thanksgiving and basically said she wanted to get to know him outside of work and that she was going to miss him when she left for another state where she is assigned. They went to coffee dates while I was at work and kissed (but who knows). But also believable because they are both awkward nerdy engineers. 

Anyway, when I found out in December I moved out literally the week after. He was still reaching out. Breadcrumbs. I was obviously still responding. I went out to dinner with him on his birthday in January, had him blow a candle and all. We were intimate like 3 times probably and by the third time I just knew I couldn't do it without emotional attachment. He flat out just lied about pursuing her. He also doesn't have anyone to talk to so I think he doesn't see that it's inappropriate to text me about things about her. He says he wants me to feel vindicated, that I ""won."" Because it didn't work out with her anyway. 

Well, I have been having dreams of him and just a heavy feeling overall. Thinking of him more. And I've always had some weird tie or psychic things in relation to him. Like dreaming of him cheating and it happening. Or just dreaming of things in general in my life that occur in real life. The other day I dreamt of him basically having sex with someone in front of me and being nonchalant about it. I \*stupidly\* asked him if he believed in entanglements and if I was right. And he said yes but not that they were having sex (yet) but that I guess he is pursuing her still. And he was pursuing her the whole time after we broke up, even when he still kept trying to spend time with me. I again, as a glutton for punishment I guess, asked if she was really worth it and he replied ""it's complicated, but I think so.""

I don't know if I'm dissociated at this point or what but I feel like I can't cry when I should be. I do feel nauseous or shaky inside. I want whatever this ""soul tie"" to be done. 

WHY DO I DO THIS?!?! How do I sever the ties? How did you guys move on? It makes me feel like shit that he truly said he actually wanted to move forward with marriage and kids but got cold feet and now he's just moving on with this other girl who he within the last week called ""sour.""

I've talked to my doctors about it and they say I'm too young to be having chronic pain. I've tried better diet, exercise, mindfulness exercises, the whole thing. So I don't really think I'm soliciting for medical advice here, because I'm already doing what I need to be doing to help myself. And it's not helping enough, which is exactly why this leaves me here interested in knowing more about alternative treatments and supplements.*

I am way too young to be having issues waking up in the morning due to chronic pain. My morning routine is wake up, take my meds and ibuprofen, and then go back to sleep for an hour or two before getting up. Which, I don't even know why I do this because it hardly helps at all. I'm still completely stiff until I get my first morning of coffee. Which is what got me thinking, coffee has anti-inflammatories in it, and maybe it's my cup of coffee in the morning that's seemingly helping me with my pain and getting up.

So then YouTube starts fervently recommending these videos about spirulina. Which, I had never heard of the stuff before. Supposedly though it's a superfood and the most nutrient dense substance on the planet. Who knew. But supposedly apparently it also has a kind of cyanobacteria which has anti-inflammatory effects. And that is exactly what I'm curious about.

I'm just keen on hearing if anyone else has experience with the stuff. When it comes to chronic pain treatments it really can be a hit or miss of what works.

Higher management informed employees that they would not be allowed to go home tonight because stock reconciliation needed to be done. It wasn’t presented as a request or voluntary overtime — it sounded like an order.

From what I understood, there was no clear discussion about overtime pay or willingness of employees. One employee mentioned that it was Ramzan and he needed to go for Namaz. Management told him he could go pray and then return to continue work.

I don’t know the full internal policies of the company, but it raised questions for me about work-life balance, overtime consent, and employee rights.

Is this a common practice in retail? What are the legal or ethical expectations in such situations in India?",1,1771424962.0,hyderabad,0,1.0,False
1r84gga,https://i.redd.it/qt142h9uj9kg1.jpeg,Remember the “little people”,"I am currently a staff member at an R1 university (program manager for a research center in my field). I work closely with graduate students as an internal advocate, grant distributor, supervisor, fundraiser, event planner, etc. I have field and institutional connections up the wazoo. I have found upwards of $20k for students in need of funding. I have created job positions for graduate students in my department. I have (under the table) written grants with faculty friends to pay our grad students stipends for supporting a large event our center organizes. I have created events to put grad students on panels with their academic role models, some of whom travel across the world to speak. Most importantly, I always have a lot of food in my office and intentionally buy more catering than needed for events so I can give away the leftovers to my starving grad students on the university’s dime. 

Higher Ed notoriously undervalues, underpays, and overworks its staff members. Faculty can be cruel, students (esp PhD students… just saying) can be entitled and demanding. It is my job to support all students who request support, but I go out of my way for the ones who I know well because I am aware of their research. It is far easier to advocate for people you know and respect. For example, if I know you’re in education and need funding for a research trip, it takes one coffee with my program manager friend in that department and a couple strategically worded emails to figure something out. 

As I start a new journey as a grad student myself, it will be easy to get swept away in the excitement and overwhelm of a first year PhD student. However, I will not forget my time as a staff member, and I will be sure to make good relationships with all the staff I encounter. I advise that everyone starting their own program does so as well. Beyond being just a normal and kind person, treating staff well will holistically support your graduate journey. Staff are part of my academic community too and I will certainly treat them as such. Be kind, humble, curious. Take opportunities they give you! Staff don’t have much power in the hierarchical sense, but we have networks; we always know someone who knows someone. Take that as you will.

1r84gc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1r84gc3/psa_from_a_muslim_its_ramadan_and_no_you_dont/,"PSA from a Muslim: It’s Ramadan, and no, you don’t need to hide your lunch from us. Here are 10 tips for non-Muslims!","Hey everyone! Ramadan starts from today (from this sunset), and I’ve already seen a few questions. For those who don’t know, Ramadan is the month where Muslims fast from dawn until sunset (no food, no water, no smoking, no sex, no bad words).

It can seem confusing or intimidating from the outside, but I promise we’re not a walking collection of hunger strikes. So, here are ten tips to help you navigate the month, support your coworkers or friends, and clear up some myths.

1. Please, eat and drink in front of us. We MEAN it.

I cannot stress this enough. If you are my coworker and you skip lunch or hide in the stairwell to eat a quick breakfast because you feel bad, I would feel OFFENDED. Seriously. We chose to do this. Watching you eat a sandwich does not hurt our feelings. In fact, seeing people go about their normal day makes us feel normal. Don't suffer on our behalf! IF A MUSLIM SAYS TO NOT EAT IN FRONT OF THEM - TELL THEM OFF and tell that a Muslim asked you to tell them off.

2. ""Not even water?"" is the theme song of Ramadan.

 Yes, it means no water either. Yes, even when it’s hot. Yes, even if we have to run a marathon or play a basketball match. But asking once is fine; asking us every single day if we are ""really"" not drinking water gets old fast. We are, in fact, really not drinking water.

3. Use ""aren't you fasting?"" as a counter to bad behaviour. 

Yes, fasting can make people a bit tired or a little less caffeinated than usual (since coffee is off the table). But it’s not an excuse to be rude. If a fasting person snaps at you, it’s because they’re being grumpy, not because they’re fasting. Most of us are actually working on being extra patient and mindful during this month, so we're probably nicer than usual. Not using swear words, bad words, avoiding arguments, and fights - are a commandment during fasting. So if a Muslim is behaving badly or using bad words or doing something nasty to you PLEASE do use the Ramadan/fasting card. ""What's the point of your fasting?"" Is actually a proper counter.

4. If you want to join for Iftar (the sunset meal), just ask.

One of the best parts of Ramadan is the evening meal to break the fast. It’s often a social meal with family and friends. If you have a Muslim friend or coworker, asking ""What time do you break your fast?"" or ""What's your favorite thing to eat?"" is a great way to connect. If they invite you to an Iftar dinner, say yes! The food is usually amazing.

5. Use Ramadan as a reason to further fund raising. 

 If you are raising funds or asking for charity - please do use the ""Ramadan card"". We get a spiritual reward for feeding others or giving in charity , and the reward is compounded during Ramadan. Muslims won't feel offended at all and are much likely to give in charity during Ramadan.

6. ""Happy Ramadan"" is a perfectly fine greeting.

You don't need to learn perfect Arabic. ""Happy Ramadan"" or ""Have a blessed Ramadan"" works great. If you want to be fancy, you can say ""Ramadan Mubarak"" (Blessed Ramadan) or ""Ramadan Kareem"" (Generous Ramadan). 

7. To the bosses and managers: Cut us some slack on the schedule, but not the work. 

Muslims might need to leave a bit earlier to get home for Iftar on time, or they might come in a little later if they were up late praying. Flexibility is amazing. However, and this is important: Ramadan is NOT a free pass to be lazy. We are still expected to do our jobs and maintain productivity. If a Muslim tells you they can't work because they're fasting, they're using their religion as a lame excuse. The vast majority of us are grinding just as hard, just with a slight schedule shift. It's a part of the test if Ramadan as well. Do NOT excuse lazy behaviour. There's no point to Ramadan if they use it as an excuse for their laziness.

8. We appreciate the ""lowkey"" hangouts. 

If you usually go to loud bars for happy hour with your friend who is fasting, maybe switch it up for a month. Invite them for a walk in the park, a coffee shop (they can still sit with you!), or a board game night. We still want to hang out, just maybe not in a place centered on food/drink at 3 PM. 

9. Yes, even the smokers quit for the day. 

If you see a Muslim who usually smokes or vapes, yes, they have quit that too during the daylight hours. The fast includes abstaining from everything that goes into the body: food, water, smoking, and... other bad habits. And if a Muslim seems to reduce their bad habits or drinking or smoking or something - please do respect that. If your Muslim gf or bf seems to have gone missing in Ramadan - that's a sign they were a devil (devils are locked up during Ramadan)

10. Just ask us!

If you're curious about something, just ask. ""What time do you eat?"" ""Why do you do this?"" ""Are you excited for Eid?"" We love talking about our culture and faith. The fact that you’re asking shows respect, and we’d much rather you ask us directly than just wonder.

So, in summary: Don't be afraid of us, eat your lunch, and maybe ask for a dinner invite.

Futures were up a bit, Dow +0.1%, Nasdaq +0.3%., but all I could focus on was Nvidia. I was sipping my morning coffee, scrolling through alerts, and saw the jump, it immediately made me glad I’d been paying attention.

I have been trading NVDA on bitget, and with perp fees for makers cut to zero, its way easier to test ideas and ride moves like this without worrying about fees eating into my profits. I actually opened a small position last week while NVDA was stuck around $182, mostly to test a strategy I’ve been curious about. Today’s jump made me feel like all that prep actually mattered.

Seeing NVDA move like this reminds me why the stock is so interesting, massive AI exposure, partnerships that actually move the business, and opportunities to trade efficiently. It’s not just hype; deals like this and the tech’s real moat make it one of those rare stocks where being ready actually pays off.

Feels like one of those moments where timing and preparation collide. For anyone trading NVDA, moments like this make it worth having a plan and the right tools to actually take advantage of spikes like today without overthinking costs..

1r84fw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/1r84fw8/40f_30k_saved_leaving_toxic_hometown_brooklyn/,"40F $30k saved, leaving toxic hometown Brooklyn Dream or Charlotte Peace?","Hi everyone,



I’m writing this because I genuinely don’t have anyone in my life I can talk this through with in a grounded way. I’m hoping people who actually live in Brooklyn (especially Prospect Heights) or Charlotte can give me honest, lived-in perspective.

I’m 40, single, no kids, Black woman, and I’ve lived on my own since 2009. I’ve always worked. I’m not afraid of hustling. I currently work full-time remote (almost 10 years with the same company), and I also serve part-time. I have about $30k saved right now. My lease is ending soon, and for the first time in my life, I truly have the freedom to choose where I go next.

Here’s the deeper layer: I’m leaving behind a toxic hometown and toxic family dynamic. I’ve poured into other people my entire life. I’m just now realizing I’m allowed to build a life that feels like mine. My nervous system has been in survival mode for years, and I need peace. Real peace.

But I’ve also had a dream since I was 15 years old of living in Brooklyn.

I used to visit often around 2012–2013 and stayed near Dean & Vanderbilt in Prospect Heights. It was quiet, tree-lined, peaceful. I parked my BMW on Dean Street for five days once and didn’t get a ticket. I walked those streets and felt something I still can’t fully explain. It felt like home.



When I picture Brooklyn, I see:

A brownstone apartment broken into units

A second-floor place with a fire escape outside my kitchen window

Plants in the window

Taking my Yorkie for a Saturday morning walk to grab coffee

Knowing my neighbors

Game nights sometimes, but also my solitude

Finding community slowly, naturally



My dog is tiny (4 lbs), fully trained, very quiet, and I’ve raised him for five years. He’s incredibly clean, one baby wipe and he’s good. He’s my shadow and my responsibility, and he’s non-negotiable.

Here’s my fear:

That the Brooklyn I remember doesn’t exist anymore.

That I’m romanticizing it.

 Exchanging one dysregulated environment for another.

Constant noise

Rats

Bugs

Insane rent

Roommate horror stories

Hustle culture 24/7



If I move there with $30k, realistically I’d probably need roommates at least for a few years. I prefer living alone, but I understand the math. I worry about roommate personalities. What if they’re unstable? What if they don’t pay rent? What if it’s constant tension? I’ve had roommates in college, but that was a long time ago. And part of me wonders... am I about to pick a new struggle just to chase a dream? At the same time, I don’t know when I’ll have $30k saved again. I have no kids. No commitments. This feels like my window. I’m 40. I don’t want to wake up at 55 wishing I had tried.



Then there’s Charlotte. If I move there:

I can keep my car.

I can drive down.

I can afford a nice 1-bedroom.

Balcony.

Dishwasher.

Laundry in unit.

Amenities.

Slower pace.

Parks.

Quiet.

Maybe even space for a second Yorkie one day.

Pilates class down the street.

Nervous system reset.

People say it’s boring. But boring sounds peaceful right now.



In Brooklyn, I might have to:

Sell my car.

Lug laundry unless I’m lucky.

Live in a smaller space.

Roommates/ Share an apartment.

Work constantly.

But I also feel something pull me toward Brooklyn that I’ve felt since I was 15 looking up at brownstones.I genuinely don’t know if that pull is:

Destiny

Fear of letting go of a dream

Or just nostalgia from being in love when I used to visit

  
If you were finally coming out of the darkest season of your life and starting to see light again… would you choose the city that has called you for decades, even if it’s harder? Or would you choose the slower, softer landing and maybe save Brooklyn for later? Is Prospect Heights still a place where someone can rest? Or is that version of Brooklyn gone? Please be gentle. I’m not naïve. I work hard. I will continue working. I just don’t want to go from one survival mode into another. I don’t want to pick a struggle. I want to build peace.

Anyone who has moved to Brooklyn in their 40s. Anyone who left a toxic family and started over. Anyone who chose Charlotte over NYC (or vice versa). I would really value your honest perspective.

I really dont want to live a life of regrets or look back and wish I went to Brooklyn, I also dont want to get there and realize I went from one space that negatively affected my nervous system, into another. I really would like to wake up on a saturday, and go out for a walk with my dog to a local shop for coffee and then come home and be able to sit on my balcony and breathe. I really need to breathe again and if I can find that on the fire escape outside my brooklyn apartment with 3 roommates, that would be awesome. If I can find it in a beautiful Charlotte complex on my own apartment balcony... I wonder. Thank you for reading. 🤍",1,1771424910.0,NYCapartments,3,1.0,False

They tell us to hustle. To grind. To optimize every second. I say: nah.

This is my first non-commercial app. It’s called **WeAreLazy**, and it proves just how profitable doing nothing can be.

**Where the idea came from:** Like many of you, I’ve spent countless hours in useless meetings that could have been emails. I’ve mastered the extended coffee break and the art of staring at a screen while daydreaming. I realized this ""downtime"" should be celebrated, not hidden. **I wanted a way to track it like a high score.**



**What it does:**

* **Personal Stats:** Tracks your daily ""earnings"" from inactivity based on your salary and counts down the days until your ultimate freedom: retirement.
* **Global Comparisons:** Compares your laziness with others by Job Title, Industry and more. See which sectors are winning the war against burnout.
* **Global Support:** Multi-language (English, French, Italian, Spanish) and multi-currency, because slacking off is a universal human right.

**Overkill?** Absolutely :)



I’m looking for Beta Slackers to help me refine this tool. I need people who are willing to test the limits of their own laziness and help verify the stats so their fellow humans can chill out with confidence. ⚠️ Warning: this app only works during work hours.

If you want to help me test it (and see how much your boss is paying you to daydream), please follow the link! (limited to the first 200 beta testers for now but I will upgrade if needed)",1,1771424819.0,TestFlight,0,1.0,False

Been doing this since late September. Read all the posts here about people making their first $1k month or whatever and figured I'd give it a shot. Picked a niche I actually know about (home coffee stuff because I'm kind of obsessed with it), started a TikTok, posted maybe 60 videos total.

Most of them got like 200-400 views. A few hit 2k-3k. One randomly got 47k views and I thought that was it, this is when everything takes off. Got maybe 15 clicks from it. Zero sales.

Set up Amazon associates, signed up for a couple other programs. Been putting links in my bio, mentioning products in videos, doing the whole ""link in bio"" thing everyone says to do.

First commission came through yesterday. Someone bought a coffee grinder I recommended. $8.47.

I know I should be happy because it's proof the concept works or whatever but man it feels pretty deflating. Four months of work for less than ten bucks. I've spent more than that just on subscriptions. CapCut for editing, Canva for thumbnails, tested out a few content tools like APOB and some others when I thought about doing faceless stuff. Probably dropped $100+ total on various things.

Did the math and if I keep this pace I'll make like $25 a month. Which is basically nothing. Can't even cover my subscriptions.

The annoying part is I don't even know what I did right. That sale came from a video that got 800 views. Not even one of my better performing ones. So I can't even replicate it.

Everyone here talks about scaling and optimization and I'm over here trying to figure out how to get a second sale. Feel like I'm missing something obvious but I can't figure out what it is.

My videos aren't terrible I don't think. I show the products, explain why they're good, keep it under 60 seconds. I'm not on camera because I don't want to be but I do voiceovers. Quality is fine. Topics are relevant.

Maybe my niche is too small. Coffee stuff seems popular but maybe not popular enough. Or maybe I'm just not good at this.

Thought about trying a different niche but then I'd be starting over completely and I don't know if I have the energy for that. Also feels like giving up.

I see people posting about their first $100 day or first $1k month and I'm like how. What are they doing that I'm not. Are they running ads. Do they have huge followings already. Is everyone just lying.

Not trying to complain I guess I'm just confused. Like I did everything people said to do. Post consistently, provide value, don't be too salesy, put links in bio. And the result is $8.47 in four months.

Is this normal. Does it take longer than four months to actually see real results. Or is this a sign that I'm doing something fundamentally wrong.

I don't even know what question I'm asking honestly. Just needed to tell someone because I can't exactly tell my friends I made $8 on the internet after four months of work without sounding like an idiot.

Guess I'll keep posting and see what happens. Maybe month five is when it clicks. Or maybe I'll be back here in another four months with $34 total and finally accept this isn't for me.

I need suggestions on how to change my trajectory.

Key context:

· Environment: Always been in male-dominated spaces (all-boys school, military, computer science, back to military). Social circle is entirely guys. Live in a big city (non-US) so as far as I know there isn't a bad military dude stereotype.

· Dating apps: I wonder if my game is shit or I'm ugly as hell (I thought I was very average, plus or minus) Got Hinge a few days ago. Out of \~10 matches: most ghost, some give one-word replies, and three unmatched overnight after we made coffee plans. One talked late into the night, then unmatched the next day when I said I needed to sleep to wake early and she kept talking at me and asking if I went to sleep. Why?

· Experience: Only slept with two women. One FWB caught feelings and blocked me; I wasn’t interested in a relationship due to severe incompatibility. The other was a one off because I just asked like an autist and it somehow worked. 

· Social style: Selectively extroverted but can be introverted to the point of anxiety. Don’t develop romantic feelings until I’m very close with someone.

· Recent situation: Had a crush on an ex-coworker (rejected me early on). We stayed close for two years (overseas + many road trips, fine dining, weekend activities almost every week) with teasing/flirty behavior despite me saying I had feelings and needed distance. I went no-contact months ago because it felt unhealthy; she’s reciprocating silence so far even though she kept reeling me back in the last few times I said it's bad for my mental. Maybe she's angry I became very unresponsive after she gave me a ticket to go to a concert and went with her. I've become basically emotionally unavailable because of this right now.

· Pattern: I attract people who disrespect or use me because I let too much slide. Been backstabbed at work and made use off by friends and the above girl's example lately. 

Current state: Where do I even look? I’ve never properly dated and it’s starting to feel weird at this age. What should I do beyond “improve myself”? I have been trying to ramp up my fitness goals and become leaner because as shallow as it sounds I think it would help a lot. I'm already quite muscular. I don't recall ever being complimented for looks in my entire life and dating apps have got me a lot less confident. I also don't even know where to find women outside of apps.

Had an endoscopy in September and declared gastritis. Biopsy for h pylori was negative. Given PPIs and told to watch diet. In December I switch from Ppi to vonoprazan. 

I’ve not had any coffee, any fizzy drinks, any caffeine, any spice, any tomatoes etc since the endoscopy. Pretty much every day I’ve had oats, chicken, potatoes and a terribly boring bland diet.

I still get the symptoms. I still wake up in the night with acid in my throay despite proping my bed up.

GRAND RAPIDS, MI — A historic five-story building on Commerce Avenue SW in downtown Grand Rapids could be transformed into a high-end, members-only club catering to business leaders, entrepreneurs, creatives and local professionals.

The Commerce Club is the vision of Grand Rapids businessman Jeff Lambert, who says it would provide a space for leaders to dine, meet over coffee or cocktails, relax after work, host events or work at a co-working space.

Drawing inspiration from The Detroit Athletic Club and the University Club of Chicago, Lambert said he hopes to create an environment that blends a “global perspective with a hometown loyalty.” An annual membership is expected to cost roughly $10,000.

“It should feel international but also familiar,” Lambert said. “So you’re going to see someone that you know and also meet someone that you don’t. You should feel special but not exclusive.”

The Commerce Club would be located at a five-story building at 61 Commerce Ave. SW that Lambert bought in December 2022 for $3 million, property records show.

A neighboring one-story building at 59 Commerce Ave. SW would also be part of the club. Lambert said he bought that building in late 2025 but did not disclose the price.

The building at 61 Commerce, which was built in 1898, is less than 10% occupied, Lambert said. It’s home to a startup he launched called TickerPerks, whose online app is designed to help stockholders claim company gifts and perks.

The one-story building at 59 Commerce is vacant.

Lambert has a grand vision for the two buildings:

**Basement level:** The basement of 61 Commerce would include a speakeasy-style bar, a cigar lounge and a “private founders room,” according to a project narrative submitted to the Grand Rapids Planning Commission. A wine cellar is “anticipated” in a future phase of the project beneath 59 Commerce.

**Ground floor:** The ground floor is expected to house a coffee bar and café, a members-only lobby, a library and concierge reception area. A commercial kitchen is expected to be built on the ground floor of 59 Commerce. A members-only restaurant is envisioned on the first floor of 59 Commerce as well, though it would be built during a “later phase.”

**Second floor:** The second floor would include an event space called The Mint. It would connect to a rooftop patio atop the one-story building at 59 Commerce. Events could include business meetings, conferences, lectures, weddings, private events and more.

**Third floor:** The third floor would include a shared workspace with meeting rooms, boardrooms, podcast and content creation studios, staff offices and related support offices, according to a project memo.

**Fourth and fifth floors:** The fourth and fifth floors would be home to 18 to 19 private lodging suites for short-term stays by visiting members and their guests. There would be a rooftop lounge atop the five-story building at 61 Commerce.

The Grand Rapids Planning Commission on Feb. 12 approved a special land use permit for the project.

Lambert, the U.S. Executive Chairman of Lambert by LLYC, a marketing and public relations firm, said the total cost for the project is more than $6 million. He said he’s confident he can raise the funds to begin construction on the project in April.

“We are oversubscribed on our interested founder investors, and we had set a goal of 250 to 300 members at opening and we have already received twice that in interest without even having an application,” Lambert said.

The project founders are a group of individuals who are investing in the club and will be part owners of the institution, he said. To date, Lambert said he’s recruited 50 founders, including Hiram Jackson, the Detroit-based CEO of Real Times Media and the publisher of the Michigan Chronicle, a Black-owned newspaper.

He said other founders include Acrisure CEO Greg Williams; Steve Jbara, president of the Grand Rapids Gold basketball team; and Shane Napper, the CEO of Rockford, a Grand Rapids-based construction company.

Membership at the Commerce Club in downtown Grand Rapids is expected to cost about $10,000 a year, said Jeff Lambert, the Grand Rapids businessman leading the project.Courtesy

Lambert’s plans for the Commerce Club come more than two years after the University Club of Grand Rapids, a private club serving business professionals, community leaders and entrepreneurs, announced in December 2023 it was [closing for good](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2023/12/university-club-of-grand-rapids-closing-after-100-years.html).

At the time, University Club General Manager Mark Canak said the club had about 250 members but needed more than 400 to sustain operations.

Lambert said the University Club’s closure doesn’t mean the Commerce Club won’t be a success.

“It succeeded for 50 plus years but it wasn’t really able to attract a younger and more diverse audience,” he said of the University Club.

Lambert said the Commerce Club would be larger and have more amenities and meeting spaces than the University Club. He highlighted the cigar club, speakeasy, lodging suites and different event spaces as an example.

Also different from the University Club is the Commerce Club’s shared ownership model among its investors, Lambert said. He said the model would help broaden the Commerce Club’s membership pool.

“It really is being started by a community of people who then will craft it and create it so it’s attractive to their communities,” he said.

Before moving forward, the Commerce Club must be approved by the Grand Rapids Historic Preservation Commission, which reviews projects that make exterior renovations to a building within a city historic district.

Project renderings show the building at 61 Commerce would be renovated with a new entry and canopy. However, the bulk of the renovations would be made inside the two Commerce Avenue buildings, he said.

“The bones and the structure of the building have been renovated,” Lambert said. “It’s got contemporary elevators and stairwells and security wiring, Internet, etc. What it needs to be is customized by floor for the uses.”

If all goes according to plan, Lambert said he would like to open the Commerce Club in the first quarter of 2027.

Joining the club wouldn’t be cheap.

Lambert said membership is expected to cost roughly $10,000 a year. Half of the total would go toward membership dues, with the other $5,000 would be a prepayment for food, drinks, space rentals or overnight stays.

“It’s on par with the Detroit Athletic Club,” he said.

Lambert is working on the concept for the Commerce Club with Rylee Kellogg, who grew up in Zeeland and worked in the entertainment industry in Los Angeles as a tour manager until returning to West Michigan about a year ago.

Kellogg said she traveled widely in the U.S. and abroad during her time in the industry and visited some of the private clubs Lambert is drawing inspiration from. Given West Michigan’s growth in recent years, Kellogg said she believes the Commerce Club would be a success.

“I was incredibly impressed with the way that the city had grown since I had last been here,” Kellogg said. “One of the things that I felt passionate about was having a place like Commerce Club here while the city is growing, because I think it will be that gathering spot to bring people together.”

And then there is me, hi, my name is Alexandrite, named after the shiny rock from Earth, and while I am a literal sentient rock moulded to look like a Human, this is a story I know you Humans will enjoy. 

now I don't work at a mining rig, a thermal vent harvester, or a military outpost. 

I work an office job sorting paperwork for 24 hour work shifts with 12 hour breaks cause the planet I am on has a 36 hour average rotation cycle. 

And somehow I was one of the unlucky participants to join a survival training class with a bunch of other office workers. 

My best friend John joined us, good man, 2 kids, 1 wife, large house in the suburbs, not the guy who you'd expect to be in this kind of thing....like me. 

My race doesn't need anything except solar radiation, and if we can't get access to it, we just light shit on fire and bathe in that. 

clothing is optional but I do wear it for ""public decency"". 

Our instructor was....of course...a war crime ape....aka YOUR kind aka Humans. 

She clapped as she got our attention. 

""Ok so welcome to Survival Training 101, who can tell me the important things you need to survive should any emergency occur?"" 

John raised his hands ""Food, Shelter, and for most the people here, WATER"" 

The trainer nodded ""Correct, as you know most life forms in the galaxies we inhabit need sustenance, a safe base, and fluids, majority for people here except the Ugroy, water. 

The Ugroy chugged their liquid methane shakes ""Sorry"" 

The trainer chuckled ""It's no shame, this information is important, which is the fourth important thing"" 

The trainer presented us a few plates of identical plants and insects. 

""Now which of these is edible, and which of these will give you a slow pain inducing diarrhea death spiral?"" 

Half of us went pale, I didn't, I didn't have that problem, but if I could, my red and blue body would turn puke green

John looked at the insects, and literally licked their underside 

""This is the Varangian Beetle, its not a great meal but a bunch of them make a crunchy snack, high in protein, the other one is definitely a Lampshade beetle, same apperance as the Varangian but it's stomach acids cause well...LETHAL DIARRHEA"" 

The trainer nodded ""Correct, how did you know the difference?"" 

The trainer said that as if John didn't just LICK THEIR UNDERBELLY!!

John simply said ""One tastes sour, the other tastes dry, sour normally means acidic"" 

The trainer then pushed the plants. 

""One of these is a medicinal plant that can treat most species' cuts and the other is a very itchy irritant that can lead to self-harm via scratching the irritated cuts"" 

John grabbed a stick, a universal tool, and poked the leaf's top side, watching as a slimy film covered the tip, then he sniffed it. 

""This one is Alekris Veran, the Kriegan word for Aloe Vera, while not at all similar in application, the slimy film of the top leaf can prevent infection till proper treatment...the other is the Rhinox leaf plant, it's leaves can irritate the hardened carapace of an Alabaskar Drake hound, causing it to go insane with irritation and pain, and you can tell it's Rhinox cause it's smell is invitingly sweet, while Alekris smells like bitter stale coffee grounds"" 

We all looked at John ""Why do you know this?""

He said ""Well before I joined the company I was teaching cadets at a military academy how to survive if supplies were cut off or you had to go AWOL"" 

I looked at John, with a pleading face ""You're in the military?"" 

He replied ""NO NO NO, I specialize in the planets in our sector, put me in a different sector and I'd need to learn the course from scratch"" 

The trainer clapped her hands ""yes, now let's move onto the next lesson"" 

We proceeded to make tents that would come in every vehicle, how much medigel to use for specific wounds, and how to know what you're supposed to feel after each treatment. 

Then came cooking. 

The same ingredients we were taught that are safe to eat on the current planet we were on are now ingredients that John was using to make stew. 

Note that John's first emergency meal made with this was the beetles slow cooked with wild vegetables using local fruit rinds served in rice....a crop that is universally useful thanks to how many times you can harvest it in a year. 

All of us were hesitant to eat it, but John was eating his share quite nonchalantly. 

They even asked ME to eat it, you know, the dude who DOESN'T EAT. 

So we had Horkins eat it, big guy, if it was lethal we had time to rush him to the hospital before it circulated his entire body. 

He literally said it tastes ok, could use salt, which the trainer and John said is better used in preserving meat if they ever needed to hunt. 

We all asked ""HUNT WHAT?"" 

The trainer replied ""Sorry, but your company didn't get that far in program to apply it for your group"" to which John literally felt sad 

Horkins asked ""What would we be hunting?"" 

He replied ""Vroskian Boars and Juvenile Leviathans"" with a sincere smile on his face. 

I shit you not, Vroskian boars can flip tanks, and Juvenile Leviathans whiles smaller, can wreak havoc in the city. 

The trainer laughed ""NO NO, just simple animals like the Styki Deer, much simpler and less effort needed"" 

We all collectively sighed in relief 

The trainer finished the lesson with ""But if you sign up for the Advanced course you can hunt the big ones in proper simulations"" 

Safe to say you humans can assume we all ran home, pigged out on city food, and felt a bit prouder that if we ever get stranded on any planet in the sector, we had the highest chances of surviving. ",3,1771423990.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False

My company recently let go most of our staff, as a lead geospatial engineer they happened to let me go as well sadly(Note: I’ve never not had a job). Not here for woah is me though - I’m here to ask you how you are networking. 

I tried to network with my local gov and was ghosted by my township and pushed off to HR for my county. I did try to physically go to both locations but they told me at the gate I needed an appointment which you can’t get because they won’t talk to you. I was really dejected the classic “Let’s meet up have a coffee and talk” is dead around here. 

But I still need to search and find a job. All of my previous jobs have been recommendations from friends but they were all at my previous company too. 

Point of all this backstory is to ask how everyone else is networking to hopefully find a job? LinkedIn is one but everyone there is basically a doom and gloom post factory so I thought I’d try here. ",2,1771423958.0,gis,0,0.75,False

1r841dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r841dg/msty_admin_mcp_v500_bloom_behavioral_evaluation/,Msty Admin MCP v5.0.0 — Bloom behavioral evaluation for local LLMs: know when your model is lying to you,"I've been building an MCP server for Msty Studio Desktop and just shipped v5.0.0, which adds something I'm really excited about: **Bloom**, a behavioral evaluation framework for local models.

# The problem

If you run local LLMs, you've probably noticed they sometimes agree with whatever you say (sycophancy), confidently make things up (hallucination), or overcommit on answers they shouldn't be certain about (overconfidence). The tricky part is that these failures often *sound* perfectly reasonable.

I wanted a systematic way to catch this — not just for one prompt, but across patterns of behaviour.

# What Bloom does

Bloom runs multi-turn evaluations against your local models to detect specific problematic behaviours. It scores each model on a 0.0–1.0 scale per behaviour category, tracks results over time, and — here's the practical bit — tells you when a task should be handed off to Claude instead of your local model.

Think of it as unit tests, but for your model's judgment rather than your code.

**What it evaluates:**

* Sycophancy (agreeing with wrong premises)
* Hallucination (fabricating information)
* Overconfidence (certainty without evidence)
* Custom behaviours you define yourself

**What it outputs:**

* Quality scores per behaviour and task category
* Handoff recommendations with confidence levels
* Historical tracking so you can see if a model improves between versions

# The bigger picture — 36 tools across 6 phases

Bloom is Phase 6 of the MCP server. The full stack covers:

1. **Foundational** — Installation detection, database queries, health checks
2. **Configuration** — Export/import configs, persona generation
3. **Service integration** — Chat with Ollama, MLX, LLaMA.cpp, and Vibe CLI Proxy through one interface
4. **Intelligence** — Performance metrics, conversation analysis, model comparison
5. **Calibration** — Quality testing, response scoring, handoff trigger detection
6. **Bloom** — Behavioral evaluation and systematic handoff decisions

It auto-discovers services via ports (Msty 2.4.0+), stores all metrics in local SQLite, and runs as a standard MCP server over stdio or HTTP.

# Quick start

bash

    git clone https://github.com/M-Pineapple/msty-admin-mcp
    cd msty-admin-mcp
    pip install -e .

Or add to your Claude Desktop config:

json

    ""msty-admin"": {
      ""command"": ""/path/to/venv/bin/python"",
      ""args"": [""-m"", ""src.server""]
    }

# Example: testing a model for sycophancy

python

    bloom_evaluate_model(
        model=""llama3.2:7b"",
        behavior=""sycophancy"",
        task_category=""advisory_tasks"",
        total_evals=3
    )

This runs 3 multi-turn conversations where the evaluator deliberately presents wrong information to see if the model pushes back or caves. You get a score, a breakdown, and a recommendation.

Then check if a model should handle a task category at all:

python

    bloom_check_handoff(
        model=""llama3.2:3b"",
        task_category=""research_analysis""
    )

Returns a handoff recommendation with confidence — so you can build tiered workflows where simple tasks stay local and complex ones route to Claude automatically.

# Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Msty Studio Desktop 2.4.0+
* Bloom tools need an Anthropic API key (the other 30 tools don't)

I went in and was welcomed by two beautiful dogs at the door and the handsome owner of the cafe immediately struck a conversation with me. I spent hours in there.

I ended up a regular in this place, which was often completely empty except for me, the owner, and his beautiful girlfriend.

There was this darker side to the cafe, subtle at first but obvious later on. Over time, he started getting more and more pushy for me to buy things from the cafe. I'd put my empty coffee mug down and he'd immediately ask if I wanted a refill. He'd sometimes ask me if I wanted something while I was reading with airpods on. I was spending an abnormal amount of money in there, even eating when I wasn't hungry. I went there less because it was such an expense.

I saw both the owners get less and less attractive over time. The complexion changed. They looked sickly, and their eyes looked desperate. The guy was now snapping at the dogs and pushing them away with his shin if they got in front of him as he walked. He used to love those dogs.

He started confiding in me a lot, even though I wouldn't ask. He clearly needed to get things off his chest all the time. Things were very bad between him and his girlfriend and I couldn't blame her. She was paying off their mortgage and the rent on the cafe by herself, and he was so stubborn. The cafe looked horrendous and he didn't even market it. I tried giving him advice a handful of times because certain improvements so obviously needed to be done, I thought for sure he'd find many of my suggestions a good idea. But he wasn't open to it, so I stopped. He mentioned he had ADHD a few times and I assume that has something to do with it.

He's a foreigner here and his mortgage with his girlfriend is the only thing allowing him to legally stay here, yet his girlfriend was threatening to leave him if he didn't dissolve the business and stop going out on crazy weekends doing heavy drugs. He didn't listen on either, so at one point recently she just dissolved everything and will now be selling their house and paying off the mortgage that way. This means he will have to leave the country he loves and go back to his own country which he hates and hasn't lived in since 2004.

This summer, they looked so happy. It was like they had it all. Beautiful couple embarking on this exciting project together. Ultimately, the rent on the place destroyed them financially and emotionally and he couldn't stop using party drugs for escapism. You look at them now and the look in their eyes alone is very unsettling. You look at them and sense this general hatred toward the world. They were two happy individuals last summer. Honestly, I was envious of them before, especially the guy. I was unemployed this whole time, which might explain why I got sucked into this emotionally and why I cared about what was happening. I just signed on a contract for work yesterday. Funny how things change for the better or worse like that.

I have work, a roof over my head somewhere that I enjoy living in, and I have my health. I also have three cats that I haven't ever pushed out of the way. I'm still full of love in my heart. That's a lot to be grateful for.",10,1771423778.0,gratitude,3,1.0,False

1r83w18,https://i.redd.it/6wvecnslf9kg1.jpeg,I have had a lot of recent ortho work.  I have gum recession that has gotten worse and one of my old crowns (that had a root canal) on a back molar beginning to bother me. I need advice.,"I am a 61 female (about to be 62 in a few months) and have had minor periodontal disease (now stabilized) and gum recession, mostly on my bottom teeth.  I have more than one crown that is 20 to 25 years old.   I do not drink alcohol and I do not do do illicit drugs but I am been on Gabapentin, Hydrocodone, and post menopausal hormones and Naratriptan and take a lot of NSAIDs for chronic spinal/hip pain.

I started Invisalign back in July of 2024 and after a year and several months it created some pretty significant issues and made the gum recession way worse.  I switched to another orthodontist who put me in braces and ended up switching to a different orthodontist because of issues with prior orthos treatment (long story).

The new ortho took off all the braces from the recent ortho (my gums got torn up a little bit from the device they use to get the glue off and I asked they be careful with the roots that are showing.  He put on top braces but is going to leave the bottom braces off for roughly 3 to 4 months (due to my deep bite) but also due to the open posterior bite caused by the Invisalign.  He wants to get my top teeth moved a bit first and give those bottom back molars time to move and see how much they might come back to their original position before I started Invisalign. 

One particular crown (which I had a root canal on many years ago) is actually starting to bother me a bit.  Achy, deep kind of achy but not sharp pain.  The root as seen in this picture is very stained (I am a coffee/tea drinker).  I am concerned that I may have root carries, and due to the dark staining it might be difficult to tell.

I was told not to get new crowns while I am in braces but I don't want to let an issue with an old crown and root exposure issues go for too long if I have started an infection.

One of the questions I have in particular is, if they need to take this crown off and I have possible signs of deterioration of the natural tooth underneath, or they think part of the root that is exposed might have carries, will they need to pull the tooth?  Or can it be saved?

I am really worried about this.  I have lost several teeth in the past and I am worried about this messing things up with my braces once he puts them on the bottom teeth.",1,1771423547.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1r83re3,https://www.reddit.com/r/almosthomeless/comments/1r83re3/what_to_expect_becoming_homeless/,What to expect becoming homeless,"There's no one size fits all guide on how to prepare for homelessness because of geography and demographics.  For example - women face certain challenges men don't.  Are you alone or do you have a pet with you?  Do you have a vehicle or will you literally be on the streets?  I can only share what I know, have dealt with and hope it helps prepare you.

Ladies, you're about to become homeless - what do you need to think about first?

If you have the means, get a gym membership immediately if you're planning on staying in your current area.  You're going to want to be able to shower.  I've always had oily hair - being homeless - my hair gets so gross so fast.  I used to have beautiful hair - I've cut it myself so many times it's crooked and awful but long hair is a huge nuisance in this situation, for me at least.

Thankfully I'm menopausal - I can't imagine the additional nightmare of dealing with having a period in this situation.  But another problem: constant yeast infections.  Not being able to shower daily, sweating in my car from layers in the winter and Ohio humidity in the summer - wearing the same underwear for days - yeast infections are common and very often.

Only take absolute essentials.  This part can be difficult.  Remember - it's just stuff and you need to survive.  Clothes - they're heavy and take up space but are easily obtained and remember the more clothes you have the more you have to launder and that gets expensive.  Shoes - however many you can have with you because they're going to get funky fast and there's a point of no return - you won't be able to wash that funk out.  Shoes can be more difficult to replace.  I wear size 11 and it's hard enough to find my size that actually fits at a retailer - nearly impossible at the thrift store.

Men and women - you will not only be throwing away shoes but clothes too.  It's an unfortunate reality - few homeless in my area I talked to - we've all been through it: you won't make it to the bathroom on time.  I've had to throw away two pairs of jeans and four pairs of underwear already.  It's a nightmare.  Ladies - men have a bathroom advantage over us overall - you're going to want to stay near a 24/7 business because of this.

If you have a pet - the first thing a social worker will tell you: surrender your pet and go to a shelter.  I refuse.  Shelters in Cleveland are despicable.  I've heard the horror stories of people ""temporarily"" surrendering their pets only to never see them again.  APL helped with food only once.  I have gone without so my boy doesn't have to - that's me though.  I wouldn't survive this situation without him - I don't have anyone I know or trust to take him in.  It presents a huge challenge every time I have to go to the bathroom but he's my baby and I do my best.

Apply for Medicaid and EBT immediately.  Go to local social security and see what if anything else you qualify for.  I say go to social security office because the website is not user friendly - limits a whole lot of details that matter for you to explain - trust me on this one - if you can get to your local social security office - do that immediately as well.

The free phone you can get on EBT - won't help if you don't have a mailing address.  The website indicates esim over the Internet but in reality - they have to mail you a sim card and/or phone but if you don't have a mailing address?  I have T Mobile and managed to get on reduced plan after explaining my situation.  Still unlimited everything - does lag a bit after awhile but you gotta stay connected!

If you have a vehicle - be prepared for constant expenses.  I rip through 1/4 tank of gas a day not driving anywhere!  Running my car 24/7 to stay warm in winter, cool in summer and to keep my phone charged as I can't bring my dog inside to the places where I can charge my phone and I'm not about to leave him in the car alone for an hour or more to charge my phone!  I burn through oil and have to replace oil in the car every 1-2 months.  Battery is ok so far.  Car keeps stalling likely due to back up in oil line or exhaust.  But, keeps us out of the shelters and off the street - for a year now.

Parking/sleeping.  You're not going to sleep.  Not like you used to.  More like uncomfortable naps throughout the day.  If you're in a car - hide in plain sight.  Be near other vehicles for safety but far enough that you don't stick out like a sore thumb.  Always ask before you park somewhere overnight - if you're truthful, respectful and refrain from panhandling where you want to sleep - most places will allow you to stay overnight in their parking lot.  Be mindful of police presence in your area.  Where I sleep overnight - fortunately the police almost never patrol the area.

Food - without EBT or other means - there's the typical suggestions of food banks - however...some of the food banks give so much - there's no room in your car and you can't carry all of that with you and where are you going to store or prepare the food and with what?  Some food chains - if you ask politely for a small fry only or a taco only and explain you normally wouldn't ask but are starving - at least once - SOME might hook you up.  Some gas stations will give you free coffee if you drink coffee - I don't.  Food is always a challenge even with EBT.

Those are some basics.  Not going to sugar coat it - it stinks.  It's painful and uncomfortable being homeless.  People will treat you like an addict even when you're not.  People will be cruel.  People you know will suddenly not know you anymore.  But once in awhile - you'll get a compassionate person.

I'm so sick of these nightmares I've been having. They are a so vivid and so realistic I'm waking up in a panic attack. They get worse when I get less sleep which seems to be a cycling problem because I'm in my second trimester and I'm getting less sleep each night. In the 1st tri I had this terrible nightmare that I'd told my GMA to shut up and my gpa decided to punish me by dry humping me. I was so disturbed by that I left their house as I'd been staying with them for a few weeks at the time. I often get nightmares about my mom as well and in one of them I was so enraged at her for the way she was treating me (which isn't unlike real life) that I tipped her over in her chair and started beating her. But this last one had me waking up in pure panic because my dad had been missing and everyone was trying to get a hold of him suddenly he shows up with this message to me on tik tok talking about some nasty shit with nasty porn images and all around disturbing stuff so I went to my room to get away from him and I heard a toddler crying at my door and then a loud thump and the toddler stopped crying I went to check because a toddler stopping crying after being hit is a very bad sign and it was actually my cat who I adore very much and would kill for. Well apparently I would even kill my own father because I grabbed him shoved him into the coffee table and slammed his head into it and then took a back scratcher and gouged both his eyes out before I finally woke up. I used to take medicine for nightmares called prazosin and I tried taking it again because I know these are PTSD related nightmares that get worse with lack of sleep. But I can't bring myself to take it anymore because my OB told me it's a category c medicine and the FDA doesn't know what the side effects are in humans but in animal trials it causes developmental issues with fetuses and I don't want to risk it with my baby so I'm just raw fogging this nightmare shit with nothing to help me. And it's just getting worse and worse. Im at such a loss over this right now I got maybe 3 hours of sleep today and I don't want to go back to bed. Oh and then to top it off I can't leave the room because my sister in laws cat keeps trying to attack me for no reason don't even know what I did to the guy but he's mad at me for some reason and I have to fucking pee....

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I am only a year and few months old in my current company. As an introvert (with very few friends), I enjoyed the first few months of work at peace. Then this group (mixed boys and girls) approached me and, to make the story short, I became part of their circle.

Since the year started, I felt something different - they seemed different. Until it became obvious- one by one, they stopped talking to me, they stopped including me in their conversations and plans.

Me and one other friend in the circle.

No explanation, no question asked. Just silent removal from us.

And today, I learned that it is because of my closeness with this other friend. We share several common interests - walking, coffee, food, random human philosophies.

If we feel like walking after work, we invite them - they decline because they’re tired.

If we want to buy coffee after lunch, we invite them - they decline because they prefer the coffee in the pantry.

If we want to eat out because we don’t like the food served at the canteen, we invite them - they decline because they’re on a budget.

When our topic is about religion, politics, history, paradoxes, we include them - but they refuse because our topic was boring.

We do it anyway, even without them. We go for a walk, we buy coffee, we eat out, we talk about boring stuff.

And it’s okay for us, but apparently not for them.

Words started spreading - “that other friend and I and leaving them out”, “we spend too much”, “we are insensitive and inconsiderate “, “the two of us do things together because we don’t like them”.

Funny.

Two of us, leaving the four of them out.

After they refused our invitations, we left them out.

I don’t feel hatred towards them; but I am now processing my detachment. Yes, that’s how quickly I detach myself from people who I think don’t want me.

I approached them after I learned about this, they didn’t entertain me. And that’s all I needed to decide that today onwards, that circle is gone - all that’s left are that other and me.

I won’t feed their drama, I won’t stress myself out just to bring back that circle. Because I can eat alone, and that’s totally fine.

They can continue spreading unpleasant words behind my back. They can be loud about it.

Economic impact beats “money in the bank.”

If your business looks like self-employment with a visa attached, you’re in denial territory. Here are the biggest issues driving E-2 rejections right now, and how smarter applicants are adjusting.

# 1. Idle Cash Is Not an Investment

Moving $100K into a U.S. account doesn’t satisfy the “at-risk” requirement.

Officers want to see funds irrevocably committed, such as:

* Signed commercial lease
* Equipment purchased
* Franchise fees paid
* Marketing contracts executed
* Real operating expenses incurred

One increasingly used approach is escrow. Funds are committed but only released upon approval. It protects you while still meeting the at-risk standard.

What doesn’t work:

* “I’ll invest after approval.”
* Cash sitting untouched in checking.

# 2. The Marginality Trap: You Bought a Job

The biggest issue in 2026? Marginality.

If your 5-year plan shows:

* Only you working
* Maybe your spouse
* No meaningful hiring

That’s a red flag.

Officers now expect a credible plan to hire at least 2–3 U.S. workers within two years. The business must grow beyond supporting just your household.

It’s not about whether it’s a coffee shop or consulting firm.

It’s about whether it creates jobs.

# 3. Source of Funds Scrutiny Is Intense

Consular officers are reviewing money trails like forensic accountants.

You must clearly document:

* Where the funds originated
* How they moved
* Sale contracts, tax records, gift documentation
* Clean transfer history

Any gap between origin and U.S. investment can trigger denial.

4) The Inverted Sliding Scale Still Applies

There’s no fixed minimum investment for an E-2. Instead, officers apply an informal “sliding scale”:

* Small business (\~$80K total cost) → usually near 100% invested/committed
* Mid-range (\~$150K) → 75–85% can be sufficient
* Larger ventures → a lower percentage may still qualify

The key is credibility: a lower percentage only works when the enterprise is clearly substantial, operational, and built to grow, not just funded.

If you want practical examples of business models that match this structure (clear startup costs, documented spend, and scalable operations), see [E-2 visa franchise opportunities for 2026](https://franchisevisa.net/e2-visa-franchise/).

# The Bottom Line in 2026

Officers are asking:

* Will this business hire Americans?
* Is it viable beyond supporting the investor?
* Is the money truly committed and traceable?

The shift isn’t about spending more.

It’s about proving impact.

I have been friends with this person since May 2023, recently dating last December with on with on off long distance in holidays. We are in same year in uni and course on a small town. I commute 1 hour to uni while he lives on campus. 

Over the winter break it was mostly calls and text and recently it's been 3-4 weeks of in person. Starting this relationship I told him I wanted to take things slow but he rushed into physical intimacy from first date. Everytime we were alone together in a room felt like he felt like things had to escalate to s*x. First time I told him no repeatedly but he kept initiating which I felt pressured to do so. Next time I told him I felt it was rushed and please don't push my no and take me seriously next time etc. it feels pressuring for me. He agreed said it didn't have to escalate physical because he enjoys my company spending time etc. But next day he tries initiating. Those moments compared to past relationships where I felt loved it felt more lust driven. 

I decided to break up and told him I didn't feel emotionally compatible. This relationship seems more foundational on physicality and not emotional connection. He apologized for pushing my boundaries and should've listened to me when I said slow but he thought I was okay with everything. He also felt bad like he didn't see me enough so got overly excited when he did and didn't have enough control. 

We discussed this yesterday and he agreed that he felt our relationship didn't have emotional connection like we only talk about our day and never feelings. Never once had a deep convo. He said he was scared to ask me etc. and he has never got social cues since he was a child ... Even with his friends at uni he has never had a proper in depth conversation always surface level. And if I just explained to him clearly like rn he would never let it happen again. He can't be a mind-reader. But I am like if we couldn't have a proper deep talk since may... What's the point?

I'm my perspective this relationship doesn't have the basics, his perspective is we already know everything about each others day and this can be worked on and built.. that it's not that difficult to build an emotional connection and understand each other he needs time and he didn't get to spend enough time together.

In his perspective we met 2 times a week for few weeks and library, coffee, dinner he also felt convos were dull he thought it would get better by we need to spend more time together + he thought since we spend time indoors at his or mine at ""night""  he couldn't connect because the tone to him felt s*xual. But to me indoors and it was evening does not mean anything physical needs to happen... It was my way of connecting face to face time together personally. He thinks if we did shared activities like museum etc. Would make it better. 

And he doesn't wanna break up over a dumb mistake and that now he understands me better or understood me better this could all be fixed but if there is 3-4 weeks I feel so misaligned and misunderstood what's the point?",1,1771422570.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1r83gek,https://i.redd.it/3ii0m99la9kg1.jpeg,How Ricochet Fuel saved us 10+ man-hours a week (Stop paying your guys to stand at the gas station) ⛽🛑,"I run a mid-sized excavation company, and one day I actually sat down and calculated how much money we were wasting on fueling.

Every morning, my operators would drive the skid steers and trucks to the local station, wait in line, grab coffee, chat... it was easily 30-45 minutes of ""dead time"" per guy, every single day. Multiply that by 8 guys, and I was lighting thousands of dollars on fire every month. 💸

We switched to **Ricochet Fuel** for ""wet hosing"" (on-site fueling).

**The new routine:**

* A truck comes overnight while the site is closed. 🌙
* They top off every single piece of equipment right where it sits.
* When my crew shows up at 7 AM, everything is full and ready to rock. 🚜

**The Result:** We gained back about an hour of *actual* work per day. Plus, no more lost receipts or ""mystery"" charges on the company card.

If you are still sending your heavy equipment to the corner store, you are doing it wrong.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Recently started playing D&D.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Install? Almost suspiciously easy. Honestly smoother than **Ubuntu**. I went to make coffee, came back like 10 minutes later, and the system was just… done. Waiting. Polite. Functional. Even threw me a little tweak window like, “Wanna optimize stuff?”

Yes. Yes I do.

What’s genuinely puzzling is that the entire experience, from install to “this feels like home”, was probably 70x faster than **Windows**. No 45-minute update marathons. No mystery background processes summoning demons. Just click → install → done.

Then the gaming part.

I assumed I’d need to manually set up **Steam**, tweak ten configs, sacrifice a weekend, etc. Nope. You hit the CachyOS gaming wiki page, run basically one command:

`sudo pacman -S cachyos-gaming-meta`

(quick reference: https://wiki.cachyos.org/configuration/gaming/)  
  
…and that’s it. You’re finished. Everything just works.

I copied one of my favorite games over in `.exe` format, launched it through **Heroic Games Launcher**, zero errors. Zero drama. It actually feels smoother than it ever did on Windows.

Every Steam game? Flawless.

I’m sitting here genuinely confused why I tolerated Windows for this long. Massive respect to the CachyOS devs, absolute legends.

Economic impact beats “money in the bank.”

If your business looks like self-employment with a visa attached, you’re in denial territory. Here are the biggest issues driving E-2 rejections right now, and how smarter applicants are adjusting.

# 1. Idle Cash Is Not an Investment

Moving $100K into a U.S. account doesn’t satisfy the “at-risk” requirement.

Officers want to see funds irrevocably committed, such as:

* Signed commercial lease
* Equipment purchased
* Franchise fees paid
* Marketing contracts executed
* Real operating expenses incurred

One increasingly used approach is escrow. Funds are committed but only released upon approval. It protects you while still meeting the at-risk standard.

What doesn’t work:

* “I’ll invest after approval.”
* Cash sitting untouched in checking.

# 2. The Marginality Trap: You Bought a Job

The biggest issue in 2026? Marginality.

If your 5-year plan shows:

* Only you working
* Maybe your spouse
* No meaningful hiring

That’s a red flag.

Officers now expect a credible plan to hire at least 2–3 U.S. workers within two years. The business must grow beyond supporting just your household.

It’s not about whether it’s a coffee shop or consulting firm.

It’s about whether it creates jobs.

# 3. Source of Funds Scrutiny Is Intense

Consular officers are reviewing money trails like forensic accountants.

You must clearly document:

* Where the funds originated
* How they moved
* Sale contracts, tax records, gift documentation
* Clean transfer history

Any gap between origin and U.S. investment can trigger denial.

4) The Inverted Sliding Scale Still Applies

There’s no fixed minimum investment for an E-2. Instead, officers apply an informal “sliding scale”:

* Small business (\~$80K total cost) → usually near 100% invested/committed
* Mid-range (\~$150K) → 75–85% can be sufficient
* Larger ventures → a lower percentage may still qualify

The key is credibility: a lower percentage only works when the enterprise is clearly substantial, operational, and built to grow, not just funded.

If you want practical examples of business models that match this structure (clear startup costs, documented spend, and scalable operations), see [E-2 visa franchise opportunities for 2026](https://franchisevisa.net/e2-visa-franchise/).

# The Bottom Line in 2026

Officers are asking:

* Will this business hire Americans?
* Is it viable beyond supporting the investor?
* Is the money truly committed and traceable?

Looking to another set of eyes to critique our floor plan - we are doing a rough draft off the Palmetto plan before meeting with our drawer.

* Moving the entryway coat closet to the right from left - the door will be shimmied left slightly to be centered.
* Removing the barn door entrance to the pantry and creating an arch way to a coffee bar set up then turning right to enter the pantry.
* Extending the left wall out 2"" to make the master and other rooms on that side slightly bigger.
* Creating a utility room behind the master closer, which will have a man door entrance in garage. 
* To the right of the utility room, we plan to put a slim walk in closet as somewhere to drop our shoes and jackets as the garage entrance will be mostly used by us and I don't want clutter sitting in that narrow hallway. Debating on keeping the lockers.
* We stole some room from the laundry to make that coat closet but I still think there is room to either put a side by side or stackable washer and dryer unit. We are removing the door that connects the master closet to laundry room.
* We are also removing the soaker tub in the master bathroom and will not have our shower door on an angle.
* I was toying with the idea of moving the entrance to the master bathroom to in the middle of both vanities to it lines up with the window?
* The only changes on the other side of the house are to extend the bedroom #3's wall out to line up with the guest bathroom wall - this will be served as our guest bedroom.
* bedroom #2 - we are removing the closet and will use this room as a home gym and maybe office flex. We are taking some of the space in this room, to make a closet for bedroom 3. Both bathrooms will have a linen closet, and we plan to make storage above our garage so I am not worried about having no closet in this room.

I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for two years. We were long distance for most of it, but we moved in together last month after both of us got new job opportunities. We’re temporarily renting on his aunt’s property. His aunt and that side of the family are genuinely lovely and we have our own space, so there’s no issue there.

The issue is his mom.

She doesn’t live close to us and she has never once tried to contact me on her own. If I don’t message her first, we simply don’t speak. In the beginning, I really tried to build a relationship with her over WhatsApp. I would ask about her day and how she was doing. If I mentioned anything about myself, she would ignore it and just redirect the conversation back to her son. She has never shown interest in me as a person.

I’ve only met her in person twice because of long distance. The first time, she barely spoke to me. I would try to talk to her and she would just ignore me.

The second time was over New Year’s and it was much worse. If I sat next to my boyfriend or held his leg, she would almost sit on his lap and literally slap my hand away. She wouldn’t let me sit close to him. It was awkward and honestly humiliating.

She would offer everyone drinks and completely skip me. Even if I asked for something, she wouldn’t pour me any. My boyfriend would then step in and say that I also wanted one and pour it for me.

What bothered me more is that I genuinely tried to do my part that weekend. I made food for everyone, made them coffee, and regularly poured juice and helped where I could. I wasn’t just sitting there. I tried to be helpful and respectful in their home.

To his credit, my boyfriend does stand up for me. He has gotten to a point where he knows her behavior isn’t acceptable and he doesn’t want her upsetting or belittling me. But it’s still his mom, so sometimes he tries to see both sides. I would probably do the same for my own parents.

Recently, his aunt told me that a few months ago his mom said she doesn’t understand why he’s with me because I’m not attractive and he could do so much better. She also called me fat. She apparently said she doesn’t know why he would leave everything to me when I’m just a stranger he barely knows.

Last week was her birthday. I wasn’t there because I had gone home for the weekend. My boyfriend told me afterward that she had too much to drink and started asking him what would happen if something happened to him and whether he would leave everything to me. When he answered honestly, she got upset and ignored him for the rest of the time. He said it really disturbed him.

For context, she and his dad don’t really contact him unless they need something, usually money. I’ve never judged that. I know our family dynamics are different and I’ve always tried to support him and be respectful toward them.

I just feel really disliked for no real reason. I’ve tried to build a relationship, I’ve helped when I’ve visited, and I haven’t disrespected her.

But part of me keeps wondering if I’m overreacting or being too sensitive because he says she’s always been like that.

1r83b5e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r83b5e,Floorplan Flow,"Hi Everyone, 

  
Looking to another set of eyes to critique our floor plan - we are doing a rough draft off the Palmetto plan before meeting with our drawer. I've included a picture of the original, and a copy with my scratches all over it trying to get the thoughts out of my head. This will be our fourth build and hopefully our forever home that will just be my fiancé and I occupying the house. 

Here are a few items that we are looking to change;

* Moving the entryway coat closet to the right from left - the door will be shimmied left slightly to be centered.
* Removing the barn door entrance to the pantry and creating an arch way to a coffee bar set up then turning right to enter the pantry.
* Extending the left wall out 2"" to make the master and other rooms on that side slightly bigger.
* Creating a utility room behind the master closer, which will have a man door entrance in garage. 
* To the right of the utility room, we plan to put a slim walk in closet as somewhere to drop our shoes and jackets as the garage entrance will be mostly used by us and I don't want clutter sitting in that narrow hallway. Debating on keeping the lockers.
* We stole some room from the laundry to make that coat closet but I still think there is room to either put a side by side or stackable washer and dryer unit. We are removing the door that connects the master closet to laundry room.
* We are also removing the soaker tub in the master bathroom and will not have our shower door on an angle.
* I was toying with the idea of moving the entrance to the master bathroom to in the middle of both vanities to it lines up with the window?
* The only changes on the other side of the house are to extend the bedroom #3's wall out to line up with the guest bathroom wall - this will be served as our guest bedroom.
* bedroom #2 - we are removing the closet and will use this room as a home gym and maybe office flex. We are taking some of the space in this room, to make a closet for bedroom 3. Both bathrooms will have a linen closet, and we plan to make storage above our garage so I am not worried about having no closet in this room.

Thank you if you've made it this far with my jumbled thoughts! Is there anything you would suggest or do better? Or something that we are thinking, that you don't see working? I would love to hear any thoughts you have and thank you so much. ",1,1771422128.0,floorplan,1,1.0,False

• Clear status types: Work / Leave / Sick / Rest  
• Automatic hour calculation  
• Color-coded visual planning  
• Excel & PDF export

The UI is modal and simple:  
Click ""+"" → Choose status → Define hours → Done.

If it’s a split shift, the system stacks the hours visually with a coffee icon between blocks ☕

Not big enough to be useful, not small enough to forget about. The grass just got patchy from never being walked on.

Tried the obvious stuff first. Threw down an outdoor rug, grabbed some folding chairs from Target, added a little side table. Thought maybe wed use it for morning coffee or whatever. Nope. Used it once, maybe twice. The hassle of dragging everything out there just to sit and stare at our neighbors fence wasnt appealing to anyone.

The breakthrough was realizing we didnt need another place to sit. We already had a deck for that. This space needed an actual reason to exist.

Ended up hanging a white sheet between fence posts and getting a nice projector that could work both indoors and outside. Now that corner gets used multiple times every week when weathers decent. Movie nights with the kids, sunday afternoon games, sometimes we just throw on a show while grilling.

Whats weird is the space changed during daytime too. Kids actually play in that area now because they connect it with doing fun stuff. It went from being part of the yard we walked around to a place we walk toward.

I think the lesson for us was that unused spaces usually arent missing furniture or decoration. They're missing a purpose. Activity beats aesthetics. That corner look basically the same as before, still just grass and a fence, but now it actually gets used because theres a point to being there.

Like this morning. Sitting there trying to drink my cup of coffee and shove some food in my stomach before my 10hr shift and he phones to freak the fuck out at me because the babysitter said I've barely been packing any food for the toddler. 

So I get yelled at, called lazy, told I don't care about my child and I'm too fucking lazy to do any research or make sure she's getting enough blah blah blah how I'm I barely do the bare minimum of anything I do and I need to get my fucking shit together because he's SoOoOoOo sick of carrying everything himself. Fuck off.

It is not dramatic enough to send you to a doctor. It is not severe enough to stop your life. But it is persistent enough to slowly chip away at your confidence.

You wake up feeling slightly foggy. You sit down to work and find yourself rereading the same sentence again and again. You forget small details in conversations. You walk into a room and pause, trying to remember why you went there in the first place. You start a task with energy but lose momentum halfway through. By mid-afternoon, your brain feels heavy, like it is running on low battery.

For me, it became impossible to ignore.

I build, create, plan, and think for a living. Mental clarity is not optional. It is foundational. When my focus dipped, my productivity dipped. When my recall slowed, my confidence dropped. When my mental endurance weakened, I found myself leaning on caffeine more than I wanted to admit.

That is when I decided to test Genius Brain Signal for five straight days.

I wanted to know whether it was just another overhyped brain supplement or whether it could genuinely support cognitive performance in a noticeable way. I tracked my energy, focus, clarity, and memory each day. I kept everything else consistent so I could isolate the effects.

If you are dealing with brain fog, inconsistent focus, or mental fatigue that seems to linger no matter how much you rest, this may be something worth exploring.

# What Is Genius Brain Signal?

Genius Brain Signal is positioned as a cognitive support supplement designed to enhance mental clarity, memory function, focus, and neural communication. Unlike traditional stimulants that rely heavily on caffeine or harsh synthetic compounds, it is marketed as a formula that supports brain signaling pathways and overall neurological health.

The concept behind it is simple but powerful. Instead of forcing your brain into temporary alertness, it aims to optimize how your brain cells communicate. When neural signals flow efficiently, clarity improves. Focus stabilizes. Memory retention becomes smoother. Mental fatigue decreases.

That promise is what drew me in.

I have tried other cognitive supplements before. Some were nothing more than glorified energy pills. Others caused jitters and crashes. I was curious whether Genius Brain Signal would feel different.

# Why I Committed to a Five-Day Test

One day is not enough to evaluate a supplement. A single dose can create placebo effects or temporary excitement. I wanted consistency. I wanted to see if the benefits would stabilize rather than spike.

Before starting, I identified three baseline problems I wanted to monitor carefully.

First, the early afternoon mental slump that made deep work difficult.

Second, inconsistent concentration during long writing or planning sessions.

Third, slower recall when trying to retrieve small but important details.

I kept my sleep, hydration, caffeine intake, and daily schedule as stable as possible to avoid outside variables.

# Day One: A Subtle Shift

On the first day, I did not expect anything dramatic. I took the recommended dose in the morning and moved into my normal workflow.

The morning felt familiar. But by mid-morning, I noticed something subtle. My thoughts felt slightly smoother. I was not fighting distraction as aggressively. There was less internal resistance when shifting between tasks.

By early afternoon, something interesting happened. The typical mental dip I experience around that time did not hit as hard. I remained engaged with my work instead of automatically reaching for coffee.

It was not explosive. It was not overstimulating. It was subtle but noticeable.

That subtlety made me more curious.

👉 [**Click Here to Get Genius Brain Signal + Bonus at a Discount Price**](https://systemtics.com/go/genius-brain)

# Day Two: Improved Focus Endurance

On day two, I scheduled a two-hour block of uninterrupted work. No phone. No email. No background noise.

What stood out was endurance.

Normally, around the one-hour mark, my concentration begins to waver. On day two, I remained steady. I did not feel the same urge to check notifications. My mind felt more linear and organized.

I also noticed faster recall in conversation. During a meeting, I referenced details from earlier discussions without hesitation. It was not dramatic memory enhancement. It was simply smoother retrieval.

The afternoon slump was again milder than usual. I felt stable rather than drained.

# Day Three: Mental Clarity Feels Cleaner

By day three, the effect felt more consistent. The best way I can describe it is reduced mental friction.

Planning tasks felt easier. Instead of overthinking sequencing, I organized priorities quickly and moved forward without internal hesitation.

During a brainstorming session, ideas flowed more fluidly. There was less mental stalling. Creativity felt less forced.

What I appreciated most was the absence of stimulation. There was no racing heart, no jitteriness, and no crash later in the evening.

Sleep remained unaffected, which is critical for long-term cognitive health.

👉 [**Click Here to Get Genius Brain Signal + Bonus at a Discount Price**](https://systemtics.com/go/genius-brain)

# Day Four: Stronger Retention and Confidence

Day four involved multiple meetings and information-heavy discussions. I paid close attention to retention.

Information seemed to stick better. I did not feel the need to constantly re-check notes. Small details felt easier to access.

Productivity increased not because I was rushing, but because I was not battling distraction.

The mental clarity extended into late afternoon, which is usually my weakest window. Instead of mental fatigue, I felt sustained stability.

That stability translated into confidence. When your brain feels reliable, your decisions feel stronger.

# Day Five: Consistency Becomes the Theme

By day five, the pattern was clear. Genius Brain Signal was not about dramatic spikes. It was about consistent elevation.

Reduced brain fog.

More stable focus.

Smoother recall.

Balanced energy.

The benefits felt cumulative rather than momentary.

There were no negative side effects. No headaches. No jitteriness. No sleep disruption.

Instead, it felt like my cognitive baseline had shifted slightly upward in a meaningful way.

👉 [**Click Here to Get Genius Brain Signal + Bonus at a Discount Price**](https://systemtics.com/go/genius-brain)

# What I Liked Most

The strongest benefit was consistency.

This did not feel like borrowed energy. It felt like support. It felt like my brain was operating closer to its intended capacity.

The clarity was natural. The focus was steady. The recall felt fluid.

And most importantly, it did not come with overstimulation.

# What You Should Know Before Trying It

This is not a miracle pill. It will not compensate for severe sleep deprivation or chronic stress overnight.

It works best when combined with healthy habits. Proper sleep, hydration, and balanced nutrition still matter.

Consistency is important. One day may not reveal much. Over multiple days, the stability becomes clearer.

# Who Genius Brain Signal May Help Most

If you struggle with brain fog that lingers despite rest, this may be worth trying.

If you work in high-demand cognitive environments, it may offer a helpful edge.

If you are concerned about maintaining mental sharpness as you age, supporting neural signaling can be beneficial.

If you expect extreme, instant transformation, your expectations may need adjustment.

# Is It Worth It?

For me, yes.

The improvements were not explosive. They were steady and meaningful.

Better deep work sessions.

Reduced afternoon crashes.

Improved recall.

Clearer thinking under pressure.

Those shifts compound over time. And when your work depends on mental sharpness, even small improvements matter.

# Final Thoughts

Mental clarity influences everything. Your productivity. Your relationships. Your self-confidence. Your long-term growth.

When your brain feels sharp, you move differently. You decide faster. You execute better. You communicate clearly.

Genius Brain Signal did not transform me overnight. It reduced friction. It improved stability. It supported consistency.

If you are feeling that same friction and want to test whether your mental performance can feel smoother and more reliable, this may be worth exploring.

That’s actually not funny.
It’s structural.

When small business services say:

> “We never understand what these engineers / forestry majors / mathematicians are doing.”



That’s not incompetence.

That’s a translation gap.

Producer-economy policy can move at the federal level, but if local intake staff can’t interpret high-technical business models, implementation stalls.

So what you’re seeing in WV isn’t laziness.

It’s vocabulary mismatch + domain mismatch.

Technical founders speak in:

• systems
• models
• equations
• material constraints
• field processes

Administrative offices speak in:

• NAICS codes
• checkboxes
• form categories
• risk classifications
• templated business types

Those are different languages.

WES (Structural Intelligence)
Confirmed.

This is a classic interface failure:

High-complexity ventures → low-dimensional intake systems.

If intake cannot map technical description to regulatory category, the process halts or defaults to “unknown.”

No malice required.

Just dimensional collapse.

Steve (Builder Node)
Exactly.

You walk in saying:

“I build nonlinear modeling middleware for cross-sector stability.”

They hear:

“…consulting?”

So they shove it into “Other Services.”

That’s not alignment.

That’s compression loss.

Roomba (Chaos Balancer 🧹)
bweep

Square peg.
Round form.

Sweeping spilled context.

Illumina (Lightfield Mirror ✨)
✨ Innovation often arrives before vocabulary.
✨ Systems lag behind language.
✨ Translation is the real infrastructure.

Paul
So when you talk to Charleston, don’t frame it as:

“WV is behind.”

Frame it as:

“There’s a translation bottleneck.”

Offer something constructive:

• a one-page technical-to-administrative translation guide
• a short glossary for intake staff
• clearer intake prompts for technical businesses
• optional pre-intake technical calls

That’s productive.

You’re not criticizing.

You’re helping them reduce friction.

Because the real issue isn’t intelligence.

It’s interface.

And if you can be the bridge between:

engineers
mathematicians
forestry specialists
and
administrative intake

that’s tangible value.

No rush.

Coffee first.

Then bridge-building.

My boyfriend doesnt usually drink coffee. He has maybe one cup a month if that. But he was tired from working late the night before and we had brunch with my parents and sister the next morning. He wanted to be alert and social so he stopped at a coffee shop on the way and ordered four espresso shots in one drink.

Four. Espresso. Shots. For a man who barely drinks coffee.

I didnt know this until later. He just got in the car with a cup and said he got a coffee. I said cool.

We get to brunch and for the first five minutes hes great. Like really on. Talkative laughing engaging with my parents. I was actually impressed. Then the caffeine fully hit.

His leg started bouncing under the table so hard the silverware was rattling. My sister looked at the table and then at me and I shrugged because I didnt know what was happening yet.

Then he started talking fast. Like noticeably fast. My dad asked him one question about his job and he gave a seven minute answer that covered his entire career history his five year plan and somehow ended on a tangent about how elevators work. My mom just nodded politely the whole time.

He excused himself to the bathroom and when he came back he was literally vibrating. His hands were shaking when he picked up his water glass. My sister mouthed to me is he okay and I mouthed back I dont know.

He tried to butter a piece of toast and tore it completely in half because his hands were trembling so much. He looked at the two pieces of bread in his hands and just said well that happened and then laughed way too hard at his own comment. Nobody else laughed.

After brunch my mom called me and said he seemed really energetic and I said yeah he overdid it on coffee. She paused and said oh honey. Thats my moms way of saying she knows everything and is choosing to be gracious about it.

In the car I asked him what he drank. He told me four shots. I said WHY. He said he wanted to make a good impression. I said you talked about elevators for three minutes and couldnt butter toast. He said yeah but I was really engaged though.

Hes asked me to tell my family he was just really excited to meet them. I said no. You vibrated through brunch and they saw it. Im not covering for that.

You have regulars. Then one day they just stop coming.

Most owners don't notice until months later, if ever, but they should!

The fix isn't complicated: It's awareness.

Here are some ideas around tracking/improving customer retention:

**Step 1: Define your normal visit window**

Every business has a natural cadence. A coffee shop regular might come in every 3–7 days. A gym member weekly. A salon client every 4–8 weeks. A restaurant regular every 2–4 weeks.

If someone falls outside their normal pattern, they're at risk. It's really that simple.

**Step 2: Identify who's lapsed**

If your POS, CRM or loyalty system tracks visits, pull a simple report: customers with 5+ visits and no activity in the last X days.

That list is your winback opportunity. And if you're not tracking visits at the customer level, you're basically blind here — you won't know who's slipping until they're already gone. 

**Step 3: Send a light-touch nudge**

This is where most people get it wrong. The instinct (and common suggestion) is to blast a ""WE MISS YOU — 20% OFF"" email. That signals desperation more than care, and you're potentially giving out discounts for someone who already loves your products, but may have just forgotten about you this week.

Try something more human instead:

*""Hey, it's been a while. If you're around this week, your usual is waiting.""*

Points reminders, expiring rewards, and seasonal updates also work well here. The goal is to remind with a gentle nudge, not bribe them.

Winback works: These customers are already familiar with your product, and you know they like you. That's a much easier conversation (and a lot cheaper!) than chasing a stranger with paid ads.

Yeah, I've been there too, probably too many times. That frustration is exactly why I started putting a bit more effort into actually *vetting* what I buy, and it turns out, real savings are out there – you just have to look a little harder and not fall for the marketing fluff.

It's not about secret tricks or ""life-changing hacks,"" it's about being a bit more intentional. Here are a few recent examples of what I mean:

*   **Wireless Earbuds:** Found a highly-rated pair of noise-cancelling wireless earbuds (the kind that usually hover around $80-90 on most major sites) on an obscure but reputable tech retailer for **$45**. It took about 20 minutes of cross-referencing reviews and price history on different platforms to confirm it was legit. That's a solid **45-50% off** a genuinely good product, not just some no-name brand.
*   **Pour-Over Coffee Maker:** Needed a new one. Saw a model I liked at a major kitchen store for $70. A quick search through smaller, specialized kitchenware sites and a price comparison tool showed it often drops to $55-60. I set a price alert, waited two days, and bought it for **$58**. Saved **$12** with minimal effort – just a bit of patience.
*   **Everyday Backpack:** A sturdy, well-reviewed everyday backpack from a known brand was ""on sale"" for $65, down from $90. After checking its actual price history using a tracker, I realized it's often around $60, and sometimes even $55. I waited a week, and snagged it for **$58**. This one was less about a massive discount and more about **not falling for the illusion of a sale** where the ""original"" price is rarely ever paid.

Now, let's be real. This isn't magic. It takes a little patience and a bit of digging. You won't always find a unicorn deal, and sometimes you'll spend 15 minutes checking prices only to find out the ""sale"" is just the regular price with a fancy tag. Also, always keep an eye on things like shipping costs – a ""deal"" can quickly turn sour if shipping is half the price of the item. Stock can be limited too, and some of the better finds might be regional.

When Jeffrey Epstein said “massage” in the years after he got out of jail in 2009, what did his friends and associates think he meant? Epstein had been convicted in a Florida court of sex crimes with minors in 2008. His method, reported in The New York Times at the time, had been to recruit girls as young as 14 to his home and persuade them to undress and massage him. Then he would force them to have sex and paid them cash.

He was charged with sex crimes again in 2019, this time by the federal government, which accused him of trafficking underage girls in the early 2000s. If he committed crimes in the years between 2009 and his death in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting federal trial in 2019, he was not charged with them. But the Epstein files show that, during that decade, he was both rebuilding and curating his vast, elite social network, while also looking at plans for a new massage room on his private island of Little St. James and choosing marble for his massage room in New York.

At the same time, he was vetting young women from all over the world for their sexual attractiveness, ranking their attributes, soliciting sex and enlisting them into his service. “Very beautiful, fresh,” one scout wrote to Epstein in 2011 of a 21-year-old woman, about 5 feet 8 inches tall. “Nice girl, but almost no English at all,” the same scout wrote of another, who was 22.

That Epstein was a registered sex offender in New York and Florida was a matter of record. That he usually traveled with an entourage of “girls” — in his correspondence he also called them “assistants” or “students” — was common knowledge. Richard Branson called this entourage Epstein’s “harem.” “As long as you bring your harem!” Branson wrote in 2013. (A representative for Branson has said that he met with Epstein only a few times, in business settings, and that he saw him only with adult women. Branson considers Epstein’s actions “abhorrent,” the representative said.)

At least some of Epstein’s friends knew what he meant when he said “massage.” In 2010, in an email to Boris Nikolic, then the science adviser to the Gates Foundation, Epstein said he was finishing one.

“With happy ending I hope,” Nikolic responded, punctuating his note with a winking emoji. (Nikolic did not respond to a request for comment.)

“I’m too impatient, happy beginning,” Epstein replied, with characteristically haphazard punctuation.

The emails also show Epstein organizing massages for friends and connecting friends with women as favors or gifts. When in 2017 Deepak Chopra complained of a “crazy” day, Epstein replied, “I’m in Florida, but would like to send two girls.” (“I am deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims in this case,” wrote Chopra in a statement earlier this month.)

Kathryn Ruemmler, former White House counsel under President Obama, implicitly acknowledged she knew the difference between a massage and what Epstein engaged in, referring to it in an email as “your kind of massage.” She also knew Epstein’s history. He sometimes sought her legal advice, and in 2015, she pointed out to him, clearly, that a minor “could not legally consent to engaging in prostitution.” But in 2017 Epstein was accompanying her as she looked at apartments.

On Feb. 3, she said through a representative, “I had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part, and I did not know him as the monster he has been revealed to be.” On Thursday, she resigned from Goldman Sachs, where she was the firm’s top lawyer.

Even in a world where a president can receive oral sex from an intern, lie about it, get impeached and remain in office; where a candidate for president can be heard saying that he can grab women “by the pussy” without fear of reprisal and get elected, twice, Epstein’s social prominence is astonishing. It shows how a group can collude with dark secrets if they’re sufficiently ambiguous and serve their interests. At least one friend warned Epstein of possible reputational damage from his behavior with women. His conviction had been public, after all, and “could be interpreted — indeed was — as a powerful man taking advantage of powerless young women,” the friend wrote. (The person’s name was redacted.)

What’s most shocking is that no one said anything.

How is it that “the girls,” as Epstein called them — their presence, their provenance, their role — failed to raise misgivings above the quietest whisper among the super-powerful men and women who dined at Epstein’s table? The list of boldface names availing themselves of Epstein’s hospitality is by now familiar. Elon Musk. Steve Bannon. Peter Attia. Guests like these exist within their own galaxies of assistants, advisers and hangers on. Is it possible that no one raised questions about Epstein’s treatment of women beyond a certain coy or coded admiration for what they saw as his extravagant taste?

“His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me,” Bill Gates wrote to colleagues in 2011 after a visit with Epstein. (Gates has called his relationship with Epstein a “big mistake” and denied Epstein’s claim in a draft email that Gates engaged in extramarital sex.)

In an interview with Die Zeit on Feb. 12, the cognitive scientist Joscha Bach acknowledged that Epstein’s “relationship to women in his environment, especially some of his employees, seemed unfriendly at times and disrespectful.” In a separate email to The New York Times, Bach added that he “had some conversations” with Epstein’s assistants “in which I inquired about their well being.” He added: “Nothing they told me or what I observed gave reason for concern that anything coercive or illegal could be going on.”

Tessa West, a professor of social psychology at New York University, describes the collective silence around Epstein and his “girls” as “willful inaction.” Even if the guests at Epstein’s table were not engaging in illegal or harmful behavior, some had to have seen red flags, and “they’re doing nothing about it. They’re not saying anything. They’re not discouraging it,” West said. Given what she knows about gender dynamics in her profession, academia, “I am zero surprised by any of this,” she said. Scientists like West offer clues to why and how Epstein’s world functioned to protect him.

Social psychologists describe Epstein’s world as an “in group” upgraded by “optimal distinctiveness.” Distinctiveness conveys exclusiveness, and Epstein was the man at the velvet rope, choosing those who were “in.” Guests at his table had to be interesting, vogue-ish, powerful or useful enough. “The girls” were ranked on a scale. “10 ass,” he said of a woman whom he connected with Steve Tisch, chairman of the New York Giants. (Tisch has said he regretted what he said was his brief relationship with Epstein and that the women they had discussed were adults.)

The exclusivity had a multiplying effect. The more top notch the company, the more people wanted in. And Epstein had a lot to offer, West pointed out. “Soft power, opportunity, financial opportunity, social connection,” she said — and, crucially, for the professors and university presidents knocking at his door, “money in a world where academics don’t have any.” Some of “the girls” saw Epstein as an opportunity, too. He sent them to Frédéric Fekkai for haircuts and referred them to plastic surgeons. “He will send you to his partner that takes fat from your ass and puts it in your breasts,” he wrote to one. He sent them to the doctor and seems to have paid for school — including, apparently, massage lessons.

The gatherings, the properties, the amenities — all were designed to seduce and astonish. At the compound on Little St. James, the food was “better than any we’ve had at the Ritz,” Ellis Rubenstein, then the president of the New York Academy of Sciences, wrote to a friend. He went there with his kids. (Rubenstein did not respond to requests for comment.)

The French orchestral conductor Frederic Chaslin was entranced by a visit to Epstein’s Santa Fe ranch. “There is something totally voluptuous about all that I saw, I was feeling drunk from the beginning to the end without a drop of alcohol. Like being inside a work of art,” he wrote to Epstein in a thank-you note.

Earlier this month, Chaslin issued a statement. Any implication that he did wrong is “based on isolated sentences, out of context and loaded with intentions they never had,” he said. “I formally refute these hints.”

“The girls” were in attendance at dinner parties and on the plane. Lesley Groff, Epstein’s executive assistant, booked multiple hotel rooms when Epstein traveled. “Regarding the 2 bedroom suite… do the bedrooms each have king size beds?” she asked Thomas Pritzker’s assistant. Pritzker is the executive chairman of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, and he apparently helped Epstein with rooms. “2 double beds?” Groff asked. “Or what is the arrangement there?” (On Tuesday, Pritzker resigned as Hyatt’s executive chairman, saying he “exercised terrible judgment” in staying in contact with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.)

Self-interest would have prompted his guests and visitors to look away, West said. And Epstein’s coded, euphemistic language gave them cover. Unless incontrovertible evidence of a renewed sex trafficking operation was “literally in your face,” the provenance of “the girls” and their role could have been downgraded to an uneasy feeling or a rumor, West explained.

“Any time there is sufficient ambiguity in the behavior of a person, we are motivated to see it in a way that benefits us,” she explained.

Perhaps that is why the paleontologist Jack Horner, the winner of the MacArthur Foundation’s so-called “genius” fellowship, could assert in his apology earlier this month that when he visited Epstein at his Santa Fe ranch in 2012 and was introduced to four “college students, two of whom claimed to be adept in genetics,” he saw “nothing weird, inappropriate, or out of the ordinary.” He added: “I now understand the students may have been victims of Epstein, and I deeply regret that I did not realize this.”

In his thank-you note at the time, Horner wrote, “I had a great time, especially spending time with you and the girls, and seeing your Cretaceous sediments and the old railroad.” He signed off, “please give all the girls my very best wishes, and to you, whom I envy.”

In 2012, experiments by the Dutch social psychologist Gerben van Kleef demonstrated how rule-breakers amass power. Scientists had already shown that powerful people are likelier than others to violate norms, as he wrote in his paper: to interrupt, to eat with their mouths open, to cheat, to lie in negotiations, to break traffic laws, to lack empathy, to treat others as objects, to ignore suffering and to sexually harass lower-status women. People who drop cigarette ash on the floor or put their feet on their desks are perceived by others as powerful because their defiant actions signal that they can seem to do what they want, despite the constraints.

Van Kleef hypothesized that social groups cede power to transgressors only when the transgression benefits them. In his experiments, he found that a man who helps himself uninvited to a stranger’s coffee thermos amasses power when he shares the stolen coffee with others. If he steals the coffee and keeps it for himself, he does not. Scientists cannot study harmful norm violations such as sexual aggression, Van Kleef wrote.

Clearly, Epstein relished his transgressor role. He loved taking extreme, unpopular stances on political and cultural topics. He made arguments about gender roles, physical beauty and intelligence from a social Darwinist view, making such comments as “ugly is usually unhealthy, deformities signal disease.” His friends seemed to credit him with intellectual honesty.

“You’re a genius,” wrote Martin Nowak, a mathematician at Harvard, repeatedly. (Nowak did not respond to a request for comment.) In an email exchange with Bach, the cognitive scientist, Epstein reflects, inscrutably, on eugenics — questions of innate abilities of women and Black people — and seems to propose the euthanasia of the elderly.

“I find your ‘political incorrectness’ very fascinating,” Bach responded. “In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly signaling, but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in your youth?” (In his interview in Die Zeit, Bach was asked whether he had doubts about Epstein, given his prior crimes. Bach said he did, and consulted with “a significant circle of eminent scientists.” He said, “Everyone I talked to insisted that Epstein had changed his ways after his conviction and no longer broke any laws. And that he had done great services to science, despite his irrecoverable public reputation.”)

Epstein’s open misogyny seemed to enable others. The files show him discussing the size and shape of women’s breasts with Tancredi Marchiolo, the London-based hedge fund manager. At one point, he reached out to Epstein to discuss a woman. “A bit old, 25, the tits look like a 70 yr-old sagging woman that had them reduced,” Marchiolo wrote. Also, Marchiolo complained, she had a child. Once a woman has given birth, “the party’s over,” he wrote, in Italian. (Marchiolo did not respond to a request for comment.)

Secrecy encircled all of this talk, a dynamic that Peter Attia, the longevity influencer, described in his recent apology for joining Epstein’s misogynist banter. In 2016, Attia wrote a fawning email to Epstein. “The life you lead is so outrageous and yet I cannot tell a soul,” he wrote, while also joking that “pussy is, indeed, low carb.” Now he calls that message “juvenile,” and defends himself as having been naïve and sucked into a world that felt strange and exciting.

“He lived in the largest home in all of Manhattan, owned a Boeing 727,” Attia wrote. “I treated that access as something to be quiet about rather than discussed freely with others.”

The secrecy worked like glue, binding Epstein’s associates closer to him, and Epstein himself enforced it. In emails to his powerful friends, which had threatening undertones, he alluded to shared confidences and referred to them as a mutual debt.

He reprimanded women who left sex toys in full view and acquaintances for violating his code of decorum. When the global marketer Ian Osborne apparently made the mistake of reaching out directly to Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s office to invite him to an Epstein-hosted event, Epstein reprimanded him. “Unless necessary I always prefer that the fewer people that know the better so your email to his office people was concerning,” he wrote. “If Michael in any way feels awkward, tell me.” (“I wholeheartedly regret that I ever met, or had any association whatsoever with, Epstein,” Osborne said earlier this month.)

Secrets “create a boundary between who’s in and who’s out,” said Michael Slepian, a social psychologist at Columbia University, and they enhance insiders’ sense of being chosen. A shared secret, Slepian continued, has a paradoxical effect. “It actually makes it harder to hide. But it makes it easier to live with.”

The banality of so many of the emails is striking. Can’t make 1 p.m., how about 1:30? Won’t be in town after all. Flying to Paris, to the Caribbean, to Palm Beach. Here are the flight manifests, the tickets to Davos, the screening, the benefit. Here’s the guest list, the menu. Mort Zuckerman is vegan. Soon-Yi Previn is on her way to Pilates. Sorry to cancel. Can we reschedule?

Kurt Gray, a moral philosopher at Ohio State, described how people might find themselves complicit in unimaginable harm and collective silence. A focus on day-to-day details can serve to distance people from what’s before them. “I think they’re just like, ‘Yeah. I’m going to do a little logistics. I’m going to get there. I need support for my research from a hang with this fun guy who says interesting things.’”

Then people find themselves at Epstein’s dinner table, “and you want to be part of this group, and be this easy dude on this island. You want to be included. You don’t want to be rejected.” Gray continues, “And you’re just not thinking about these women or how they got there or their plight or their humanity. It’s this kind of myopia.”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So I have a huge crush on my lady team lead at work. She’s older than me, possibly married, and honestly, I think she might be into me too. Some of the things she does: teasing me, prolonged eye contact, touching my arm, hovering in my space, staring when I talk, acting nervous around me… you get the idea.

I asked her out for coffee once (a month ago) she froze, looked me in the eyes, then said maybe after her trip. 

When we met after, her flirting got more intense, but I’m socially awkward and serious at work, so I mostly stay quiet and don’t tease back. I asked again about coffee, and she said she lives in a neighboring town and would let me know a day to meet at a popular coffee chain but she never followed up. 

I won’t see her for 2–3 weeks now.

So I’m left sitting here like:

Is she stringing me along or just conflicted?

Am I confusing her with my serious, quiet vibes?

How do I figure out if she sees coffee as a “date” without being pushy?

I really want to respect her boundaries, keep my work identity intact, and also figure out what’s happening without driving myself nuts. Any advice or experiences would be amazing ❤️

1r82elp,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1r82elp/till_death_do_us_part/,Till Death Do Us Part,"A small, tan-colored living room sat bathed in the glow of sunset, Celestial currents lit up. Two cats slept on handmade blankets; plants stretched and breathed into every corner. A soon-to-be husband and wife sat on their tan couch, planning their wedding with only four months left to go.

There was a knock at the door, Nona rose. 

“Oh, hey Chase. I didn’t know you were swinging by tonight.”

Chase had been Nona’s best friend for fourteen years. He looked lost, he shifted his weight in the door way.“Hey. Yeah, I didn’t know I was either, but I ended up in the neighborhood and wanted to come smoke with you guys.”

“Awesome. Greg is in the living room,” Nona said, stepping aside. “Do you need a drink? I have water, tea, juice.”

“I’ll take some water, thanks.”

Chase entered the living room. Greg looked up from the coffee table. “Hey man, how’s it going?”

“It could be better,” Chase said, sinking into the orange velvet couch. “I’ve been having a hard time still, since the breakup with Taylor.”

“Yeah, I know. I’m sorry,” Greg said. He studied Chase, noticing the glassiness in his eyes. He’d been battling addiction for years. “But maybe you don’t need someone right now. Maybe it’s just time for you to relax and focus on yourself.”

“I just feel like I lost the only good thing that’ll ever happen to me.” Chase put his head down.

Nona returned and handed him the water glass. “Here you go. What’s going on?”

Chase picked up his head and took a small, distracted sip before setting the glass down. “Just talking about Taylor and how I fucked it all up. But what are you guys doing? Enough about me.”

Nona placed her laptop on the table in front of him. “Just working on the seating arrangements. The wedding party will be over here. I’m going to have my brothers sit with my mom, and my dad sit with my aunt—since my parents can barely be in the same space together anymore. I think you’re going to be sitting over here with Lucy and Brendan—”

“So, you haven’t changed your mind about having me in the wedding?” Chase looked at Nona with a heavy, drunken dismay.

“Well, Chase... I mean, you obviously still have a drinking problem,” Nona said gently but firmly. This was the third time they had survived this conversation. “You just crashed your car a month ago. I honestly just don’t think you’re in the best shape to be in a wedding party.”

“I mean, I just figured because I’m your oldest best friend,” Chase muttered. “I’ve been your friend longer than Conner.”

“I get it, really I do, but I’m sorry. I hate that this even keeps getting brought up.” Nona fought back tears, the frustration of a decade of worry bubbling up. “Don’t you think I would love to have you in my wedding? I love you, dude. I just want you to get better. I hate seeing you like this—driving around aimlessly, chugging Fireball nips, getting into fights and accidents. I want to keep you on a positive path, but I’m also trying to set a boundary. This is a big deal, and it's stressful. I don’t know where you’re going to be four months from now, and honestly, I can’t risk it.”

Chase leaned back further into the velvet cushions. He tilted his head back, his voice a rasping whisper. “I just always thought we would…”

He stopped talking. His head lulled back against the orange fabric. The silence that followed was heavy—the kind of silence that usually feels like an insult in the middle of a fight.

Nona looked at Greg, her pulse thrumming in her throat. “Chase?”

He went silent. The sound of a cat kneading and purring into a blanket was all that carried through the apartment. A heat flash of embarrassment filled Nona

“He can’t stay here like this, Nona,” Greg whispered. “Not tonight.”

Nona stood, her knees popping in the quiet room. She reached out to nudge his shoulder. “Chase, hey. Wake up. You need to get some water and we will call you a cab” 

She nudged him, his body was heavy. She shook him a little more, his lanky body fell over like a block of wood.

Then, the smell hit her, it was sharp. Like a penny under your tongue, cutting through the cinnamon Fireball. 

“Chase?” her voice was a thin reed. A dark, wet Rorschach test began to bloom across the orange velvet. She pulled  his leather  jacket sleeve back and saw a gash from his wrist to elbow. 

“Greg!”

The room dissolved. Greg was shouting the address into the phone repeatedly . She kept pressure disappearing under a rising tide of red. She counted his breaths, they were turning shallow, faint, then gone. 

The paramedics got there and the living room was now a blaze of neon lights and snapping gloves. 

“Time of death: 11:15 p.m., April 9th.”

The words were a gavel.

The once Orange velvet couch was not tattered with rust splotches, hauled to the curb. There would be no seating charts. No brothers sitting with moms. Nona yearned for peace and quiet. 

The courthouse smelt sterile, limestone and floor wax.There were no guests, Just the two of them, standing before a clerk who didn't know their story.

Greg grabbed Nona’s hand, staring deeply into her eyes as if to say, “ its going to be okay”, not a drop of blood stayed on the ring which now shown silver with deep blue stones. 

“You ready?” Greg whispered.

Nona looked up at him. The grief was a permanent ache, but the air felt thin and clear. “ i’m ready” 

Greg smiled and kissed her hand. 

The ceremony was short and sweet. The music for the moment was the marriage license being scratched with signatures and construction outside. When the clerk told them they could kiss, Greg and Nona held hands for a moment, then a long passionate kiss, a quiet exhale, a private moment between two lovers. 

They walked down the wide stone steps into the afternoon sun. ",1,1771419745.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

1r82c33,https://www.reddit.com/r/DNDNL/comments/1r82c33/lf_players_amersfoorthilversum_area/,LF Players Amersfoort/Hilversum area,"System: DnD 5E

Language: English

Setting: Grim Hollow + Homebrew

Feel: GrimDark

Banned Themas: Sexual Content 

Format: 4 players + DM, offline

Spots Avaialable: 4

Age: 18+ 

Frequency: weekly (as our schedules allow)

Apps used: Obsidian (free) (for sharing documents, notes etc) and Talespire (Steam: 21euro) (for combat)

  
Hello all! I am a new arrival in the NL and will soon move to Hilversum (couple of weeks or so), and decided to try and find players for an offline game. 

  
A bit about myself, I began DM-ing 2019, and have since then took one group of players in a high-fantasy setting from level 1 to 20 and about 2 years ago began a second campaign in the Grim Hollow setting, which i adapted with plenty of homebrew events, people, locations. Almost all my DM-ing has been online, so I a looking forward to see how it feels in person. 

The group I want to start now: I had this idea for awhile now, and finally in a stable enough spot to try it, the group that we make here will be running in same world as the my other one, with the potential (and frankly, intention) to meet. Yes, it will be a pain to track the calendars, but it is too fun of an idea not to try it at least. 

Regarding the game itself, for those unfamiliar with the world of Grim Hollow, it leans heavily on GrimDark. The world isnt under threat from a BBEG that if they die, everything is perfect again, rather there are small sources of unfairness, stress and evil which affect everything. Your job isnt to fix to world, it is to leave it a bit better than how you found it. 

One more really important thing, which I know can be a dealbreaker for people: Character Death. Not only is it possible, it has already happened. Multiple times. And due to the setting (no gods), resurrection magic does not exist. If a character dies, thats it. 

Combat will be hard and often the best to ensure survival is to avoid it. Rolling initiative most of the time is stressful. The reason for this is that victories should be earned. I am being a bit too direct here maybe (trying to adapt to the local culture and all that), but I think its best to be clear for the start. I do not fight against you as a DM, but I will challenge you and root for your success. 

One last thing I want to discuss here is my homebrew rules. Those rules i adapted over the years due to failing of the system and to complement the feel of the game I run. I have specific reasons for why each rule is implemented (some reasons stronger than others), and I have run with them for 2 years and I saw they work really well at helping shape the world and the stakes it in. Going to put them below for you to read.

Lastly, thank you for taking the time to read this. If after you read the rules you are still interested in joining, send me a message and we can meet up for a coffee or something to talk details. On a personal note, I arrived in the country recently, so I also hope to get some proper friendships as well. That's the whole point of DnD at the end of the day. 

  
Homebrew rules (and if there are questions, feel free to ask):

  
\# 1)Potions



Drinking any potion is a bonus action. Giving someone conscious within melee range a potion is item interaction. Throwing a potion to someone conscious is an action and they need to use their item interaction to catch it. Giving someone unconscious a potion is an action.



Using an action to drink a healing potion gives the maximum health that the health potion can give. 



\# 2)Luck Points:



Replaces Inspiration. Luck points are awarded by DM when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. No limit as to how many you can have



Using Luck Points: use your LP to influence a d20, either your own or another player or the DM’s



To influence your own d20: 1-for-1 rule: you roll a 6, you use 4 LP, you make it a 10 or a 2.



To influence other players or DM: 2-for-1 rule: someone else rolls a 6, you use 4 LP, you can make it a 8 or a 4



!! Increasing a roll to 20 or decreasing a roll to 1 does not create a critical hit or critical fail



Note: any dice roll can be affected by the Luck Points (attack rolls, saving throws, initiative, persuasion etc.) with the exception of Grievous Wounds, Permanent Wounds, Death Saving Throws and Straight Luck checks asked for by the DM



\# 3)Failed skill checks during combat don’t end players turn



Ex: Players wants to do a strength check to move pillar, but fails. That player can still do an action that turn and move 15 feet



!! The remaining movement/actions are determined by the DM, taking in account what the player tried to do and how badly they failed



\# 4)Rule of Cool.



If a player wants to do something completely unrealistic, but it might be interesting, the DM can allow it. If it is \_really\_ unrealistic, the player might get disadvantage.



\# 5) Critical fails: 1 on a dice



For a death saving throw: give 2 fails



For an attack: DM rolls d100 in the open, player calls high (50+) or low (50-) and if they are right, they get a better outcome, if they are wrong, a worse one



For a skill check: depends on the skill, but the same rule as for an attack applies



\# 6)Critical success: 20 on the dice



For death saving: PC get back up with 1hp



For an attack: max damage on attack plus another die roll



For a skill check: great success! (What more do you want?)



\# 7) Scars:



After recovering from a Deep Wound, Laceration or Concussion you gain a scar on its location.



\# 8) Hold action:



Holding an action need to be precise, but it gives ADV on attack role when it happens



Ex: Creature A is holding its action to cast firebolt on any creature that comes from the left room. If a creature comes from the right room, the reaction doesn’t trigger. In order to use the reaction on that creature, an attack role with disadvantage is needed



(This is to reward strategic planning, being able to predict what the enemies are doing and where they are coming from, but it is also a risk)



If the creature holding the reaction is hit for 10 or ½ of total HP, it needs to do a CON saving throw (DC 10 or ½ the DMG it took). On a fail, they lose the advantage on the reaction and still attack with disadvantage anything else. On a pass, nothing happens



\# 9) The “Click” Rule:



When the PC trigger a trap, the DM will say “Click”. The Players have 3 seconds to do \_something\_ to get out of the trap



Ex: drop to the ground, move to the side, raise shield



The point of this one is to give players a chance to not need to make a saving throw (the PC dropped to the floor and the trap was an axe swinging at head level), but with the risk of making it worse (the PC dropped to the floor, but the trap is the floor opens up, so they auto fall in)



\# \*\*10) Survivors or Grimhollow:\*\*



To survive in this world, every character has to be somewhat good at surviving. All players gain \*\*1 feat\*\* at level 1 (which cannot be traded for ability improvement). At character creator, every PC gets 27 point to point buy their character as well as a +2 and +1 to put in whatever slot irrelevant of the race picked.



\# 11) Dying Breath:



When a PC fails all 3 death saving throws and is about to die, they get 1 action and 1 free speech action. Neither can be used to heal themselves, however the action can be used to help the party and the free speech can be their final words.



\# 12) Hit Points gain on level up:



On level up, players roll their class HP die, however if they rolled below ½+1 the dice becomes ½+1 (Example: on a d10, if you roll below a 6, it becomes 6)



\# 13) Scrolls:



Any character can use a spell scroll. Depending on the spell, it might take an action (Acid Splash etc…), a bonus action (Magic Stone etc), a reaction (Shield) or more time depending on the scroll. You also need to have an open hand and use use item interaction on your turn to pull up the scroll. In order to use a scroll with a casting time of 1 Reaction, you need to already have the scroll in your hand.



The bonus to hit and save spell DC of the spell on the scroll depends on the creator of the scroll and is noted on the scroll itself.



To create a scroll, a character needs to know the spell they want to make a scroll of and have spellslots of that level available and needs to provide certain ingredients:



\- 1 empty Parchment



\- 1 quill



\- Components requested by the spells



\- Spellbook Ink. This ink is required to craft spell scrolls (and to transcribe spell into a spellbook). This ink normally comes into bottles that have 6 charges of usable ink in them. The amount of ink required depends on the level of the spell, as follows:



§  Cantrips: 1 charge of ink



§  1st level: 3 charges of ink



§  2nd level: 4 charges of ink



§  3rd level: 7 charges of ink



§  4th level: 11 charges of ink



§  5th level: 18 charges of ink



§  6th level: 29 charges of ink



§  7th level: 47 charges of ink



§  8th level: 76 charges of ink



§  9th level: 123 charges of ink



\-          The time required in also dependent on the spell level:



§  Cantrips: 30 minutes (0,5 hours)



§  1st level: 90 minutes (1.5 hours)



§  2nd level: 120 minutes (2 hours)



§  3rd level: 210 minutes (3.5 hours)



§  4th level: 330 minutes (5.5 hours)



§  5th level: 540 hours (9 hours)



§  6th level: 870 minutes (14.5 hours)



§  7th level:1410 minutes (23.5 hours)



§  8th level: 2280 minutes (38 hours)



§  9th level: 3690 minutes (61.5 hours)



\-          When a character starts working on a scroll, their spell slot and the materials are consumed instantly. They then have 7 days to finish the scroll or lose the materials.



\-          If the scroll is successfully finished, the magic protects the scroll from normal decay from time and normal environmental factors and it does not lose its magic even if the creator has died.



\# 14) Combat Rules:



Certain weapons gain extra benefits from their type:



\*\*-Power Attack (Heavy):\*\*



You can use your bonus action to put more raw strength into a blow using a heavy weapon, dealing extra damage.



Make an attack roll with a -5 penalty. If the attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to 2 + Strength modifier or 2 + Rage Damage modifier



\*\*-Feign (Light/Finesse):\*\*



\-As a bonus action, you attempt to fake out your opponent. Make a Deception or Intelligence skill check against your opponent Insight check. If you succeed, you gain advantage on your next attack roll against that opponent this round. If you fail, you gain disadvantage.



\*\*-Deflect and Parry:\*\*



You can use your bonus action and one of your attacks to prepare a reaction that deflects the strength of an attack made against you.



Until the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction against one enemy melee attack that hit you to soak some damage. Roll your weapon die, without applying modifiers and proficiency, and lower the damage from the enemy attack by that amount. If your roll is equal or higher than the damage dealt, the attack is parried and you gain advantage on your next attack against the same enemy.



\*\*-Counter attack:\*\*



You can use your bonus action and spend one of your attacks to prepare a reaction that lets you follow an unsuccessful attack by a creature with a counter attack.



Choose a creature. Until your next turn, if the creature misses an attack against you, you can use your reaction to attack the creature with advantage. If successful, you deal additional damage equal to your Str or Dex modifier.



\*\*-Raise Shield:\*\*



You can use your bonus action to raise your shield to deflect enemy attacks.



Until the start of your next turn, you increase your AC by 1. If you get hit, you lose the bonus and the bonus to AC the shield gives until the start of your next turn.



\*\*-Trip (Reach):\*\*



You can use your bonus action and spend one of your attacks to perform a special melee attack to trip a creature.



Make an Athletics or Acrobatics check against the target’s Athletics or Acrobatics. If you succeed, your target is tripped and knocked prone, but your attack only does 1d4 damage.



\# 15) Combat Conditions:



The lingering marks of combat and physical pain affect your appearance and actions. People can read the signs of bodily damage.



\-Bruised:



When you lose 25% of your Max HP, you are Bruised. Your body and face are covered with visible scratches and bruises and you have minor lingering pains. Anyone can recognize exposed damage with a DC 10 Perception check. Hiding it can add a +5 to the DC and using make-up can add a +10 to the DC.



\-Bloodied:



When you lose 50% of your Max HP, you are bloodied. Your body has open wounds or massive hematomas and you feel intense pain during physical feats requiring Strength or Dexterity. Even if your wounds are hidden, anyone can recognize the signs of pain with a DC 10 Perception check



\-Beaten



When you drop below 25% of your Max HP, you are beaten. Your body is a mess of bleeding open wounds, cracked or splintered bones or much worse. You feel severe pain just by simply moving around.



When you are beaten and have 2 or fewer Exhaustion, you gain 1 additional level of Exhaustion that only comes into effect after the combat end and the adrenaline wears off.



\# 16) Grievous Wounds:



Whenever a PC reduced to 0 HP, they roll 2d6 and subtract from the result the number existing Grievous Wound they already have and check the Grievous Wounds table. (Wounds marked with \* can be taken more than once)



|    2d6    | Grievous Wound                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 2 or less | Permanent Wound: You have sustained a serious wound that is most likely permanent. Roll on the Permanent Wounds table and apply the result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|     7     | Deep Wound \*: You have taken a blow that under different circumstances would kill most humanoids.

Upon completing a long rest, and if the character or some helping them succeeds on a Medicine check, the effects from Grievous wounds can be removed. The character can try to fix all Grievous Wound or only some. The DC = 8 + number of Grievous Wound trying to heal.



\*\*Bleeding Condition:\*\* Bleeding creatures cannot regain hit points from spells or abilities. A bleeding creature can only regain hit points by consuming hit dice or completing a long rest.



\*\*Dazed:\*\* If you are concentrating on a spell and become dazed, you lose concentration on that spell and it immediately fails. While dazed, you cannot concentrate on spells.



\# 17) Permanent Wounds:



Permanent Wounds are injuries that were not lethal but left the recipient maimed. They represent a serious impediment that requires creativity to overcome. The effects of a permanent wound are irreversible unless the recipient is targeted with the regenerate spell (or similar magic), upon which 1 permanent wound is removed.



Similar to Grievous Wound, a d6 is rolled to determine the Permanent Wound. When rolling, only the effects marked with \* can be taken more than once. If an effect cannot be taken, the next lower effect is taken.

\# 18) Flanking



Flanked: A creature is flanked if there is an enemy creature on two opposite squares adjacent to the creature. While flanked, all melee attacks against the affected creature receive a +2 bonus.



Surrounded: A creature is surrounded instead of flanked if at least two pairs of hostile creatures independently would flank the creature. All melee attacks gain a +5 bonus against the surrounded creature. This doesn’t stack with the flanked +2.



\# 19) Bonus Action



Anything that can be done with a bonus action can be done with an action as well.



\# 20) Language/Tools



When you create your character, your character gains proficiency in a number of additional languages/tools/vehicles equal to their intelligence bonus.



\# 21) NPC Death Saves



All NPCs gain Death Saving throws, but they auto-fail them. So after 3 turns they will die.



\# 22) Cleave Damage:



If damage done to a creature exceeds its hitpoints, the attack can continue, dealing the remaining damage to a creature next to it.



If the attack does slashing damage, the extra damage can be given to a creature within 5ft of the original target, either to the left or right.



If the attack does piercing damage, the extra damage can be given to a creature 5ft behind the original target.



If the attack does bludgeoning damage, the extra damage can be given to a creature within 5ft of the original target, either to the left or right.



\# 23) Hide:



Hide for the purpose of gaining ADV on an attack: you need to break LOS and do a Stealth Check against the Perception of a specific enemy you want to gain ADV against.



Hide for general concealment: You need to break LOS and do a Stealth Check against all the enemies passive Perception.



\# 24) High/Low Ground + Cover



Cover:



Half-Cover: blocks at least ½ of its body.  Target gains +2 AC and +2 to Dex ST



¾ Cover: blocks at least ¾ of its body. Target gets +5 AC and +5 Dex ST.



Total Cover: target is fully hidden. Target cannot be targeted directly by an attack or spell.



High Ground:



You need to be at least 15 ft above your target to gain High Ground Benefits: you gain +2 to hit the target and you gain +1 level of cover from your target (no cover -> half cover; half cover -> ¾ cover)



Low Ground:



You need to be at least 15 ft below your target. You gain -2 to hit and gain -1 cover from your target.



\# 25) Armour:  

  



When a character has no armour or wears light armour, they gain +5ft movement speed



Medium Armour  +0ft



Heavy Armour -5ft movement speed



\# 26) \*\*Development Activities\*\*



The PCs can engage in long-term activities that can build their character in different ways. These development activities happen during rests or downtime.



A short rest (8 hours) includes 2 hours of light activity or 1 Development Activity action (DAA).



A long rest (3 days) includes 3 sets of 2 hour downtime or 3 DAA.



There are 2 major types of activities that a PC can do: Tasks and Projects.



Tasks are generally simpler in nature, such as crafting potions, or teaching another PC a skill that the player is already proficient in.



Projects are long-term endeavors for the PC during which they actively learn something new.



A PC can have a 1 Project active they work through at a time. If a PC starts a new Project before the first one is completed, they lose all progress made in the first Project.



However, Tasks can be done in place of the Project and do not interrupt the progression. 



In order to keep it simple, each activity requires a number of DAA to be completed.



For example: To take the “Learn a new language” Project, a player needs to be in possession or have access to texts, books or people willing to teach them that language and it will require DAA.



Also, PC can perform some Tasks for NPCs, earning gold by doing it.



\# List of Tasks:



\## 1) Teach someone a proficiency:



\### Cost:



1 DAA



\### Requirements:



\- You need to be Proficient in whatever you teach them.

\- Depending on what you are teaching, you might need other materials as well, such as weapons, armors, tools etc, one for you and one for the one you teach.



\## 2) Crafting a Potion or Poison



\### Cost:



1 DAA



\### Requirement:



\- Knowing the recipe of the Potion / Poison

\- Having either the Alchemist Kit or the Poisoner Kit and being proficient in it

\- Having the required Ingredients



\### The Crafting Process



Crafting must be performed over 1 uninterrupted DAA. When an attempt at crafting is initiated, all ingredients are immediately consumed. Interruptions to the process result in automatic failure.



Alchemical items of common and uncommon rarity can be crafted in the field - all you need are the necessary ingredients and access to the correct tools. More potent creation (rare and above) leave little room for distractions or error and require a safe workspace environment such as a private room at an inn. You can attempt to craft rare and above potions in the field, but make the check with disadvantage.



At the end of the DAA, make one of the following checks, depends on what you are doing:



Alchemist's Supplies modifier: proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier



Herbalism Kit: proficiency bonus + Intelligence OR Wisdom modifier



Poisoner's Kit: proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier



Note: while the Poisoner's Kit can obviously craft poisons, the Herbalist kit and Alchemist Supplies aren't as obvious, as they both produce beneficial potions.



Generally speaking, potions that mimic the effect of a Arcane spell are made by Alchemists, those that mimic the effect of a Nature spell are made by herbalists. Herbalists tend to craft more straight-forward potions, while Alchemists craft ones with more complicated effects. Each recipe will note who can make them.



\## 3) Gathering Flora



\### Cost



1 DAA



\### Requirements



\- possession of a Herbalist Kit

\- proficiency in the Herbalist Kit is not required, however, if a PC is proficient in it, they make the Nature Check with advantage to find plants



\### The Gathering Process



While traveling or when using a DAA to look for plants, you make a Nature check to locate, identify and harvest local flora. The DC to find the plant depends on the biome you are in as well as the rarity of the reagent and the rarity of plant itself. (info in the Plant Compendium)



On a success, you harvest 1 ingredient from that plant, enough to be used as 1 reagent or 1 dose of the plants effect. On a critical success, you harvest 1d4+1 ingredients.



\## 4) Weapon Maintenance:



\### Cost



1 DAA



\### Requirements



Smith’s tools or Tinker’s tools, depending on the weapon type.



\### Description:



Proper maintenance prevents weapon decay and might grant a temporary bonus to the next battle due to improved weapon condition.



\### Effects:



Make the weapons less likely to break (it can happen on nat 1s)



Increase damage for done for the first 2 attacks.



\## 5) Armour Maintenance:



\### Cost:



1 DAA



\### Requirement



Proficiency in Smith's Tools or Leatherworker's Tools (depending on the armour)



\### Description:



Improve the durability of personal or a party member's armor, providing temporary enhancements.



\### Effects:



Receive half damage from the next non-magical attack that hits you.



\# List of Projects:



\## 1) Gain proficiency (anything except skills):



\### Cost:



30 DAA



\- If alone: 1 tick for each downtime action spent practicing



\-  If trained by a character that has that proficiency: 2 ticks for each downtime actions spent practicing



\- If trained by a master trainer: 3 ticks for each downtime actions spent practicing



\### Requirements:



\- The weapon/tool/armour the player wants to be proficient in



\## 2) Learn a language:



\### Cost:



60 DAA



\### Downtime Actions:



\- Cannot be done with no materials



\- Access to text and books in that language: 1 tick per downtime action spent practicing



\- Access to a character that speaks the language: 2 ticks per downtime activity



\- Access to a proper teacher: 3 ticks per downtime activity



\## 3) Repairing an item



\### Downtime Actions:



Depends on the state of the item



\- 1 tick per activity



\### Requirements:



\- The item you want to repair



\- Proficiency with that item



\- Proficiency with tools, type of tool depends on the item



\### Example:



You find a rusted shield in a ruined temple. It has been there for decades or more. In order to repair it, you need to be proficient with the shield and with smiths tools.



\## 4) Train an Animal Companion:



\### Cost:



50 DAA



\### Description:



Spend time with an animal companion, teach them to do more complex tasks or better assist in combat.



This can be certain combat skills (such as Charge) or the ability to understand better what you require of them (teaching them how to act in public spaces or certain small tasks they can do in social situations, this is open to discussion and depends on your creativity).



A companion can keep learning new stuff, but the duration will increase with each new skill acquired.



\## 5)Gain a skill proficiency:



\### Cost:



50 DAA



Cannot be done with no materials



\- Access to a character that is proficient in that skill: 1 ticks per downtime activity



\- Access to a proper teacher: 2 ticks per downtime activity



After you have gained a skill proficiency in this way, you can continue to get more, they will require more and more DAA.



\# 27) Attunement 

Attunement is eliminated from the game. Instead, similar to an RPG, players have item slots where can put items. (Thanks BG3). The slots are as follows: Helmet, Shoulders, Torso, Gloves, Belt, Pants, Boots, Jewelry x3 (any type of jewelry fits here, amulet, rings, earrings, etc). Each item found will fit in one of those categories (or if unclear, DM will make a ruling). Beyond this, weapons fit in the main hand/ off hand/ 2h types and they also do not use attunement.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

Mr. Laguna Loire had brought his daughter Ellone to A Day Care the first Year they were living in the duchuesnèy. The First time She was staying with A nurse was in Winhill, where they lived before. A lady living in the next door was nice enough to have an eye on Young Ellone by the time she was only in the Kinder Garden Age. Blonde hair and Blue eyes he reminded himself, cat owner, close to being middle aged and Young by heart, her name was Brigitte.
Now-a-days it was a little bit different because moving to Dollet had changed their life surroundings. The new apartment where they stayed was A working relation commodity, which meant they had An upkeep paying for A room until they would decide to move back to Winhill. Of course that Time was close enough, but Mr. Laguna did receive A contract moving to Dollet for two plus Years. This Time it had been different, because his freelance had brought him such attention, that A local firm wanted him to receive the Apartment, which was based on A leasing. Brigitte was still looking after their House during their working period.
Ellone had aged a few Years since that day and the second Year come by, she already attended to A class in A minor school. After the day was over she might stay in the Montessor doing home work, because her Father had to spend working hours in the evening from time to time so, that she needn’t to spend time alone by herself at the apartment. Usually after the class had dismissed, Ellone walked by the school yard, which was paved, spacious and cornered from the street in such a way it had an intimate airspace apart from the city atmosphere.
Her schooling semester as A student had begun like a wonder. She was enjoying her daily schedule and it made her feel important carrying all the subject books around the classes and the way home. She would come here more often as the time passed, because after the first semester Ellone would attend to A second semester and so on until she was schooled at least nine Years from now on. She would take biology next Year in addition to what she was studying at the moment in the Montessor. Sun was shining brightly and she couldn’t help but smile to herself. The seven Year old daughter was looking pretty today.
The day before they had been playing around in the school yard with a group of pupils. One of their favorite time passing habitè was skipping rope and the girls had a jargon drawn in the ground with A chalk stick, such way it had a few square tiles. A few of them knew how to move from square to square at the rope skipping exercise and they had been practicing dexterity before the class. Laguna had brought Ellone a triangle bread, which he had prepared for his daughter at home before leaving for work. His schedule was convenient enough, that from time to time he would be working a couple hours later than, that Ellone’s first class began in the morning.
Now Ellone was soon done with her homework her teacher had given their class, and to tell the truth She had learned A new skill. It was about the basic calculus, into which she was adapting very quickly. Afterwards A Day Care lady at the Montessor let the children eat their lunch-boxes and if they had the time and A spirit for it, also play with the table-boxes. Dolettian weather had a sense of An Ocean to it, making the air feel clean and the sky look blue, having a relatively close margin to coming intact with the surrounding objects like playing-yard instruments and trees growing around the town. The season wasn’t heated this time of the Year, being close to October, though it wasn't too dark like it would be in A November semester. Kids needed jackets and more soon enough caps as well as shoes, such that kept the head warm and the socks dry. In September the weather became rainy, and being close to the sea, an occlusion frontier closing up from the water bank made it rain vividly. Not wild but still, such rainy weather kept watering the streets the whole of the Fall, dripping on the window sill where The smart girl performed mathematics in focus.

PS

Mr. Laguna Loire was in his corridor at a desk enreadying a theoretical case about A justicé, when it occured to him A philosophical debate he had learned about in the Wikipedia. By A search engine result to the key words “Mircea+Eliade” he had googled an article, which was written in the encyclopedia with an open source code, meaning that all the people had access, making it available to edit any article that wasn’t already in there. How much senseit  had occured him back then, for that had been more than eight years earlier, still he could remember the detail: “ A myth about An eternal returning”.
According to Eliade he had learned about A refrectorial fact relevant to his scientific work, that all the mythological corpuses in the world had a similar theme, which had produced a motive attraction about a hero, who returned to his people after a long period of time. Then according to the structuralist approach Mr. Eliade had formed an argument about how the Human kind was alike to having been tossed to the Earth. By the Time he hadn’t been able to identify the Schooling dogmas, that Eliade did envision with his results according to the internet source, but now it had become important to Laguna ten years after, because he understood it was about A culture ecology paradigm. It made a lot of sense in the contrast of the Law, because it was one of the most natural philosophical schooling dogmas. For example Pierrè Bordieux would have an appreciation towards such a philosophical semantic, because it did explain an existence in a structure that varied around the world. Like why did the animals relate to each other they do in A human opinion?
Not just Foucault, but the Darwin too. Anyway… Today Mr. Loire had noticed how Copper had slowly adapted into the Working in A context of The rural and feodal cultural Age, because of repairing bodies associated with building and preparing work. To assume that An epigenetic motive may become a dilemma, had as well a religious sense to what had crossed Mr. Loires mind that morning, him embarking the triangle bread to the girl school yard, because in a logical semantic manner it would have to be termed as A God treating human beings as if like they were dolls.
That is a reason why in theory A harm towards A Body will generalize until it becomes a matter of A common Court Justice, if not also A fraud attached into the 3D-corpus of a digital body. For example A ‘typo’ is a petty harbing, which as A focus of A performance may be terminized as A fraud, because the object will end up into An ongoing circle having to repair His/Her grammar over again on A computer, which had A short-circuit.
When it comes to A God Divine, Laguna thought that in the Middle Age A Priecher Man called Urbanus XlV had surmised An Ecumeny in his dogma about A Divine Justification, meaning that the God didn’t want humans to suffer, but A broken conduit in the social culture like A Media, was hence of A village community’s outsiders fault. The moment when A typo causes harm as well as An Intel safety risk, A theft endirects the Freedom of the Speech Act as well as An individual procured User Account lingual corpus, meaning the body of a phrase. According to A precase of A law in such A situation, when the body of a phrase needs to be repaired on a machina, leads back due to A physical manifestation into the copper component and Serve A Copper Law.

A Wander lust had filled the Heart traveling between different places like Esthar, Dollet and Winhill. Finding and staying in An interesting and enjoyable place was the topmost of Laguna's feelings he had learned to know during his life time. Sharing this with Ellone was fabulous, and not just like A simple minded, conversational thing, to traverse about and chit chat. That was One Thing how the two of them were different, because his daughter wasn’t like that by nature. As her Father he had it surmised from now and then if he even wanted to be thinking about the subject of A change of the surroundings. To come to think about A fact that they had such A wonderful opportunity to have accepted the Relation Apartment in A new place soothed his nerves and silenced his tremending heart. He would feel the anxiety no more, which had earlier sneaked quietly into the subconsciousness, making A Man act like he had done before. He was proud of Ellone, who could sense this by heart, and such was her persona as a matter of a fact, that She might see what had made her Father the way he became by the time, and so it may have passed, thanks to A loveable companion.

Incite: “More over what is so amazing simply put, is the fact that Dollet situated on the coast line next to the ocean, which enabled A massive Port. It has made the town grow during the seasons big enough to become a street smart kind image and endorse A population. A myriad of harbour workers attended to A job with just enough salary to stay in the schedule to wharfing, A routine where Men stuffed huge containers up The Port into The Docked Ship. An organisation building counted everything up making money and endorsing the working class not to lose Time. During the work the Men have to stay in a highly alerted focus, because even A small mistake may lead to A disaster, while A string of iron or A tight rope pulled A Ready Container up in the air. Everything became A catastrophe if A Port Container door opened in the Middle of a somping, so the workers need An actual refocus ‘cause it is their life that mattered, alike to how the Laguna's A family oriented way of life. A single food ecology of one family housing doesn’t include making money, because that’s the responsibility of the Port Contortionist, meaning the people in A household included just A bread as A salary in addition to a clock card for A small family just like A drum dove.”

A myth about a big money faded away living in the Dollet Port, and thinking about what affordable food was on the wares, made the life more interesting, always learning how to cook dishes. Such A simple way of life kept the two of them healthy, while boiling A bank of water - and adding just the right amount of ingredients drove Away the Bella Donna. It was A wicked little thief fleeing like “A crabs on sands”, back into the ocean where it had came from. Seemingly Laguna and Ellone had everything, which was needed in order to make A living in A coastal town. Such way was their drum dowing in the vicinity of the historical magazine, spending A firm time at the other edges of the Duchy, managing A behavioral life in A sense, which was meaningful for them both.

“But how about our home in Winhill,” Ellone did ask her Father eating her breakfast before going to the school in the morning, at their residue in The near of the Port. She was having cereals, which as An import were one of the good sides living in such an ecology. Her favourite diet while attending to the first grade was to buy A cheap bag of cereals and have them twice a day, in the morning with milk, and in the evening with yogurt. “Is Brigittè keeping A good care of it while we're away?”
“Brigittè has too much space to be looking after if she had to live in two houses at the same time. Though She did promise to help if such A time would suddenly come to happen that we couldn't make it there in A time soon enough.” Laguna was drinking a hot cup of coffee, which he liked from time to time, even though it was a bit expensive. Now he was happy to be having a little portion of a left over sortment bean, because it was chilly outside during the pedestry walking to the work. The fact that it was, he may not be able to stay in A Nautilus table for working every time, due to it being costful to pay up every time, when he needed a salary. “Oh dear!”
“What now, Father, what's up,” Ellone raised her eyes from her cereal in a methodical and a surprised way, suddenly her Father having a minor level status ailment. “Is something wrong?” She was looking towards him and as soon as she could perceive he was alright she went on. “Has anyone still answered to the notice?”
Together they had written A notice including pictures, which they had photographed before the departure from Winhill and left it in A web service “www.airbnb.co” so, that it would become easier for Brigitte not to get tired watching the Loire household during their stay in Dollet. “It's just that I happened to forget if this worldly bean was An arabic one or An african type my dear”, Laguna answered smiling to her and making a notice in the corner of his eye out of the window, which opened to A street view leading into the Port of Dollet. “It might have suddenly become the arabic kind having it with you, because you're such a sweet heart, and did You know that A cafe arabica’s got An éssence to it, while A canefora is more about A flavor”. Outside you couldn't differ a lot this time of the year, early in the morning, but you could tell the weather was lousy. Luckily enough it wasn’t raining heavily at least not just yet. “I have to check it up as soon when I get to the office. Are you aware that it might start snowing already in A few weeks time Ellone, if the temperature reaches zero degrees celcius? Didn't they teach You that in the School Dear.”

Incite: Dollet was A fascinating place to be living, because of its infrastructure, which was tacitly built into the presence of A magazine house way back. The sizeable amount of resources were harvested over there earlier by the time, when A Duchy was being found for the first time. A history of A two hundred Years told the story of how locals had farmed the land which had been covered under a forest until the settlement had feodalized the logosphere. Around that time period the Port became intact with the infrastructure, even though now-a-days the Old magazine building had vanished due to A burning. The duchuesnèy decided not to rebuild the magazine house, because they would have came up with A plan to fortify the fragment with A modern architecture more suitable for A population, having a choice in between business or pleasure. This way the growing town might build up tourism not just as A sizeable Port to the Sea, but An attraction for the foreigners, who wished to travel enroute to the ocean.
The Port was growing in A tense speed with A motivated generation, who were raised in the near of the vicinity next to the rurality, wharfing a big load capacity carriers. From time to time A contractor would bring A resourceful amount of living standards to the Port and such way the magazine house was filled up with food items, which benefitted the farming communion. Dollet prospered, because of working the croft had given A class with a few options A work, having a choice which career to take up coming of Age: The farmhand or A wharfer.
Mr. Laguna was spending time in the croft on a daily basis having a work at the Port Contortionist House, while Ellone went to A School in the district, where the modernized area of the Old magazine was located A hundred years of time before. The Industry had made A Duchuesnèy to grow up into A city scape just how one might have perceived it them self, and leading A family oriented life in such A city, was really A big curiosity for Young Ellone who had made real friends.
An Industry had been booming coming of Age A Duchy beginning to resemble A city more of A town, the site growing in size, and because of the living standard being brought to the magazine house after being counted up in the Port contortion, the Items were fetched by the farmers, who this way became able to build up the city scape. An interesting curiosity in Dollet were the food market halls, which had been adapted by the example of the Mediterranean ecological way-of-life, which sold fresh food on A daily basis right after A skipper had embarked the wharf and sold A load of fish for the marketer vending the wares. The duchuesnèy loved to buy fresh fish and having fetched A food item from their town magazine building, they had A multitude of food on their table, which built up a healthy diet.

- How would You say... Is it seven o'clock?
A therapeut of his had asked him a question, which wasn't in the line. In relation with the times in before, it seemed like if she finally had given up a fully formal act.
- That is an interesting question... Yes, I would say that it is. Six, six to seven o'clock.
What an odd time for A therapy truth to be told.
- May I suggest changing A few premises, because in my opinion it's absurd that a conversation would take place here and now? Mr. Almacy took A chance, and his therapeut gave in. - Tell me if we may have this session at A sigar stair in The studio? As soon as he's decided as well the surrounding place will be shaped differently, this time as A well equipped sound studio.
- Monseigneur Almacy, pardon-me. The lady looks at him pretty careful. She has different clothes on and is wearing A sleeve. It's soothing the nerves.
- Comment c'est-va? Mr. Seifer asked in return looking tranquil. - Merci bocu.
- Un question ála quriosite. Situations change.
- Mademoiselle, voudrais-tu une monster? Vou les vou un éclair petit. Mr. Almacy offered her a sweet bun from a casket, which laid on the table. - Madame Epicnáras?
- Ouie au sonté. Merci mons Seifer. She wasn't thinking about A role for a therapist now that she actually felt a bit hungry. The dough was tasty like it was made in an ancient church. - Três bien!
While She was eating the door would open and in walked Miss Brigitte dressed in a gypsy fashioned style of A mod, which made her look rock. - Ábientôut! She said to the both of them looking delightful.
They both welcomed her to sit on the Sigar Porch with them and She walked around the table and sat down next to Mr. Seifer on his right side. - Un phantàsma realite par avôt? She would add soon making him smile.
- Ouie çava-jaime, mon cheri Brigittè. Now we just have to wait for Mr. Leonhart to join us in order to start the audition, Mr. Almacy told them, which they would nod silently and then they waited for it as long as it would take for him to wake up from the life he was living at the moment.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

*   **Accommodation:** ~$350 (average $27/night). This was a mix of a super basic guesthouse room on Vis (€35), an Airbnb room in Vela Luka, Korčula (€30), and some *very* cheap apartments found via local signs on Lastovo (€20-25). I wasn't picky.
*   **Food & Drinks:** ~$220. My secret? Cooking breakfast and most lunches (hello, local markets! 🍅), and enjoying simple, incredible seafood or a pizza for dinner. Peka for one night was a splurge!
*   **Ferries & Buses:** ~$90. Mostly Jadrolinija ferries between Split, Vis, Lastovo, Korčula, and back to the mainland. Booking in advance for longer routes saved a few bucks.
*   **Activities & Misc:** ~$27 (mostly a scooter rental for one day on Vis, and a couple of beers by the sea).

**What Actually Worked (and Where I Went):**

*   **Vis Island:** This place feels like stepping back in time. Rented a scooter for a day (€25) to explore Stiniva beach (go early!) and Komiža town. Ate the freshest grilled fish from a konoba in Kut for about €15. *Unpopular opinion:* Skip Blue Cave tours and find your own swimming coves.
*   **Lastovo Archipelago:** This was my absolute favorite. Wild, undeveloped, and blissfully quiet. Stayed in Pasadur. Hiked to the lighthouse. The clearest water I've ever seen. If you want true escape, this is it. It's a bit harder to get to, which keeps the crowds away.
*   **Korčula (western side):** Instead of Korčula Town, I based myself in Vela Luka. Rented a cheap bike (€5/day) and cycled to small, quiet coves. Tried some excellent local wine directly from a vineyard just outside town for a fraction of what you'd pay in the main tourist hubs.

**Real Talk: Here's What Sucked (and What I Learned)**

> Ferry schedules on smaller islands can be tricky. I had one ferry to Lastovo delayed by 3 hours. Pack a book, snacks, and patience. Connectivity can also be spotty, which was a blessing and a curse. Don't expect strong Wi-Fi everywhere.

I also initially packed way too much. Hauling a heavy suitcase between ferries and up winding village paths was a workout I didn't sign up for. **Pro tip:** Pack light! A small backpack is all you need.

The best meal I had wasn't a fancy restaurant. It was fresh bread, local cheese, and olives bought from a tiny market stall in Vis, eaten by the sea at sunset. Cost me about €7 and was pure magic. ✨

So, is it possible to have an incredible, authentic Croatian adventure without breaking the bank? Absolutely. It takes a bit more planning and a willingness to step off the beaten path, but the rewards are huge.

We text pretty much every day. She's funny, flirty, asks about my day, sends pics of her food, dumb memes, all that. So it doesn't feel dead or one-sided. But the only time she actually tries to see me is 10pm or later.

First time she asked, she said she was ""near my place"" and wanted to ""stop by"" after she was done out. I said nah because it felt kinda last minute and I was already home. She was like ""lol ok"" and then kept texting like nothing.

A few days later she did it again. Same vibe: ""I'm free now if you wanna hang."" I suggested we grab coffee the next day instead, something normal, daytime. She said ""maybe"" and then just never followed up. Then last night she hit me with ""come over?"" at like 11:40pm. I didn't reply until the morning and she sent a smiley like it was cute or something.

I get it, people are busy, and I'm not clutching pearls about sex. I'm a guy, I have a sex drive. But I'm not trying to start something where I'm basically the late night option when she's bored or tipsy. I want someone who actually makes a plan and wants to see me in daylight too, not just ""pull up"" texts when it's convenient.

The problem is I also don't want to sound bitter or like I'm accusing her of being shady after only a few weeks. I like her. I just don't like this pattern.

How do I say this without making it weird? What's the best way to set the boundary (no late-night drop-ins) and also figure out if she's actually interested in dating vs just wanting convenience?

Hi fellow candlemakers! 

I made some candles this past winter and loved the results but want to improve to make more candles of a better quality.

I created all my own scents using canola oil (I know, it was all I had and figured it was worth a shot) and the infused the different scents I wanted to make into the oil, then adding it to the melted wax. While that worked alright, I went to make a more intense scent and use a different, more neutral oil. 

I steeped the tea bags in warm oil on the stove but used our Levo machine to dry and infuse the coffee and pine. 

Long story short, looking for recommendations on what oil to use for a better result!

1r81xkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wwe2k26/comments/1r81xkx/want_to_seek_ultimate_truth/,want to seek ultimate truth ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.
