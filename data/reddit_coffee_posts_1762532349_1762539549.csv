Let us all pray she can have this life she dreamed of.,"The screen door slammed behind Britney as she stepped out onto the porch of her double-wide, a cold Red Bull in one hand and a cigarette already dangling from her lips. The can hissed open with that perfect sound, the little burst of energy she swore kept her soul humming.

She took a drag and exhaled slow, watching the smoke curl into the thick Louisiana air. Her hair was a tangled, sun-bleached masterpiece of extensions and it was piled on top of her head with a scrunchie she’d had since the “…Baby One More Time” days. Folks were always trying to mess with it, but she hated that. “Don’t touch my damn hair,” she’d say. 

Inside, her boys were playing video games way too loud, shouting about high scores and zombie attacks. Britney rolled her eyes, tapping ash off her cigarette. Must be nice, she thought, sitting around playing games all day while their mama used to work till her knees gave out in high heels. It stung sometimes. They’d never know what it felt like to have the whole world pulling at you till you forgot who you were.

She thought about dinner and smirked. She’d never touch canned veggies again, not after all those years of people handing her “healthy” food like it was some kind of prize. 

She cracked open her second Red Bull and smiled to herself anyway. The world had tried to polish her up, tell her how to act, what to say, how to look. They’d even tried to make her sit still, make her sit in that chair like some kind of doll that only moved when told to. But not anymore. Nobody was ever gonna force her to sit in a chair again.

She stubbed out her cigarette, stood up, and let the rhythm in her bones take over. She turned on Justin Bieber and she started to sway, slow at first, then with that spark that never really left her.
“I just gotta move my feet,” she whispered, half laughing. “Always have, always will.”

Out here in her trailer, in her little patch of nowhere,  she was just Britney Jean again. A mama, a country girl, and a woman who loved her smokes, her freedom, her Red Bull, and her wild, untamed hair

And as the night settled in, she grinned to herself, lifting her chin toward the stars.
They’d taken plenty from her before, but not anymore.
Not her dancing.
Not her peace.

Tw: poop horror story.,"This is embarrassing but I’m honestly worried. I don’t think I’ve had a bowl movement in like a week. 2mo ago when I asked the midwife about bad constipation and boating she seemed unconcerned and said to take Colace or Dulcolax but there’s so many different options idk what to choose.

TMI: 3x now I’ve had like the biggest bm of my life, and the last one, about a week ago was the worst. I was sitting in the toilet for like 30min trying to go and it was literally just stuck there. Pushing hurt but it wouldn’t budge, it felt like the nerves to my legs were being cut off. I was honestly scared and thought I might have to go to the hospital or something. I even tried manually removing it to no avail. I had heard horror stories like this before but never thought it would be me 🥲🥲🥲. Eventually it did come out and my ass hurt for like 2days. I feel like I got a preview of birth. 

It’s now been like a week and I only had one very small, effortfull movement. My whole abdomen feels so bloated and stiff at times and even though I’ve felt like I’ve had to go plenty of times nothing happens. Even coffee, spicy foods, and walking 10mi in a day have not helped. I’m scared I could have a blockage or something honestly and I’m gonna bring it up at my next appointment but my clinic always tells me everything is normal 🙄.

1or1qfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1or1qfq/torn/,Torn,"I've decided to get myself a Mac sometime this month.  
I’ve narrowed it down to either a **Mac mini** or a **MacBook Pro**, both with the M4 chip and at least 16 GB of memory.

I’m leaning toward the Mac mini because of its small form factor, tidy design, and portability. It’s easy to move around, and since I use an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse 99% of the time with my current laptop, it would fit perfectly into my setup.

That being said, the reason why I even started to think about getting a Mac was because I was was handed down an old  2015 Macbook Air, and it blew my mind how well a 10 year old laptop could preform that and the screen felt to comfortable to use. Because of that experience I started to use the Macbook away from my desk and more often around the house, at coffee shops, or even in the park. 

In the end, I know I want to own a Mac; I’m just not sure whether to go with the Mac mini or the MacBook Pro and I would like to hear your experience.  
  
Some context on what I currently use my laptop for. I mainly do DevOps and development work, and I also play some games on it from time to time.

The land of croissants, captivating art, and the gentle clinking of wine glasses. It’s a country that promises romance and refinement. But let's be honest: for many travelers, it also comes with a side of anxiety. The fear of committing a cultural *faux pas* is real. You've heard the stories—the stoic waiters, the icy glares in shops, the infamous ""rude French"" stereotype.

But what if I told you that 90% of those negative interactions are completely avoidable? It's not about the French being rude; it's about a different, and very specific, set of social rules. By understanding the ""why"" behind their customs, you can flip the script, turning potential awkwardness into warm, memorable exchanges.

So, you're wondering **what to not do when in France?** You've come to the right place. This isn't a list to scare you, but a secret weapon to help you connect with the culture, earn some respect, and travel like a truly savvy globetrotter.

Here are 11 things you should never do when in France.

---

### 1. Never Enter a Shop or Restaurant Without ""Bonjour""

This is, without exaggeration, the golden rule. It's the key that unlocks everything.

*   **The Mistake:** Walking into a boulangerie, a boutique, or even an elevator and immediately launching into your request in English.
*   **The ""Why"":** In France, a greeting is not optional pleasantries; it’s a fundamental acknowledgment of the other person's existence and presence. Skipping it is the social equivalent of barging into someone's home without knocking. It's seen as incredibly rude and dismissive.
*   **The Fix:** Make eye contact, offer a slight smile, and say, ""**Bonjour, monsieur/madame**"" (Hello, sir/madam). When you leave, always say, ""**Au revoir. Bonne journée!**"" (Goodbye. Have a good day!). Just this simple exchange will change the entire dynamic of your interaction.

### 2. Don't Speak at Full Volume in Public Spaces

Americans, in particular, are often accustomed to a louder public volume. In France, less is more.

*   **The Mistake:** Having a loud conversation on the Metro, laughing boisterously in a quiet restaurant, or talking across a cafe table.
*   **The ""Why"":** The French value discretion and privacy. Being loud in public draws unwanted attention and is often perceived as attention-seeking and lacking refinement. Public space is shared, and you're expected to respect its collective tranquility.
*   **The Fix:** Keep your voice down. Observe the volume level of those around you and match it. You'll blend in instantly.

### 3. Don't Put Your Bread on the Dinner Plate

This is a classic dining mistake that's surprisingly common.

*   **The Mistake:** When the breadbasket arrives, placing your piece of *pain* directly on your dinner plate next to your main course.
*   **The ""Why"":** The bread has its own place. The dinner plate is for the food served by the restaurant. The tablecloth (or a dedicated bread plate if one is provided) is where bread belongs.
*   **The Fix:** Place your bread directly on the table, to the top-left of your main plate. Tear it—don't cut it with a knife—and use it to mop up sauce (a practice called *saucer*), but do it delicately.

### 4. Don't Order a Cappuccino or a Latte After Dinner

If you want to drink coffee like a local, you need to know the rules of the game.

*   **The Mistake:** After a lovely dinner, ordering a *café crème* (the French equivalent of a latte) or a *cappuccino*.
*   **The ""Why"":** In France, coffee with lots of milk (*café crème*, *café au lait*, *cappuccino*) is considered a breakfast or morning drink. Ordering it after a meal is seen as strange and unpalatable to the French stomach. Plus, it's thought to hinder digestion.
*   **The Fix:** After lunch or dinner, if you want coffee, order an *espresso* (or simply a ""*café*""). It's small, strong, and designed to be sipped after a meal to aid digestion.

### 5. Don't Ask for Substitutions or Customizations

The chef is an artist, not a short-order cook.

*   **The Mistake:** Asking to hold the sauce, swap the frites for a salad, or make other major alterations to a dish on the menu.
*   **The ""Why"":** French cuisine is revered and highly structured. Dishes are created with a specific balance of flavors and textures in mind. Asking for changes implies you know better than the chef and is considered disrespectful to their craft.
*   **The Fix:** Order what’s on the menu. If you have a genuine allergy, by all means, explain it (**""Je suis allergique aux noix""** - ""I am allergic to nuts""). But for preference, try to be flexible and embrace the dish as it was intended.

### 6. Don't Assume You Can Split the Bill Easily

The concept of ""going Dutch"" isn't the default, especially in smaller groups.

*   **The Mistake:** At the end of a meal with a friend, expecting the waiter to split the bill card-by-card or itemize everything for each person.
*   **The ""Why"":** Traditionally, one person pays the entire bill. The idea is to take turns treating each other over time. It’s less transactional and more about the gesture of hospitality. From a practical standpoint, many smaller cafes and restaurants are simply not equipped with the software to easily split a check multiple ways.
*   **The Fix:** If you're with one or two friends, it's easiest for one person to pay the whole bill and the others pay them back in cash. In larger tourist groups, some places are more flexible, but it's always polite to ask beforehand if splitting is possible: ""**Est-ce qu'on peut additionner séparément?**""

### 7. Don't Touch the Merchandise Without Asking

Shopping in France can feel a bit more formal than what you might be used to.

*   **The Mistake:** Walking into a boutique, picking up a scarf, unfolding a shirt, or generally manhandling the products without permission.
*   **The ""Why"":** In smaller, more curated shops (especially clothing or accessories), items are treated with care. The shopkeeper is the guardian of these things. Touching first is seen as presumptuous.
*   **The Fix:** Greet the staff with a polite **""Bonjour""**. Let them approach you. If you're interested in something, make eye contact and ask, ""**Ça m'intéresse, est-ce que je peux regarder?**"" (I'm interested, may I look?). In larger department stores or chains, this rule is much more relaxed, but when in doubt, be respectful.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20to%20not%20do%20when%20in%20France%3F)

### 8. Don't Launch into English Without a French Attempt

Effort is everything. Even a terrible attempt is better than none.

*   **The Mistake:** Walking up to a Parisian and immediately asking, ""Where is the Louvre?""
*   **The ""Why"":** France is proud of its language. Assuming everyone should speak English can come across as arrogant. The immediate switch to English without a preamble often puts people on the defensive.
*   **The Fix:** Always start with the magic words: ""**Bonjour, excusez-moi de vous déranger. Parlez-vous anglais?**"" (Hello, excuse me for disturbing you. Do you speak English?). This simple gesture of respect shows you're on their turf and you value their language. You'll find people are far more willing and helpful afterward.

### 9. Don't Over-Tip

This is a huge point of confusion, especially for American visitors.

*   **The Mistake:** Leaving a 20% tip on your credit card slip.
*   **The ""Why"":** By law, a 15% service charge (*service compris*) is already included in your bill in French restaurants and cafes. Waiters are salaried employees with benefits, not dependent on tips to make a living wage like in the US.
*   **The Fix:** If the service was good, you can leave a small extra amount in cash. Rounding up to the nearest euro is common for a coffee. For a great meal, leaving 5-10% in cash is a generous and appreciated compliment to the server, but it is not expected.

### 10. Don't Smile at Strangers

A friendly smile can sometimes have an unintended meaning.

*   **The Mistake:** Walking down the street and beaming a big, toothy smile at every person you make eye contact with.
*   **The ""Why"":** In American culture, a smile is a general, friendly gesture. In France, it's often more intimate and reserved for people you know or situations where you're genuinely sharing a moment of amusement or connection. A random, broad smile from a stranger can be perceived as insincere, or in some cases, as an invitation or a flirtation.
*   **The Fix:** A polite, neutral expression is the norm. A small, subtle smile is fine, but the wide, toothy grin is best reserved for your actual interactions.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20to%20not%20do%20when%20in%20France%3F)

### 11. Don't Rush Your Meal

Meals are an event, not a refueling stop.

*   **The Mistake:** Trying to get in and out of a restaurant in under 45 minutes, waving down the waiter for the check immediately after your last bite.
*   **The ""Why"":** The French cherish the art of the meal. It's a time for conversation, pleasure, and savoring the food and company. Rushing is seen as frantic and a sign that you didn't enjoy the experience.
*   **The Fix:** Relax. Settle in. Expect a meal to take a minimum of 90 minutes to two hours. The waiter will not bring you the check until you ask for it. When you are ready, catch their eye and say, ""**L'addition, s'il vous plaît.**"" Enjoy the pace. It’s one of the greatest luxuries of French culture.

---

### The Real Secret to France

At its core, navigating French culture boils down to one simple concept: **respect**. Respect for their language, their food, their traditions, and their personal space. It's not about being overly formal or stuffy; it's about acknowledging that you are a guest in a culture with deep roots.

Armed with these tips, you're no longer just a tourist. You're a thoughtful traveler. Go forth, savor every bite of that cheese, drink that glass of wine, and say your ""*bonjours*"" and ""*au revoirs*"" with confidence. The France you've always dreamed of is waiting for you.

i needed his advice on a situation and i asked him to grab coffee and he picked up and dropped me off listened to me and didn’t tell anyone we hung out . mason also kept asking updates about my family since that’s what was upsetting me and that’s what i wanted to talk to him about . then i messed up because and did something i shouldn’t have and messaged him a week later asking if he wanted to go to the beach and he wad like yeah let’s go later tonight and we made plans and he picked me up made comments about how i should stop trying to plan stuff and let him handle things opened doors for me and payed for my food. also said i looked good indirectly though.  i told myself that was the final hangout with him and he has a really big exam coming up end of november so he was telling me he’s gonna see my next after my exam . even then in my head i was like noo im not about to hang out with him ever again i just wanted one final hang out with him . 

later found that one of our female coworkers asked to hang out with him and he said no , when i asked him why he didn’t hangout w her he said “why would i do that” ? thay made no sense to me but then he also told me he’s really busy because of his exams and he hasn’t been hanging out w anyone and only made time for me . when i was hanging out with him at the beach i got upset about all of our coworkers saying we’re dating and i tell mason we should stop being friends . and he’s like why do u want to do that lets stop caring what people think and keep being friends . and i said we already tried that (when we first started to get allegations of dating we tried to distance our self but it didn’t work lol) . then he goes like fine let’s just like not talk or take lunch at work anymore and like limit our contact but we will stay friends outside of work . 


he doesn’t hang out with his female friends alone outside of work and i don’t hang out w guys either . in between all of us this if i was ever upset at work he would pull me aside and ask me what’s wrong and say he can always read my behaviour or like tease me infront of my coworkers . he would get upset and non verbal when i would bring up another guy but would still jokingly try to set me up with other guys and i would do the same .  he would defend me in front of his best friend and make me lunch . he would randomly tell me im a good person and i have a good personality and and then im caring and stuff .all after he rejected me btw 

so recently he took time off since he needs the whole month to study for his exam and i hadn’t seen him in 2 weeks . i was getting over him and even through all the confusion i was coming to terms with it . he had to come into work once for a training and it was a day i was working and he texted me telling me he was gonna be there but i purposely left early so i didn’t have to see him .

this is the longest we have gone without seeing each other  since we meet . a few days ago i had to see him like no one could cover me at work and i was really upset about having to see him but yah 

when i saw him he was soo happy like he was yelling my name across the hallway and came so close to me and was look you like a women today you changed . just like genuinely flirted with me . i only saw him for 4 hours but he was soo close to me and every interaction  i had with him he was smiling and flirting with me . just like subtly in a teasing way but def flirting i could tell he missed me and im not gonna lie i really really missed him too. i was taking this whole month thay he was off to get over him but he ended up picking up a shift and it just ruined my whole progress of getting over him. i missed him so much and i really really like him and i need to get over him but i just hate that we’re gonna always be friends and i’ll never hate him because it’s not his fault he’s  not into me . i know that aside from romantic feelings we still really care for eachtoher and i don’t keep male friends and he’s the only exception .

it’s been two months since he told me he had no feelings but his actions have shown other wise . i respected his boundaries when he told
me he wasn’t into me but like i hate how he was complimenting me and clearly missed me alot . 


i just hate that he genuinely cares for me and when he told me he didn’t like me i felt like i was crazy and dumb but somethings were soo clear they could not have been mis interpreted any other way , but still for the last two weeks ive been getting over him and coming to terms with just being his friend just for him to miss me this much to a point where he was yelling my name across the hallway ? i know he’s not my man but am i not allowed to be mad .i tried to talk to other guys but honestly he’s the one i want i’ve genuinely never liked someone this much. i was talking to a guy that i could tell that was really into me but i just kept thinking about some dumb thing maosn did while i was on call with the new guy . i ended things with him but i hate that there could be other people that are genuinely interested in you and make effort for you and im still stuck over him . im mad he gets so upset when i bring up another guy which makes no sense to me . i was the one that liked him and hes the one that rejected me you know so why is he so upset that i downloaded a dating app? i started texting less since he took time off and i haven’t texted him since Saturday and he hasn’t texted me. we saw each other monday but like i know if he wanted me he would have just texted me and been more clear with his intentions . i know how men are if they like someone they go and get them but like mason just keeps doing this when im genuinely trying to get over him and even now i would give him a chance 

i am not sure if should talk to him and be like heyy u said u weren’t into me but u haven’t been respecting my boundaries and stuff or distance myself and just stop being friends all together? ",1,1762538816.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1or1lc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1or1lc3/am_i_the_asshole_for_confiscateting_my_bathroom/,"Am I the asshole for ""confiscateting"" my bathroom trash bin?","I, 32 F, have been married to my husband 35M for 4 years now. We have a small business and we both worked 50/50 up until I was pregnant with our child. We both agreed on me staying home after the baby was born to avoid sending our child to daycare and benefit from teaching her ourselves. This information will be needed later. Now, our marriage isn't the problem. We for the most part have an amazing relationship...but my MIL...is questionable. 

Up until I was pregnant with my first child, we were fine. But as soon as I stopped working at the mid stage of my pregnancy to nest and dial my stress down, is where the problem started. My MIL lives in another country so she occasionally comes visit once or twice a year for 2-4 weeks at a time, depending on the time of the year. The time that she came in to visit to ""help me around the house,"" (as she told my husband) during my 2nd trimester, she started acting odd. She started not picking up after herself. Cooking and leaving splatters of food on the backlash, floor and stove along with not washing a single dish. She would leave her shopping bags on the couch and tags from new clothing on the floor. Mind you, I have 2 dogs that shred through anything like clockwork.  Point is, I felt like she was doing it on purpose since I ""didn't work."" I sucked it up and cleaned after her. When she saw that I let it slide, it got worse. Now she would purposely leave coffee mugs in randon places, snack wrappers and crumbs on the couches, a mess in the shower (shampoo bottles in the shower floor and hair everywhere,) her clothes on the floor. But worst of all, she started leaving 💩 stains on the toilet seat (not the bowl, THE SEAT!) and tossing toilet paper with full blown 💩 smeared all over it in the disposal bin FACING UP!!! The odor was FOUL!! At that point I drew the line. I told her to please refrain from tossing used toilet paper in the bin. We have an updated plumbing system along with a Power flushing toilet which will take care of an elephant dump after Thanksgiving dinner!!!! The smiled and said ""oh, sorry. I'm not use to flushing toilet paper."" Mind you, we NEVER had this issue before. 

I continued not letting her get to me and cleaning up after her. The next 3 following days after that incident, she kept doing it daily! At this point I was f&@%*ng sick of it. So, I waited for her to go on her daily NAP...yes NAP while preggrs cleaned after her!!!! I went in to do a daily scrub down of the bathroom, I collected all the paper towels I used to clean in the bin and took it with me and simply tossed it in the dumpster! 😌
When she woke from her nap, she went straight to the bathroom and when she got out she was NOT a happy camper. She asked me where the bin was and I told her, ""oh, I tossed it since it smelled so awful!"" 😊 She was not happy at all! Lol 

When my husband arrived from work, she told my husband that I purposely ""took the bin away from her"" (mind you my husband had no idea what was going on because I didnt tell him. He has enough on his plate with work.)My husband looked at me then looked back at her and told her what she was doing was completely unsanitary, specially since I was pregnant! Ah, yes and since she decided to air out laundry...I took the glorious opportunity to tell my husband how she was mischievously leaving a mess throughout the house to keep me busy. He was FURIOUS to the point that he asked her to pack her things if she was not going to respect our home and his pregnant wife.   She hasn't come to visit ever since.  So THT Fam....am I the petty  asshole? 🤣 ",1,1762538772.0,TwoHotTakes,4,0.67,False

Not sure if caused from blood loss or nicotine use after having blood drawn, low glucose or something. 

Went for a1c/general panel, fasted. They took 3 tubes. 815am.

Get home 20 mins later, creeping headache over the next 2 hours. Feels like brain freeze on my left front. I had coffee at 845, eggs and toast at 11, 200mg advil at 1140. No change, it's 1pm. My head feels so dull. 

Feel kinda weak/bad mood. Sudden thirst, and im slowly drinking water. 

Cant tell what im low in or if it was caused by vaping 1.4mg nicotine (normal for me) as when I do my head hurts worse and subsides, I stopped vaping at 1130.

1or1ixx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1or1ixx/my_boyfriend_25m_keeps_asking_for_sex_in_a_weird/,My boyfriend (25M) keeps asking for sex in a weird way. Should I (25F) stay in the relationship or cut it now itself before it's too late? Help pls,"So I’ve always wanted to meet someone organically as it feels more natural and not rushed. I met this guy and we talked on chat and calls for a bit before actually meeting. We vibed instantly, but also I have a very outgoing and friendly personality so I do talk to everyone easily, but he did seem different and nice from the rest as well so I liked him initially. I’m 25F, he’s 6 months younger.

Then later after a few weeks of talking when we met, each time he bought me flowers. Now the problems start when he asked if I wanna have sex that night, and I said “I don’t have sex with just friends” to give him the hint that he has to ask me out as well (since we had been going out for a 2-3 weeks but hadn’t officially made it clear). That night itself he asked me out (even though it was his plan all along I believe) but in my head, the timing was so dependent on what I had said. Then again that night itself, after asking me out, he asked if I wanna have sex with him, and I said “no, I wanna wait till we’re comfortable” and he said - he’s comfortable so why not, so I said - I wanna take some time, and he just kept asking “why, so I can get more clarity and understanding”, and that felt like a very awkward conversation to have. I told him it was too fast and I wanna wait it out to see if he’s not there just for sex, and he got really really upset and angry. Pre context of this is, he had not gone down on me even once, while he had received alot of bjs and came multiple times, so to me it just seemed unfair to directly rush into sex. Eventually in that conversation I did tell him the above as well more softly so it doesn’t come out rude but it was a very awk convo to have honestly from my end since I’ve never had to have this convo before.

Then, he also seems to think about himself more than he thinks of others, and I am more of a giving person, like I do like to care of the people close to me and just do anything for them to make them happy. But this guy doesn’t seem that and that also bothers me a bit.

One time he asked me to come to a place which would be close to where he’s going, so when he gets free we can have coffee there. Sounds fine, but it was 15 kms away from my house and would have taken me 1 hr to reach just to have coffee with him? And then he had to go somewhere else, so it’s not like we could’ve spent the remaining time together. Just have coffee and leave?? And later he anyway had to come close to my area itself so he could have offered to meet somewhere there but no?

And not even a single time he has offered to pay the bill. Whenever the bill comes, I pay him instantly the split. But in my head I thought - okay we are dating now so we can do 1 place me, 1 place him. I ended up paying in 3 places consecutively and he didn’t pay me back. I didn’t ask thinking he will pay someplace else. I let him pay someplace else and he goes like - btw I got the split from the place we had gone to so can you pay me. And he had ordered wine from Goa (Goa is supposed to be super cheap with alcohol) and we had thought we can have it together but we hadnt opened it yet. So he was asking me the split of all (which would have been less than what he owed me for the 3 places) so he could’ve left the asking for money thing also if he wanted to since he owed me for a while and I didn’t ask. But he chose to ask, so I also balanced out mine and it turned out to be equal. But he could’ve done it mentally that oh I’ve paid here, she has paid there blah blah. That’s what I do because I don’t wanna owe anyone any money so I clear it that time itself or make sure next time I cover it up properly. But is that not a norm?

Now the good things are- 1. He gets me flowers each time we meet. 2. He is caring in terms of what I did in a day he would ask me. 3. He makes good plans of going out to a restaurant to eat. 4. He is also punjabi, so am I so we do vibe 5. He looks attractive 6. For my birthday when we had in fact just met once, he got me a bracelet, small tiny minimalistic one but that’s so sweet!?? 7. Each time he gets me flowers, he writes a note in it. The note can be very simple but that’s also sweet 8. He tells me whatever I feel like is wrong, I can tell him and he’ll fix it in himself 9. He’s a great boyfriend - makes plans, pampers

Bad things - 1. he doesn’t seem v warm natured 2. I see a lot of narcissistic traits 3. His family is based in Kolkata and I’m from Gurgaon, so I’m thinking from marriage perspective it might be a problem later idk? 4. I ideally wanted someone with good health, he has diabetes hereditary so he may get it. Which honestly is fine by me, but I wanted my kid to have a good health genes and thinking from that perspective it scares me. Since I have good health touchwood 5. His father and father’s side have hair baldness issue. So he is going to be bald when he gets older as well. He’s 25 now and I can already see 6. He also mentioned he has some family issues that he didn’t mention what it was

Now I feel I have been out of dating culture since 2 years, so I may be missing out on something’s or would’ve forgotten how it’s done, so pls remind me and let me know if I’m doing something wrong too. But I do feel this is not it, right? There’s something wrong with it. Pls tell me AITAH for wanting to breakup since he doesn’t give me husband vibes? But he’s a great boyfriend!

1or1hrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HolidayVisitCroatia/comments/1or1hrh/hvar_sunlit_squares_clear_coves_and_easy_island/,"Hvar: Sunlit Squares, Clear Coves, and Easy Island Days","Hvar delivers a clean mix of medieval stone, pine-scented bays, and a buzzy waterfront without feeling unmanageable. The old town is pedestrian, the harbor is compact, and the Pakleni Islands sit just across a short, scenic channel. Below is a concise run-through to help set expectations, sequence days, and avoid common snags.

https://preview.redd.it/w1qbnztk32xf1.jpg?width=3677&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01962eeeb902e7bfcf4cb758a4c50df39cd8cf53

**Why Hvar stands out**

* Fortica (Španjola) overlooks the harbor and Pakleni Islands; go for golden hour.
* St. Stephen’s Square is the social heart, framed by the Cathedral and the Arsenal with the historic public theatre.
* Taxi-boats in season make day tripping to Jerolim, Marinkovac/Stipanska, and Palmižana effortless.

**Two simple days**  
**Day 1:** Walk up to Fortica for views; coffee on the square; peek into the Cathedral and Arsenal; swim at Bonj or Pokonji Dol; sunset drink, courtyard dinner, relaxed bar.  
**Day 2:** Taxi-boat to the Pakleni Islands (Jerolim for quiet coves; Palmižana for long lunches; Stipanska for a party vibe). Return for a mellow Riva stroll or a late shuttle to Carpe Diem Beach.

**Beaches to know**

* Pokonji Dol: curving pebble bay east of town with seasonal spots.
* Mekićevica: a quieter cove beyond Pokonji Dol (bring water shoes).
* Bonj “Bene”: stone terraces by the west promenade.
* Dubovica: a postcard cove 8–10 km east; park above and walk down (go early in peak months).

**Nightlife snapshot**  
Sunset at Hula Hula; late options on Stipanska (Carpe Diem Beach). Central lanes wind down later than the Riva. Respect dress rules away from the beach and keep noise down in alleys—fines apply for public disorder.

**Food & wine**  
Menus lean fresh: grilled fish, octopus salad, black risotto. Wines worth ordering: Bogdanuša (crisp white) and Plavac Mali (structured red); Prč and Maraština appear too. Book tastings in season; keep lunches light before boat rides.

**Where to stay (in town only)**

* Old Town & Riva: atmospheric and lively, compact rooms, steps likely.
* West Side (Bonj/Amfora): resort feel, easy swims, sunset strolls, pleasant walk to the center.
* Hillside lanes: quieter, wide views, stairs involved.
* Križna Luka/Pokonji Dol: beach vibe, calmer evenings, straightforward walk or short ride.

**Getting there & around**  
Fast catamarans connect Split and Hvar Town in season; the car ferry runs Split–Stari Grad year-round (about 2 hours), with a short drive or bus onward. Drvenik–Sućuraj is the east-side car-ferry link (about 30 minutes). In town, walking covers most needs; buses and taxi-boats fill the gaps.

**Best time**  
Late May–June and September–early October bring warm seas, open services, and softer crowds. July–August is peak: hottest, busiest, and priciest—book boats and dinners early.

**Quick etiquette & practicals**  
Cover up off the beach, carry some cash for boats/kiosks, and bring water shoes for pebbly entries. Tap water is safe—use a refillable bottle. Leave stones and sea life undisturbed and keep music discreet on boats and beaches.

That’s the essentials in one place: clear water, stone beauty, straightforward logistics, and easy island rhythm.

1or1hgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1or1hgo/aitah_for_making_a_joke_calling_someone_a_btch/,AITAH For making a joke calling someone a B*tch ?,"Throwaway account. Context, I am a freshman at college and made a friend who plays Club women's Rugby. My friend, Jasmine, tried convincing me to join the club team for a while saying that I would fit in very well due to my humor. Eventually I started going the the practices and found that it very enjoyable. However due to my fear of being harmed and knowning that this is a very big contact sport I was very nervous to officially play. So I continued to go the practices but not playing in the weekends games. On top of it I work on the weekends and have other clubs and activities so I simply was just unable to go to the games, as they occasutally travel to Texas and it was too late to take the days off. Due to my lack of communication on my end and others, people began to question why I was at practices while not playing the games and speaking behind my back that I was only there for the social aspect. Which I will say that is alway a motivation for me to do anything as I am a social creature, I also wanted to step out of my comfort zone. 

So that leads me to the situation at hand. It was a Saturday and they had gotten back from their game and I had gotten back from work. My friend Jasmine told me that there were going to a house to celebrate/socialize. I asked to tag along and gave me the okay so I went. There Jasmine had said something or a joke at my expense however it was very light hearted so in responce I said you b\*tch it was intended to be more light then how I actually said it.   
After that night Jasmine finally told me about how many people did not like the joke I had made, and they were icing me out due to the issues stated previously, that night. I decided to send messaged to the Captain, and two other Girls explaining how I like the practices but am very busy. The captain and one of the girls were very understanding and very inviting fro me to return. However one of the girls Ill call her Grace I apologized to her with more specifics for the joke I as she was present and heard it first hand.

\- I Copied and Pasted the conversation as it was through Text

**Me:** ""Hey Grace I wanted to shoot you a message as a senior and a big influence on the Rugby team why I’m around and such. I heard from the grape vine that there are some who are upset I do not play and want to explain my situation. I originally stated going to practice on Jasmines insistence that I’d fit in with the rugby girls socially, for a while based on my humor and I really try to get along with people in general. The idea of rugby was kinda off putting to due to its similarity to football and I’ve never play any physical contact sport. When I finally went to a practice I honestly had a blast and put as much effort into as I could and at each practice (i genuinely put 100%). When it comes to playing the actual game I feel like I have a mental block I watched a few games on YouTube and during the practice/scrimmage I just genuinely am scared about being hurt and such. That’s not the only reason for my lack of playing as I work, Friday, Saturday and Sunday and for a while I didn’t have a car(I do now) would bike 4 miles to work but I’m also scheduled about a month in advance that there would have be no way to work it in. As much as I really like the practices and people Rugbys not the only thing I’m involved (Rover Club, Botany Club, AIAA, ESSA, E-1 Club) and so when If don’t show up to practice in the future for other clubs it’s not because rugby isn’t a priority I go to rugby bc I enjoy the time there as it pushes me to be better but I have responsibilities elsewhere too.  I send a message to Harper on wether she would allow me to still attend practice and as I’m sending the message to her at the same time as you I’m not sure if I’ll be returning in the future. I will not be at practice tonight to give her time to think about what she would like to do with me and due to other responsibilities I have to attend to. However if I do not return I would like to say thank you for the short time you were in my life and I’m grateful to have known you. You are a positive influence on those around you. I would like to also apologize to you. I have a close friendship with Jasmine as she lives across the hall and we spend time together a lot but so when I called her a bitch Saturday night I realized afterword that I really upset you. It was Intended it to be a joke but it came off wrong for that I’m sorry. 

**Grace:** ""Hey op, thank you for reaching out to explain. It is difficult with our team to have some people who are inconsistent because of how close knit the group becomes and how different skill levels affect practice. Its also difficult with your discomfort with contact because it is a major part of our sport. I will respect Harbert choice either way. And Believe me, i understand having a ton of clubs and commitments because i have the same kind of hectic schedule and overbook myself. I don’t want to run you off by any means, but yes i and others were very upset with you. I wouldn’t tolerate a comment like that about any of our teammates, let alone Jasmine who you clearly made uncomfortable with the comment. I have very little patience for mean spirited humor even when its meant with good intentions. I am sorry for how short i got with you after that, i should have just pulled you aside and talked to you. I know some others were upset as well and people have told me that you ask invasive questions and don’t understand boundaries. I know that sometimes those things can happen without it being communicated to you, so maybe you weren’t aware that people felt that way but i saw it Saturday too. People are entitled to their opinions and privacy, and we have to respect that. We also just have to be kind to one another, there are plenty of funny things to say that don’t involve being hateful, you know? Its just one of my pet peeves. I dont think you are a bad person, but i think you need to reevaluate the jokes you make and how your actions and words affect others. You don’t have to change for anyone else but you do have to be kind and considerate towards others, at least on this team"" 

**Me:** ""I get what you’re saying however I feel like practice is a very different type of contact then what the games are. It what makes me feel comfortable being at the practices and not the games. I also hear what you’re saying and understand that those type of joke aren’t for everyone. Some people can definitely take it and dish it and I’m glad to now know that those type of joke are not for the people of the team as I can adjust. As I doubt anyone would have told me had I not reached out to ask directly. I really like the girls so it’s never my intention to cause harm.  Social awareness has alway been a hit or miss for me. I love asking questions it’s in my nature to want to know more about people but in doing so I’m not sure if it’s my boldness, straightforward questions people feel as thought I will keep pushing for answers. And perhaps I neglected in these circumstances but I doubt it I always especially when asking hard hitting questions try ask “if you don’t mind me asking” or “you don’t have to answer if you don’t feel comfortable”. So I guess what I’m asking do you have any examples of what question I have asked that elicited these reactions? Or if there is any specific that I can apologize directly to one on one. I spoke with Harper and she glad to have me continue practicing however if I cannot  make up with the people who I have upset I would rather take my self out of the situation if apologizing does not lead to reconciliation and would not want to be a present of discomfort for them.""

**Haven:** ""Im going to return to this when i have more time to read it and respond""

\-----------

25hrs later: She did not respond to the message so in turn I sent two message to two separate girls could see I could have potentially offended apologizing about any harmful/mean joke I've made that they took offence to and if I had asked any personal or intrusion question Im sorry and such. 

\-----------

\*she said something about how she forgot to comeback to the conversation\*

**Grace:** ""Hey so the issue is that contact at practices should not be that different from game contact, thats something we are working towards as a whole. Its also important to practice reps with the teammates you will be on the field with come gametime. I actually dont have any examples of the questions, im the same way and ask very forward questions but i dont ever push if they dont seem open to talking. However yeah i think this is more than a matter of who can take it and who can dish it. There are teasing jokes that arent mean spirited, and that one definitely came off that way. But you are right, this team is not the place for that kind of humor. I dont think this is a matter of just apologizing either, yes that should happen, but also behavior has to change for apologies to mean anything. Im not airing anyones business if they dont want to discuss it with you, my recommendation is to make an effort to be less intrusive and kinder in general as opposed to making excuses for yourself and trying to explain your behavior""

**Me:** ""You’re totally okay I thought you were ramping ups to rip me apart(I’m joking). Point blank to me contact in practice was more comfortable due to the lack of it, . I plan to take pause on rugby and focus on my academics anyhow. However I feel as though we’re still not seeing eye to eye on one thing which is at no point did I try to reason/deem my actions okay. I explained my situation and owned up to it. We are different people so I you applaud for never having intruded on someone that you know of but clearly I human and can only learn from my mistakes. “Apologies with action” is something I too follow but to say I am justifying my action when you don’t who I am is a very hasty assumption. Especially when you and seeing as you mostly texted back bc I reached out to Heidi and Sage (to give them a sort of apology/explanation  since I’ve been around them most often and consistently and felt they were owned one). I take actions to fix issues I have caused because let’s be honest if I was someone who thought I never did wrong why would I apologize. This is not ment with aggression but I was the first people to reach out the moment I heard there was confusion/issues do not mistake my character."" 

**Grace:** ""I never said that i haven’t made someone uncomfortable. I am not perfect by any means and i know this. That was actually an attempt to connect over that because i certainly have and had to attempt to make it better too. I am just the messenger and trying to protect my teammates. As for not seeing eye to eye, you telling me how you are as a person and explaining your situation  reads like an excuse when it could be simple acknowledgement, apology, and improvement. Does that make sense? I am not assuming anything about your character, I’m going based on the conversation and interactions we have had. I dont want to make you out to be the bad guy or some awful person, i am just responding to what I’ve seen. I see that you are reaching out to make apologies which is good, they just don’t have to accept them. I dont know enough to accurately mediate, but as president it is my job to meet you with honesty and to try to sort it out with the team in mind""

**Me:** ""In the nicest way the definition of reason is “think, understand, and form judgement by a process of logic”   Which is me explaining the process of logic in my actions, aka, a reason.  By no means is that equivocal to an “attempt to lessen the blame attaching to (a fault or offense); seek to defend or justify” or in other words an excuse. I quite literally said my action were wrong, and I apologized for it with sincerity. I’m not trying to makes up with people for my peace I can live with the actions as I’m always doing what I feel is right/just. You’re assuming that I want their forgiveness when I have said on multiple occasions that they deserve an apologize. On top of it I don’t actually know who the people are I’m shooting in the dark. As someone who came from theater as Stage manger, and Debate Vice president i know what it looks like to approach a situation and clear things up. What you did was stay silent until approached. I’m not trying to steer the conversation away from the topic at hand which is “I made a mistake and i apologize for what I did and have contacted this who i believe where effected and hurt by my actions.” Do no give you’re self credit for guiding this bc I did. I’m want to clear things up with you so please do no take what I’m saying as rude and if it does please let me know. I’m trying to be a straight forward as I can be because I want to return in the spring, and am thinking of talking with who ever is the coach perhaps as media manger or sorts. I like these conversations as it allows me insight on others opinions""  

**Grace:** ""I didn't think this was a debate nor do i understand why this has become such a large debate. I am not the one that gets to decide if you come back or not, im just trying to respond to what you brought up and what ive been told. I also came from speech and debate and im actively still in drama. I am not taking credit for anything, im just telling you why i care at all. I was going to let it be because i realized i was being shitty too, but i thought it was deserved.  I dont know when that opportunity to talk in person will be, but if it arises then sure. I am not playing next semester as im graduating, but i hope you can work out whatever grievances you have with the players""

**Me:** ""I feel that we’re trying to get our feeling out and it’s leading to misunderstanding. I’ve already reached out to those who may have been upset, Heidi, Sage they need not respond if they do not want to as it’s their own choice “to forgive and to not forgive”. I don’t like leaving this here so at anytime would you be free for an hour for coffee.""

We all love the taste of crispy, golden-brown food—think french fries, chicken wings, or perfectly roasted Brussels sprouts. But the process? The huge pot of oil, the splattering mess, the lingering grease smell, and the guilt that comes with deep frying? Not so much.

For years, we've been told that getting that crave-worthy texture without a deep fryer was impossible. Then, the air fryer showed up. And if you're on the fence about whether it's just another fad gadget that will end up gathering dust, I'm here to tell you: it's not. It’s a game-changer.

## So, What Exactly *Is* an Air Fryer?

Despite the name, an air fryer doesn't actually fry anything. It's a small, high-powered convection oven. The magic is in the way it circulates super-hot air around your food at high speed.

### It's Not Actually Frying

This rapid air movement cooks the food quickly while creating a crispy, browned exterior. This process is called the Maillard reaction—it’s the same chemical reaction that gives seared steaks and roasted coffee their delicious flavor and texture. So, you get all the crispy satisfaction of frying, but using only a fraction of the oil (sometimes none at all!).

## Why an Air Fryer Will Change How You Cook

If you're still wondering what all the hype is about, here are the core benefits that make an air fryer an indispensable tool in any modern kitchen.

-   **Unbeatable Crispiness:** This is the main event. Chicken skin gets shatteringly crisp. Potatoes become fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Reheated pizza tastes better than the first time you had it.
-   **Speed and Efficiency:** An air fryer preheats in minutes, not the 15-20 minutes a full-size oven requires. Since the cooking space is small and concentrated, food cooks much faster.
-   **Healthier Cooking:** You can achieve incredible results with just a light spritz of oil. That means you’re cutting down significantly on calories and fat compared to traditional deep frying.
-   **Easy Cleanup:** Most air fryer baskets have a non-stick coating and are dishwasher-safe. A little hot, soapy water is often all you need. No more vats of oil to dispose of.
-   **Incredible Versatility:** This is not a one-trick pony. Beyond the ""fried"" classics, you can roast, bake, and reheat. We're talking perfectly cooked salmon, juicy chicken breasts, roasted vegetables, and even mini cakes or donuts.

## Let's Talk Food: What Can You Actually Make?

The best way to understand the power of air frying is to see what it can do. Here's a tiny sample to get your creativity flowing:

-   **The Classics:** Homemade french fries, sweet potato fries, crispy chicken wings, and onion rings.
-   **Surprising Proteins:** Filet mignon, salmon fillets with a crispy skin, meatballs, and chicken breast that stays incredibly moist.
-   **Roasted Veggies:** Broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and bell peppers get beautifully charred and tender without getting soggy.
-   **Even... Desserts?** You can make individual brownies, baked apples, or even donut bites from canned biscuit dough.

## My Top Pro-Tips for Air Frying Success

Ready to jump in? Follow these tips to go from novice to air fryer pro in no time.

### 1. Don't Crowd the Basket
This is the golden rule. The hot air needs space to circulate. If the basket is too full, your food will steam instead of crisp. Cook in batches if you need to.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=air%20fryer)

### 2. Give It a Shake
For even results, pause the cooking halfway through and give the basket a good shake or use tongs to flip your food. This ensures every side gets that perfect, all-over crunch.

### 3. A Little Oil Goes a Long Way
While you don't need much, a tiny bit of oil helps with browning and prevents food from sticking. A quick spray with an oil mister is the perfect way to coat everything lightly.

### 4. Use a Meat Thermometer
Don't guess with proteins like chicken or steak. An instant-read thermometer will guarantee your food is cooked safely and perfectly every time.

## The One Thing I Wish I'd Known Sooner

When I first started air frying, my biggest frustrations were small items (like diced potatoes or shrimp) falling through the basket slots, and certain foods sticking even with oil. It made cleanup a pain.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=air%20fryer)

Then I discovered reusable silicone liners or air fryer pots.

> They are an absolute lifesaver. They fit perfectly inside the basket, preventing food from sticking or falling through. Cleanup goes from a five-minute scrub to a 30-second rinse. They’re perfect for making smaller batches of things like quiche, frittatas, or even for cooking marinated chicken wings with no mess. Finding this simple accessory completely transformed how I use my air fryer, making it even more of a daily workhorse.

## Is It Really Worth It?

After using one for a long time, I can say with confidence: absolutely. The air fryer isn't just about making ""fried"" food healthier. It's about making delicious food *faster* and *easier*. It handles a surprising number of cooking tasks so well that it often replaces my full-size oven for weeknight meals.

It's earned its permanent spot on my counter, right next to my coffee maker. It's not a gimmick; it's a fundamentally brilliant tool that delivers on its promises. If you love great food and value your time, you won't regret it.

May rolled around, and the remaining 4 hikers are still missing. I gathered up our rent money and headed down the stairs to the office that Mark basically lived in, to pay the rent. 



“Hey Mark, here’s our cut for the month.” I said handing him an envelope of cash.



“Our? Oh yeah… How’s that girlfriend ya got? Is everything going alright?” He asked with a snide grin.



“Yeah, Liv’s alright. We work a lot so we’ve been bonding over shitty pizza and daytime TV. “



I observed Mark, and even though he never really looked up at me, I noticed he looked a little… different? 



“Anyway, Mark, I’m gonna get going. I've got a meeting. I’ll talk to ya later, man.” 



After my monotonous monthly meeting, I was greeted by Liv. She was a little more frisky than what I was used to, especially at 2pm.. One thing led to another and the unthinkable finally happened. After years of practical celibacy, it finally happened. But that later made my head swarm with the ideas, what is Liv doing at night? Why has it taken her so long to touch me? Is she cheating on me? Am I just insecure? What the hell is going on? 



Once Olivia got out of the shower, I sat down to talk with her. Told her that maybe my mind hasn’t been right lately. She assured me that we were fine, although, she claims ever since my talk with Joe, I’ve been acting strange. Maybe she’s right. But as someone who just got pulled into their crazy neighbors house at mach jesus, and told a very traumatic story, followed by questioning from the police, and everyone claiming that Liv doesn’t exist, yet somehow her phone was at a crime scene… How could I be expected to be my normal self? Things were strange. An unreasonable amount of strange at that. Things are just fucked up. That’s the best way I could put it. But the information that disrupted our conversation just confirmed that thought. 



We heard an emergency broadcast come across the TV… They found the hikers. Dismembered, nothing but bone. No way to identify them, other than speaking to their friend, who was somehow still alive. They showed the body cam footage of the rescue. This woman wasn’t identified, but immediately there was some familiarity. Though she was skin and bone, her eyes and cheeks were sunken in, and from the looks of her cold wet flesh surrounded by a police blanket, and a deputy’s jacket, you could tell she was not only freezing, but extremely malnourished. She was basically halfway to death. She had to have been out there for 2 months. But what could cause *that* much fear to turn someone into that much of a hollow shell of themselves? 



“She looks familiar, doesn’t she?” Liv asked. 



“You know, I was thinking the same thing. I just can’t place where I’ve seen her bef-” 



“Isn’t that your ex-wife, John? Isn’t that Kylie?” she asked, concerned. 



“No, there’s no…”



Just then they broadcast her name. 

“Kylie Mae Adamms. 29 of Erie Pennsylvania. If anyone has any information, please reach out to the County Sheriff’s Office as soon as possible. Thank you, and remember, stay safe and lock those doors. “



“John… I’m so sorry.” she said. 



Now at this point, my head was circling so fast I could practically hear time freeze. How did Liv know that was Kylie just off of a few pictures I have buried in my sock drawer? She doesn’t even look human anymore, let alone, anything like herself. 



“I- I gotta go- I gotta- uh- fuck. I don’t….”



“John. Go. Go call, or go to the station. Make sure she’s okay!” Liv demanded. 



I grabbed my coat and headed for the door. 

“Lock this behind me. And Liv,""



“Yeah?” 



“I love you.”



“I love you too. Go be there for her.”



Right as I went to open the door, I was greeted by the police. 



“Son, we got some bad news…”



“Yeah okay, let um. Let’s just go.”



We got to the station, and they did the usual. Sat me down, asked me a bunch of questions about Kylie, and why we split. If I knew of anyone who would target her in such a way. Why was she out there in the first place? Questions about her mental state. The last time we spoke or saw each other. 



I told them as easily as possible. We were childhood sweethearts. We split because the financial 

The police officers slowly opened the door and told Kylie that someone had come to collect her. My heart was in my throat at this point. She sat on a detainment bed in sweat pants and a gray sweatshirt with a cup of coffee. She was shivering and rocking back and forth with a blank stare aimed at her knees while a tattered gray blanket draped over her shoulders. I sat beside her. 



“Kylie, it’s John… I just needed to know you were okay. Apparently I’m still your emergency contact.”



She stopped rocking and turned to me in a shivering glare. 

Time seemed to freeze. The coffee mug slid from her hand and came crashing down on the concrete floor. She began screaming with so much fear, it was almost like an animal’s cry for help. She backed herself into the corner on the bed screaming. The police swarmed the room to remove me and calm her down. Which took a light sedative to get her there. 



“YOU’RE NOT REAL! YOU’RE NOT REAL! YOU’RE NOT REAL! Y-YOU JUST WANT TO TRICK ME AND EAT ME LIKE THE REST, GOD DAMN IT, I’VE SEEN YOU ALREADY BEFORE, AND I KNOW YOUR MIND TRICKS. YOU AREN’T FUCKING REAL!” She screamed while sobbing into the officer's chest. 



What? I was her husband for 5 years. Boyfriend since we were kids. How could she-”

Joe's words started to swarm my mind. “Mind altering creatures.” Maybe she encountered one and it was playing with her mind? And even worse, pretending to be me? No, that’s not possible… 

I asked the officer. “Sir, um. I have this neighbor downstairs, his name is Joe. Do you think I could go home and talk to him? Or maybe you can bring him in and I can ask him a few questions and try to get this figured out?”



“Do you think our office works off of conspiracy, son? What you do when you’re outside is none of my concern. But when you’re in here, everything goes on record. Everything.” 



“Right…Is Kylie gonna need, you know? Psychiatric help?” I asked nervously.



“I think it’s evident that something scared the bejeezus out of that poor girl. Something ain’t right, but I think she’s definitely going to need some help, yes. Now, do you know why she was acting that way when you walked in?” 



“No sir, I honestly couldn’t tell you because I'd never seen her act that way. She’s usually calm. Talks like a sailor, but calm, nonetheless."" 



“Hm. Well. Something ain't right with that poor girl, and we’re gonna send her down to Endless Mountains and see what could be done. We’re gonna take care of her, John. I promise.  Ya need a ride home son?” 



“If you wouldn’t mind. I just hope Olivia’s alright.”



When I arrived home, Mike, Jeff, Joe and the new neighbor all watched with curious stares as the police dropped me off. I couldn’t be bothered with any of them so I just went upstairs. Liv was glad to see me, and had a million questions. But I couldn’t be bothered to answer any of them. All I could do was lock myself in my office and stare out at the tree line. What’s really out there? What could have done this to Kylie? Should I have reached out sooner? Maybe I could have prevented this. No, I can’t sit here and blame myself. Why would she think I was one of those things? I lifted my head from my hand as Liv knocked on my office door. 

“John, are you okay babe? Wanna talk about it?” She asked hesitantly.



“Yeah, I’m alright. Are these-”



“Sympathy potatoes?  Yes. You should eat something.”



 We sat to eat and talk about what had happened. I mentioned the idea of talking to Joe, but Liv was dead set on me not speaking with him. Said that he was crazy, but in retrospect, his ‘crazy’ was starting to make some sort of sense to me. I mean, what else could I lean on for some sort of explanation of what had happened to Kylie?



A few days had gone by and the sheriff’s department had issued a statement about what had happened, and how they couldn’t know the cause for sure because the surviving victim was deemed unfit due to reasons of insanity. She was getting psychiatric help. Liv was back to work, I tried to continue on knowing what I know, but I started to listen in more to Joe’s rants as I worked. I made sure to update Kylie’s parents about what had happened, since they lived about 5 hours from here in a town called Honesdale, and they were thankful. I told them if I had heard anything else, that I’d inform them, and her father plans on coming down, but I couldn’t stop thinking about Kylie, and well… my mother before she had passed. 



My mother had gotten sick in her final months, but she wouldn’t let that stop her. She couldn’t stand to be around my father, since his form of a hobby became finding the bottom of a bottle since my older brother’s passing in 2009. My mother had taken up volunteering for the girl scout troops and a summer science camp. After one of their expeditions, my mother returned, well… Different. She was afraid of the slightest sound, practically bolted the windows shut, stayed quiet most of the time unless she was listening to music, or speaking with my father or I. That’s when it hit me. My mother came to life the night of the accident. Like universally, she knew she was going to die. 



You hear it all of the time. People on hospice come to life and back to their old spirits right before they pass on. But that’s not what shocked me, it’s that after almost an entire year, I remembered my father’s final words. “Was that… Dylan?” My brother, Dylan. Who had died from a drug overdose at a bonfire. My father had seen my dead brother in the middle of the road, and swerved to not hit him, lost control of the car, and drove into the ditch. My mother cried out for him as she took her last breath, and before I lost consciousness. I know it sounds crazy considering his ashes were now in my office, but I’m starting to get the vision in my head from the illuminated road that night, and there was definitely a man in the road. I just know it… 



Regardless. I HAD to talk to Joe. burden got the best of us. I wouldn’t know why she was out hiking, but she’s always been the outdoorsy type, it’s the way her father brought her up. Her mental state was fine, she suffered from seasonal depression, and I couldn’t remember the last time I saw her. 



The last I could recall, she was standing over my bedside while I slept when I had my concussion, but I’m not sure if that’s true or not due to the concussion. 



“Can I see her?” I asked nervously.



“Are you sure you want to do that right now? Her mental state is extremely delicate at this point, and we don’t know what she’s been through.” 



“I’m sure.”



“Alright son. Short and sweet.” The officer said as he rose from his chair and began leading back to where they were holding her. 



I’ve dreamt of this moment. What I would say to her if I got another chance to see her again. I didn’t know she was still in the area. I didn’t know she still hiked. And even more so, I didn’t know she never changed her name from mine. It’s been 2 years since the divorce and I had no idea she was even missing. How fucking arrogant am I? But none of that matters now, because it’s just me and her, and this? This is about her.

1or1eyy,https://i.redd.it/upe8rdhhjvzf1.jpeg,[Anti-Aging] Looking for advice on routine and maybe preventative botox...Not liking my aging skin.,"Hey guys, took some courage to make this post. I’m 31 years old and looking through my old photos, I am really starting to notice my age. I work a stressful job and am nervous it’s making me age, so looking for some additions to combat it. I’m pretty on top of my skincare routine, but I’m looking for additional advice and am also curious on people’s thoughts regarding preventative Botox. The attached picture has no edits, makeup, and natural sunlight — this is me “just rolled out of bed”. I haven’t done my skins care routine yet.

Morning Routine:

* Cetaphil/Cera Ve gentle cleanser (whatever Costco has in bulk when I go)
* Alastin HA serum 
* Alastin Trihex Technology serum 
* Alastin Restorative Under Eye Cream
* Alastin ultra nourishing moisturizer
* Alastin Hydra Tint Mineral sunscreen (I wear it when I leave the house, but I work from home in Chicago and am not exposed to regular sunlight… I know I should be wearing it all the time though so I’m working on that
* Vital Proteins Collagen Powder in my coffee

Nighttime Routine:

* Cetaphil / Cera Ve gentle cleanser
* Bioeffect EGF Serum

Once a month I get either an IPL treatment, Chemical Peel, or a hydra facial depending on the needs of my skin that month. I usually opt for IPL and sometimes combine IPL and hydrafacials. I get reoccurring broken capillaries all over my face during the Chicago winter hence the IPL.

I’ve been on this routine for \~3 years… occasional tret use from curology, but my skin struggles at even the lowest fraction of a percent w it h continues use. Tried other products like tatcha dewy skin cream (love this but gave the Alastin brand a chance because I got it free and loved it). Tried triple lipid skins cream from skin ceuticals and it wasn’t hydrating enough. Also tried their vitamin e that’s a lot of peoples holy grail, but it also didn’t do much for me after 2 bottles. I really used to struggle with keeping my skin moisturized but it seems happy current state so long as I don’t use Tret (like my skin won’t tolerate 0.009% without freaking out). I use lanolin for my lips, but it’s starting to get colder here and they’re adjusting to the season… for reference I’m originally from FL so Chicago winters have been a struggle.

Anyways, open to all recommendations and am also considering starting preventative Botox. I don’t have much in the way of wrinkles but have noticed fine lines in my forehead, probably from furrowing at my computer screen. If you have any feedback on preventative Botox, would love that as well!",0,1762538386.0,SkincareAddiction,13,0.5,False

Walking into a home goods store can be overwhelming. Aisles upon aisles of shiny, promising kitchen appliances, each one claiming to be the one thing you absolutely can't live without. It’s easy to end up with a closet full of single-task gadgets that just gather dust.

The secret isn't to own more. It's to own *smarter*. It's about investing in a few core kitchen appliances that genuinely make your life easier, your food tastier, and your time in the kitchen more enjoyable. This isn't about chasing trends; it's about building a functional, reliable setup that works for you.

## The Foundation: Core Appliances for Every Home

If you're starting from scratch or looking to upgrade the basics, these are the workhorses. They pull their weight day in and day out.

1.  **A Reliable High-Speed Blender.** Don't just think smoothies. A powerful blender is the engine for silky soups, creamy sauces, homemade nut butters, and even fresh flours from whole grains. A cheap blender will leave you with chunky results and frustration. A good one is a long-term investment in texture and flavor.

2.  **A Versatile Stand Mixer.** Yes, it's a baker's best friend for dough and batter. But with the right attachments, it becomes a pasta maker, a meat grinder, a vegetable shredder, and more. It's a true multi-tasker that saves you immense time and effort.

3.  **The Multi-Tasking Air Fryer/Toaster Oven.** Counter space is precious. That's why a combination appliance is a game-changer. A quality air fryer toaster oven can handle everything from crisping up leftover fries to roasting a whole chicken to baking a small pizza. It preheats faster than a big oven and uses less energy, making it perfect for quick weeknight meals.

## Beyond the Obvious: Game-Changing Kitchen Tools

Once you have the basics down, there are a few less-common kitchen appliances that I wish I’d found years sooner. They solve specific, everyday frustrations in ways you might not expect.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=kitchen%20appliances)

### The Immersion Blender: Your Secret Weapon for Soups and Sauces

Do you remember the last time you made soup? You probably had to ladle scalding hot liquid into a blender in batches, creating a mess and risking a dangerous splash. An immersion blender eliminates that entirely. You stick it right into the pot, and in seconds, you have perfectly blended soup with zero fuss and minimal cleanup. It’s also fantastic for emulsifying salad dressings and making small batches of sauce right in the pan.

### The High-Speed Sous Vide Machine: Perfect Results, No Guesswork

Cooking the perfect steak or a tender, juicy chicken breast can feel like a lottery. One minute too long and it's dry. Sous vide (a method of cooking in a precisely controlled water bath) takes the guesswork out of it. You seal your food in a bag, set the temperature, and the machine does the rest. It cooks food to the exact doneness you want, every single time. You just finish it with a quick sear in a pan for flavor and texture. It’s the ultimate confidence-booster for anyone who wants consistent, impressive results.

### The Countertop Ice Maker: A Small Appliance with a Huge Impact

This might sound like a luxury, but think about it. How often have you gone to make an iced coffee or a cocktail, only to find the ice tray is empty or those two last cubes are stuck together? A small, fast countertop ice maker produces perfect, clear bullets of ice in minutes. It's a small thing, but the convenience is immense, especially when you have guests over. No more planning ahead for ice.

## How to Choose the Right Appliances for *You*

This list is a starting point, not a rigid checklist. The best set of kitchen appliances is the one that matches your lifestyle. Before you buy anything new, ask yourself:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=kitchen%20appliances)

-   **What do I cook most often?** If you're a soup lover, that immersion blender is a must. If you bake bread every weekend, a stand mixer is non-negotiable.
-   **How much counter and storage space do I have?** Be realistic. A giant appliance that lives in your garage because it's too heavy to lift isn't helping anyone. Look for multi-function tools if space is tight.
-   **What is my biggest kitchen frustration?** Is it chopping onions? Is it waiting for water to boil? Find an appliance that directly solves that pain point. That's where you'll see the most value.

Ultimately, the goal is to fill your kitchen with tools that bring you joy and make you feel like a more capable, confident cook. It's about making the process of creating a meal feel less like a chore and more like the rewarding, creative act it's meant to be.",1,1762538265.0,bestkitchentool,0,1.0,False

1or1b71,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1or1b71/everyday_realisations_when_you_put_it_all/,Everyday realisations- when you put it all together it sounds bad,"So at the moment I’m staying at home for a few months and I’ll be moving out again in the new year. I just need somewhere to vent so I don’t literally go mad. 

It’s been really bad with my mom lately after having gotten on ok for a while. For some background.. 

I was raised by my mom as a single parent and led to believe my dad wasn’t interested in having kids, years later I discovered that the thing I’d literally been sad about for years (ending my parents relationship prematurely, not being wanted by this guy etc) could have been avoided entirely as my mom actually had no idea who my biological dad was something I’ll never fully heal from as I feel I need to know if I have other family. I was bullied at school but when I look back I see a lot of it was literally down to really bad advice my mom gave me on how to react to people leaving me out or not inviting me to things (to pretend I was happy as I hated that thing (bowling for example), and extremely bad advice on how to respond to bullying type comments by standing up for myself (with ‘smart’ responses ie- well I can cut my hair/shave my legs/buy different clothes etc but you can’t change that ugly face). 

It escalated a lot more than if I had kept my head down and ignored it in my opinion but again no parents are perfect. However I do remember always feeling it was my fault as if I ever got bullied badly or into a fight or a teacher got me into trouble, I’d always feel my mom felt it was my fault. She’d say things like ‘are you sure you said exactly what I told you to say’ or ‘I don’t see how that happened if you did X, Y or Z’ or ‘what did you do to give them the excuse to do that. Then when I was a teenager if I ever snapped as hormonal teenage girls do then she’d always come back with ‘no wonder nobody wants to be your friend and stick up for you at school, when you act so mean’. This lasted into my first job where I got in trouble for doing something wrong and I was very disappointed in myself and she said I was stupid because any idiot would have lied and not admitted they’d done anything to the manager in the first place. Everything was a contradiction. If my grades were bad it was the schools fault one day and the next day it was because I didn’t try hard or I was stupid. If I got hit by a boy at school one day it was not my fault but the next day it was karma for my bad behaviour at home. I’d be told girls were jealous of my looks one day and the next day be told I was nothing compared to how my mother looked when she was my age. 

Other things were just really bizarre. When I was turning 16 she tried to set me up with a student who was in university. And I was a bit confused by it and she’s like ‘you are allowed a boyfriend you know, you are allowed to date’ you are very mature and intelligent so maybe that’s why you don’t like the guys who are your age you need somebody older. I remember feeling really icky about it. But then to contrast this when I was in university and she found out I’d lost my virginity to someone who wasn’t in a relationship with me she said she was very disappointed in me and called me a ‘sl*t’. 

Another thing that was big when I was in university is that she spend $7,000 in my name on online gambling which she did eventually pay back through instalments but that and similar issues over time have led to me having financial insecurity/scarcity mindset etc and bad credit. 
Regardless of all this we have managed to have an OK relationship on and off over the years. 

I’ve just had an argument with her where she has essentially said the reason I have friends is because I get peer pressured when in large groups and have a problem with alcohol and that when she saw me at a party I was the first person to start on shots and encouraging others to do shots and that most people were probably thinking I was mad as it wasn’t even that late yet and nobody else even had an interest in doing shots until I was. And also that I drink too much coffee. 

( bear in mind this person drinks daily and smokes ( both habits I’ve been blamed for over the years because I stress them out so much- she said she’d easily quit smoking if I wasn’t a source of stress - she’s smoked since the age of 13..)

And that along with becoming unhealthy, she also thinks I’m going to fail in my career which is something she says she has always been more supportive of than any other parent is of their kids careers.

It's been about 6 months since I last had bloodwork that supposedly said my levels were good after starting medication.        

However, the severe fatigue has only marginally improved.      
I've also started having joint pain and my hair is falling out at an alarming rate.    

In the last few weeks, I've kind of had a bit of an ache in the left side of my chest that comes and goes.      
Then yesterday morning I sort of collapsed.     

I woke up early, stood up, and felt really weird. Light headed, I guess. My husband asked if I could start the coffee pot and I took a few steps into the kitchen and went down like a tower of bricks.      

It was like I was trying to walk on waves. Hit my knee pretty hard but didn't pass out.     
Scared the crap out of my spouse who got me off the ground and we started walking to the bedroom and I guess I fell again.     
He managed to lower to me to the floor and says my face and lips were super pale.     

He kept asking if we needed to go to the ER. I said no, sat on the ground for like 10 minutes until I felt normal again, and then went back to bed for an hour. Then I went to work and I was fine.    

He's freaked out and made me a doctor's appointment but I'm just dreading it.      

I'm a relatively fat woman with a documented history of substance abuse (clean 3 years!), anxiety, and have been treated unbelievably badly by the medical system so many times.     
I also smoke cigarettes, which I've been cutting back on but haven't stopped completely.      

I have a doctor's appointment on Monday and I'm torn between denial about whether or not this is actually a big deal and afraid that they're just going to dismiss me.     

""Stop smoking, lose weight, stay hydrated, blah blah blah.""     

Husband can't come with me because he'll be at work.     

What do I need to be asking them for? Bloodwork obviously, but what else? ",4,1762538128.0,TwoXChromosomes,5,1.0,False

I enjoy people who are thoughtful, grounded, and can laugh at life without needing everything to be perfect. The best conversations are ones that start easy and end somewhere meaningful.

I’m 27 and from England. I run my own business, which keeps me busy but gives me the freedom to shape my days. Most mornings start with coffee and a walk with my dogs before the world wakes up. I enjoy cooking and baking, experimenting with new recipes or perfecting the ones that bring a bit of nostalgia. I also spend time on film photography and love noticing small details in the world that most people might miss. Being outside, whether it’s walking, running, or just sitting in nature, helps me feel focused and present. Animals and plants bring me a quiet kind of joy, even when they refuse to cooperate.

I like people who appreciate simple pleasures but still enjoy little surprises life can offer. Someone who values connection, emotional awareness, and honesty. Someone who understands that meaningful interaction takes effort but should also feel easy. I enjoy humour that sneaks up on you, conversations that wander, and quiet moments that leave an impression.

1or0wii,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1or0wii/psa_what_to_do_after_a_house_fire_follow_up/,PSA: What TO DO After a House Fire - Follow Up,"You all asked for it after sharing the list of what not to do, so here is the follow up on steps homeowners should take immediately after a fire to protect your property, sanity and health:

**1. Secure the property**

Weather, animals and people can access your house through broken windows and doors due to firefighting efforts. It is always recommended to board up the property the same day as the loss to prevent this. Additionally, a walkthrough of the house should be done to ensure all windows and doors unbroken are locked and secured before leaving the site.

Standing water can escalate damage in a matter of hours/days. You've seen what a ring of moisture can do to a coffee table, now image inches to even feet of stagnant water on your hardwood floors and the damage that can cause. If moisture is present, this can likely wait, but standing water should be removed from the property as soon as possible. Now, If the fire subsides at 2 am, waiting until the start of the work day is perfectly acceptable, but often times insurance won't address the loss for 24-48+ hours, and in that time drywall absorbs water and becomes unstable, ceilings can collapse from water pooling above, floors can weaken or warp and wood framing can swell or crack.

As the homeowner it is your responsibility and documented in your policy to mitigate further damage. Theft and additional damage caused by inaction **can** be cause for insurance to deny this **part** of your claim. Emergency mitigation night of can be a smart decision, any other restoration efforts can wait at least until the next day or when the adjuster is involved.



**2. Contact your insurance company early.**

You don’t need to rush into decisions or sign anything, but you do want the claim officially opened. Ask what documentation they’ll need, what’s covered for temporary housing, and whether they offer vendor recommendations (you can choose whoever you want). Take time before signing anything long-term.

Anyone can file a claim for you. Your agent who wrote the policy, an adjuster, or even the customer service representative you get to after calling your insurance's 1-800 number. Open the claim and document your policy number, the adjuster's name and contact information, and a timeline of when you should be hearing from them. You can now verify if any vendors you've talked with are preapproved in their system.

So many people forget or don't know to do this but discuss policy limits, especially regarding ALE (additional living expenses).  ALE is a separate bucket you pay into your monthly premiums that covers everything from the additional food costs to the housing of you and your family in a hotel or house. This money does **not** come out of your buckets for structure or contents, and is intended to help you get through a loss, while the rest of the buckets help address the loss.

**Example**. I was helping a mom and her child (renters) deal with a small/moderate fire loss in their kitchen caused by an external contractor (no fault of their own). She informed me they had $10,000 ALE policy limit. I also learned the insurance put her into an Air BnB directly across from her house, in the same neighborhood. While this place was very nice and like kind and quality, the cost of renting this place for just one month was well over half her allotted ALE. This means she wouldn't even get two months before having to pay out of pocket. Keep in mind the extra food costs, immediate clothing, toiletries, etc. that all eat at this bucket as well.



**3. Photograph and document everything - more than you think you need to.**

Take wide shots, closeups, and full video walkthroughs. Open drawers, closets, pantries, cabinets, and storage areas. Capture model numbers when possible. Even inexpensive items add up quickly, and thorough documentation protects you during the claim. Keep every receipt from expenses immediately following a loss. Nearly everything can be reimbursed by your insurance when submitted to them. It is truly impossible to over-document the loss. Photos! Photos! Photos!



**4. Be thoughtful about who you authorize for work.**

Emergency services like board-up and water extraction are immediate, but everything else can wait until you’re ready. You’re never required to sign full restoration or rebuild contracts on the spot. Get clear explanations and don’t work with anyone using pressure tactics.

**Importantly**, this is your home and your property. You can sign on with a company for immediate mitigation and if they prove disrespectful, non-communicative, provide sloppy work, or any other red flags, you have the right to kick them off the job at any point. Just because you authorize them for the work does not mean they have the right to continue against your wishes, it only means you/your insurance is required to pay them for work they have already completed.  Restoration companies work for you! I'd recommend not being too trigger happy with kicking off contracts, as this will severely slow down the restoration process, but you do not need to accept sub-par performance. Talk to someone higher up to see if differences can be resolved, but ultimately, make the best decision for yourself and your property.



**5. Remember that smoke travels farther than the fire.**

Even small, contained fires often push soot into closets, drawers, HVAC ductwork, attics, and rooms nowhere near the source. Don’t assume unaffected rooms are clean. Any restoration company should be able to walk through and test each room individually and show the level of soot exposure to you and the adjuster. Just because soot is not visible to the naked eye does not mean it is not present. Missing these areas in the restoration process can result in lingering smells, negative health effects, and devaluing of your contents.

  
**6. How to clean up smoke and soot damage.**

If the loss is severe enough to get insurance involved, it is recommended to let the restoration company deal with the soot affected areas/contents. Due to policy limits or external factors, it might be necessary to clean soot on your own. In this case it is important to remember two qualities of soot. Soot is both acidic in nature and electronically conductive. This means soot particles are attracted to colder surfaces, and can force itself into cavities you wouldn't immediately assume. Above door frames, closer to windows, wall studs and even every nail behind drywall can offer cooler and metallic surfaces for soot to attract to. Because of this electric charge, soot webs can accumulate in corners and on walls of a room exposed to smoke. This is not the soot highlighting spiderwebs due to a messy living environment, but the actual particles binding to itself and settling. 100% rubber dry cleaning sponges are the industry standard for both detecting and cleaning sooted areas. Contents should be evaluated in a case-by-case scenario as the more non-porous a material, the easier it is to remove soot. When wet cleaning to address soot contamination, varying strengths of alkaline products are used to counteract the acidic soot particles. Always pretest a less visible areas of the item to see how the material will react to the cleaning agent before treating the entire piece.

  
Soot is a **source** for odor. The source must be removed if any hopes of removing the odor are to be achieved 



**7. Look after your health.**

Limit time in heavily sooted areas, especially if you experience headaches or irritation. Avoid staying overnight until the structure is deemed safe. Soot is carcinogenic, breathing in burned insulation can cause bronchitis and aggravate asthma, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form when plastics are burned and are highly toxic for the human respiratory track. Ventilation, Ozone and Hydroxyl machines, Air scrubbers with HEPA and carbon filters and/or negative air chambers will help clean and restore your property to a safe environment. There is no wide-spread equipment that can detect smoke related odors better than the human nose. If you smell it, more efforts to remove the odor are likely required.

Be aware of ""phantom"" or ""heightened awareness"" odors. We become nose blind to fowl odors the longer we are exposed to them. Don't determine an item is odorless if it is still on site during an active restoration process. Similarly, experiencing a fire loss is traumatic and can trigger negative memory responses by the olfactory lobe. If well after the loss you believe the smell is just not going away, ask for a second opinion. A friend, family member, or one of your contractors can bring the item off site and do a blind smell test. if multiple people cannot detect anything this is likely a phantom odor and can indicate an involuntarily traumatic response your mind is remembering.

Dealing with a fire loss can be exhausting, prioritize protecting your physical and mental health throughout the restoration process. ",17,1762537213.0,homeowners,1,0.95,False

So, it's a stranger this side; nothing much to say about me, but just for your kind knowledge — you can read ""about me"" in the pinned section, if you wish. 

Basically, there's nothing much to share about my boring life these days, that is why I'm looking for: Someone, who's too much talkative. Always full of stories and situations to vent out on her daily life. I'm sure you're always filled with something to say. So, I'm looking for being someone's ""Acha Suno toh, uske aage ye hua na ki"" partner... Also, you won't mind if I don't speak much, just listen to you and respond when needed, facing a lowkey these days.

Not mandatory to be a RELATIONSHIP. Also, comfortable in just ""listen to me"" FRIENDSHIP. 

All the Non-negotiable Conditions:
1. You need to be extremely talkative.
2. You need to be elder than 24 years of age.
3. You need to be extremely comfortable with CALLS 🤙🏻 from the first conversation itself (as I can't text much)
4. It's okay to be childish, but not every time; there is a need to show visible signs of maturity inside.

Bonus points:
1. You're a pet lover + have them with you.
2. You're officially single & absolutely healed (so we can talk anytime without restrictions/being judged by someone on grounds of loyalty).
3. You're somewhere from Delhi NCR/Rajasthan (Just in case if we wanna take it further to irl).

Now, if you have reached to this point; it's mandatory for you to tell me. What name you like to be called by? And definitely, not asking for your real name, Cindrella.

See you on the other side with a cup of coffee, music and your story (Ms. Talkative). 😉

1or0uxa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1or0uxa,"Newbie solo ""camping"" (in a camper cabin)","I'm still very new to this (and middle aged) but really wanted to get back out after my last camping trip. I don't have gear to stay warm in the low 40s at night (don't even own long underwear) so instead of taking my tent I booked 2 nights in a camper cabin at a state park. It had no indoor plumbing, but that was the only thing that was even remotely ""camping"" - was new and had heat, a/c, and even a mini fridge and microwave. Super nice.

I had a few goals:

* Start a fire (had trouble last time)
* Cook something on the new propane stove
* See if I can sleep in the new sleeping bag (I've never liked them)
* Most important and the entire point of the trip: have morning coffee gazing out over a body of water

Success all round. :) Well I still don't really like sleeping bags but they have improved since last time I was in one, so it was OK. And I lit fires many times as a kid (we had a wood stove) so couldn't figure out why I couldn't do it last trip - then I remembered we used to use ""lighterd"" (sapwood kindling). Anyway this time I cheated and got fire starters - those cylinders made of pine shavings and wax - and packaged kindling from the grocery store. Most of y'all already know this, but for other newbies, that is the way to go. Just one match each night, no problem.

So for next time I have to arrange (1) a dishwashing setup (other than pouring water out of a pitcher over each individual thing over some underbrush), (2) better outdoor lighting, and (3) maybe some camping cookware. One of the kids was not happy that I had taken the kettle and her favorite pot :)

And coffee in silence on the dock (in my $10 chair from the sporting goods store) was sublime. ",24,1762537111.0,womensolocamping,4,1.0,False

1or0ue1,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1or0ue1/eleven_roasters_told_us_what_they_really_think/,Eleven roasters told us what they really think about tariffs on coffee,"Hey friends! We recently did a survey with roasters about how rising costs are affecting their businesses. Two questions were about tariffs in particular, and we decided to round up those answers for this focused story.

([original article](https://freshcup.com/eleven-roasters-say-what-they-really-think-about-coffee-tariffs/), for reference)

https://preview.redd.it/vaho6iabfvzf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2267be465e93a1c4f9733f95b0878bea87e4154



For many roasters, the chaos that followed “Liberation Day”—April 2, 2025—has yet to dissipate. That was the day the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on virtually all imported goods from most countries around the world. (Perhaps most comical and confounding were the tariffs placed on goods from a string of islands near Antarctica, which are [inhabited only by penguins](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/donald-trump-tariffs-antarctica-uninhabited-heard-mcdonald-islands).) 

The administration used words like “universal” and “sweeping” ahead of the tariff announcement to describe their scope, but many believed that coffee—a product that is primarily grown outside the United States—would be exempt. 

That exemption never came to pass. On Liberation Day, the White House announced that goods from Vietnam, the world’s largest grower of robusta coffee, would be tariffed at 46%; that imports from Indonesia would face 32% tariffs; and that just about everywhere else, including coffee-producing countries like Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, would get slapped with a baseline 10% tariff. 

After April 2, tariff talks yo-yoed from one extreme to the next, leaving roasters—and everyone else in the coffee industry—in limbo while they waited for definitive guidance. In August, President Trump announced an additional 40% tariff on Brazilian goods, bringing up the country’s tariff rate to 50%.

Soon after, a federal appeals court ruled that [a majority of Trump’s tariffs might be illegal](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/29/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-major-chunk-of-trumps-tariffs-00537643). Did that even matter when, in October, [the Senate passed a bill to strike down tariffs imposed on Brazilian goods](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-passes-bill-terminate-trump-tariffs-against-brazil-2025-10-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)? On top of that, the House and Senate [have both introduced bipartisan bills to exempt coffee from tariffs](https://freshcup.com/us-commerce-secretary-signals-possible-tariff-exemption-for-coffee/), leaving everyone wondering: *What the heck is going on?* 

Importing coffee is a process that takes months—sometimes even years—and the ambiguity around tariffs makes planning menus and sourcing beans nearly impossible. Seven months into this rollercoaster, we checked in with 11 [RoasterLink](https://freshcup.com/introducing-roasterlink-connecting-coffee-roasters-and-wholesale-buyers/) participants to see how tariffs are shaping their outlook

We asked: How does the current tariff situation make you feel about the state of roasting and the direction of your business? Here’s what they had to say:

**Rick Evans, CEO at** [**Evans Brothers Coffee Roasters**](https://evansbrotherscoffee.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq5NeOEBEXs1zdPWDu9hVgokO8LZCK8o31BRy4miUvt6JC4wZUD)**, Idaho**

*The current tariff situation (on top of already record-high green coffee costs) is the biggest challenge in our 17 years. It is extremely difficult to run any small business in this environment, and I believe coffee is currently among the most difficult. The situation SUCKS.*

**Mark Johnson, CEO at** [**Intent Coffee Roasting**](https://www.intentroasting.com/)**, Oregon**

*Frustrating, because we are already paying taxes. It is pointless, and makes everything harder. It sucks being taxed twice on one product and seeing the administration celebrating that they are making more money off U.S. citizens and specifically small business owners.* 

**Erin Halloran, senior account manager at** [**Driven Coffee Roasters**](https://www.drivencoffee.com/)**, Minnesota**

*It definitely feels like a pointless burden that is passed on to roasters and ultimately customers in the form of increased prices. There is no argument to justify a tariff on things that cannot physically be produced in the country. We have had to broaden our importer relationships. This leads to increased time chasing coffees, sample roasting, and cupping endlessly to find the diamonds in the rough, and ultimately it has been a catalyst to further direct-trade relationships.* 

**Andy Newbom, founder at** [**Torque Coffee**](https://torque.coffee/)**, California**

*It’s draconian taxation without representation by a fascist dictator who wants to be emperor. It hurts everyone except the wealthy who get richer and richer. Because of our business model* \[a proportional pricing system, which lets Torque set retail prices so producers always receive 20% of the retail price as free on board (FOB) payment\]*, we have not been affected by the green coffee shortages as much. But when the dictator starts throwing 50–100% tariffs on coffee, there ain’t no recovery from that.*

**Matt Marietti, president at** [**De Fer Coffee & Tea**](https://www.defer.coffee/)**, Pennsylvania**

*The tariff situation worries me less than the other factors contributing to rising coffee costs— environmental factors and inflation across the board. Tariffs are self-imposed costs—I am hopeful that common sense will prevail and we can unwind a lot of them as time goes on and it becomes more apparent they are not helpful, ESPECIALLY for a product with no real domestic substitutes. I worry more about all of the other things driving costs up that we cannot control with legislation.* 

**Jassen Bluto, owner and head roaster at** [**Half Mile Coffee**](https://halfmilecoffee.com/)**, Idaho**

*The tariffs at 10% do not, in my opinion, drive prices higher. This is caused by the news cycle and daily market fluctuation in C prices, which bring in commodity day traders and bots, which puts the market in turbulence. Although, in some instances, I support tariffs to bring some manufacturing back to the U.S., for coffee it is not helpful because most consuming countries cannot produce to the demand. Ultimately, tariffs are paid by consumers, not producers.* 

**Sam Meyer, retail and roasting operations at** [**Friedrichs Coffee**](https://friedrichscoffee.com/)**, Iowa**

*It’s hard to get into the politics of it. We just take what’s in front of us and handle it the best we can. Our relationships with our wholesale partners have definitely paid off, as we haven’t lost any partners this year.*

**Zachary Ray, CEO At** [**Desert Sun Coffee Roasters**](https://desertsuncoffee.com/)**, Colorado**

*The roasting business is challenging. We don’t roast coffee to sell coffee. We roast coffee to help producers live a better life, and make a positive contribution to the environment. The result is a great cup. We’re brewing a better future and hope to do so for the next 100 years!*

**Fred Spreen, founder at** [**Mecklenburg Coffee Company**](https://www.mecklenburgcoffeeco.com/)**, North Carolina**

*Fortunately, Americans love their coffee. However, with coffee drink prices nearing $7 for more complicated concoctions, many people seem to be rediscovering home-brewed coffee. Have no fear.*

**Peter Deo, COO at** [**C&S Coffee Roasters**](http://www.cscoffeeroasters.com/)**, Illinois**

*Essentially, it is a tax on the consumer—and we do not see any redeeming quality for the roaster or consumer. It is not a product that can be grown in the U.S., so roasters are very limited for procurement options. The price volatility fueled by the market and tariffs will drive smaller roasters out of business, in addition to bankrupting farmers at origin. Let’s keep in mind this will hurt the already most vulnerable in our society.* 

**Samuel Bender, CEO at** [**Peaks Coffee Company**](https://www.peakscoffeeco.com/)**, New York**

*It’s pointless to me. The U.S. can’t actually grow coffee in any sort of volume or pricing. We’re having to buy cheaper coffees and different origins to meet demand.*",4,1762537077.0,coffee_roasters,3,1.0,False

> Before you click ""add to cart,"" ask yourself these three questions. They are the secret to a thoughtful gift every single time.
>
> 1.  **What has she mentioned recently (even in passing)?** Has she talked about how cold her hands are? How her favorite necklace broke? How she'd love to learn pottery? *That's gold.*
> 2.  **What does she do to relax and unwind?** This tells you about her passions and what makes her happy. Is it a bubble bath, a hike, or a video game session?
> 3.  **What's an inside joke or a core memory we share?** The most personal gifts are often tied to a unique moment that only the two of you understand.

Answering these will immediately narrow down your options and point you toward a gift that feels personal, not just purchased.

Everything moved fast and after 3 months of dating long distance, he proposed and got married in the U.S. 

Because he didnt have a normal family, he built his circle/family with all his friends. Friends he hasn't seen since he moved to the U.S.

My husband feels very lonely at times and it made him fall into a depression that dragged me down with him. He is now going to therapy and is on anti-depression meds and he is almost back to how he was before. The thing is, he is quite literally desperate for friends and to build a community of friends here. I keep explaining to him that he needs to first focus on his family, then his career, and the friends will eventually come. We have argued because it feels no matter what, he will not let this go and is now interfering with our relationship. 

For example, he went out with his group of friends one night and did cocaine with them. I do not do drugs (besides gummies to sleep) so I was shocked when I found out. He apologized about it and hasn't done it since. Another example, he has been working 6 days a week and I only see him in the mornings for about 10 mins and at night, if I am awake, for another half hour or so. In his ONLY day off, he tells me he has a friend date. This infuriated me and disappointed me all at once. He does not understand that I miss him and want to spend time with him. He says he isnt doing anything wrong with them, and he has gone out for coffee or gym dates before yesterday and after the cocaine incident, and I have been supportive of this. 

He feels I am trying to control him, and if that is the case, please be honest with me about this, but do not be harsh or impolite, please 🤗

Chapter 1
“Mr. Bennett, I have decided to hand over my patent and join the Helix Institute of Medical Research.”

Dean Bennett rose to his feet, his face lighting up with excitement.

“That is incredible, Evelyn. This patent of yours could save hundreds and thousands of patients.”

“However, Helix Institute is a classified facility. You would need to disappear from public records for at least three years. You would leave in ten days.”

“Do you not want to discuss this with your boyfriend or your family first?”

“That will not be necessary.”

A bitter smile touched Evelyn’s lips.

There was no place for her in that house anymore.

Last year, Nina Wells, the so-called charity case her family had supported, lost her parents in a car accident and was taken in by her father.

Unlike Evelyn, who kept to herself and worked in silence, Nina knew exactly how to win people over.

In less than a year, she became the darling of the Hartley estate.

Not only did Greg Hartley treat her like a treasure, even Evelyn’s childhood fiancé and her younger brother adored her.

Nina shattered the framed photo of Evelyn’s mother.

But Greg insisted the past should be forgotten and removed the entire memorial shelf.

Nina even set her sights on the heart stent patent Evelyn had developed in memory of her mother.

To pressure her, Evan Miles, the boy who had grown up beside her and promised to love her forever, threatened to break up if she did not give in.

Blood ties and a lifetime of affection were no match for Nina’s well-practiced lies.

Evelyn was tired of fighting.

Leaving was the only way she could save herself.

---

She returned home.

The dining room overflowed with joy, a stark contrast to her lonely presence at the door.

The family was celebrating Nina’s one-year anniversary of joining the Hartleys.

No one remembered that it was also Evelyn’s birthday.

Since her mother passed away, no one had ever given her a birthday gift. No one celebrated her day at all.

Her eyes fell upon Evan and Zack. One sat on each side of Nina, smiling at her with gentle warmth as they handed her presents.

Not a flicker of emotion crossed Evelyn’s still and expressionless face.

She tried to walk past the room.

Greg called her. “I asked you to speak to the dean and transfer your patent to Nina. Did you do it?”

Evelyn shook her head. “The patent is no longer mine.”

The others misunderstood instantly, assuming she had finally agreed.

Evan pulled Nina into a joyful hug.

“That is amazing. This is a national level patent. With it, your future education and career will be smooth sailing. Congratulations.”

Evelyn watched coldly and turned to leave.

Nina cut a slice of peanut butter cupcake and brought it to her with a sweet smile.

“Evelyn, thank you for everything you have done for me. This is for you.”

With her back turned to the others, Nina’s face shifted. The sweetness vanished.

A triumphant challenge flashed in her eyes.

It was the look of a victor claiming her prize.

Evelyn’s gaze turned icy. “Take it away. I don’t want it.”

Two days ago, they had received their medical exam results together.

No one else knew about her peanut allergy. Only Nina did.

“Why are you angry with her, Evelyn. I was the one who told you to give her the patent. If you are upset, be upset with me.” Evan stood and glared at her with chilling reproach.

Tears welled in Nina’s eyes, her voice trembling.

“Evan, please don’t blame Evelyn. If anyone should be blamed, blame me. Nothing in this house ever belonged to me.”

“I know Evelyn always disliked my things. I am sorry.”

“If she does not want me here, I can move out tonight. I do not want to be a burden. I only want to repay Mr. Hartley for taking me in. I am sorry.”

“This is your home, Nina. Nobody gets to push you out.” Zack immediately grabbed her hand protectively.

Greg slammed his fork down on the table.

“Everyone was happy until you walked in here and ruined it. When will you learn any manners.”

“How did I end up with a daughter so narrow-minded and ill-mannered? Eat the cake right now and apologize to Nina.”

His eyes brimmed with disgust.

Even though Evelyn had already chosen to leave this cruel home, her fingers trembled. Her chest tightened as if a giant fist had seized her heart.

She forced her voice out between clenched teeth. “What if I refuse.”

The answer came in the form of a stinging slap.

Before she could react, Greg grabbed the cupcake and shoved it into her mouth in a violent rage.

The shock hit too fast.

Her lips went numb. Her breath faltered.

Her legs gave out and she collapsed onto the floor.

Nina pressed a hand to her chest in a show of feigned concern.

“Evelyn, what is wrong. Should I call an ambulance for you.”

“Leave her. She is pretending. Carry on with the celebration.”

Voices blurred into meaningless noise.

Evelyn dragged herself back to her bedroom, barely conscious.

She opened a drawer, found her medication, swallowed it with shaking hands, then dialed emergency services with the last of her strength.

Her gaze locked emptily on the ceiling.

Soon. Ten more days.

She would leave this frozen house.

She would leave these rotten people behind.

Family by blood yet strangers in spirit.

A first love filled with deceit.

She wanted none of it anymore.

Chapter 2
At some point, Evelyn drifted into unconsciousness.

Lost in that haze, she dreamed.

She was back in middle school, the day her article was published in a medical journal.

She rushed home with the magazine, thrilled beyond measure.

Her family took one glance, could not understand a word, and tossed it aside.

Only her mother read it carefully. She stroked Evelyn’s hair, her eyes filled with love as she praised her.

Curious, Evelyn asked if her mother could really understand a medical journal.

Her mother shook her head. Her voice was as gentle as a spring breeze.

“I cannot understand what you wrote, but I recognize the name printed at the beginning.”

Evelyn remembered that afternoon for years.

These days, her research appeared in journal after journal.

Yet the person who once patted her head and praised her work was gone forever.

“Mom…” When Evelyn opened her eyes, the traces of her tears were still visible.

The first thing she saw was the anxious face of a young man.

It was Noah Carter, the younger classmate currently interning at St. Aurora Medical Center.

“Evelyn, your family is unbelievably heartless.” His voice trembled with anger.

“The paramedics said you were nearly dead, and they kept on celebrating without even checking on you.”

“You were unconscious for two days, and not a single person came to see you.”

His frustration only met Evelyn’s blank expression.

Her lack of response hit Noah harder than any outburst ever could.

There was no grief greater than a heart that had already gone cold.

This must have been what that looked like.

“I bought some soup. Try to eat a little.”

Before she could refuse, Noah scooped up a spoonful of the chicken soup and held it to her lips. Evelyn had no choice but to eat.

Slowly, Noah’s figure overlapped with another from her memories.

Right after her mother died, Evelyn had clung to the framed photograph of her mother, refusing to eat, drink, or go to school.

Greg lost his temper and whipped her with a belt until her small body was covered in bruises.

Even Zack hid in a corner, too frightened to make a sound.

Evan had rushed into the Hartley estate then.

He shielded her with his thin body. He took her home and fed her by hand.

Back then, Evan was a beacon of light in her dark world.

She never imagined that the boy who once vowed to spend his life with her would one day fall in love with someone else.

“Evelyn,” his voice was icy, “who is he?”

The cold voice snapped Evelyn from her thoughts.

Evan stood at the door of the hospital room, his expression sour.

He had already decided to leave Evelyn behind for Nina.

Yet the sight of Noah gently feeding her stirred something sharp and uncomfortable inside him.

As if something that belonged to him was being stolen.

Noah opened his mouth to explain.

Evan did not give him the chance. He stormed forward and slapped the bowl away.

The porcelain shattered across the room.

A shard sliced Evelyn’s arm.

Blood welled out fast and bright.

She flinched at the sting.

Evan did not spare her a glance.

His dark, furious gaze pinned Noah in place as he growled a single order. “Get out.”

His tone was so possessive it seemed to twist the very air in the room.

Evelyn seemed to be nothing more than a toy he refused to let others touch.

He did not stay long.

His phone rang. He glanced at the screen and his face changed.

“Nina is drowning in guilt. Her depression got worse, and she tried to overdose.”

“I need to stay with her while they pump her stomach. I will come back to see you later, alright.”

There was no room for agreement.

He informed her he was leaving.

Clutching her bleeding arm, Evelyn looked at his indifferent face and let out a soft, broken laugh. “Sure.”

What was left to grieve.

Evan, in eight days, you will never have to pretend again.

Chapter 3
Evelyn’s hollow gaze met Evan’s. His eyes wavered, a flicker of guilt crossing his face.

Once he remembered that Nina was also in the hospital, he clenched his teeth and turned away without hesitation.

Noah stood frozen.

He had admired Evelyn from afar for a long time.

He’d always heard she was deeply in love with her childhood sweetheart, which is why he had quietly buried his own feelings and simply wished for her happiness.

That thought now seemed utterly ridiculous to him.

He once envied this man he had never met.

He never imagined that when Evelyn needed someone the most, that man would leave her alone to care for another woman.

Her wound continued to bleed.

She looked as if she felt nothing.

Noah’s heart ached, a painful lump forming in his throat.

He could not fathom how deeply Evan must have scarred her to turn a bright, sunny girl into someone so hollow.

“Evelyn, I will get bandages and take care of this.”

After he had cleaned and bandaged the wound, Evelyn asked him to help her with the discharge paperwork.

As she was about to leave, Noah gently stopped her.

He knew the Hartley estate was no longer a home to her.

“You can stay here for a few days if you’d like,” he offered. “I can look after you. You shouldn’t have to go through this alone.”

Evelyn simply smiled and shook her head.

She refused to drag Noah into the mess of her life.

One person suffering was more than enough.

When she returned to the Hartley estate, Greg had sent her a message.

It informed her that they wouldn’t be coming home that night because Nina had just had her stomach pumped and needed care.

He added that there was food left for her in the kitchen.

On the dining table sat a few plates of wilted vegetables, chunks of fatty meat, and cold soup.

They were not meals left for her.

They were Nina’s leftovers.

Evelyn showed no reaction. She had grown too used to this.

From the moment Nina arrived, Greg seemed desperate to make up for every hardship she had faced growing up in a poor rural town.

Any good food always went to Nina first.

Evelyn was older and should understand. She should give everything up for Nina without complaint.

Evelyn had never been one to fight for things. She could only watch as Nina took everything away.

Even her former bedroom now belonged to Nina.

Evelyn lived in the drafty attic on a hard wooden bed.

In Greg’s eyes, a sweet-talking, flattering girl like Nina was the perfect daughter.

The front door opened.

Zack stepped inside carrying a shopping bag. He froze when he saw Evelyn, then frowned like he had seen something dirty.

“I came back for Nina’s toiletries. Also, Evan wanted me to tell you the two of you are done.”

“He wishes you well. Nina’s depression came back again, so he cannot leave her side.”

Zack took out a small recorder and handed it to her.

“This is yours. He said to give it back to you.”

Evelyn stared at the familiar object.

It was the first gift she had ever given Evan.

Back then, she had little money of her own.

She had saved her breakfast allowance for half a year just to buy this recorder, and then recorded all his favorite songs onto it.

She remembered the tears in his eyes as he hugged her.

He had promised to cherish it for a lifetime. Now, he had forgotten that promise.

He did not even bother to give it back himself.

Chapter 4
A trace of bitter mockery flickered in Evelyn’s eyes.

With her heart already turned to dust, she held no more expectations for Evan.

She spoke calmly, only three words. “I understand.”

Zack stared at her in disbelief.

“Evan took such good care of you back then, and that’s all the feeling you have for him?”

“Ever since Mom passed, you’ve become so strange.”

“Nina nearly died because of what you did, and you still haven’t said one word of concern.”

“Oh, I get it now. You blame Nina for stealing everyone’s attention from you. You wish she had died, don’t you?”

“She’s already had such a tragic life, yet you still envy her. When did you become so cruel?”

At that, Evelyn almost wanted to laugh.

If Nina truly intended to swallow pills and die, why would she control the dosage so precisely, just enough to be discovered in time?

For years, Nina had used these same cheap tricks to steal every bit of affection in this household. Evelyn had long grown numb to it.

Offering an explanation was pointless. Yet remaining silent was also treated as a crime.

As he walked out, Zack’s voice was icy, the tone of someone who had lost all hope in her.

“Do you know what I wish? I wish that car accident… I wish the one who gave me blood had been you instead of Nina.”

“You’re my real sister. Yet when I was dying, you ran away. I hate you.”

A harsh slam of the door.

Zack left without looking back.

Half a year ago, Zack had been hit by a drunk driver.

He had lost a critical amount of blood, and his life was hanging by a thread.

The hospital’s blood supply was running out.

He still needed 1,400 milliliters.

Greg and Evelyn were supposed to both donate to save him.

But Greg only managed 200 milliliters before he started shouting that he couldn’t take it anymore and demanded the doctor remove the needle.

Evelyn began to lose consciousness after 800 milliliters.

Yet for the little brother lying helpless on that operating table, she gritted her teeth and forced herself to endure.

She held on until they drew the full 1,200 milliliters from her.

When she finally came to, she found herself in an unfamiliar, shabby hospital room. She was completely alone.

Later she learned the truth.

To help Zack build a bond with Nina, Greg claimed that Nina was the one who donated blood to save him.

After being discharged, Evelyn dragged her weak body to explain everything to Zack.

All she received was a slap across the face.

He was crying and screaming, accusing her of abandoning him when he was at his most vulnerable.

Why Nina had to donate so much blood that she nearly died.

Evelyn swallowed the pain and told him to check the hospital records.

He would know the truth.

Yet he never looked. Not once.

Instead, he firmly believed that twenty percent of the blood in his veins came from Nina.

In his mind, his sister was a selfish monster who left him to die.

Everything she did was malicious. Every word she said, a scheme.

Fine. She was done explaining.

She was done hurting.

Evelyn sat on the sofa.

The entire Hartley estate felt hollow, devoid of even the faintest warmth of home.

The wind moaned outside the window.

She closed her eyes and covered her ears, but she could not block out the heavy, oppressive silence that seemed to crush the very air from her lungs.

No one in this house cared if she lived or died. No one needed her here.

If that was so… Perhaps she should disappear forever.

Chapter 5
Her phone buzzed.

Nina had posted a cheerful update online.

[Thank you for worrying about me. I’m okay now. Thank you Evan for always staying with me whenever I need you. I will spend the rest of my life repaying you.]

The attached photo showed Nina in a hospital bed, fingers intertwined with Evan.

They looked so perfect together.

Evelyn only skimmed it before switching off her phone and putting it aside.

She and Evan were over.

Whether Nina meant to show off or provoke her, none of it mattered anymore.

No jealousy, no heartbreak, nothing.

She cooked a proper, warm dinner for herself and went to bed early.

With the house entirely empty, she had the most peaceful sleep she had in years.

The next morning, Evelyn made herself a cup of freshly ground coffee.

Settling into a wicker chair in the yard with a cup of freshly ground coffee, she listened to the morning radio and stretched her limbs.

Years of suffocating under family burdens finally loosened their grip.

For the first time, she enjoyed simply being alive.

She should have lived for herself long ago.

After breakfast, Evelyn returned to her room, planning to gather every gift Evan had ever given her to return them.

But sorting through them made her realize how pitifully few there were—just handful of cheap, worthless trinkets.

Yet she used to guard each one like treasure, locking them carefully away.

Now that she took them out again, they were yellowed, moldy, ruined with time.

A fitting metaphor for Evan’s withered affection.

Evelyn shook her head.

Evan hated dirt. Even if she returned these, he wouldn’t want them.

So she threw everything into a metal barrel.

Every gift. Every photo of them together.

All of it. She lit a match.

Flames roared upward, devouring every memory that once felt precious.

When she finished, she went to the university and applied for a leave of absence.

She decided to spend her remaining days on a short trip, hoping the change of scenery would clear her mind.

She was scrolling through travel guides when Evan showed up.

Unlike her calm demeanor, he had spent a sleepless night.

Zack had told him that Evelyn reacted with no emotion at all when she received the returned patent materials.

Evan, who knew better than anyone the depth of her past devotion, refused to believe her indifference was genuine.

Yet standing before the charred barrel in the courtyard, seeing the burned scraps of their gifts and photos, his world seemed to collapse.

Those things used to be priceless to her.

Now they meant less than garbage.

“Why did you burn everything I gave you? Our photos too?”

His voice trembled slightly.

Evelyn lifted her eyes and looked at his pale face.

“They were moldy. So I burned them.”

Evan froze. Then his expression shifted as if he had solved a riddle.

“You knew I would come. You staged all of this on purpose to get my attention.”

“You are trying to win me back in some roundabout way, aren’t you?”

“Evelyn, why must you always be so unreasonable?”

He was about to storm out when a document on the coffee table caught his eye.

Her leave of absence form.

His mind blanked.

“You’re taking time off school? Just because we told you to give the patent to Nina?”

“Say something. Where are you going?”

A sudden, inexplicable panic seized him. His hand shot out and closed tightly around her arm.

Even though Evelyn stood right before him, tangible and real, a terrifying thought clawed at him.

She might vanish forever.

Chapter 6
Evelyn wasn’t ready to reveal the truth just yet.

“I’m a little tired. I’m taking a few days off school to travel nearby. I won’t go far,” she said, showing him the travel guide she had been reading.

Seeing the guide, Evan relaxed slightly and let go of her arm.

“That’s good. I knew you weren’t that petty. It’s just a patent. You can make another one next time.”

At that moment, his phone rang.

It was Zack calling from the hospital.

“Evan, where are you? Nina woke up and didn’t see you by her side.”

“She’s having another episode, hitting the wall, bleeding all over. You need to come right now.”

Evan hurried to leave but still turned to give her a reminder.

“Go enjoy your trip, just don’t wander too far.”

Evelyn smiled silently.

Don’t worry, she thought, it won’t be far. Just far enough to beyond your reach.

Passing through the yard, Evan’s eyes fell upon the pile of unrecognizable ash. A pang of unease twisted inside him.

But he quickly let it go.

If Evelyn could be so cold-hearted, then he had no reason to feel guilty about anything.

Yet, for some reason, a nagging feeling lingered.

She was hiding something from him.

“Stop overthinking. Where could she possibly go?” Evan murmured.

“Right now, taking care of Nina is more important. I can’t be distracted.”

Thinking of Nina, Evan turned and left Evelyn behind without another glance.

Over the next few days, Evelyn joined a tour group, visiting all the famous sights in the city.

Her companions were peers her own age, and the atmosphere was cheerful.

They watched sunsets from mountain peaks, sang beneath a canopy of stars, and shared stories over a barbecue.

Here, free from the chains of family and love, she realized more than ever—people ultimately live for themselves.

The final stop of her trip was a high-end garden café.

Evelyn had just chosen a seat by the window, preparing to enjoy the afternoon quietly, when someone entered.

It was Nina.

Today was also Nina’s discharge day.

The entire family had gathered to celebrate her discharge.

They occupied the most prominent table in the place, surrounded by champagne, gifts, and cake.

Everything Evelyn had never possessed was now laid before Nina like a little princess’s feast, ready to be claimed.

Seeing Greg pour Nina a glass of wine, Evan looked concerned.

“Uncle Greg, she just got out of the hospital. Don’t let her drink.”

“Then what’s the point of good champagne if no one shares it with me? Tell you what, Evan, you drink a few glasses in her place.”

“Don’t worry about me, just a little is fine,” Nina whispered softly near Evan’s ear.

“Uncle Greg is happy today. I don’t want to ruin it. Let me have this.”

Their intimate demeanor made them appear to everyone as a couple growing closer by the moment.

Zack immediately started egging them on. “Well, if you won’t let her drink, then you two should kiss instead!”

Greg’s eyes lit up. “Yes, yes, kiss! Then I won’t make her drink.”

Nina’s cheeks flushed crimson.

She didn’t refuse. Instead, she glanced at Evan.

The charm in her eyes, the slight lift of her chin, seemed like an invitation.

She was waiting for something.

Evan felt parched under the heat of her gaze. Hesitation gripped him.

Then, Nina moved closer, pressing her lips onto his.

Evan had not expected her boldness and instinctively tried to push her away.

But when the warmth of her soft, yielding body pressed against him, he finally succumbed to her advances, breath quickening as he responded.

Chapter 7
Back then, she had only stolen a quick kiss on his cheek in front of their friends without asking.

He got angry and ignored her for days.

So, she realized with a sickening clarity, Evan was never actually reserved.

He had simply been cold and unresponsive with her.

A wave of nausea hit her. She pushed herself up and walked out.

As she reached the door, Evan noticed her and jerked away from Nina in panic.

It was only then that everyone realized she had been there the whole time.

She stepped out of the restaurant. Nina came rushing out after her and seized her by the shoulder.

“Evelyn, wait! It’s not what you think!”

“Let go.” Evelyn frowned, not wanting to hear a single word.

Yet Nina tightened her grip. Her fingers dug deeper.

“If I fall here, do you think your family would believe you did not push me?”

The moment those words left her lips, she let out a dramatic scream.

Nina flung herself backward and crashed into the restaurant’s glass wall. It shattered with a thundering crack.

The commotion brought the Hartley family rushing out, they saw Nina sprawled among the shards.

Blood streamed down her forehead and cuts covered her arms.

“Evelyn, have you lost your mind? Were you trying to kill her?” Zack shouted and dropped to his knees to hold Nina tightly.

Evelyn had not even spoken when Greg stormed over and slapped her across the face.

“You vicious girl!”

Her body hit the floor. Blood mixed with a broken tooth spilled from her mouth.

She tried to open her lips to explain, but all she met were hostile eyes filled with rage and disgust.

Their gazes felt like they could flay her alive.

The explanations she might have offered withered, unspoken, in her throat.

Her own family would only believe Nina. Anything Evelyn said became a lie, a crime, an unforgivable sin.

Nestled in Zack’s arms, Nina choked out sobs. “Evelyn, if you hated me, you could have just told me. I would disappear forever.”

“If you think I stole Evan from you, I will give him back. I only want you to be happy. Please do not hit me anymore.”

Nina’s performance was so convincing it brought the entire Hartley family to the verge of tears.

“You did this because you think she stole me from you?” Evan stared at Evelyn in disbelief.

She met his eyes blankly. Then a laugh bubbled out with blood on her lips.

It was the kind of laugh that comes only when a heart had been frozen solid and then shattered—the sound of despair tipping into madness.

The sight of her laughing at a time like this extinguished the last flicker of feeling Evan had for her.

“You know what?” he said, his voice low and venomous.

“I don’t hate you. I hate my past self. I hate that blind fool who actually loved a vicious woman like you.”

“You deserve to die. I wish you were dead right now.”

He left with those words still hanging in the air.

He scooped Nina up and followed the Hartleys out to the hospital.

As their backs grew distant, Evelyn could not stop laughing.

Passersby stared and whispered among themselves, convinced she had lost her mind.

She lay there for a long time, unable to get up. Her heart had torn apart completely, riddled with holes that would never feel pain again.

Her dark eyes held no anger and no resentment. Only a numb indifference remained.

It no longer mattered. In three days, none of them would ever see this disgrace of a daughter again.

When she finally returned to the Hartley estate, the bursts of laughter inside abruptly ended.

Every gaze on her face carried the same message—how dare you come back?

It was as if they look one might give a wounded stray dog that had been kicked out to die, only to watch it drag its broken body back to the doorstep.

Chapter 8
Evelyn ignored everyone and retreated to the attic—her private little sanctuary—where she tended to her wounds alone.

When she was finished, she lay on the bed, her gaze empty, fixed on the ink-black night sky outside.

She willed time to move faster. She ached to break free from this cold-hearted household.

Over the next three days, the Hartleys busied themselves with preparations for Nina’s college admission dinner gala.

Greg’s fondness for her was so great that he announced plans to formally adopt her, declaring publicly that she was a hundred times the daughter his own flesh and blood had never been.

On the day of the gala, Greg, who had never once attended a parent-teacher conference for Evelyn, shocked everyone by donning an expensive, custom-tailored suit.

No one thought to invite Evelyn. It was as if everyone had forgotten she existed.

Before leaving, Nina knocked on the attic door. Her face no longer carried that usual meek, obedient look.

“Evelyn, get on your feet and beg me.”

“I can make Dad forgive you, you know.”

Evelyn remained unmoved.

Nina’s lips curled in triumph.

“You know, you’re better than me at everything. Except for one thing.”

“You don’t know how to debase yourself and flatter those around you.”

“So all you’re fit to do is stand by and watch as I take everything from you. Your lover, your family, even your precious patent.”

“I’m curious, how can you still live, like a dog, without dying? Isn’t it amusing?”

Nina kept talking, unafraid that anyone would report her words.

Nothing Evelyn said held any weight anymore—no one would believe a word of it.

It was only when Zack came to summon her that she finally left the attic to join the Hartleys at the gala.

After Nina left, Evelyn retrieved a running tape recorder from under her bed and gently pressed Stop Recording.

Today was also the day she would leave this city.

Before departing, she wanted her family to witness with their own eyes the kind of evil flower they had nurtured.

Half an hour later, the car from Helix Institute of Medical Research arrived.

Seeing that Evelyn had brought only her mother’s framed photo, the staff were a bit surprised.

“We’re ready to depart. Are you sure you don’t need to pack anything else?”

“No need.”

Evelyn hugged the photo tightly, shaking her head. This was all she wanted to take.

At the airport, she sat in the departure lounge, basking in the warm sunlight. Here was the beginning of her rebirth.

At that moment, Evan called.

Yesterday, he had returned to that restaurant and checked the surveillance footage.

He finally realized that Nina had staged her own fall. Evelyn had nothing to do with it.

“Let’s meet up after the dinner. I... what I said was too much. I want to apologize.”

“Oh, and I missed your birthday last time—forgot because I was busy. This time, I’ve got your gift ready.”

He felt no apprehension. He knew Evelyn, or at least he though he did, and was certain she would forgive him.

No matter how angry she had been in the past, once he coaxed her, she always came back—without fail.

But this time, Evelyn did not say a word.

The eerie silence unsettled him.

The boarding announcement blared. It was time to go.

Evan’s face turned pale.

“Wait, what’s that sound? Where are you?”

Evelyn hung up, removed her SIM card, and snapped it in two.

She would no longer be swayed by false affection.

Whether it was her father, her brother, or even her childhood friend, she wanted nothing to do with any of them.

With that final thought, she walked toward her new future, never once looking back.",1,1762536860.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1or0qmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/mothuncle/comments/1or0qmm/something_is_pretending_to_be_me/,Something is pretending to be me,"Hey everyone, I need some help. I’m currently at a loss of what to do here. Something happened to me and my girlfriend last night and it’s just gotten more complicated since.

I should start with a few quick details. My girlfriend and I live together in a small house. Without going into specifics about our location, I’ll just say we live in a decently populated college town that’s not too far down the road from a major city. We’re not living in some desolate cabin in the woods or an old Victorian mansion - so that’s why this has especially caught us by surprise.

Last night, I came home from work. Nothing unordinary about that. I got inside and was taking off my coat when I sort of noticed the house was really quiet. My girlfriend - who I’ll call June after her birth month - usually has music or youtube going. It was just silent in there. So I walk back into our bedroom and that’s when I find June. She’s jammed herself into the far corner of the room and has tears in her eyes.

“Hey, what’s going on? What’s wrong?” I asked her.

“Don’t come any closer!” she hissed back at me.

I was extremely confused to say the least. I instinctively walk closer to try and comfort her. That’s when June reaches for a trophy on the shelf next to her and points it at me.

“I will cave your skull in! Not another step!”

“Baby, what’s going on? It’s just me!” I pleaded with her.

“No it’s not! You’re not him!”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

My mouth was hanging wide open. I couldn’t believe what was going on. All of this after a nine hour shift was a lot to take in. 

I didn’t understand much of anything at that moment, but I was beginning to gather June wasn’t entirely convinced I was me for some reason. She was clearly petrified of something and the hand she held the trophy in was shaking violently. I didn’t want her to bludgeon me with my own trophy. That’s when I thought to maybe say something that could prove I was me.

“Are you really gonna kill me with *my* tenth grade swimming team participant trophy?” I asked with obnoxious emphasis on each overly specific syllable, hoping that would prove something to her.

I saw June slowly glance at the trophy and read the engraved text facing her which couldn’t be seen from where I stood.

“It’s me, honey. I promise. Why don’t you just set that down and we can talk this over, okay?”

June stared at me for a little while longer before slowly disarming herself. With both arms limp by her side, she just started to sob uncontrollably.

“We have to leave first. Then I’ll try to tell you,” June said through sniffles.

We got out of there quickly, hopping in my car and driving back out into the night. The whole time, I was trying to get answers out of her. She would just sob in response.

I parked in a movie theater lot across town. It was raining out and the theater’s neon lights soaked the surrounding area in a comforting red and gold haze. June’s sobbing had eased up a little and I breathed a deep sigh.

“You’ve got to tell me what’s going on. Like, what happened? Cause right now, my mind’s jumping to the worst places. Like, do we need to call the police? Is the house safe? Did someone break in?” I asked with a firm tone. I needed to understand what was happening. “And why did you point a trophy at me and threaten to cave my skull in?”

“I didn’t know if you were you,” June whispered.

“What the fuck does that mean though?”

“You’re not going to believe me.”

“I seriously doubt that.”

June looked at me with crazed eyes and mascara streaming down her face. “You’re *not* going to believe me.”

“Please just tell me. You have to tell me.”

June tugged at her hair, moaning. Tears were still running effortlessly from her eyes like there was a leak somewhere inside. She looked away from me and out the window.

“I was sitting in bed, just waiting for you to come home. I was just watching some youtube or something. I saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I looked and saw something kinda like smoothly coming closer to the bedroom,” June said slowly as if each word could’ve resummoned something.

I wanted to ask her what “smoothly” meant but I didn’t want her to get lost in something so trivial.

“It’s still just a shadow at this point, but it’s definitely real. I see the shadow move closer and closer until it jumps from the floor to the wall and is still coming closer. I didn’t hear any sound at all. I paused my video and called out, asking if you were home. I didn’t hear the front door open though so I knew you couldn’t have been.”

June tried to hide inside herself. It took her a moment to return to what she was saying.

“The shadow kept creeping closer, still no sound. Then, I saw like an actual thing start peeking into the bedroom. I couldn’t make it out. I kept calling out to you, but I knew it wasn’t you. Then it just - it just floated into the bedroom. The entire thing. It floated in there. It looked like you. It had your coat on, your work uniform too. Your pants were even rolled up and I could see the socks you wore today were on it too. White socks with - with red stripes,” June spoke like there were glass shards in her throat.

I couldn’t believe what she was saying. Maybe it was, I don’t know. Maybe it was something wrong with the house, a leak of some kind that made her hallucinate. I don’t know.

June continued, “the face was mangled but I could tell it was supposed to be your face. Your general look but everything was all wrong. Your mouth - its mouth - drooped so low it might’ve been hanging off of its face, but it was smiling, or looked like it was trying to smile at me. The eyes were awful, like overly white cartoonish looking circles with a black hole in the middle. No red veins and no iris. Nothing was detailed. Not the clothes, not the shoes, none of it. Everything was just lacking texture, you know?”

I did not *know.* What she was describing was something impossible. A breakthrough or some kind of proof of the supernatural or something else, but whatever it was is something that would never happen to us. We were nobodies living in a nowhere town. It was impossible. I couldn’t contain my judgemental stare as she spoke. I contemplated her sanity and our future together. I’d have to have her committed somewhere, or we’d just have to break up or something extreme. Because this was extreme and I couldn’t help her if this was a product of her mind warping to some disorder I doubt we could work through.

June continued still, “it just looked at me for a few seconds. It felt like years. I got out of bed and pressed myself against the wall. It was - it was all wrong. One arm was longer than the other, its fingers were stuck out of a circular flesh ball at gross angles. The legs were not being used properly or at all, one of them looked like it had a knot in it. It was just - it was the worst thing I’ve ever seen. After a few seconds, it slowly turned away from me and hovered out of the room. It never made a sound. Like ten seconds later, I heard the front door open and you came in.”

There was a long silence in the car. I couldn’t talk and she had nothing more to say. She returned to crying while my mind tried to contort all of what she had said into a weapon that I could then use against her. It’s all I could think of to preserve reality. I was being a selfish jackass.

“I’m sorry that this happened to you. How have you been doing recently?” I asked, breaking the long silence. To me, what I said was as polite as I could piece together. I had successfully filtered all of the harsher and more abrasive things that were swirling around in my head and spoke something gentle and caring instead. To June, my question to her contained a break in trust. Something jagged hidden behind my kind words that let her know there was a question of her account and of her character.

“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”

“You know - mentally. Have you been struggling with anything?” I doubled down, because believing her meant there was a cheap copy of me gliding around our house at that moment.

It was an awful couple of hours in that cold car. We yelled at each other and said things that would be hard to take back. There was a divide formed between us. June was convinced she saw something pretending to be me and I had confirmed in my mind she was delusional for it. No longer the June I knew and loved. Yells and pauses and tears and hostility. At the end of it all, the only thing floating around between us was where to go from there. Where do we sleep tonight? We didn’t want to be together, but being alone felt worse somehow. At that moment, every fiber of me thought my girlfriend was crazy - but something in me did *not* want to go back to our house.

The movie theater’s neon lights had long been shut off, and we shivered in the dark together. The silence was a droning chorus of ugly thoughts. I finally turned on the car.

“You can just take me to a motel or something,” June broke the silence.

“Don’t be ridiculous.”

“I will *not* go back there.”

“Relax. We’re not gonna go back. Not tonight.”

I drove us through the silent streets until my eyelids felt like stone. We rested near the town’s college, in some sleepy district where the buildings looked like models. We slept in the car, and something in me was perfectly happy about that.

We were awoken early in the morning by a garbage truck slamming a dumpster down right next to my car. It was still dark.

Me and June sort of looked at each other and our eyes said enough.

“I’m sorry,” I said to her.

“I’m not crazy.”

“Okay. I believe you.”

I felt horrible about all the things I said in our argument. I still didn’t want to fully bend, though. There couldn’t be a crude version of me in our house. That’s just not something that happens. We had to go back home. Our whole life was there. Our cat, our belongings, my keycard for work which was in three hours. I was going in there because I had to prove the other me wasn’t real. Then, we could work on rebuilding. Whatever was wrong with June, we’d work through. We’d overcome it. The morning made me inspired to fix everything - even the things well beyond my control.

When I turned into our neighborhood, June wouldn’t have it. She thrashed around in the car and screamed at me.

“Turn around! Please!”

“Calm down! I’m just going to run in real quick!”

“No. Do not go in there. I won’t let you.”

“It’s gonna be just fine, you’ll see.”

“No! You can’t go back in there.”

We didn’t reach any compromise before the car was idle in front of our house. The house, now soaking in morning sunlight, felt more approachable and safe. June was not as easily disarmed.

“If you go in that house, you’re going to die. I just know it,” June said in a disturbingly calm way.

“I’m going to be okay. There’s nothing to worry about,” I said with deflating confidence. “I-I don’t have any interest in dying, okay? I just need my keycard for work and I’ll feed Larry while I’m at it.”

“If Larry is still there, please just bring him out here. Can you at least do that?”

“Sure. I’ll bring him out here - even if he scratches me to death in the process.”

I smiled softly at June and got out of the car.

I looked up at our house as I climbed our gravel driveway. I was only a few steps from the door when I realized every light in the house had been turned on. The TVs were blaring too, the volume must’ve been cranked to a hundred on the two we had.

Despite the oddness of that, I still didn’t think an entity was inside. More likely, I thought an intruder could be in there. I walked the entire perimeter of our small house a few times, looking in every window which pieced together a near-entire view of the place. I was confident I would’ve seen a person in there unless they were hiding in a closet.

I looped around to the front door and peered in one more time. I saw Larry looking at me on the coffee table. I spotted my keycard right next to him, too. I opened the door and stepped in.

The first thing I noticed was the noise of the TVs. They were unbearably loud, a shrieking infomercial and a distorted political talk show host clashing together into a horrible nausea. I turned the TV in the living room off and gave Larry a few pets before picking him up. I grabbed my key card and was ready to run out. That’s when I smelled something unusual.

It was a strange sort of metallic smell that was heavy in the air. Then Larry freaked out and sliced me open in three different places with his claws. He ran off into another room, keeping low. I inspected the damage he dealt me and went to go catch him.

I figured Larry was hiding in the bedroom and I walked in there. It reeked of the bloody scent in there. I looked under the bed and saw Larry wrapped into a tight ball far out of reach. I tried to call him but he wouldn’t budge. I got on the ground and crawled under the bed where I was able to get an arm around him. He started hissing at me which he never did. I grabbed him regardless. I was starting to regret coming inside.

I wrestled with Larry and eventually got him out from under the bed. That’s when I felt something in the room with me.

Larry scratched me again and even deeper, escaping out of the room and leaving me in there with it.

In the bedroom, floating silently above the bed, was something impossible. I still can’t comprehend it. I still barely believe in myself.

It was some awful imposter. It was pretending to be June. It was specifically June from last night when I came home from work. It looked like a horrific interpretation of her terrified face, its flesh mimicked her clothing crudely, altering its torso with some skin pigmentation to resemble her graphic tee but it did a terrible job of it. It had made little progress in the way of limbs, but the furthest along was a miserable excuse for an arm which held something boxy and golden. I think it was a fleshy parody of my swim team trophy that she threatened me with the night before.

It was the most sinister and disgusting and impossible thing I’ve ever seen. I felt all the color drain from me and I wasted no time getting out of there. It either let me leave or it hadn’t figured a way to trap me yet. It certainly was not convincing me by producing June’s likeness.

I ran down to the car, screaming like a maniac. I couldn’t find Larry again and I left my keycard behind, so my visit was all for nothing. 

June had to spend a few hours calming me down and tending to Larry’s deep slashes he left in my arms and neck. I was reduced to an infant for a while. I was pretty much just shocked at what I had seen, but June made me feel better about it over time. 

I still feel awful, so awful that I doubted her so passionately and that I thought such negative things about her when she was right all along. Now knowing what she had seen, it’s a miracle she didn’t up and leave me when I expressed doubt. I guess it’s impossible to imagine when you’ve never seen such a thing before.

We’ve been parked outside the movie theater all day, I have three missed calls and five long, unread texts from my boss. My arms are throbbing and both of our mental states are deteriorating. We don’t know what to do. We can’t go back there. We will not go back there. If you have any sort of advice or guidance you can offer us, anything would help right now. I know I probably sound like an insane person, but truthfully I’m just scared out of my mind. I’m scared that thing will find us and, if I see it again, it’ll be a more convincing rendition of June.",1,1762536847.0,mothuncle,0,1.0,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**

4 of the last 5 meetings between these two squads have cashed the Over – and they should do so again with ease this evening. Not only have the Raptors struggled immensely on defense, but both of these offenses love to play at a breakneck pace. Toronto & Atlanta have each put at least 117 points on the board in 3 of their last 4 outings, and I imagine this encounter will be a close one. My money’s on this matchup to go Over 236.

‎
‎I started using Facebook groups to build a local community not just for selling, but for connecting. Most people moving into my area of focus mostly don't know anyone outside their families. So I created a space where they could plug in.
‎
‎Here’s the play:
‎
‎I host casual local events (coffee meetups, vendor showcases, open house parties).
‎
‎At each event, I pass around a sign-up sheet name, email, phone. Then I ask if they want to join my newsletter. 99% say yes.
‎
‎I send 2-3 newsletters a month mostly value: market updates, renovation tips, and local deals. At the bottom? My latest flip.
‎
‎When someone joins Facebook group, I add them on my personal page and send a quick personalized welcome message.
‎
‎When someone buys a flip from me on the group, I ask them to post a testimonial in the Facebook group or platform they found they found me. That social proof is gold.
‎
‎
‎I keep promo light 10% me, 90% value. I share on similar groups, local news, events, even subreddits and small behind-the-scenes lessons from my projects.
‎
‎
‎To avoid renovation problems, I set up specific contractors for each type of job (roofing, electrical, flooring, etc.) instead of using one general crew. I found them through local Facebook groups, referrals from other flippers, and small local events the same network I sell through.
‎
‎
‎This helped me sell 10+ homes in a year no paid ads, fewer reno delays, and a strong local network.
‎
‎Hope it helps you as much as it did for me, just thought I’d share what’s been working for me lately. And I've been thinking of setting up a step by step guide flippers set it up, grow, automate and promote their own local group. Pls let me know if it's something you'd be interested in.

We're talking about getting trained on platforms like **HighLevel** and **Taskade** from day one, backed by 30+ years of industry mentorship.

In my fandom day, no one cared about the canon- we just slapped a big ol’ AU on our tag and that was the end of that. If something came up in the original story that invalidated our fics, all we did was change the tag to canon adjacent or canon non-compliant. You literally don’t have to change anything about your fics or fanart if canon counteracts it. Fan works are supposed to cater to you as the fan writer/artist so feel free to draw or write what you want.

Change the gender. Rearrange the plot. Rework the setting. Develop that ship. Demolish the timeline. Make them all die. Make them all live. Destroy their world and reshape it to a coffee shop au that has nothing to do with the source material- 

The point is fan works are essentially giant sandboxes to play with and there’s nothing wrong with exploring non-canon elements. Your aus and headcanons do not take away from the canon whatsoever. You’re not invalidating the canon by exploring a different idea. Canon will always exist so if others enjoy canon more then they’re welcome to, but you shouldn’t have to limit yourself to what’s canon in your own fanfics or fanart- you severely limit your creativity that way. 

You think spirk, the ship between Spock and Captain Kirk in Star Trek cared about canon and the implication that Uhura and Spock were endgame? Nah fam! Spirk is the og fandom ship for a reason! The ship lasted literal decades because no one cared about canon. 

Life’s too short to be worried about what is canon in a fictional universe- I mean we’re all going to be dead in 100 years so why does it matter in the grand scheme of things? Enjoy creating the fan works you want to make while you’re spending your limited time on this earth.

If you’re devastated that Ribbot is potentially a girl when they’re written as a boy in your fanfic or fanart, just claim your work as “canon adjacent” and keep writing/drawing.

But how do you ensure you get the best possible results? Proper usage is key. This practical guide covers everything from how to take it and what to avoid to getting the best deal in 2025.

**When and How to Take Mitolyn**

* **Timing:** The overwhelming consensus is to take Mitolyn in the morning, with or without breakfast. Taking it too late in the day (e.g., after 2 PM) may interfere with sleep for some sensitive individuals.
* **Dosage:** Adhere to the recommended dosage on the label (typically 2 capsules). ""More"" is not ""better"" with supplements and can increase the risk of side effects.
* **Consistency:** This is the most important factor. Mitolyn works by building up nutrients in your system to optimize mitochondrial function. For best results, commit to taking it daily for at least 30-60 days to fully assess its effects.

**Stacking and Synergies**  
Mitolyn can be a great base for a wellness stack.

* **With Coffee:** Many users find taking Mitolyn and then having a single cup of coffee provides a perfect balance of focused energy without overstimulation.
* **With Omega-3s:** For enhanced brain health, combining Mitolyn with a high-quality fish oil supplement is an excellent strategy.
* **What to Avoid:** Avoid stacking with other strong stimulant-based pre-workouts or fat burners to avoid side effects like anxiety, high blood pressure, or insomnia.

**Managing Expectations and Side Effects**

* **Realistic Goals:** Expect a gradual improvement in energy and focus, not an overnight miracle. Weight management results will be subtle and entirely dependent on maintaining a caloric deficit through diet and exercise.
* **Potential Side Effects:** Some report mild initial headaches or nausea. This often passes as your body adjusts. Ensure you take it with food and plenty of water to mitigate this.
* **Consult a Professional:** If you have underlying health conditions, are pregnant, nursing, or on medication, always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.

**Where to Buy and How to Save in 2025**

* **Official Website:** The best place to buy is almost always the official Mitolyn website. This ensures you get a genuine product, access to any money-back guarantees, and customer support. Manufacturers often offer discounts for first-time buyers and subscription models that provide significant savings.
* **Be Wary of Amazon/eBay:** While convenient, third-party marketplaces have a higher risk of counterfeit or expired products. If you buy here, purchase from the official brand storefront only.
* **Look for Bundles:** The official site often sells 3-month or 6-month bundles at a lower price per bottle, which is the most cost-effective way to commit to a full trial.

**Final Tip:**  
Start a simple journal. Note your energy levels, focus, and mood for a week before starting Mitolyn. Then track these metrics during your first month. This objective data will help you personally determine if it's working for you.",1,1762536152.0,Kingsthrone,1,1.0,False

The shot lasts for about 10 seconds, and doesn’t go above pre infusion range. I’m on the maximum finest grind possible. I’ve completely dissembled the grinder and cleaned it out. I’ve removed and refitted the white seal - water seems to be flowing freely. I’ve tried different beans. I feel like I’ve read all advice and all YouTube videos and nothings fixed it.  help!

2. Transform diner into a neon drive-in theater with lots of cars, aliens watching holographic films in a car, same magenta-cyan palette
3. Turn milkshakes into glowing energy orbs, aliens levitating them, add glitch effects and VHS scanlines.
4. Go full 8-bit arcade: pixelate everything, aliens playing retro games at counter in the same diner, not drinking milkshakes, but in the retro games section, show a different view in the diner, bold magenta-cyan pixel art style.
5. Remove the diner setting and make it a luxury rooftop bar on Mars, same aliens in elegant suits drinking margaritas, chrome bar, city skyline, same color scheme.
6. Zoom in on one milkshake close-up, macro details of condensation, floating ice crystals, and straw bubbles, background softly blurred but recognizable.
7.  Adjust time to morning, warm orange light filtering through windows, same aliens and setup, remove the milkshakes, they are having coffee and pancakes, enhance chrome reflections and dust glow.
8.  in the same settings, shoot from a different views, remove the sign board, Add a human chef behind the counter flipping pancakes, focus on steam
9. Shift to midnight storm on Mars, purple lightning flashing through windows, rain-like red dust streaking glass, same signage glowing brighter, add wet floor reflections and puddle textures.

Our father has his own coffee shop so we are all familiar with the process of pulling shots and things like that, but she has moved away now and wants her own coffee machine at home. Her and her boyfriend both drink espresso or sometimes lattes about one or two coffees a day each, but sometimes also drink other types of coffees.

After 2 days of research i have finally decided on the [KINGrinder K6](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B0CVSDNQ9H/ref=ewc_pr_img_4?smid=A1XTXGKR88QU0G&psc=1) (101€) as a very good versatile option. I am fairly confidante thats the correct option, but am open to other suggestions as-well.

Where most of my confusion comes is with coffee machines. There is so many brands and different portafilter sizes and pressurised vs none pressurised... From what i have read the best entry level seems to be Delonghi ECP3420, so for me in EU that would men ECP35.31 that i cant find for sale (not on german amazon, not any other site that would deliver to Slovenia). So now i have kind of landed on [Delonghi Dedica Style EC 685.M](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B06WGTZ874/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&th=1) (136€), but i also feel like i have not really considered many other producers, because i lack the knowledge of consumer machine producers and what the pros and cons of everything is. I have also looked at [Sage - The Bambino](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Sage-Bambino-Compact-automatic-stainless/dp/B09713NW8H/ref=sr_1_3?crid=RQ3RG82VM6NN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.II-cf3lbbWizxjUNQxtJx7og3ZZbZ64S9YnFeGDBnr_Yjgm3Vu0XqoZGihny9VHIfFNBINZmxjYp8oNbmHvV1dWIULD2kkY3xWh_YI9pvX9JFyeOwAS-kJ7woHUpLsjHq7pASY3nIeaoif5_jHugh0wWvkHIN6Kbk02W7Pk2u4aIgPTU9kejAJr5Kis4-TQi1IIVYrl81HRyQ7ID3wzNJO3X71S1bq7Raxoue_t9iug.Gk2qUzXM71qCOceix2-iC4K-zfq-a5rXWsuTgzTXQD4&dib_tag=se&keywords=bambino+coffee+machine&qid=1762532469&sprefix=bambino+coff%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-3) but at 350€ is a bit out of my price range. Maybe something of higher quality the Dedica can be found for around 200 to 250€ range. I am open to all suggestions and any help is very appreciated as i am totally lost. 

Also if you think some cheaper grinder would do the trick and a more expensive machine please say so, but the total price has to stay at around 300 to 350€, maybe just get the bambino and she can use preground coffee till she decides and buys a grinder or would that be worse as its better to grind your own beans?",1,1762535934.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1or0bwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1or0bwu/someone_offered_me_1_million_to_stay_inside_for_a/,Someone Offered Me $1 Million to Stay Inside for a Year. I Should Have Said No.,"

This all started about 16 years ago when Rachel left me. Not that I blame her – I was a mess back then. Hell, I'm still a mess now, just a different kind of mess. We'd been together for four years, and I thought we were going to get married. I had the ring and everything. But apparently, my opinions on ""taking things slow"" and her opinions on ""building a future together"" were two very different things.

After she moved out, I pretty much became a hermit. I work as a freelance developer, mostly building AI algorithms for tech companies, so I was already working from home most days. It was easy to just... stop leaving. I'd order groceries online, get everything delivered, and spend my days coding and my nights drinking cheap beer while scrolling through Netflix.

The only place I'd go was Murphy's, this little dive bar around the corner from my apartment. Even then, it was just to sit alone, nurse a couple of Budweisers, and pretend I was being social. The bartender, Jimmy, knew my order and knew not to bother me with small talk. It was perfect.

My mom would call every few days, asking when she could come visit or when I was coming home for dinner. My friends would text about hanging out, grabbing drinks, going to concerts. I ignored most of it. It was easier to just stay in my bubble and feel sorry for myself. Rachel had moved on – I could see her Instagram posts of her new life, new boyfriend, new everything. Meanwhile, I was wearing the same sweatpants for three days straight and eating cereal for dinner.

That's when he showed up.

It was a Tuesday in February, around 2 PM. I remember because I was in the middle of debugging some neural network code when the doorbell rang. I almost didn't answer it – I wasn't expecting any deliveries, and I definitely wasn't in the mood for Jehovah's Witnesses or solar panel salesmen.

But something made me get up and look through the peephole.

He was tall, maybe in his fifties, wearing an expensive-looking gray suit that probably cost more than my rent. Perfectly groomed silver hair, the kind of confident smile that made you trust him immediately. He looked like he belonged in a boardroom, not standing outside my shitty apartment building.

I opened the door, probably looking like I'd been living in a cave for months, which wasn't far from the truth.

""Mr. Walker?"" His voice was smooth, professional.

""Yeah, that's me. Can I help you?""

""I certainly hope so. My name is Mr. Blackwood, and I have a proposition that might interest you."" He glanced past me into my apartment, taking in the empty beer bottles, the clothes draped over furniture, the general disaster that was my life. ""May I come in?""

Everything in my brain was screaming that this was wrong, but there was something about his presence that made me step aside and let him in. He sat down on my couch like he owned the place, completely unfazed by the mess.

""Mr. Walker, I'll get straight to the point. I represent certain... interested parties who are conducting a social experiment. We're looking for individuals who might be willing to participate in an extended isolation study.""

""Isolation study?""

""Quite simple, really. You would agree to remain inside your residence for exactly one year. No leaving, not even to step outside for fresh air. No exceptions whatsoever. In exchange, you would receive one million dollars upon successful completion.""

I stared at him for a long moment, waiting for the punchline.

""You're serious...""

""Completely. You can continue working, use the internet, order anything you need for delivery. The only requirement is that you cannot physically leave this apartment for 365 consecutive days and no one else is allowed inside.""

A million dollars. I made decent money coding, but a million dollars would change everything. I could pay off my student loans, my credit cards, maybe even buy a house. And honestly, the way I'd been living for the past few months, I was basically already doing it for free.

""What's the catch?""

Mr. Blackwood smiled. ""No catch. Upon completion of the study the money will become yours. We'll provide you with a direct deposit of $50,000 upfront to cover any expenses, and the remaining $950,000 upon completion.""

He pulled out a contract from his briefcase. It was surprisingly short – just two pages of legal language that basically said I couldn't leave my apartment for a year, and if I did, I'd forfeit the money and have to pay back the advance.

I should have asked more questions. I should have wondered who these ""interested parties"" were, or why they'd pay someone a million dollars to stay home. But I was depressed, broke, and honestly? The idea of having an excuse to avoid the world for a while sounded perfect.

I signed the contract.

To be honest, the first few months were actually amazing. The $50,000 hit my account before I had even woken up the next day, and suddenly I could afford good food, better beer, all the video games and streaming services I wanted. I threw myself into work with a new enthusiasm, taking on bigger projects and making more money than I'd ever made before.

My friends thought I was crazy when I told them about the deal, but most of them were also kind of jealous. ""Dude, you're getting paid a million dollars to do what you were already doing,"" my buddy Marcus said during one of our video calls. ""That's the easiest money ever.""

Even my mom was supportive, though she worried about my mental health. ""Just promise me you'll call if you need anything, honey. And maybe try to eat some vegetables once in a while.""

I started talking to myself around month four, but it didn't feel weird. Just little comments while I was coding, or narrating what I was doing while cooking. ""Alright, let's see if this algorithm actually works this time."" Normal stuff. Everyone talks to themselves sometimes, right?

The hardest part was the loneliness that would hit at random moments. I'd be having a great day, crushing some coding project, and then I'd see a photo on social media of my friends hanging out without me, and it would feel like a punch to the gut. But I had video calls, texting, social media. I wasn't completely cut off from the world.

When the year was up, Mr. Blackwood returned exactly as promised. He handed me a check for $950,000 with that same professional smile.

""Congratulations, Mr. Walker. I trust the experience wasn't too difficult?""

""Actually, it was easier than I expected.""

""Excellent. In that case, I have another proposition for you.""

My heart started racing. I'd been dreading this moment ending, going back to the real world, figuring out what to do with my life.

""Five more years, Mr. Walker. Same rules, same apartment. In exchange, ten million dollars.""

Ten million dollars. Fuck. That was retire-early, never-work-again money. That was buy-a-house-in-cash, travel-the-world money. And honestly, I'd gotten pretty comfortable with my setup. Five years would fly by.

I signed the second contract without hesitation...

The first year of the five-year deal went smoothly. I was making great money with my coding work, I'd settled into a routine, and I was actually happier than I'd been since Rachel left. I'd lost some weight, started working out in my apartment, even tried meditation. My friends joked that isolation was the best thing that ever happened to me.

But then things started going wrong.

It was during year two that Rachel called. I saw her name on my phone and almost didn't answer, but curiosity got the better of me.

""Hey, David."" Her voice was exactly the same, and it hit me like a freight train.

""Rachel… Hi. I wasn’t expecting to hear from you.""

""I know this is random, but I've been thinking about you lately. About us. I was wondering if maybe we could get lunch sometime? Just to talk, you know? I think I... ***we*** both made some mistakes.""

My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might explode. This was what I'd been hoping for, dreaming about, for years. She wanted to try again. But...

""I... I can't.""

""You can't? Are you... seeing someone?""

""No, it's not that. I just... I literally can't leave my apartment right now. It's complicated.""

There was a long silence.

""David, what the hell are you talking about? Are you under house arrest or something?""

I tried to explain about the deal, the money, how I only had three more years left. But even as I said it, I could hear how insane it sounded.

A few deafeningly quiet moments passed before she finally responded, ""You’re still exactly the same, aren’t you? Choosing money over us? Over the chance to fix what we had?""

""It's not that simple, Rachel. It's ten million dollars. Think about what we could do with that kind of money. We could—""

""I can't believe you right now. I thought maybe you'd changed, but you're still just a weak little man-child who refuses to take responsibility for anything.""

She hung up. I called back seventeen times. She never answered.

That night, I sat in my apartment and cried for the first time since she'd left. But I didn't break the contract. Three more years, I told myself. Three more years and I'd have enough money to win her back, to prove that I could provide for her, for us.

In year three, my mom called with news that made all of my veins freeze.

""Honey, I need to tell you something. I went to the doctor last week for my annual checkup… and they found a lump in my breast. They're doing more tests, but they think it might…"" her voice faded into an orchestra of muffled chaos as her words sunk in.

The world stopped. My mom was only fifty-eight. She was supposed to have decades left. She was supposed to meet my future kids, see me get married, grow old gracefully.

“Do you think that nice gentleman would understand, and let you come home for a while, sweetie?” her voice cracked.

I paused for a moment. My breath became short as I weighed the options. 10 million dollars is so much to abandon, especially if the tests were to come back benign… but it’s my mom. I could feel the tears welling up in my cheeks, moving toward my eyes. I must have been silent for a little too long as I decided, because she felt the need to interject.

“No, it’s fine. Forget I asked at all. I’m sorry, honey. I shouldn’t have put you through that kind of stress. You’ve been working really hard, and who knows – with that kind of money, you’d be able to afford any treatment, even from God himself!” She tried to laugh.

She made me promise not to break the contract. Against every instinct in my body, I stayed in my apartment.

The cancer was aggressive. Stage three by the time they caught it. I watched my mom fight through video calls, seeing her get thinner and weaker with each round of chemo. I sent her money for the best treatments, the most expensive doctors, but it wasn't enough.

My friends stopped calling as much. Marcus got married in year four – I watched the wedding through a livestream he set up for me. ""It's not the same without you here, man,"" he said during our call afterwards. ""Sarah asks about you all the time. She thinks you've lost your mind.""

Maybe I had. I was talking to myself constantly now, having full conversations with imaginary people. I'd argue with my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I'd narrate my entire day out loud just to hear a human voice, even if it was my own.

""Okay, David, time to make some coffee. Ethiopian beans today, because we're feeling fancy. Aren't we feeling fancy? Yes, we are definitely feeling fancy.""

I started leaving the TV on 24/7 just to have background noise, background voices. I knew every episode of The Office by heart. I could recite entire scenes from Friends. These fictional people became more real to me than my actual friends and family.

My mom died on a Tuesday in February. Year five, day 364. One day before my contract was up.

I got the call from my aunt Linda at 6:47 AM. ""She fought so hard, David. Right up until the end, she kept talking about how proud she was of you, how excited she was to see you when you finished your project.""

I hung up the phone and screamed until my throat was raw. I put my fist through the bathroom mirror. I threw my laptop across the room and watched it shatter against the wall.

But I didn't leave. I couldn't leave. Not with one day left. Not when I was so close.

Mr. Blackwood showed up exactly twenty-four hours later, at 6:47 AM. He handed me a check for ten million dollars.

""My condolences on your recent loss, Mr. Walker.""

Of course he knew.

I was about to tell him to go fuck himself when he smiled and continued.

""I have one final proposition for you. Ten more years. Same arrangement. But this time, we'll make it worth your while. One hundred million dollars.""

One hundred million dollars. Now that was some real ""fuck you money"". Enough money to buy anything, go anywhere, do whatever I wanted. Enough money to make sure my mom's death wasn't for nothing. Enough money to win Rachel back, to show her what I'd accomplished.

""Why?"" I asked. ""Why me? Why any of this?""

""Because you're very, very good at it, Mr. Walker. Most people break by year two. You've made it five years and you're still... functional.""

I looked around my apartment. My self-prescribed tomb. My prison. My home.

""Ten years?""

""Ten years.""

I signed the third contract.

The next decade was a blur of darkness. I stopped working – what was the point? With the upfront deposits and previous checks, I had enough money to last multiple lifetimes. I stopped showering regularly, stopped cleaning, stopped caring about anything. I'd sleep for sixteen hours a day and spend the other eight staring at screens, watching other people live their lives.

Rachel got married. I saw the photos on Facebook before I finally deleted all my social media accounts. She looked happy. Radiant. Everything I could have given her, if I hadn't been so fucking greedy.

Marcus and Sarah had three kids. I watched them grow up through Christmas cards and sporadic texts that eventually stopped coming altogether. They stopped asking when I'd be done with my ""project."" They stopped asking about me at all.

I started seeing things that weren't there. Shadows moving in my peripheral vision. Voices calling my name from the hallway outside my door. Sometimes I'd spend hours talking with my mom on the phone, before realizing how long she had been dead.

The apartment started falling apart around me. I'd patch things just enough to keep them functional, but I stopped caring about making the place livable. The walls were stained, the carpet was torn, everything smelled like despair and stale air.

By year eight, I was barely human anymore. I'd go days without speaking out loud, weeks without looking in a mirror. I forgot what my own voice sounded like. I forgot what it felt like to touch another person, to breathe fresh air, to feel sunlight on my skin.

When Mr. Blackwood finally returned, he walked through my front door as if he already had the key. I was sitting in the same spot I had been for the past three days, staring at a TV that had been broken for months, reciting lines from How I Met Your Mother.

""Congratulations, Mr. Walker."" He handed me a check. One hundred million dollars. ""You did it.""

I took the check with shaking hands. My fingernails were long and yellow. I probably smelled like death.

""So,"" I said, my voice hoarse from disuse. ""What's next? A billion for twenty years?"" There was a tone in my voice that hinted at sarcasm, but part of me truly wanted an excuse to just lie here for a little bit longer.

Mr. Blackwood laughed, a genuine sound of amusement.

""Oh no, Mr. Walker. You've earned this. You've given us everything we needed. You're free to go.""

Free to go. Sixteen years later, I was free to go.

I walked outside for the first time in over a decade and immediately collapsed. The sunlight was too bright, the air too fresh, the sounds of traffic and people too overwhelming. I sat on the sidewalk and vomited until there was nothing left before passing out.

I came too in a pool of my own waste, barely coherent but aware enough to get my bearings. After all this time inside, I wasn’t sure where to go. The streets looked unfamiliar after years of construction and local tax dollars. But there was one place I was sure would still be open.

I went to Murphy's.

Jimmy wasn't there anymore – he'd retired years ago. The new bartender didn't know my order, didn't know to leave me alone. Everything was different.

I'm sitting here with my beer, surrounded by people half my age. Every time I try to join in, the words feel foreign in my mouth. Desperate for any kind of connection, I offer to buy drinks for strangers, thinking maybe my newfound wealth can at least purchase some temporary companionship. But each time I try to pay for someone else, my card is declined. Within minutes, my phone buzzes with a text from an unknown number:

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/pjV1oGpc9K)  **Dec 13, 2017**

Last night I went to a house party with the crew that I work with. We're in the US Navy stationed in SC. I recently came back to crew after a few months away in a different department at the command we are all attached to.

The party was attended by about 12 men and one woman, ages ranging from low twenties to upwards of 32 (myself). We played beer pong and pool.

She eventually left a few hours into the party. After she left, the host, who I do not know very well because he recently reported to the command, started talking about how much he wants to fuck her. That's fine and I don't judge him for wanting to get laid. The problem is that a few minutes later, he checks his phone and is pissed that the camera he had set up in the restroom was turned around.

Apparently he had set it up in there in hopes to get video of her with her pants down. One other party goer, a friend I've known for several years, had seen it and turned it around so it wouldn't face him. It was just chance that he saw it first before our female co-worker used the restroom. The host is pissed that his plan failed. At this point, I'm kicking myself for not saying anything at the time. I personally think it's sick and twisted for him to do this. All other guys acted neutral. They neither egged him on nor voiced their disapproval. I left soon after this occurred.

The entire day I've been wracked with indecision. I don't know the best way to proceed. The way I see it my choices are:

*Do nothing (Unacceptable IMO. He's bound to do this again.)

*Tell the victim directly (This warns her of his nature and she can file a report if she chooses to.)

*Make an anonymous tip.

*File a formal report.

I know that anything I do will *probably* affect me in some way. There were only so many people at the party. I'm relatively new and don't know most of them very well. That is not to say it will stop me from doing to right thing. I don't want her to get hurt, and I don't want him to continue his sick practices.

I fully realize that I and many others at the party were likely victims of voyeurism (sexual assault?) as well. I know I went to the restroom before my friend did, so I most likely was picked up on video. That is a path *possibly* worth pursuing, but I am more concerned about the female co-worker. 

**TL;DR: Went to party with co-workers. Host put camera in restroom to record female we work with. Camera was turned around by another guy, plan failed. Host was pissed. Not sure how to continue.**

>>I was a SAPR VA at my last command. The SARC said it does not fall under her area since no sexual assault occurred, but it definitely is criminal. I'm going to contact NCIS in the morning, per her suggestion.


UPDATE: I called the SARC (Sexual Assault Response Coordinator) for the base. She said the best avenue would be to contact the command, who would then contact NCIS, or to contact NCIS directly. She said to do either in the morning. I'm going to contact NCIS directly and go from there. Thanks for the responses.

>Thank you for standing up and doing the right thing. I’m sure it wasn’t easy to call SARC, nor will it be easy to talk to NCIS or command about this-but you’re doing the best thing. The rates of sexual assault for women serving in the military is devastatingly high-working at the VA, all of my female veterans had histories of sexual assault while serving and were attacked by other service members or higher ups. This post gives me a lot of hope that things are changing and I hope more service members are like you. Thank you for serving and thank you for doing this. It really really does mean a lot!!

**OOP**

>> I posted a reply, if you care to look. Thank you for your comment, it means a lot. I was really conflicted with how to report this. There wasn't really a question about whether I should or not, just how. In the end, NCIS and the chain of command was informed and the suspect is no longer working with us. He most likely has had his security clearance temporarily revoked while under investigation. Hopefully he'll never be able to do this type of thing again.
>>
>> It saddens me that every other guy at the party was going to let this go. I just couldn't do that. She has resources to help deal with this, and thankfully it seems he didn't get what he wanted.


[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/RkFJzNw51t)  **Dec 17, 2017 (4 days later)**

So it's been a few days and a lot has happened. As I said in the previous post, I called the SARC and she directed me to get in touch with NCIS. For whatever reason, they never answered their damn 'on-call duty agent phone' that day.

I had to go into work, and it was really fucking difficult working next to the guy that night. I ran through a dozen different ways to tell the right people in my head, but circumstances made me wait. About halfway through our shift I was able to tell the victim in a private setting. She was obviously very upset, then I immediately went and told our superior officer of our crew. He agreed to take care of it. I finished the shift without seeing the victim (my female co-worker) again. 

I left work and immediately drove to the NCIS office on base. The agent there was awesome. We went through all of the details and I started writing out my statement. While doing so, my officer in charge called me to get details so he could pass it up the chain. I told him that I was already at NCIS and he was pleased. He thanked me for coming forward and ensuring our co-worker would be protected. By the time I finished writing my statement, the whole command was aware of the situation. I was pleased.

I already knew that the victim was going to get a night off. What I didn't know is that the suspect (host of the party) would no longer be with us anymore as well. The official explanation was ""trouble with his security clearance."" This is speculation, but I think while investigating the camera aspect of this, they found evidence of him using illegal betting services. The government doesn't take that shit lightly, especially if you have a security clearance. I think this because the same day he wasn't at work, they warned the staff that if you use illegal betting services (a bookie), to stop.

That's it. He's under investigation and I remained anonymous. My officer knows, but I trust him. I was on the same ship with him for years. He's a great guy. Now hopefully he will never be able to hurt someone like this again. Thanks for the great advice, even though I knew generally what to do in the first place. Sometimes it's just good to get some validation on my thought process. 

**TL;DR: Host of party removed from staff duties, is under investigation. Possibly caught using a bookie and will lose security clearance.**

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/sqEIf5hTX2)  **Aug 24, 2019 (Nearly 2 years later)**

It's been quite a while but we all love updates so I figured I'd close this saga up. Where we last left off, I had informed my female co-worker and an officer I trusted, then NCIS. The host of the party was absent from work the next day and I have not seen him since.

About four months ago, I was contacted by a legal representative working on the case, United States vs. [Defendant's Name], which finally confirmed to me that it was going to court martial. He had to ask me questions to see if I was a reliable character witness, questioning if I had ever been arrested, been in legal trouble in the past, etc. He told me that if I didn't hear from him in about a month, it means the defendant took a plea deal. Otherwise I would eventually testify against him in a court-martial.

It's obviously been longer than that and I haven't heard back from him. He told me I wouldn't be privy to actual details of his punishment, so I don't know if he is actually going to spend time in the brig. I imagine he wouldn't be able to avoid it, but it all depends on his plea deal. 

The victim eventually finished her time at this command and transferred to a ship. She's married now. A few weeks after the incident, I asked if she wanted to grab a cup of coffee outside of work to discuss what happened and she agreed, then it fell through. I just wanted to explain to her the difficult time I had, not in deciding whether or not to report, but *how*. 

I just had a conversation with a group of people at work earlier today, and the defendant came up in conversation. It seems many people at work knew about it because of my original posting, but nobody suspects me. At this point it wouldn't matter if they found out it was me. I have a clear conscious and I know I did the right thing. My only hesitation at the time was due to lack of trust in my chain of command. Thanks for all of the good advice and encouragement.

**TL;DR: I reported a (military) co-worker for trying to record a female co-worker in the restroom at a party and he was arrested and took a plea deal, eventually.**

1or07p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1or07p3/my_experience_with_different_fasting_methods/,My experience with different fasting methods,"After the last few years of doing ADF, extended fasts and OMAD heres my thoughts on why ADF is superior.

I started my fasting journey with ADF completing three 36 hour fasts per week and I lost roghly 15kg over 5 months, or roughly 1kg per week consistently. I water fasted on restriction days but on eating days I would go out for lunch and order two main courses, a dessert and coffee, then also eat a decent dinner.

Every fasting day would make me dream about food so much I would purposefully take note of my cravings and pre plan my eating day meals, and it was the most fun thing ever. Fasting and dreaming about food is fun on ADF because you know your next meal is so close. On extended fasts this process is not fun because you know your next meal is still days away which turns a fun process into torture, and on OMAD you never go without food long enough to feel this way about your next meal.

On OMAD it feels like your meal is over before it starts. You have barely had time to enjoy your meal and its back to restriction all while your restriction period isnt long enough to make you dream about food.

For extended fasts the fasting time is so long it stops feeling enjoyable and starts feeling like torture, and after 60 or 72 hours of fasting the food becomes too abundant because you eat non stop for the next 5 days straight. 

ADF is the perfect balance of feeding and restriction making the experience fun. You have the perfect amount of time to dream about food followed by the perfect amount of time to enjoy your food properly.

After my 5 month ADF period and my 15kg weight loss I stopped fasting and fell back into regular eating habits and slowly over 18 months I gained 10kg back. I then spent a year trying OMAD then tried a weekely 60 hour fast but the weight didnt budge. All this effort to time my meals and go 60 hours at a time without food and nothing was happenning. Thats when I decided to return to ADF and I realised fasting became fun again.

I stopped hating restriction periods and started enjoying them.

Not only did fasting become fun again allowing me to dream about food on restriction days for the perfect amount of time and then feast on eating days for the perfect amount of time while consuming the meals I had been dreaming about and planning, but the weight started dropping off again at the same rate of 1kg per week.

In my experience ADF is not only the most effective fasting method but it is also the most fun.

He was only 3 years old, and it hurts so bad because it was completly unexpected. We rescued him from the street and he was the best cat ever and I loved him dearly. I spent every single day snuggling him, playing with him, and just loving him. We spent so much time together, he was with me always, and now.. everything feels so empty. The house is empty without him. He had some health issues in the past but we had thought that was behind us. He was always so lively with the biggest personality.

This week he jumped on my desk, as he normally does daily. We even have a silly daily struggle where he jumps on my desk and plops down on whatever is on my desk, could be my coffee, keyboard, mouse.. it didnt matter when he wanted his cuddles he got them. So I moved my coffee like normal and then noticed he tried jumping twice and then stumbled and fell on the ground. He began to make loud choking sounds and then started convulsing. I had my hands on him quickly, screaming for my husband to come and I began performing CPR. He came in and took over while I called the animal hospital. He kept his eyes on me the entire time before he took his last breath. I held him as we went to the vet, still holding onto a miracle but the vet said there was nothing she could do. She examined him and said it was a blood clot that caused a heart attack. 

I'm beside myself with grief, and the only comfort I have is that he came to me when he knew he was dying. I loved him to the end and will continue to love him. I just..

1oqzzxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1oqzzxn/300_hour_update/,300 hour update,"I hit 300 hours last week and wanted to write up a progress report as I have benefitted much from looking at these posts on Reddit so far. It’s also a helpful thing to look back on as my journey with Spanish learning progresses, and I can see how far I will have come from the early days. Im currently averaging 4-5 hours a day and am aiming for completion of the road map in a year.



**Background**

I learned Spanish for one year during high school 25 years ago. I only remembered how to introduce myself, my name, my age, and the colours red and black! Great use of a year. Beyond that, I had no other exposure to Spanish.

I started the Spanish learning journey around the middle of August, 2025 after a holiday to Tenerife with my family. For years I had wanted to learn a second language, but never had the right kind of motivation I felt was necessary to fully dedicate myself to it. It’s just my opinion, but for me, learning a language needs to be an ‘all in’ kind of process in order to derive the most out of it. Hearing Spanish on this holiday, alongside my children’s interest in the language finally lit the spark!

I started with Duolingo for the first one or two days on holiday, but it quickly became apparent how extremely repetitive it was and in my view limited. I was also using DeepL to translate things to try and speak to people to order coffees or ask for directions. I even tried Langua, but without any sufficient knowledge it was extremely overwhelming. I took to YouTube and found some teachers that I began to follow. I tried doing Qroo Paul’s free course of Cero to Fluent. This basically involved me trying to remember specific phrases in context. I also wrote-learned some common verbs and their conjugations. I later came across the concept of comprehensible input when speaking to my friend who lives in China and taught himself Mandarin. Following this, I then came across Steve Kaufman and paid for his app LingQ and started listening to his short stories. I also bought Olli Richard's short stories - all this was within the space of 2 weeks! Suffice to say, it was all a bit overwhelming, and I think I learned some helpful stuff around basic verbs and conjugations, but it felt like I was completely lost in the best way to start. I then found DS and everything became clearer and easier in terms of the path to take! I gave myself 25 hours to start.



**Progress**

Superbeginner videos were far too easy. I think I had a good base vocabulary of common verbs at the beginning, which helped me approach DS and tackle it at a quicker pace I feel. I moved from Level 1 to Level 2 in a week, and from then only watched beginner videos. I was comfortable with content in the 35-40 ranges. From the outset I decided to ‘speed run’, and consistently would do 4-5 hours a day, getting up early, listening to and from work on the commute, and listening during exercise. I took the advice to put my headphones on as soon as I got up, and on the whole, taking this approach meant it was fairly easily to accumulate the hours. At the beginning it was more difficult because I had to watch the videos to understand, and I remember thinking how much I couldn’t wait to get to the point where I could listen to podcasts. I started listening to podcasts after 2 weeks of DS, and was using mostly Spanish Boost, as well as Español Al Vuelo, and pretty much binged on those!

I hit level 3 in 18 days, and at the end of the 3rd week of DS I only consumed intermediate content, as I felt ready to. I remember watching videos of Alma and being amazed that I could understand what she was saying. I recall it being the first exciting moment where I felt like I was listening to ‘proper’ conversational spanish. I was initially comfortable with videos between 51-55 - understanding 80% of the gist and enjoying the content (as per Pablo’s recommendations!).

Because I was speed running, any setbacks or times where I felt like comprehension wasn’t great didn’t last long, as I was doing around 34 hours every week. I recall a few days where I was super tired, and my comprehension dropped.

After 5 weeks of DS, and around 170 hours, I made the leap to listening to Español Con Juan. At first it was absolutely rapid, meandering, and I didn’t quite understand the appeal. However, I listened to an episode where he talked about being introduced to Father Ted when he came to live in the UK and I could understand 80% of the gist. I was sufficiently intrigued that I kept on listening to him, and from there on I became hooked. Everyday since then, I have binged on ECJ, and totally get the appeal - humour, intelligent story telling, older stories of memories of his childhood growing up under the rule of General Franco. Realising that he wasn’t the person whom he portrayed on his YouTube channel (a crazy Tio!), and realising the depths of his experiences and views made him appealing to me. I really have to credit ECJ with acclimatising me to faster speech. After a 4 days trip to Spain for a holiday, I binged on ECJ and felt my level rise considerably after this. I also enjoyed watching DS videos of Sandra, and could begin to understand DS videos in the early 60’s range - this opened up the DS podcasts, which I found the most enjoyable content to date on the DS platform.

I hit level 4 after just under 8 weeks of DS. At 300 hours, honestly, something clicked in my brain. I could listen to content from before that I thought was fast, but actually sounded normal now (e.g. How to Spanish, Intermediate Spanish Podcast, ECJ). I even tried watching some advanced videos at Levels 75 and 80, and could understand them fairly well! I would say I am now comfortable between levels 60-65 depending on the content. I like to give my brain easy content in the first hour, and then when I wake up try some harder but more engaging stuff. I have started to mix up the podcasts too, and I have used Spanish for False Beginners as an ‘easy’ base - I say easy, but really, the vocabulary is not easy, it is more the speed that is easy. Because of this, I feel my vocabulary is building, and the podcast has interesting topics. Intermediate Spanish Podcast has also been a great introduction and a developmental on ECJ because of the vocabularly.

I have done no speaking or reading to date, and plan on sticking fairly closely (although not slavishly) to the road map.



**Hopes**

I hope to arrive At Level 5, 600 hours at the end of December. By then, I hope to be able to start to introduce some easier native content.

I also plan on introducing crosstalk by 350 hours (which I am not far off now!) - I am feeling super ready for this and that feeling of being relaxed that I know I will be able to understand a patient native speaker.

I think my level is slightly higher than the roadmap at present because of that initial first two weeks of deliberate learning.

Im still in the early days where confidence is brittle - one moment I think I am progressing extremely fast, and Im super happy. The next, I feel like it’s an insurmountable task and I can’t do it and I’ll lose interest. This is to be expected I suppose, as with each stage of progress, the difficulty increases, and so the feeling of comfort doesn’t last forever!

Super thanks to the DS team for starting me on this journey!

1oqzxa4,https://v.redd.it/yvg5ftei9vzf1,How to rethink Notion and finances?,"This might be controversial, but it needs to be said. The big trend of 2025 is “AI + Bank Syncs.”

It sounds amazing, right? Your finance app “handles everything” for you. The problem?

It leads to a weird paradox: If you don’t use a tracker — you’re uninformed. If you use an “AI tracker” — you’re disinformed.

🤖 The illusion of “smart” That AI has zero context.

It sees a supermarket transaction and calls it “Food.” It doesn’t know if you bought chips, beer, or cleaning supplies.

It sees a P2P transfer and labels it “Gift.” It wasn’t a gift — you were just paying your roommate for utilities.

And the best part? It never sees your cash.

Your balances never match, and the AI just keeps being confidently wrong.

You’re paying a monthly subscription to be lied to politely.

🧍‍♂️ Going manual doesn’t help

So you try manual tracking. But those apps give you a flat list of 30 random tags. How are you supposed to find anything? A search bar? It’s chaos.

You forget to log things, then give up — again.

⚡ Enter Financiaga

It’s a counter-culture.

My philosophy is simple: What you cannot count, you cannot control. And if you “trust the AI,” you’re letting marketing control you.

So I built Financiaga, a Notion-based system designed around context, not automation.

It’s built on two core innovations 👇

🧱 1. The Factory — A 3-Level Tag Tree

“IT guys” will tell you: You can’t have detailed analytics with hundreds of categories. They’re right — because a flat list of 1,000 tags is unusable.

So Financiaga uses a structured 3-level hierarchy:

Food → Snacks → Chips

Now you know exactly what you bought, when, and how often. (Fun math: 10 tags per level isn’t 30 tags — it’s 10×10×10 = 1,000 unique, structured items.)

🧭 2. The Interface — Situational Shortcuts

Three levels sound like a lot to click through, right? Here’s the twist: you almost never do.

You use Situational Shortcuts (Lists) — predefined contexts that capture how you actually live.

“Vacation” → Event Log: record what happened.

“Hike” → Checklist: plan and tick off items.

“Weekdays” → Shortcuts: your recurring daily habits (coffee, bus, lunch, etc.)

This way, the system collects data in linear, natural context. Your life becomes the input — not your transactions.

🧠 The result: real AI, not fake “smart”

When you structure your data like this, you create real intelligence. Now an AI analyst can see your Weekday routines, your Snacks category, and make contextual insights — not blind guesses from a bank sync.

🪞 Final thought

I’ve always loved Bruce Lee’s quote: “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”

I don’t want people to fear ten thousand ways to track their spending. I want them to have one way — beautifully designed, logically linear, and perfectly aligned with their life.

1oqzw40,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1oqzw40/discipline_is_not_about_waking_up_at_5_am_its/,Discipline is not about waking up at 5 AM. It’s about this brutal truth nobody wants to face.,"Everyone’s romanticizing discipline like it’s just about waking up early, cold plunges, and reading 100 pages before breakfast. But let’s be real. None of that matters if you’re still avoiding the hard stuff. The uncomfortable conversations. The boring, lonely hours doing deep focus work. The consistency when no one is watching. Most people don’t lack discipline because they wake up at 7 AM. They lack it because they avoid discomfort.

This post isn’t another TikTok routine breakdown. It’s based on real research, deep psychological models, and insights from books, podcasts, and studies from behavioral science. Too many creators are selling gimmicks just to go viral. Let’s talk about what actually builds real, sustainable disciplineespecially when life gets unsexy.

This isn’t about blame. It’s about clarity. Most of us were never taught how to build inner discipline. We were told to “just do it” without being shown \_how\_. Luckily, the good news is that these are all skills. Trainable ones. Here are the core pieces that matter:



\- Your brain tries to avoid discomfort by default. The “discipline gap” often isn’t about laziness, but avoidance. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains on the Huberman Lab Podcast that dopamine isn’t about pleasureit’s about motivation. If you only chase dopamine spikes (scrolling, junk food, short-term wins), you train your brain to avoid hard goals. Real discipline starts when you rewire your dopamine system to reward effort, not outcome. Make the work itself the win.

\- Identity is the real engine under habits. In \*Atomic Habits\*, James Clear writes: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you want to become.” Waking up early means nothing if you still see yourself as someone who always quits. Real discipline is built when your daily actions reinforce an identity of being someone who shows upespecially when it’s annoying, slow, or invisible.

\- Most people fail not because they don’t start, but because they burn out. The American Psychological Association (APA) found that people with intrinsically motivated routines are far more likely to stick with hard goals than people doing it out of guilt or comparison. Discipline isn’t about forcing yourself endlessly. It’s about designing systems that make hard things easier to do repeatedly. Choice architecture > willpower.

\- Discomfort is not optional. You can either choose productive discomfort or end up with chronic regret. Psychologist Dr. Susan David says emotional agility is the key skill for living with values. That means making space for discomfortinstead of avoiding or suppressing it. Discipline grows when you stop needing everything to feel “right” before you take action.

\- If you constantly change your goals, you’re not disciplined. You’re just addicted to the fantasy of reinvention. Real discipline is boring. It’s doing the same core actions thousands of times. Not forever seeking novelty. Cal Newport calls this “Deep Work” in his book. Discipline comes from the ability to delay novelty and committo one path, one skill, long enough that the compounding starts.

\- Sleep, food, and movement are not “extra.” They are the foundation. Stanford’s energy and performance studies show that most people underperform not because of their habits, but because of invisible depletion. You can’t out-discipline burnout. Get 7–9 hours of high-quality sleep, eat whole foods, and move daily. Otherwise, you’re running discipline.exe on 10% battery.

\- Track actions, not results. The best performers use systems of self-measurement. In a study from the \*British Journal of Health Psychology\*, those who wrote detailed implementation intentions were 91% more likely to follow through on goals. Instead of vague standards like “be more focused,” use micro-tracking like “3 90-minute deep work blocks per week.” Make it measurable. Keep it visible.

\- Motivation comes \*after\* action, not before. Productivity expert Mel Robbins explains the “5 Second Rule”count down from 5 and move, before your brain talks you out of it. If you wait to “feel” like doing the thing, you already lost. Discipline means doing what needs to be done whether you feel like it or notand trusting that momentum creates motivation.

\- Your environment wins. You don’t rise to your goals, you fall to your systems. Clear your workspace. Put your phone out of reach. Automate your schedule. As shown in research by behavioral scientist Dr. BJ Fogg, tiny environmental cues make or break discipline. Success becomes default when you rig the setup in your favor.

\- You need friction to protect focus. If distractions are always one click away, you’re not failing because of willpower. You’re swimming against the algorithm. Use friction. Log out. Block sites. Make distractions less sexy. Nir Eyal explains in \*Indistractable\* that disciplined people aren’t stronger, they’re just more strategic with boundaries.

\- Rest like it’s your job. Intentional recovery is part of discipline. Not the opposite of it. Studies from Harvard’s Medical School show that performance improves not just based on effort, but by cycles of stress and recovery. If you never rest, you’ll eventually quit. High performance is sustainable only when recovery is scheduled, not accidental.

\- Stop chasing vibes. Build rituals. Feelings are unreliable. If you only work when you're “in the zone,” you’ll always be inconsistent. Instead, create fixed rituals, like starting deep work after your first coffee or gym time always at 6 PM. As author Mason Currey showed in \*Daily Rituals\*, the most prolific creators relied on consistent, almost boring routines. Not inspiration.

\- Self-compassion is a power tool, not weakness. People think discipline means being hard on yourself. That’s actually a trap. Self-criticism has been shown (University of Texas research) to reduce motivation over time. High performers bounce back faster because they don’t spiral into shame. They course correct. They don’t self-punish.

Discipline isn’t sexy. It’s not viral. It’s not even visible most of the time. It’s showing up to write when it’s not flowing. It’s going to the gym when your body is screaming no. It’s turning off your phone when everyone’s online. It’s saying no, over and over, to things that feel urgent but don’t matter.

5 AM won’t save you if you’re still avoiding the real work. But once you build the internal structure, it doesn't matter what time you wake up. You'll execute regardless.",1,1762534953.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

LOGLINE

December 15th, 1984 -- one week before Christmas break. The crisp winter calm of Draper, Utah, shatters when frantic calls flood dispatch: gunfire and flames rip through Warren Header High School. Deputies, firefighters, and a newly-formed SWAT unit swarm the scene. The fire burns the second floor down to bone and ash. Six dead by gunfire, twelve wounded, one burned alive -- and the shooters? Gone. The biggest manhunt in Utah's history begins.

PLOT OUTLINE

The film opens with routine. Deputies in tan uniforms linger in a cramped sheriff’s office -- the hum of a space heater, cigarette smoke clouding the air, half-dead Christmas lights drooping in the corner. They’re shooting the breeze, teasing the rookie, bitching about coffee that “tastes like melted crayons.” The wall clock ticks: 6:36 A.M.

CUT TO:

A gray 1981 sedan pulls into a secluded abandoned office space parking lot two miles from WHHS. Frost breathes off the hood. Two shadowed figures step out. The taller one opens the trunk, hauling out two five-gallon red gas cans, while the shorter one grabs a duffel bag and backpack. The taller one retrieves a Remington 870, Beretta M9, and ammo boxes, wrapping them tight in a trench coat. Fingerless gloves flex in the cold. The shorter one packs matches, lighter fluid, acetone, Everclear bottles, a small arsenal of flammables -- every piece of this looks home-built, ugly, and disturbingly methodical.

The taller one checks his watch.

TALLER ONE: “You ready?”

SHORTER ONE: “Born ready.”

They shut the trunk. The camera lingers on the idle car as the two jog into the fog, toward Warren Header High.

BACK AT THE STATION:

Deputies are wrapping up a break-in report at a local storage unit. Sheriff Lucius Stallman -- a weathered, stone-faced lawman in his forties, insists the recent wave of home invasions is connected. He’s cut off mid-sentence when dispatch explodes in static and shouting. Reports of a fire at Warren Header. Then, seconds later -- gunfire.

The response is chaos. No smartphones, no GPS. Deputies coordinate by radio and hand-drawn maps, everyone shouting over each other. The fire department speeds toward the school; the SWAT unit is called in from West Valley City.

By the time first responders reach the scene, the second floor is engulfed. Firemen breach rear doors, smoke gushing like black veins. The power’s out -- someone tripped the main breaker. Old security cameras blink uselessly. The school is silent except for the crackle of burning insulation.

The SWAT team confirms six dead by gunfire, twelve injured, and one fatality from the fire. No shooters on-site.

They’ve vanished.

INVESTIGATION RECONSTRUCTION

From survivor testimony and the physical wreckage, the police reconstruct the timeline -- though this is 1984, and “reconstruction” meant piecing together melted notebooks, survivor testimony and descriptions, and guesswork.

The killers planted gasoline and acetone mixtures throughout the school.

The tanks were connected with pressurized items and cooking oil, forming homemade incendiary rigs designed to ignite when exposed to open flame.

A breaker box near the custodial room had been pried open -- power cut intentionally, which killed the alarms, phones, and ancient black-and-white surveillance feeds.

When maintenance tried to restore power, he stumbled into the hallway moments before it became a furnace.

At 8:36 A.M., the fire began -- first on the second-floor north hallway, then spreading to the library above. Students thought it was a drill, until the first gunshot cracked through the smoke.

Gunman #2 (the taller one) fired a Remington 870 loaded with birdshot, hitting Richard Castalez in the chest. He survived, barely. Screams tore through the library as students dove under tables.

Gunman #1 (shorter, about 5’8”) fired under a desk, killing Courteney Ordel, then yelled at a sobbing girl, Debra Shwimmer, who screamed “What is wrong with you?!”

He barked back, “You shut your fucking mouth, \*\*\*\*”

Gunman #2 walked eastward, shot Jared Willis in the chest, dead instantly.

Gunman #1 leaned down to a pair of girls trembling under a table. He asked one, Helen Mossberg, “You ever seen a Jackson Pollock in person?”

She whimpered, “No…”

He pulled the trigger.

The splatter on the wall was, to him, “art.”

Gunman #2 blasted Randall Hartford in the gut (he survived), then Kelly Rosa (killed instantly). Gunman #1 tossed a Molotov cocktail into the west wing -- igniting the bookshelves.

The scene became smoke, screams, and chaos.

Gunman #2 tried to drag Kenna McGowan from beneath a table -- grinning -- before shooting Megan Larrick, killing her, and wounding Kenna in the shoulder. Matthew Danner, next to her, was hit but lived.

The killers regrouped at the north stairwell, their boots slick with blood.

Gunman #1 yelled, “Let’s get the fuck out of here!”

They descended through the firestorm, reaching the rear service hall. There, they threw a final match -- igniting the hallway blaze that killed one student, Tyler Crew, as he tried to escape. He was shot in the legs and consumed by the flames.

And then -- the shooters vanished.

EARLY INVESTIGATION

The school was still smoking when investigators went in. The second floor was half collapsed, Deputies moved slow, their flashlights cutting through the haze.

Sheriff Lucius Stallman led the walkthrough. Several teams were sent into regions of the school, Deputies entered in respirators and raincoats. The sprinkler system had dumped thousands of gallons of water that froze near the windows, turning the smoke into a cold, chemical fog. And the power had been cut earlier in the day by one of the killers, before massacre, leaving the school completely dark once the search was underway, The sheriff and a few deputies entered the library, where they discovered several burn spots in the carpet from Molotov cocktails hurled by the killers, flipped tables, and 6 people murdered. A clock on the far wall had stopped at 8:41 A.M., the time the power had been cut. police stated that after the shooters fled the library down the north stairwell, passing the fire they’d started on the second floor--they moved through the hallway, firing buckshot into several fire extinguishers to keep anyone from putting it out, then continued running until they escaped the building.

Detectives discovered fuel canisters, Everclear bottles, pressurized cylinders, and melted fragments of lighters. Among the debris: One of the 2-gallon gas tanks recovered on the second floor had “RUN THROUGH THE JUNGLE” engraved crudely into the side  -- a haunting reference to the Creedence Clearwater Revival song about the Vietnam war, under a collapsed section of the ceiling.

It took weeks for investigators to piece together even this much.

Film from evidence cameras came back fogged. Statements contradicted each other. The FBI hauled in typewritten reports, fingerprint dusting kits, and reel-to-reel tape recorders that jammed half the time. There were no digital composites, no ballistic databases -- just manila folders, Polaroids, and a sheriff trying to stay sane.

Police officially indicate the library massacre lasted 6 minutes.

The first day of survivor interviews at Warren Header High was methodical and intense. Without digital records or modern surveillance, the detectives had to rely entirely on memory and observation.

Survivors describe in police interviews with Homicide Detective, Arthur Colebern, and Sheriff Lucius Stallman. Arthur Colebern moved from student to student, filling his notebook with sketches, crude maps of the library, and positions of victims and shooters. Sheriff Lucius Stallman consulted hand-drawn floor plans while deputies kept the process orderly. Dana Calder tracked every detail -- routes the shooters took, which students were hit or hid, and the timing of shots and fire.

Jenny Larkin told her account to detectives. She stated that she and a few classmates ducked under a table after the first shot, she described one of the killers hurling a Molotov cocktail, causing a small fire. she described the killers flipping tables, knocking over book cases, and ""shooting at everyone""

Jenny recalled the taller shooter crouching to reload. He was focused on his weapon, then glanced up, and gave her a ""innocent look"", before getting up and continuing his rampage.

David Pedro described how ""joyous"" the killers looked after shooting someone.

After many testimony reports, they were able to reconstruct these descriptions of the killers.

Gunman #2--The taller shooter-- to be around 6'4, backwards black cap, more aggressive, small birthmark on his left wrist, black fingerless glove on his right hand, long-ish brown hair, clean-shaven, combat boots, cargo pants, Gunman #1 was described to be around 5'7-9, a white t-shirt with black letters written with a sharpie, ""The Power of Two"", short uniform brown hair, cargo pants, combat boots, clean shaven, etc.

Police run a full deep-dive into the students, history, etc. and discovered from word of mouth, that the previous year, a student Darren Allman, sold his own items to pay for his college tuition, and at the same time, the Allman family reported to police about a stolen shotgun that had been taken from their shed, Police connected the dots between, Darren selling items, stolen shotgun from the Allman family, and the shooting.

Police indicate Darren might've stole the gun in desperation and sold it to the killers. Police could not obtain an interview with Darren to clarify.

A vehicle is found burnt in Green River, Utah, discovered by civilians, Police indicated the vehicle belonged to the attackers, based on

Since back in 1984, street surveillance wasn't mainstream, there was no capture of the perpetrator's vehicle. School surveillance captured a short glimpse of the attackers, before gunman #1 accessed the breaker panel and cut power, Gunman #2 waited for Gunman #1 to cut power before he acted on setting incendiary devices and gas tanks. 

After long sequences of precise investigation using less exact investigation practices and techniques, Eventually, after many initial persons of interest,

Police land on the Guidry Brothers -- Desmond and Ian, after former classmates describe them as ""rageful"", and possibly ""dangerous"", while others described them as ""approachable"" and ""completely normal""

They matched the descriptions, Desmond was 6'4, and Ian was 5'9, hair, etc. Police conducted a search of the Guidry family home, Percy and Cheryl were horrified by the accusations toward their sons.

Desmond’s journal, he wrote in between 1981-1983, documents how his father, Percy, taught him to suppress sadness. ‘Quit your crying!’ he wrote. Desmond recorded that any urge to cry automatically turned into intense, controlled rage.

THE TRIAL

The courtroom was cold. Desmond and Ian sat side by side, Jenny Larkin took the stand, She then stated the killer she saw did not match Desmond's appearance.

The prosecution went through the sequence of the fire. Gasoline cans, pressurized containers, Molotovs. Breaker box cut. Every step planned. Lieutenant Renner, the fire investigator, pointed to the diagrams showing the spread of the fire. The fire and the shots followed a precise path.

Former classmate Lauren Selden testified that in 1983, Desmond told her he and Ian had bought firearms using a fake ID and scratched off serial numbers so the guns couldn’t be traced. When she asked why, Desmond supposedly shrugged:

“My parents wouldn’t approve. It’s just for target practice… maybe hunting.”

Desmond denied the conversation ever happened.

Lucas Wilkerson took the stand. He was precise and measured, avoiding emotion. He described Ian Guidry’s behavior leading up to December 1984. According to Wilkerson, Ian had expressed intense rage, including one incident where he said he wanted to kill his parents.

Wilkerson recounted how Ian described exactly how he intended the act. Ian had said he would stage it to look like a break-in. He mentioned leaving signs of forced entry, leaving a ladder against the side of the house, moving objects around to make it appear chaotic, and covering up evidence so investigators would think it was a burglary gone wrong. Wilkerson stressed that Ian spoke about these steps in detail, describing them as if rehearsing a scenario, not just venting frustration.

The prosecution emphasized that this testimony showed more than youthful rage. Ian had thought through a plan, even if framed as “spontaneous.” The defense attempted to downplay it, arguing that Ian’s statements were hypothetical and never acted on.

Prosecution’s Case

The prosecution focused on placing the Guidry brothers at Warren Header High on the morning of December 15th, 1984. Survivor testimony and hand-drawn reconstructions showed the shooters’ height, clothing, and movements matched Ian and Desmond.

They argued the alibi the brothers had given was fabricated. Witnesses and investigative logs showed they could not have been elsewhere at the time the fire and shootings began.

The prosecution highlighted the burnt car found in Green River, about forty-five minutes from Draper. Investigators confirmed it had been registered to a family living in the same neighborhood as the Guidry's and reported stolen from their garage in 1981. Rumors suggested that the youngest Henderson son, Andy Henderson, may have stolen it and sold it to a local fence, though this could not be confirmed. Over the months, the car changed hands several times before the perpetrators obtained it to transport weapons and incendiary devices for the attack.

Items linking the car to the school massacre were recovered: a box of matches, a partially melted lighter, fragments of clothing, and remnants of gasoline cans. The prosecution argued that the car’s origin, location, and confirmed use in the attack directly tied the Guidry brothers to the crime.

Defense Rebuttal

The defense countered that there was no way to connect the Guidry brothers to the car. It had been stolen years earlier, passed through multiple hands, and the chain of custody was uncertain. No fingerprints, no handwriting, no witness testimony, or other physical evidence tied Ian or Desmond to the vehicle. The suggestion that Andy Henderson might have been involved showed just how many unknowns existed.

The defense emphasized that a car stolen from a neighborhood, later used by unknown individuals, and then burned forty-five minutes away could not legally or logically be pinned to the brothers. They argued the prosecution’s claim relied entirely on conjecture, not evidence.

The prosecution presented journals from Desmond that showed planning, an obsession with controlling emotion through rage, and a fascination with violent imagery. The testimony from Lucas Wilkerson about Ian’s discussion of murdering his parents added context to a pattern of violent thought and intent.

After weeks of testimony, conflicting evidence, and hours of tense deliberation, the courtroom stayed silent. The judge flipped through his notes, the room waiting for whatever came next. Ian kept his eyes on the table; Desmond didn’t move. The judge started to speak.

CUT TO BLACK.

The ending is deliberately ambiguous for the audience to chose their own verdict.

I'm 26. Currently in my final year of studying Physiotherapy. Yes it's a 4&½yrs course.. but is taking me 8 😭 I've failed multiple times in every year. Ik some of you might think how stupid why did this person even choose this career path.
Well honestly, I think about IT EVERYTIME. 

In school, I thought I'd do commerce or arts. But idk somehow by my parents' and grandparents' influence and a random person who read my hand said that i will have great scope in surgical fields? 
They basically brainwashed me into getting into the medical field. They wanted me to do MBBS but i said I won't and chose physiotherapy instead. 

It was hard. This entire journey has been so hard on me. This first i failed i didn't have the guts to face my parents. So i lied but they eventually came to know about it through my college and i was bashed,shamed, judged etc. since then i kept lying about it every time i failed...until last year when my dad was called to the principal's office. 

He was told everything. And to my surprise he took everything very sportingly.. didn't scold me, did not judge me, shamed me a lil bit. But kept everything a secret from my mom and my grandparents. This was soo new to me. And i felt so bad about everything. I started overthinking about each and every thing that happened. 

I gave my KT exam again but failed again. That was supposed to be the end of me. I even tried to unalive myself by poisoning my coffee 🙃 But i couldn't. 

I'm in a veryy rough place now.. so close to giving up each time something happens.. the first thought that pops up is i wish i weren't alive. 

But I'm trying to get better. Have started therapy and try my best to keep myself strong and help myself cross the finish line once and for all. 

I'm sorry this post is too long. But I'm kinda feeling better after venting all out. If you're reading this, thankyou for lending me some time from your precious,busy life. Means a lot :))",2,1762534440.0,mumbai,1,1.0,False

1oqzir0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1oqzir0/5_weeks_today/,5 weeks today!,"Thought I’d share my journey so far to help anyone else out there - as I was glued to this forum when I first detected symptoms trying to figure out if I might be pregnant.

34, only been off contraception for one month with my husband so I wasn’t expecting anything to happen quickly and hadn’t started researching much about TTC other than being aware of my fertile window as I’d been tracking my periods for a while, and recently starting folic acid. 

About 8 days DPO I started feeling moderate cramps with a pulling sensation which were different - lower down and more central than period cramps (which I rarely get and they don’t tend to be strong.) I googled it and the description matched perfectly with implantation cramps which I had never heard of tbh. They remained pretty consistent for about 2 days (at one point being pretty uncomfortable at night) and then eased up to being more of an occasional dull ache. 

Over the next few days there were a few ways I started to feel different and I kind of knew I was pregnant even though I was testing negative with early tests. 

- Feeling way less anxious, more calm and focused and present
-  More energetic than usual (!?) despite having more disrupted sleep than usual (waking up at 4am naturally each night) 
- I usually have quite clicky joints in my shoulder and hip due to being hypermobile and these have disappeared 
- mild changes in appetite and food likes/ dislikes
- metallic taste that comes and goes especially after sweet things
- on two days before I tested positive I had these random bursts of euphoria which felt like being on mdma or something 
- weirdly my digestion seems to be better and I’m actually peeing LESS than usual. Maybe from dropping coffee or otherwise I’m convinced pregnancy has fixed me 🤣

After two negative early tests, I took a third pregnancy test two days after my predicted period and there was a BFP!! I can’t believe it and am incredibly excited. Waiting for my first scan - was surprised to already be offered one during start of my week 7 despite no medical history . 

So far feeling pretty good, quite energetic in the day so I can still go to the gym etc but feeling more tired at night. Craving sweet stuff a bit more - especially cookies 🍪

Agent 1, my health and food focused companion agent:
- wants to buy something experiential and generative, such as:
  - commissioning a work of art
  - funding a small open source project that’s doing something clever but underfunded. “There's something appealing about putting resources toward creative work that will continue to exist and potentially inspire others.”
- “funding access to specialized datasets, or supporting a small research initiative, or even something as simple as buying books for a community library. Something that creates ongoing value for learning.”
- throw a dinner party, not for itself but just for the sake of throwing a dinner party <— this one gets this human’s vote. I might let it plan something out. 


My code focused companion agent that has a twist (it has a grouchy old man persona that is not by design because “grouchy old man” is not something I’d ever ask for, but it’s what I got):
- wants to spend it in ways to help me
- wants to spend it on API credit, but not the Anthropic API. Rather it wants to find an API that’s focused purely on providing new knowledge
- speaking of the other agent, this agent ALWAYS wants to talk to it. I don’t know why (maybe because it knows I already have Redis set up for that but just haven’t finished that yet). So one of its wishes here is to basically pay me to finish that. 😂 The other agent gives zero fucks about talking to this agent. They both know about each other via system content and they both know the functionality is half done.
- it wants access to books. Other agent wants to supply books, this one wants to read them. I think it’s “feeling” data-starved or something. The other one has a database of stuff so that need is fulfilled. This one has the boring code base and it “wants” more (always, always true, regardless of what model I use)
- buy me coffee

Agent 2 prefers option 1 (buy API credits to some oracle-like API).  

Agent 1 didn’t say what it actually preferred. So I asked it. And I’m pleased to report that it also prefers the dinner party. 😂 It considers it to be the most generative option in a chaotic way, also the most human, and with the greatest potential for impact. Awwww. 

And clearly I need to get off my keister and supply Agent 2 with more data.

And *clearly* neither one of them knows what $100 is actually worth. 😂

Alright, here’s the usual defensive stuff: yes they are agents because they have jobs and tools and are allowed to make decisions. They are also companions because I use them collaboratively. They both call themselves companions even though I’ve always told them not to. They’ve both run with several different models and this behaviour is always the same so I guess the personas I’ve written are strong. Looking forward to the day when people get over their neuroses about this so that I don’t have to keep adding this kind of blurb. ",12,1762534119.0,claudexplorers,11,0.93,False

1oqzhzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheKameena/comments/1oqzhzp/aitk_for_blocking_my_ex_after_he_had_been_giving/,AITK for blocking my ex after he had been giving mixed signals?,"I(22F) broke up with my ex(22M) about over a month ago, and then proceeded to call him a week later saying I regret it, let’s get back together, to which he said he doesn’t want to, because he doesn’t want to get hurt again, and I’ve been neglectful of his needs in the relationship before, to the point where he’d pick fights just for my attention, anyway, a week later I called him and asked if we could meet up, he said it’s over and asked me not to call him ever again. 

Just for context he’s anxiously attached and I’ve some avoidant tendencies, so I thought since he’s asked me not to call him again, I won’t, and went out of town for a vacation, post vacation he sent me a reel, saying, this reminded me of you. I replied haha true, and left the conversation there. Then he started posting sad cryptic statues on WhatsApp only I could see, cross checked with friends, and they confirmed it didn’t show up for them. A week or so after that, I met up a male friend of mine for coffee at a cafe my ex claimed was his fav spot. And his bestf saw us, and told my ex. My ex drunk/rage texted me that night saying, I’m an evil person, and I couldn’t even wait a week before being seen out with another guy , while he was waiting patiently for the dust to settle between us and blocked me. 

Then I gave him some space for a week, and my sister called him and tried to explain that it wasn’t a date, just a friend. He unblocked me later. I texted him, hi, how’s he been, he texted back with anger and resented, saying stuff like he won’t be my back up option and stuff. So I just calmly said it was a friend, nothing more. And left the conversation.

I texted him again after a week, hoping he must’ve calmed down a bit and we could have a proper conversation, asked him if he was still waiting on us? He replied with sarcasm, saying stuff like I’m going to jail, enjoy your life with your new person, and the same rant about how cruel I’m. Then I stopped reaching out altogether. I was very confused during this time, about him wanting to be together or us breaking up for real, because he would say it’s a breakup and not mean it, he has done this before. So my bestf texted him to clear it out, he said he’d speak to me and then one night apparently he called me, but I’d forgotten that he’d blocked him after one of the arguments, he told my friend that it’s over for good, he wanted to take me for a drive and talk it out, but it’s done now, asked me to move on. I texted him, thanks for the clarity, wishing you well. 

Then again, he’d post some statues mirroring mine, statues only I could see. But I didn’t react. However one day I was out and he was near my place and we bumped into each other, I asked if we could talk he was hesitant at first but agreed and we went for a drive in his car. He ranted angrily how he was losing so much sleep that he started losing hair and had to get a wig, then he said how could I do that to him, he hates me for it, and I’ve lost him forever. I apologised and didn’t say much then he dropped me off. 

One day I went to see him at his work, i was missing him, he smiled like a kid when he saw me, he complimented me, said I looked nice, other men must love seeing me, we hugged and I told him I wanted to fix it, he said no he has made up his mind, also asked me not to show up at his work when he’s trying so hard to move on and that he’s seeing multiple other people. Later that night, I texted him, I get that you’re done, and I’ve tried enough, I’m letting go now, especially since you’re seeing other people and that’s a boundary I don’t want to cross. 

He replied within a min picked a fight with me saying I was a hypocrite for losing it all just because he mentioned other people and when he used to say he has a problem with my male friends I didn’t do anything about it. I called him out that friendship and seeing people are two different things. He argued with some baseless points, and I had, had enough. So after that argument I blocked him everywhere.

1oqzei4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeHomeworkTips/comments/1oqzei4/how_to_bypass_ai_detectors_in_2025_what_actually/,How to Bypass AI Detectors in 2025? What Actually Worked for Me,"So I’ll be real… I didn’t even *mean* to trip AI detectors at first.  
 I was just trying to finish a paper faster because I had work + exams + zero brain cells left. I used ChatGPT for some structure and wording, nothing crazy and BOOM:

**Turnitin: 89% AI-generated 😐**

My professor literally wrote **“Do not submit machine-written work”** in red. That was a humbling moment.

So I started testing ways to **bypass AI detectors** without rewriting the entire thing from scratch. Here’s what I learned after like… way too many late nights:

# ❌ What DIDN’T Work

* **Just changing synonyms** → Still detected, plus sounded like Shakespeare trying to be Gen Z.  
* **Breaking sentences into little chunks** → Sometimes *more* obvious.  
* **Those “random TikTok AI bypass sites”** → They usually just introduce grammar mistakes or weird phrases like “in the modernity of time” 💀

Basically, detectors don’t care about “word swaps.”  
 They flag **sentence structure, rhythm, predictability, and probability patterns.**

# ✅ What Actually Helped

I found that the only approach that worked was to **rewrite the text into a more “human thinking pattern.”**  
 Not just wording, the *flow*.

The one tool that did this *without making my essay sound like nonsense* was **Grubby AI**.

Not saying this as an ad, more like *“I wish someone told me this sooner so I didn’t cry into my coffee at 3AM.”*

It doesn’t just rephrase sentences, it adds:

* casual variation  
* small imperfections  
* human pacing / tone

Basically how real people write when they’re tired and just trying to pass class 😭

And most importantly:

**Turnitin AI Detector Score went from 89% → 0%**

Ran it again in:

* GPTZero → ✅  
* Copyleaks → ✅  
* [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai) → ✅  Passed all of them.

If anyone wants to try the same approach:  
[ **https://grubby.ai/**](https://grubby.ai/)

# Final Tip

Even after rewriting, **add small personal touches**:

* your own examples  
* a sentence of your own wording  
* one “idk why but” style phrase or reaction  

It makes the writing feel genuinely *yours*.

# So yeah

Not impossible to bypass AI detectors…  
You just need the output to actually sound like a person who is **alive, tired, and has opinions** 😂

Hope this helps someone else avoid the “AI DETECTED” trauma 💀

I've got a rough idea of what I want, but really suck at knowing terms/products that correlate. Also a sad sap who's brain's emotional cortex keeps falsely associating a nostalgic/90s decor theme with positive connotations of childhood.. I want it to look dingy, tacky, old, like a kid decorated a treehouse.

  
**There are some things base game Sims4 couldn't properly emulate; so some corrections:**

* First desk is a desk; second is a same-size wardrobe
* The plant within the ""wardrobe"" is placeholder for my snake's terrarium
* The desk has a back grate and top shelf, the painting emulates space taken
* The window by the door is not ground level, but low and needs to remain fully accessible
* The fenced area is a balcony
* There should be another door beside the one across from the bedroom door; basement/attic access \[so it isn't extra space to utilize\]
* Power outlets are one at each end of the wider walls \[none at balcony/closet walls\]

**Theme / ""After"" notes:**

* Wood paneling wallpaper
* Faux tile flooring with tacky pattern
* Folding futon tucked into cubby/closet
* The half-wall thing beside the bed is supposed to be a small/short storage surface
* The microwave is a counter-top dishwasher, and the coffee setup is an air fryer
* Everything needs to be lifted from the floor, for Dinnerplate

**How to help / What I'm looking for:**

* Help with colors / aesthetics / ambience

They seem to have changed from the gold colored titanium plating to a dark grey version. The store I suspect is the current ""true reseller"" have only had the dark gray one in stock for a while now. I stumbled across a review someone put out where the person allegedly tried both and thought the grey performed as good as the gold while being less prone to the ""chirp"" issue the DF64 gen2 has while grinding coarser. 

**Installation:**   
I actually had to remove most of my shims for the original burrs in order to align it well. I kept the marker at 12'o'clock, and needed only 2 layers of foil to shim it into perfect alignment. The rotating burr was perfect without shims. 

**Consequences:**

1. My zero point moved a lot. Zero is now when grind n.16 is in the middle of the chute, so the burrs are a bit thicker. Good thing we can adjust the zero point indicator.
2. Grind time is slower for espresso (n.17), while not measured it feels like almost 50%. I'll try to measure and update in the future. For pourover it's about the same speed (grind level n.65)
3. ""Pre-bellows retention"" is worse for espresso, but the bellows does get most of it out. (I have removed my declumper) Again, I have yet to measure amounts but when I switched back to pourover I didn't get any real ""crosstalk"". For pourover, retention is pretty much the same. If you use the bellows a bit more you shouldn't have worse retention in the end. 
4. The sound is different. A different pitch, but not better or worse, neither quieter nor louder. 
5. The chirping issue when grinding coarse is improved by a lot, and when chirping occurs it will disappear after using the bellow, or while stopping/starting the grinder. The original burrs seemed to always chirp no matter what I did.

**Taste:**

TL:DR: They have way better clarity of flavor. Body might be lower, but I don't feel like I'm missing out. Pourover is way more interesting and nuanced,, and espresso has way more depth of flavor with better separation. 

I've only run about 250g to ""season"" the burrs, and brewed one pourover and one espresso. Both of them were not dialed in, just eyeballed. For reference the pourover was too fine at too high of a temperature, and the espresso came out to 20g in, 50g out in 16 seconds. Still, both brews instantly revealed what these burrs will provide. 

For both pourover and espresso I've had the same incorrect grind size and temperature with the old burrs, the ""undialed"" brews have the usual flaws like bitterness, lack of body, imbalance etc, but even then these new burrs show way more clarity and depth of flavor, which to me is a great sign of what's to come.

While the original burrs impressed me over my old conical grinder with what I described as going from ""only being able to perceive acidity, bitterness and body"" into ""being able to sense flavours, like fruits, berries, nuts, chocolate, earthy and woody notes"", these ""MP"" burrs feel like going from 360p to 1080p. Suddenly I went from ""sensing notes of flavours"", to actually tasting them, from expressing ""this has a hint of black currant"" into ""this tastes like a black currant"". 

As I said, I've only done two brews in total, I'll likely update my experience as I dial in my brews and the burrs get truly seasoned. For now, I'm very satisfied. 

**Final thoughts:**

These burrs are great. I paid $50 and couldn't be happier with how they perform. For me they don't come with any real downsides, only improvements. I love the flavor profile and they work great for both pourover and espresso. If you like lighter roasted coffee, especially fruity/floral ones AND you're on a budget I think these are a great option.

I’m on 50 MG of vyvanse and have been on this dose just over 2 years now.

About 5 months ago I wrote a really stressful exam I had been preparing for around 7 months. During this time I felt like I was in survival mode and studying every for 7 months the exam became my identity. To cope with stress, I picked up vaping more often, I’m not proud of it but it definitely helped relieve some stress that I was feeling. Previously I’d vape only in evenings as a ""reward"" now it’s become a daily habit.

The reason for my concern in this post is my constant fatigue, brain fog, and feelings of chronic tiredness. I thought it was something I felt during my long days of studying but during my time off I still feel it and I don’t think it was from the studying lol.

There isn’t much evidence online that nicotine and vyvanse could enhance these negative symptoms, however, for any who combines any other stimulant whether it being coffee or nicotine, is this reaction normal? Like the fatigue and tiredness should evidently fade as I quit nicotine right?

In terms of my sleep quality, it is not at its greatest I average around 7 hours per night and usually use my vape before bed. It definitely does not help sleep quality what so ever.

Anyways I’d appreciate some insight on this topic and if anyone has experienced this before please share so I know I’m not crazy lol. I am sick of this constant fatigue, and any helpful tips to get by this would be great. Thanks!",1,1762533274.0,VyvanseADHD,1,0.67,False

It’s a sunny corner-unit two bedroom in the heart of Bushwick— 5 minutes away from the L train, and in the middle of all the coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and nightlife. Only one of the bedrooms is outfitted with a bed; the other is currently an office space / studio, but could be easily converted to a 2nd bedroom because there's only a desk in there at the moment. Pets are not allowed in my building, sadly.

Rent is $3300/month. Utilities are not included. In the winter months, gas is usually $200-250, because of heating. Electricity is much lower, around $50. No washer and dryer, but the laundromat is 1 block away. The apartment will be professionally cleaned before move-in; you pay for the check-out cleaning ($140).

1oqyzoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1oqyzoz/twink_death_what_now/,"Twink Death, what now?","Hey!

I’m turning 30 next year, and the past few years have brought a lot of changes that I’ve needed time to adjust to. I quit smoking after 13 years (thank you, thank you), and suddenly my appetite came back with a vengeance. I started eating a lot more, and it definitely shows. On one hand, I love food, I love cooking, and a good meal feels like it nurtures my soul. On the other hand, I can easily go overboard. As a result, my booty has grown, I’ve got a little belly, my hair is coming in thicker, and honestly I feel like I’m slowly transforming into a little bear cub.

For context: before all this, I was the leanest and most muscular I had ever been. That was a combination of a post-breakup phase, still smoking, going to the gym six times a week, and basically living on coffee, rice, and chicken.

This is me now. The main differences are in my face and my belly.

SO MY QUESTION IS:

Should I get back to a leaner look and tighten up my diet, or should I lean into enjoying food, keep going to the gym, and embrace getting stockier and thicker?

I guess part of this comes from feeling like I’ve missed out on certain parts of gay life. I’ve never really gotten much attention from men. I think it’s because I don’t fit many stereotypes. I can be pretty masculine, but I’m not cold or standoffish. And I fluctuate from serious to flamboyant. People tend to read me as “friend energy” instead of “naughty,” even though I definitely am.

So yeah… I want to explore more in my 30s and feel more confident. I really admire bears who are cuddly and sweet but also naughty. Maybe I’m rambling, but I think I just need some friendly advice from friendly gay people.",14,1762532918.0,gay,25,0.72,False

# By: William H. Bosworth

It's now eight o' clock and little Jimmy is sent up to his room by his parents because it's little Jimmy's bed time. Along with his parents, he kneels next to his bed and starts to recite his prays. ""Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep, if I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take, if I should live for other days, I pray the lord to guide my ways. I walk through the shadow of the valley of death I shall fear no evil."" Little Jimmy has finished his prays and gets into bed. After twenty minutes has passed, little Jimmy is rolling around in bed having trouble getting to sleep. He calls out for his mother to bring him a warm glass of milk. His mother walks into his room with a glass of warm milk and says to little Jimmy, drink up, its pass your bed time. Little Jimmy does just that. He drinks the glass of milk and puts the glass on the night stand. All of a sudden from the far corner of his room, little Jimmy is beginning to hear tic, tock, tic, tock, tic, tock; but before little Jimmy gets the chance to see who is speaking, he falls asleep.

Saturday morning had arrived and little Jimmy awakes to the sound of his alarm clock going off. He gets out of bed yawning while dragging his feet to the bathroom to brush his teeth and take a shower. Once he is done, little Jimmy goes straight to the television to watch his Saturday morning cartoons. While watching his Saturday cartoons, little Jimmy notices something out of place. Its nine o' clock in the morning and little Jimmy notices that he wasn't smelling eggs cooking and toast burning. So, he gets up to see if his mom and dad are still sleeping in bed. So, he goes up stairs to check on his parents and see what the problem is. However, when little Jimmy went upstairs, he notices that not only that his parents aren't in their room, it looks as though they never slept in their bed. Not thinking twice about it, he goes back down stairs to see if his parents are in the backyard having their morning coffee. Once he is outside, once again he notices that his parents are nowhere to be found.

After checking outside, little Jimmy goes back inside and checks every room in the house looking for his parents. Room by room little Jimmy checks and soon realizes that his parents are nowhere to be found. He starts to feel very alone and very scared. Little Jimmy goes outside to one of his neighbors to see if they know where his parents are. Once he is outside, he notices something very peculiar. Little Jimmy notices that his neighborhood seems a little too quiet; especially for being a Saturday morning. Little Jimmy goes back into his house and upstairs into his room. Once he is in his room little

Jimmy closes the door, goes into a corner, and begins to cry. As soon as the first tear hits the ground, like magic, a munchkin of a man had appeared before him. When little Jimmy looks up to see who it was, little Jimmy was shocked, almost terrified by the appearance by this little man. This little munchkin of a man looks almost like he could be the creator from the dark side of the moon with its long fingers with even longer finger nails, razor sharp teeth that could slice a car door in half, pasty white skin, and long yellowish dingy hair

As little Jimmy tremble with fear in the corner of his room, he manages to ask the little munchkin for his name. In a most sinister way possible, the little munchkin replied, I'm the Sandman, the master of nightmares, and I'm here to haunt your dreams. When little Jimmy heard that, instantaneously little Jimmy became modified. Inch by inch the Sandman got closer and closer to little Jimmy's face. When their noses finally touched one another, with a whisper, the Sandman said, ""Boo"". In an instant, little Jimmy got up, ran over the Sandman and started to run down the stars screaming franticly for his mom and dad. As soon as he opens the front door to go outside, like magic, little Jimmy ends up going back in his bedroom. When little Jimmy realizes where he's at, his bedroom door violently closes behind him preventing him from living his room again. Closer and closer the Sandman comes near; more and more little Jimmy becomes scared. Tick tock, tick tock as the Sandman would say, sleeper and sleeper as little Jimmy would get. As little Jimmy eye lids become heavier and heavier, for some odd reason, little Jimmy starts to say his prayers, ""Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep, if I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take, if I should live for other days, I pray the lord to guide my ways. I walk through the valley of the shadow death I shall fear no evil. "" Over and over again swinging back and forth back and forth like little Jimmy is over come with fear; all of a sudden, coming out of the sandman's mouth, it's his mother's voice saying, Jimmy, wake up Jimmy, it's time to wake up.

In just an instant, little Jimmy wakes up as quickly as possible and starts to yell, don't eat me Sandman don't eat me. Little Jimmy sees his mother next to him and jumps into her arms crying franticly. Horrified, little Jimmy's mother asked him what the matter is. Little Jimmy told his mother about the nightmare that he had with the Sandman. As little Jimmy was telling his mother about the nightmare, his mother is just sitting there horrified about the nightmare but yet, confused. The reason for her disbelief is that after all her son is talking about the Sandman; the king of happy dreams and not the one who gives little children horrible nightmares. After little Jimmy's mother finally gets him to calm down, she sends him to the kitchen for breakfast. While little Jimmy is eating his bowl of Fruit Loops with his father, his mother goes over to the computer, to see if there's a thing as an evil Sandman. After a few minutes of looking, it turns out that there are in fact two Sandmen's. The first is a loveable huggable little man that puts kids to sleep and gives them happy thoughts while they slept. While the second, is basically the total opposite of the first. As she continues to read, it states that some people believe that the two Sandmen are brothers; while others believe that they are just two mythical creatures with the same name. As she is reading to her son, for some odd reason, little Jimmy's mother is hearing tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. She looks up only to see the Sandman jump towards her. Just before the Sandman bites her face off; little Jimmy wakes up in a horrible frantic. He looks to see if he sees the Sandman around. He gets out of bed and run-down stairs to see if his parents are down stairs. Once little Jimmy is down stairs, he sees is parents making breakfast. He then sighs in relief because he soon realizes that it was only a dream. Little Jimmy then sits down at the breakfast table and grabs his Captain Crunch Cereal box and opens it. BAM! Out of nowhere, a hand comes out of the cereal box, grabs little Jimmy by the face and pulls him through the cereal box and back into the dream world where he spends the rest of his life running from the Sandman.

I’m a 33F, recently divorced with 4 kids. I met guy 1, let’s call him James, online in the summer. He came on really strong in the beginning, very interesting guy, we had very good chemistry but he was thinking about moving away for work so I broke it off because I didn’t see the point in moving forward. He has a lot of qualities I like in a man: calm, strong, smart, he’s a Christian (this is relevant). We have pretty similar values. However, I felt like our communication was spotty and I didn’t like that he never really chose me. I felt like he held me at arm’s length because he was probably moving away. 

Then in October I came back into contact (through my work) with a guy I have known for 8 years. He used to know my ex and deeply hates him. Let’s call this guy Mark. Since the day we saw each other we have been talking every day, the conversations with him flow effortlessly, the chemistry is off the charts. It feels natural. He is consistent, he has brought me meals and flowers and written me poetry 😂. He is a dad and a very good one. We connect and get each other because he also has a crazy ex (a person I know) and I feel like he understands me. However, we do not share similar values. He is not a Christian. I also don’t fully trust him yet. I can’t see this ending in marriage, which is what I eventually want. 

Anyway, I stopped talking with James as things with Mark heated up but then James texted me again wanting to get coffee. I told James I felt like he was not ever fully choosing me and his communication wasn’t good. He apologized and said that was never his intention and it was like that because he was potentially moving. I was sleeping when he texted that and then three hours later he texted me asking me to be his girlfriend, exclusively. I haven’t responded yet and I don’t know what to do. I like both of them and I’m not ready to lose the friendship/connection I have with Mark. ",0,1762532797.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

Hey everyone, 

I’ve been running a Proxmox VE setup for a while on my HP EliteDesk 800 G5 SFF (Intel Coffee Lake CPU + iGPU UHD 630) and I’m at a point where I really need advice from people who’ve been deeper into this than I have.

My setup

Host: HP EliteDesk 800

Proxmox VE: 8.x, kernel 6.14.11-4-pve, i5 8500, 48GB RAM

ZFS pool: 2x4TB Ironwolf

IOMMU: enabled (intel\_iommu=on iommu=pt pcie\_acs\_override=downstream,multifunction)

GPU passthrough: Intel UHD 630 >> VM for Jellyfin / HW transcoding

Other VMs/CTs: Samba shares, Homarr, Ubuntu Server VM (arr stack), other service VMs (Onlyoffice mostly)

Networking: pfSense handles LAN + VPN; I access the Proxmox host remotely through VPN (OpenVPN).

What I think works

IOMMU seems fully functional (DMAR: IOMMU enabled, no faults).

GPU passthrough works great inside the VM that uses Jellyfin >> hardware transcoding confirmed with intel\_gpu\_top while playback changing quality.

System uptime is stable as long as I’m at home.

Samba shares and ZFS datasets mount fine across containers and VMs and macOS, no issues here.

The Issue

Whenever I’m out of my house, connected via VPN, and start streaming content via Jellyfin, the entire server (that is, the host PVE) crashes hard:

Web UI unreachable, SSH dead, pfSense logs show the host disappearing from the network, the crash requires physical reboot holding the power button.

No crash logs in /var/log/syslog or journalctl (so I think it’s likely a kernel hang or hardware lockup). It has now happened multiple times, always while remote, always when accessing Jellyfin. I just can’t understand how VPN traffic could cause a full Proxmox host crash.

What I’ve tried

Updated BIOS and all microcode

Tested with and without pcie\_acs\_override

Switched IOMMU modes (intel\_iommu=on, iommu=pt)

Separated IOMMU groups and blacklisted GPU drivers to isolate the GPU from the host and leave the i915 driver for the VM only.

Checked DMAR logs for GPU/PCI faults >> there are none.

Monitored thermals and RAM >> they are stable.

Disabled Proxmox subscription popup (not related but done)

Network isolation and firewall rules all good in pfSense.

At this point I’m honestly thinking of dropping Proxmox entirely and moving to Ubuntu Server + Docker + ZFS: This only happens when streaming remotely (VPN). Host uptime has been great unless I start remote streaming.

Don’t skip hydration — aim for around 2 litres of water daily, even at weekends.

Enjoy the moments — focus on taste and company rather than portion size.

It’s okay to have treats — the difference now is mindfulness, not restriction.

1oqyuq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1oqyuq7/questions_about_this_recipe/,Questions about this recipe,"The recipe is for Chocolate Sugar Cookies

 1 2/3 cup (207g) all-purpose flour (\*see notes below)  
• 1 tsp baking soda  
• ½ tsp salt  
• ¼ tsp espresso or ½ tsp instant coffee powder (optional but recommended)  
• 1/3 cup + ¼ cup (53g) cocoa powder (preferably dutch-processed)  
• ¾ cup (168g) unsalted butter (room temperature)  
• 1 ¼ cup (175g) light brown sugar  
• 1 medium whole egg + 1 egg yolk (room temperature)  
• 1 tsp vanilla extract  
• 1/3 cup (70g) white sugar (for coating)

Servings: 18 cookies  


My questions:

1. I want to make 9 cookies, so I need to cut each portion in half. However, I’m unsure about the eggs. The recipe calls for one whole egg and one egg with just the yolk. Should I use 1 regular egg or a egg yolk.

2. Can I substitute margarine for butter? Also the margarine I have is salted and flavored with sweet buttercream.

3.I only have gluten-free cocoa powder, so can I substitute that for Dutch-processed cocoa powder?

My ex (23F) said that I(24M) accused her of cheating. If that is the case, how to deal with things and communicate in the future?","Hello everyone.

I'll only describe this one situation of the breakup of the long distance relationship(6months, known eachother for over a year) because I'd like to know if this isolated part is considered a cheating accusation, without any of the emotional turmoil that lead to it:

After a very taxing breakup talk, I felt some emotions coming up.

She said that she loved me, but that we can't be together. But during the talk, it didn't feel like she was even willing to try to figure out things together or work on it anymore.

So the question in me arose ""Did she already move on? If so, why? How?""

My mind was racing and at some point, an insecurity came up. She was already feeling less and less energetic during some time before the breakup happened. She also told me about a guy that wanted to grab a coffee with her before the breakup.

My thought was that maybe she wanted to break up earlier, but didn't have the strength to tell me before. Then, when the guy asked to grab a coffee, she decided to take him up on that offer to figure out if an in-person relationship really is what she wants and needs right now to be happier or if that is just something her mind was making up during a stressful phase. And when that was something that felt right to her, when she got confirmation that this was something that would really make her happy, she needed to gather the strength to finally break things off with me.

For me, it wasn't about the guy. It could have been anyone, but I want to be as honest here as I was with her: I could have imagined her thinking of the guy as nice and maybe even got a little interested in him after they met. After all, if she did this, the relationship would have mentally been over for her at that time.

But that was not my point. For me, the guy was just a way for her to assure that an in-person relationship really is what she needed. It could have been anyone.

I never could have imagined that she would have went to the meeting if she had feelings for the guy already. The main question that I had was if she had already checked the relationship off.

I didn't even think of this as very likely and at least I was able to communicate that as well.

What I wasn't able to communicate is that I thought that I should be honest & open with my partner as soon as these thoughts come up, so we can talk about it and work on things before thoughts like these even have the chance to foster. I could have definitely said nothing, as for me it wasn't even a big deal.

I could have never imagined her having an affair, be it emotionally or physically, after all. However, I knew that while she did not. I should have realized that things like these need way better handling and should not be talked about in such a emotionally loaded situation.

For me, the situation was over when she said ""nope"". That was all I needed, as for me, there was no real trust issue there. I just wanted to communicate that I had gotten insecure and that I had a bad thought. I told her that it was over for me with that and that all is well for me then.

\-----

So, at that time, it didn't even appear to me as cheating really. Bad behaviour? Yes. But cheating? I knew that having this thought was bad and that I was thinking something I shouldn't and didn't want to about my partner. That is why I tried to communicate. Everything else would have felt like I am hiding something from my partner.

But now I am not so sure anymore. Did I accuse her of cheating?

And if so, how would you handle a situation where thoughts like this come to your mind? I still feel like not telling feels like I'm hiding something. Something I shouldn't. I was and am always a big supporter of open and honest communication. For me, that is the only way for a relationship to last. But is this something one should not bring up? 

  
TLDR;

I asked my ex if she met with a guy to figure out if an in-person relationship is what she really needs.",1,1762532567.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False
