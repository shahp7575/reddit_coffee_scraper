Now that you understand why NordVPN is an excellent choice for securing your online privacy, let’s talk about the **NordVPN discount code** that’s making waves on Reddit in 2025.

# Step 1: Visit the NordVPN Reddit Deal Thread

To find the latest and most up-to-date discount codes for NordVPN, head over to Reddit. Subreddits like r/VPN and r/Deals are great places to look for **user-shared NordVPN promo codes**. In 2025, users are reporting a **75% off discount code** that slashes the price significantly.

# Step 2: Copy the Code

Once you find the 75% off NordVPN discount code on Reddit, copy it to your clipboard. These codes are often posted by verified users who have tested the discounts themselves, ensuring they work.

# Step 3: Visit the NordVPN Website

Go to the official **NordVPN website** and click on the **Sign Up** button. Choose the subscription plan that best suits your needs. Typically, the longer you commit to, the greater the discount you’ll receive.

# Why Reddit Is the Best Place for VPN Deals

Reddit is home to many **tech enthusiasts** and **privacy advocates**, and its active communities are always on the lookout for the best deals. The r/VPN and r/Deals subreddits are particularly useful for finding verified NordVPN discount codes, as they allow users to share their experiences and validate promo codes before recommending them. This makes it a reliable platform for finding **NordVPN discount codes** and other online security deals.

# What to Look for When Using a Discount Code

While a 75% off discount code is an incredible offer, there are a few things you should consider before making the purchase:

# 1. Check the Expiry Date

Discount codes often have expiration dates, so make sure the code you found on Reddit is still valid for use in 2025. Some codes may be limited to a specific time frame or a certain number of redemptions.

# 2. Compare Subscription Plans

NordVPN offers several subscription plans, including **monthly**, **1-year**, and **2-year** options. The longer subscription plans generally offer the best value, and using the 75% off discount will make the longer plans even more affordable.

# 3. Look for Additional Promotions

NordVPN often runs additional promotions or deals that can be stacked with the discount code. Be sure to check for any ongoing sales or free trials, which may enhance the value of your subscription.

# Why Is Online Privacy So Important in 2025?

As we move further into the 2020s, online privacy continues to be under threat from various sources. Here’s why using NordVPN in 2025 is a must:

# 1. Increasing Cybersecurity Threats

Cyberattacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, with personal data being sold on the dark web. A VPN like NordVPN ensures that your sensitive data stays safe.

# 2. Government Surveillance

Governments around the world are becoming more aggressive in monitoring online activities. A VPN can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, providing an extra layer of anonymity.

# 3. Protection on Public Wi-Fi

Using public Wi-Fi networks in places like coffee shops, airports, or hotels can put your personal information at risk. NordVPN’s encryption ensures that your online activities are safe even on unsecured networks.

# 4. Geo-Restriction Circumvention

Many streaming services and websites restrict access based on your geographic location. With NordVPN, you can mask your location and access content from any part of the world, expanding your online freedom.

# Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the 75% Off NordVPN Discount Code!

If you’re looking to enhance your online security and privacy without breaking the bank, the **75% off NordVPN discount code** shared by Reddit users in 2025 is a deal you don’t want to miss.

That said I have taught myself to be a at home chef so I can keep the foods that trigger out of my dite.  Always scouting the interwebs for onion free recipes is a chore and have found out that Gemini will do it for me.

I kid you not it has changed my whole take on cooking and it is so easy now I feel like I was in the stoneage for all these years.

If you want to try it download google Gemini off play store/apple store and hit the live mode button.  You can ask it for recipes for whatever your wanting.  But the holy crap moment really came when I figured out you can just tell it what ingredients you have in the house and it will create a recipe for you.  I just use live mode, tell it what I want or what I have in the house, we figure out something, hit the back button to see our chat log then copy paste the recipe it made to notes to print out.  Can even tell it you have IC and will remember what you don't like to eat.",1,1733055481.0,Interstitialcystitis,0,1.0,False

I’ve read recently [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/s/6Wr3Oex8XZ) and so I started to wonder to do the same on my DF64v.
This morning I worked on it and it was a success! It has been quite easy, just disassembled the grinder from the bottom and then I wired the declumper to the ground line. All the work took somewhere around 1h, going slowly trying to not fuck up and understanding how to do it at its best.
I really don’t get why this wasn’t done by default or why fancy ionizers are needed at all.

In the first comment you can see some pics, I post here the video of the final result.
I tested on some coffee and the result is impressing! I did also a retention test: 20.1g in, 20.05g out (the scale was oscillating between .0 and .1) grinding at 1200 rpm. I’m really impressed!

I was never bothered by doing RDT, but lately I found the process a bit tedious so I’m lunching myself on a small project for adding the grind-by-weight (GBW) functionality to the grinder. For obvious reasons, with the crazy amount of static that was there before integrating the GBW would not be possible.

It is not good for man to be alone. 

That’s quite a statement. Taken in context, it’s jarring. God creates the universe and each day ends with “and God saw that it was good.” At the end, when all was created God rested and declared the whole thing very good. Then we are told that it — creation — man’s state — is NOT good, we should not be alone. We need companionship, connection, man is incomplete without a wife. 

Perhaps Adam didn’t know he had a need. Perhaps God brought the animals, male and female by, under the guise of finding a helpmeet (a completer) so Adam would realize he had a need. I can’t imagine God creating Adam and placing him in Eden and having him whining and crying. Adam was content in paradise until God showed him his need. 

The next step is crucial. 

As I type this, I have a need for another cup of coffee. And I’ll get my fat ass up from my chair and pour another cup. I can, as a man with a free will, manipulate my environment for all sorts of good things — and more than a few less than good things, and even an evil thing or two. It’s a bit chilly in the house this morning so I’m gonna bump the thermostat up a bit and turn the heat on. Or put my slippers on. We humans can — in some cases — manipulate and control our destinies. At our own peril. And in most cases we are called to work on and for all sorts of things. Our free will is a blessing and a curse. But that’s a whole nother topic for another day. 

I firmly believe that God has a helpmeet, a completer, a wife specifically for you and you alone and if you are out there manipulating the situation, you’re gonna end up with a baboon or a chimpanzee. 

God showed Adam his need and didn’t tell him to run around the garden, climb some trees, shake some bushes, and take out an ad on plentyofchicks dot com. 

Adam went to sleep. 

And God took from his side, and created the perfect bride for him. Eve completed him. 

What is the lesson? 

Go to sleep. You have a need. You wouldn’t be reading this if you weren’t keenly aware of that need. You’ve tried meeting that need in some pretty sick ways (me too). 

Let God put you and that perfect bride for you together. Don’t manipulate the situation. She will show up when you’re ready. If she isn’t there, that only tells me you’re not ready. And neither is she. Give it time. God gives us promises and we must wait for Him to fulfill them. Our manipulations cause trouble. ",1,1733055203.0,NoFapChristians,0,1.0,False

She lives with her parents and is difficult to date. However when we started dating we made it work, it worked for about 6 months then things started to change. One of the reasons it’s been working is because we see each other every day at work. However at work it’s formal, it’s not really dating. After work we used to always take walks and chat and perhaps do something quick like take a coffee. Now that’s not working because she has to get her kid from kindergarten. I totally understand that. But she is also very busy at the weekends and we have maybe 1-2 real one on one dates a month. It used to be better, we used to date more. Now this has been like this since August. I have had talks with her and she is saying she understands and seems understanding and somethings we’ve talked about have gotten better. But we still are barely dating. I feel like shit tbh because my needs aren’t met and I love her and the last thing I want is to break up.

1h41x6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesfromtheDogHouse/comments/1h41x6r/dog_shat_our_toddlers_room_full/,Dog Shat Our Toddlers Room Full,"Yes you read that correctly. I come home from a LONG day of running errands with my toddler. 
I had to leave before my partner, and he is a complete and total dog obsessor. So naturally, he lets the dog run loose in the damn house while I’m gone, that way I’ll have at LEAST 20 mins worth of hair to vacuum up when I get home so our child can have a clean environment to play in. 

He has a 10 year old very hairy and very large black German shepherd in our home. The dog is “highly trained” as my partner says, but I could agree less. 

We have a huge house, and we put up a baby gate in the doorway to one of the old dining room areas of the house, so this stupid beast literally has a “dog apartment” in our home. She even has her own couch smh. And a fucking coffee table bc my partner insists it HAS to resemble a living room in there so she feels “at home” lmfaooo.

She stays behind the baby gate in her giant room aka entire back half of our home that we can’t utilize. Only at night when our toddler goes to bed with the door closed is when he lets the dog out from behind the baby gate, or when we leave the house for longer than an hour because “the dog is our security” 🙄🙄


So now that you got the backstory- I left before my partner -and I usually leave the dog locked in the back, idc how long I’m gone. That way I’m not spending 30+ mins picking up kids toys, ensuring things the dog can get to and destroy is put away, clearing a space for the elephant sized beast to trample though and coat in filth and hair. So I can come home and spend another 20-30 mins vacuuming up hair and filth and wiping waxy dog back off the furniture and walls. 

Of course I had to leave first so my nutter partner left the baby gate open for the beast to run loose in the house. I told him to make sure all bedroom doors were closed and that all kids toys were off the floor and any stuffies out of the dogs reach.
 
Came home and my partner had half assed everything. Toys were strewn and looked like he had just kicked them into the corners instead of picking them up. The dog instantly ran off to her room and I went back there to close the gate and she was absolutely cowering and had her head and ears down like she did something wrong. I started smelling shit. I was like oh fuck no. So I did an inspection of the entire house and came to my daughter’s room and saw the door standing wide open. 

I open our daughter’s room and the entire floor is COVERED in liquid shit from one end of the room to the other. One giant pile of shit in the middle and the rest of the room just giant piles of liquid shit. We have CARPET BY THE WAY.

I was absolutely livid and I do not condone abuse but I was so fucking PISSED OFF I went on a rampage calling my partner at work and cussed him out BAD. Told him he’s cleaning it when he gets home and was being super petty and sending him expensive things to buy to clean the mess with.

My main concern was sanitation. How am I going to get these germs from this filthy liquid dog shit out of my 3 year old child’s carpet? So she can have a healthy and clean and sanitary environment to play in? She was absolutely distraught over not being able to go to her room to play and she cried and whined the whole time until my partner finally got off work early and hit up the store for enzyme cleaner.

He wasn’t mad and of course he gets home and goes to the dog and starts babying it DID YOU GET INTO SOMETHING BABY OH POOR BABY IS SICK HER TUMMY ISNT FEELING WELL like what the actual FUCK

I told him this can’t keep happening and if it happened again that the dog is to stay behind the gate even when we leave the house and he fucking FLIPPED HIS SHIT and screamed at me
This is not up for discussion you’ve done barricaded my DOG in the back where I never get to see her or interact with her, you this you that, blaming me for everything and putting this fucking dog on a pedestal. 

Miraculously that expensive cleaner he bought worked and we got the smell out and was able to put my daughter to bed (I even slept in there with her last night in a pile of blankets bc I felt so bad about her sleeping in what was once a cesspool of filth) it didn’t stink and doesn’t. It’s all clean now but that’s not the fucking point.

I’m definitely going to douse the carpets with Lysol antibacterial spray idc if they’re meant for carpet or not. Dog shit the size of a pile of elephant shit isn’t meant for the carpet either but here we are.

I’m more pissed that this man seems to care more about his old ass filthy fucking gorilla big back dog than he cares about his own child and the mother of his child.

He’s a narcissist so he sees it as me bitching and raising Hell and shunning his precious royalty queen of a dog 🙄

 This dog has been the root of 99.9999 percent of any of our fighting or arguing and he’s made compromises (the baby gate) but any advice on how to get the germs out so I can feel at least some peace?

I’m an extreme germophobe and I do NOT want my daughter playing in her room until ME MYSELF AND I go in there and PROPERLY sanitize bc I don’t trust my partners dog nutter half assed “cleaning” skills

Also feel free to share similar experiences and how you handled it. I want this dog to be permanently behind this baby gate and not allowed into our living space AT ALL. I’m so sick of everything!

And as bad as it sounds, I’m IMPATIENTLY waiting on the end of this beast’s lifespan which I’m hoping is sooner than later. A large breed 10 year old dog that NEVER exercises and eats treats all day? Hoping that’ll knock some years off I’m so ready for this disgrace of an animal to be out of my home for good!

Sorry for such a long post. This is my safe space of like minded people I can vent to and share experiences with and not get shunned for it. Ily all ❤️ suffering together lol ",2,1733054884.0,TalesfromtheDogHouse,0,1.0,False

Kinda confirms shes the type person who thinks way too much. Her new living environment changes this for sum reason

She is dizzied by all the changes in nature she observes day by day and that shows she was always stagnant 

46
Although she walks in the forest daily she feels estranged from it, as though she is separated from it completely, an outsider looking in, as she has been throughout her life. This forest represents how shes gone through life. As an outsider, always looking in and thinking to herself, always believing or preparing for the worst

56-57

She rly likes organized things. She loves the town from a distance because of how organized she says. I interpret that as how predictable it is. She said she memorized the days of work, rests, feats, market days, etcetc, of that town. To her it must feel like a game of clash of clans ir campfire 2. Probably campfire 2. You know when ppl will come out, who, where theyll go, what job they’ll work, how they feel, what there good at. Its orderly. Even the occasional disorder when a stray wolf gets past the hunters and into the down is orderly because it is expected to happen here and there. Of course in campfire 2 i know all this because i set those villagers to do those things and ik there stats but she knows it from observation. This is another example of her looking outwards ig? Observing the town not in obedience like in childhood or for obedience, but out of curiosity and eventually love for its order


Page 59:
She says there is so much people have to live up to in terms of doing good deeds. So many that you cant reasonably expect them to. And the failure to do these things becomes a metonymy, meaning to refer to something using a word tbat describes one of its qualities. The crown is the quality of a king/kingdom/royal family so swearing allegiance to the crown is a metonymy as you refer to the previously listed royal things as one of their qualities, the crown. The author is essentially telling us that the failures we have (either in terms of good deeds or jst in general) become a metonymy for us, we are see as our failures, it secretly defines us to an extent by those around us. The church, she says, is different. Though she may not be religious it is a place where these failures are assumed. Everyone in the church is christian and believes and activity admit that they themselves begin for sin or in this context failure. So while one is still defines by their failure the church is a place where this is almost a good thing, or is rather an accepted thing. You walk in the church and those around you EXPECT the failure and you expect theres because it is a place to take these failures and uproot them.

Brother told sister that she could perhaps for once involve herself in things around her. Again pointing to her being someone whos always inside her own head thinking too much be it about others or herself but never getting close no matter the interest she finds just as she handled her love for the down but her refusal to go down to it until needed

Page 62:

The rise of cafes, there fall, and there rise once again. This new rise coming from a craving of nostalgia according to our narrator. The yearning for a landline, the want for a video store smell, etc etc. She observes this inside herself and states she desperately wants to sit within it but doesn’t have the confidence. She explicitly states she doesn’t have the confidence. She says she views it from the outside appearing as a haven from the age of anxiety.

83-85

She details how when someone who shows her any level of kindness. Even the bare minimum. She becomes devoted to them. This probably shows how in her home life she was always “wrong” and in probably most her life in general she was “wrong” so to hear someone, anyone, say a positive about her to any level mustve been amazing. 

97-100:
Her job or volunteer job makes her very happy. It’s scooping up shit but yet it allows her to feel useful. It allows her to feel like the area shes living in, that she is enjoying throughly, wasnt just handed to her but given. If i need to expand more on this later, page 66 where she thinks she deserves to die for writing her name on the volunteer form explains her mentality here exactly I think?

108:

Confirms she believes she needs to kill her pride, kill her sense of self, kill her self love and respect. Ego death

Page 109-110


The author reflects on the limitations of modern progress, the hollowness of relying solely on knowledge, and the exploitation within societal systems. They contrast this with a more grounded, familial view of the world, suggesting that modernity's promises—choice, individuality, and progress—are often vain and superficial compared to deeper connections and truths.

It appeares she has had a break thru in her thinking. Near the end if 112 she literally says acquired the ability to think again. While she is a big thinker already i think this means her break thru from 109-111 has let her see that ego death is a bad thing

Page 118- 120

It finally kinda hit her that not everything has to do w her. Maybe the silence in the cafe predated her arrival. Kinda like how ppl w/ social anxiety seem to think every chuckle, every laugh, every whisper, is about then.

121:

She pointed to a moms drink and weirdly the mom cries. It felt like i missed like a billion chapters but i assume they all think she a witch or sum. Either way our mc didnt care. Character development. So far this whole book as been her journey. Validating, finding, and consolidating her ego, her sense of self. She finally asks. “What have i done wrong.” And to that no answer can be given but nothing.


Page 128:

Rmbr all that built up, what do you call it? Courage? Her newly born ego? Well it mightve just been smashed. It probably began when she had to leave the cafe, right after her new ego was finally complete, it began to be damaged. It was essentially confirmed that the townspeople fear her in a sense. And when they were throwing her dolls away? It confirmed it to her. They hated her. It did concern her, the silence was of her doing 


Page 130:

Well yea she jst said she should always remain “outside” (outsider looking in). The cafe, the poip shovelling, the kindness to others, were all her attempts at going in. And she got rejected

Page 130:

Shes still going to the farm tho. Desperately wanting to prove to her brother that she got it alllll in control. She wants to prove to him thats shes quote “been obedient”. She definitely craves validation from big bro 

135:

She is SO obedient to her brother wtf. As she said early in the story she KNOWS what he (they) need before they even say. Like she prepeared him food of his taste of his portion sizing with consideration to the fact he had jst been on a long travel

136:

She knows her brother. Anything time he is slightly suspicious that she has an ulterior motive. That she cant be THIS obedient still. She bows her head, softens her voice, and sweetens her looks 

On a sad note at the end of this page she said she forgot about how the grass grows, the straw dolls she made. Basically she is saying with the return of her brother, she has reset. All the development she has undergone she claims has been forgotten. She says on quote “i tried to reach out, something I should have never done” she tried reaching out over history but realizes she shouldve stayed in. I dont think this regression will last


167:
She has perfected obedience. Her brother, whatever illness had struck him, now was being cared for in excesses by her. Her perfect obedience. Her study completed. Adhering to his lack of will. But it doesnt feel like this to me. It feels like shes doing something twisted for herself. That she could not be happier at her brother’s state. Her routine and schedule built around him


181:

Taking his phone??? I get it now (i understand it now). She is intentionally or unintentionally trying to live her life through him. 




Critique:

Hi guys! This is my first post here so im not too well versed in any rules, if I break one please lmk 🙏

Anyway, I just finished this book, a study for obedience, and im confused. Like really confused. Like, i enjoyed the book (i think) but, and this is coming from a grade 12 student so take this with a grain of salt, the actually writing, like the grammar, structure, flow, etc, were terrible. Super clunky sentences, I was FREQUENTLY (as in every few lines) counting sentences with 5 plus commas and wayyy too many words per comma. It felt like the author really wanted to be all mysterious, which is fine, but everything is bad in excess and it feels like a good 70% (and this is not an exaggerated figure) of the book I could not easily understand. And I dont mean like “oh i had to do an in depth analysis on a few sentances”. No, I mean like every few sentences and sometimes every other sentence the author shoved as many metaphors, symbols, overly complicated words that didnt add to the story or sentence, commas, sometimes bad grammar (I think), and more.

This all combined to make even attempting to read this a challenge for me. To add on, not only was the grammatical structure seemingly bad for me, the stories structure was weird too. For the most part it was alright, but too often was a given point in the story riddled with side tangents and flashbacks. I understand that is an intrinsic part of the main characters Personality but coupled with the grammar discussed above and I had even more trouble reading. To give you a very-generous example of what issues were like, sentences like this were painfully frequent:

 “my dog, despite it being well taken care of and looked after frequently, something I did not have the luxury of receiving frequently as a child, instead often being met with a sort of fearful distance from all those around me, perhaps due to my quiet nature, often preferring to stay inside myself rather then dare to venture outwards. I mean, it’s safer to simply observe and learn what others want, to live in complete servitude of others. Was often hungry, always looking at the food I was given.” 


Now I dont know if I expressed what I was reading correctly in the paragraph I threw up. But the writer kept doing what I did above, having the main point (we’ll call A) in a sentence and having every letter in the alphabet in between A and the conclusion of the main point (B). Couple that with metaphors and symbols which are 100% used in excess. An amount I could never hope to replicate in the paragraph above, so I just opted to omit them. And words which I didnt even know existed. Like I like to think I have a decent vocabulary, more intuitive then anything, but these words the author threw around, again, in excess, made it impossible for me to read. 

I did actually finish the book just now and, side note, it’s 6 am and im on my 2nd cup of coffee so forgive any grammar mistakes I make in this post. 


For anyone thats read the book, PLEASE help me understand what I read. I know the book has ties to antisemitism but from what I see other people online saying the ties to antisemitism are wayy more then I was able to pick up on. I understand most of it is implicitly stated with how the townsfolk treat the MC but for me, in the context of the story, the main thing the author was trying to showcase with the dislike for the MC was her personality, her beliefs. What she thought and how it affected others. And how her thought process could be completely wrong. How her personality wasnt a deterrent and it was simply her imagination. This part of the story I liked. It was really interesting. I like how for a VERY brief period, the MC seemed to be recovering from what I’ll call her “ego death”. The death of her sense of self which occurred early into childhood it seems. She seemed to have faced a realization (one which for the reasons previously mentioned I could not fully interpret), which put her in a mindset of “maybe the silence when I walk into a cafe existed before me”. Only then to be shattered when she found this wasn’t the truth (it was cause she’s jewish right?). She then regrets ever tryna be “open” and comes to the conclusion she can only exist “closed” from everyone, away, outside looking in. I did like this part, her personality and beliefs were very fun to see and I was able to understand I think around 70% of her. Again for the rest of the story, 🤷‍♂️. 

Some of the things I didnt understand off the top of my head

- she mentioned for a period of time in her life she wanted to help ppl, I didnt understand if she was like a suicide hotline type person or something?

- that bit about the 14 year old on a hospital bed right after, which is then followed by her hating on men. Felt like I missed a page. Did these men, or this one guy she was describing, do something to this 14 year old. Was it simply a like imagination thing she made us see for the sake of explaining her mind at the time?

- wtf happened to the brother. He got sick, then the sister basically took over his life in a really creepy way. Surprisingly it was creepy enough to give me a bit of that horror thrill though it was unintended I believe. Something about how she pretend to be obedient in my mind but this is exactly how she wants to live her life. A perfect schedule around someone else. Getting to talk to and interact with the dog. Putting all her energy in someone who doesnt speak back. Part of me thinks she poisoned him??

- whatttt was that church scene. The little pig heads??? Like okay. So she is on a walk for wtv reason, reaches the top of a hill (?) if I remember. Is then approached by 2 ppl from the town wearing white. For some reason, unless I missed a page of a paragraph, she starts leading THEM to the church as if they’re lost???  Like how did she know where they wanted to go no words were or could be exchanged. And then even though shes leading them it feels like the author meant to say they led her? Then she is presented with her little straw men she made (ik its not straw but oh well) and other things of significance like the sows dead children, why??? The ewes dead lamb too for some reason. It felt like a dream segment. 

- she briefly mentioned a ruined carved above their door. Never brought up again

- wtf was up with the women and her dog? So our MC decides the best course of action is to just lie and agree with the women that her dog was impregnated by the castrated bert, this makes sense with our MC’s personality and thoughts at the time but why did this make the women and dog stop talking. Completely ignoring our MC’s presence. Our MC who then goes on feeling bad that she destroyed this womens world view, or infringed upon it, or something like that?? How?? It doesnt make sense i genuinely think I read it wrong


Anyway yea confusing book. Needed to rant. I like talking about stuff I read, I did actually enjoy this all things aside. I really liked 2 things in particular. Early in the book the love she has for the village and its order from afar. I can only imagine it felt like Clash of Clans or any other similar simulation type of game. Being able to observe a town from afar. Maybe sims? Being but with less control. Knowing exactly when work starts, when it ends, feats, celebrations, etc. i also LOVED her thoughts on the church. I am in no ways religious but the perspective was so cool to me. People are associated with their failures all too often. It
Becomes a metonymy (my favourite new word picked up from the book) for that person. In church however, this is all expected and accepted and wanted. It is a place where the ground assumption is that your very first moments of existence are failure (sin) and this is a place to be cleansed of that failure. Thats why everyone is there. And therefor it is not a thing to be shamed
Of.

Thanks for reading my ted talk. Lmk if my thoughts on the book are mine alone. And if possible please try helping in the clarification of wtv I just read",0,1733054209.0,literature,0,0.17,False
1h41qn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1h41qn0/issues_with_german_telekom/,Issues with German Telekom?,"Hello,

I am based in Germany and have issues with my Sonos. I ask myself if this is caused by my provider Deutsche Telekom (250Mbit VDSL).

Sonos consists of a arc, beam and move. As well the arc has a sub 2 and two One SL attached. Additionally there are two Roam 2. everything is connected via Ubiquity LAN or WIFI. Arc and Beam are wired. All others are on a 5Ghz network.

Now the issues:
- since the big update, responsiveness of the system is a nightmare. It seems like Sonos is hosting in AWS and their setup isn’t performing well in the morning (i know, they would already have been aware of that but currently I’m not sure anymore in regards to their performance). It is also well known, that Telekom’s Peering behavior is even worse than Sonos‘ app and there are pleating of issues with services outside of the Telekom network. 
- secondly Alexa does everything I‘m telling her, like switching on my Coffee machine. But it is not playing music from any service. It says „Playing xyz from Amazon Music“ but then there is silence. This happens with any music service even after reseting the speaker and removing/adding Alexa from/to it.

Is there anybody with similar issues to mine? I’ve played around with different DNS services (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, 9.9.9.9 openDNS) but that didn’t change anything (even after several days of keeping it on a different DNS service and rebooting the speakers.

I’m clueless right know and seek some ideas where to troubleshoot. The Ubiquity network is flat. I’ve removed all vLANs and just run the default network though a 24 Port PoE sticht, some U6+ and a UCG Max. The Max does PPPoE Dial up through a AVM 7530AX that solely acts as modem.

I sat down and gave him a quick explainer, and then started putting together some material I could have him read and refer to if he forgot later on. 

As I was putting it together (I'm in tech and have decent experience in the industry, plus have friends I collaborate with), I also did a bit more research into news and trends around cybercrime targeting individuals, small business owners, creators and the like. 

The more you read, the more worried you get! And this isn't sensational - it's just plain facts. The level of sophistication in scams, social engineering and such attacks that target basic human vulnerabilities is CRAZY. And something like 3 out of 4 attacks relied purely on things like this rather than malware. Which means your antivirus, VPNs, etc are not going to cut it.

There is a lack of clear, actionable information online that puts this together (i.e. resources for individual cybersecurity) in a way that's easy for a busy person to follow. So I put together this: [https://www.purplehawk.org/starter-guide](https://www.purplehawk.org/starter-guide).

I’m a 36-year-old woman from Central Europe whose mother tongue is German, looking for a partner to share life’s ups, downs, and all the in-betweens. Let me be upfront: I’m not here for friendship but to find someone who’s ready for a meaningful connection. If we realize we don’t fit romantically, friendship is a lovely fallback, but my intention is clear—I’m searching for my person.



**A little about me:**

I’m tall (185 cm/6’1”), curvy, and have a sharp sense of humor that keeps people on their toes. My love for audiobooks, especially crime thrillers, means I’m often solving fictional mysteries (occasionally getting it wrong). When I’m not lost in an audiobook, I enjoy hiking with my mischievous dachshund, exploring new places, or unwinding with knitting and a cup of coffee or tea.



Travel is my big passion, especially to northern regions. I’m not the type to spend 10 days roasting on a beach; I’d rather explore cities, soak up the sea breeze, or find hidden gems off the beaten path. That said, I equally appreciate a cozy night at home.



**A few practical details:**

I’ve never been married, don’t have kids, and am not looking to change that. Physical appearance doesn’t matter much to me—I’m drawn to intelligence, wit, and meaningful conversations that can go in any direction. I’m looking for someone who can connect with me openly and consistently. Sporadic “Hi” messages every other week aren’t my thing—I want a genuine connection.



If this resonates with you and you’re up for sharing your story, send me a message! And please, no one-liners; I’d appreciate if you told me something about yourself.



Looking forward to hearing from you!

The pizza lived up to the hype. fresh veggies, cheese that melts in your mouth, and a thin crust that was just right.

1h41ktw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1h41ktw/i_hate_my_own_bloodline/,I HATE MY OWN BLOODLINE,"I HATE MY OWN BLOODLINE  
  
I want to share my story. I’m a 25-year-old man who feels depressed and disconnected from my own bloodline. I’ve never kissed a girl or held her hand, and maybe that’s because I vowed to myself not to marry unless I became filthy rich as I have seen the true meaning of poverty. Or maybe it’s because I feel ugly as hell, and girls see me as a creep. Either way, I’m a porn addict who has never spoken to a girl.  
  
Here's my story:  
  
I come from a wealthy family one that once owned an entire city capable of hosting 20,000 people, complete with farms, shops, and small craftsmen's workshops. We weren't nobles or ruling class, but rather merchants and landlords. My ancestors had it all: wealth, power, and respect.  
  
However, there’s a missing chapter in my family’s history. My great-grandfather, whom we'll refer to as the first letter of his name “G,” was born in 1906 and died around 1960. He squandered the family fortune on nothing but hedonism. He had 43 known children with multiple women, spent all his inheritance on lavish living, and when he met women he liked, he showered them with gifts (mostly gold) just to spend a night with them.  
No one know how ""G"" ended up with all the wealth, altho there was some people who should have the wealth but for some reason they didn't, this guy got everything when he was just 3 or 5.  
  
When he finally passed away, he had depleted most of the family fortune, leaving his many grandchildren to fight over scraps. Each ended up with a small house, a shop, or a tiny farm.  
  
You'd think they would have learned a lesson. You'd imagine they wouldn't have any children they couldn't support. But no.  
My grandfather witnessed the decline and yet had 12 kids, leaving them only with a house and a small shop, Now you might wonder how he got a small shop and a house together? Well inbreeding make wonders. After he passed, his family split what little remained, and they still got almost nothing of the small fortune he accumulated. Did they learn from this? Absolutely not.   
  
My father went on to have nine children, including me. I was born while we were deep in debt, and we had to move to another country when I was three. We had nothing left in our home country but debt, and we still don't have anything here either. Additionally, due to legal issues, I can't work until I pay around $15,000, which keeps increasing yearly (a debt of the result of hospital bills and lawyer fees). The minimum wage here is $475, while transportation alone costs almost $130.  
  
I can’t work officially until I pay off that debt, and the only jobs I can find are side hustles that barely cover my commuting costs. Sometimes, I get lucky and find someone who will let me work for a few months before they cut me loose by asking me to be in their records officially, and I can't do that obviously unless I pay the debt.  
  
I’ve had countless ideas to become wealthy, some of them been scratch because someone else did it first and got rich of it. It makes me question if I’m just unlucky or if I did something wrong in a past life and am paying for it now. Each idea I come up with requires money that I don’t have, and my side hustles aren't enough to get me started. I’ve tried everything: game development, website development, video editing for memes—nothing ever worked. The problem is that I can't do anything outside the realm of PC and internet-related ""jobs"" until I pay off that enormous debt and those PC and internet ""jobs"" are the most disheartening aspect of my life; I feel even more depressed working on a computer than I would doing actual labor.  
  
Sometimes, when I feel lonely, I wonder if that piece of garbage ""G"" ever felt lonely. When I go hungry and can't afford food, I ponder if he ever felt hunger. When I run out of cigarettes and can’t buy a new pack, I think if he ever experienced deprivation. When I become depressed, I question if ""G"" ever felt anything less than happiness. When I feel loneliness and resort to cheap coping methods known as porn, I can't help but wonder if that bastard ever felt lonely.  
  
There’s a reason why 99% of wealthy families can’t keep their wealth beyond three generations. There’s always that one piece of garbage who ruins it for everyone. ""G"" wreaked havoc on his own grandchildren in a way they could never recover from.  
  
So, why am I depressed? It's not just because I’m poor and in debt for reasons beyond my control. It’s the disconnection from this cursed bloodline. None of my relatives think the way I do; most of them are lazy, ignorant, and have nothing in common with me, including my own father. After all, most people who share my last name are descendants of ""G,"" and the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.  
  
This disconnection has become a major issue. I feel increasingly lonely, especially since I have no friends in this life and now feel estranged from my relatives as well. Loneliness is the root of my depression, and I can't seem to fix it because I don’t know how to make friends.  
The only time I ever felt less lonely was a year ago in a coffee shop   
While sitting there, a girl approached me and start making a small talk with me, told me I looked beautiful (even though all girls usually think I’m a creep because of my looks and demeanor). This girl was a solid 7/10—attractive and four years younger than me. After some small talk, she gave me her number. In that moment, my entire childhood flashed before my eyes. What would be the point? If I had a child with her, how would I feed or provide for him? And if we ended up married, how could I afford to rent a home with my meager side hustles? Hell How cloud I give her a gift of I barely pay for my own food!  
  
So, I never called her. I think I’ve associated money with happiness and not being a lonely, miserable person due to my childhood. I place the blame squarely on the shoulders of that single piece of garbage I’ve never met, “G.”  
What’s stopping me from committing suicide isn't the feel of hope, it's the uncertainty of what happens after death. But if reincarnation is real, I will do what ever it takes to find that bastard and torture him to death, then kill myself to find him in the next life.

If there’s a heaven and hell, I’ll do my best to make it to hell just to ensure I can torment him there.

Anyway, I just finished this book, a study for obedience, and im confused. Like really confused. Like, i enjoyed the book (i think) but, and this is coming from a grade 12 student so take this with a grain of salt, the actually writing, like the grammar, structure, flow, etc, were terrible. Super clunky sentences, I was FREQUENTLY (as in every few lines) counting sentences with 5 plus commas and wayyy too many words per comma. It felt like the author really wanted to be all mysterious, which is fine, but everything is bad in excess and it feels like a good 70% (and this is not an exaggerated figure) of the book I could not easily understand. And I dont mean like “oh i had to do an in depth analysis on a few sentances”. No, I mean like every few sentences and sometimes every other sentence the author shoved as many metaphors, symbols, overly complicated words that didnt add to the story or sentence, commas, sometimes bad grammar (I think), and more.

This all combined to make even attempting to read this a challenge for me. To add on, not only was the grammatical structure seemingly bad for me, the stories structure was weird too. For the most part it was alright, but too often was a given point in the story riddled with side tangents and flashbacks. I understand that is an intrinsic part of the main characters Personality but coupled with the grammar discussed above and I had even more trouble reading. To give you a very-generous example of what issues were like, sentences like this were painfully frequent:

 “my dog, despite it being well taken care of and looked after frequently, something I did not have the luxury of receiving frequently as a child, instead often being met with a sort of fearful distance from all those around me, perhaps due to my quiet nature, often preferring to stay inside myself rather then dare to venture outwards. I mean, it’s safer to simply observe and learn what others want, to live in complete servitude of others. Was often hungry, always looking at the food I was given.” 


Now I dont know if I expressed what I was reading correctly in the paragraph I threw up. But the writer kept doing what I did above, having the main point (we’ll call A) in a sentence and having every letter in the alphabet in between A and the conclusion of the main point (B). Couple that with metaphors and symbols which are 100% used in excess. An amount I could never hope to replicate in the paragraph above, so I just opted to omit them. And words which I didnt even know existed. Like I like to think I have a decent vocabulary, more intuitive then anything, but these words the author threw around, again, in excess, made it impossible for me to read. 

I did actually finish the book just now and, side note, it’s 6 am and im on my 2nd cup of coffee so forgive any grammar mistakes I make in this post. 


For anyone thats read the book, PLEASE help me understand what I read. I know the book has ties to antisemitism but from what I see other people online saying the ties to antisemitism are wayy more then I was able to pick up on. I understand most of it is implicitly stated with how the townsfolk treat the MC but for me, in the context of the story, the main thing the author was trying to showcase with the dislike for the MC was her personality, her beliefs. What she thought and how it affected others. And how her thought process could be completely wrong. How her personality wasnt a deterrent and it was simply her imagination. This part of the story I liked. It was really interesting. I like how for a VERY brief period, the MC seemed to be recovering from what I’ll call her “ego death”. The death of her sense of self which occurred early into childhood it seems. She seemed to have faced a realization (one which for the reasons previously mentioned I could not fully interpret), which put her in a mindset of “maybe the silence when I walk into a cafe existed before me”. Only then to be shattered when she found this wasn’t the truth (it was cause she’s jewish right?). She then regrets ever tryna be “open” and comes to the conclusion she can only exist “closed” from everyone, away, outside looking in. I did like this part, her personality and beliefs were very fun to see and I was able to understand I think around 70% of her. Again for the rest of the story, 🤷‍♂️. 

Some of the things I didnt understand off the top of my head

- she mentioned for a period of time in her life she wanted to help ppl, I didnt understand if she was like a suicide hotline type person or something?

- that bit about the 14 year old on a hospital bed right after, which is then followed by her hating on men. Felt like I missed a page. Did these men, or this one guy she was describing, do something to this 14 year old. Was it simply a like imagination thing she made us see for the sake of explaining her mind at the time?

- wtf happened to the brother. He got sick, then the sister basically took over his life in a really creepy way. Surprisingly it was creepy enough to give me a bit of that horror thrill though it was unintended I believe. Something about how she pretend to be obedient in my mind but this is exactly how she wants to live her life. A perfect schedule around someone else. Getting to talk to and interact with the dog. Putting all her energy in someone who doesnt speak back. Part of me thinks she poisoned him??

- whatttt was that church scene. The little pig heads??? Like okay. So she is on a walk for wtv reason, reaches the top of a hill (?) if I remember. Is then approached by 2 ppl from the town wearing white. For some reason, unless I missed a page of a paragraph, she starts leading THEM to the church as if they’re lost???  Like how did she know where they wanted to go no words were or could be exchanged. And then even though shes leading them it feels like the author meant to say they led her? Then she is presented with her little straw men she made (ik its not straw but oh well) and other things of significance like the sows dead children, why??? The ewes dead lamb too for some reason. It felt like a dream segment. 

- she briefly mentioned a ruined carved above their door. Never brought up again

- wtf was up with the women and her dog? So our MC decides the best course of action is to just lie and agree with the women that her dog was impregnated by the castrated bert, this makes sense with our MC’s personality and thoughts at the time but why did this make the women and dog stop talking. Completely ignoring our MC’s presence. Our MC who then goes on feeling bad that she destroyed this womens world view, or infringed upon it, or something like that?? How?? It doesnt make sense i genuinely think I read it wrong


Anyway yea confusing book. Needed to rant. I like talking about stuff I read, I did actually enjoy this all things aside. I really liked 2 things in particular. Early in the book the love she has for the village and its order from afar. I can only imagine it felt like Clash of Clans or any other similar simulation type of game. Being able to observe a town from afar. Maybe sims? Being but with less control. Knowing exactly when work starts, when it ends, feats, celebrations, etc. i also LOVED her thoughts on the church. I am in no ways religious but the perspective was so cool to me. People are associated with their failures all too often. It
Becomes a metonymy (my favourite new word picked up from the book) for that person. In church however, this is all expected and accepted and wanted. It is a place where the ground assumption is that your very first moments of existence are failure (sin) and this is a place to be cleansed of that failure. Thats why everyone is there. And therefor it is not a thing to be shamed
Of.

So, here’s the gist. Some of us—a lot of us, actually—are smart, well-read, and possibly even professionals who understand finance, tech, or both. We weren’t just throwing darts at the NFT board. We saw an opportunity: licensed NFL NFTs backed by DraftKings? It sounded solid. They had the players, the tech, and the marketing. It was the kind of thing that made you think, *“This could actually work.”* But guess what? It didn’t.

Now, we’re sitting here holding the digital equivalent of Beanie Babies from 1998, except at least Beanie Babies are still tangible. DraftKings? They’re off saying, “Oh, NFTs are volatile. The regulators are mean to us. We had to shut it all down. Sorry, not sorry.” And the best part? They knew this might happen. They *always* knew.

DraftKings had all the escape routes planned. “Broad termination rights.” “Force majeure.” Fancy legal phrases that essentially mean, “We’re outta here as soon as it looks bad for us.” And boy, did they bolt the second the regulators came knocking. But what about us? What about the people who bought into their big promises? Nope. No safety net for us. We just get an email that says, “Thanks for playing,” and maybe a handful of pennies if we’re lucky.

Meanwhile, let’s talk about the NFLPA and the players. Oh, they’re not losing sleep. They’ve got lawyers who charge $1,500 an hour, out there clawing for their $60 million. And you know what? They’ll probably get it. Because that’s how this works. The rich get paid, the lawyers get richer, and the rest of us are left with our digital collectible of *Backup Kicker #42* and a bunch of worthless promises.

Let’s not forget DraftKings’ performance art in court. They’re out here arguing, *“Oh, the Aug. 1 payment deadline wasn’t a real deadline, it was just ‘invoiceable.’”* What the hell is that? Imagine telling your landlord, “Don’t worry, the rent isn’t due, it’s just invoiceable!” See how fast you’re packing up your stuff.

And then there’s the classic corporate line: *“We shut down because of regulatory uncertainty.”* Sure, DraftKings. Sure. You shut down because you didn’t want to get dragged any deeper into lawsuits that might cost you real money. Gotta protect those quarterly earnings, right? Can’t have Wall Street getting spooked.

So, what’s next for us, the regular folks? Class action? Sure, but let’s be honest—by the time that wraps up, we’ll be lucky if we get a $5 DraftKings credit to use on some parlay that’ll also go sideways. Meanwhile, the NFLPA is sipping champagne, the lawyers are buying yachts, and we’re here Googling, “Can I deduct NFT losses on my taxes?”

But hey, at least we’re learning something. The next time someone pitches us the “next big thing,” we’ll know to ask, *“Does this come with broad termination rights?”* And if it does, we’ll walk. Or run. Or maybe just set fire to our wallets right then and there—it’ll save us some time.

So, to all my fellow Reignmakers survivors: chin up. Or don’t. It’s fine. Either way, we’ve got each other, our useless NFTs, and the faint hope that somewhere, somehow, DraftKings will actually be held accountable. Until then, let’s enjoy the dark comedy of it all. *Invoiceable.* Unbelievable.

**DraftKings** has yet to file its motion to dismiss the suit brought against it by the **NFLPA**, but in a recent court filing, the sportsbook operator behind the now-shuttered **Reignmaker** and **NFT Marketplace** offered its thoughts on the merits of the claim.

In a letter to Judge **Analisa Torres** of the **Southern New York District Court**, DraftKings noted its intent to file a motion to dismiss the suit. In the NFLPA’s claim, the labor union [said](https://sbcamericas.com/2024/08/27/draftkings-nflpa-lawsuit-details/) that DraftKings has no plans to pay any of the remaining $60 million or so the company owes them for the licensing rights of NFL players on DraftKings Reignmaker products.

# DraftKings says regulators and courts were questioning NFT product

While the NFLPA described the deal as a money grab and an attempt for DraftKings to capitalize on the NFT zeitgeist while it was at its peak, DraftKings claims in its letters that the company always understood the volatile nature of NFTS, which is why the agreement included “broad termination rights and other contract terms.”

The two parties are at odds over whether a judge denying DraftKings’s motion to dismiss in a class action lawsuit centered on whether or not its NFT marketplace qualifies as an unregulated security counts as a triggering event that allows for the cessation of the deal.

In its letter, DraftKings said that, in addition to the judge’s decision, the company also began receiving regulatory subpoenas as far back as July 2023.

“A growing number of other regulators and courts made or accepted claims that NFTs are securities,” the letter noted.

The operator also argued that the denial of the motion to dismiss forced their hand to shut down Reignmakers and NFT Marketplace, as continued sales ran the risk of resulting in a larger potential damage payment should they lose the suit.

“It was materially practicable for DraftKings to operate its NFT business in a way that would allow it to benefit from the rights granted under the agreement.”

# DraftKings and NFLPA remain at odds over contract enforceability

Finally, DraftKings takes exception with the notion they defaulted on a payment, as the Aug. 1, 2024 payment deadline was not when payment was due, rather the date the invoice became “invoiceable”. DraftKings informed NFLPA of its plans to terminate the deal on July 29.

It appears DraftKings is seeking a pre-motion conference with the judge on the issues raised in the letter before filing its motion to dismiss. Currently, fact discovery in the case is due on Feb. 14, 2025.",1,1733052651.0,reignmakerslawsuit,0,1.0,False

People who ship this seem to ignore all the Red flags and things Toffee did to Moon's family (Kill most of her family, including her mother) and they also ignore the age gap (most of the time). although we don't have a clear awnser on how old Toffee is, when Moon and Toffee first met in person during the war, he would have been around the age of I'd say 25-30 by the looks of it, while as Moon was only around 16-17. Even though the age gap isn't that much bigger, it's still a bad age gap. Moon was 16-17 which means in some countries / states would not be the legal age of consent yet people still draw questionable fan art and ship them. And not to mention, in the earlier stages of SvtfoE in an article Daron wrote about Toffee and Ludo's relationship (platonic) that released around the start of this year, she mentioned the fact Toffee had a Family and a kid (Highlighted in the inage above) A FUCKING KID!! and although it has not been confirmed to be in the official show, ITS STILL A PART WAY CANON. If it did end up staying in the show but it just hasn't been fully confirmed, then my guess is that Toffee would've had some kind of Romantic relationship going on During the time he was defeated by Moon, and that dosnt necessarily he had a kid during that time, but it is still a possibility he was already in a relationship. I think its just a very problematic ship in general when you look at it from the realistic side and not the ""Omg this ship is so cute!"" Side.

I'm not trying to force anyone to not like the ship I just think people need to understand how problematic it can be in some situations, canon or not. But yeah ship what you want but just try and consider things like age gaps and canon red flags when shipping anyone or anything.

Anyways that's pretty much all I have to say for now.

1h414u9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1h414u9/bye_november_hi_december/,"Bye, November, Hi, December!","Today we conclude *The Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life: SGI President Ikeda’s Lecture Series* in the [November issue](https://www.worldtribune.org/2024/many-in-body-but-one-in-mind/) of *Living Buddhism.*). The 8th and final section is entitled ”Soka Gakkai Buddha.”

Sensei begins:

>As long as the fundamental spirit of striving for kosen-rufu demonstrated by the first three presidents pulses vitally in our organization and everyone is united in the spirit of “many in body but one in mind,” the Soka Gakkai will forever possess the great life force of the Buddha who seeks to lead all people to enlightenment.

From my little perch I can't comment on “the Soka Gakkai will forever possess the great life force of the Buddha.” But yesterday we sure needed the great force of the Buddha to check out all of the Autumn Season clients and get the lots ready for the Winter clients who will start to arrive today.

At about 4:00 p.m. we must have looked like [The Band of Brothers](https://images.app.goo.gl/NWp6EhmYQT3nXP5C7)  at their lowest point. Bernie and Artie looked at each other, nodded, and told us, “Go, get away from here, have a nice dinner, we'll babysit the Twinettes and the Twinmen.” We actually were miraculously able to get reservations on a Saturday night at Laverne and Shirley's! It usually takes months to get one but they had some cancellations.

Sensei continues:

>This vibrant force shines with the great light of compassion that breaks through the darkness of people’s suffering and imparts courage and hope. It resounds with the lion’s roar that vanquishes injustice and steadfastly champions truth. And it inspires immense confidence in all people that they can transform their karma and realize happiness for both themselves and others.

This was reflected at their restaurant. Yes, it's the decor and the delicious food. But it is so much more than that. The restaurant and the B&B are run exclusively by Laverne, Shirley, Frida, Toni, and José. How can I describe it? I have to go back to the paragraph above because the restaurant checks all the boxes! In 2-3 hours, we felt like we had been on [The Magical Mystery Tour](https://youtu.be/AKWhOGfDfGA?si=ddzwTnjuB9AgWtdE). Even Benjamin Kdaké was as peaceful and calm as a freshly-baked blueberry muffin.

>Endowed with this power of the Buddha, the Soka Gakkai towers as a community of practitioners solidly united in purpose, a great and indestructible bastion of the shared commitment of mentor and disciple that will surmount even the fiercest onslaughts of “the three obstacles and four devils.” 

Since our district began holding meetings at the group level, we don't get to see Laverne and Shirley *et al* that often. After we ate they invited us into the sacred kitchen for coffee and dessert. They were still busy getting ready for the next seating but nothing much needed to be said. We just saw so much happiness, fulfillment, and dedication. Laughter? Frida and Toni were joking about José's modeling session that morning and he was as red as a beet. Enough said.

Sensei:

>Therefore, President Toda predicted that in the sutras of the future, the Soka Gakkai’s name would be recorded as “Soka Gakkai Buddha.” The unified gathering of the Soka Gakkai, directly connected to Nichiren and working to make kosen-rufu a reality, is itself a Buddha. This was my mentor’s unshakable conviction.

And we were right there, we felt, right inside the heart of Soka Gakkai Buddha.

>President Toda often said, “The Soka Gakkai organization is more precious than my own life.” I have sought to protect and nurture this harmonious community of practitioners, which is carrying out the Buddha’s will and decree, as if it were President Toda’s life itself. Making the unity of “many in body, one in mind” the organization’s guiding credo, I have done my very best to develop the Soka Gakkai and advance kosen-rufu.

>Let us continue exerting ourselves wholeheartedly in faith and taking sincere action to create unity in diversity—many in body but one in mind—and thereby further expand our harmonious community of practitioners, built by the first three presidents through the shared commitment of mentor and disciple. For this itself is the path of kosen-rufu and is a sure step toward world peace.

What a thrilling conclusion to the essay! We got home fully refreshed and everyone was sleeping, even Bernie and Artie. We weren't missed a bit, it seems.

Now, we are all up, coffee-ed, and gongyo-ed. The Wild Winter Warriors will start arriving from 7:00 a.m. We have a new strategy for them: this year we will be wilder and louder than any of them (even though we don't drink)! And Go, Bills, Go!

","First of all, as I said in the title of the post, this is my first pull from my newly bought coffee beans. The taste was good, and I liked it. I would like to hear your comments about it, so I'll provide some information about my setup. 


This is my espresso machine: Fakir Babila

And this is my grinder: DeLonghi KG 79

I have no knowledge about how good or bad they are. So, I would appreciate it if you could inform me about the quality of my espresso machine and coffee grinder. 


And here are my fundamental questions! Today, when I went to one of the famous local coffee roasteries, they asked what type of coffee beans I wanted. They said they currently have two lines of coffee beans, and I had no idea what they meant by 'two lines of coffee beans' out of the blue! Also, they said they have blended coffee beans and stuff. I just replied, ""Let's take it easy. The only thing that I'm knowledgeable about is that there are mainly two types of coffee beans: Robusta and Arabica. So, just give 250g of 50%-50% (Robusta - Arabica), medium-roasted beans"" 

I know Robusta contains more caffeine than Arabica, and Arabica contains more aroma than Robusta. Thus, I bought it and got out.



Long story short, what are coffee lines? Why are they from different locations such as Tanzania, Nicaragua, Araguaia, and Colombia? What's the difference between beans from different countries or locations? What is blended coffee beans?

I just don't know what to do anymore I can't take anymore of this and I'm really scared.

He wasn't always the best dad, he still beat me from time to time. Being an autistic kid wasn't fun at all, I just could never figure out how to do things right. My mom says that he was still violent even back then. One time being when I was around five my mom took me and my sibling out somewhere but he went crazy and destroyed thousands of dollars worth of my mom's wine collection. Another one which only I saw was when our puppy did something it wasn't supposed to and he threw it across the living room so hard that it shit all over itself and onto the the sticker book I was playing with.

Then when I was a preteen I had an unfortunate encounter with a guy from my school (he was arrested when he was 15 for something similar) and I didn't like when guys came into my personal space. But my dad took it as a challenge to him and he would corner me and grab me (nothing sexual) and it only made me more traumatized. He would only laugh at me while my ptsd kicked in. If I were to push him away it would only make him madder and he already hated me. To make matters worse he already has a history of ignoring consent. He would take photos of my mom sleeping if something was showing to use as revenge porn. 

Then when I was around 13 shit really hit the fan. My sibling came out as Trans. Jesus christ did that piss him off. The constant fighting made everyone depressed and then my sibling developed some sort of psychosis and started attacking me as well. Then one day my dad find a trans flag in their closet and that room turned into a WWE ring. I don't really remember the details I do remember some of the big things that happened. Mostly that he pushed them onto the bed and I was afraid he was going to hurt them. Then they jumped onto his back using the bed and started strangling him. So he turned around and slammed them into the closet door and they fell on the ground. So that whole time I was recording that shitshow while my mom called the cops. But my dad saw me recording him and chased me around the house until he was able to throw me to the ground and steal my phone and deleted the video. So since the cops were called there was a cps investigation. But when I said my sibling was crazy I meant it and they started making up fake shit about what happened and included my mom in it. My mom is a literal Saint on earth and so I had to deny the whole fucking thing and let that asshole wall free just because I couldn't watch my mom go with him.

So once he got off on all the charges he felt like he was on top of the fucking world and he became 1000 times worse. Like one day my sibling (who is a very talented artist) drew a cute little picture of a snail with a tiny skull as it's shell. But my dad freaked the fuck out and started yelling something about them being a sating worshipper and took the canvas. They then started yelling at eachother and I said something (I can't remember what but knowing me it was probably some stupid snarky comment because I was fourteen) and he flipped and started yelling at me. But luckily for me his giant ceramic coffee cup was next to him on the table and he took a shot at me instead. So he throws this giant ass cup at my head but thankfully missed because I was sitting down. Though let me tell you that I would have been deader than dead if that thing hit me. It left a giant hole in the thick plaster wall about 15 feet behind me.

Then there were other fights, I don't really remember what happened I just know they did. My memory just hasn't been good anymore but those were some of the big ones I remember. After all that he not only became worse as a family member but just as a person, he fell hard into the right wing rabbithole and if you want to know how far just take a look at German history. Ironic considered he married a JW but who am I to judge. It's the worst, he doesn't specifically target me but he is so hateful that he doesn't care who he hurts. For example he thinks civil right leaders are just ""bitching and moaning"", he thinks that women only are successful once they get on their knees (he knows i want to go to medical school) , he thinks gay people are groomers (real great think to tell to your bisexuality daughter) and other heinous shit. For an example of how much he ""loves"" our family he literally used to have a rifle positioned to aim at my mom's head while she slept and keeps other guns under his mattress. 

So know for what happened earlier. I was bored scrolling on the TV for documentaries to watch because I'm a boring history buff. I had already watched pretty much all of them so I settled on one I hadn't seen before. I figured since he was his phone that he didn't care but I was definitely fucking wrong on that part. I didn't think it would make him that mad because it was about old world slavery but then when I wasn't paying attention it started talking about slavery in the prison systems. That pissed him off so bad that when I got back from the bathroom he started yelling that all the people in the documentary are idiots (they are literally Harvard professors so like what?) and they didn't know what they were talking about. So he turned his head to me and started spouting shit about how he isn't allowed to shoot people and something about democrats or whatever and I said something wasn't true and he got so pissed that he walked over like a toddler and stole the TV remote from me. He kept trying to look up some nutjob and couldn't tell netflix from YouTube and he got all pissed off at me because it wasn't showing up. He finally figured it out after like 10 minutes and I was already playing on my phone.

Then a out 5 minutes after he figured out netflix is not YouTube he turned the TV off and said turned his smarmy faced grin towards me and said ""why do you hate all cops"" which I didn't say anything remotely like that the documentary just had a piece on people being killed by cops. I just ignored him and went about listening to music and playing my game. He stole my phone from my hands and said that ""I was brainwashed by liberal media"" because in his world cookie run kingdom and k-pop is considered liberal media. He wouldn't stop yelling at me so I grabbed my stuff and went to my room. I just barely put my stuff down when he followed me into my room and took my laptop and walked out of my room while still yelling at me. Then he came back and wouldn't stop yelling about whatever dumbass thought came out of his mouth. Then he finally laid off and fucked off then my dumb teenage brain said ""what a bitch"" outloud on accident (oopsie). Then he came back in and grabbed me by the neck and pushed me up against the wall as I fell over my cats litterbox. He then said I had a ""victim mentality"" and a ""victim brain"" which scared me because that's what people say to people who've come forward with rape accusations. So I started screaming for help and he finally let go of my neck.

I'm really scared I don't know what to do. All my stuff is packed, I've been hiding in the bathroom writing this with my old phone. I don't know where to go, I have money saved up but I have  never even had a job or a bank account so it's not much. I also don't know where to go, if I don't leave he is going to kill me. I also have animals that I know he'll kill once I leave but I don't know what to do. I have family I trust but they are really far and I don't even have their phone number and they could afford to look after someone but it would change their life a lot. I also haven't told my mom what happened I'm too scared that I'll get in trouble if I tell her. I just want to quietly leave on my own and start my life.

I'm sorry if this is too long I just needed to get this off my chest and tell anybody who will listen. This is also one of my first reddit posts so I'm sorry for any mistakes I'm just really lost and scared.",2,1733051098.0,domesticviolence,2,1.0,False

Neel couldn’t sleep. The skeletal woman’s twisted form and the baby’s chilling cries haunted him relentlessly. Every time he closed his eyes, he was back in that washroom, staring into the abyss. He knew he couldn’t face this alone, so the next morning, he rushed to Abhi’s house, desperate for answers.

Abhi’s Warning

Abhi opened the door, his usual carefree expression replaced by a guarded look. “Neel, what’s going on? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“I saw something at the coffee shop,” Neel blurted out. “In the washroom. A woman, skeletal, terrifying. And a baby crying. Then… you pulled me out. You saved me.”

Abhi’s face darkened, and for a moment, Neel saw a flicker of fear in his friend’s eyes. “You shouldn’t have gone there,” Abhi said quietly.

Neel stepped closer. “You knew something was wrong, didn’t you? You knew I’d see him.”

Abhi sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “There are things in this town, Neel—things better left alone. That man you saw… he’s dangerous. And now that you’ve seen him, he knows you’re involved.”

“Who is he?” Neel demanded.

Abhi hesitated, then shook his head. “It’s better if you don’t know. Trust me on this. Stay home for the next two days. Don’t come to school, don’t go near the coffee shop. Just stay safe.”

Neel scowled. “And after that?”

Abhi’s expression softened. “After that, meet Aditya at school. He’s a senior, and he’ll keep an eye on you. But don’t tell him about what you saw. It’s safer if he doesn’t know.”

Reluctantly, Neel agreed, though his mind was racing with unanswered questions.

The Farewell Ceremony

Two days later, Neel returned to school, feeling more anxious than ever. At the gate, he met Aditya, a tall, serious-looking senior.

“You’re Neel, right?” Aditya said, extending a hand. “Abhi told me to watch out for you. Don’t worry, I’ve got your back.”

“Thanks,” Neel muttered, though he wasn’t sure how much help Aditya could be against whatever was happening.

That afternoon, the entire school gathered in the auditorium for the farewell ceremony of the retiring principal, Mr. Sen. The atmosphere was somber but celebratory. Mr. Sen stood on stage, addressing the students with warmth.

“After many wonderful years, it’s time for me to step down,” he said. “I’m proud to introduce your new principal, Mr. Karan Malhotra.”

The room erupted in applause, but Neel froze in his seat.

As Mr. Malhotra stepped onto the stage, Neel’s heart stopped.

It was him.

The man from the washroom.

Neel’s breath quickened, and his hands trembled. Mr. Malhotra’s eyes scanned the crowd, briefly locking onto Neel’s. His lips curled into a faint, knowing smile.

Aditya noticed Neel’s reaction and leaned closer. “You okay?”

Neel’s voice was barely a whisper. “That’s him.”

Aditya frowned. “Who?”

Neel swallowed hard. “The man I saw… the one Abhi warned me about.”

Aditya looked confused. “I thought Abhi just wanted me to keep an eye on you. What are you talking about?”

Before Neel could answer, Mr. Malhotra’s voice filled the room. It was smooth, authoritative, but with an undercurrent of something sinister.

“As your new principal, I look forward to working with each of you,” he said. “Together, we will make this school better than ever.”

Neel couldn’t shake the feeling that Mr. Malhotra’s words were meant for him alone. Whatever was happening, this was only the beginning. And Neel knew that his last day of normalcy had just ended.

1h40xw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1h40xw5/l_need_advice_regarding_second_generation/,l need advice regarding second generation relative of my family.,"Since l have lost my father, l am currently residing with my mother at her home(to help her with the cooking, cleaning and other stuffs). And l am about to start my second master degree in the town l am currently residing(working on the proposals, revising entry examination etc). So in the future, l will be here at least for 2-3 years.
We have an old male relative of my parents who visit our home,unannounced,every other day. When he visits, he does not want anyone to engage any other jobs,chores at home, or study. But just sit with him and listen his stories. He always wants him to be  served tea or coffee(even we are doing cleaning job in front of him). And l am a young female who is pursuing academic career and l have to spend most of my time with my research and studies...
When he pops up on the door of our garden, and if l do not welcome him(even if my mother does), it cause a problem or at least lead to a converstaion(which is quite unnecessary and time consuming for me).l was studying or taking a shower, or something else and l find it quite unnecessary to wait him or welcome him at the door since he visits every other day, l mean it is not a protocol or a big deal.
And he does not want us to leave home. When he pops up at the door and if we are not home, he picks up an offensive attitude and judge us since we left home(he never informs us before visiting). l feel quite uncomfortable if l take my mother to grab a coffee and start feeling guilty to leave home, without informing him...
And when we leave home, and if the weather is okay, he forces and opens our garden door(quite easy to open up from the outside) and sits there for hours till we get back home(which is quite rude for me, because sometimes we have to change 2-3 busses to arrive some places and we feel like we would like to have rest when we get home).
And we have relatively Middle size house with garden and have dozens of chores. When we start cleaning it takes 2-3 days to clean the whole house. During those cleaning times(every other two weeks), he pops up, waits till the dinner and when we do not prepare something for the dinner he gets dissapppointed.
Some weekends, espeacially during sundays he rings our doorbell around 9 am in the morning. He sits till 10 pm. And we have to spend our sundays with him ...When he is sitting the whole day(being unproductive), he calls and speaks with his daughters in law with the phone and tells them he is at our home. But none of the daughters or daughters in law warn him or say, oh it is too early to visit someone on sunday morning, is there something wrong etc...

Two days ago, something very disturbing happened again.ln the middle of our big cleaning and chores, dinner time came. And we just decided to eat Sandwich and drink some tea or something simple(we were extremely tired).He gets suprised that we could not prepare a good supper table.And he thought that we can not afford some groceries since we do not have money(we are not rich but we have enough money for groceries...) and opened our kitchen fridge to check out what we have(it was insanely rude for me and l lost all of my respect to this person at that point).
He has sons, daughters,dozens of grandchildren(none of them is working, studying or busy with their lifes), so he is not completely alone.
He always breaks my heart and try to discourage me when l open up about my dreams about academy and he tries to convince me that l should stay this town, be a housewife, be dependent to my father's income. He always spills the tea regarding her daughter's weddings and thinks that l will never be able to get married since l am old. He thinks that l will never be able to get a job, since l am fat.  l should adopt a child to take care of me when l am older(insanely selfish and disturbing way to approach the topic of adopting a child)...
l am on the edge of giving up my dreams about academy, giving up my life to comfort my family's relative and l feel extremely guilty to leave home but just waiting him to pops up and sit with him for hours...
l do not know what to do and how to proceed... l actually like this person(although l have lost some of my respect) and l do not want to hurt my mother's feeling as well since he is her relative(she also gets extremely bored and tired this time after this fridge incident)...

A [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JD041625) in *JGR Atmospheres* found that “the regional warming over some MENA sub-regions is three times faster than the global average….The summer **hotspot over the Arabian Peninsula** has already warmed by more than 2°C and can potentially warm to approximately 9°C under the high-emission scenario…” The MENA region is expected to reach the 2 °C, 3 °C, and other temperature milestones at least 20 years before most of the rest of the world. 

Experts say that [**polar ice is nearing its tipping point**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00768-1), according to a study from *npj Climate and Atmospheric Science*. They also claim that [“reversing” climate change to its pre-tipping point position](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-reversing-climate-quadruple-experts.html) would cost at least 4x as much as prevention—which humans don’t seem the least bit inclined to do as it is. If we’re not willing to act now, we probably won’t be willing to act later… The British Antarctic Survey [feels similarly](https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/polar-ice-sheets-decisive-contributors-to-uncertainty-in-climate-tipping-points/). 

Another [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01799-5) in *Communications Earth & Environment* determined that the polar ice sheets “are most decisive for tipping likelihoods and cascading effects” among the major tipping points studied—and that it is inevitable at 1.5 °C, which [we have already passed](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68110310). The future [looks different](https://archive.ph/I2tfI). 

>“we have not yet sufficiently grasped the non-linear dynamics of the climate system and its subsystems, neither through measurements, observations nor modelling efforts. Concerningly, the uncertainty ranges of the tipping points have been adjusted and re-assessed downward since earlier assessments…it has been suggested that the AMOC is over-stabilised in climate models. This therefore has further impacts on the stability of the rest of the Earth system and the influence of the AMOC on the tipping of other elements….The WAIS is the element leading to the largest percentage change in the mean number of elements tipped and components transitioned at 1.5 °C…” -excerpts from [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01799-5) 

At least one person [was killed by **flooding**](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-dead-thousands-displaced-southern-thailand.html) in southern Thailand, with a few thousand more displaced. [3 died from heavy snowfall](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-south-korea-dead-heavy-snowfall.html) in South Korea. An [analysis of a **350+ elephant dieoff** in Botswana](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/29/mystery-mass-die-off-deaths-elephants-toxic-water-botswana) in 2020 is now believed to be the result of **algal blooms**.

Spain’s Balearic Islands [saw a new **record wind speed**](https://x.com/AEMET_Esp/status/1861489622271893505) last week: 236 km/h (146mph). Another [large fish dieoff happened](https://news.mongabay.com/short-article/mass-fish-die-off-amazon-drought/) in a tributary to the Amazon River. And global wine [production hit 63-year lows](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241129-global-wine-output-to-hit-lowest-level-since-1961) due mostly to **Drought/floods**. As the global [coffee supply tightens](https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/1061790/arabica-coffee-prices-soar-to-multi-generational-high-1061790.html), prices rise.

Bolivia is experiencing a [**days-long queue to buy petrol**](https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-fuel-crisis-economy-arce-president-gas-b43cff9dcfebdca40d35aad6911f055f) as their fuel shortage worsens. Black market fuel suppliers are capitalizing on this ongoing crisis. In Cuba, [blackouts continue](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-blackout-nationwide-tourists-american-families-mobilize-rcna181244) nationwide. Zambia and Zimbabwe are [facing their **worst blackout** in years](https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/worst-power-outage-in-years-hits-southern-african-countries/nqpxbj4) as the Kariba Dam continues drying up. Zambia relies upon the Dam for more than 80% of its electricity—over 60% for Zimbabwe.

An upcoming [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749124018505?via%3Dihub#sec3) in *Environmental Pollution* found that PFAS and microplastics, when combined, may be more dangerous—at least for the tiny crustaceans tested in this study. The two factors can cause “**developmental failures, delayed sexual maturity** and reduced somatic {bodily} growth.”

“**Entshittification**” has topped a list for [the word of the year](https://gizmodo.com/enshittification-is-officially-the-biggest-word-of-the-year-2000530173), faster than expected. I guess “doomporn” will have to wait until next year. 

Northern India’s [**smog** problems continue](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-mounting-economic-india-killer-smog.html), with growing economic fallout. Burundi’s population experiencing malnutrition [is expected to double](https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/burundi-number-children-facing-malnutrition-doubles-one-four-country-battles-worsening-mpox-outbreak) within the next 6 months, and “Burundi’s growing **Mpox crisis** is likely to worsen the hunger situation…” Meanwhile, in the U.S., an estimated [**316M pounds of leftover food**](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-americans-million-pounds-food-thanksgiving.html) (143M kg) was thrown away after Thanksgiving. The UN estimates that **wasted food contributes to about 10% of global emissions** (namely CH4 through decomposition)...

A [study](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-air-pollution-linked-million-deaths.html) in *The Lancet* concluded that **air pollution is responsible for over 1.5M deaths per year**—including 450k from heart disease, and 220k from respiratory illnesses. “The five countries with the largest all-cause attributable deaths were China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria.” Meanwhile, [e-waste is growing](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-tide-worse-ai-threatens-health.html) to never before seen levels this decade.

More research into Long COVID suggests [**brain fog** may be related to lung disfunction](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/sluggish-gas-exchange-lungs-may-be-involved-long-covid-brain-fog). And a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312824004384?via%3Dihub) which was published on Friday says that the spike protein of COVID, which can last for years after initial infection, may cause some Long COVID symptoms at the “brain borders.” 

Some writers [are arguing](https://archive.ph/qqCw3) that a serious bird flu pandemic is coming, and that [**viral reassortment could happen**](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/27/nx-s1-5208964/heres-why-bird-flu-fears-are-intensifying), resulting in a more dangerous or transmissible strain. As for [mpox, it is still spreading](https://archive.ph/uKTYj) in East Africa—but the Africa CDC believes that cases will flatline in January.

Venezuela is still reeling from an explosion three weeks ago that **disabled natural gas access** to half the country. [Tensions, and prices, are growing](https://archive.ph/Urb9y) in the country, and repairs are said to need 4 months. South Africa is also [said to be hurtling](https://businesstech.co.za/news/energy/801871/south-africa-heading-for-a-cliff-warns-ramokgopa/) towards a natural gas shortage before the year is through.

Angola [saw its **largest protest**](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20241126-thousands-march-against-angola-govt-hunger) **in two years** when thousands gathered to protest the worsening hunger situation. Much of the developing world [is seeing **hunger used as a weapon**](https://internationalbanker.com/finance/global-conflicts-push-crisis-level-acute-food-insecurity-to-all-time-high/), a problem aggravated by & connected to climate change. It’s no secret that [conflict and hunger](https://internationalbanker.com/finance/global-conflicts-push-crisis-level-acute-food-insecurity-to-all-time-high/) are so closely linked. Meanwhile, [South Sudan is trying to keep a lid](https://archive.ph/snUb7) on its unrest and [Mozambique grapples](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/military-vehicle-mows-down-woman-maputo-mozambique-election-protests) with more **post-”election” protests**. 

——————————

[**Islamist rebels**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce313jn453zo), one of the many sides in Syria’s [complex](https://x.com/kunley_drukpa/status/1862881071773204640/photo/1) (~~un~~Civil War), [have entered Aleppo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly27r5p0yno) and seized part of the city. Over [200 people have been reported killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/syrian-insurgents-cut-damascus-aleppo-highway-amid-fresh-offensive)  and several settlements in the countryside are [held by the rebels](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/syrian-rebels-launch-surprise-attack-on-aleppo). Government reinforcements, and Russian weaponry, are said to be *en route* to “liberate” the embattled city. The rebels [also moved towards the city Hama](https://www.voanews.com/a/after-entering-aleppo-syrian-insurgents-advance-to-nearby-province-/7882716.html) (pop: 1M), **taking several villages with almost no resistance at all**. 

Sudan’s old security architecture is [being supplanted by various “**ethnic armies**”](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzv77qrnro) popping up in the absence of authority—and the results [are not pretty](https://www.atalayar.com/en/articulo/politics/sudan-war-on-the-brink-of-ethnic-violence/20241125161640207974.html).

-The **automobile industry may be nearing Collapse**, if [this doomy assessment](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1gyvfez/huge_problems_waiting_for_trumps_economy/lyu1ndx/) is accurate. What might the consequences look like?

1h40xet,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1h40xet/whats_your_anxietys_special_chair/,What’s Your Anxiety's “Special Chair”?,"I want to share a great movie scene that helped me see anxiety in a new light.

It’s from Disney’s *Inside Out 2*, featuring the character of Anxiety, and it really made me reflect on how I manage my own.

For context, *Inside Out 2* personifies emotions like Joy, Sadness, and Anxiety as characters who live inside a young girl named Riley, helping her navigate life. 

Near the end of the film Riley is having a panic attack and at first the other charachters try to fight Anxiety and stop her. But when they come closer they see anxiety herself has lost control and they just hug her and give her comforting words.

 They realize that Anxiety isn’t the enemy—it’s a part of Riley that needs care and compassion. Furthermore, by the end of the film they're shown to have made a special corner for Anxiety with a cozy massage chair,  tea and they've learned to help her focus on what they can control in the moment.

That scene made me think: how often do we fight or ignore our anxiety instead of treating it with kindness? It also made me wonder: what’s *my* “special chair” and how can I support and comfort my inner Anxiety on a more regular basis and not let it grow crazy?

For me, I guess sometimes it can be stepping outside for fresh air, making a cup of coffee, or having a quick chat with a coworker to feel grounded. but many times I feel like I dont have the time or legtimacy to take those kinds of breaks at work but then again trying to focus with anxiety in your head is so hard.

What about you? What comforts or routines help you your anxiety? I’d love to hear your thoughts on what helps you",2,1733050850.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

1h40w9a,https://i.redd.it/7lggnqfkx74e1.jpeg,This years Christmas cabbage,"I’ve always found the danish Christmas side dish “Rødkål” (literally ‘red cabbage’) too heavy a side dish for the otherwise fat danish Christmas meals. So the last couple of years I’ve made an alternative: sweet fermented red cabbage and it’s an absolute banger.

I modified a kimchi recipe by switching out the chilis and other spices, for traditional Christmas spices like cinnamon, cloves and cardamom and boiling the spices together with a lot of sugar and honey, into a sweet infusion before adding the starch (i’ve just used maize or potato starch). When the starch began to solidify, I added the juice of four organic oranges to bring down the PH, together with some shredded orange peel. Then let it cool off to room temperature. 

Meanwhile the red cabbage has been cut out and salted, as to bring out the cabbage juice. I gathered the brine into a bowl while rinsing the cabbage under the tap, in order to wash away most of the salt (otherwise you’ll end up with some very salty cabbage). 

Then, I added the cabbage to the jars and the brine to the starchy sauce, cut up some organic apples and added them to the jars too. Finally I poured the sauce over the cabbage, added a leaf of cabbage over the top and let it ferment under a piece of thin voven cloth or coffee filter - it’s very potent, so I avoid sealing it off in the beginning

It’s been a week and the sauce is still sweet, but the sourness and tanginess has begun to form. The cabbage is still crunchy and fresh and even a bit carbonated. I’ve cleaned the top of the jars and the cabbage leaves have been replaced by bags of water in order to hold it down, and the coffee filters have been replaced by lids. 

It already taste great, but hopefully the flavours will be all balanced out in due time for Christmas :) It’s become a family favorite and I’ve even had reports (and experienced) that it helps reduce the bloating from the fat and starchy danish Christmas meals. This year I’ve made around 7L from roughly two heads of red cabbage, so there’ll be enough for all! :)

TLDR: I can recommend sweet fermented red cabbage for Christmas!",9,1733050721.0,fermentation,2,1.0,False

When I saw the ad, I couldn’t believe it.

$500 a night to watch an empty office building.

It sounded perfect for someone like me—struggling to pay rent and not great at staying awake during the day. I applied immediately. The company, NightWatch Solutions, didn’t even ask for an interview. They emailed me within hours, asking if I could start that night.

Of course, I said yes.

The email was brief but clear:
	1.	Arrive at the office by 9 pm.
	2.	Lock the front door after you enter.
	3.	Stay in the security room unless absolutely necessary.
	4.	Don’t check the fourth floor under any circumstances.
	5.	Leave at 6 am.

Sounded simple enough.

When I arrived, the building looked ordinary. A plain, three-story office complex surrounded by an empty parking lot. Inside, the air felt colder than it should have, and the lights flickered slightly.

The security room was small but cozy—complete with monitors, a coffee maker, and a comfortable chair. I settled in, watching the live camera feeds of each floor. The first few hours were uneventful. Occasionally, I saw a cleaning crew on the second floor, but otherwise, the place was empty.

Around midnight, I heard it.

BANG.

The sound came from somewhere above me.

Remembering the rules, I checked the monitors but avoided the fourth-floor cameras. Nothing seemed out of place. The cleaning crew was gone, and the building was silent again.

BANG.

This time, it was louder, echoing through the vents. My curiosity got the better of me, and I flipped to the fourth-floor feed.

At first, the screen showed an empty hallway. Then, a shadow moved across the corner of the frame.

I froze.

The email had been clear—don’t check the fourth floor. But someone—or something—was up there.

I leaned closer, trying to see if the figure would reappear. Instead, the screen went black.

The other monitors followed.

Panicking, I grabbed the walkie-talkie left in the room. I wasn’t sure who I was supposed to call, but before I could press the button, static crackled from the device.

A voice, distorted and low, whispered: “Come upstairs.”

I slammed the walkie-talkie onto the desk and stared at the dark monitors. My phone buzzed in my pocket, making me jump.

The message was from a blocked number.

“You shouldn’t have looked.”

Shaking, I glanced toward the security room door, which was slightly ajar. I hadn’t left it like that.

The building was silent again, but something felt wrong. The cold air was heavier now, pressing against my skin.

Another message buzzed on my phone. This one included a photo of me in the security room, taken from just outside the door.

The message read: “You still have time to leave.”

I didn’t need to be told twice. I grabbed my bag, sprinted to the front door, and unlocked it as fast as I could.

As I stepped into the parking lot, I turned back toward the building.

On the fourth floor, a single window was lit. A figure stood there, watching me.

This story can continue with the protagonist being pulled deeper into the mystery of the building, possibly getting lured back by an even more lucrative offer or facing consequences for breaking the rules. Let me know if you’d like more!",10,1733050698.0,nosleep,1,0.92,False

I obviously wanted too much. Poor customer service to a laughable degree follows.,"Just venting and asking if anyone else has had this happen to them as it seemed a catastrophe at every level. Irrelevant now as it’s made me switch networks. Sit down, pour yourself a coffee.

I have had an unbroken direct debit to O2UK as my sole mobile service provider for over twenty years. I think 21. I’m not saying they owe me anything, just adding it for context. I’ve stayed with them because switching always hitherto seemed like a faff and I’m fairly careful, shall we say, with money and I’ve always found something with them that’s at least competitive and I’ve never ever needed to contact them about service.

Then last week happened. Jesus wept.

So, I am currently on a SIM only deal which was arranged direct with O2UK (as all my previous deals with them have been, no third parties as far back as I can recall), which I switched to from being on an iPhone 6S contract with them which ran its course some time around late 2019.

Due to annual price increases this SIM only was £8.70 for 25GB but still reasonably competitive. 

However, the current iPhone 8 (oxymoron) I have is on its last legs battery wise, and I needed/wanted a new device.

Not overly fussed on having the newest thing out there, but fancied more storage and never like the idea of a refurb so saw a nice deal on a new iPhone 13 via [mobilephonesdirect.co.uk](http://mobilephonesdirect.co.uk) (sound a bit fly-by-night, but are a subsidiary of AO for anyone who doesn’t know, just as I didn’t prior to last week!).

By the way, I’m not some sort of Apple apologist and have no other Apple products, but my car doesn’t support Android Auto so getting an iPhone is a given.

So I see Mobile Phones Direct are offering a Black Friday week deal on an O2UK iPhone 13 128Gb with 90Gb of data for £521 all-in (including CPI+3.9% increases annually) which as I write is no longer available and has increased by £100.  I couldn't get anywhere near beating this with the best deal on buying a iPhone 12 128Gb from Argos at £399 and using my SIM only deal so it’s the one to go for.

Now, being a bit of a clown and not quite understanding the mechanism that will allow it to happen as it is not a network switch, all I want to do is speak to O2UK about how I take my number from my O2UK SIM only contract direct with them to a third party sourced O2UK contract with a device.

And that’s where an absolute bin fire of the worst customer service, contradictory advice, wrong advice, promised callbacks which never happened, incompetence, general idiocy, confusion and general sense of wading through treacle over three days commenced.  I should add this is all through speaking to people in a non-UK call centre, which is fairly typical these days and not normally an issue, but I did feel there was a lack of understanding about the UK network set-up which didn’t help things. 

First person I spoke to on Monday said I needed a PAC code even though I stressed it was O2UK -> O2UK.

Sounded wrong so I rang back later for a second opinion.  Took it as a simple misunderstanding which would be sorted by speaking to someone else.

That person said the previous person was wrong and that I did not need a PAC code, but it was something that the third party would need to sort out for me.

Rang mobilephonesdirect and they said it was not their issue and that O2UK, as the network, would need to sort it. Which is what I expected.

Rang O2UK again. Person seemed unable to grasp that it was the same network. Was also obsessed with calling the offer at mobilephonesdirect an upgrade regardless of how many times I told him it was not and I then had to explain the technical difference as to why it was not one.

He then told me he would find an offer to match from within O2UK. Fine. Just match it as it is price-sensitive… Comes back with a 3 year “deal” which was £1,600 on the nose. i.e. double the annual price and I’m locked in at that for 50% longer. Genuinely seemed offended when I told him that was a joke after being on hold for 10 minutes. I pointed out how it was greater than twice as expensive, there then followed an uncomfortable pause which he ended by saying “so would you like to go ahead with this offer?”.

No.

He then suggested that as my SIM only deal was a 12 month contract (ending in January) I would need to pay the early termination fee. £8.70 a month, how bad can it be. Yep, go ahead. I then ask what door doing that actually opens though – I still need to know what I need to do to take my current number to the new O2UK contract. “You cannot, sir”.  Sorry, what am I paying an early termination fee for if I still can’t do what I’m trying to achieve; what you just suggested?!

Takes a minute and then revises his patter and says I can do it after all.

On hold for 10 minutes.

Comes back to tell me he cannot tell me the early termination fee unless I commit to terminating it. I said that for all I know there might be some clause where they add a £100 admin fee or something, so there’s no way I’m terminating it without a concrete assurance of what it will be and that it’s ludicrous.

Plus I still hadn’t been furnished with what would happen to sort it anyway.

And while I was on hold and he was looking into it, he must have triggered something that fired off a text to me that said in no uncertain terms the termination fee was £0.00.

When he told me he couldn’t tell me, I mentioned the text and he said to ignore that as it only applied if I was leaving O2UK for another network and that if I was staying with O2UK there would be one. Because that obviously makes sense. 

He didn't grasp anything and was I tired of going round in circles over three calls and 2 hours of aggregated time to idiots all contradicting one another with equally poor advice/info. Asked to raise to a complaint. Was told that I could not speak to a supervisor or a complaint handler right now but was assured someone would call me - categorically - within 24 hours.

26.5 hours later I had heard nothing so rang back.

Told this person how I'd been told someone would call me and after the misery of Monday, that was not a good result. He assured me he would either find a matching deal to the one I've seen at mobilephonesdirect or give me the absolute information on how to sort. Like a cop negotiating with the DA in a 70s film, he just needed 24 hours.

Given I had laid it on the line with him as to how saying I'll get a call back and then not delivering one was the cardinal sin, he gave me his word than even if he had no news or bad news he would definitely ring me rather than leave me hanging. I asked him what time he was working the next day and to leave a message if I could not pick up - which he assured me he would and told me that he started at 11am...

By 5pm I had heard nothing 

Quelle surprise.

Fifth person in the line of halfwits was the first person of the day on Wednesday. He confidently laughed at all the other advice I had been given subsequent to the first lady on Monday and categorically assured me this first person was correct and I needed a PAC code after all. 

Now, let me be absolutely clear, this chap knew beyond all doubt that my situation was O2UK -> O2UK. I reinforced it by telling him once again it was not a network switch and received wisdom, not to mention the third party themselves told me this would not be the case.

Told me the PAC code would be what I needed and issued me with it.

Rang mobilephonesdirect who told me categorically - as I thought - that a PAC code could only be used when switching networks. So yet again, moronic, incorrect, contradictory information.

Especially irritating as I had that phone in the basket on their website and very nearly bought it and signed up to a contract I would apparently not have been able to switch my number to, such was in infectious confidence. He was incredulous ""that this advice is not given to people"" and was going to issue a complaint on my behalf about all the people I’d spoken to who said this was incorrect and labelled them ""incompetent"".

Luckily I had that element of doubt, based on the fact that it's pretty clear no-one there has the first idea of what is going on, that led me to question it.

I spoke to a few other people on the Wednesday evening on the way to clocking up over 5 hours + and 8 people, and the last one was a woman on the retentions team who told me I would need to take an extra line on my current account. I asked her for explicit instructions as to how this would work and she assured me it would all become clear once I set it up. That wasn't good enough - if it was going to work, she should be able to tell me exactly how and what I'd need to do. 

Once again, she could not (as it was no doubt a half-baked idea) and assured me it ""should"" work. I said ""should"" isn't good enough. I wasn't going to enter into a contract on a maybe. I wanted something in writing from her rather than having to come back to O2UK with my only evidence that I'd done what someone there had told me to (when it didn't work) being my telling of a fairy tale. So I asked for an email summarising her advice. She said she couldn't do that, but would send me a text that would only come through once I hung up and the call ended. Call ended. No text.

5+ hours, 8 people, myriad instance of poor advice, 2 failed callbacks and still no result.

They actually make it easier to leave the network and go to a new one than try to keep an O2UK number between two O2UK plans. Absolute idiocy. 

I’m not convinced any network will be any better in this regard, but I just need to leave.

I’m not pretending they’ll miss my business or even notice I’m gone. I pay next to nothing and have no leverage and am now just pleased to be leaving. 

And I never got my next day callbacks and they are now six and five days old respectively. I think I might give up on them happening 🤣 

Painful.

I just hope if someone else is having or has had something similar, they will feel less like it was their fault!

I also enjoy playing traditional card games and board games. I like football and I’m 420 friendly. I also am interested in religion and spirituality and I like watching and listening to things about those topics too. 

I’m looking for a friend to get coffee with, hang out with, have movie nights or game nights with, and maybe have some late night smoke sesh philosophical conversations with.

I don’t know how to handle this spawn of a satan anymore, so if anyone has advice, please help me out!

First off, we only have one key to the room (we can’t duplicate it), and she keeps it to herself. If I step out for like two minutes to refill my water bottle and leave something wedged in the door, she’ll purposely close it, so I have to knock and wait for her to open it. Like, does that make her feel superior or something??

And don’t even get me started on how messy she is. The bathroom is gross—there’s hair everywhere on the floor and in the shower area. I’ve told her nicely A MILLION TIMES to clean up after herself, but she just doesn’t care. I’m kind of a neat freak, so I always clean up after myself, but it’s like I’m the only one making any effort. Oh, AND she somehow finishes a whole roll of toilet paper in ONE DAY. I don’t even want to think about how.

The kitchen is the same story—hair on the floor, stuff everywhere, and she leaves the shoe area by the entrance a total mess with socks and shoes scattered around. It’s disgusting to come home to after a long day.

We were okay in the beginning, but after a fight, we just stopped talking. She said I “talk too much” or ask too many “personal questions” (literally just normal friend stuff), so I apologized and stopped. But she refused to take any responsibility for her own behavior. Now she keeps using my stuff without asking—sticky notes, scissors, laundry detergent, even my coffee mixer. I don’t use her things anymore, and I never did use anything of hers except her kettle (I bought my own), so it feels unfair.

On top of all that, she talks to her boyfriend on speakerphone in the middle of the night, and I can hear EVERYTHING*.* I’m also feel like that she goes through my stuff when I’m not there because I’ve noticed weird greasy fingerprints on some things, and I’m like… bro what??

I’m stuck with her for the next 7-8 months, and I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’ve talked to her, apologized for my part, and backed off, but she just doesn’t care about anything like she has a HUGE ego(she never apologised about her mistakes nor has she even stopped repeating them smh).

Any advice on how to survive this? I’m reaching my limit.😭",1,1733049631.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False
1h40mq9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h40mq9,First day thoughts,"I was very excited about this calendar. And the first day promised a lot with Panamanian geisha. The brew was precisely as prescribed by KaffeBox for this coffee (incl. the water temp).

The aroma was floral with some jasmine notes (apparently what is described as “white flower”) but I would expect a bit more of it. Not so much lavender. The taste clearly has some sweet citrus (apparently what is described as “lemon tart”). Overall the cup was on the light side (something one would expect from geisha) despite the 1:15 ratio. The taste was pleasant and enjoyable.

However, I believe the potential of the coffee wasn’t at its best. The beans are in a not-so-air-tight cardboard canister. Considering the beans arrived several weeks ago and were roasted some time before that, the beans are at least a month old after roasting so past the peak freshness. And the not too exciting bloom confirms that.

At the same time, the beans themselves were very uneven in size. I’m by no means an expert but I assume beans of different size require different roasting time. And the color difference between small and large beans shows that the smaller beans are rated more. Again, it’s, probably, not an issue and coffee needs to be considered as a whole, but it was unusual to see this unevenness.

So, the coffee, if not constantly thinking that it’s Panamanian geisha, is enjoyable in general. But, in my personal, very amateur opinion, could be much better after more even and fresher roast.",2,1733049534.0,KaffeBox,4,0.75,False

Hi everyone, 


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc. 


As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.  


In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me). 


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂
