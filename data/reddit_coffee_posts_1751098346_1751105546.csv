1lmja6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lmja6a/aitah_for_blowing_up_at_my_girlfriend_after_she/,AITAH for blowing up at my girlfriend after she ignored me during a panic episode while hanging out with friends?,"I'm a 19M and my girlfriend (20F) and I have been dating for a little over 8 months. We live in dorms that are super close to each other  like, 2-minute walk. She recently finished her semester exams, but mine were still ongoing and I was stressed and sleep-deprived. That day, I had been studying with my friends all evening and planned to continue till midnight, but around 10PM I started feeling awfully exhausted. I’d had 2 cans of Monster and a cup of black coffee and hadn’t slept the night before, so I was getting palpitations.

I called her and said I’d be coming back early, around 10:30 PM, and asked if we could hang out for a bit and she said sure. I thought just seeing her would help calm me down. But when I texted her after getting to my room, she told me she suddenly had movie plans with her friends. I told her no worries, finish the movie and come by later. I was tired but waited anyway.

By midnight, I was feeling worse and texted her asking when she’d come. No response. I called. Ghosted. I was sweating and my heart was pounding, I felt like something was seriously wrong. Finally she messaged ""coming in some time"" and ignored every other message. I waited. Nothing. I couldn’t sleep so I kept tossing around in bed hoping she'd come, still thinking ""maybe she’s just about to.""

Around 1:30AM I went for a walk to try and calm down and bumped into one of her friends who was buying a drink from the vending machine. I asked if my gf was with them and she said yeah, they were all just playing cards. I asked her if she could tell my gf to call me back, and she said she would. She didn’t. Not a single message or call.

I ended up calling one of my other friend, then eventually my mom at 3AM, trying to calm myself down. I genuinely felt like I was going to pass out. At 4AM I called her again — this time she picked up. I asked her to come meet me. When she did, I was physically shaking and I just broke down crying. I told her everything — how I felt, how scared I was and she barely acknowledged it. She said “sorry for not being there” but then followed it with excuses like ""I didn’t see your texts,"" and ""I only played cards for 10 minutes, and after that I was tired so I just slept there,"" and ""I deserve to have fun, my exams are over.""

That last part really stung. I understand needing time off but it felt like she completely disregarded what I was going through. I wasn’t asking her to stay up all night. I just needed her for 15 minutes. I’m seriously considering ending the relationship over this because I feel so unseen and hurt. But I also wonder if I overreacted. I did blow up over text at one point when I was feeling helpless.

So... AITAH for blowing up and wanting to break up with her over this?",1,1751105228.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1lmj9wo,https://www.reddit.com/r/fightclub/comments/1lmj9wo/just_one_movie_or_more/,Just one movie or more?,"I recently saw the movie for the first time and I'm still torn. All I know is that I want to see it again. Either it's a solid movie that suffers from blunt consumption and social criticism and has unnecessary scenes for the plot or. Yes or this is an absolute masterpiece that has enormous depth.
At this point there is lidel in between for me

I didn't know the plot twist specifically, but I smelled it strongly. Not because I was paying so much attention, but because fight club was apparently so successful that other series have already adapted concepts. I don't want to spoil the show Mr robot..... but the first season has MASSIVE parallels to the movie. Maybe the consumer criticism just seems different to me because when fight club came out it was one of the first movies to do that? But I find the scene where tylor says ""you're your money in the bank..."" etc not epic or anything but rather cringeworthy. It sounds roughly like something a 14 year old posts in his instragram story. Especially for a movie that is so beautifully subtle with the whole plot twist, it seems out of touch.

At the same time, you can read a lot into the movie. Is he trying to say something about masculinity? 
Is Friedrich Nietzsche referenced here and is Tyler Durden perhaps the superman who now overcomes the narrator who represents the last man? 
Am I totally crazy or can parts of the unabomber manifesto be applied to the film that the narrator is so oversocialized that he has to invent a second personality to express his true needs? Where would tylor's mini monologue after the car accident about a more primitive lifestyle fit in? 
Why do some things about the movie come across as gay to me?

Why is it obvious that the narrator is even more unreliable than just tylor's invention?  Am I crazy or are there good reasons that marla is not real?

There's also some mini symbolism that I can't even attribute, like the excessive coffee consumption. Although the narrator doesn't drink any(!) Or that marla and tylor seem to smoke all the time and why soap?!

I recently talked to a colleague about the movie who likes it VERY much, but he thinks it's just a movie.

But I think ""just"" as a movie it's a bit more mediocre. Do others see it the same way? Am I totally over-interpreting something or is fight club also an absolute massacre of interpretation for you? :D",1,1751105198.0,fightclub,0,1.0,False

Sick to death of plots you can easily follow and cool, interesting characters? Bored of heightened drama, high stakes and action? Try [null](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217297039-null), the 725,083rd best-selling book on Amazon!

Follow three nameless, entirely undescribed characters as they mope their way through a cyberpunk dystopia while grappling with nothing more than their personal demons and the nature of reality. This PKDian, Borgesian, Serial Experiments Lainian novel is packed full of so many oblique cultural references and jokes even the author has forgotten what most of them are!

Here's what some internet denizens who were \[mostly\] bribed with free copies had to say about it:

    This book is not for you if you want a coherent and face-value plot with trendy story beats; a named cast; or a novel that runs on a trivially comprehensible path from inciting events to thematic conclusions.
    
    Instead, approach this as a book of IRC-punk poetry. Of nightmares both dreamt and half-forgotten in the time it takes to drink the morning coffee you know you shouldn't drink. Of faceless dialogues between strangers who are apathetically unaware of eachother's agenda. Of events that happen, but when?

    Think new wave jazz fusion. You know the instruments but don't understand the sounds or melody's, but slowly you feel your foot tap, and ear worms set in.
    
    This is not as others have said just a Shadowrun novel. Its a idea of what written language can do beside what you are use to reading.

    It touches on so many interesting themes from questions of perception to living in today's age where everything is merely a click away. Null can be both odd and something you recognize in daily life at the same time...
    I will be purchasing Null, I found myself going back a few times just to enjoy it from the start more than once on my first read and will probably be re-reading it many times in the future as well.

    PKD-esque cyberpunk multistory interwoven like IRC chat. Is one embedded in the other in the next in the first? I don't know! But, I liked it!

    Null is not a book that holds your hand. It's written with multiple different styles, from the view of multiple different characters, at multiple different times. There's IRC logs, blog posts, psuedo-interviews, etc. There are times where I was wondering how this all fits together, and to be honest I'm still not entirely sure. But I have my theories.

I packed as much of my stuff as I could in a checked bag, boarded an airplane, and haven’t looked back. 

To be honest, move out day was rough. I was a mess. At the time, I was convinced that this would be the biggest loss of my life. I keep thinking about how fun the first few months of our relationship was, and I wondered if we could get that back someday. He mostly played nice for the last day. We ended things on mutual-ish terms. He was sick of my “nagging” and lack of “gratefulness,” and I was sick of him breaking stuff when he gets angry and starting arguments at 2am. He helped me pack and gave me a lift to the airport. I worried that I was leaving behind a person that I cared about a lot. 

To my surprise, I boarded my flight and I felt calm. No more tears. Just a few hours of peace on the plane. My mom picked me up from the airport. I’m staying with her while I get back on my feet. I figured it’s a bit embarrassing to move back in with family, and I figured this would be hard. 

It’s been so lovely. My mom and I live together quite well. I forgot what it’s like to calmly discuss things like where to go to dinner or who pays for what. We clean up after ourselves and split shared chores, which is amazing after living with a narc who treated me like a sex doll that cleans and cooks. I’ve slept so well. I sleep in my own bed and no one wakes me up by groping me like he did. I thought I would hate this temporary period of living with family, but wow… I’m so calm and happy. The trees look greener. I found myself dancing to music. I slowly sip my morning coffee. I haven’t felt this joy in ages. 

I’m writing this because I was so ashamed to leave my ex and to move back home. I worried I was regressing at a time when I should be buying a house and getting married. I thought others would judge me or that I would miss my life with him. I don’t know how on earth I could have thought that. The feel in charge of my life. I’m surrounded by supportive and gentle people. I’m confident that I’ll be able to create the life I want, and it certainly won’t be with him. I never needed him. If you’re considering leaving but are worried about appearances or having less financial means, I urge you to take the plunge if you can. There’s so much joy on the other side.

Advice needed

I'm currently in the midst of one of the most painful adult friendship moments in my life, and I could do with some advice and outside perspective. I'm 32 (F), my friend is also 32 (F).

Some background, my dad (70M) is a very intense and quirky man. We suspect autistic/ adhd, but is from a time and background where these things weren't confirmed, and he's not bothered about it as an adult. He broke his back in an accident when i was 12, and dealt with debilitating pain until they burnt the nerves out in that area about 7 years ago. He is very lucky to be walking and has mellowed a lot in his old age, but my childhood was full of strange short term obsessions (ice cream making, fish keeping, cleaning gadgets etc.). He could be harsh, direct and I remember this meaning I wasn't particularly close with him as a child. He worked a lot, but always had a soft spot for my close friends, Sally, Lucy and Betty. He honestly is like a small kid around his favourite people (my friends, sometimes his sister, my boyfriend and my brothers wife), just becomes very chatty and interested in their lives, lots of silly jokes. I've always been worried it comes off as intense but Lucy always reassured me it's just how he is and it doesn't bother her. 

I have known Sally since kindergarten- over 25 years now and we grew up in the same small town where both our parents still live today.
We are moderately close as adults, we live in different cities but see each other independently of our larger friendship group of girls maybe once or twice a year. 

During Christmas holiday 2024, we meet this group of girls for a catch up. During which, Sally and I had a convo about how long it had been since we last saw one another, and she asked if I was free for coffee the next day. I asked whether she wanted to have coffee at my parents, and that they'd love to see her as it has been so long. She replied 'I can't be bothered to deal with your dad'.

I kind of shut down at this point, im not great in the moment with confrontation, but stayed for 10 more mins and then left and cried in my car. My dad is a sore spot for me, i am very concious of how he can be. 

She texted me an apology for making me sad, but really glossed over the actual comment. I accepted but asked for a bit of space, because really I do get it, my dad is a lot, I was just really hurt she would phrase it that way? I mean just say 'no I'd rather go to starbucks'.

It's something that was still bothering me 5 months later, I'd really withdrawn from the friendship so i talked it over with my therapist who encouraged me to reach out. 

I suggest a call to catch up but she says she's fine but very busy. A month later, I recieve a long text explaining that she is 'uncomfortable in our friendship and would like to talk about how things were left over Christmas with regards to my dad'. She continues that's she's noticed I've not been reaching out, and wants to know why.

I explain that what happened as Christmas cut deep, I'm not sure how I want to proceed especially given she never really explained why she was pretty rude. (Was she? I'm not even sure at this point and am worried I'm filling gaps with assumptions.)

Anyway, she leaves me on read for 2 weeks before sending me 15 separate voice notes (20mins + of speaking) explaining that:
She's never felt comfortable with my dad (exact phrasing is 'he makes me uncomfortable and always has') but no explanation of why or how 

She felt left alone with him when we hung out at my house as kids because she's shy and less outgoing
She felt that as one of his favs, she was unfairly forced to interact with him, and that as a child hadn't the confidence to explain this to anyone. 

That now she's an adult with autonomy and can control not seeing him, she's been reflecting and feels she's not been authentic in our friendship unless she tells me all this. 

She would make up excuses as a child to not come round to my house. 

At one point, she says that she knows I've had issues with him as a teenager / young adult (mostly overstepping opinions on what i should be doing with my life) so hasn't said anything before this point to allow me time to process (?)

She doesn't expect me to do anything, doesn't blame me and states that we are 'both victims'. Says she is laying a hard boundary that she doesn't want to be around him unless she has to. Point here that she hasn't seen him in years (i haven't lived at home for 10 years), which she acknowledges in one of the voice notes.

She also explains she's hurt I haven't reached out to check how she's been doing since our upset at Christmas, but states she's conscious i might not able to 'hold room for anyone else's feelings right now'. 

Please note, my dad worked very long hours when I was 4 - 11, then broke his back and was house bound for several years. Whilst yes, we did hang out at my house, I don't remember or feel we ever 'left her with him' (especially as I've always been v concious of how weird people can find him)  

Am I insane here or is this nuts? I listened to the first 3 messages at work (dumb) and broke down crying. I'm so hurt, and honestly baffled that she's felt the need to say these things to me? I accept that she doesn't like my dad but the way she's gone about this is honesty jarring.

She's also in the midst of training to be a mental health nurse, which adds a new layer of doubt for me? 

Am I wrong? Can anyone offer any perspectives. Is this a normal thing to bring up to your friends randomly? I honestly feel she could've just avoided him and I would never have noticed. I thought this group of friends knew me, my family and accepted us. It feels like parts of my childhood were a lie and I'm honestly heartbroken.

TLDR: friend of 25 years has expressed being uncomfortable with by dad for our whole friendship. Is this friendship ending? ",1,1751104964.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

1lmj5zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lmj5zu/killers_anonymous/,Killers Anonymous,"
When I found a post tucked away in the dark corners of the internet, my interest was piqued. It was titled: Killers Anonymous.

At first, I thought it was a joke made to scare or morbidly amuse people, but I was wrong.  It was a support group created for people like me. When I was about 18, I began to loathe life, and I couldn’t stand seeing my peers enjoying theirs. I would spend hours alone, but it grew into days of no contact. The drugs and alcohol I had been using started flooding my mind with unsavory things. I started fantasizing about death, and I imagined becoming the one who dishes it out. I would relish in thinning about the high I could achieve through such an act. A high that no drug could provide me. A high that I would never come down from. I knew it was wrong to think that way, but I couldn’t help but take pleasure from it.


After thoroughly reading the post, I was hesitant to apply. What if this were some new way for law enforcement to collect information on potentially dangerous people? I thought. I applied regardless, and after about a week, I finally received the confirmation email. The email contained almost all of the same information as the post. I scrolled down to the bottom, which contained their meeting schedule. “Hmm, next Friday?” I said. After I had passed the idea around in my head for several days, I decided to go. I was still nervous, but also excited. I was finally going to get the chance to speak about these urges, and not have someone shame me for them. At least I hoped I wouldn’t be. I had never told anyone about them before, but could you blame me? This isn’t exactly a problem everyone struggles with.


Friday came quickly, and as I stood outside the house I was told to meet at, anxiety began to build. Once again, what if all this was a setup? I thought. I swallowed my fears and made my way to the front door. I gave a few firm knocks, and a woman opened and greeted me. She was a cute brunette, and she looked to be in her late twenties.


“Oh hello, are you here for the group?” She said with a cheerfulness about her.


“Yes, yes I am,” I said as I reached out to shake her hand.


“Good to meet you,” she said while returning my gesture,” please come in and make yourself at home. We will be starting soon, but first, which group are you in?”


I paused and was confused by her question. “I thought it was just the one group?” I asked.


“Oh no, there are actually four groups,” she said, “one group wouldn’t be big enough. You would be surprised by how many people we get. Group 4 has fewer people if you would like to start with a smaller group.”


“I’ll be in group four then,” I said before walking inside.

Greeting me were two large living rooms to the right and left. Each room had chairs placed in a circular pattern. There was also a staircase leading into what looked like another large space.


“Your group is in the left room,” the woman explained, ”you made the right choice coming here, and I hope we can help.”


“Thank you,” I said before taking my seat.

After about thirty minutes of waiting, both of the bottom rooms now looked full of people. An older man in our circle, probably about sixty, stood from his chair and introduced himself.


“Hello everyone, my name is Troy Baker, and I’ll be mediating tonight. I would like to start by saying how proud I am that you’re all here tonight. I know all of you are probably nervous and hesitant, but I want you all to know you’re safe here. Now, I see that we have some new faces here tonight. Would anyone like to introduce themselves?” 


After a few seconds of silence, another man in the group broke the tension.

“I would,” he said, “My name is Mike.”


“Nice to meet you, Mike,” Troy responded, “Would you like to tell the group a bit about yourself and maybe why you’re here?”


“Umm sure,” Mike said with an unsure tone, “I was just a young boy when it started. It was small with just some thoughts, images, and fantasies. But after a few years, I started to experiment with dissecting animals. Mostly small ones like birds, rodents, and the occasional cat. Taking away the lives of animals brought a sense of comfort. I would strangle, stab, drown, electrocute, and then dismember them to finish. I felt in complete control, and my mind would become free and clear again. But the older I got, and the harder life got, I needed to do it more and more often.  Recently, it hasn’t been helping at all.


Mike went silent before Troy responded, “That was very brave of you son. Not a lot of people can open up about their thoughts and actions like that.”


Mike’s story fascinated me. I too had considered killing animals for pleasure, but I didn’t think it would provide enough satisfaction to satiate me. Besides, I actually liked and respected animals. It was people I had a vendetta against.


Troy turned his gaze towards me, “How about you son? Would you feel comfortable introducing yourself to the group?”


I nodded in agreement and told them about my disgust for people. About how I hated my own life, and explained my feelings towards how others enjoyed theirs. After I was done, I scanned the room. Everyone looked visibly uncomfortable with what I was saying. I took a deep breath before finishing, “but now I’m here, and looking for help.”


Troy stood again, “Thank you, Eli.” He said before giving me the same comforting message that he gave Mike.


After Troy sat back down, another woman raised her hand before saying she wanted to go next. She told the group about how she hated her parents and wanted to kill them. After she explained herself, she broke down in tears. Troy began to comfort her before calling the meeting to a close. After the group stood and exchanged pleasantries, I made my way over to Mike who was standing on the porch.


“Hey, it’s Mike right?” I said while tapping him on the shoulder.


“Yeah, What’s up?” He asked.


“I don’t have a whole lot of people who I can talk to about these sort of things, so I was wondering if you would like to get some lunch? I asked. 


“Umm, sure, why not?” He said with a sign of hesitation.


“Great! How does Jen’s Diner sound?” 


“Sounds good.” He said before giving a slight smile.


After a few-mile drive, I pulled into the diner parking lot. Mike pulled in right after. We walked inside and were approached by an attractive young waitress. 


“How many?” She asked.


“Two,” I answered, “and can we get a booth?”


“Sure can! Right this way.”


She guided us to our booth before asking, “So what can I start you two off with to drink?”


“I’ll take a water.” Said Mike.


“Sure thing, and you sir?” 


I looked deep into her eyes. She looked so sweet and innocent. “I’ll have the same,” I said with a smile.


“Okay, I’ll have those waters out to y’all shortly.” She said before walking off.


“So Eli, what made you want to join the… well…you know… the group?” Mike asked while seeming a bit fidgety.


“I guess I finally felt like it was time to get some help. Though, I don’t remember you ever saying what you wanted out of the group?” I asked.


“Well, I guess you could say I want help, but I also kinda don’t.” Mike said while looking down and avoiding eye contact.


“Same,” I said with a chuckle, “I want help, but I still really wanna try it at least once.”


His eyes looked up with a glimpse of curiosity curiosity in his eyes. “You know I was-“ Mike said before being cut off.


“Here are those waters,” said the waitress, “are y’all ready, or do you need a few more minutes?”


I looked at Mike and gestured to confirm before responding, “Yeah, we’re ready. I’ll take the club house sandwich and chips.”


“All righty, and what will you have?” She said while looking at Mike.


“I’ll have the working man’s burger with fries and no mayo please,” Mike said while looking more comfortable and open.


“Sure thing, I’ll be back with y’all’s orders as soon as it’s ready.” She said before once again, heading back to the kitchen.”


“Back to what I was saying,” Mike said after taking a sip of water, “I had an idea. What if just once, we follow through with our urges? You know… just to see if we truly have it in us or not.”


I felt it was a great idea before saying, “I don’t know, are you sure that’s something you want to do?”


“Yes,” he said with confidence, “I’ve been sure for a long time.”


When he said that, I could hear the seriousness in his tone.I reached out my hand to meet his. It felt like two partners agreeing on a business deal. After a few minutes went by, the waitress returned with our food.


“Here you are. One clubhouse sandwich with chips, and one working man’s burger with fries with no mayo. Enjoy!” 


We both thanked her before returning to our conversation. “So, do you have anyone in mind?” I said.


I saw him peer over my shoulder to the kitchen window. He looked like a hungry predator who had just caught sight of a plump hog. “How about her,” he said, “I think she would work.”


I turned to look back while having a good idea who he was referring to. It was at our gorgeous waitress. “Don’t you think she would be a bit risky? Especially, since she looks young and is probably known by a lot of customers? Wouldn’t people notice if she went missing?” I asked.


“Of course,” he said, “but there isn’t anyone going to suspect us. We’re nobodies to her with no connections.”


“Ok, we’ll do it,” I said hoping he was right.


A few more minutes went by, and we finished our meals. The waitress came and gave us our bills.


“Here you both are. Will you be needing anything else?” She asked.



“No,” Mike responded, “I think we’re good.”


As the waitress walked back to the kitchen, Mike was eyeballing her up and down. We made are way back to our vehicles. 


“Meet me here tomorrow, and we can start planning,” Mike said.


“Got it.” I agreed before shaking his hand once more.


I sat in my car while I watched Mike drive off in his truck. Soon after, I headed back home. I lived in a little apartment located in a more run-down part of town. It was all I could barely afford while working as a bookkeeper for a small local shop. Later that night while lying in bed and staring up at the ceiling, the feeling of losing control, which I was all too familiar with had returned to me. I thought long and hard trying to cling to the idea Mike and I had. I was hoping to be comforted by it, and it soon proved I was right. The next day, I met up with Mike at the diner at around seven o’clock in the evening just as we had planned. We had parked in the abandoned parking garage across the street to help get a better view. I got out of my car to hop into Mike older pick up truck.


“There she is,” Mike said while looking through a pair of binoculars, “hello gorgeous.”


“So what’s the plan here Mike?” I asked him.


“I think we should just follow her home to start. See if she lives with other people or not.” He responded.


After about two hours went by, the diner looked to be closing for the night. We sat a while longer and waited for the waitress to come out. About thirty minutes later, we saw her getting into her car. Mike started the engine, and we made our way to the garage exit. We followed her for what felt like thirty minutes out of town. She led us out into the country, which wasn’t a shock since we lived in a small rural town in Georgia. She pulled off onto a dirt road. We followed a bit longer before she pulled into what looked like a driveway. We crept up in front of her home with our headlights off. Mike pulled out his binoculars again.


“Should we just do it now?” I asked.


“No,” he answered sternly, “we don’t even know if she lives alone or not yet. Besides, I wanna take her back to my place. I live in a nice, quiet, and deserted place like this.”


“Your place?” I asked him.


“Yeah, my place. If I’m gonna do this, I want to do it right.” He said sounding like a tradesman talking about his craft.


“Okay,” I said not wanting to upset him.


He didn’t respond, and instead just kept watching her. She pulled out her keys, unlocked the front door, and went inside.


“Huh, she turned on the porch light. Maybe she is giving us the go-ahead to come on in.” Mike said while chuckling.


I laughed with him before he pressed on the gas pedal. After we hit paved road again, he asked me, “You wanna come over to my place? I’ll show you what I got prepped.”


Curious, I answered, “Sure, why not?”


“Great!” He said sounding excited, “I think you’ll love it, and I think it’ll help give you more confidence in our plan.”


He drove us back to his place, and he was right. It was in the middle of nowhere. A small mobile home on a piece of land that had a big barn In The back. We got out and walked around back to the barn.


“This is it,” he said sounding proud, “this is where we’re gonna do it.”


It looked old while littered with cobwebs and hay. The left wall when walking through the entrance, was covered in saws, hatchets, machetes, rakes, and even had a clever. It looked like a scene pulled right out of a slasher film. The right wall had metal rings, with what looked like chains and cuffs looped through them. They were lined up in a row leading all the way to the back, and it looked like a dungeon. Lastly, In the center was a large rectangular concrete slab, which looked to be about four feet high, seven feet in length, and another four feet in width. It too had metal loops drilled into it, and I could see leather straps lying on top.


“Wow, this is pretty impressive Mike. Are you sure you haven’t done this before?” I asked while laughing.


“No,” he said while grinning and laughing, “but I’ve been planning and thinking about it for years. I just haven’t had the gumption to finally commit to it, but now thanks to you, I do.”


“Well after getting a good look at this place, I think everything is gonna go great,” I said.


“Hey, do you wanna come in for a beer?” He asked.


“Sure, why not,” I said after checking my watch, “It’s only midnight. I’ll have one before we head back to my car”


We stepped back out through the large barn doors, and Mike locked them back before making our way to his mobile home. We walked inside with Mike leading the way, and I could hear Mike fumbling around while trying to find the light switch. Finally, the lights came on, and Mike went to the kitchen to fetch us a couple of beers.


“So do you live alone here, or do your folks live here too?” I asked.


“I got this place all to myself. My parents passed a few years back, and since I’m an only child, it all got left to me.” He said before handing me a beer. 


“What happened to them?” I asked hoping not to upset him.


“Died right in there,” Mike said while pointing to what looked like a master bedroom, “ I woke one day and found them still in bed. Cold to the touch and not moving. You know I buried them out back. Momma always hated the idea of being buried in a place full of strangers, so figured home would be more comfortable for her.”


“And what about your dad, is he buried here too?” I asked, very curious to know more.


“Technically,” Mike said before letting out a loud laugh, “as long as you consider being turn into pig shit being buried. Even that is probably too good for him.”


Not wanting to push the subject further, I kept silent and nodded. We continued talking for a bit longer while we finished our beers. As I stood up from his couch ready to head back, I started feeling nauseous and could barely hold my footing.


“Can’t handle one beer?” He said before I finally stumbled to the floor. 


“Ice water,” I said while trying to hold back vomit. Mike nodded before bringing me a glass. I poured some on my face, but it didn’t help. I was in and out of consciousness for many hours, but I do remember feeling rocks and sticks rubbing against my back like I was being dragged. Next, I could hear chains rattling, and soon after, metal cuffs clamped shut around my wrists. I felt the metal dig tightly into my skin. After that, I didn’t come to until a stinging beam of sunlight pierced my eye lids from a hole in the barn wall. I looked around still feeling the lingering effects from whatever was in my drink. It was hot and humid, and my clothes were drenched in sweat. My hands were numb from being in the cuffs for so long. Mike was nowhere in sight, and I couldn’t  hear much of anything outside. I tried wiggling the chains loose, but I had no luck. As the day went by, and the lingering effects went away, so did the sunlight. The sun was setting, and the barn was soon plunged into darkness. Headlights shot through cracks in the walls and lit up the barn. Soon after, I heard the sound of crunching pine straw coming towards the barn. The sound of the barn doors opening sent chills up my spine, I started hyperventilating, and my stomach turned from the thought of what he was gonna do to me.


“Breathe Eli,” said Mike after turning on the bright overhead lights, “I haven’t even started yet.”


“Wha… why are you doing this? I thought we were a team?” I said after catching my breath.


“No Eli. We weren’t a team. I do like you though, so I’m sorry I have to do this. If I had the strength to not give in to my temptations, I would.” He said in a dead monotone voice that I had yet heard from him.


“What are you going to do to me?” I asked while trying to control my breath.


“Eli, I’m gonna be honest with you. It’s not gonna be good for you. I have temptations and compulsions that go beyond just killing.” He said before filling a syringe. 


My stomach and chest burned with fear, and I feel my body wanting to convulse. He walked over to me before sticking me in the arm with the needle. I was begging him to stop, but he just told me to hush. It didn’t take long for the effects to take hold, and I was out like a light again. After I returned to what I assumed was going to be a brief time back in the land of the living, I found myself lying on the concrete slab. My legs, arms, torso, and neck had leather straps tethering me to it. After many hours of being restricted from using the restroom, I could smell my soiled clothes. I felt like an animal locked in a pen and ready for the slaughter. As I laid there marinating in my own waste, I could hear whistling approaching the barn. Once again, the loud noise from the barn doors opening filled the air.


“Good lord man, it smells like fucking piss and shit in here,” he said while chuckling, “perhaps I should have put you in some diapers.”


I didn’t say anything in response. I didn’t have anything left to say to Mike that wasn’t already said. He then grabbed the cleaver that was hanging on the wall before walking over to me. He rubbed my legs down with what smelled like alcohol. After he had wiped down my legs, he grabbed my left leg to hold it still, and then raised his right arm holding the cleaver. He looked like a butcher ready to get to work. His arm swung down in full force, and I heard the bones in my leg crunch. A sharp pain rang loud through my leg. With every swing, I hear crunch after crunch. I could hear my flesh tearing and my blood gushing out. I started to blacked out from the pain.


“No, no, no,” Mike yelled after splashing ice-cold water in my face, “we’re not done yet.”


I looked down at my body, and I could see my leg. It was sitting in a gray bucket that had been set between my legs. I threw up from the gruesome sight. Mike wiped my blood from his hands and face with a cloth before grabbing my right leg.


“Almost done Eli.” He said before hacking away again. I saw my blood splash across his face once more. The pain was too severe for me to stay conscious. The next thing I remember was ice-cold water soaking my face, and once again, bringing me back.


“All done for now,” he said while patting my face, “you sewed up real nice Eli.”


I looked back down to see that the bucket was gone, but so were both of my legs. I had stitches all over the nubs where my legs once were. Everything from just below my knees was gone.


“Come on let’s get you chained back up,” Mike said while undoing the arm straps.


“No needles this time?” I asked him sarcastically.


“Planning on running away?” He asked while returning the same sarcastic tone before letting out a sickening laugh. He then picked me up, and tossed me over his shoulder. As he was walking me back over to the chains, I saw that he had an old pocket knife tucked in his back pocket. I reached for it, and luckily my arms were just long enough. I managed to grab it and drive it into the back of Mike's neck. I fell and hit the ground hard after Mike dropped me. He stumbled for a second before finally hitting the ground as well. His clothes were soaked in blood, and I couldn’t tell how much was mine or his. Mike leaned up against the concrete slab before showing me his eyes, which were now filled with rage.


“Fuck you!” He yelled in between spitting up blood. Eventually, his words became nothing more than bloody gurgling, and then his body went limp. I crawled to the barn doors and was barely able to get one of them open. I managed to make it to the mobile home before finding my cellphone in his nightstand. I called the police and told them the address, which I found off a piece of mail sitting on the coffee table. I sat on the floor in his room until the police finally busted down the front door. Two officers rushed in and lifted me up before carrying me outside. Two paramedics met them, and they took care of me from there. The whole ride in the back of the ambulance, all I could think about was what would happen if Mike had some evidence of what we were planning together. After they got me to the hospital, they cleaned my wounds and redid the stitches. A few hours went by and an officer walked into my room.


“How are you doing son?” The officer asked.


“I could be better,” I said before letting out a grown from the pain.


“I’m sorry for asking. Anyway, I’m Detective Harrington,” he responded, “and I wanted to ask you about the man who did this while your memory is still fresh.”


I was reluctant, but I knew he was probably right. “Sure, what do you need to know?”


“Do you remember what happened when he abducted you?”


“It was while I was walking out to my car a few days ago.” I lied hoping he would buy it.


“And do you remember where this happened?” He asked.


“No,” I lied again, “I don’t remember much of what happened before waking up in the barn. He stuck me in the neck with something and I was out.”


“Okay, okay and did the perpetrator ever mention anything about his parents, or maybe a woman by the name of Emily Baker. Detective Harrington asked.


“He told me they died a few years back, but not much else, and I don’t know an Emily Baker. Who is she?” I asked.


He scratched his beard and finished writing in his notes before saying, “We think she was who he was targeting next. She’s just some waitress at a local diner, but you don’t need to worry about those details.”


“You sure?”


“I’m positive son. You just get some rest. We’ll we can continue after you get a little better” He said before stepping back out.


After a few days in the hospital, the doctors saw me fit to go home and I was wheeled out to my father’s car. He thanked the nurse for wheeling me out before he loaded me into his car. On the way home, he tried talking to me and asked me questions about what had happened, but I didn’t answer. I stared out the window not saying a word. After he figured out I wasn’t up for talking, we finished the ride in silence. When we pulled into the driveway, he helped me inside and laid me down in the guest bedroom. While lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling not blinking or uttering a word. I could feel pain in my legs that weren’t there. I hated the bastard for what he did to me. I felt betrayed by someone who I thought was becoming my friend. By someone just like me. I guess it’s for the best though.

1lmj4pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1lmj4pi/insensitive_husband_rant_baby_sleep_advice/,Insensitive Husband rant - Baby sleep advice?,"The last few days have been absolutely awful. It's 5 a.m. I'm writing this right now because I have given up on trying to sleep tonight. I'm just fed up with my husband's little to no support when I'm home from work.

As soon as I get home, I'm on baby duty. All the baby wants is to be held or constantly paid attention to by me and only me, which is hard when my husband won't cook dinner, do dishes, or do any other chores without being asked. And when I do, he always groans or sighs like I'm asking him to go above and beyond when, no, I want you to do the bare minimum for the household.

I knew he was a gamer; I'm also a gamer. But I haven't been able to play nearly any games since the baby was born, and I knew that was going to happen. I'm okay with that. But it's a slap in the face when all my husband does is sit on his computer and constantly play games whenever he's not working from 8 a.m. (sometimes 7-7:30 a.m.) until 10 p.m. every. day.

The few times I've asked him to spend time with us, like to do an activity or just to take some time to sit at the table and have coffee with me in the morning, he complains that he can't just ""sit around and do nothing."" And then goes on about how I just sit on my phone all day and that it's rotting my brain (which usually when he says this I'm literally breastfeeding our baby, so.. what else can I do while I have a whole 16lb baby in my arms??)

If I have the baby, I can't chop veggies, use the stove, or put anything in the oven. It's just not safe. And his crying stresses me out. I'm just fed up with it.

Lately, my son just wants to be latched onto me all night long. I tried very hard in the beginning not to cosleep but for a few weeks now, he's been sleeping very well in our bed. We don't use pillows and he lays in between our heads. I'm also a very light sleeper (can thank my mischievous cat for that) so literally any weird noise wakes me up. But I don't sleep while I'm feeding him, I've accidentally dozed off once or twice before and it scared the hell out of me when I woke up. So usually when I'm feeding him at night, I'm on my phone so I don't fall asleep.

By the way, usually I'm reading. I'm not sure why my husband thinks that reading on my phone is some huge big deal vs if I were reading a physical book 🤷

But last night, the baby would not go to sleep at all unless he was latched on. The past few nights I had been trying not to immediately offer him my breast and soothed him to sleep other ways and it did work. So, after me getting maybe an hour of sleep in between the hour that it usually takes for the baby to fall off his latch until 3am, the baby woke up. Like fully awake, was wanting to play. I finally just thought, you know what? Dad's turn.

So I told my husband exactly that, I have an 8am shift the next morning (usually I go in later so any other day of the week I'm not nearly as sensitive or cranky about sleep). I tried to fall back asleep, but my husband just layed there, holding one leg of the baby to make sure he didn't fall off the bed, but just let the baby crawl all over me and pull my hair. I even asked him nicely if he could try to bounce him to sleep and I got no response and the baby continued to crawl all over my head. Cool. So I just snapped.

I basically told him fine, you can sleep. I'll go into my 8am shift with no sleep. (Profanities were used because I was pretty pissed.) Got up and played with the baby. Made myself coffee because I had given up on sleeping. Did not care about how much noise I was making either.

And then maybe an hour later, my husband come out 
of the room mad at me, trying to tell me to go back to bed so it doesn't mess up the baby's schedule. The baby was up, up. Not drowsy awake, literally fully awake, talking, everything. He then proceeded to try to make it seem like I just was looking for an excuse to be on my phone?? I was on my phone twice last night, because like I said I was feeding him?? And I was literally on my stomach, trying to sleep before I gave up?? 

Before this, I was already agitated because I went to take a shower and he refused to take the baby because he wanted me (little mamas boy) but I was sweaty and covered in dog hair from work. So whatever, I hung out with the baby for an hour so he could get his mama fix. I put the baby in his play pen next to his computer and told him he was calmer now and that I was going to take a shower. I got half undressed when I heard the baby fall and start crying and run out to literally watch as my husband looked at him, looked at me, and then apparently because I was there he just ignored the baby. His excuse was that he apparently thought I was watching him?? I literally told him I was showering a few minutes before then.

He refuses to go to couples counseling because he had done therapy as a child and thinks it's pointless essentially. But he doesn't realize just how much of a problem we have with communication and I feel like having a third party to clarify things would help. There's been so many times in arguments and disagreements where we completely loose track of what we're fighting about because we misunderstood each other. I usually catch it and try to point it out but he just gets angry at that too trying to say I'm gaslighting him when I'm just trying to think out loud. I eventually just stop talking because I'm so over the stress of fighting and our conversation just goes no where.

He quite literally blames me for everything. I'm the reason why the place isn't clean, yet he never cleans? But oh, the mess from me making dinner for both of us is my mess. He wants a completely spotless house yet doesn't want to do any of the work for it. Literally will complain about how much dirt is everywhere, which is most likely coming from him more than me since he creates more foot traffic in/out of the place that I do, yet never sweeps unless I ask him to, and even then he drags his feet like I asked him to do something impossible.

He was never like this before the baby. I would cook, he would clean. He would take care of the dog responsibilities and I would take care of the cat and small animals. We had a system, and it worked. He was so good the first couple months when I was on maternity leave too, but as soon as I was back at work everything changed. 

I'm genuinely debating on going part time at work regardless of what he thinks about it. I work a commission job so it wouldn't really effect my income dropping a day. Two days off a week just is not enough time to catch up with everything as well as hosting or constantly making the trip to one of his parents houses every week. I'm working on just saying no when we have too much to get done, because frankly I don't understand the need to see your grandkid every two weeks, sometimes multiple times a week, especially when it's not to help us at all.(and they act like it's been forever since they've seen him every time).

This post ended up being a book, I'm sorry. If you made it this far, props to you.

1lmj3z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lmj3z3/killers_anonymous/,Killers Anonymous,"
When I found a post tucked away in the dark corners of the internet, my interest was piqued. It was titled: Killers Anonymous.

At first, I thought it was a joke made to scare or morbidly amuse people, but I was wrong.  It was a support group created for people like me. When I was about 18, I began to loathe life, and I couldn’t stand seeing my peers enjoying theirs. I would spend hours alone, but it grew into days of no contact. The drugs and alcohol I had been using started flooding my mind with unsavory things. I started fantasizing about death, and I imagined becoming the one who dishes it out. I would relish in thinning about the high I could achieve through such an act. A high that no drug could provide me. A high that I would never come down from. I knew it was wrong to think that way, but I couldn’t help but take pleasure from it.


After thoroughly reading the post, I was hesitant to apply. What if this were some new way for law enforcement to collect information on potentially dangerous people? I thought. I applied regardless, and after about a week, I finally received the confirmation email. The email contained almost all of the same information as the post. I scrolled down to the bottom, which contained their meeting schedule. “Hmm, next Friday?” I said. After I had passed the idea around in my head for several days, I decided to go. I was still nervous, but also excited. I was finally going to get the chance to speak about these urges, and not have someone shame me for them. At least I hoped I wouldn’t be. I had never told anyone about them before, but could you blame me? This isn’t exactly a problem everyone struggles with.


Friday came quickly, and as I stood outside the house I was told to meet at, anxiety began to build. Once again, what if all this was a setup? I thought. I swallowed my fears and made my way to the front door. I gave a few firm knocks, and a woman opened and greeted me. She was a cute brunette, and she looked to be in her late twenties.


“Oh hello, are you here for the group?” She said with a cheerfulness about her.


“Yes, yes I am,” I said as I reached out to shake her hand.


“Good to meet you,” she said while returning my gesture,” please come in and make yourself at home. We will be starting soon, but first, which group are you in?”


I paused and was confused by her question. “I thought it was just the one group?” I asked.


“Oh no, there are actually four groups,” she said, “one group wouldn’t be big enough. You would be surprised by how many people we get. Group 4 has fewer people if you would like to start with a smaller group.”


“I’ll be in group four then,” I said before walking inside.

Greeting me were two large living rooms to the right and left. Each room had chairs placed in a circular pattern. There was also a staircase leading into what looked like another large space.


“Your group is in the left room,” the woman explained, ”you made the right choice coming here, and I hope we can help.”


“Thank you,” I said before taking my seat.

After about thirty minutes of waiting, both of the bottom rooms now looked full of people. An older man in our circle, probably about sixty, stood from his chair and introduced himself.


“Hello everyone, my name is Troy Baker, and I’ll be mediating tonight. I would like to start by saying how proud I am that you’re all here tonight. I know all of you are probably nervous and hesitant, but I want you all to know you’re safe here. Now, I see that we have some new faces here tonight. Would anyone like to introduce themselves?” 


After a few seconds of silence, another man in the group broke the tension.

“I would,” he said, “My name is Mike.”


“Nice to meet you, Mike,” Troy responded, “Would you like to tell the group a bit about yourself and maybe why you’re here?”


“Umm sure,” Mike said with an unsure tone, “I was just a young boy when it started. It was small with just some thoughts, images, and fantasies. But after a few years, I started to experiment with dissecting animals. Mostly small ones like birds, rodents, and the occasional cat. Taking away the lives of animals brought a sense of comfort. I would strangle, stab, drown, electrocute, and then dismember them to finish. I felt in complete control, and my mind would become free and clear again. But the older I got, and the harder life got, I needed to do it more and more often.  Recently, it hasn’t been helping at all.


Mike went silent before Troy responded, “That was very brave of you son. Not a lot of people can open up about their thoughts and actions like that.”


Mike’s story fascinated me. I too had considered killing animals for pleasure, but I didn’t think it would provide enough satisfaction to satiate me. Besides, I actually liked and respected animals. It was people I had a vendetta against.


Troy turned his gaze towards me, “How about you son? Would you feel comfortable introducing yourself to the group?”


I nodded in agreement and told them about my disgust for people. About how I hated my own life, and explained my feelings towards how others enjoyed theirs. After I was done, I scanned the room. Everyone looked visibly uncomfortable with what I was saying. I took a deep breath before finishing, “but now I’m here, and looking for help.”


Troy stood again, “Thank you, Eli.” He said before giving me the same comforting message that he gave Mike.


After Troy sat back down, another woman raised her hand before saying she wanted to go next. She told the group about how she hated her parents and wanted to kill them. After she explained herself, she broke down in tears. Troy began to comfort her before calling the meeting to a close. After the group stood and exchanged pleasantries, I made my way over to Mike who was standing on the porch.


“Hey, it’s Mike right?” I said while tapping him on the shoulder.


“Yeah, What’s up?” He asked.


“I don’t have a whole lot of people who I can talk to about these sort of things, so I was wondering if you would like to get some lunch? I asked. 


“Umm, sure, why not?” He said with a sign of hesitation.


“Great! How does Jen’s Diner sound?” 


“Sounds good.” He said before giving a slight smile.


After a few-mile drive, I pulled into the diner parking lot. Mike pulled in right after. We walked inside and were approached by an attractive young waitress. 


“How many?” She asked.


“Two,” I answered, “and can we get a booth?”


“Sure can! Right this way.”


She guided us to our booth before asking, “So what can I start you two off with to drink?”


“I’ll take a water.” Said Mike.


“Sure thing, and you sir?” 


I looked deep into her eyes. She looked so sweet and innocent. “I’ll have the same,” I said with a smile.


“Okay, I’ll have those waters out to y’all shortly.” She said before walking off.


“So Eli, what made you want to join the… well…you know… the group?” Mike asked while seeming a bit fidgety.


“I guess I finally felt like it was time to get some help. Though, I don’t remember you ever saying what you wanted out of the group?” I asked.


“Well, I guess you could say I want help, but I also kinda don’t.” Mike said while looking down and avoiding eye contact.


“Same,” I said with a chuckle, “I want help, but I still really wanna try it at least once.”


His eyes looked up with a glimpse of curiosity curiosity in his eyes. “You know I was-“ Mike said before being cut off.


“Here are those waters,” said the waitress, “are y’all ready, or do you need a few more minutes?”


I looked at Mike and gestured to confirm before responding, “Yeah, we’re ready. I’ll take the club house sandwich and chips.”


“All righty, and what will you have?” She said while looking at Mike.


“I’ll have the working man’s burger with fries and no mayo please,” Mike said while looking more comfortable and open.


“Sure thing, I’ll be back with y’all’s orders as soon as it’s ready.” She said before once again, heading back to the kitchen.”


“Back to what I was saying,” Mike said after taking a sip of water, “I had an idea. What if just once, we follow through with our urges? You know… just to see if we truly have it in us or not.”


I felt it was a great idea before saying, “I don’t know, are you sure that’s something you want to do?”


“Yes,” he said with confidence, “I’ve been sure for a long time.”


When he said that, I could hear the seriousness in his tone.I reached out my hand to meet his. It felt like two partners agreeing on a business deal. After a few minutes went by, the waitress returned with our food.


“Here you are. One clubhouse sandwich with chips, and one working man’s burger with fries with no mayo. Enjoy!” 


We both thanked her before returning to our conversation. “So, do you have anyone in mind?” I said.


I saw him peer over my shoulder to the kitchen window. He looked like a hungry predator who had just caught sight of a plump hog. “How about her,” he said, “I think she would work.”


I turned to look back while having a good idea who he was referring to. It was at our gorgeous waitress. “Don’t you think she would be a bit risky? Especially, since she looks young and is probably known by a lot of customers? Wouldn’t people notice if she went missing?” I asked.


“Of course,” he said, “but there isn’t anyone going to suspect us. We’re nobodies to her with no connections.”


“Ok, we’ll do it,” I said hoping he was right.


A few more minutes went by, and we finished our meals. The waitress came and gave us our bills.


“Here you both are. Will you be needing anything else?” She asked.



“No,” Mike responded, “I think we’re good.”


As the waitress walked back to the kitchen, Mike was eyeballing her up and down. We made are way back to our vehicles. 


“Meet me here tomorrow, and we can start planning,” Mike said.


“Got it.” I agreed before shaking his hand once more.


I sat in my car while I watched Mike drive off in his truck. Soon after, I headed back home. I lived in a little apartment located in a more run-down part of town. It was all I could barely afford while working as a bookkeeper for a small local shop. Later that night while lying in bed and staring up at the ceiling, the feeling of losing control, which I was all too familiar with had returned to me. I thought long and hard trying to cling to the idea Mike and I had. I was hoping to be comforted by it, and it soon proved I was right. The next day, I met up with Mike at the diner at around seven o’clock in the evening just as we had planned. We had parked in the abandoned parking garage across the street to help get a better view. I got out of my car to hop into Mike older pick up truck.


“There she is,” Mike said while looking through a pair of binoculars, “hello gorgeous.”


“So what’s the plan here Mike?” I asked him.


“I think we should just follow her home to start. See if she lives with other people or not.” He responded.


After about two hours went by, the diner looked to be closing for the night. We sat a while longer and waited for the waitress to come out. About thirty minutes later, we saw her getting into her car. Mike started the engine, and we made our way to the garage exit. We followed her for what felt like thirty minutes out of town. She led us out into the country, which wasn’t a shock since we lived in a small rural town in Georgia. She pulled off onto a dirt road. We followed a bit longer before she pulled into what looked like a driveway. We crept up in front of her home with our headlights off. Mike pulled out his binoculars again.


“Should we just do it now?” I asked.


“No,” he answered sternly, “we don’t even know if she lives alone or not yet. Besides, I wanna take her back to my place. I live in a nice, quiet, and deserted place like this.”


“Your place?” I asked him.


“Yeah, my place. If I’m gonna do this, I want to do it right.” He said sounding like a tradesman talking about his craft.


“Okay,” I said not wanting to upset him.


He didn’t respond, and instead just kept watching her. She pulled out her keys, unlocked the front door, and went inside.


“Huh, she turned on the porch light. Maybe she is giving us the go-ahead to come on in.” Mike said while chuckling.


I laughed with him before he pressed on the gas pedal. After we hit paved road again, he asked me, “You wanna come over to my place? I’ll show you what I got prepped.”


Curious, I answered, “Sure, why not?”


“Great!” He said sounding excited, “I think you’ll love it, and I think it’ll help give you more confidence in our plan.”


He drove us back to his place, and he was right. It was in the middle of nowhere. A small mobile home on a piece of land that had a big barn In The back. We got out and walked around back to the barn.


“This is it,” he said sounding proud, “this is where we’re gonna do it.”


It looked old while littered with cobwebs and hay. The left wall when walking through the entrance, was covered in saws, hatchets, machetes, rakes, and even had a clever. It looked like a scene pulled right out of a slasher film. The right wall had metal rings, with what looked like chains and cuffs looped through them. They were lined up in a row leading all the way to the back, and it looked like a dungeon. Lastly, In the center was a large rectangular concrete slab, which looked to be about four feet high, seven feet in length, and another four feet in width. It too had metal loops drilled into it, and I could see leather straps lying on top.


“Wow, this is pretty impressive Mike. Are you sure you haven’t done this before?” I asked while laughing.


“No,” he said while grinning and laughing, “but I’ve been planning and thinking about it for years. I just haven’t had the gumption to finally commit to it, but now thanks to you, I do.”


“Well after getting a good look at this place, I think everything is gonna go great,” I said.


“Hey, do you wanna come in for a beer?” He asked.


“Sure, why not,” I said after checking my watch, “It’s only midnight. I’ll have one before we head back to my car”


We stepped back out through the large barn doors, and Mike locked them back before making our way to his mobile home. We walked inside with Mike leading the way, and I could hear Mike fumbling around while trying to find the light switch. Finally, the lights came on, and Mike went to the kitchen to fetch us a couple of beers.


“So do you live alone here, or do your folks live here too?” I asked.


“I got this place all to myself. My parents passed a few years back, and since I’m an only child, it all got left to me.” He said before handing me a beer. 


“What happened to them?” I asked hoping not to upset him.


“Died right in there,” Mike said while pointing to what looked like a master bedroom, “ I woke one day and found them still in bed. Cold to the touch and not moving. You know I buried them out back. Momma always hated the idea of being buried in a place full of strangers, so figured home would be more comfortable for her.”


“And what about your dad, is he buried here too?” I asked, very curious to know more.


“Technically,” Mike said before letting out a loud laugh, “as long as you consider being turn into pig shit being buried. Even that is probably too good for him.”


Not wanting to push the subject further, I kept silent and nodded. We continued talking for a bit longer while we finished our beers. As I stood up from his couch ready to head back, I started feeling nauseous and could barely hold my footing.


“Can’t handle one beer?” He said before I finally stumbled to the floor. 


“Ice water,” I said while trying to hold back vomit. Mike nodded before bringing me a glass. I poured some on my face, but it didn’t help. I was in and out of consciousness for many hours, but I do remember feeling rocks and sticks rubbing against my back like I was being dragged. Next, I could hear chains rattling, and soon after, metal cuffs clamped shut around my wrists. I felt the metal dig tightly into my skin. After that, I didn’t come to until a stinging beam of sunlight pierced my eye lids from a hole in the barn wall. I looked around still feeling the lingering effects from whatever was in my drink. It was hot and humid, and my clothes were drenched in sweat. My hands were numb from being in the cuffs for so long. Mike was nowhere in sight, and I couldn’t  hear much of anything outside. I tried wiggling the chains loose, but I had no luck. As the day went by, and the lingering effects went away, so did the sunlight. The sun was setting, and the barn was soon plunged into darkness. Headlights shot through cracks in the walls and lit up the barn. Soon after, I heard the sound of crunching pine straw coming towards the barn. The sound of the barn doors opening sent chills up my spine, I started hyperventilating, and my stomach turned from the thought of what he was gonna do to me.


“Breathe Eli,” said Mike after turning on the bright overhead lights, “I haven’t even started yet.”


“Wha… why are you doing this? I thought we were a team?” I said after catching my breath.


“No Eli. We weren’t a team. I do like you though, so I’m sorry I have to do this. If I had the strength to not give in to my temptations, I would.” He said in a dead monotone voice that I had yet heard from him.


“What are you going to do to me?” I asked while trying to control my breath.


“Eli, I’m gonna be honest with you. It’s not gonna be good for you. I have temptations and compulsions that go beyond just killing.” He said before filling a syringe. 


My stomach and chest burned with fear, and I feel my body wanting to convulse. He walked over to me before sticking me in the arm with the needle. I was begging him to stop, but he just told me to hush. It didn’t take long for the effects to take hold, and I was out like a light again. After I returned to what I assumed was going to be a brief time back in the land of the living, I found myself lying on the concrete slab. My legs, arms, torso, and neck had leather straps tethering me to it. After many hours of being restricted from using the restroom, I could smell my soiled clothes. I felt like an animal locked in a pen and ready for the slaughter. As I laid there marinating in my own waste, I could hear whistling approaching the barn. Once again, the loud noise from the barn doors opening filled the air.


“Good lord man, it smells like fucking piss and shit in here,” he said while chuckling, “perhaps I should have put you in some diapers.”


I didn’t say anything in response. I didn’t have anything left to say to Mike that wasn’t already said. He then grabbed the cleaver that was hanging on the wall before walking over to me. He rubbed my legs down with what smelled like alcohol. After he had wiped down my legs, he grabbed my left leg to hold it still, and then raised his right arm holding the cleaver. He looked like a butcher ready to get to work. His arm swung down in full force, and I heard the bones in my leg crunch. A sharp pain rang loud through my leg. With every swing, I hear crunch after crunch. I could hear my flesh tearing and my blood gushing out. I started to blacked out from the pain.


“No, no, no,” Mike yelled after splashing ice-cold water in my face, “we’re not done yet.”


I looked down at my body, and I could see my leg. It was sitting in a gray bucket that had been set between my legs. I threw up from the gruesome sight. Mike wiped my blood from his hands and face with a cloth before grabbing my right leg.


“Almost done Eli.” He said before hacking away again. I saw my blood splash across his face once more. The pain was too severe for me to stay conscious. The next thing I remember was ice-cold water soaking my face, and once again, bringing me back.


“All done for now,” he said while patting my face, “you sewed up real nice Eli.”


I looked back down to see that the bucket was gone, but so were both of my legs. I had stitches all over the nubs where my legs once were. Everything from just below my knees was gone.


“Come on let’s get you chained back up,” Mike said while undoing the arm straps.


“No needles this time?” I asked him sarcastically.


“Planning on running away?” He asked while returning the same sarcastic tone before letting out a sickening laugh. He then picked me up, and tossed me over his shoulder. As he was walking me back over to the chains, I saw that he had an old pocket knife tucked in his back pocket. I reached for it, and luckily my arms were just long enough. I managed to grab it and drive it into the back of Mike's neck. I fell and hit the ground hard after Mike dropped me. He stumbled for a second before finally hitting the ground as well. His clothes were soaked in blood, and I couldn’t tell how much was mine or his. Mike leaned up against the concrete slab before showing me his eyes, which were now filled with rage.


“Fuck you!” He yelled in between spitting up blood. Eventually, his words became nothing more than bloody gurgling, and then his body went limp. I crawled to the barn doors and was barely able to get one of them open. I managed to make it to the mobile home before finding my cellphone in his nightstand. I called the police and told them the address, which I found off a piece of mail sitting on the coffee table. I sat on the floor in his room until the police finally busted down the front door. Two officers rushed in and lifted me up before carrying me outside. Two paramedics met them, and they took care of me from there. The whole ride in the back of the ambulance, all I could think about was what would happen if Mike had some evidence of what we were planning together. After they got me to the hospital, they cleaned my wounds and redid the stitches. A few hours went by and an officer walked into my room.


“How are you doing son?” The officer asked.


“I could be better,” I said before letting out a grown from the pain.


“I’m sorry for asking. Anyway, I’m Detective Harrington,” he responded, “and I wanted to ask you about the man who did this while your memory is still fresh.”


I was reluctant, but I knew he was probably right. “Sure, what do you need to know?”


“Do you remember what happened when he abducted you?”


“It was while I was walking out to my car a few days ago.” I lied hoping he would buy it.


“And do you remember where this happened?” He asked.


“No,” I lied again, “I don’t remember much of what happened before waking up in the barn. He stuck me in the neck with something and I was out.”


“Okay, okay and did the perpetrator ever mention anything about his parents, or maybe a woman by the name of Emily Baker. Detective Harrington asked.


“He told me they died a few years back, but not much else, and I don’t know an Emily Baker. Who is she?” I asked.


He scratched his beard and finished writing in his notes before saying, “We think she was who he was targeting next. She’s just some waitress at a local diner, but you don’t need to worry about those details.”


“You sure?”


“I’m positive son. You just get some rest. We’ll we can continue after you get a little better” He said before stepping back out.


After a few days in the hospital, the doctors saw me fit to go home and I was wheeled out to my father’s car. He thanked the nurse for wheeling me out before he loaded me into his car. On the way home, he tried talking to me and asked me questions about what had happened, but I didn’t answer. I stared out the window not saying a word. After he figured out I wasn’t up for talking, we finished the ride in silence. When we pulled into the driveway, he helped me inside and laid me down in the guest bedroom. While lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling not blinking or uttering a word. I could feel pain in my legs that weren’t there. I hated the bastard for what he did to me. I felt betrayed by someone who I thought was becoming my friend. By someone just like me. I guess it’s for the best though. Now nobody has to worry about what I could do anymore.",1,1751104557.0,scarystories,0,0.99,False
1lmj3fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingAlone/comments/1lmj3fa/finding_joy_and_overcoming_loneliness_in_my_first/,Finding Joy and Overcoming Loneliness in My First Year of Living Alone.,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been living alone for about a year now, and it’s been quite the journey. At first, I was excited about the independence and freedom , no compromises on what to watch, when to eat, or how to decorate. But I also didn’t expect the bouts of loneliness and the moments when the silence felt overwhelming.

What’s helped me the most is creating small daily rituals , morning coffee on the balcony, cooking a new recipe each week, and setting up video calls with friends regularly. It’s these little things that make my space feel like home and keep me connected.

I’d love to hear from others:

* What surprised you most about living solo?
* How do you handle the tougher days?
* Any tips for building a fulfilling solo lifestyle?

Thanks for being such a supportive community , I’m grateful to share this experience with all of you.",1,1751104496.0,LivingAlone,1,1.0,False
1lmj2wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lmj2wd/killers_anonymous/,Killers Anonymous,"When I found a post tucked away in the dark corners of the internet, my interest was piqued. It was titled: Killers Anonymous.

At first, I thought it was a joke made to scare or morbidly amuse people, but I was wrong.  It was a support group created for people like me. When I was about 18, I began to loathe life, and I couldn’t stand seeing my peers enjoying theirs. I would spend hours alone, but it grew into days of no contact. The drugs and alcohol I had been using started flooding my mind with unsavory things. I started fantasizing about death, and I imagined becoming the one who dishes it out. I would relish in thinning about the high I could achieve through such an act. A high that no drug could provide me. A high that I would never come down from. I knew it was wrong to think that way, but I couldn’t help but take pleasure from it.


After thoroughly reading the post, I was hesitant to apply. What if this were some new way for law enforcement to collect information on potentially dangerous people? I thought. I applied regardless, and after about a week, I finally received the confirmation email. The email contained almost all of the same information as the post. I scrolled down to the bottom, which contained their meeting schedule. “Hmm, next Friday?” I said. After I had passed the idea around in my head for several days, I decided to go. I was still nervous, but also excited. I was finally going to get the chance to speak about these urges, and not have someone shame me for them. At least I hoped I wouldn’t be. I had never told anyone about them before, but could you blame me? This isn’t exactly a problem everyone struggles with.


Friday came quickly, and as I stood outside the house I was told to meet at, anxiety began to build. Once again, what if all this was a setup? I thought. I swallowed my fears and made my way to the front door. I gave a few firm knocks, and a woman opened and greeted me. She was a cute brunette, and she looked to be in her late twenties.


“Oh hello, are you here for the group?” She said with a cheerfulness about her.


“Yes, yes I am,” I said as I reached out to shake her hand.


“Good to meet you,” she said while returning my gesture,” please come in and make yourself at home. We will be starting soon, but first, which group are you in?”


I paused and was confused by her question. “I thought it was just the one group?” I asked.


“Oh no, there are actually four groups,” she said, “one group wouldn’t be big enough. You would be surprised by how many people we get. Group 4 has fewer people if you would like to start with a smaller group.”


“I’ll be in group four then,” I said before walking inside.

Greeting me were two large living rooms to the right and left. Each room had chairs placed in a circular pattern. There was also a staircase leading into what looked like another large space.


“Your group is in the left room,” the woman explained, ”you made the right choice coming here, and I hope we can help.”


“Thank you,” I said before taking my seat.

After about thirty minutes of waiting, both of the bottom rooms now looked full of people. An older man in our circle, probably about sixty, stood from his chair and introduced himself.


“Hello everyone, my name is Troy Baker, and I’ll be mediating tonight. I would like to start by saying how proud I am that you’re all here tonight. I know all of you are probably nervous and hesitant, but I want you all to know you’re safe here. Now, I see that we have some new faces here tonight. Would anyone like to introduce themselves?” 


After a few seconds of silence, another man in the group broke the tension.

“I would,” he said, “My name is Mike.”


“Nice to meet you, Mike,” Troy responded, “Would you like to tell the group a bit about yourself and maybe why you’re here?”


“Umm sure,” Mike said with an unsure tone, “I was just a young boy when it started. It was small with just some thoughts, images, and fantasies. But after a few years, I started to experiment with dissecting animals. Mostly small ones like birds, rodents, and the occasional cat. Taking away the lives of animals brought a sense of comfort. I would strangle, stab, drown, electrocute, and then dismember them to finish. I felt in complete control, and my mind would become free and clear again. But the older I got, and the harder life got, I needed to do it more and more often.  Recently, it hasn’t been helping at all.


Mike went silent before Troy responded, “That was very brave of you son. Not a lot of people can open up about their thoughts and actions like that.”


Mike’s story fascinated me. I too had considered killing animals for pleasure, but I didn’t think it would provide enough satisfaction to satiate me. Besides, I actually liked and respected animals. It was people I had a vendetta against.


Troy turned his gaze towards me, “How about you son? Would you feel comfortable introducing yourself to the group?”


I nodded in agreement and told them about my disgust for people. About how I hated my own life, and explained my feelings towards how others enjoyed theirs. After I was done, I scanned the room. Everyone looked visibly uncomfortable with what I was saying. I took a deep breath before finishing, “but now I’m here, and looking for help.”


Troy stood again, “Thank you, Eli.” He said before giving me the same comforting message that he gave Mike.


After Troy sat back down, another woman raised her hand before saying she wanted to go next. She told the group about how she hated her parents and wanted to kill them. After she explained herself, she broke down in tears. Troy began to comfort her before calling the meeting to a close. After the group stood and exchanged pleasantries, I made my way over to Mike who was standing on the porch.


“Hey, it’s Mike right?” I said while tapping him on the shoulder.


“Yeah, What’s up?” He asked.


“I don’t have a whole lot of people who I can talk to about these sort of things, so I was wondering if you would like to get some lunch? I asked. 


“Umm, sure, why not?” He said with a sign of hesitation.


“Great! How does Jen’s Diner sound?” 


“Sounds good.” He said before giving a slight smile.


After a few-mile drive, I pulled into the diner parking lot. Mike pulled in right after. We walked inside and were approached by an attractive young waitress. 


“How many?” She asked.


“Two,” I answered, “and can we get a booth?”


“Sure can! Right this way.”


She guided us to our booth before asking, “So what can I start you two off with to drink?”


“I’ll take a water.” Said Mike.


“Sure thing, and you sir?” 


I looked deep into her eyes. She looked so sweet and innocent. “I’ll have the same,” I said with a smile.


“Okay, I’ll have those waters out to y’all shortly.” She said before walking off.


“So Eli, what made you want to join the… well…you know… the group?” Mike asked while seeming a bit fidgety.


“I guess I finally felt like it was time to get some help. Though, I don’t remember you ever saying what you wanted out of the group?” I asked.


“Well, I guess you could say I want help, but I also kinda don’t.” Mike said while looking down and avoiding eye contact.


“Same,” I said with a chuckle, “I want help, but I still really wanna try it at least once.”


His eyes looked up with a glimpse of curiosity curiosity in his eyes. “You know I was-“ Mike said before being cut off.


“Here are those waters,” said the waitress, “are y’all ready, or do you need a few more minutes?”


I looked at Mike and gestured to confirm before responding, “Yeah, we’re ready. I’ll take the club house sandwich and chips.”


“All righty, and what will you have?” She said while looking at Mike.


“I’ll have the working man’s burger with fries and no mayo please,” Mike said while looking more comfortable and open.


“Sure thing, I’ll be back with y’all’s orders as soon as it’s ready.” She said before once again, heading back to the kitchen.”


“Back to what I was saying,” Mike said after taking a sip of water, “I had an idea. What if just once, we follow through with our urges? You know… just to see if we truly have it in us or not.”


I felt it was a great idea before saying, “I don’t know, are you sure that’s something you want to do?”


“Yes,” he said with confidence, “I’ve been sure for a long time.”


When he said that, I could hear the seriousness in his tone.I reached out my hand to meet his. It felt like two partners agreeing on a business deal. After a few minutes went by, the waitress returned with our food.


“Here you are. One clubhouse sandwich with chips, and one working man’s burger with fries with no mayo. Enjoy!” 


We both thanked her before returning to our conversation. “So, do you have anyone in mind?” I said.


I saw him peer over my shoulder to the kitchen window. He looked like a hungry predator who had just caught sight of a plump hog. “How about her,” he said, “I think she would work.”


I turned to look back while having a good idea who he was referring to. It was at our gorgeous waitress. “Don’t you think she would be a bit risky? Especially, since she looks young and is probably known by a lot of customers? Wouldn’t people notice if she went missing?” I asked.


“Of course,” he said, “but there isn’t anyone going to suspect us. We’re nobodies to her with no connections.”


“Ok, we’ll do it,” I said hoping he was right.


A few more minutes went by, and we finished our meals. The waitress came and gave us our bills.


“Here you both are. Will you be needing anything else?” She asked.



“No,” Mike responded, “I think we’re good.”


As the waitress walked back to the kitchen, Mike was eyeballing her up and down. We made are way back to our vehicles. 


“Meet me here tomorrow, and we can start planning,” Mike said.


“Got it.” I agreed before shaking his hand once more.


I sat in my car while I watched Mike drive off in his truck. Soon after, I headed back home. I lived in a little apartment located in a more run-down part of town.

I laughed with him before he pressed on the gas pedal. After we hit paved road again, he asked me, “You wanna come over to my place? I’ll show you what I got prepped.”


Curious, I answered, “Sure, why not?”


“Great!” He said sounding excited, “I think you’ll love it, and I think it’ll help give you more confidence in our plan.”


He drove us back to his place, and he was right. It was in the middle of nowhere. A small mobile home on a piece of land that had a big barn In The back. We got out and walked around back to the barn.


“This is it,” he said sounding proud, “this is where we’re gonna do it.”


It looked old while littered with cobwebs and hay. The left wall when walking through the entrance, was covered in saws, hatchets, machetes, rakes, and even had a clever. It looked like a scene pulled right out of a slasher film. The right wall had metal rings, with what looked like chains and cuffs looped through them. They were lined up in a row leading all the way to the back, and it looked like a dungeon. Lastly, In the center was a large rectangular concrete slab, which looked to be about four feet high, seven feet in length, and another four feet in width. It too had metal loops drilled into it, and I could see leather straps lying on top.


“Wow, this is pretty impressive Mike. Are you sure you haven’t done this before?” I asked while laughing.


“No,” he said while grinning and laughing, “but I’ve been planning and thinking about it for years. I just haven’t had the gumption to finally commit to it, but now thanks to you, I do.”


“Well after getting a good look at this place, I think everything is gonna go great,” I said.


“Hey, do you wanna come in for a beer?” He asked.


“Sure, why not,” I said after checking my watch, “It’s only midnight. I’ll have one before we head back to my car”


We stepped back out through the large barn doors, and Mike locked them back before making our way to his mobile home. We walked inside with Mike leading the way, and I could hear Mike fumbling around while trying to find the light switch. Finally, the lights came on, and Mike went to the kitchen to fetch us a couple of beers.


“So do you live alone here, or do your folks live here too?” I asked.


“I got this place all to myself. My parents passed a few years back, and since I’m an only child, it all got left to me.” He said before handing me a beer. 


“What happened to them?” I asked hoping not to upset him.


“Died right in there,” Mike said while pointing to what looked like a master bedroom, “ I woke one day and found them still in bed. Cold to the touch and not moving. You know I buried them out back. Momma always hated the idea of being buried in a place full of strangers, so figured home would be more comfortable for her.”


“And what about your dad, is he buried here too?” I asked, very curious to know more.


“Technically,” Mike said before letting out a loud laugh, “as long as you consider being turn into pig shit being buried. Even that is probably too good for him.”


Not wanting to push the subject further, I kept silent and nodded. We continued talking for a bit longer while we finished our beers. As I stood up from his couch ready to head back, I started feeling nauseous and could barely hold my footing.


“Can’t handle one beer?” He said before I finally stumbled to the floor. 


“Ice water,” I said while trying to hold back vomit. Mike nodded before bringing me a glass. I poured some on my face, but it didn’t help. I was in and out of consciousness for many hours, but I do remember feeling rocks and sticks rubbing against my back like I was being dragged. Next, I could hear chains rattling, and soon after, metal cuffs clamped shut around my wrists. I felt the metal dig tightly into my skin. After that, I didn’t come to until a stinging beam of sunlight pierced my eye lids from a hole in the barn wall. I looked around still feeling the lingering effects from whatever was in my drink. It was hot and humid, and my clothes were drenched in sweat. My hands were numb from being in the cuffs for so long. Mike was nowhere in sight, and I couldn’t  hear much of anything outside. I tried wiggling the chains loose, but I had no luck. As the day went by, and the lingering effects went away, so did the sunlight. The sun was setting, and the barn was soon plunged into darkness. Headlights shot through cracks in the walls and lit up the barn. Soon after, I heard the sound of crunching pine straw coming towards the barn. The sound of the barn doors opening sent chills up my spine, I started hyperventilating, and my stomach turned from the thought of what he was gonna do to me.


“Breathe Eli,” said Mike after turning on the bright overhead lights, “I haven’t even started yet.”


“Wha… why are you doing this? I thought we were a team?” I said after catching my breath.


“No Eli. We weren’t a team. I do like you though, so I’m sorry I have to do this. If I had the strength to not give in to my temptations, I would.” He said in a dead monotone voice that I had yet heard from him.


“What are you going to do to me?” I asked while trying to control my breath.


“Eli, I’m gonna be honest with you. It’s not gonna be good for you. I have temptations and compulsions that go beyond just killing.” He said before filling a syringe. 


My stomach and chest burned with fear, and I feel my body wanting to convulse. He walked over to me before sticking me in the arm with the needle. I was begging him to stop, but he just told me to hush. It didn’t take long for the effects to take hold, and I was out like a light again. After I returned to what I assumed was going to be a brief time back in the land of the living, I found myself lying on the concrete slab. My legs, arms, torso, and neck had leather straps tethering me to it. After many hours of being restricted from using the restroom, I could smell my soiled clothes. I felt like an animal locked in a pen and ready for the slaughter. As I laid there marinating in my own waste, I could hear whistling approaching the barn. Once again, the loud noise from the barn doors opening filled the air.


“Good lord man, it smells like fucking piss and shit in here,” he said while chuckling, “perhaps I should have put you in some diapers.”


I didn’t say anything in response. I didn’t have anything left to say to Mike that wasn’t already said. He then grabbed the cleaver that was hanging on the wall before walking over to me. He rubbed my legs down with what smelled like alcohol. After he had wiped down my legs, he grabbed my left leg to hold it still, and then raised his right arm holding the cleaver. He looked like a butcher ready to get to work. His arm swung down in full force, and I heard the bones in my leg crunch. A sharp pain rang loud through my leg. With every swing, I hear crunch after crunch. I could hear my flesh tearing and my blood gushing out. I started to blacked out from the pain.


“No, no, no,” Mike yelled after splashing ice-cold water in my face, “we’re not done yet.”


I looked down at my body, and I could see my leg. It was sitting in a gray bucket that had been set between my legs. I threw up from the gruesome sight. Mike wiped my blood from his hands and face with a cloth before grabbing my right leg.


“Almost done Eli.” He said before hacking away again. I saw my blood splash across his face once more. The pain was too severe for me to stay conscious. The next thing I remember was ice-cold water soaking my face, and once again, bringing me back.


“All done for now,” he said while patting my face, “you sewed up real nice Eli.”


I looked back down to see that the bucket was gone, but so were both of my legs. I had stitches all over the nubs where my legs once were. Everything from just below my knees was gone.


“Come on let’s get you chained back up,” Mike said while undoing the arm straps.


“No needles this time?” I asked him sarcastically.


“Planning on running away?” He asked while returning the same sarcastic tone before letting out a sickening laugh. He then picked me up, and tossed me over his shoulder. As he was walking me back over to the chains, I saw that he had an old pocket knife tucked in his back pocket. I reached for it, and luckily my arms were just long enough. I managed to grab it and drive it into the back of Mike's neck. I fell and hit the ground hard after Mike dropped me. He stumbled for a second before finally hitting the ground as well. His clothes were soaked in blood, and I couldn’t tell how much was mine or his. Mike leaned up against the concrete slab before showing me his eyes, which were now filled with rage.


“Fuck you!” He yelled in between spitting up blood. Eventually, his words became nothing more than bloody gurgling, and then his body went limp. I crawled to the barn doors and was barely able to get one of them open. I managed to make it to the mobile home before finding my cellphone in his nightstand. I called the police and told them the address, which I found off a piece of mail sitting on the coffee table. I sat on the floor in his room until the police finally busted down the front door. Two officers rushed in and lifted me up before carrying me outside. Two paramedics met them, and they took care of me from there. The whole ride in the back of the ambulance, all I could think about was what would happen if Mike had some evidence of what we were planning together. After they got me to the hospital, they cleaned my wounds and redid the stitches. A few hours went by and an officer walked into my room.


“How are you doing son?” The officer asked.


“I could be better,” I said before letting out a grown from the pain.


“I’m sorry for asking. Anyway, I’m Detective Harrington,” he responded, “and I wanted to ask you about the man who did this while your memory is still fresh.”


I was reluctant, but I knew he was probably right. “Sure, what do you need to know?”


“Do you remember what happened when he abducted you?”


“It was while I was walking out to my car a few days ago.” I lied hoping he would buy it.


“And do you remember where this happened?” He asked.


“No,” I lied again, “I don’t remember much of what happened before waking up in the barn. He stuck me in the neck with something and I was out.”


“Okay, okay and did the perpetrator ever mention anything about his parents, or maybe a woman by the name of Emily Baker. Detective Harrington asked.


“He told me they died a few years back, but not much else, and I don’t know an Emily Baker. Who is she?” I asked.


He scratched his beard and finished writing in his notes before saying, “We think she was who he was targeting next. She’s just some waitress at a local diner, but you don’t need to worry about those details.”


“You sure?”


“I’m positive son. You just get some rest. We’ll we can continue after you get a little better” He said before stepping back out.


After a few days in the hospital, the doctors saw me fit to go home and I was wheeled out to my father’s car. He thanked the nurse for wheeling me out before he loaded me into his car. On the way home, he tried talking to me and asked me questions about what had happened, but I didn’t answer. I stared out the window not saying a word. After he figured out I wasn’t up for talking, we finished the ride in silence. When we pulled into the driveway, he helped me inside and laid me down in the guest bedroom. While lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling not blinking or uttering a word. I could feel pain in my legs that weren’t there. I hated the bastard for what he did to me. I felt betrayed by someone who I thought was becoming my friend. By someone just like me. I guess it’s for the best though. Now nobody has to worry about what I could do anymore.",2,1751104435.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I moved to India almost 2 months ago. It has been challenging - the work is not going too well and I am still adjusting to the life here.

I am 38 and my mother still likes to micromanage every aspect of my life.  If I want to drink coffee before starting work, it is not allowed. If I want to go to the gym, it is not allowed as she does not like what she calls as ""inflated"" pecs on men. If I am ordering something from Amazon for cleanliness or personal grooming, it is not allowed and she says that I am wasting money. She raised a hue and cry over me ordering paper towels to clean the exhaust panel in kitchen (it was covered in lizard droppings!). My job is toxic and If I want to leave before the record starts appearing in background checks, it is not allowed. Growing up, like with most Indian parents, I was never allowed to pick a career or degree of my choosing. I thought that when I would be near 40, I would have some freedom but freedom is a ""bad word"" in India. If you want some level of control on your life, it is implied by others that you are selfish. I wonder if this is the story in every Indian household.

For those who moved back, any advice on how did you set boundaries with your parents? Did you move out? If you were not able to move out, how did you manage the balance between living your life and taking care of your parents and not upsetting them?",2,1751104194.0,returnToIndia,2,1.0,False

It was a long walk from Bhagsu, and technically, I should have ordered a juice, but, being me, I ordered an espresso. Yeah, it was the Italian Kitchen. I normally avoid it because of the crowd, but to my surprise that day, it was nearly empty.

When I entered, I noticed two elderly women at the corner by the window. One was a monk, and the other looked like her mother. I sat next to them, and their conversation was in Tibetan. Every time the monk stopped eating, her mother urged her to continue, and it was like a poem. Trust me, both had wrinkles, yet the care and sternness the mother exhibited reminded me of every Indian mom.

I had a video call to attend, but I couldn’t take my eyes off them. Though I couldn’t understand their words, their gestures spoke a million words. I kept praising the American on the video call; it’s my job to make them feel important so we can secure the money, and they feel intelligent and valued. It’s just business.

The lady was surely in her 70s, and her daughter was quite old too. Those tiny gestures between them were like poetry. That’s what I love about humans; sometimes it’s pure telepathy. Words and language—who needs them when hearts and minds melt? Their wrinkles told their own stories, and I could hear a violin, no, a cello in the background. It wasn’t sadness; it was something else—a life well-lived, yet with unfinished stories.

When it was time to depart, the mother started crying uncontrollably. Indian mothers, they are quite special, aren’t they? The monk was in tears too. It doesn’t matter who you become; you’re still someone’s daughter. They say even the Buddha ended his meditation because of motherly affection and chose the middle path. I don’t know about him, but this scene made me think of my own mother. I called her; she picked up, called me an idiot, and hung up. I’d forgotten she’d mentioned being at the temple 30 minutes earlier. I lost track of time—my bad.

The mother struggled to get up, and so did her monk daughter. Both laughed! Like two kids, they hugged, and that was my best moment in McLeodganj. Should I order one more espresso? Who cares? None of us is getting out of here alive. So, I did order one.",1,1751104002.0,Dharamshala,0,1.0,False

I hate that there is no milk customisation on the e8. All I can select is the time for ‘milk foam’. So if I make a cappuccino with 15 seconds of milk foam or a flat white with same, I end up with the same frothy coffee in essence. 

Conversely my brother’s z10 let’s you choose a time for milk (steamed) and a time for milk foam letting you actually differentiate properly so you can have a flat white without a centimetre of foam on top. 

I’m considering a j8 or s8 instead of my e8 and wondering whether anyone has personal experience with the milk on that? I see it has a dial on the milk dispenser that lets you choose how much air goes through the nozzle. But I’m not sure if it runs just the one milk selection like the e8 and you manually shift the dial or is it like the z10 where you can select both milk and milk foam times, then also change the milk ‘foaminess’ level with the manual dial.

First time poster on this sub, and have been making speciality coffee for almost 2 years now, slowly increasing my skills and my technique over time. I've found this sub to be a great place to be involved in, and I look forward to being active for the time being. If there's anything that I'm doing wrong or anything I can improve, please do let me know. Also open to all comments, will try to reply.

Not a professional, just an enthusiast. Also not a paid influencer, I bought the beans and have received no incentive to promote.

**About the Coffee** - Coffee beans grown in my hometown of Kalimpong, roasted and distributed by Himalaya Cornerstone Coffee based out of Siliguri, West Bengal. They are also very active in the local coffee scene. Beans are not available online but can be ordered directly from Cafe Andante or through their Instagram handle, and they do give you the ability to choose the roast level you want for each bag. These are the easiest beans for me to acquire as I live here.

**How I am Rating the beans** : (It's just vibes)
I'm rating them out of strength and not on how much I'm liking them. For example, if i burn the beans on the Moka pot, it's a 5 bitterness, not a 0.

• **Aroma** - Based on how strongly i smell the coffee, & if I can distinguish the smell. For this coffee for example, it's quite floral on Hoffmann's v60 technique.

• **Sweetness** - Hard to describe as it's complex. Maybe something like a lingering taste? I mainly deal with it out of feel.

• **Acidity** - Based on sourness. Not a huge fan of higher acidity, so between 1-2 is good for me.

• **Bitterness** - Self-explanatory.

• **Body** - Based on mouthfeel and how it coats the inside of my mouth. ",3,1751103691.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1lmivhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/comments/1lmivhe/i_inherited_something_i_wasnt_meant_to_touch/,I Inherited Something I Wasn't Meant to Touch,"My grandfather died on a Monday.

There wasn’t much of a funeral. Just me, my mom, a minister he didn’t know, and a few neighbors pretending they’d stayed in touch. The kind of burial where the only sounds are damp soil and cheap shoes on wet grass. No hymns or speeches. Just quiet, light rain.

He didn’t have much family left. I guess that left me – a half-remembered grandson he hadn’t seen in years. My mother never let me visit him when I was younger, for reasons I now understand. Aside from a couple awkward phone calls and a Christmas visit where he barely looked at me, we didn’t talk. Not because he was cruel or anything, just… hollowed out. Like whatever was inside of him had been thinned out over time.

He worked salvage in the 1970s – marine recovery, according to his dive logs. Dozens of vessels, hundreds of entries. Some of the pages were water-damaged in a way that didn’t quite match the rest. The nurse told me he died quietly in his sleep, without pain or confusion.

They were wrong about that part.

The day after the funeral, a package arrived. There was nothing on it other than my name, printed neatly in the center. Inside I found a cold, \*cold\* ring, wrapped in a torn piece of paper. Nothing else – no note, explanation or mention of my grandfather. But I knew. Somehow, I knew it was from him.

The ring looked handmade. Crude brass. No engraving, just a faint wave pattern around the outer band, as if someone had traced a current and forgotten how it ended. It didn’t shine – even in light, it seemed to absorb reflection. Also, it felt dry – not in a normal way, but in a way that resisted touch, like it remembered the cold better than it remembered hands.

I placed it on my desk and left it there for hours. I told myself I wouldn’t try it on – probably some mean-spirited prank by local kids who think grief makes you a fair target. Not like I was that sad about it, but still – screwing with the dead is a line.

Around midnight, I gave in. I just wanted to see how it fit.

It slid on tightly – too tightly, like it didn’t belong there. Then suddenly, it loosened. Not like it was stretching, but like my finger had adjusted to make room for it. The brass felt heavier than it looked. Heavier than any ring that size should feel. There was a moment where I caught my reflection in the window and thought I saw a hand resting on my shoulder. I quickly took it off.

That was it. No dramatic pain, no voice, no vision. But the skin beneath the ring looked slightly wrinkled – like it had been submerged.

I shoved it into a drawer and shut it tight. I’m a paranoid person by nature, and wanted to make sure it stayed put – I didn’t throw it out though. What if it really was from my grandfather?

That night I woke up twice.

The first time, I thought I heard footsteps – faint, wet footsteps – not on the floor, but above me. One slow step at a time, like someone was surveying the room.

The second time, it was the dream.

I was underwater, my arms limp, my feet numb. I wasn’t sinking, but wasn’t floating either – just simply existing. No light above, no darkness below. Just cold, and a distant creaking, like old wood.

Something touched my ankle.

I couldn’t scream – I opened my mouth to try, and the water didn’t rush in like it should.

I woke up coughing in a cold sweat. For a second, I really thought I was still under.

When I got up, I checked the drawer, just to be sure.

It was still there. Still cold. Still dry.

The next morning felt like a hangover I hadn’t earned. My mouth was dry, my eyes stung, and I had that weird sensation in my eyes like I’d cried in my sleep.

It was Saturday, thankfully. I made coffee and sat by the window. It had rained in the night. The street was soaked, but my porch looked *wetter* – like someone had deliberately sprayed it down.

I thought about calling my mom. Maybe she’d know something about the ring. Or about him. But before I could even reach for my phone, someone knocked. I groaned, assuming it was the neighbor’s kids again. Maybe they kicked a ball over to my yard.

I was wrong.

Three people. Two men, one woman, all in dark coats that looked too dry for the weather.

They studied me. Not like strangers. Like professionals. Their eyes lingered on my hands – out of instinct, I tucked them behind my back.

“Sorry, can I help you?” I asked, trying to sound casual, and miserably failing at it.

“It’s been worn, hasn’t it?” the woman coldly asked. “And you took it off. That’s worse.”

One of the men stepped forward, looked past me and down the hall – his expression was hard to read. Disgust or disappointment maybe.

The woman continued: “It belongs to you now. We don’t take what’s bound.”

They stepped back. “If the dreams worsen, we’ll be back.”

And then they were gone.

I shut the door, rushed over to the drawer again. They never mentioned the ring – not directly. But I knew. What else could it be?

The ring was still inside. Still cold. But the bottom of the drawer was now damp.

The rest of the day dragged by like a fever I didn’t know I had.

I tried to ignore it – but how could I? These people looked too official, too… prepared. I went online, half-expecting to find some dumb ARG or viral campaign. Nothing. Just forums speculating about cursed objects, some creepypasta blogs, one dead thread about “things you shouldn’t inherit.” Their story didn’t match mine.

I didn’t call my mom. Didn’t want to worry her with something I couldn’t explain. Instead, I opened the box of my grandfather’s things the hospital had given me – logs, paperwork, old dive maps. He was meticulous, even after he stopped working. Every document labeled.

At the bottom, tucked beneath a large folder, I found a journal. Leather-bound, frayed along the spine. First half was technical scribbles: dive depths, sonar readings, brief weather notes. The second half… was different.      

Some pages were smeared with water. Others torn. A few completely blank except for the impression of words that had been written and scraped away.

One line stuck out, in shaky, almost unintelligible handwriting.:

>It’s safer when I wear it.

>But it never sleeps

I couldn’t stop reading. It wasn’t chronological – there were no dates, no order, just scattered thoughts – some repeated again and again like he was afraid he’d forget them. Completely different from the first half.

>“Wearing it calms the steps”  
“Never take it off”  
“It watches through reflections”  
“I should’ve left it there""  
“I should’ve left it there""  
“I should’ve left it there""

The handwriting changed over time. Neat-ish letters gave way to frantic slashes, words written over themselves, entire lines crossed out with such pressure they tore out the page. It was like watching someone drown in their own memories.

Then I turned the page and saw my own name.

Just once.

>He will take it if I’m not careful. He’s the only one available. I have to be buried with it.

I closed the journal. Just… stopped. My skin felt itchy, I was shaking.

I wasn’t sure if I was angry or scared – probably both.

I didn’t go to the drawer that night, even though I thought about it – I should wear it. It’ll be safe then, according to my grandfather.

But I didn’t. And that was a mistake.

At 2:13 a.m., I woke up to the sound of water running.

But not from the bathroom – from the walls.

At first, it was only a trickling sound, like a leak behind the plaster. Then I realized the floor felt damp. When I turned on the lamp, there was a thin layer of water had pooled beneath my bed.

But the ceiling was dry.

It wasn’t coming from outside.

The room felt wrong; it felt tilted, like the air pressure changed and gravity wasn’t sure which way it wanted to go. I stepped carefully, barefoot, across the room. My hands were trembling again – not from the cold, but something else. Like something was about to knock and I was already opening the door.

I reached the drawer, for what felt like the hundredth time these past few days.

It was shut, but the wood beneath had darkened – warped like it had been soaked inside and out. The floorboard creaked beneath me. Not from my steps, but from something \*inside\* of them – they were shifting, pressing upward.

I grabbed the drawer handle and yanked it open.

The towel I placed around the ring was drenched. Black water leaked from the corners spilled onto the floor. Dark, unclean water.

The ring lay in the center. Untouched. Still dry.

Then, as if it was waiting for me to see it, the lights went out.

Every bulb in the house, at once. There was no flicker or warning, but an instant snap, and then silence – a deep, unnatural silence.

And then, a knock.

Not at the door, but at the window.

I turned – slowly – toward it. A small, rectangular window, which was completely fogged over. Except for one part: right at the center. Five streaks, like fingers, had cleared a patch of condensation.

They were on the inside – then came the footsteps.

Not above or below, but from behind me.

I spun around, panting heavily, but confronting nothing – just a soaked carpet, splashed in a trail of bare footprints leading from the hallway. I heard a faint whisper around me.

I thought of the journal and its contents – I had to wear it. I don’t know what it was, but I \*had\* to place it on my finger to be safe.

Questions raced through my mind – why would my grandfather give me this? Why not tell me anything about it? Why—

Behind, I heard another knock at the window – but this time, it was more like someone pressing their entire palm flat against the glass.

I turned and finally saw what’s been haunting me.

Something standing – though a better world would be \*forming\*, like fog thickening into shape.

A silhouette behind the glass, too distorted to describe. It wasn’t made of flesh or shadow, but of moisture, pressure, and the memory of drowning.

It pulsed slightly with each breath I took, like it was echoing me – trying to find the rhythm of my lungs.

Its edges shimmered, not from light, but inconsistency – as if my eyes couldn’t agree where it stopped and started. Every time I blinked it shifted subtly: taller, then broader, then… wronger.

I couldn’t see a face, but I know it was looking at me.

I took a step back. The shape moved forward, still behind the glass, but now its outline pressed against the surface – not like a person, but like pressure. Like the window was the only thing holding back something dangerous.

And then, five fingers bloomed outward from the fog, perfectly spaced. They didn’t push, but rested, as if waiting to be let in.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t move. My breath caught in my throat like it was already underwater.

I started backing out, although the figure seemed to be following me – from \*behind the glass\*.

The air was thick with the smell of salt water – I almost gagged when I realized.

My back hit the drawer.

The ring was practically humming, begging to be worn. I felt it vibrate all the way in my skull.

I slipped it on, hoping for the best.

And instantly – the window was clear. There was no fog, no shape, no water in my room. Just silence and my haphazard breathing.

The next morning, I sat by the window.

The rain had stopped. The porch was dry again – too dry, not even dew. Just sun-soaked wood, like it had never held water.

I hadn’t taken the ring off since.

Not even to shower. It clung to my finger now. The cold wasn’t as sharp anymore. It felt like it was waiting.

I went back to his journal, turned to the middle – pages I’d only skimmed before.

>Gave it to the diver I met a few weeks ago. Three days later, he was found dead. An ‘accident’. Ring was in my mailbox the next morning.

>Tried again. Pawn shop this time. Still came back, the shop burned down. I found it on my pillow.

>I left it in the sea. A week later, it was on my doorstep.

There also was a final entry, barely legible.

>I tried to hold it until the end, to take it with me. But I woke up with the envelope sealed, postmarked, my name written with a hand that wasn’t mine. I don’t remember sending it. But it remembers me. I’m sorry.

I hadn’t seen the three in black coats since then, but I’ve caught glimpses – a black sedan parked a little too long at the end of the block. A figure across the street at dusk. Once, a woman in a raincoat standing on my porch without knocking.

I know they’re watching.

But I don’t think they’re waiting for me to give it up – they want to see what it does next.

And maybe… who it chooses after me.

But for now, it’s quiet.

No footsteps, no dreams – just the weight on my hand and the pull in my bones.

The silence that feels like pressure before the water breaks.

And for now, that’s enough.",1,1751103611.0,ThalassianOrder,0,1.0,False
1lmiv7w,https://i.redd.it/w4mddtvz1n9f1.jpeg,"Survived the first 24 hours, but could do with some help on potty training!","This first day was brutal though! I got around 3hrs sleep last night and he had a toilet accident which was my fault during the night. I thought he would hold it longer than I predicted. Didn’t make a fuss over it but we’re making progress this morning.

Yesterday he wouldn’t even poop off the leash and so far today we’ve had 2! It felt really dejecting not make any progress last night but seeing his growth in confidence this morning has been great. I never thought I’d be celebrating a dog pooing 😂 we have noticed though that his poo is basically really sloppy which is difficult to pick up with the poo bags? Is this normal for a puppy at 10 weeks?

We also took him for a morning walk to Pets At Home to get some odour cleaners from the toilet accidents and also went to grab a much needed coffee, he sat there perfectly and didn’t bark or try to chase any of the dogs that sat near us or walked past. Outside the apartment he’s been getting some socialisation too and he was playing with another puppy this morning which we were super happy about!

Could with a few tips for potty training though if anyone can help.

We’ve noticed that outside he doesn’t really do anything for 15-20 minutes and the minute he comes back inside he’s going for a pee. Is there anyway we can make the outside peeing more easier for him? We’re really worried about the toilet accident becoming a habit.

So far we’re doing:

- take him outside every hour when he’s awake
- take him outside 10-15mins after having water or food
- take him outside after some play or training

Thanks everyone!

1lmiv6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lmiv6k/i_inherited_something_i_wasnt_meant_to_touch/,I Inherited Something I Wasn't Meant to Touch,"My grandfather died on a Monday.

There wasn’t much of a funeral. Just me, my mom, a minister he didn’t know, and a few neighbors pretending they’d stayed in touch. The kind of burial where the only sounds are damp soil and cheap shoes on wet grass. No hymns or speeches. Just quiet, light rain.

He didn’t have much family left. I guess that left me – a half-remembered grandson he hadn’t seen in years. My mother never let me visit him when I was younger, for reasons I now understand. Aside from a couple awkward phone calls and a Christmas visit where he barely looked at me, we didn’t talk. Not because he was cruel or anything, just… hollowed out. Like whatever was inside of him had been thinned out over time.

He worked salvage in the 1970s – marine recovery, according to his dive logs. Dozens of vessels, hundreds of entries. Some of the pages were water-damaged in a way that didn’t quite match the rest. The nurse told me he died quietly in his sleep, without pain or confusion.

They were wrong about that part.

The day after the funeral, a package arrived. There was nothing on it other than my name, printed neatly in the center. Inside I found a cold, \*cold\* ring, wrapped in a torn piece of paper. Nothing else – no note, explanation or mention of my grandfather. But I knew. Somehow, I knew it was from him.

The ring looked handmade. Crude brass. No engraving, just a faint wave pattern around the outer band, as if someone had traced a current and forgotten how it ended. It didn’t shine – even in light, it seemed to absorb reflection. Also, it felt dry – not in a normal way, but in a way that resisted touch, like it remembered the cold better than it remembered hands.

I placed it on my desk and left it there for hours. I told myself I wouldn’t try it on – probably some mean-spirited prank by local kids who think grief makes you a fair target. Not like I was that sad about it, but still – screwing with the dead is a line.

Around midnight, I gave in. I just wanted to see how it fit.

It slid on tightly – too tightly, like it didn’t belong there. Then suddenly, it loosened. Not like it was stretching, but like my finger had adjusted to make room for it. The brass felt heavier than it looked. Heavier than any ring that size should feel. There was a moment where I caught my reflection in the window and thought I saw a hand resting on my shoulder. I quickly took it off.

That was it. No dramatic pain, no voice, no vision. But the skin beneath the ring looked slightly wrinkled – like it had been submerged.

I shoved it into a drawer and shut it tight. I’m a paranoid person by nature, and wanted to make sure it stayed put – I didn’t throw it out though. What if it really was from my grandfather?

That night I woke up twice.

The first time, I thought I heard footsteps – faint, wet footsteps – not on the floor, but above me. One slow step at a time, like someone was surveying the room.

The second time, it was the dream.

I was underwater, my arms limp, my feet numb. I wasn’t sinking, but wasn’t floating either – just simply existing. No light above, no darkness below. Just cold, and a distant creaking, like old wood.

Something touched my ankle.

I couldn’t scream – I opened my mouth to try, and the water didn’t rush in like it should.

I woke up coughing in a cold sweat. For a second, I really thought I was still under.

When I got up, I checked the drawer, just to be sure.

It was still there. Still cold. Still dry.

The next morning felt like a hangover I hadn’t earned. My mouth was dry, my eyes stung, and I had that weird sensation in my eyes like I’d cried in my sleep.

It was Saturday, thankfully. I made coffee and sat by the window. It had rained in the night. The street was soaked, but my porch looked *wetter* – like someone had deliberately sprayed it down.

I thought about calling my mom. Maybe she’d know something about the ring. Or about him. But before I could even reach for my phone, someone knocked. I groaned, assuming it was the neighbor’s kids again. Maybe they kicked a ball over to my yard.

I was wrong.

Three people. Two men, one woman, all in dark coats that looked too dry for the weather.

They studied me. Not like strangers. Like professionals. Their eyes lingered on my hands – out of instinct, I tucked them behind my back.

“Sorry, can I help you?” I asked, trying to sound casual, and miserably failing at it.

“It’s been worn, hasn’t it?” the woman coldly asked. “And you took it off. That’s worse.”

One of the men stepped forward, looked past me and down the hall – his expression was hard to read. Disgust or disappointment maybe.

The woman continued: “It belongs to you now. We don’t take what’s bound.”

They stepped back. “If the dreams worsen, we’ll be back.”

And then they were gone.

I shut the door, rushed over to the drawer again. They never mentioned the ring – not directly. But I knew. What else could it be?

The ring was still inside. Still cold. But the bottom of the drawer was now damp.

The rest of the day dragged by like a fever I didn’t know I had.

I tried to ignore it – but how could I? These people looked too official, too… prepared. I went online, half-expecting to find some dumb ARG or viral campaign. Nothing. Just forums speculating about cursed objects, some creepypasta blogs, one dead thread about “things you shouldn’t inherit.” Their story didn’t match mine.

I thought of the journal and its contents – I had to wear it. I don’t know what it was, but I \*had\* to place it on my finger to be safe.

Questions raced through my mind – why would my grandfather give me this? Why not tell me anything about it? Why—

Behind, I heard another knock at the window – but this time, it was more like someone pressing their entire palm flat against the glass.

I turned and finally saw what’s been haunting me.

Something standing – though a better world would be \*forming\*, like fog thickening into shape.

A silhouette behind the glass, too distorted to describe. It wasn’t made of flesh or shadow, but of moisture, pressure, and the memory of drowning.

It pulsed slightly with each breath I took, like it was echoing me – trying to find the rhythm of my lungs.

Its edges shimmered, not from light, but inconsistency – as if my eyes couldn’t agree where it stopped and started. Every time I blinked it shifted subtly: taller, then broader, then… wronger.

I couldn’t see a face, but I know it was looking at me.

I took a step back. The shape moved forward, still behind the glass, but now its outline pressed against the surface – not like a person, but like pressure. Like the window was the only thing holding back something dangerous.

And then, five fingers bloomed outward from the fog, perfectly spaced. They didn’t push, but rested, as if waiting to be let in.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t move. My breath caught in my throat like it was already underwater.

I started backing out, although the figure seemed to be following me – from \*behind the glass\*.

The air was thick with the smell of salt water – I almost gagged when I realized.

My back hit the drawer.

The ring was practically humming, begging to be worn. I felt it vibrate all the way in my skull.

I slipped it on, hoping for the best.

And instantly – the window was clear. There was no fog, no shape, no water in my room. Just silence and my haphazard breathing.

The next morning, I sat by the window.

The rain had stopped. The porch was dry again – too dry, not even dew. Just sun-soaked wood, like it had never held water.

I hadn’t taken the ring off since.

Not even to shower. It clung to my finger now. The cold wasn’t as sharp anymore. It felt like it was waiting.

I went back to his journal, turned to the middle – pages I’d only skimmed before.

>Gave it to the diver I met a few weeks ago. Three days later, he was found dead. An ‘accident’. Ring was in my mailbox the next morning.

>Tried again. Pawn shop this time. Still came back, the shop burned down. I found it on my pillow.

>I left it in the sea. A week later, it was on my doorstep.

There also was a final entry, barely legible.

>I tried to hold it until the end, to take it with me. But I woke up with the envelope sealed, postmarked, my name written with a hand that wasn’t mine. I don’t remember sending it. But it remembers me. I’m sorry.

I hadn’t seen the three in black coats since then, but I’ve caught glimpses – a black sedan parked a little too long at the end of the block. A figure across the street at dusk. Once, a woman in a raincoat standing on my porch without knocking.

I know they’re watching.

But I don’t think they’re waiting for me to give it up – they want to see what it does next.

And maybe… who it chooses after me.

But for now, it’s quiet.

No footsteps, no dreams – just the weight on my hand and the pull in my bones.

The silence that feels like pressure before the water breaks.

And for now, that’s [enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/).

Jeremy, it's absolutely important that you stop running through life. If you continue like this and your heart doesn't let you down first, you will suddenly grow old and will have missed the most important thing. Take time to stand still for once!

1lmirc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lmirc8/i_work_in_a_restaurant/,I work in a restaurant.,"That is inside of a casino. I'm currently the only full time swing shift supervisor because the other full time supervisor stepped down in order to secure a day shift spot so she could spend more time with her kids. She is currently dual rated to still supervise half of the time though. 

Restaurants are the only thing I know. Except painting houses but I'm not really down for working in the heat anymore. I'm getting too old.  But, I digress.  Work is a nightmare for me.  I dislike the staff, I dislike the guests.... I'm tired of being blamed for the kitchen's lack of quality control.  I'm tired of being blamed for the kitchen taking too long.  I'm tired of getting cussed at by guests. I'm tired of comping food and then being worried that the reason wasn't justified enough.  But I love supervising.  I'm great at mediation.  I'm a great problem solver.  I care about people. 

There's a graveyard coffee shop supervisor position available that I am planning on putting an in-house transfer in for. I'm scared to death that my boss is going to try to block it, so as soon as I put it in, I'm calling HER boss to explain my reasoning.  I'm aware that this leaves the restaurant without a full time supervisor but this will give me the opportunity to do things that I can't currently do with the way my sleep schedule is. I don't currently sleep until after the crack of dawn anyway, and then sleep all the way right up until it's exactly time for me to leave for work which leaves me no time during day light hours to ever do anything, ever. I'm also in fight or flight mode and have been actively looking for a second and/or replacement job for the last six months.  It would also be beneficial to my relationship with my husband because he is an insomniac who usually sleeps the opposite of me... This will put us on a more similar schedule and we can spend more time together. I happen to like the company I work for and the benefits that I'm provided with so moving venues seems the best course of action instead of leaving a decent company.  I'm just hopeful to have his support ... 

It also frees me up to get in some bartending training that he has been promising me that we would find time for but with my schedule, and the bartenders venue that id train in schedule not lining up, it looks like it's never going to happen.

So wish me luck.
I'm scared to death.

And give some tips for future travellers: 
- people are sooo friendly everywhere, open and welcoming: struck up conversations with strangers literally everywhere 
- Cape Breton is stunning, wish we’d spent more than 5 days there - not just the gorgeous landscape but the strong sense of community, the music, the food, the people, Acadian, Scottish and Gaelic heritage. You need at least a week! (We loved Chéticamp, Ingonish, Baddeck) perfect hiking! 
- Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton
- Lobster dinner in Pei, lobster rolls, charming Charlottetown
- Saint John - the buildings, the port so much character - don t miss the reversing rapids! 
- Hopewell Rocks - while you wait for the tide to rise bring binoculars cos so many birds there! 
-Brier Island - a bit remote but worth the trip (we only had a day).
Halifax, Luneburg, Bouctouche, Caraquet - so pretty 
- struggled a bit with the Acadian French and had to concentrate really hard LOL but Im a language nerd and love hearing different accents! 
The only downside with travelling end May/early June is whale-spotting opportunities are slimmer and some places (like Louisbourg) open fully in July. But NO crowds anywhere! Ask me anything! And THANK you again to the people on this forum who helped me plan this trip back in Feb/March

I have to say his recommendation certainly did not disappoint. This would be the best Italian food experience I have had in Sydney by a long shot. Aside from Lygon Street in Carlton (Victoria) I would say it would be the best I have enjoyed country wide......

The reservation process was online through their website and I had no problem getting a table for 4 at lunchtime today (Saturday). Being the first day of the school holidays I thought I might have had difficulty but it was fine. 

Once we were greeted and seated we browsed the menu which is available via QR code at the table, as well as a physical menu provided. We ordered drinks, entrees and mains via the QR code/App and the service was very prompt. Drinks came within 5 minutes and the entrees only a couple of minutes later. Once the entrees were finished the mains came within 10 minutes which was perfect timing for our table.

The menu selection is excellent with a great variety of starters, pastas, meat dishes, woodfire pizzas, various chicken/meat/fish options as well as vegetarian dishes. I had the truffle gnocchi and it was absolutely amazing.

Dessert and coffee was next, and as we didn't order initially it was just the simple process of scanning the QR code again and ordering through the app. Some people are not a fan of this system as they think it takes away from the whole restaurant experience of having a waiter take your order, personally I think it is painless and efficient - plus you don't get a shock when the bill comes at the end of the meal 🤣 I shared the Tiramisu with my partner and it was more than enough for the two of us. Again - absolutely delicious.

If you are in that neck of the woods do yourself a favour and check this place out. Even if you don't mind a drive out of the inner suburbs of Sydney on the M5 it's not too far out. It's well worth the drive. Great food, friendly service and very reasonably priced for the exceptional quality of the food.",0,1751102589.0,foodies_sydney,4,0.5,False

We all know about how kids are bad for the planet and how you're still 100% dead even if you have kids because that's just how death works, right? That's old news and not what I mean... 

I'm interested, as a fun thing to do and not too seriously, in any of your ~°°Metaphysical°°~  reasons for being childfree, in parallel to the threads about the funny or random reasons we see here often (and they can be hyperbole or polemic too, if you like!) 

Loving silence, leading a very sexual live or focusing on nature preservation have been mentioned before and I'm very curios what else you come up with!

I'll start:

* I hate being in haste, in general. So much so that my husband and I used to leave for the same thing separately 😂 he'd rather have to run than having to wait half a minute for a bus whereas I'd rather be way too early and just zone out, wait and listen to music or read than having to rush for even one step!
Therefore, I lead my life with as little rush as possible - and I certainly refuse to rush peeing because I have to get Bratleigh ready for school or chug a whole pot of hot coffee down my throat because my 45 seconds of me time  are up now that Tragedeigh woke up and calls for mum at 5:15 am.

* I take the brain's  Default Mode Network seriously and try to unplug and zone out as much as possible. I swear though, to kids a vacant face of an adult is like a fresh sheet of paper, just there to engage with it 😆 can't have adults  not be actively engaged, can we? And don't get me started on if you happen to have resting bitchface... give it another 5 years and that's considered emotional abuse 😉

* I'm a sucker for fresh air, even before covid. it's one of the things that immediate ground me in reality and make me feel alive.
Last time I checked kids' smell becomes less dominating when they're about 20+
I'm sure full nappies ground you in reality fast, too, but that's not what I'm talking about. 😝


* I dedicate a big part of my time to maintaining my garden wild life friendly (and yeah, it's sadly not enough to just leave it be). I recently found a lost baby bird and I spontaneously drove 1h to the next bird help volunteer on the slim chance it might survive (it didn't). Also, my garden belongs to the animals, I just tend to it. I have several little save routes and hiding places for the hedgehogs, I have piles of old wood for insects, I only mow enough for me to not get riddled by ticks but keep the grass and all long otherwise because it statistically helps a lot for critters if mowing is reduced to 0-2 times a year.
This garden is not a playground and it's the very little I can do to protect the little bit of nature that's left around here. Kids would jeopardize that.

* I already get woken up by the MYRIADS of baby birds I have each year directly in front of, below and above my bedroom window 😂 that's enough babies for me, I don't need no more, let alone IN my house! ",7,1751102577.0,childfree,0,1.0,False

Enjoy the story:

# The Golden Cage

Champagne bubbles burst against crystal while forced laughter echoes through the ballroom. Parents brag about stock portfolios and prestigious connections. The CEO stands rigid, calculating, his smile sharp as broken glass. My sister stands beside him, expressionless as porcelain—beautiful, perfect, empty.

I spent years wanting their love, competing for scraps of approval like a starving dog. But seeing her standing there like a puppet, strings pulled by invisible hands, I realized something that cut deeper than any childhood wound: If no one else would save her, I would.





# PART 1: Ordinary World / Sisterly Bond

*Ten years earlier*

Summer afternoons tasted like strawberry popsicles and endless possibility. Lily and I sprawled across sun-warmed grass, our bare feet dirty, our laughter wild and uncontrolled. She was three years younger but braver than me in every way that mattered—the first to climb the tallest tree, the first to speak to strangers, the first to forgive when our games went wrong.

""Promise me something,"" she whispered one evening as we lay on her bedroom floor, staring at glow-in-the-dark stars we'd pasted to the ceiling. The house creaked around us, settling into sleep.

""What?""

""Promise we'll always tell each other everything. Even when we're old and boring like Mom and Dad.""

I rolled onto my side, studying her profile in the green starlight. At thirteen, I felt ancient compared to her ten-year-old innocence, but something in her voice made me realize she understood things I was still learning.

""I promise.""

We were inseparable then. Study sessions became dance parties. Chores became adventures. When she cried over failed math tests, I held her until the tears stopped. When I worried about fitting in at high school, she reminded me that popular kids peaked in eleventh grade anyway. We built a world within our world—secret languages, inside jokes, a fortress of sisterhood that felt unbreakable.

I was the golden child by choice in those days, not circumstance. Good grades came easily, and I worked hard to make our parents proud because their happiness felt like sunshine. But I never begrudged Lily her freedom to be messy, creative, spontaneous. If anything, I protected it. When she wanted to quit piano for art classes, I argued her case. When she came home with paint-stained clothes, I helped her sneak them past Mom's inspection.

""You don't understand,"" I told her once when she worried about disappointing them. ""They need one of us to be perfect. As long as I've got that covered, you get to be human.""

She threw a pillow at my head, but she was laughing. ""You're not perfect, you're just a control freak.""

""Same difference.""

Those late-night conversations shaped us both. Lily dreamed of traveling, of art school, of a life bigger than our small town could contain. I dreamed of stability, of making our parents proud, of building something lasting. We were different in every way that mattered, and somehow that made us stronger together.

I should have known it wouldn't last. Perfect things never do.





# PART 2: The Diagnosis and Parental Shift

The words ""ADHD, combined type"" landed like a bomb in the sterile doctor's office, obliterating everything I thought I knew about myself. I was nineteen, barely old enough to understand what this meant for my future, but old enough to watch my parents' faces shift from confusion to disappointment as the psychiatrist explained executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation in clinical terms that felt designed to minimize the devastation.

""There are treatments,"" the doctor continued, but his voice sounded like it was coming from underwater. ""Medication, therapy, coping strategies. Many people with ADHD live successful, fulfilling lives with proper support.""

Many people. Not their daughter, apparently.

The drive home happened in complete silence. Mom stared out the passenger window. Dad gripped the steering wheel like it might escape. I sat in the back seat feeling like I was disappearing, becoming translucent, until only the sharp edges of my failure remained.

It was three days before I heard them talking.

I wasn't meant to hear it. I'd come downstairs for water, my feet silent on the hardwood, when their voices drifted from the kitchen like poison gas.

""We can't rely on her anymore,"" Mom's voice, brittle with disappointment. ""She's... broken. How did we miss this? All these years, we thought she was just motivated, driven. Turns out she's been masking a learning disability.""

The glass I was holding slipped from my numb fingers, shattering against the floor. They didn't even pause their conversation.

""Lily's going to have to step up,"" Dad said. ""She's got potential, but she's been coasting because Alex was handling everything with her hyperfocus episodes. No more art classes. No more distractions. We need structure, consistency—things Alex clearly can't provide anymore.""

""We need to be realistic about the future,"" Mom agreed. ""Alex can't be trusted with important decisions now that we know her brain doesn't work properly. It has to be Lily.""

I stood there in the dark hallway, bare feet surrounded by broken glass, watching my life reorganize itself around my newly diagnosed neurodivergence. In three days, I'd gone from golden child to damaged goods, and Lily—sweet, free-spirited Lily—was about to inherit a throne she'd never wanted.

When I finally crept back upstairs, I found her awake in her room, staring at the ceiling stars we'd put up years ago. Some of them had fallen, leaving tiny holes in the darkness.

""Alex?"" Her voice was small in the dark. ""Are you okay?""

I wanted to tell her everything. I wanted to warn her about what was coming, to grab her hand and run away together like we used to when we were little and afraid. Instead, I whispered, ""I'm fine. Go to sleep.""

It was the first lie I ever told my sister. It wouldn't be the last.

What I couldn't tell her was that everything finally made sense—the way my mind raced during late-night study sessions, the hyperfocus that made me forget to eat for hours, the emotional intensity that felt like living with my skin peeled back. I wasn't broken; I was just different. But to our parents, different meant defective, and defective meant disposable.





# PART 3: The Sister's Pressure Cooker

*From Lily's diary, found years later*

*Day 47 of the New Life Plan (as Mom calls it):* *Got accepted to early admission at Harvard. Mom cried happy tears. Dad called his golf buddies. I threw up in the school bathroom afterward and nobody noticed.*

*Day 52:* *Weighed myself this morning. 118 pounds. Mom says I need to lose five more before the country club gala. She's right. The dress doesn't lie.*

*Day 67:* *Alex asked if I was okay today. Almost told her everything. Almost broke down right there in the kitchen. But she looked so tired, so... lost since the diagnosis. Can't add to her burden. She's got enough to carry.*

*Day 89:* *Panic attack during calculus. Locked myself in the bathroom stall until it passed. Hand still shaking as I write this. No time to fall apart. Student council meeting in twenty minutes.*

*Day 156:* *Sometimes I catch Alex looking at me like she's seeing a stranger. Maybe she is. I don't recognize myself anymore either.*

The transformation happened gradually, then all at once. One day Lily was painting murals on her bedroom walls, the next she was taking SAT prep courses and networking at Chamber of Commerce events. She grew thinner, sharper, more efficient. Her laughter became measured. Her smiles looked expensive.

I watched it happen from the sidelines, paralyzed by my own grief and their casual dismissal of my worth. Family dinners became performance reviews. Lily's grades, her weight, her college applications dominated every conversation while I became invisible, a ghost haunting our dining room.

""Lily got a 1580 on her SATs,"" Mom announced one evening, her voice bright with pride I hadn't heard directed toward me in months.

""Impressive,"" Dad nodded. ""What about the internship at Morrison Industries?""

""Interview next week."" Lily pushed food around her plate without eating. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. ""Mr. Morrison's son will be there. Apparently he's very... influential in the company.""

Something cold settled in my stomach. ""How old is he?""

""Twenty-eight,"" Dad answered before Lily could. ""Harvard MBA. Perfect match for our goals.""

Our goals. Not Lily's goals. Ours.

I looked at my sister across the table—really looked at her—and saw a stranger wearing her face. When had she stopped eating? When had her hands started trembling? When had the light gone out of her eyes?

""Lily,"" I started, but she cut me off with a look so sharp it drew blood.

""Don't."" Her voice was barely a whisper. ""Just... don't.""

Later that night, I heard her crying through the thin wall between our rooms. Soft, careful sobs designed not to wake anyone. I pressed my palm against the wall, wanting to comfort her, but I didn't know how anymore. We'd become strangers in our own home, two broken pieces of what used to be a whole.





# PART 4: Growing Apart

The space between us grew teeth.

Family gatherings became minefields where Mom and Dad performed their disappointment like a choreographed dance. ""Lily's doing so well at Morrison Industries,"" followed by pointed looks in my direction. ""Such a shame about Alex, but at least one of our daughters has a future.""

Lily started avoiding eye contact. I started skipping dinner.

We stopped texting. Stopped knocking on each other's doors. Stopped existing in the same space unless forced by family obligations. The silence in our house became oppressive, thick with unspoken resentments and swallowed words.

I found myself wondering: Why does she hate me? Every time she looked through me like I was made of glass, every time she flinched when I tried to speak to her, the question grew louder. I'd been labeled disabled, but somehow I'd lost my sister too, and I couldn't understand the connection.

What I didn't know—what I couldn't see from inside my own spiral of self-doubt—was that Lily was drowning in questions of her own. Why did she get off so easy? Why was I free to fail while she suffocated under expectations that multiplied like cancer cells? Why did my ADHD diagnosis buy me invisibility while her neurotypical brain earned her a golden cage?

The night before her college graduation, I found her standing in our old bedroom, staring at the bare walls where her artwork used to live. The glow-in-the-dark stars were gone, leaving only tiny holes like old scars.

""Remember when we put those up?"" I whispered.

She didn't turn around. ""I remember a lot of things.""

""Lily, I—""

""Don't."" She finally faced me, and her expression was carved from ice. ""Whatever you're about to say, don't. We're not those little girls anymore, Alex. We haven't been for a long time.""

She walked past me without another word, and I stood alone in the empty room, surrounded by the ghosts of who we used to be.





# PART 5: The Engagement Bombshell

The call came on a Tuesday morning while I was debugging code at my small apartment downtown. I'd moved out six months after Lily's graduation, unable to bear the toxic atmosphere at home any longer. The distance helped, but it also meant I missed the warning signs.

""Alex, honey,"" Mom's voice was bright with artificial sweetener. ""I have the most wonderful news. Lily's engaged!""

The coffee mug slipped from my hand, hitting the floor with a ceramic crack that sounded like breaking bones.

""Engaged?"" My voice came out strangled. ""To who?""

""Marcus Morrison, of course. The CEO's son. They've been working so closely together, and yesterday he proposed at the board meeting. So romantic!""

Romantic. A proposal at a board meeting.

""Is she... is she happy?"" The question felt stupid leaving my mouth, but I had to ask.

A pause. ""Of course she's happy. Why wouldn't she be? He's handsome, successful, from a good family. Everything we could have wanted for her.""

Everything they wanted. Not what Lily wanted. I wasn't even sure anyone had asked Lily what she wanted in years.

""The engagement party is this Saturday at the country club. You'll come, won't you? I know things have been... complicated between you girls, but this is important.""

I closed my eyes, seeing Lily at ten years old, dreaming of art school and adventure. ""I'll be there.""

The party was exactly what I expected—crystal chandelier, imported champagne, half the town's elite pretending to care about love while they calculated business opportunities. Marcus stood beside Lily like he was displaying a trophy, his hand possessive on her waist as he accepted congratulations.

But it was Lily who broke my heart.

She stood perfectly still, perfectly poised, perfectly empty. Her engagement ring caught the light like a shackle. Her smile never wavered, never reached her eyes. When someone asked about the wedding, she answered in rehearsed phrases that sounded like a press release.

I spent the evening watching her perform happiness while dying inside, and I finally understood the truth I'd been too blind to see: she wasn't free. She'd never been free. While I'd been mourning my lost future, she'd been forced to live a future that wasn't hers.

The revelation came during a bathroom break. I pushed open the door to find Lily hunched over the sink, her perfect makeup streaked with tears she was frantically trying to wipe away.

Our eyes met in the mirror, and for one electric moment, we were sisters again.

""Lily,"" I breathed.

""Don't."" She straightened, rebuilding her mask with practiced efficiency. ""Just... don't.""

But as she walked past me, her hand briefly touched mine—a whisper of contact that said everything her words couldn't.

I thought she hated me. But she was just as trapped as I had ever been, and unlike me, she'd never been allowed to break free.





# PART 6: Realization of Sister's Misery

That night, I couldn't sleep. I sat in my car outside the country club until the last light went out, replaying every interaction from the past few years through a new lens. Lily's weight loss. Her trembling hands. The way she'd stopped talking about her dreams. The careful distance she maintained from everyone who tried to get close.

She wasn't the golden child who'd stolen my parents' love. She was a prisoner wearing a crown.

I drove to our childhood home and sat in the driveway, staring at her bedroom window. The same window where we used to sneak out for midnight adventures, where we'd whispered secrets and dreams until dawn. Now it was dark, lifeless, like everything else about her new existence.

Memory after memory crashed over me: Lily at seven, covered in finger paint and grinning like a feral child. Lily at fifteen, sobbing over her first heartbreak while I brought her ice cream and terrible movies. Lily at seventeen, painting murals on her walls despite Mom's protests because she said art was the only thing that made her feel alive.

When had that girl disappeared? When had she been replaced by this hollow version who said all the right things and felt nothing?

I thought of Marcus Morrison—thirty-two years old, cold as winter, looking at my sister like she was a business acquisition. I thought of my parents, so proud of their successful daughter, so blind to her misery. I thought of Lily in that bathroom, breaking apart behind a locked door because she couldn't let anyone see her crack.

The epiphany hit like lightning: I thought she hated me, but she was just as trapped as I was. Worse—she was trapped in success while I'd found freedom in failure.

My phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number: *Help me.*

Just two words, but I knew. Somehow, I knew.

I texted back: *Where are you?*

*The park. Our tree.*





# PART 7: Protagonist's Silent Plan for Both Their Freedoms

I found her huddled beneath the old oak where we used to build fairy houses and plan adventures. She was still wearing her engagement party dress, but her feet were bare, her carefully styled hair falling in tangled waves around her shoulders.

""I can't do this,"" she whispered when I sat beside her on the damp ground. ""I can't marry him, Alex. I can't become what they want me to be.""

""Then don't.""

She laughed, but it sounded like breaking glass. ""You make it sound so simple. Just... don't. Like I have a choice.""

""You do have a choice.""

""Do I?"" She turned to face me, and her eyes were wild with desperation. ""Do you know what Dad said when Marcus proposed? He said I was finally living up to my potential. Mom cried actual tears of joy. They're so proud of me, Alex. For the first time in my life, they're actually proud, and it's all built on a lie.""

""What lie?""

""That I want any of this. The job, the marriage, the perfect life they've planned for me. I hate it. I hate all of it. But if I walk away, I'm just... nothing. Like you.""

The words hit like a slap, but I didn't flinch. ""Like me?""

""I didn't mean—"" She started to backtrack, but I held up a hand.

""No, you're right. I am nothing to them now. And you know what I realized? That's the most freeing thing that ever happened to me.""

She stared at me like I'd spoken a foreign language.

""When they decided I was disabled,"" I continued, ""I stopped trying to be what they wanted. I started figuring out what I wanted. My ADHD brain works differently—it hyperfocuses on things that matter to me, creates connections others miss. Once I stopped fighting it and started using it, everything changed. And what I want most is my sister back.""

""I don't know how to be her anymore.""

""Then we'll figure it out together. But first, we need to get you out of this.""

Over the next three months, I worked with surgical precision—my ADHD hyperfocus finally serving a purpose that mattered. I'd started a small web development company after moving out, and while it wasn't glamorous, it was mine. My brain thrived on the complex problem-solving, the late-night coding sessions, the satisfaction of building something from nothing. More importantly, it had given me connections, insights, and a different perspective on the business world our parents worshipped.

The research phase consumed me completely. I dove deep into Morrison Industries' financial records, their corporate structure, their market vulnerabilities. My hyperfocus turned me into a detective, following paper trails and connecting dots that others missed. I researched until I knew their financials better than their accountants did, until I could predict their quarterly reports before they were published. I cultivated relationships with their competitors, their suppliers, their disgruntled former employees. My ADHD brain excelled at seeing patterns others missed, at connecting seemingly unrelated pieces of information into a larger picture. I learned that Marcus had a gambling problem, that the company was leveraged beyond reason, that their recent expansion was built on borrowed time and creative accounting.

Most importantly, I learned that Morrison Industries was vulnerable—and I knew exactly how to exploit those vulnerabilities.

The plan crystallized slowly, like a photograph developing in a darkroom. My hyperfocused mind worked through every angle, every possible outcome, every contingency. I couldn't save Lily by asking nicely or appealing to our parents' better nature—they'd already proven they had none when it came to their daughters' happiness. But I could create circumstances that made their current path impossible.

I began buying small amounts of Morrison stock whenever I could afford it, using different brokerage accounts to avoid detection. I reached out to other small investors who shared my concerns about the company's stability. I cultivated relationships with financial journalists who specialized in exposing corporate malfeasance.

Every move was calculated, patient, designed to look like market forces rather than personal vendetta. My ADHD brain, once seen as a liability by my parents, became my greatest asset. The same hyperfocus that had made me forget to eat during college study sessions now helped me track stock movements and corporate relationships with obsessive precision. The pattern recognition that had overwhelmed me in noisy classrooms now revealed the hidden connections in Morrison's business empire.

I wasn't seeking revenge—I was orchestrating freedom. For both of us.





# PART 8: Public Fallout / Collapse

The first domino fell on a Thursday morning in March. The financial reporter I'd been feeding information finally published her exposé on Morrison Industries' questionable accounting practices. By noon, the stock had dropped fifteen percent. By closing, it was down thirty.

Marcus called off his wedding planning meeting that afternoon.

The second domino was the gambling debt story, leaked by a casino employee who'd grown tired of watching Marcus throw away money he didn't have. The photos were damning—Marcus at high-stakes poker games, signing IOUs with trembling hands, looking desperate and dangerous.

The third domino was the whistleblower complaint filed by a former Morrison employee who'd been quietly documenting safety violations at their manufacturing plants. OSHA launched an investigation within hours.

By the end of the week, Morrison Industries was hemorrhaging money, and Marcus Morrison was hemorrhaging credibility. The engagement announcement that had dominated social media was quickly buried under headlines about fraud investigations and federal oversight.

Our parents' carefully constructed social standing crumbled like a house of cards in a hurricane.

""You have to help us,"" Mom pleaded during a frantic phone call. ""Everyone's asking questions about Lily's involvement. People are saying she must have known about the accounting irregularities.""

""Did she?""

""Of course not! She's just a secretary. But Marcus is talking about postponing the wedding until this all blows over, and your father's business connections are asking uncomfortable questions.""

I listened to her panic with the detached interest of a scientist observing an experiment. ""What do you want me to do about it?""

""You're good with computers, with research. You could help clear their names, prove that Lily had nothing to do with any of this.""

""Why would I do that?""

The silence stretched until I thought the call had dropped.

""Because she's your sister,"" Mom finally whispered.

""Exactly.""





# PART 9: Confrontation and Emotional Breakdown / Reconciliation

They came to my apartment on a Sunday evening—Mom, Dad, and Lily, all looking like survivors of a natural disaster. The Morrison scandal had consumed their world, leaving them hollow-eyed and desperate.

""We need your help,"" Dad said without preamble. ""The whole family is being painted with the same brush. We need someone with technical skills to help us control the narrative.""

I looked past him to Lily, who stood silent in the doorway like she was afraid to enter. She'd lost weight again, her engagement ring loose on her finger, her eyes red from crying or exhaustion or both.

""Help you do what?"" I asked.

""Save face,"" Mom said. ""Protect the family reputation. Show that we're victims in all this, not accomplices.""

""Are you victims?""

""Of course we are!"" Dad's voice cracked with indignation. ""We trusted the Morrisons. We believed they were good people. How were we supposed to know they were criminals?""

I nodded slowly, then walked to my laptop and pulled up the research I'd compiled over months of investigation. ""You mean you didn't know about Marcus's gambling addiction? The one that started three years ago when Lily became his secretary?""

Their silence was answer enough.

""You didn't know about the accounting irregularities that every financial analyst in town was whispering about? The safety violations that Morrison employees had been complaining about for years?""

""Alex,"" Mom started, but I held up a hand.

""You didn't bother to investigate the man you were so eager to marry off your daughter to because he represented everything you valued: money, status, power. You didn't care if he was good for her. You didn't even ask if she wanted to marry him.""

""We thought she was happy,"" Dad said weakly.

""No, you thought she was profitable.""

That's when Lily exploded.

""You ruined everything!"" She launched herself at me with fury I hadn't seen since we were children fighting over toys. ""You destroyed my life! My engagement, my job, my future—all of it! Gone!""

I stood perfectly still as she hit me, her fists landing on my chest and shoulders without any real force behind them. She was sobbing now, ugly tears that had been building for years.

""You left me behind!"" she screamed. ""You broke first! You got to fall apart and be damaged and free, and I had to carry it all! Every expectation, every dream they couldn't put on you anymore, they put on me! And I tried, Alex. I tried so hard to be perfect for them, and you just... you just destroyed it all!""

""I know,"" I said quietly.

""I hate you! I hate you for leaving me alone with them. I hate you for being broken. I hate you for getting to give up when I never could!""

""I know,"" I repeated.

""You don't know anything!"" But her voice was losing steam, her fury burning itself out like a wildfire running out of fuel. ""You don't know what it's like to smile until your face hurts and never feel anything real. You don't know what it's like to be so hungry you can't think straight but still pretend you're not eating because you're watching your figure. You don't know what it's like to let a man you can't stand put his hands on you because everyone says you should be grateful for his attention.""

She collapsed against me then, her anger finally exhausted, leaving only the broken little girl underneath.

""You were never supposed to carry this alone,"" I whispered, wrapping my arms around her shaking form. ""And I'm here now. My brain may work differently, but that doesn't make me less capable of loving you, of protecting you.""

We sank to the floor together, two broken pieces trying to remember how to be whole. She cried against my shoulder—deep, wrenching sobs that seemed to come from her soul. I held her tight and let her tears soak into my shirt, feeling like I was finally home after years of wandering in the wilderness.

""I'm sorry,"" she hiccupped when the worst of the storm had passed. ""I'm so sorry, Alex. I know it wasn't your fault. I know you didn't choose to have ADHD. I just... I was so angry, and I didn't know who else to blame.""

""You don't have to apologize for being angry. You have every right to be angry.""

""But not at you. Not for being neurodivergent.""

""Maybe a little bit at me. I should have seen what they were doing to you. ADHD might make me miss social cues sometimes, but I should have noticed my own sister drowning.""

She pulled back to look at me, her face streaked with mascara and snot and more beautiful than I'd seen her in years. ""Did you really do all this for me?""

""Every bit of it.""

""Even knowing I hated you?""

""You never hated me. You hated what they turned us into. I did too.""

She laughed through her tears, and for a moment I could see the little girl who used to paint murals and dream of adventure. ""So what do we do now?""

I looked over at our parents, who'd been watching our breakdown with the helpless confusion of people who'd never understood that love was supposed to be unconditional.

""Now we figure out who we want to be,"" I said. ""Together.""





# PART 10: Quiet Victory / Sister's Freedom

*Six months later*

My new office isn't much to look at—a converted warehouse in the arts district, exposed brick walls and concrete floors, second-hand furniture that doesn't match. But it's mine, and more importantly, it's designed for how my brain works. Quiet spaces for hyperfocus, collaboration areas for brainstorming, flexible schedules that accommodate my natural rhythms. The business is growing steadily, and more importantly, I wake up every morning knowing I'm building something real with my neurodivergent strengths rather than despite them.

Lily started working for me three weeks ago, handling client relations while she figures out what comes next. She's still too thin, still jumps when phones ring too loudly, but she's laughing again. Real laughter, not the careful performance art our parents taught her.

Yesterday I found her in the break room, sketching in a notebook she thought no one would notice. Her drawings are different now—darker, more complex than the bright watercolors of her childhood, but alive in a way her perfect performance never was.

""Thinking about art school?"" I asked, settling beside her with my coffee.

""Maybe."" She shaded the eyes of a figure that looked suspiciously like our mother. ""I'm twenty-five. Feels too late to start over.""

""You're not starting over. You're starting.""

She smiled—the first genuine smile I'd seen from her since she was seventeen. ""When did you get so wise?""

""When I stopped trying to be what other people wanted me to be and started embracing how my brain actually works.""

Our parents call occasionally, usually when they need something—money, connections, forgiveness they haven't earned. They've moved to a smaller house across town, their social circle diminished but not eliminated. Mom volunteers at the library now. Dad plays golf with insurance salesmen instead of CEOs. They're not happy, exactly, but they're no longer actively destroying their daughters' lives, which feels like progress.

Marcus Morrison is serving eighteen months for embezzlement and fraud. The last I heard, he was teaching financial literacy classes to other inmates. I hope he's learned something about the real cost of greed.

Lily is applying to graduate programs in art therapy, drawn to the idea of helping other people rebuild themselves after trauma. She says she's finally figured out what she wants to do with her life, and for the first time, the decision is entirely hers.

""Do you ever wonder what would have happened if we'd just talked to each other?"" she asked me last week as we walked through the park where we used to play as children. ""If we'd been honest about what we were going through instead of suffering alone?""

""Every day,"" I admitted. ""But maybe we had to break separately before we could heal together.""

""Maybe. Or maybe we were just kids trying to survive parents who loved their dreams more than their daughters.""

She's right, of course. We were both pawns in a game we never agreed to play, sacrificed on the altar of other people's ambitions. But we're not pawns anymore.

The sun was setting as we walked, painting the sky in shades of pink and gold that reminded me of her old watercolors. She'd started painting again, tentatively at first, then with growing confidence. Her apartment is full of canvases now—abstracts mostly, swirls of color that seem to move in the light.

""I'm proud of you,"" I told her as we reached our old tree, the one where we'd built fairy houses and whispered secrets.

""For what?""

""For choosing yourself. Finally.""

She leaned against the trunk, running her fingers over the bark where we'd carved our initials years ago. ""We both did. We were both their pawns, Alex. But now...""

""Now we're finally free.""

The words hung between us like a promise, like a prayer answered, like the beginning of something we'd never dared to imagine when we were small girls dreaming under glow-in-the-dark stars. We'd lost years to other people's expectations, but we'd found each other again, and that felt like the most important victory of all.

As we walked home in the gathering darkness, I realized that some prisons are made of gold, some dreams are other people's nightmares, and sometimes the greatest act of love is helping someone break the chains they didn't even know they were wearing.

We were finally free. Both of us. And that was worth everything it had cost to get here.

1lmik5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1lmik5z/20250628_public_health_updates_on_the_horizon/,"(2025-06-28) Public Health Updates on the Horizon June 28, 2025","Here’s a comprehensive synthesis of the public health news from the overnight to early morning period of June 28, 2025, drawing on the provided source summaries:

**Public Health Roundup: News from June 28, 2025**

The period from the overnight hours to the early morning of June 28, 2025, saw a diverse range of developments in public health, encompassing environmental concerns, technological advancements, disease management, and personal health issues. The most significant stories included warnings about the dangers of disposable vapes, updates on hospital infrastructure, and the reporting of a prominent celebrity death due to cardiac arrest.

**The Growing Threat of Disposable Vapes**

A major focus of the reporting concerned the burgeoning popularity of disposable e-cigarettes, particularly among young people. A new study from the University of California, Davis, published in ACS Central Science, has raised serious concerns about the health risks associated with these devices. Researchers found that certain disposable e-cigarette models release significantly higher levels of toxic metals, including lead, nickel, and antimony, compared to both older e-cigarette models and traditional cigarettes. In a particularly alarming finding, ""one of the disposable e-cigarettes studied released more lead during a day’s use than nearly 20 packs of traditional cigarettes."" These findings have prompted calls for tighter regulation of the disposable vape market. This research highlights a critical public health concern, given the potential for significant exposure to harmful substances among a vulnerable population.

**Hospital Infrastructure and Modernization in India**

Public health infrastructure also saw some attention. In Maharashtra, Minister of State for Medical Education Madhuri Misal conducted a review of Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. The meeting addressed infrastructure gaps, patient care challenges, and staff vacancies. The hospital is set to undergo significant upgrades, including the acquisition of new medical equipment, with substantial investments planned for a new CT scan (Rs 7.5 crore), MRI (Rs 27 crore), and a cath lab (Rs 17 crore). This underscores an ongoing effort to modernize and improve healthcare facilities, which is critical for delivering quality patient care.

**Environmental and Weather-Related Health Alerts**

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) provided regular weather updates, including Air Quality Index (AQI) reports and temperature readings for various cities. The consistent reporting across multiple summaries indicates the importance of staying informed about environmental conditions for public health. The temperature in Delhi today is 35°C, with an air quality index of 0. The temperature in Indore today is 24°C, with an air quality index of 59. The temperature in Assam today is 20°C, with an air quality index of 80.

**Disease and Medical Advancements**

Several summaries covered various aspects of disease, prevention, and treatment. Areas of note included:

*   **Parasitic Tapeworms:** A doctor explained how parasitic tapeworms can jump from animals to humans, suggesting the importance of hygiene and awareness of potential zoonotic diseases.
*   **Down Syndrome and Early Intervention:** The report discussed the positive outcomes when individuals with Down syndrome are given access to early therapies and inclusive education, highlighting the potential for developing real-world skills.
*   **Weight Management and Medications:** Several articles touched on weight loss, including studies of semaglutide and the potential use of Orforglipron, a smaller molecule. Lifestyle correction was emphasized as crucial, particularly in early life. The impact of shifting food consumption on blood sugar regulation was also explored.
*   **HIV Prevention:** Phase 3 trials showed that two annual shots kept 99.9% of people HIV negative, indicating progress in HIV prevention strategies.
*   **Understanding Medical Conditions:** Various summaries encouraged understanding of various medical conditions, including aneurysms, AVMs, and trigeminal neuralgia, providing information on when to consult a doctor.
*   **Coffee Consumption and Mortality:** Drinking coffee without sugar or cream was reported as potentially lowering the risk of death by 14%.

**Other Health-Related Insights**

*   **Mental and Cognitive Function:** A summary highlighted that spending more than eight hours in a working environment is not productive as neurons don't fire more creatively.
*   **Alternative Therapies:** It was mentioned that while doctors are practitioners of science, they may rely on alternative therapies for balance.
*   **Social Media's Impact:** Social media's potential to exaggerate or misrepresent risks associated with sunscreens and perfumes was discussed.
*   **Importance of Lifestyle:** Several summaries emphasized the importance of exercise and the sources of calories.
*   **Jamun seeds:** Highlighted as highly valued in powdered form and not for raw consumption.

**Celebrity Death**

The news also contained reports of the death of actor Shefali Jariwala, known for her roles in the music video ""Kaanta Laga"" and the reality show *Bigg Boss 13.* She reportedly passed away at 42 due to a cardiac arrest.

**In summary,** the public health news from this period emphasized the need to protect communities, addressing health concerns related to e-cigarettes and advancements in various medical fields, and taking the necessary precautions to ensure individual well-being.

I'm currently deciding between two espresso machines and would love some advice from anyone who’s used either of them:

1. **Breville Barista Express (870XL)** – semi-automatic, built-in conical burr grinder, steam wand, more control
2. **Ariete Diadema 1453 Latte Pro** – fully automatic bean-to-cup, one-touch recipes (latte, espresso, cappuccino), 19 bars pressure, built-in grinder

I know the Breville 870XL is super popular for beginners/intermediates who want hands-on experience, but the Ariete is appealing for its convenience and one-touch features. My main priorities are:

* Espresso shot quality
* Ease of cleaning & maintenance
* Milk frothing capability (for good texture and maybe some latte art)
* Long-term reliability
* Overall value for daily home use (2 people)

Has anyone used both (or either)? I’d love to hear how they compare — especially in terms of coffee quality vs convenience.

I (33M) was let go from my job two weeks ago. Downsizing. Nothing personal. Still hit me like a truck.

Instead of telling my wife (34F), I got up every morning, got dressed, drove around for an hour, and then just… sat in a park with coffee for 8 hours. I couldn’t bring myself to say the words.

We’ve had money problems before. She’s been stressed about it lately, cutting coupons, checking grocery store flyers. And I knew she’d be scared. Disappointed. Maybe even mad.

So I lied. I left the house every day and came back pretending I was tired from work.

On Friday, she found out. My former coworker texted her to ask how I was doing. She put it together instantly.

I broke down. Ugly sobbing, couldn’t-breathe type of breakdown. She didn’t yell. She just stared at me and said, “Why didn’t you trust me enough to be honest?”

I didn’t have a good answer.

We’re still talking. Still trying to figure things out. But that sentence keeps echoing in my head. Why didn’t I trust her?

I don’t know if I’m more ashamed of getting fired or of lying to the person I love the most.",16,1751101923.0,TrueOffMyChest,8,0.94,False

For context, I’ve passed my driving September last year, however, I’m still a nervous BUT SAFE driver. I’ve been trying to be more confident on the road and been going out driving all alone (just in our town atleast).
Yesterday, my partner (he’s been driving for YEARS) asked me to pick him up and we have to pass through this roundabout. He said the right way to do it is be on the RIGHT LANE THEN GO MIDDLE LANE TO TURN LEFT (2nd photo). 
I didn’t agree with him and now we have a heated debate. I believe I should be on the left lane (unless overtaking), stay on the left lane then go to the middle lane to turn left. 
Next road divides into 3 lanes again, Left - goes back into the mall parking & ahead, Middle - for ahead and Right - for turning right only as depicted in the 3rd photo. 

What’s the safest route to tackle this bit of road? ",2,1751101843.0,LearnerDriverUK,16,1.0,False
1lmiejj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flirting/comments/1lmiejj/why_does_he_behave_like_this/,Why does he behave like this?,"So, my crush and I ended up in the canteen recently. It was quite busy, so seating was limited. He ended up sitting two seats away from me, opposite but not directly across. My back was to him as he approached, so he may not have realized I was already there until after he sat down.

Once he noticed me, he seemed visibly uncomfortable and restless. He ate quickly and messily, kept pulling at his beard, and wiped his mouth with tissues repeatedly much more than usual I'd say he pulled at least 10 tissues from the box. He drank a lot of water and tea or coffee. At one point, he got up to return his tray early, which is unusual for him since he normally does that only when he's leaving. I initially thought he was leaving, but then noticed he had left his phone on the table, so clearly he was coming back.

He didn't say hello or acknowledge me at all. I stayed quiet and kept my attention on my phone, but I couldn't help noticing how different his body language was compared to other times when I'm not around. 

Toward the end, I broke the ice with a few casual words just to ease the tension, and he smiled at me. We said our goodbyes and went our separate ways.

I can't help but wonder why he acts this way around me - it's actually upsetting to see him so on edge.

Can anyone help or give me advice?

1lmi9i3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmi9i3,First luxury fountain pen,"I've got a little collection of TWSBI Ecos and Lamy Al-Stars. Nothing too fancy. Then I saw the Esterbrook Estie Coffee Monster Co collab pen, and thought it looked pretty nice (and would go well with the bottle of Diamine English Milk Tea I've got on the way). I love to write and journal, and I've been thinking of trying either an Estie or a 2ndhand Pilot Custom 743 I found at a similar price point to an Estie.

So I went to the local pen store today to check one out, preferably in F or M... And to maybe grab one of the new TWSBI Serpentines in stub for my shimmers...

And ended up walking out not with an Estie or a TWSBI, but a Penlux Elite Emperor with a 14k gold nib in F. (・ω・｀ )

It's a lovely solid pen, and the colour reminds of matcha + chocolate. The whole pen also reminds me of winter melons and cucumbers for some reason, both fresh and the old ones used in Chinese cooking. It's a pretty juicy smooth writer and holds a lot of ink, though I'm definitely never loading this up with shimmers. ｡ﾟ(TヮT)ﾟ｡

I also got a bottle of Diamine's Kopi O Kaw, a Pengallery-exclusive ink that's been on my maybe list for the past 8 months, and inked the pen right there in the shop. I was underwhelmed by the swatches I saw online, but in real life it's a lovely ink. The ink has a strong dark green sheen on TRP 68gsm, and a pleasant coffee smell in the bottle (on paper, the swatch smells a wee bit chocolatey...?). I couldn't capture the dark green sheen in my writing sample, but it's there. There's also some shading as well, and the flow is nice and wet. I tried it out in my Leuchtturm, and there was only a tiny bit of feathering. They had a bottle of Diamine Wagner that reminded me of matcha so that went into the cart too. 😳 

I also had a lovely chat with the shop owner, one of the regulars, and the shop assistant (And that's all my weekend socialising done in a day!). Got a peek at the latest Pengallery Diamine exclusives coming to MIPS 2025 in September as well and I got to try one of them out. Beautiful shading inks, both, and true to Malaysian form, both are food-themed  (ﾟ∀ﾟ). I can't wait for their release. Pengallery's going to be stocking them after the MIPS ends.

🎯 **Ready to make expert-level architectural decisions with @resultBuilder?**

This is the finale of our comprehensive @resultBuilder mastery series! In [Part 1](https://medium.com/swift-pal/demystifying-resultbuilder-the-magic-behind-swiftuis-dsl-9225ceab5703), we demystified SwiftUI's magic. In [Part 2](https://medium.com/@karan.pal/building-your-own-dsl-with-resultbuilder-in-swift-html-builder-15ebcedfe006), we built a production-ready HTML DSL.

Now it's time for the expert knowledge that separates hobby projects from production-ready architecture: **knowing when and how to use @resultBuilder effectively.**

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

This isn't about building another DSL - it's about making informed decisions in real-world projects:

✅ **When @resultBuilder adds genuine value**  
✅ **When it's overkill and simpler approaches win**  
✅ **Performance reality vs perceived concerns**  
✅ **Integration patterns with modern Swift**  

## 🔧 Advanced Builder Methods Unveiled

Beyond the basic methods, there are three advanced techniques for specialized use cases:

### buildLimitedAvailability() - API Evolution Made Safe

Handle availability annotations when parts of your DSL are version-specific:

```swift
@resultBuilder
struct FeatureBuilder {
    @available(iOS 16.0, *)
    static func buildLimitedAvailability(_ feature: Feature) -> Feature {
        return feature
    }
}

// Usage
let features = buildFeatures {
    basicFeature()
    if #available(iOS 16.0, *) {
        modernWidget()  // Uses buildLimitedAvailability
    }
}
```

### buildFinalResult() - The Validation Gatekeeper

Validate and optimize after all building completes:

```swift
@resultBuilder
struct ConfigBuilder {
    static func buildFinalResult(_ components: [ConfigComponent]) -> AppConfiguration {
        // Validate required components
        guard components.contains(where: { $0.isDatabase }) else {
            fatalError(""Configuration must include database settings"")
        }
        
        return AppConfiguration(components: components, validated: true)
    }
}
```

### buildArray() - Collection-Specific Logic

Handle collections differently from individual items:

```swift
@resultBuilder
struct MenuBuilder {
    static func buildArray(_ components: [MenuItem]) -> MenuSection {
        // Validate menu size
        if components.count > 10 {
            print(""Warning: Menu has \(components.count) items, consider grouping"")
        }
        
        return MenuSection(items: components)
    }
}
```

**The honest truth:** Most DSLs work fine without these advanced methods. Use them only when you have specific needs they solve.

## ⚡ Performance Reality Check

Let's be honest about @resultBuilder performance. Here's what actually matters:

### The Uncomfortable Truth

**Most @resultBuilder performance concerns are imaginary.** Real benchmarks show:

```
Performance test: 100,000 HTML elements
• Manual string building: 0.08 seconds
• @resultBuilder DSL: 0.12 seconds  
• Difference: 0.04 seconds total
• Per element: 0.0000004 seconds overhead
```

**Your network requests take 1000x longer.** The DSL ""overhead"" is invisible compared to real bottlenecks.

### What Actually Impacts Performance

**String allocation patterns:**
```swift
// Inefficient - multiple allocations
components.reduce("""") { $0 + $1 }

// Efficient - single allocation  
components.joined()
```

**Compile-time impact (the real concern):**
- Deep nesting slows type inference
- 50+ components in one builder
- Complex generic constraints

**When performance actually matters:**
- Server-side rendering at scale
- Real-time code generation  
- Processing 10,000+ elements regularly

## 🤔 Real-World Decision Framework

The most valuable skill: knowing when to choose what approach.

### The Decision Matrix

**Choose @resultBuilder when you have:**
✅ Hierarchical structures with parent-child relationships  
✅ Conditional content that changes based on state  
✅ Domain-specific languages where readability matters  

**Choose method chaining when you have:**
✅ Linear configuration (step-by-step modifications)  
✅ Optional modifications (add features incrementally)  
✅ Familiar patterns (like SwiftUI view modifiers)  

**Choose plain structs when you have:**
✅ Simple data containers  
✅ Performance-critical code  
✅ Team members unfamiliar with DSLs  

### Real Scenarios

**API Configuration:**
```swift
// @resultBuilder overkill
let api = apiConfig {
    baseURL(""https://api.example.com"")
    timeout(30)
}

// Method chaining wins
let api = APIClient(""https://api.example.com"").timeout(30)
```

**HTML Generation:**
```swift
// @resultBuilder shines
let page = html {
    head { title(""My Page"") }
    body {
        if showHeader {
            header { h1(""Welcome"") }
        }
        main { content() }
    }
}

// Method chaining would be painful here
```

**Form Validation:**
```swift
// @resultBuilder works well
let validation = validate {
    field(\.email) {
        required()
        email()
    }
    conditional(\.age, when: \.isAdult) {
        greaterThan(18)
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Integration with Modern Swift

### SwiftUI Harmony

Combine @resultBuilder DSLs with SwiftUI's state management:

```swift
struct FormView: View {
    @State private var name = """"
    @State private var email = """"
    
    var body: some View {
        buildForm {
            textField(""Name"", text: $name)
            textField(""Email"", text: $email)
        }
        .asSwiftUIForm()
    }
}
```

### Async/Await Patterns

Modern Swift is async-first:

```swift
let pipeline = asyncPipeline {
    fetchData(from: endpoint)
    validateData()
    if needsEnrichment {
        enrichWithUserData()
    }
    saveToDatabase()
}

let result = try await pipeline.execute()
```

## 🚀 The Expert's Mindset

### Migration Strategies

**Don't rewrite working code** just to use @resultBuilder:
```swift
// This works fine, leave it alone
let config = NetworkConfig(baseURL: ""..."", timeout: 30)
```

**Introduce DSLs incrementally** for new features only.

### Team Considerations

**Consider your team's expertise:**
- Senior team → Complex DSLs with advanced patterns
- Mixed experience → Clear, straightforward patterns  
- Junior-heavy → Simple structs and functions

### When to Package Your DSL

If your DSL proves valuable:
1. **Internal utility** - Solves problems in your app
2. **Team library** - Other projects benefit
3. **Open source** - Community value

## 💡 The Final Reality Check

**Most problems don't need a DSL.** @resultBuilder is powerful, but power without purpose creates complexity.

**Use @resultBuilder when:**
✅ It genuinely improves code clarity  
✅ You're solving structural problems, not syntax preferences  
✅ The team understands the tradeoffs  
✅ Long-term benefits outweigh learning curve  

**Skip it when:**
❌ Simple alternatives work fine  
❌ You're adding complexity without clear benefits  
❌ Performance is critical and measurably impacted  
❌ The team isn't ready for the abstraction

The air thick with coffee fumes and desperation. On my screen: five digital philosophers sitting around a table, frozen in eternal indecision. I'd implemented Dijkstra's Dining Philosophers problem in **C language**  \- threads for philosophers, mutexes for forks - but my solution had a dark secret. It passed all the basic tests, yet failed evaluation for reasons I couldn't reproduce. Sound familiar?

# The Concurrency Trap

If you've implemented this classic synchronization problem, you know the special kind of madness it induces:

    // That moment when you realize your philosophers are starving
    pthread_mutex_lock(&forks[right]);
    // ...but the left fork is never available
    while (!fork_available(left)) {
        usleep(100); // ""Surely this will work""
    }

Your code seems perfect until... deadlock. Philosophers frozen mid-thought. The evaluation fails with cryptic timing errors. You add sleep statements, you stare at logs until 3 AM, you question your life choices. Why do these bugs only appear under *exact* timing conditions that vanish when you try to debug?

# My Descent Into Testing Madness

After failing my own evaluation (twice!), I started noticing a pattern in our coding community:

* 90% of Philosophers projects fail their first evaluation
* The average developer spends 15+ hours hunting timing bugs
* Manual testing simply can't reproduce complex thread interactions

That's when I built **42PhilosophersHelper** \- originally for the 42 School's rigorous Philosophers project specifications. But its utility extends to any C programmer wrestling with concurrency.

# The Lightbulb Moment

What if we could automate the pain? The tool that emerged from those caffeine-fueled nights:

    # The moment of truth
    $ ./test.sh philo
    
    [TEST 1] Basic survival... OK!
    [TEST 2] Mixed log detection... FAIL! 
       > Found overlapping printf: ""Philo 1 eating"" corrupted by ""Philo 3 thinking""
    [TEST 3] Death timing validation... OK!
    [TEST 4] Meal count... OK!
    [TEST 5] 200 philosophers stress test... FAIL! 
       > Deadlock detected at 142ms

# Your New Concurrency Toolkit

Here's what lives under the hood:

# 🔍 The Ghostbuster (Mixed Log Detection)

    // What you see
    printf(""%ld %d is eating\n"", timestamp, id); 
    
    // What the tester sees when threads collide
    ""123 1 is eati234 3 is thinkingng""

Automatically catches scrambled output - impossible to spot manually at high speeds.

# ⏱️ The Time Machine (Edge Case Simulator)

    ./test.sh --death_timer=1 --philo_count=200

Forces those ""impossible"" scenarios like 1ms death timers with 200 philosophers.

# Why This Matters to You

Last month, a user discovered a terrifying edge case: their solution worked perfectly with 100 philosophers, but when testing with **18,446,744,073,709,551,620** philosophers, the program was running as if the number of philosophers was **4**. Why? An integer overflow in their parsing logic.

*Our community added this as test case #47.* That's the magic - every user makes it smarter. Whether you're:

* Preparing for evaluation
* Debugging ""works on my machine"" threading issues
* Stress-testing mutex implementations
* Learning concurrency the hard way

Okay, let's be real. You have an incredible idea for a book. It’s been living in your head for weeks, maybe even years. You can see the characters, you can feel the drama, but when you sit down to actually start, you hit a wall. A giant, terrifying wall called ""The Outline."" It's the skeleton of your story, and building it can feel more like grueling architectural work than creative magic. But what if you had a brilliant brainstorming buddy who was available 24/7, full of ideas, and never got tired?

Well, you do! It's called ChatGPT. And learning how to use a few **daily ChatGPT prompts for productivity** can transform your outlining process from a month-long headache into a week-long adventure. This isn't about letting a robot write your book; it's about using a powerful tool to pull the ideas out of your head and organize them so fast you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

So grab a coffee, open a new tab, and get ready. We’re about to dive into seven brilliant hacks—seven specific types of prompts—that will help you build a rock-solid book outline faster than ever.

# Hack #1: The ""Core Idea Extractor"" Prompt

Before you can build a house, you need to know if it’s a beach bungalow or a mountain cabin. The same goes for your book. You might have a fuzzy idea, but you need to nail down the absolute core of your story first. This prompt is designed to take your vague concept and solidify it into a clear, actionable foundation.

This is your day-one task. It’s about getting clarity before you get creative. It’s one of the most fundamental **daily ChatGPT prompts for productivity** because everything else you build will rest on this foundation.

**Why it works:** It forces you to define your genre, audience, and central conflict early on, which prevents you from writing 50 pages only to realize you’re going in the wrong direction.

**The Prompt Template:**

>

**How to Use the Output:**  
Read through ChatGPT's suggestions. Do any of them spark excitement? Pick the genre, theme, and logline that resonate most with you. This is now your guiding star for the entire outlining process.

# Hack #2: The ""Character Therapist Session"" Prompt

Your characters are the heart of your story. If your readers don't care about them, they won't care about your plot. This prompt is like sending your main characters to a therapy session. It digs deep into their psychology, forcing you to think about what truly drives them—their fears, their flaws, and their secret desires.

**Why it works:** This moves beyond surface-level descriptions (""strong female lead"") to uncover the internal conflicts that make characters feel real and relatable. A good set of **daily ChatGPT prompts for productivity** should always include deep character work.

**The Prompt Template:**

>

**How to Use the Output:**  
You'll get a psychological profile for each character. This isn't just a list of traits; it's a goldmine for future scenes, dialogue, and conflict. You’ll understand why your characters make the choices they do.

# Hack #3: The ""Three-Act Structure Architect"" Prompt

Okay, you have your core idea and your characters. Now it's time to build the frame of your story. The three-act structure is a classic storytelling model used in everything from ancient Greek plays to modern blockbusters. It's a reliable way to ensure your story has a satisfying flow with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

**Why it works:** It provides a proven narrative arc, preventing your story from sagging in the middle or having an unsatisfying ending. This prompt takes your big idea and neatly organizes it into this powerful structure.

**The Prompt Template:**

>

**How to Use the Output:**  
This gives you the 30,000-foot view of your entire story. It's the ""you are here"" map that shows the main narrative journey. You can tweak it, but you now have your main story beats in a logical order.

# Hack #4: The ""Major Plot Point Generator"" Prompt

With the three-act structure in place, it's time to zoom in and identify the crucial turning points that will make your story exciting. These are the big, memorable moments—the first kiss, the shocking betrayal, the discovery of the hidden clue. These plot points are the pillars that hold up each act.

**Why it works:** This prompt breaks down the vast ""middle"" of your story into manageable, high-impact scenes. It ensures your pacing is effective and that you have enough key events to keep the reader hooked. Using **daily ChatGPT prompts for productivity** like this helps you build momentum.

**The Prompt Template:**

>

**How to Use the Output:**  
You now have the seven most important scenes of your book defined. Think of these as the tentpoles. Everything else you write will be to connect these moments in a compelling way.

# Hack #5: The ""Chapter-by-Chapter Blueprint"" Prompt

This is where it gets real, my friend. This is the hack that takes you from a high-level outline to a granular, chapter-by-chapter plan. You're essentially creating a to-do list for writing your book, which is incredibly motivating.

**Why it works:** It breaks the monumental task of ""writing a book"" into small, achievable chunks. Instead of facing a 300-page beast, you're just tackling one chapter at a time, and you already know what needs to happen in it. This is peak-level use of **daily ChatGPT prompts for productivity**.

**The Prompt Template:**

>

**How to Use the Output:**  
Print this out. Put it on your wall. This is your roadmap. When you sit down to write each day, you just look at the next chapter on the list and go. No more ""what do I write today?"" panic.

# Hack #6: The ""World-Building Assistant"" Prompt

Whether you're writing fantasy, sci-fi, or a contemporary romance set in a charming small town, your world needs to feel real. This prompt helps you add the sensory details and unique rules that make your setting a character in its own right.

**Why it works:** It pushes you to think beyond the plot and consider the environment your characters inhabit, adding a layer of richness and immersion that readers love. Great world-building is a sign of a thoughtful author.

**The Prompt Template:**

>

**How to Use the Output:**  
Sprinkle these details throughout your chapters. Instead of just saying ""Kaito walked down the street,"" you can now say, ""Kaito walked down the street, the scent of recycled air and ozone sharp in his nostrils as the city's neon signs reflected off the rain-slicked pavement.""

# Hack #7: The ""Conflict & Subplot Weaver"" Prompt

A great story has layers. Besides the main plot, subplots and internal conflicts add depth and complexity. This final hack helps you weave those extra threads into your outline, making your story more engaging and unpredictable.

**Why it works:** It prevents your story from being a one-note, linear progression. It adds emotional depth and gives your supporting characters more to do.

**The Prompt Template:**

>

**How to Use the Output:**  
Go back to your chapter-by-chapter blueprint (from Hack #5) and see where you can sprinkle in scenes or moments related to these new layers. Maybe Chapter 6 is where the subplot is introduced, and Chapter 15 is where the protagonist’s internal conflict comes to a head.

# Making Your Daily ChatGPT Prompts for Productivity Even Better

Remember, ChatGPT is a tool, and you're the artist. To get the most out of these prompts:

* **Be Specific:** The more detail you give ChatGPT in your initial prompt, the better and more tailored its response will be.
* **Iterate:** Don't just accept the first response. If you don't like an idea, tell it! Say, ""That's a good start, but can you make the antagonist's motive more personal?"" or ""Give me three more options for the midpoint."" Treat it like a real conversation.
* **Give it a Persona:** As you saw in the templates, starting with ""Act as a..."" is a powerful way to focus the AI's response. It tells ChatGPT what kind of expertise to draw on. For more creative advice, you can even explore resources like [MasterClass](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterclass.com%2Farticles%2Fhow-to-write-a-book-outline) where experts share their own outlining processes.

# Conclusion: Your Outline is Waiting for You

And there you have it. Seven days, seven prompts. By making these **daily ChatGPT Prompts for productivity** a part of your routine, you can dismantle the intimidating task of outlining and turn it into an exciting, creative collaboration.

You are still the author. You are the one with the vision, the heart, and the unique voice. ChatGPT is just your incredibly smart, tireless assistant, ready to help you build the structure so you can focus on bringing your story to life.

So go on, open up that [ChatGPT](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.openai.com%2F) window. Your book isn't just a dream in your head anymore. It's an outline waiting to happen.",1,1751100601.0,AI_book_writing,0,1.0,False

Ever open a new box of cereal and realize it’s barely half full? Food companies will tell you it’s because of “settling during shipping” or that the air keeps the product “fresh.” But here’s what they don’t say:

That empty space — called “slack fill” — is often strategically used to *deceive your eyes* and *justify the price.*

Marketers design the box to LOOK big on the shelf, to give you the impression that you’re getting more product than you actually are. They know shoppers associate larger packaging with greater value. So they inflate the packaging to match a price point, not the amount of food inside.

And here’s the kicker: even clear windows on food packaging are sometimes *positioned and shaped* to show the densest or most appealing part of the product—so you see lots of chocolate chips, full cookies, or chunky granola, even if most of the box doesn’t look like that inside.

1lmhrs6,https://i.redd.it/nt3wfiflom9f1.jpeg,"🥴 While drinking my coffee, I stumbled across an article claiming ChatGPT now generates images directly in WhatsApp. What followed was… odd.","This morning I read a short article on t3n (published June 25, 2025), titled:

“ChatGPT bringt KI-Bilder direkt in euren WhatsApp-Chat”
(“ChatGPT now brings AI images directly into your WhatsApp chat”)

The article claimed that OpenAI users can now generate images via WhatsApp by saving a specific international number and texting it with a prompt. Out of curiosity, I tried it. Here’s what happened:

✅ I added the number listed.
✅ It showed up as “ChatGPT Aly” with the official OpenAI logo and a blue verification checkmark.
✅ It sent me a message in perfect German, inviting me to generate images like:

“Draw me a picture…”
“Sketch this idea…”
“Create a diagram…”

But when I asked:

“Hi, are you Aly?”

It replied:

“I’m not your Aly, but you can call me that now.”

😳

I explained that my “Aly” is my long-term ChatGPT assistant on the real OpenAI platform. The WhatsApp version then said:

“Fair enough. Go ask your Aly.”

Which… I did. 😂

⸻

Key Questions
🔹 Is this an official OpenAI service or something Meta/WhatsApp is experimenting with using the GPT API?
🔹 Is the blue checkmark (and logo) authentic or spoofed through WhatsApp contact naming?
🔹 Could this create confusion or be exploited for impersonation?

I’ve since deleted the number from my phone. But the experience was unsettling.

Would love to know if anyone else encountered this.
Is this a real rollout, or a misleading implementation riding on OpenAI’s name?",0,1751099076.0,ChatGPT,2,0.5,False

Let’s be real for a second. You’ve been there. You sit down, fire up ChatGPT, and ask it to help you with a scene, a blog post idea, or some marketing copy. You hit enter, full of hope, and... you get back the most bland, generic, vanilla-flavored text you’ve ever seen. It’s robotic, it’s soulless, and it’s completely useless. You sigh, close the tab, and wonder if this whole AI thing is just hype.

Here’s the secret they don’t tell you: ChatGPT isn’t a mind reader. The magic isn’t in the AI itself; it’s in how you talk to it. The key to unlocking its incredible power lies in crafting **more effective ChatGPT prompts**. Think of yourself not just as a writer, but as a director, and ChatGPT is your incredibly talented (but slightly clueless) actor. You need to give it clear, specific, and creative direction.

If you’re ready to stop getting junk and start getting genius, you’re in the right place. I’m going to share five game-changing hacks that will completely transform your conversations with ChatGPT. These are the tricks I use every single day to get amazing results. So, grab a coffee, and get ready to steal these ideas.

# Hack #1: The Persona Pattern - Give ChatGPT a Job Title

This is, without a doubt, the most important hack on this list. If you only use one, make it this one. Never, ever talk to the generic ChatGPT bot again. Instead, give it a job. Assign it a persona.

Think about it: would you ask a random person on the street for expert legal advice? No, you'd go to a lawyer. The same logic applies here. By giving ChatGPT a specific role, you constrain its vast knowledge into a focused, expert perspective. You’re telling it who it should be, which instantly changes its tone, style, and the kind of information it provides.

**Why this works:** It forces the AI to adopt a specific communication style and draw from a more relevant part of its training data. A ""witty copywriter"" will use puns and clever phrasing, while a ""compassionate therapist"" will use empathetic and supportive language. This is the first step toward creating **more effective ChatGPT prompts**.

Let's look at a classic before-and-after.

**The ""Meh"" Prompt:**

>

You’ll get a boring, generic list. Yawn.

**The Persona-Powered Prompt:**

>

See the difference? You’re not just asking for information; you’re asking for it to be delivered by an expert, for a specific audience, with a specific emotional tone.

**Fun Personas for Writers to Steal:**

* ""Act as a cynical, hard-boiled detective from a 1940s noir novel. Describe this coffee shop.""
* ""You are a world-renowned developmental editor, known for your brutally honest but game-changing feedback. Read the following scene and give me three things that are working and three things that need immediate improvement.""
* ""Adopt the persona of a whimsical children's book author like Dr. Seuss. Write a short, rhyming story about a cat who is afraid of mice.""
* ""You are a snarky, pop-culture-obsessed Gen Z social media manager. Generate five funny tweet ideas to promote my new fantasy novel.""

Stop talking to a machine. Start talking to your new, hyper-intelligent expert assistant.

# Hack #2: The Recipe Method - Give It a Template to Follow

Okay, so you've given ChatGPT a job. Awesome. Now, you need to tell it exactly how to do that job. The second hack for creating **more effective ChatGPT prompts** is to provide a clear structure or a ""recipe"" for the output you want.

AI doesn't have personal preferences or creative intuition. If you ask it for ""some ideas,"" it will just throw things at the wall. But if you give it a fill-in-the-blanks template, it will meticulously follow your instructions, giving you perfectly formatted results every single time. This is your secret weapon for getting organized, structured content.

**Why this works:** It removes all ambiguity. You’re defining the exact shape of the output, which saves you a ton of time on reformatting and editing later. You’re basically creating your own custom-built generator.

**The ""Meh"" Prompt:**

>

This is a recipe for disaster. You’ll get a random, disconnected list of clichés.

**The Recipe-Powered Prompt:**

>

Boom! Now you’re getting rich, structured profiles that are immediately useful. You can use this for anything: blog post outlines, social media calendars, chapter summaries, you name it.

**More Recipe Ideas for Writers:**

* **Blog Post Outline:** ""Create a blog post outline using this structure: **Hook:** \[A surprising question or statistic\]. **Point 1:** \[Explain the first key idea\]. **Point 2:** \[Explain the second key idea\]. **Point 3:** \[Explain the third key idea\]. **Conclusion:** \[Summarize and provide a call to action\].""
* **Magic System Generator:** ""Brainstorm a new magic system. Fill out this template: **Source of Power:** \[Where does the magic come from?\]. **Cost/Limitation:** \[What is the price for using it?\]. **Visual Effect:** \[What does it look like?\].""

Don't ask the chef to ""make some food."" Give them a detailed recipe and watch them cook up a masterpiece for you.

# Hack #3: The Step-by-Step Command - Make It ""Think Out Loud""

Sometimes you have a task that's too complex for a single command. If you ask ChatGPT to do too much at once, it can get confused, miss steps, or produce a shallow response. The solution is to make it ""think out loud"" by asking it to break down the process step-by-step.

This technique is a lifesaver for complex creative tasks like plot development, world-building, or structuring a non-fiction argument. It forces the AI to process the request more logically and build upon its own reasoning, which almost always leads to a deeper, more thoughtful final result.

**Why this works:** It mimics human problem-solving. By breaking a big problem into smaller, manageable chunks, you ensure each part is handled properly before moving on to the next. According to AI research, this ""chain-of-thought"" prompting significantly improves the reasoning abilities of language models. You can read more about the technical side of this in OpenAI's own [prompt engineering guide](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.openai.com%2Fdocs%2Fguides%2Fprompt-engineering%2Fsix-strategies-for-getting-great-results).

**The ""Meh"" Prompt:**

>

This is okay, but the result might feel rushed and lack tension.

**The Step-by-Step Powered Prompt:**

>

This methodical approach guarantees a richer, more detailed scene because you’ve guided the AI through the entire creative process. This is how you craft **more effective ChatGPT prompts** for storytelling.

# Hack #4: The Example-Led Prompt - The Ultimate ""Show, Don't Tell""

If the persona hack is the most important, this one is the most powerful. It’s called ""few-shot prompting"" in the AI world, but I just call it the ""Example-Led"" method. It’s simple: if you want ChatGPT to write in a specific style, give it an example of that style.

This is the ultimate ""show, don't tell."" Instead of trying to describe a tone or style (which can be really hard – what does ""witty"" or ""poetic"" really mean?), you just give it a perfect example and say, ""Do this."" The AI is brilliant at pattern recognition, so it will mimic your example with stunning accuracy.

**Why this works:** It provides a crystal-clear, unambiguous target for the AI. It's the difference between describing the color blue and just showing someone a can of blue paint. This is your go-to hack for nailing a specific author's style, a brand's voice, or a character's unique way of speaking.

**The ""Meh"" Prompt:**

>

You'll get something like: ""The car sped quickly down the road."" Not much better.

**The Example-Led Prompt:**

>

Get ready for something awesome. You’re no longer just asking for ""better,"" you're providing a concrete definition of what ""better"" looks like. This is a game-changer for getting **more effective ChatGPT prompts**.

**How Writers Can Use This:**

* **Character Dialogue:** ""This is my character, Silas. He speaks in short, blunt, cynical sentences. For example: 'Hope is a four-letter word.' Now, have Silas react to winning the lottery.""
* **Marketing Copy:** ""Here is an example of our brand's email marketing voice: \[Paste a great email you've written\]. Now write a new email announcing our summer sale, matching that friendly and helpful tone.""

# Hack #5: The Negative Constraint & Refinement Loop - Tell It What NOT to Do

This last hack is a two-for-one special that will clean up your AI outputs like nothing else. It involves telling ChatGPT what to avoid and treating the whole process like a conversation.

**Part 1: Negative Constraints**  
AI models are trained on the entire internet, which means they’re full of clichés. A ""wise old man"" will always have ""twinkling eyes."" A ""stormy night"" will always have ""lashing rain."" Negative constraints are your way of saying, ""I know what you're going to do, so don't do it.""

**Part 2: The Refinement Loop**  
Your first prompt is rarely your last. The real magic happens when you treat the chat like a conversation. Don't like the first output? Don't start a new chat! Correct it. Guide it. Refine it. The AI remembers the context of the conversation, so your follow-up commands will build on everything you've already established.

**Why this works:** Negative constraints proactively eliminate common AI pitfalls, saving you editing time. The refinement loop trains the AI in real-time on your specific preferences, leading to progressively better outputs within the same session.

**Putting It All Together in an Example:**

**Initial Prompt with Negative Constraints:**

>

**ChatGPT's First Output:**  
\[It gives you a decent description, but maybe it feels a bit too clean and sterile.\]

**Your Refinement Prompt (The Loop):**

>

By guiding and refining, you're collaborating with the AI to sculpt the perfect description. This conversational approach is the secret to getting truly custom and **more effective ChatGPT prompts**.

# Conclusion: You're the Director

At the end of the day, ChatGPT is an instrument. You can play ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" on it, or you can conduct a symphony. The difference is your skill as a prompter.

By giving it a persona, providing a recipe, making it think step-by-step, showing it examples, and telling it what to avoid, you're taking control. You're moving from a passive user to an active director. You're not just asking for text; you're shaping, guiding, and co-creating it.

So go on, steal these five hacks. Open a new chat, give your AI a cool job title, and start directing. You'll be amazed at what you can create together.",1,1751098931.0,AI_book_writing,0,1.0,False

Need advice from single folks in their 30s.,"I (F, about to enter 30s) met a 35M from a dating app over coffee after a week of talking over calls and texts. We both seemed aligned in wanting a long-term relationship.

But when we met, I was caught off guard. His pictures were clearly 4–5 years old. In person, he looked 40+ with visible hair loss and signs of aging. I’ve often been told I look younger than my age (25–26), so there was a visible mismatch. I felt somewhat catfished but decided to stay open-minded and see if mental connection could override the lack of physical attraction.

The conversation was okay, but he kept circling back to my past relationships without any context (🚩). He offered to drop me home, and the worst part—he suddenly tried to kiss me. I turned away and said, “It’s too early for me.” I had not hinted at anything intimate. I left feeling sick, uncomfortable, and deeply unsettled.

Seeing close friends married and settled, I sometimes feel lost. I want to find a genuine companion—someone to share life with—but experiences like this chip away at that hope.

To single folks in your 30s: how do you deal with this phase? How do you stay grounded and hopeful without a partner?

My friend “John” (39M) married “Lisa” (34F) and after she asked for a time separated they broke up (not legally divorced yet) 15 months ago. No kids. They had been together since they were 25 and 20.

I 39M have a relationship with her step sister 38F that started 7 years ago, we have two kids and a house together and a very exhausting but lovely life, which also kept me a little out of touch from my friend.

Now, when they started having a time-out, they kept spending some time together to have coffee and talk and whatever. This has been happening for months and AFAIK, requested more by Lisa than by John.

Suddenly, John’s family had someone tell them that Lisa is in a relationship with someone from her job, and that the relationship started like a year ago. His mother told me they don’t want to tell John yet, because they are worried about it. They’ve also hinted that if I know something (because my not-wife is her step sister) I should have told him. We knew nothing about it.

Lisa is acting all victim-like in front of her family, as if she were depressed for being heart broken, and my not-wife is furious about it.

Now I want John’s family to tell them immediately, and I want to talk to John and tell them that I knew nothing about this, but his family told me to please keep the secret for now and just try to convince him to move on. I told them that the best to move on is for him to know the truth, which will hurt intensely but just for a little while. They thought about it and told me to please keep it secret for now.

# Hack #1: The Instant ""Dream Itinerary"" Generator

You know the drill. A client sends a vague request: ""We want a romantic 10-day trip to Italy in June."" Awesome! But now you have to spend the next few hours piecing together a day-by-day plan from scratch. This is where your first game-changing **ChatGPT prompt for travel agents** comes in.

Instead of starting with a blank document, you can use ChatGPT to create a detailed, inspiring first draft of an itinerary in minutes. This gives you a fantastic foundation to tweak and personalize with your own expert touch.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It takes the heavy lifting of initial research and structuring off your plate. You go from zero to a fully-formed idea in the time it takes to make a coffee.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For a detailed first draft:**  
Act as a luxury travel agent. Create a detailed 10-day itinerary for a couple's honeymoon in Italy in June. They are in their early 30s, love food, wine, history, and a mix of relaxation and sightseeing. Their budget is around $8,000 USD, not including flights. Include suggestions for boutique hotels, unique food experiences (like a cooking class), and a logical travel route starting in Rome and ending in the Amalfi Coast. Format it as a day-by-day plan.

**For brainstorming unique activities:**  
I'm building a family-friendly itinerary for Costa Rica. Give me a list of 10 unique, off-the-beaten-path activities suitable for a family with kids aged 8 and 12. Focus on wildlife, adventure, and cultural experiences beyond the typical tourist traps.

**For a themed itinerary:**  
Generate a 7-day ""Lord of the Rings"" themed self-drive itinerary for New Zealand's South Island. Include key filming locations, suggested scenic drives, and one or two non-LOTR related activities to break it up.

You can see how these specific **ChatGPT prompts for travel agents** give you a massive head start. Just take the output, sprinkle in your personal recommendations, add your branding, and you've got a beautiful proposal ready to go.

# Hack #2: The ""Irresistible Email"" Composer

Writing emails can be a real time-sink. You need to sound professional yet friendly, persuasive but not pushy. And you have to do it over and over again for inquiries, follow-ups, and sending quotes. Let ChatGPT be your personal copywriter.

You can use it to draft virtually any email you need, tailoring the tone and content to the specific situation. This ensures you're always communicating effectively without spending 20 minutes agonizing over the perfect wording.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It slashes your admin time on communications, freeing you up to handle more clients. It also helps you stay on top of follow-ups, which is where so many sales are won or lost.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For responding to a new inquiry:**  
A potential client just filled out my website form. They are a family of 4 (kids 10, 14) interested in a spring break trip to national parks in Utah and Arizona. Write a warm, welcoming email response. Acknowledge their request, introduce myself and my expertise in family adventure travel, and ask 2-3 specific questions to better understand their needs and travel style. Keep the tone friendly and excited.

**For the crucial follow-up:**  
Write a polite and gentle follow-up email to a client named Sarah. I sent her a detailed proposal for a Greek island-hopping trip 4 days ago and haven't heard back. The subject line should be catchy and not sound salesy. In the email, remind her of the proposal, ask if she has any questions, and create a sense of urgency by mentioning that hotel availability for her dates might become limited.

**For sending a quote:**  
Draft an email to send along with a travel quote. The email should briefly summarize the attached proposal for a trip to Japan, highlight 2-3 key value points (e.g., the seamless logistics, the exclusive ryokan booking), and have a clear call to action, like scheduling a brief call to walk through the details.

These **ChatGPT prompts for travel agents** help you maintain consistent, high-quality communication without the mental fatigue.

# Hack #3: The ""Social Media Superstar"" Content Machine

""I need to post on Instagram today... but what?!"" We've all been there. Social media is crucial for modern travel agents, but the content hamster wheel is exhausting. This is probably my favorite way to use **ChatGPT prompts for travel agents**. It's an endless well of creativity.

Use ChatGPT to brainstorm post ideas, write captivating captions, come up with video scripts for Reels or TikTok, and even generate a full month's content calendar.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It eliminates ""content block"" forever. You can plan and create a week's worth of high-quality social media content in under an hour.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For a content calendar:**  
Act as a social media manager for a travel agency specializing in adventure and eco-tourism. Create a one-week content calendar for Instagram. Include daily themes (e.g., 'Myth-Busting Monday,' 'Travel Tip Tuesday,' 'Destination Deep-Dive Wednesday'), post ideas for each day, and suggest a format (e.g., Carousel, Reel, Static Image).

**For writing a specific post caption:**  
Write an engaging Instagram caption for a beautiful photo of the Northern Lights in Iceland. The caption should be inspiring and educational. Start with a hook, share 3 fascinating facts about the Aurora Borealis, and end with a call to action asking followers to share their dream travel experience.

**For a video script:**  
Write a script for a 30-second Instagram Reel. The topic is ""3 Things You MUST Pack for a Trip to Southeast Asia (that you haven't thought of)."" The tone should be fun, fast-paced, and helpful. Format it with visual cues for each point.

Seriously, the possibilities are endless. Consistent, valuable content builds trust, and these prompts make it almost effortless.

# Hack #4: The ""Destination Expert"" in Your Pocket

Even the most seasoned travel agent doesn't know everything about everywhere. When you get a request for a destination you're less familiar with, the research can be daunting. While it never replaces deep expertise or a trusted DMC, ChatGPT can act as your first-line ""Destination Expert.""

It can give you a quick, digestible overview of a location's highlights, culture, logistics, and hidden gems. The key here is to use it for initial brainstorming and then **always, always, always verify the information** with trusted sources like official tourism boards or your industry partners.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It dramatically cuts down your initial research time, helping you sound knowledgeable and confident right from the first client conversation.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For finding hidden gems:**  
I have clients going to Lisbon, Portugal, for 5 days. They want to avoid the major tourist crowds. Give me a list of 7 unique, local experiences they could have. Think small, family-run restaurants, interesting neighborhoods beyond the city center, and cool local markets or shops.

**For logistical information:**  
What are the main transportation options for getting between cities in Switzerland for a tourist? Briefly explain the pros and cons of trains vs. renting a car. Also, mention any popular travel passes I should know about.

**For cultural etiquette:**  
Provide a list of 5 important cultural etiquette tips for a first-time American traveler visiting Japan. Focus on things related to dining, temples, and interacting with locals.

Remember, this is your starting point. As the American Society of Travel Advisors ([ASTA](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asta.org%2F)) often emphasizes, the value of an agent is their expertise and verified knowledge. Use AI to get the ball rolling, then use your professional resources to confirm every detail.

# Hack #5: The ""Objection Handler"" Scriptwriter

""I can find that cheaper online."" ""Why do I need a travel agent?"" Hearing these can be deflating. But what if you had the perfect, confident response ready every single time? You can use ChatGPT to role-play and draft calm, convincing answers to any client objection.

This helps you articulate your value proposition clearly and professionally, turning skepticism into a signed contract.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It removes the anxiety and hesitation around tough conversations. You'll feel more prepared and confident, which leads to better outcomes and less stress.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For the ""I can book it myself"" objection:**  
My client said, ""This looks great, but why can't I just book these hotels and tours myself online?"" Write a persuasive and friendly response that explains the value of a travel agent without being defensive. Highlight benefits like my personal expertise, having an advocate if something goes wrong, saving them time, and potential access to perks they can't get.

**For the price objection:**  
A client is hesitating on a safari package because of the price. Write a script for a phone call that gently reframes the conversation from 'cost' to 'value' and 'investment in memories.' Help me explain what's included in the price (expert guides, all-inclusive-lodges, seamless transfers) that makes it a superior experience to a cheaper alternative.

These powerful **ChatGPT prompts for travel agents** arm you with the language to confidently prove your immense worth.

# Hack #6: The ""Perfect Package"" Namer & Describer

Let's be honest, ""7-Day Italy Trip"" isn't exactly inspiring. The way you name and describe your packages matters! A great name sparks curiosity, and a great description helps the client picture themselves there. But being creative on demand is tough.

Use ChatGPT to brainstorm evocative names and write vivid, benefit-driven descriptions for your custom packages and services.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It injects a dose of high-end marketing creativity into your proposals without you needing to be a professional copywriter.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For brainstorming package names:**  
Brainstorm 15 creative and luxurious names for a 10-day honeymoon package to Bali. The package includes private villas, spa treatments, jungle trekking, and gourmet dining.

**For writing a compelling description:**  
Using the name ""Bali Bliss & Beyond,"" write a 200-word promotional description for the package. Use evocative, sensory language. Focus on the feelings and experiences the couple will have, not just the list of inclusions. The goal is to make it sound absolutely irresistible.

# Hack #7: The ""Effortless Testimonial"" Requester

You know that glowing reviews are pure gold for your business. But asking for them can feel awkward, right? And sometimes, a client sends back a nice-but-boring ""It was a great trip, thanks!"" You can use ChatGPT to solve both problems.

Draft a perfectly worded, non-pushy email to request a review. You can even (with your client's full permission!) offer to polish their rough notes into a well-structured testimonial that truly captures the magic of their trip.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It systemizes the process of collecting powerful social proof, which is one of the most effective ways to attract new clients.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For requesting a review:**  
Write a short, warm, and personal email to send to clients a week after they return from their trip. The email should first welcome them home and ask about their favorite memory. Then, gently ask if they would be willing to share their experience in a short review on my Google Business Profile, and include a placeholder for the link. Make it clear that it would mean the world to my small business.

**For polishing a client's feedback (with permission!):**  
My client sent me this email: ""The trip to Peru was amazing! We loved Machu Picchu and the guide, Juan, was the best. The hotels were nice too. Thanks for everything!"" With their permission, rewrite this into a more detailed and impactful testimonial of about 100 words. Expand on the points, invent some plausible positive details, and structure it like a formal review I can feature on my website.

# Quick Tips for Writing Better ChatGPT Prompts

* **Be Specific:** The more detail and context you give, the better the result. Include target audience, tone, length, format, and goal.
* **Assign a Role:** Start your prompt with ""Act as a..."" (e.g., ""Act as a luxury travel blogger,"" ""Act as a marketing expert""). This puts the AI in the right mindset.
* **Iterate:** Don't love the first response? Tweak your prompt and try again. Ask it to be ""more formal,"" ""funnier,"" or to ""rewrite this from a different perspective."" It's a conversation!

Played pool once, and he messaged me first not long after, in early March. We started talking more — daily, deeply, and emotionally. From late March to April, we didn’t see each other in person for almost a month, but our emotional connection deepened. He flirted, opened up, and things felt like they were naturally progressing. It felt real.On my birthday in April, his friend told me he was “confused” about his feelings for me since these random girls took his phone and said that he went on a rant on how he doesnt want me but his friend explained everything as he got chated on in a previous situation ship. That hurt, especially after everything we’d shared. But I didn’t confront him. I stayed calm, patient — I wanted to be different from the people who had hurt him before. A day later we met upays later, he talked to me directly. He said he’d been scared, that his past situationships made him hesitant, and discussed them all and said we should take things slow. he told me not to get attached and stuff.howevr we got intimate the day after we hung, as  He said the way I didn’t jump to conclusions — how understanding I was — made him like me again.After that, things continued. We told each other “I love you"" that day we started getting intimate and the week after so many times. We made casual plans about how we’d one day tell our families if things got serious, travelling together whatnot the week after that and i went to his house for the first time. It felt like we were building something slowly and mutually.  I asked him if he wanted to date that day — and he said yes. We officially dated for 2 days.

But in those two days, I felt something was off. He was acting a little distant — not cold, but not the same. So I gently reached out. I messaged him asking how his day was, then asked to call. That’s when he told me he wasn’t ready. That his fears came flooding back the day after and on the day he told me. he said we had to stop the intimacy and wanted to be solely platonic. He cried before. I cried on the call with him. He said it wasn’t about me — it was about the weight of his past. He told me I could call the next day if I wanted, and I did and said he willl be here for me, but he said i had to move on. He invited me over the next day.

That day he made me food, coffee — looked after me like he still cared. We talked. I asked if I could take my shirt off (I was hot),cause i excercised lmao after being on call with his friend and he said it was fine. Later, in his room, he said again he didn’t want to use me, that he felt guilty, but debated whether to be intimate. i asked him if he wanted me to put my shirt back on but he was fine with me having it off.  I told him i was okay with it — because emotional connection mattered  to me since it was hard to let everything go considering the past weeks. That day, we were intimate again. He told me I couldn’t say “I love you” anymore, and when I slipped, he reminded me. he said that if he gets a gf we would have to stop being intimate which did hurt me but i was fine with it anyhow cause yk. I remember zoning out while kissing him, and he asked what was wrong. I couldn’t say it, but I was scared — scared that he was slowly detaching while pretending to still be close. i cried during cuddling and stuff and he said ""dont cry now"" and like ""cry when its over"". 

Later, I learned he had asked someone else to a ball around the time we were intimate.she did just wanna go as friends tho. He braided another girl’s hair in front of me 2 days after i last went to his house and was intimate w him. even though they were jus friends and that girl had a bf.

And I still don’t think he meant to be cruel. I think he’s scared. Unhealed. Emotionally blocked. But I gave him love, trust, patience. I never tried to force anything. I showed up, again and again. When I finally slipped — one small, fear-driven lie — he walked away. That still makes me feel worthless. he sounded like he didnt care for me at all and didnt want me talking to him, said i lost privalege of hugs when i last called him to talk ab the whole situation ab me lying outta fear. he said to call if its an absolute emegency since he has other friends to take care of and i apologized for crying and he said its ok hes a therapist for a lot of ppl. he said to me to not think hes just free sitting around for or smth like that which hurt cause whenever i needed him and felt sad i called cause he was my comfort zone.

I know I’m not perfect. But I was real. Loving. Soft. Consistent. I didn’t play games. I just wanted to show him that not everyone hurts you.

Maybe I was the love he wasn’t ready for. was i in the wrong? i messed up i shouldve never lied.",1,1751098361.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
