Chapter 1
Ten years after being cast out by my family, my mate, and my pack, I met my former Alpha mate and brother by adoption in a small town.

After all these years apart, one had become a decorated Alpha warrior, the other a high-ranking Alpha—and I was just running a tiny coffee shop.

The moment our eyes met, both men froze for a long time.

Then Adrian hid the pregnancy test in his hand behind his back, and Mike slipped the jewelry he'd bought for his sister into his pocket.

I lowered my gaze, packed up the cake and coffee, and handed them over politely.

""Here you are, Alphas.""

The overly distant address made both of them falter for a second.

As they pushed open the door to leave, Adrian suddenly turned around and asked,

""You said you'd never bake desserts again for the rest of your life, didn't you?""

I smiled politely. ""Just something foolish I said in anger.""

The sound of children laughing and playing outside drifted in faintly through the glass door, but it couldn't break the stagnation inside the shop.

The two Alphas who'd teamed up to have me cast out from the pack all those years ago still stood at the cash register, refusing to leave.

Adrian clutched the box of macarons and coffee, his throat worked,

""Eden's having bad morning sickness. We're bringing her to stay south of the pack for a while.""

""Your mother… came with us too.""

""Would you like to see her?""

I shook my head as I wiped the counter. ""No need. Give my regards to Luna Juliet.""

Pausing, I added, ""Or don't mention it at all—better to avoid misunderstandings.""

My foster brother Mike's knuckles whitened as he tightened his grip,

""Hazel, all these years we—""

""Hazel!""

A girl with dyed green hair bounced through the door, threw her arms around mine, and shook me, ""I'm starving!""

A genuine smile finally spread across my face as I tapped her nose, ""There's your favorite chocolate chip cookie in the fridge.""

""Noooo,"" Isla whined, ""Hazel, eat with me.""

I glanced helplessly at the two men, my smile fading: ""Alphas, your cake and coffee are ready.""

Adrian's gaze flickered when he heard ""chocolate chip cookie.""

Mike stared blankly at Isla's lively figure, the rest of his words died on his lips.

I took Isla's hand and walked into the back kitchen, the automatic door sliding shut to cut off their view.

When I emerged again, the shop was empty.

Isla mumbled around her fork: ""Hazel, do you know those two Alphas? They were looking at you weird.""

""When they arrived, I saw a whole entourage—warriors and everything.""

""I heard one's a famous Alpha warrior across all packs, and the other's a respected Alpha.""

I kept my head down as I sorted through receipts. ""Here, they're just customers.""

""If I really knew people like that,"" I poked her forehead gently, ""would I be waking up early every day to bake you cakes and cookies?""

Isla giggled, leaning in to whisper in my ear:

""Word is that Alpha warrior's Luna is that other Alpha's sister—they came all the way here for her to rest during her pregnancy. It must be wonderful to be so cherished.""

I nodded calmly, tossing a used piping bag into the trash can.

Of course I knew how much they spoiled Eden.

After all, ten years ago—

One had had me committed to a werewolf psychiatric hospital on our mating ceremony night, branding me a laughingstock, a madwoman.

The other had announced my death to the pack and personally driven me out into exile.

Together, they'd shattered me completely and cast mee into a living hell.

1qd8fmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1qd8fmh/top_surgery_was_today/,Top Surgery was Today!,"Thanks to anesthesia I have mostly been sleeping today but unable to move all that great I'm bored so here I am detailing some of my experience.

I had top surgery today :)

It was also coincidentally my first ever surgery. So here's how it went down so people like me who also have anxiety know what to expect.

Checking in. Pretty easy. They checked me and my mother in (because she's my ride, legally you have to have a ride and it can not just be an uber or lyft.)   
They took her number to text her updates and call her when I was out of surgery because she had to run family around.

They take me back in a wheelchair. I dont know if the wheelchair was because I had my cane, but they did put me in a wheelchair to wheel me to the bathroom where they gave me stuff to change into and bags for my stuff.   
I got see-through hospital underwear, grippy socks, a hospital gown, and a hair cap.

They had me do a urine sample. They didnt have like, a specific urine sample cup, they gave me one of those disposable foam coffee cups. Which was funny to me. Because I went to the bathroom right before surgery, and it averages a 2-4 hour surgery, I didn't need a catheter (thank god).

The nurse also gave me a bitty bottle of iodine and a set of four foam swabs that look like q-tips. I had to use them to shove iodine up my nose.  
Surprisingly didnt stink, but my nose still feels weird. When i rubbed my nose later my hand turned yellow. Something about preventing a specific infection, dont remember which one.

They got me onto a waiting chair with a leg rest.   
Did my blood pressure and checked my heart rate. Did my IV. IVs suck, they went through the back of my hand. I'm lucky I dont have a bruise, but I can clearly see the spot where the IV was on the back of my hand. Left the blood pressure squeezy thingy on my arm the whole time because they used it in OR too.  
The nurse helped me put on see-through thigh-high compression socks and slid on some sort of sleeve that would squeeze my legs every minute-ish to help bloodflow. The compression thigh highs were funny because she put plastic baggies on my feet to slide the socks on, because the socks have holes in the toe and it gets them on easier. Helped me slide them up to my thighs, slid the plastic baggie out through the toe-hole, and put my grippy socks back on over it.   
They put tags on my two bags of belongings and put a sticker with my info on my cane. 

They gave me the meds I was supposed to take with a little sauce-cup of water and replaced the nausea patch they put behind my ear. They put my medical bracelets on me. Apparently I was a fall risk. I imagine that's because I showed up with my cane and knee braces. 

The surgeon came to talk to me before he scrubbed in. The anesthesia doctor came and talked to me. Told me not to be worried, as I've never been under before and have very very few risk factors. Apparently being on testosterone extremely marginally raises your risk of a heart attack, but the number he gave me was like ""it's basically 1 in 10,000 people, so you're gonna be fine."" And just to tell them if I got nauseous.

They offered me anxiety medicine in my IV. I didn't take it, but appreciated the option being freely given once I mentioned I was nervous. Shit in the IV seems to work fast as hell, so if you get there and you're super nervous but think it wont help because surgery is in just a few minutes, take it. 

They walked me, not wheeled me, from the waiting area where I was set up to the operating room. The nurse handed another doctor the bag of my iv fluids to hold while I laid down.

They didnt do that thing where they put the mask on and ask you to count back from ten. I laid down, they put a pillow underneath my knees because I've got a history of sprains (very nice of them imo) and I laid back.

Suddenly my vision was rocking back and forth. I didn't know if that was nerves or what, but looking back, I think the guy probably did my IV anesthetics as soon as it was handed to him.

I remember glancing at my nurse and going ""hey full disclosure my vision is starting to spin, is that normal?""  
""Yes honey, that's normal.""

And then I was dreaming.

Apparently one of the meds for nausea they put me on can cause nightmares. I didn't have nightmares, but she did warn me. I dont remember what I dreamed about. Snippets of whatever, pretty normal dreams, and then my eyes fluttered open in the recovery room. The way I woke up I felt confused, like ""ah shit its surgery day today"". It felt like I was waking up from normal sleep, not like i was knocked out and woke up.

A different nurse was there and asked me how I felt. I told her I was tired. She told me to go back to sleep. I dont think i actually realized my chest was gone at that point.  
I remember laying there thinking ""ah man my nipples feel weird"", before remembering ""oh shit I dont have those anymore, what feels weird?""   
It was the drains. The drains felt weird. They still do. 

Slept for about an hour before I could keep my eyes open longer than 20 seconds. They went and got my mother, taught her how to help my drains and did my first drain clear right there. Gave me a little cup of water with a straw.   
Which was nice, because I've always been told you dont get water after surgery, you get ice chips. They gave me the option of water or applejuice. They didnt offer gingerale because apparently Im supposed to limit carbonation. But they did say Im allowed a little gingerale or coca cola for nausea. 

Had a sore throat when I woke up. I was also told the gas they use during surgery after IV anesthetics can often give people sore throats. Not that bad, I expect it to be gone tomorrow.  
  
Got home. Got on the sofa.  
Called my grandmother, who was so anxious about me going under the first time she was apparently crying to my mother on the phone (very supportive, just an anxious old lady)  
Passed out for 3 hours.  
Mom woke me up to clear the tubing of clots and check my drains. Feels weird. I can feel where the drains enter my skin.  
Went back to sleep.   
She woke me up to have me take my meds and eat some soup. And now I'm teetering between sleeping and being just awake enough to be bored. 

So here we are.

I was given oxy, and they encouraged me to take it in the hospital. I said I didnt think I was in quite that much pain. The nurse told me ""dont think you have to tough it out. If you think you need it, please take it.""

I told her to give me the two tylenol. She gave me two tylenol. It helped settle the pain just enough to stand and get my clothes on at the recovery room. 

It only hurts BAD when I change positions. Which I do every so often for my bad knee and Im supposed to walk around every hour to prevent deep vein thrombosis. 

I feel the best when I just wake up. Feels like a snug binder, wrapped up in ace bandages.  
It's funny looking down and seeing my fat belly instead of my tiddies :)  
My proportions are gonna give me the funkiest looking pot-belly ever but even that I'm thrilled about.

I had to have one straight incision all the way across my chest- pit to pit- because my breasts meet in the middle. Fun fact thats why lots of top scars look different, it's based on the shape and size of your breasts and whether or not they remove/reattach your nips.

Because it's a straight incision all the way across, I drain more fluid on the side I lean to, alternating about every other time.

My chest is however still covered in iodine and the markings the surgeon did before he started.   
Hopefully when I see him tomorrow and he re-does my bandaging he'll let me wipe that off. I have purple 'cleavage' drawn on because that's how he had to mark the midline lmao.

All in all just super tired.  
Figured a clear breakdown of everything that happened might be good.

Bonus facts:  
Yesterday my roommate's cat, who is notoriously not a cuddler and the only way she ever gets on someones lap is jumping off the stairs behind the sofa onto you to use you as a stepping stone, came and laid in my lap for two hours purring up a storm and rubbing her head all over me.   
I think she knew.

And today, home with my parents for recovery, our pitbull has been sitting in the corner very concerned.   
When mom cleared my drains the dog sat next to me, extremely concerned, with the biggest pitbull-pouty lip I've ever seen. She never comes close enough to pet her (im not supposed to anyways) but she keeps changing spots in the living room like she's keeping an eye on me. ",1,1768447276.0,trans,2,1.0,False
1qd8f7i,https://i.redd.it/d349wujujfdg1.jpeg,Cloudy with a Chance of Conspiracy: The Wild World of Chemtrails vs. Contrails,"I was lying on my back in the grass last Tuesday, watching a jet etch its white line across the blue, when my neighbor leaned over the fence.

""They're at it again,"" he said, shaking his head.

""Who?""

""*Them*. Spraying us.""

I blinked. The contrail was already dissolving into wisps.

This is how it starts ... not with dramatic music or a smoking gun, but with a simple question: *What are those lines in the sky?*

And depending on who you ask, you'll get two very different answers.

# The Science: What's Actually Happening Up There

When a plane flies at high altitude, we're talking 30,000 feet and above, its engines burn fuel and spit out hot, humid exhaust. The air up there is cold. Really cold. Often colder than -40°F.

What happens next is basic physics: water vapor from the exhaust hits that frigid air and instantly condenses into tiny ice crystals. Those crystals catch the light. That's your contrail ... short for ""condensation trail.""

Sometimes they vanish in seconds. Other times, if the air is humid enough, they stick around and spread into cirrus-like clouds. The atmospheric conditions determine how long they last, not what's in them.

Meteorologists have been documenting this since the 1920s, back when high-altitude flight was still new and strange. It's the same principle that lets you see your breath on a winter morning, just happening six miles up.

# The Conspiracy: Enter the Chemtrail

But for a growing number of people, those lines aren't innocent byproducts of combustion. They're evidence of something darker.

The chemtrail theory suggests that certain aircraft are deliberately releasing chemical or biological agents into the atmosphere ... for weather modification, population control, psychological manipulation, or some combination thereof. The trails that linger too long, spread too wide, form grid patterns in the sky? Those aren't contrails. Those are *chemtrails*.

I've gone down this rabbit hole more than once, late at night with too much coffee. The forums. The YouTube documentaries with ominous music. The analysis of ""unusual"" flight patterns. There's a whole ecosystem of people photographing skies, testing rainwater, connecting dots.

And I get it. I really do.

# Why This One Sticks

Most conspiracy theories ask you to believe in hidden agendas. This one asks you to believe your own eyes.

Look up. There they are. White lines crisscrossing the sky, sometimes dozens of them. If you've never thought about it before, it *does* look weird. It *does* look like something's being sprayed. And once you start noticing, you can't stop.

The chemtrail narrative offers something seductive: an explanation for the vague unease many of us feel about the world. Why does everything feel off? Why do so many people seem sick, anxious, exhausted? Maybe it's not capitalism or climate change or the slow grind of modern life. Maybe it's *the sky*.

It's a story that makes the invisible visible. It names the enemy. And in a world that often feels impossibly complex and out of our control, that clarity, even if it's false clarity, can feel like relief.

# The Gap Between Feeling and Fact

Here's where I land, and it's not a place of smug certainty.

The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Atmospheric scientists, chemists, meteorologists, people who've spent their entire careers studying air and weather, all say the same thing: those are contrails. Ice crystals. Not chemicals.

Independent researchers have tested the air, the water, the soil. No secret spraying programs have been verified. Commercial pilots, military pilots, aviation engineers, thousands of people who would have to be in on it, have spoken up to say: this isn't happening.

But feelings don't care about consensus.

If you feel unsafe, if you feel manipulated, if you look at the institutions that are *supposed* to protect you and see corruption or indifference... then why would you trust them about this? Why would you believe the ""experts"" when experts have been wrong before, when they've lied before, when they serve power before people?

That's the real conversation here. Not the science. The trust.

# What I Think About When I Look Up

I believe there are experiments and ongoing cloud seeding projects but I don't believe in wholesale chemical warfare. It's easy to track the cause of a trail by going to flightradar24.com.  I believe in the instinct that makes people look up and question what they're being told.

I think we live in a time when it's rational to be suspicious. When corporations *do* poison communities and cover it up. When governments *have* conducted secret experiments on their own citizens. When the truth has been bent so many times that skepticism feels like survival.

The tragedy is when that healthy skepticism gets misdirected. When we're so busy staring at contrails that we miss the actual pollution,  the stuff we *know* is killing us. The carbon. The plastics. The forever chemicals in our water. The air quality alerts that are becoming routine.

Those things don't require a conspiracy. They're happening in broad daylight, with paperwork.

# Living in the Question

I'm not here to convince anyone. If you believe in chemtrails, nothing I say will change your mind, and honestly, that's okay. We're all trying to make sense of a world that often doesn't make sense.

What I will say is this: the sky is big enough for uncertainty.

You can look up and wonder. You can notice the planes, the patterns, the way some days the trails linger and some days they don't. You can ask questions. You can be curious about what you're breathing, what's being done to the planet, who benefits and who pays.

Just maybe... also leave room for the mundane answer.

Sometimes a contrail is just ice crystals catching light.

Sometimes the conspiracy is quieter and closer than we think, not in the sky, but in the soil, the water, the policies written in fine print.

Sometimes the hardest truth is that there isn't a single villain to unmask. Just a thousand small violences we've all agreed to live with.



I still lie in the grass and watch the planes. I still see the white lines. I still wonder about the world and what we're doing to it.

But mostly, I'm just here. Present. Breathing. Watching the sky do what it does.

And that, I think, is its own kind of power.",1,1768447243.0,Wealthness,0,1.0,False

​""Most people wake up and crave caffeine. I woke up today and craved something much deeper.
​I walked into the kitchen, still half-asleep, and found My Mom, Aarohi standing at the counter. She was wearing this thin, sleeveless silk top, the kind that barely has any structure. One strap had already given up and slid down her arm, revealing the soft, upper curve of her breast. She didn't bother fixing it. She just kept stirring the coffee, humming to herself.
​I didn't say 'Good morning.' I just walked up behind her, wrapped my arms around her waist, and buried my face in the crook of her neck. She didn't flinch. She didn't pull away or act 'proper.' She just leaned back into me, letting the warmth of our bodies fuse together in the morning light.
​I didn't want the coffee she was making. I wanted the 'milk' that only she could provide. And since she had already left the door half open with that falling strap... I didn't let the opportunity go to waste. In that quiet kitchen, the boundaries weren't just blurred; they were completely irrelevant.
​Later, we were sprawled out on the couch. I was resting my head on her lap, and I told her my theory. I told her that a Mother’s love should be unconditional, sure but it should also be physical. I told her that a woman given to you by default in life should be the most beautiful, striking, and bold creature you ever see. There’s nothing 'wrong' with being attracted to the one person who is truly yours.
​'Mothers should never stop milking that devotion, Ma,' I told her. 'You should be chaotic. You should be bold. You shouldn't look like a ""mom""; you should look like a Goddess.'
​Mom didn't lecture me. She didn't look shocked. Instead, I saw her chest swell with pride. Her ego was fed. She looked down at me, running her fingers through my hair with a look of absolute ownership, and whispered:

right off the bat, he made it very clear he was interested in me romantically which I respectfully shut down and he did one of those, ""handles it well in the moment but keeps persisting passively"", type deals and still does. he has started to bring me gifts. An Xbox, things for my cats, pretty decorations for my place, etc. a lot of very thoughtful things. i have made sure to remain grateful, but neutral, and stress that gifts are not an expectation.

now, he has always has boundary issues. more like he will tell me something he thinks I should do (you should move this thing here, or try this, or go to this place) and does not take no for an answer. He tried to get me to go to the gym with him today and asked for HOURS relentlessly. Sometimes it almost feels like a memory issue but idk. anyway.

A few days ago, he asked if we could get some plants for my place. i said ""sure, let's go tomorrow."" He didn't answer, but I assumed he would text me in the morning. I wake up, and he is IN my house, (he had my keypad code from cat sitting for me one weekend), with coffee and breakfast. I was fucking terrified.

Then i check my phone and he said ""I'm coming in hope you don't have anyone over."" Like yeah what if i did? I am single with no roommates but even it just being me is like what the FUCK.

Fast forward to today, he asks to come over bc he lost his job and i need help with some maintenance so i agree. He asks me what I would do if someone broke in. And repeatedly pretends to ""charge"" me. Well, the final time, he grabs me by the neck and chokes me. I didn't lose consciousness, but it hurt and hours later still does. He is sitting next to me rn bc he got too drunk to leave but like idk what to do. He is getting agitated as he is drifting in and out of consciousness bc he can tell i'm being ""off.""

This behavior is completely unacceptable and I know the stats behind putting hands around necks. i need to cut this off, but he has a history of violence and so does his family, even my ex best friend said he can revert back to those tendencies when he's drunk which he is rn.

I just quit my job after 5 days onboard, and I feel ashamed, guilty, incapable, and like I betrayed everyone who believed in me.

On the morning of my first day, the company hosted a welcome and culture talk for new hires. After lunch, I was sent to my project’s office. HR emailed me a list of mandatory lessons I needed to complete within a week, while also setting up my environment and handling everything else. The project I was assigned to is a huge platform with more than 15 services. I was expected to handle at least 4 of them. Working at night was not mandatory, but it was an expectation.

On day 2, the project PM approached me and asked if I could continue those lessons at home, and she wanted me to start joining knowledge training sessions related to the domain, source code, workflows, etc. I didn’t have a problem with that.

On day 4, I started working on the project. The first few tasks weren’thard, but there was code smell everywhere (I’m not saying I’m a good developer), and a few bugs showed up. I needed to fix them because they were blocking my work.

On day 5, while I was still busy with my current task, I was asked to join a kick-off meeting for another app and was expected to start working on it the next day.

My company starts work at 8. I wake up at 6, shower, have breakfast, then head to the shuttle bus, which leaves at 7. It’s a one-hour commute on a cramped bus, and bad traffic makes it even worse. On the way home, the bus leaves at 17:15. If I miss it or have to stay late at the office, I have to wait until 19:30 and won’t reach my home until 21:00. By then, I’m too tired to do anything else, just dinner, a shower, and bed.

I’m writing this in a coffee shop while calling HR to tell them I quit. My family thinks I’m working right now. I feel very heavy. Maybe I’m not as good as everyone expected. Maybe I’m a quitter and can’t handle pressure. The HR (not beg) but gave me several good reasons to reconsider, which made me feel even heavier.

I'm an American with a New Year's resolution of reading at least one book a month this year, and what better way to reach this goal than with others? I’m hoping to gather a small, steady group of around five people in Tokyo who want to read more in 2026.

The book club would be fiction-focused (we’d potentially take turns choosing the book of the month) and would meet once a month to discuss the book and hang out, likely after work on a weekday or on a relaxed weekend at a cafe/coffee shop.

I’d love for this to be a long-term thing, so I’m looking for Tokyo residents only, and folks who can genuinely commit to reading one book a month and showing up. No pressure to be a literary scholar! Just curious minds and decent follow-through. No costs are associated with this group. Just pay for your own book/coffee when we meet up!

Still, I would really appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation.**

**TL;DR:**  
**I’m in a long-distance relationship where I feel I’m putting in much more effort than my boyfriend. He rarely initiates calls, replies late with short messages, and hasn’t kept his promise of regular video calls. This makes me feel emotionally neglected.**

**He had a long, intense relationship with his ex and, although they broke up due to toxicity, they are friends again. The way he talks about her and the fact that she’s close to his family makes me fear he still has unresolved feelings.**

**He recently changed plans and decided to move back to his home city instead of staying near his current city for a PhD, due to visa and financial concerns. This means we’ll be long-distance for at least six more months, and I’m afraid the distance and his ex’s proximity could lead him to leave me for her.**

**I don’t think he’d cheat, but my insecurities are triggered by past experiences with an ex who wasn’t over his exes. I want to know if my fears are reasonable, how to manage my insecurity, and whether this relationship can realistically work.**

COMPLETE BACKGROUND:

Background about my bf: He was born in the same country as me, but has lived in a neighboring country for 10 years. His home city and current city are around 3 hours apart by car. He's currently doing his master's and works two shifts (7–11 a.m. and 6–10 p.m.). He also lives with relatives who rely on him for many errands, so he’s usually busy and tired. He met his ex while visiting his home city and they did long distance for around 4 years. He broke up with her due to toxicity in the relationship 3 years ago and blocked her everywhere. A fewmonths before I met him (this year) she contacted him through a friend and asked him if there was any possibility they could get back together and he refused. After that they became friends and she told him about the issues he had with her partner (I'm not sure if she's still dating this new guy). My bf says he only talks to her if she contacts him first.

About my relationship with my bf: We met late September while I was doing a semester abroad in his country. It started casually and later became official. He treated me well in small ways (like bringing me coffee), and we saw each other about once a week (more frequently toward the end), sometimes staying together until very late. However, there where some issues that where very frustrating to me: cancelling dates last minute,not returning calls, taking too long to respond to my texts, he also never properly asked me to be his gf, he just started introducing me as such and later asked if I was ok with it. I made effort to make sure he felt loved by helping him whenerver I could, but maybe I wasn't doing enough. We dated in person for around 3 months and have been doing long distance for 1 month.

Current situation: Long distance has been hard, sometimes he takes too long to answer texts and if he answers fast it's mostly short replies and I don't always like it when he turns the conversation into something sexual. He promised me we could do videocalls 3 times a week, so far it's been 4 times in the span of 5 weeks and I'm always the one that takes the initiative and ask him to call me. The first time we even had a fight because he didn't call me at the time we agreed and I had to call him and then the call ended abruptly because he ran out of battery. He promised he will take more initiative but hasn't done anything about it.

The issue with his ex: Whenever he talks about his ex iit feels like he still misses her. He has said he’ll never forget her, which I understand, but the way he talks about their past makes me feel like he loved her more than he will ever love me. He had told me that they facetimed and texted a lot, had dates, gave her flowers and he has never done those things for me. I understand he had more free time back then and she lived closer by, but it still makes me feel like he's making excuses for me. One time he posted me on my instagram and he told me she messaged him: ""Is that your new gf?"" and he talked to her about me, which made me feel a little uncomfortable.When I talk about my ex, I only mention behaviors that hurt me and that I don’t want repeated. A few weeks ago I asked him to not talk about his ex because I just keep comparing myself to her.

MAIN ISSUE: He had told me that after graduating this May he was going to move to another city in the same state to do his PhD and work. However, yesterday he told me he canceled those plans and will move back to his home city instead. He said it’s because he’s worried about renewing his permit (he’s not a permanent resident) and about money. This confused me because he’s lived there for 10 years and had been saving to become a permanent resident. I can somehow understand because laws in that country have become more strict regarding foreigners.

MY INSECURITY:I feel very anxious about him suddenly moving back, especially since I won’t graduate until December, meaning we’ll be apart for at least six more months. He has always said I could move with him after graduating, even before changing his plans. I don't think I am going to feel comfortable if his ex contacts him (she still lives in his home city) again, which could happen since she became close to his family. I don't think he will cheat on me but I feel like there is a high chance he could leave me for her because they would be able to have a normal relationship without the distance. He told me that when he was with her, he often asked her to “wait for him,” and it seems like she still wants him back. This triggers me deeply because my previous ex left me because he was never over his first ex and was secretly talking to another ex.

MY QUESTIONS:

Part of me still has hope that things might improve once he moves back to his city and has more time, but I feel very unsure about where this is going. Still, I want to try to make it work.",1,1768446348.0,relationships,6,1.0,False

right off the bat, he made it very clear he was interested in me romantically which I respectfully shut down and he did one of those, ""handles it well in the moment but keeps persisting passively"", type deals and still does. he has started to bring me gifts. An Xbox, things for my cats, pretty decorations for my place, etc. a lot of very thoughtful things. i have made sure to remain grateful, but neutral, and stress that gifts are not an expectation.

now, he has always has boundary issues. more like he will tell me something he thinks I should do (you should move this thing here, or try this, or go to this place) and does not take no for an answer. He tried to get me to go to the gym with him today and asked for HOURS relentlessly. Sometimes it almost feels like a memory issue but idk anyway.

A few days ago he asked if we could get some plants for my place, i said sure let's go tomorrow. He didn't answer but I assumed he would text me on the morning. I wake up and he is in my house, (he had my keypad code from cat sitting for me one weekend), with coffee and breakfast. I was fucking terrified.

Then i check my phone and he said ""I'm coming in hope you don't have anyone over."" Like yeah what if i did? I am single with no roommates but even it just being me is like what the FUCK.

Fast forward to today, he asks to come over bc he lost his job and i need help with some maintenance so i agree. He asks me what I would do if someone broke in. And repeatedly pretends to ""charge"" me. Well, the final time, he grabs me by the neck and chokes me. I didn't lose consciousness, but it hurt and hours later still does. He said he was trying to ""teach me how to protect myself."" He is sitting next to me rn bc he got too drunk to leave but like idk what to do. He is getting agitated as he is drifting in and out bc he can tell i'm being ""off.""

This behavior is completely unacceptable and I know the stats behind putting hands around necks. i need to cut this off, but he has a history of violence and so does his family, even my ex best friend said he can revert back to those tendencies when he's drunk which he is rn. How do I tactfully cut off a friendship with a violent person who literally has my keypad code and has already shown will use it as his convenience?? ty in advance.",0,1768446338.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

We  are not very athletic but we live in NYC so we do not have concerns with walking.

We both work very stressful jobs and like to relax on vacation, but we are not lay on the beach for a week kind of people. The most adventurous we've probably been a weeklong trip to the White Mountains in NH and Acadia National Park in Maine and we loved it, but we definitely did it at our pace.

Questions:

1. My husband and I are big foodies. Part of our hesitation going here is that the food doesn't seem to be outstanding, but we've gotten to the point where we have stopped caring about the food because we want to go. That being said, are there any hidden gems worth going to? We don't need fancy food - hole in the walls are fine as long as they are good!
2. Does my schedule seem ok for a slower / relaxation pace? Anything major I am missing? I know Shi Shi Beach - I so desperately wanted to add it but I fear it's beyond what we are willing to do. I'm not concerned about the mileage; I am just concerned about the ruggedness of it and being unprepared. I don't want to get halfway there and regret our decision and have it ruin a day. Will I regret skipping it?
3. Seattle: We are torn between leaving on Friday on a red eye, Saturday during the day, or a Saturday red eye. We have never been to Seattle and though the point of trip is to go to ONP, we know we probably won't be back anytime soon so want to spend some time in Seattle too. The red eye on Friday feels like we would be rushing since we wouldn't even have a full day there, but I absolutely loathe flying during the day from the west coast to the east coast and losing so much time. But I'm also old and getting home on a Sunday morning after a redeye flight will fuck me up for the work week because I'm a baby and can't deal with poor sleep (I can't believe I used to take redeyes on Sunday nights and work on Monday). Should we juts suck it up and do the Saturday night flight?

When I first traded options I made around 8k with a 1k investment with AMC when it short squeezed and bought myself a nice challenger w that (v6 lol). Long story short I kept trying to replicate that over and over and over again. Either with crypto, sports betting, trading options, actual gambling with bacarrat you name it i’ve done it. But yeah all in all i’m probably down around 40k maybe a bit more. And 25k was given to me by my Dad before he passed  away.

His hands felt weak from holding the receiver; his heart slowed to something resembling normal. Reaching the bed, Jake lay down, the blanket closing around his lonely body. The dim light attracting careless moths reflected in the droplets slowly sliding down his cheek.

Morning arrived like a loop—again with birdsong. His body ached as if after heavy training: sore muscles, dull joints. He got up, walked to the kitchen, and made black coffee with cream. The drink woke him, but also mirrored his emptiness: he looked older than his age, the stubble making him seem worn, as if he had aged several years overnight.

The search had become routine. Many possible paths, but every one led to a dead end. Walking the streets felt like repeating the same equation—same steps, same answers.

The sunlight shifted from white to pink as the city grew quieter. Heavy thoughts dissolved for a moment, but the scars on his arm pulled him back to what had happened. Jake sat on the curb by the labyrinth, looking at the landscape and feeling the dried crust of blood under his fingertips.

Click.

The sound came from the right, echoing off the labyrinth’s walls.
A click — old, rusty shears.

Squinting, Jake saw an elderly man. He was different from the others — alone, a real figure among cardboard townsfolk.
Click — another sprout snapped off and fell.

The gardener, whom Jake had never noticed before, was tall and wiry, wearing round glasses that reflected the world as a flat picture. A dark yellow coverall hung on his frame, his face covered with stubble, thick unkempt mustache and brows. Despite the warm weather, his arms were hidden under a heavy dark sweater pulled down to his wrists.

He worked automatically, movement after movement repeating itself. Jake watched him as the man slowly approached.

A little more than a meter away, the gardener stopped, turned his head, and said:

“Good afternoon. Night is coming quicker now, which means winter is close. Got a cigarette?”

Jake silently pulled one from his pocket and handed it over. The man took it with thin fingers, tore off the filter, and clamped it between his lips.

He thanked him — his voice surprisingly clear for someone smoking straight tobacco.

The gardener sat beside him, calmly drawing in smoke. He didn’t rush, exhaling into the fading light, almost dissolving in it.

The two of them sat together, leaning against the thick foliage, quietly watching the evening advance.

“What’s the meaning of all this?” the man asked.

“All of what?”

“The meaning of existence. Of life. What do you think?”

“I don’t think about that. I have bigger problems.”

“Think about it. Then you’ll find the answers you’re looking for.”

“What do you want me to say? I’m not a philosopher. This stuff doesn’t interest me.”

“I’m not a philosopher either. But you still haven’t thought about it. Try.”

“Just get to the point.”

“The point is meaning. The whole meaning is to live life in happiness.”

“Happiness?”

“A state anyone can reach. Anywhere, whatever they’re doing. Happiness is brief, but you can catch it.”

“I can’t be happy until I find what I’m looking for.”

“And what are you looking for, boy?”

“I lost my love. Lost my girlfriend. And my child.”

“You’re tied down. Bound like with rope. Let go — and it will ease.”

“I can’t. And I won’t. I need to know what happened to her.”

But you CAN get iced tea. If you order an unsweet tea, and ask them to add cream & sugar and 3 pumps of chai, you will receive a budget friendly drink that tastes a whole lot like an iced chai tea latte :)

It’s not a perfect replica, and it still has a bit of a heavier black tea aftertaste than a regular latte, but for me, having it as an affordable option has made a big difference.

When I’m bouncing between different coffees, I end up saving a few bags like little souvenirs. I like the label art, the origin notes, and whatever lore the brand is trying to tell, even when it’s a little corny.

That’s why I got weirdly interested in the black-necked crane recently. It’s tied to high-altitude ecosystems, and it made me think about how a mascot can actually connect to where the coffee comes from instead of just being random vibes.

Anyone else do the “bag collection” thing? And what’s a mascot or brand story you actually liked?",3,1768445409.0,pourover,7,0.8,False

Latest chapter：Chapter 21: Chapter 21
“Beckett, you’re getting married in two weeks. What’re you gonna do about the sugar baby you’ve got tucked away?”

My feet stopped like they’d been nailed to the floor, my fingers tightening so hard around the glass I thought it might crack, because I already knew that tone—men laughing like women were a problem to file away.

Beckett’s voice followed, lazy and detached. “Keep your mouths shut. As long as none of you run your mouths, Sage Hollis won’t find out.”

One door. That was all that separated me from the man I’d loved for years, and in that thin space my whole life went weightless.

Tears blurred my vision so fast I couldn’t even blink them back.

He wasn’t just cheating—he was planning it, managing it, turning me into a secret he could control. The humiliation hit first, hot and choking, and then something colder settled in underneath it, something that didn’t cry or plead or bargain.

I didn’t knock. I didn’t storm in. I turned away and made an appointment to erase myself, because later I’d learn the one who couldn’t crawl out of this wasn’t me.

······

“Ms. Hollis, I need to confirm,” the woman on the phone said gently. “Once we start, it takes about two weeks. Your legal name change and relocation paperwork goes through, and the people who know you won’t be able to track you down the way they can now.”

They won’t be able to find me again.

Perfect.

I let out a small, bitter breath that almost sounded like a laugh, then forced my voice flat. “I’m sure.”

She paused, then continued, businesslike but kind. “Okay. Your new documents and transition plan will be ready once it’s complete. I hope this gives you a fresh start.”

A fresh start. I wanted to believe in that so badly it hurt.

When I hung up, I stood up too fast, my legs prickling from crouching there so long. I walked out to the curb, flagged a ride, and went home like I wasn’t carrying something broken inside my ribs.

I’d barely finished showering and was about to slide into bed when the door pushed open. The smell of whiskey hit first, then Beckett himself—warm, familiar, confident.

“Wifey,” he slurred, wrapping me up and pressing his face into my neck. “Why didn’t you come pick me up? I kept waiting. I swear, I did. You smell so damn good…”

His hands started roaming, greedy and comfortable, like my body was already his consolation prize.

I stared at the ceiling and let him nuzzle into me, and my mind drifted back to the beginning—the version of him I’d trusted with my whole life.

Beckett Northcott had chased me for three years. He’d brought coffee to places I never told him about, showed up in the rain, looked at me like I was the only woman on the planet.

When his mother tried to shut us down, he’d held me tight, “If my mom won’t let me marry you, then I just won’t get married. We’ll date forever. I’m never marrying anyone but you, Sage. You hear me?”

Then Mrs. Northcott stopped targeting me and dragged him home instead, pushing the Ransom family arrangement like it was a business deal she’d already signed.

When he finally came back to me, he looked wrecked—pale, hollow-eyed. I found out later he’d been refusing to eat, like starving himself was his way of proving he still belonged to me.

After that, no matter what his mother threatened, I didn’t back down, because I believed someone was fighting beside me.

How stupid.

How lucky I was to hear that conversation tonight, because if I hadn’t… how long would he have kept acting?

Until the wedding day? Until someone pointed at me in public and called me the mistress, and I finally understood I’d been set up to take the fall?

I swallowed the ache and gently pried his hands off me. “I’m tired tonight.”

He didn’t push, and somehow that made it worse. He guided me onto the bed like I was delicate, then climbed in behind me and wrapped himself around my back, warm and possessive.

“You’ve been looking thinner,” he murmured, soft with concern. “Get some sleep, okay? I’ve got you.”

I didn’t answer. I let my eyes close and pretended I was already gone.

The next morning, I woke up to him at the closet, changing like nothing in the world had shifted. He heard me move, turned, and came over with that easy confidence of a man who assumes he still owns tomorrow.

Reserved the basic room, $75 US. The upgraded Room offers a small desk, and room for a suitcase.   I cleared customs around 4:30pm.  Unfortunately, you can not check in until 7pm.  They did check me in and hold my luggage.  Went out had a beer and Ramen.  Came back a little after 6.  Hung out in their lounge with free WIFI and a few amenities.   Finally about 6:55pm they let me in.  They split the men and women into two sides.  The room is literally the size of a double bed.  Has a  TV, a lock box and a long shelf.  Very clean and comfortable.  The doors don't lock and are literally roll down doors,  Once I got settled and locked a few things in my box,  I headed to the Onsen. Not my 1st rodeo, do I followed protocol, cleaned up and soaked in the bath.  It was not a hot as other onsen, but it didn't suck. Everything was very clean and well equipped.  After settling back in my tiny spot, clean and relaxed, I crashed and slept like a rock, except for a moment when a drunk guy accidentally opened my door and I yelled at him.  I had an early flight to Akita so I got up 5:30 and had another soak in the Onsen.  This time is was a bit hotter.  Packed up and headed out.  Only to be surprised that the the terminal does not open until 7am.  So I had a cup of coffee and hung out for another 30 min.    Over all it is an excellent option  when international flights arrive too late for your domestic connection.  We usually buy our domestic separately, as it ends up being much cheaper.   I would give it 4 stars out of 5.  For what it is, its great. My big issue was the 7pm open times.  Seems just way too late to me.

We have done activities out of work and always get coffee and lunch together.

I realized a little bit ago that the only reason why I was still in the group was because of my friends. Through networking and such I was strongly encouraged to apply for a position in another group, it is a lateral move. I got offered said position and I accepted it earlier today.

My manager is aware and some of the people that I networked with too. But I haven’t told my friends yet. I am not expecting any backlash, but my heart is breaking at not being with them every in office day. I will still probably get coffee and lunch with them because most of my new group is in a different location.

My initial instinct was to text them after work, but then I didn’t want to hijack their nights. And now I am wondering if I should just video call them tomorrow, but I feel like I may cry and I don’t want to cry. I also can be awkward and stumble over my words when I have serious or difficult news and I hate it when that happens.

Does anyone have some advice for this?

1qd7mjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/comments/1qd7mjf/i_keep_hearing_my_daughter_call_for_me_at_night/,"I keep hearing my daughter call for me at night, but she’s never awake.","
It’s been a long week.
My wife took a trip upstate to visit her parents, and I stayed behind for work. It wasn’t supposed to be a big deal, just a few quiet nights at home with our daughter.

She caught something two days after her mom left. Just a little fever at first, nothing serious. Kids get bugs all the time, right? I told my wife not to worry. I had it under control.

The thing is, the fever never really went away.
 
It’ll break for a few hours, she’ll seem fine, and then it comes back even hotter. She’s been too tired to get out of bed for more than a few minutes at a time. I’ve been camped out on the couch with the baby monitor next to me so I can hear if she wakes up in the middle of the night.

The monitor’s old, one of those bulky ones. The speaker hums from the white noise machine we keep in her room. I keep it on even when I don’t need to, maybe because the sound makes the house feel less empty.

The first time I heard her whisper, I thought she was calling for water.
It was past midnight. I remember the way her voice crackled through the speaker, tired.

“Daddy…”

I went to her room, but she was fast asleep.
Her lips were dry. Her hair was stuck to her forehead.
I almost woke her to check her temperature, but she looked peaceful for once. So I just stood there, watching her sleep for a moment, and went back to the couch.

I told myself I imagined it. Probably the monitor catching some old feedback, or maybe just my mind replaying her voice from earlier. It has been an exhausting few days for the both of us so that wasn’t out of the question.

That night continued without anymore interruptions.

The next night is when things took a turn for the worse. 

I had put her down to sleep around 8:00 pm. She was run down and exhausted. Body aches, fever, and a headache. I had been giving her medicine throughout the day and it seemed to only have a slight impact on her. In my mind the only thing that was going to help was rest and lots of it. 

She was asleep not 5 minutes after I put her in the crib. My nightly routine didn’t change. I grabbed the pillows and blankets from my bed and headed to the couch to be closer to her room in case she needed me. I plugged the baby monitor in and began to drift off to sleep.

I shot up. My daughter was yelling for me.

“Daddy! Come get me!”

“I’m coming baby!” I yelled loud enough for her to hear.

I made my way down the hallway to her bedroom. I swung the door open. Only to find her sleeping. Motionless. I stood there confused. I couldn’t have imagined this again. I stepped into the room. Only the sound of her soft breathing and the white noise machine. I stepped closer to her crib. There she was sleeping, not moving, not coughing, nothing. I didn’t want to wake her but I was shaken. This was weird, scary if I’m being honest. I heard her calling me. I know I did. This wasn’t exhaustion.

I returned to the living room, confused and worried. Was she talking in her sleep? Was she just seeing if I was nearby? I wasn’t sure of what was going on but I was starting to get worried. I felt fine but maybe I was getting sick. I did feel a little warm but had no other symptoms. 

I swear just as I was drifting off to sleep. 

“Daddy, I don’t feel good.”

I didn’t answer, I just ran, straight to her room. Nearly ripping the door off the hinges as I opened it.

Sleeping. She was sleeping. I couldn’t believe it. She had to be talking in her sleep. Maybe her fever had gotten worse. I stepped closer, this time determined to figure out what was going on. I reached into her crib to feel her forehead.

I recoiled the moment my hand touched her. Intense heat radiated from her forehead. My hand hurt. In awe I looked at my palm. A burn mark. 

My daughter was producing enough heat to burn my hand.

Part 2

My daughter needed to go to the hospital. She needed help, more than I can provide.

I grabbed a few towels and rushed back to her room. I scooped her up and brought her to the car. I drove faster than I should but I needed to get her there.

I ran through the emergency room doors and straight to the check in counter.

“Help me please! My daughter she’s burning up!” 

I explained the situation the best I could. The worry on my face mixed with the details of the situation must have struck a chord with the nurses because they escorted us to a room right away. I placed my daughter on the bed. Through all of this chaos she was still asleep. After asking a few more questions and connecting an IV the nurse left and told me the doctor would be in as soon as possible.

I grabbed a chair and sat right next to her bed. She began to move and stir awake. 

A scream louder than I ever heard erupted from my daughter. Her back arched and vocal cords began to fry. 

I jumped to my feet. My ears were ringing from the volume of the scream. I could have sworn they began to bleed.

“BABY! BABY! WHATS HAPPENING! TELL DADDY!”

The scream continued.

I ran into the hallway searching for a doctor, a nurse, anyone that could help. No one nearby. I rounded the corner and saw a nurse behind a desk.

“HELP ME PLEASE! MY DAUGHTER, SHES SCREAMING! SOMETHING IS WRONG!”

The nurse paged for a doctor to my daughter’s room and followed me back.

When we walked in there was my daughter. 

Asleep.

The nurse walked to her bedside. And felt her forehead. She said she was warm to the touch but not extraordinarily hot.

My daughter’s eyes began to flutter open.

“Daddy? Where are we?”

Tears began to well in my eyes. “We are at the hospital honey. Something is wrong and these nice nurses and doctors are going to help us.”

The doctor came in about fifteen minutes later, clipboard in hand and calm in that practiced, detached way that only doctors can manage.
He asked questions, ran through the motions. Bloodwork, vitals, a scan.

When it was all done, he smiled.
“Good news. Everything looks perfectly normal.”

I stared at him. “Normal? Her temperature was through the roof. She was screaming, you didn’t hear it?”

He shook his head. “She’s stable now. Fevers can spike and drop rapidly in children, especially if they’re fighting something off.”

I wanted to believe him, but the words didn’t make sense. I held up my hand.
“Then how do you explain this?”

He leaned in.
There was nothing there.

No redness. No blister. No mark at all.

My voice cracked. “It burned me. I swear to God.”
He gave me that polite, cautious look. The kind that says we’ve seen this before.

I felt weak. My legs began to shake. I was going to pass out. The doctor grabbed a chair and told me to have a seat. They brought me water and did their best to calm me. It didn’t work at first but eventually I regained the little strength I had left.

They discharged us a few hours later.

The drive home was silent except for the hum of the tires on wet pavement.
Every so often, I glanced at her in the rearview mirror. She was asleep again, face calm, breathing soft.
I wanted to feel relief.
Instead, all I felt was dread.

By the time I pulled into the driveway, it was almost dawn.

I carried her inside, tucked her into bed, and turned to find my wife standing in the doorway.

Her eyes were red. Not from crying, but from exhaustion. Like she hadn’t slept in days.

She kissed our daughter on the head and I brought her to her room. I grabbed the baby monitor and headed back to my wife.

We hugged for what felt like forever.

Then she stepped back.

“Sit down,” she said quietly.
“We need to talk.”

Part 3


I sat on the couch, still in the same clothes I’d driven to the hospital in. My hands were trembling. Not from fear, at least not exactly. From confusion. Exhaustion.

My wife sat across from me, elbows on her knees, staring at the floor. The house was quiet. Even the hum of the fridge seemed to fade.

She didn’t look angry. She looked… defeated.

“Before I say anything,” she started, “you need to know I believe you.”

That should have helped, but it didn’t. It only made my stomach drop.

“I saw it” I said. “She was burning. And then the screaming”

She nodded slowly. “I know.”

“What do you mean, you know?”

She lifted her eyes to mine. There was no hesitation in her voice, no confusion. Just a terrible kind of calm.

“It happened to me too.”

The words didn’t make sense at first. She must have seen that on my face, because she went on.

“When I was little. Three, maybe four. My mom said I had a fever that wouldn’t break. They took me to the hospital just like you did with her. Ran every test they could think of. Everything came back fine. The next day, I was perfectly healthy.”

She let out a shaky breath. “My mom told me later… I wasn’t the first.”

I frowned. “What do you mean?”

“It happened once before. To my grandmother’s baby sister.” She swallowed hard. “Her mother, my great grandmother was desperate. The doctors couldn’t help. So she went to see someone. An old woman on the edge of town who promised she could save the child.”

My wife’s voice trembled. “There was a ritual. A promise. The fever stopped that night… but something came with it.”

My chest tightened. “Something?”

“My mom always said it was meant to protect us. A spirit that guards the bloodline. But it doesn’t feel like protection.” She looked away, her voice dropping to a whisper. “It feels like it’s waiting for something.”

The room felt colder.

“Waiting for what?” I asked.

She hesitated. When she finally spoke, her voice cracked.

“For the next one.”

Her words hung in the air. I waited for her to explain, but she didn’t. She just stared past me, eyes fixed on something that wasn’t there.

“The next what?” I asked. My throat felt tight.

I frowned. “You mean this thing, this… spirit, it’s going after her?”

She didn’t answer.

“I need you to tell me the truth” I said, leaning forward. “Is she in danger?”

That got her attention. She blinked, looked at me, and finally said, “She’s not in danger. Not yet.”

“Not yet?”

“My mom used to say the spirit watches the bloodline. It doesn’t hurt the ones it chooses, it marks them. The fever is how it starts.”

I could feel my heartbeat in my ears. “Marks them for what?”

She shook her head. “I don’t know. My mother didn’t either. She said her grandmother refused to talk about it. All she ever said was that the child always survives but something else doesn’t.”

The room felt smaller. Heavy.

“What do you mean something else doesn’t?”

She looked down at her hands. Her fingers were trembling. “There’s always a cost. My great-grandmother’s baby survived… but her husband didn’t. … I survived. My father passed not long after.”

The silence that followed was unbearable.

“She said it was protecting the bloodline” I murmured, more to myself than her. “So why does it feel like it’s punishing us?”

My wife didn’t answer. She just stared at the baby monitor on the coffee table. The faint static hummed through the speaker.

Then, from somewhere deep in the white noise, came a soft, broken whisper.

“Daddy…”

But this time, it wasn’t our daughter’s voice.

My wife’s head snapped toward the sound. Her face went white.

“Did you hear that?” I whispered.

She nodded, but didn’t move. Her eyes glistened like she was remembering something she didn’t want to.

Neither of us wanted to believe it.

The voice came again, faint and broken.
“Daddy come in here”

She stood, but not out of curiosity. Out of fear. Her movements were slow, hesitant.

“Don’t” I said.

But she was already walking down the hallway.

She stopped at the doorway to our daughter’s room.

The light from the night light spilled out into the hall. Our daughter lay still, her breathing calm.

My wife whispered, “She’s going to be fine…”

Her voice cracked on the last word, like she was trying to convince herself of it.

I stepped beside her. 

We both just stared at the crib. The monitor in her hand hissed softly.

Then, through the speaker, so faint I almost missed it, came a voice.

Not my daughter’s.
Not my wife’s.

A whisper, cold and close:
“She is.”

The monitor went silent.

For a long moment, neither of us moved.

My wife’s hand found mine, trembling. Her eyes never left the screen.

And then, barely louder than a breath, she said,
“It’s already chosen.”

Something in me just… snapped. Instinct. Panic. Love. I don’t know.

I rushed past her and scooped our daughter into my arms. Her skin was burning again. Hotter than before. Her head rolled back and a hoarse scream tore from her throat.

“Help me!” I yelled. “Do something!”

But my wife just shook her head, tears streaming down her face. “You can’t stop it.”

My daughter convulsed. Her hands clawed at my shirt, her little fingers digging into my wrist.
That’s when it happened.

The pain.

It was like fire under my skin. It started where she grabbed me and crawled up my arm, slow and deliberate. I tried to pull away, but she held on tight, impossibly strong for someone so small.

Her eyes snapped open.

For one horrible moment, they weren’t her eyes at all. They were black, deep and endless, reflecting nothing.

Then she gasped.

“Daddy?”

Her voice was small again. Familiar.

The burning stopped.

She blinked, dazed, then looked toward the doorway. “Mommy? You’re home!” she said softly, a smile spreading across her face. “I missed you.”

My wife dropped to her knees, sobbing, clutching her to her chest.

“She’s okay” she kept whispering. “She’s okay.”

But she wasn’t looking at me.

I stumbled backward, clutching my wrist. The skin was blistered and red, the veins beneath it glowing faintly, pulsing like they were alive.

Every heartbeat felt wrong. Slower. Hotter.

Something was moving inside me.



My daughter is sleeping soundly again.

My wife is sitting beside her, humming the same lullaby she used to sing when she was a baby. There’s relief in her eyes, but she won’t look at me.

Maybe she already knows.

My hand won’t stop shaking. The burn has spread up my arm, moving towards my chest. Every pulse feels heavier, slower, like my heart’s fighting something it can’t win against.

It doesn’t hurt anymore. That’s the worst part. The pain’s gone but the warmth stayed.

Something’s alive inside me. Breathing. Waiting.

Our daughter is fine now. Her fever’s gone.
Mine’s just beginning.

Whatever saved our daughter didn’t leave.

It just found a new place to live.

Banks flag transfers from crypto wallets, apps like Revolut throttle high-volume moves during market swings, and exchanges pile on fees or delays that make daily life feel impossible. As an Eastern European freelancer who's been paid in USDT and ETH from web3 projects for the past six months, I've tested various flows to make crypto income behave like a standard bank account—with reliable SEPA transfers and a virtual card—while dodging endless compliance checks.​

The real hurdle lies in converting irregular crypto payments into usable EUR that works seamlessly with European vendors, landlords, or utility providers. Services like Wise can take two to five days for transfers and often pause larger amounts over €5,000 weekly for reviews. Revolut handles smaller transactions fine but restricts bigger ones and sometimes locks accounts tied to crypto sources. Options such as Wirex or Trastra provide partial crypto integration, yet their SEPA processing times and IBAN consistency break down with consistent use. My working routine now involves swapping incoming USDT directly into an EUR balance, which supports a personal IBAN for near-instant SEPA transfers—typically under a minute to any EU bank—and a virtual card for routine expenses from coffee to groceries. Keytom joined this process after trying alternatives, offering consistent performance with total fees around 0.7 percent and monthly limits starting at €20k that match my needs. It manages the transition without fiat custody concerns, turning weekly client payments into something as straightforward as direct deposit.

Now I handle rent in one city and shopping in another without friction, backed by clean transaction records for any oversight. No more app-switching or justifying sources to wary support.

She initially said ""it almost sounds like a kind of arrhythmia"" - his HR was like switching rhythms every 30 seconds or so, hanging out in the 160s-180s for a little bit then would sort of skip a beat and drop suddenly to 80s-90s for a similar amount of time, then switch back. Constantly, for a full hour. *(Important to note my initial appointment was first thing in the morning - I'd only had water to drink, no caffeine! Though I have been indulging daily in coffee and/or diet coke, probably not past 200mg very often).* She consulted with another doctor, then another, then they called MFM, and then they sent me to the hospital for monitoring and ultrasound. At the hospital, the ultrasound really just ruled out hydrops (PHEW). He's measuring ahead, more like 34 weeks in terms of size, and his biophysical profile score was 8/8 and he was moving a ton, so they said he seemed well-oxygenated and happy, not acting like he's in distress, but his heart kept doing this weird pattern the whole time. I was having mild contractions - I couldn't even feel them, but apparently there was some correlation between when I'd contract and when his heart rate would dip. 

Hospital ended up sending me home after a few hours, but I'm booked for a fetal echocardiogram tomorrow with a pediatric cardiologist and then will need to meet with MFM. That's about all we have established so far re: ""next steps"" and I'm kind of struggling with how little it seems like we know. I'm just supposed to do kick counts and make sure he keeps moving, and I'm nervous to be separated from the monitors since his weird heart thing didn't resolve and is presumably just continuing to jump up and down :( My father in law is an OBGYN and I called him, and he too was totally stumped. At my 20 and 28 week ultrasounds with MFM (I had a low lying placenta) his heart structures looked functionally fine, so it seems unlikely there's a physical defect. Obviously would be great news to confirm that, but I'm also anxious anticipating it's going to be another appointment where we're just ruling something out but still don't know what's actually going on. If it were SVT his heart rate would be jumping higher than 180 (probably 200-220 as far as I understand it).

Anyone experience anything like this and care to share what was ultimately deduced? Or have suggestions on what questions I can ask to get information will help husband and I feel, if not reassured, at least more informed? ",2,1768444498.0,BabyBumps,3,1.0,False

A KNOCK on the door.

**Clive (o.s.)..** Brenda! Come on out...

**INT. BRENDA'S HOUSE - DAY**

BRENDA (30s) Dark haired, dark clothes, a bit fearful, confused and angry.

She rushes to the window and peeks out the curtains.

**Clive (cheerful, assured)..** The game is up! We know you're a witch, all right?

She closes the curtain in a fit.

**EXT. BRENDA'S HOUSE - DAY**

CLIVE (50s), overly earnest, dressed like authority but slightly off.

He is standing on the porch outside the house.

**Clive..** We saw your Louijee board on your profile picture on Tinder. We're not here to burn you... We just wanna talk.

**Brenda (from inside)..** Witches? \*laughs\* Aren't you a little too old to do role playing? What do you want from me? I'm calling the cops!

**Clive (mutters to himself)..** Not comfortable with finally getting some real attention, huh?

**INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY**

A woman (30s) in a standard documentary interview setup. 

Professional attire. Slightly dated.

Perfect posture. Serious expression.

**Expert..** When someone is seeking attention through their behavior, pointing out what they are doing becomes a threat to them because it unmasks their need for control. Still, asserting control over a witch is necessary and a common part of negation tactics today, used by professionals. If you think someone is practicing witchcraft it is better to contact your local church rather than to confront a witch all alone.

**EXT. BRENDA'S HOUSE - DAY**

**Clive..** That's all right, Brenda. We're just here to talk to you. Nobody is role playing anything... My name is Clive, all right? I'm a retired police officer…

Clive looks at his partner RODNEY (40s), socially fluent, quietly anxious, authority by proximity.

He nods short, but affirmingly back at Clive.

**Clive (cont'd)..** and a priest... We're here because your neighbors are worried about you. They say that you claim to have cast some spells on them... 

**Brenda (scoffs)..** Spells? Then I hope they are working...

**Clive..** They are not really worried about that, hun. They are worried about your well being.

**INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY**

**Expert..** It is important to establish trust when dealing with a witch, because once trust is established any resistance seems to disappear on its own, and then it becomes easier to help them with their affliction. 

**EXT. BRENDA'S HOUSE - DAY**

**Brenda..** If I can't call the cops on you, then I'll summon my help from beyond!

Clive looks a bit shaken and takes a moment to consider how he's going to reply.

**INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY**

**Expert..** Historically, people were afraid of witches which made it difficult to establish trust… Some even tried using garlic against them! \*laughs\* But that's only going to work in keeping your coworkers away.

**EXT. BRENDA'S HOUSE - DAY**

**Clive (sighs)..** If people are worried about you, it only means that they care. So, what do you say... Will you come out to meet us?""

**Brenda..** Go away, you freaks!

**Expert (o.s.)..** Brenda decided not to cooperate with us today. But that doesn't mean the battle is over…

**Clive (to the camera)..** When people, I mean witches, puts up a boundary we need to respect that... 

Rodney nods.

**Clive (cont'd)..** It’s all part of the negotiation. You’ll not get your way every time in trying to help people, but that’s just how it is... We’ll check in on her later.

**Rodney (to the camera)..** You know when people talk about witches, they think they are doing a lot of spells, when in actuality they are more similar to you or me, just a bit delusional. So, they need help, even when they don’t think so…

**Clive (cheerful)..** That’s right!

**Rodney (turns to Clive)..** So, when did you first get into dealing with witches?

**Clive (a bit rehearsed)..** You know… It was not one big thing. My pappy, and his pappy have always had a big heart for this community. 

**Rodney..** Mhm...

**Clive..** They dealt with a lot of different people. When you grow up around that, you start to become familiar with what really goes on in your own neighborhood... 

**Rodney..** You don't say?

**Clive..** I’ve had lots of people cursing me \*laughs\* but my faith has kept me strong. 

Rodney gives off a small fake chuckle. 

Clive then claps him on the shoulder, and Rodney gets a bit uncomfortable by it.

**Clive (turns to the camera)..** Am I a sinner? Yes! So, how am I supposed to judge any witches for what they are doing?

**Rodney..** Right…

**Clive..** I just want to help them.

**Rodney..** Right.

**INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY**

**Expert..** While the boys were away trying to help Brenda, we received an alarming call… A young boy has been seen walking the streets alone in a Pokemon t-shirt. Many callers are now calling in and asking: “Where is his mother?”

**INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY**

**Clive..** See…. This is where it all starts to become interesting. If you don’t know anything about these topics, I wouldn’t blame ya. 

He pulls up a hemp bag and empties it on the table:

A copy of the book Necronomicon.

* A Bob Marley pin with a 'peace' slogan.
* A deck of Tarot cards.
* A licorice lollipop.
* A lipstick.
* A pack of incense with a buddha image.
* A pack of 100% organic tampons.
* A worn paperback of Ethics by Spinoza.
* A key chain with a vampire on it.
* A pack of dog treats.
* A Pokemon plushie.

**Clive (cont'd)..** It's all there... The proof is in the pudding! \*laughs\*

**Rodney..** And that's not a pudding I would eat myself... So why would I think this was okay for anybody else?

**Clive (saddened)..** People get confused and desensitized...

**Rodney..** Right.

Clive goes over the items and picks up the Tarot cards.

**Clive..** You see... Tarot cards bear occult meaning. It doesn’t hold any power in the real world since Christ has arisen. But that does not mean that it doesn’t hold any power on the minds of people, you see? 

He then picks up the Pokemon plushie.

**Clive (cont'd)..** The same is true about Pokemon… It has occult symbolism shaping the minds of our fragile youth.

**Rodney (to the camera)..** Charizard… It looks kind of cool, right? If I were an ignorant kid, I would have no problem thinking this was cool. But hiding behind the curtain, is of course a rather grim reality... I wouldn’t let my kids do drugs… Would you?

**CUT TO BLACK**

**EXT. BRENDA'S HOUSE - DAY**

**Rodney (curious)..** Another mission?

**Clive (ecstatic)..** Yessir!

**Rodney..** It's on?

**Clive..** Oh, it’s on! \*laughs\* Get in the car!

**Rodney..** Yessir...

They walk together back to the car.

**CUT TO BLACK**

**EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY**

**Clive (running)..** Hey, young fella! Where... \*pants\* Where.. Where’s your mother?""

**Adrian (on guard)..** Who are you?

**Clive (Trying to catch his breath)..** My name’s Cli...

**Adrian..** My mom told me not to talk to strange freaks like you!

Rodney interrupts abruptly.

**Rodney (slightly off character)..** That’s a cool Charizard, my dude! Your momma’s right, but we ain’t no freaks. We’re friends with her. So, what’s your name?

**Adrian (more relaxed)..** I’m Adrian!

**Rodney..** That’s a cool name too. Not as cool as Charizard, am I right?

**Adrian..** You like Pokemon too?

**Rodney..** I LOVE Pokemon!

Rodney and Clive look at each other a bit awkwardly.

**Clive (mumbles)..** In Christ.

**Rodney (mumbles)..** In Christ…

**Rodney (cont'd)..** So, what do you say Adrian? Want to go meet your moms?

**Adrian..** Sure!

**Expert (o.s.)..** That looked a lot easier than it should have been. Like I said, once trust is established, resistance disappears.

**INT. CAR - DAY**

**Clive (looks in the rear view mirror)..** So Adrian… Your mom. Does she like gardening by any chance?

**Adrian..** …No?

**Clive..** Not any flowers, or anything like that?

**Adrian..** No! Well, I mean roses... Sometimes.

**Clive..** And is she a smoker?

**Adrian..** Aren’t you friends with her? Shouldn’t you know?

**Rodney (panics)..** No. We’re friends.

**Clive (mumbles to himself)..** In spirit…

**Rodney (cont'd)..** But friends don’t know everything about each other, do they?

**Adrian..** I suppose not…

**Rodney..** So, is she a smoker?

**Adrian..** …Sometimes, I guess.

Rodney and Clive look sternly at each other.

**INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY**

**Expert..** Witches often use botanical supplements to support their witchcraft. Cannabis is a drug that makes your mind more susceptible to delusional thinking, and is commonly used for that reason among witches and warlocks. 

**Clive (to the camera)..** You know... These hippie types and what have you. They say it gives you peace and then they shout for freedom. But I've lived here on earth long enough to say confidently that there is no peace or freedom except through Christ. I mean... That's what we're all here for, right?

**Rodney..** Right... The devil has his tricks.

**Clive..** Oh, the devil has his tricks all right! He tricks your mind into not thinking about what's right \*laughs\*

**Rodney..** You know, there is a good reason why being called a “dopehead” is such an effective stigma. How are you able to function properly, if you are under the influence of drugs?

**Clive..** Sure... Nobody likes being called a ""dopehead""! \*laughs\*

**Rodney..** And nobody really likes using drugs... It's an addiction.

**Clive (a bit sternly)..** And a choice...

**Rodney (a bit concerned)..** Right. An addiction... and a choice.

**Clive (boastful)..** And I've made mine! \*laughs\*

**EXT. ADRIAN'S HOUSE - DAY**

Clive, Rodney and Adrian is walking towards the front door. 

They knock and the door opens. 

Adrian's mother Alice answers the door.

ALICE (30s–40s), calm, self-possessed, warm without inviting intimacy. 

**Alice..** Adrian!

Adrian hugs her.

**Adrian..** Mom!

**Alice..** Who are these people? Are they your friends?

**Clive (greets)..** Ma’am! My name is Clive. Nice to meet you!

**Rodney (greets shortly)..** Nice to meet you. Rodney.

**Clive..** We just found your boy walking the streets and wanted to make sure he got home safe.

**Alice..** …Oh, that’s nice…

**Clive..** I’m a retired police man, you see…

**Alice..** Is that so?

**Clive..** Yes, ma’am. Indeed!

**Alice..** …Well, do you want any coffee?

Clive and Rodney nervously look at each other.

**Clive (hesitant)..** Well…

**Rodney (spontaneous)..** Sure!

**Clive..** I mean, why not? \*laughs\*

**Alice..** Great!

**INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY**

Clive is trying to appear casual as he is scanning the room. 

Adrian doesn't pay any attention as he is playing with his dinosaur toys on the table.

Rodney looks a bit skeptical towards Adrian and the dinosaur toys.

Adrian makes dinosaur noises and it makes Rodney uncomfortable.

Alice comes in the room with coffee.

**Alice..** Here you go… 

She serves them.

**Alice (cont'd)..** You want any sugar?

**Clive (abruptly)..** No! Thank you, though!

**Rodney (uncertain)..** Wha.. What’s in it?

**Alice (looks at him strangely)..** Sugar…

**Rodney..** Sugar. Right…

Rodney looks to Clive, who looks away from him smiling as Alice looks to him as well. 

He makes a small whistle and sips from the coffee.

**Rodney (smiling nervously)..** Sugar. That’s sweet. Sweet of you... Yes. I’d like some sugar please.

Clive drinks his coffee relaxed and confidently. 

Rodney sips nervously, and acts for some parts that he is drinking his coffee.

**Clive..** So, what’s your name sweetheart?

**Alice..** My name is Alice.

**Rodney..** Alice.

**Clive..** That’s a fine name. Where does it come from?

**Alice..** What do you mean?

**Clive..** Is it Belgian, Russian, or anything like that?

**Alice..** I don’t know…

**Clive..** But it’s Christian right?

**Alice (pauses)..** I would think so?

**Clive..** But you’re not a Christian, are you?

**Alice..** What makes you say that?

**Clive..** Well, I mean… I don’t see any Bibles or anything like that.

**Alice..** I like to keep my faith privately.

**Clive..** That…

Rodney chokes his coffee.

**Clive (turns to Rodney in concern)..** Hey... Are you all right?

**Rodney..** No. No. It’s fine. It’s… \*coughs\* 

Alice rushes to get Rodney some paper.

**Rodney..** Thank you! That’s all right. That’s all right.

**Clive (laughs)..** We cough, and we laugh and cry. Inside… We’re all just the same!

**Alice..** That’s very progressive of you! 

Clive nods and smiles and looks towards Rodney.

**Alice..** Are you two in a relationship?

Rodney chokes his coffee again.

**Clive..** No. No! But… I am married to one man.

**Alice..** Is that so?

**Clive..** Yes. And he will never fail me, and I will never fail him, because I love him so!

**Alice..** Oh, that’s really sweet!

**Clive..** Yes. And He takes care of me and all my needs, because he loves me as well... And his name is Jesus!

**Rodney (mumbles)..** Amen.

**Alice..** Oh… That’s nice for you, I suppose.

**Rodney (coughs)..** A-are you a believer?

**Alice..** I believe in many things… And like to keep it that way.

**Clive (hides his uncomfort)..** Ain’t nothing wrong with that! \*laughs\* 

His overconfident laugh settles to the quietness in the room, as they continue to drink their coffee in silence.

**CUT.**

Clive rises up.

**Clive..** Well, thank you for your hospitality regardless. It was good to see that Adrian has a good mom! We’re here if you need anything, all right?

**Alice..** Yes, thank you! It was nice meeting the both of you.

**Rodney..** Yes, thank you.

They awkwardly leave the house in silence and walk back to the car.

**Expert..** After scouting, the boys make their final report.

**Rodney (ecstatic)..** Did you..?

Rodney turns to him looking for an answer. Clive pauses and smiles.

**Clive (enthusiastic)..** Yes!

**Rodney (abruptly)..** She’s a witch!

**Clive (confident)..** A grand master…

1qd7bly,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpatFinance/comments/1qd7bly/living_on_crypto_income_in_the_eu/,Living on crypto income in the EU,"iving entirely on crypto income in the EU sounds liberating until you try paying rent, groceries, or utilities with it. Banks often reject transfers from crypto sources, popular apps like Revolut impose strict limits during volatile periods, and centralized exchanges add delays or high fees that eat into your earnings. For the past six months as an Eastern European freelancer receiving USDT and ETH from web3 clients, I've been piecing together a reliable daily flow that feels more like a normal bank account—complete with SEPA transfers and a virtual card—without constant account flags or waiting games.​

The core challenge is turning volatile crypto payments into stable, spendable EUR that European merchants and landlords accept without questions. Traditional wires through Wise take two to five days and sometimes trigger compliance holds, especially if you're moving €5k or more weekly. Revolut works for small amounts but caps larger ones and occasionally freezes accounts linked to crypto activity. Platforms like Wirex or Trastra offer some crypto support, but their SEPA speeds and IBAN reliability falter under regular use. My current approach starts with swapping incoming USDT straight to an EUR balance, which then feeds a personal IBAN account for instant SEPA transfers—often under a minute to any EU bank—and a virtual card for everyday purchases like coffee or supermarket runs. Keytom became part of this setup after testing others, delivering smooth execution with fees around 0.7 percent total and limits starting at €20k monthly that suit my volume. It handles the handoff without custody risks on the fiat side, making weekly client payouts feel routine rather than a hassle.

This setup lets me cover rent in Berlin one day and groceries in Warsaw the next, all while keeping transaction records clean for potential audits. No more juggling multiple apps or explaining crypto sources to skeptical support teams.

What daily flows work for others living on crypto in the EU? Have you found better IBAN options that play nice with SEPA Instant, or do you stick to pure fiat bridges?",3,1768444257.0,ExpatFinance,1,1.0,False
1qd7bgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/1qd7bgb/cooking_power_usage_is_generally_overestimated/,Cooking power usage is generally overestimated,"I used to rely mainly on a butane camp stove in the van. It's great for boiling water, for cup noodles or instant coffee. I liked it didn't need batteries and was convenient to keep me fed. However, the menu was pretty limited and it got old after a while.

I recently switched to cooking with my power station, and more importantly, to minimize the risk of open flames inside the van. I used to worry about the power consumption, but I realized something: while cooking appliances have a high wattage draw, they run for such a short time that the actual consumption is lower than I expected. e.g. an air fryer (wings/fries) is about 200-250Wh, brewing a pot of coffee is only 40-70Wh, searing a steak on an induction cooktop takes about 180-350Wh, and even using a slow cooker stew takes less than 500Wh.

With my current power setup (a Bluetti Apex 300 2.7kWh power station w/ 350W solar panels), it can cover cooking needs plus run my 12V fridge and other small devices with no issues. The power usage is totally manageable.",11,1768444246.0,vandwellers,5,0.92,False

I was 17. I'd been working at the grocery store for two weeks, stocking shelves from 4pm to midnight after school. $1,100. I'd never seen that much money in my life and I had plans for it. New shoes because mine had holes. Money for senior year stuff. Maybe save some.

He was sitting on the couch when I got home, beer cans already scattered on the coffee table even though it was only 3pm. I made the mistake of being excited. I pulled the check out of my pocket to show mom and he just stood up and grabbed it.

""What are you doing?"" I said.

""You're 17. You live here. That means you pay rent.""

I looked at my mom. She wouldn't even look at me. Just stared at the TV.

""You never said anything about rent. You told me to get a job for my own spending money.""

""Yeah well I'm saying it now. Living here isn't free. You eat our food, use our electric, sleep under our roof."" He was already walking to his room with my check.

I followed him. ""Dad that's my money. I worked for that.""

""And I've worked for 17 years feeding you. Consider it back payment.""

He endorsed my check right there. Signed my name. I watched him do it.

I tried to grab it back and he shoved me into the hallway. Not hard enough to knock me down but hard enough that I stumbled. Then he locked his bedroom door.

I didn't see him the rest of that day. When I came home from school the next day there were scratch-off lottery tickets all over the kitchen table. Maybe 30 or 40 of them. All losers. And a case of beer in the fridge that wasn't there before.

My entire first paycheck. Gone on lottery tickets and beer.

I asked my mom about it and she just said ""your father works hard, he deserves to relax how he wants.""

I was so angry I couldn't even cry. I just went to my room and started planning.

I worked every shift they'd give me. Hid my next three paychecks at school in my locker. Cashed them at the check cashing place and kept the money in my backpack at all times. Slept with my backpack.

My dad asked where my checks were. I told him the store switched to direct deposit and I set it up to go to a savings account. He demanded I give him the account info. I said no. He threatened to kick me out. I said ok.

That night he came into my room at 2am and tore my backpack apart looking for money. Found $340 I'd been too scared to deposit anywhere because I didn't want him to somehow access it. He took it.

""That's what happens when you lie to me,"" he said.

I turned 18 two months later. I'd been sleeping at my friend Sarah's house as much as possible, stashing money at her place. The day after my birthday I took everything I owned that mattered, stuffed it in garbage bags, and Sarah's mom let me move into their guest room.

My mom called me crying saying I was breaking up the family. My dad called me an ungrateful bitch and said I'd come crawling back within a week.

I didn't.

I'm 19 now. I've been out for eight months. I have my own apartment. It's tiny and kind of shitty but it's mine. I pay my own rent. My own electric. My own food.

My dad showed up at my work last week. I saw him walking toward the store and I immediately went to the back room and told my manager I needed her to handle something. She's cool, she knew my situation.

He tried to come to the back anyway and she stopped him. I could hear him through the door saying he just wanted to talk to his daughter, he missed me, family is important.

She told him to leave or she'd call the cops.

He sent me a text an hour later. ""Your mom is sick. She needs help. I can't afford to take care of her alone. You owe us.""

My mom isn't sick. I called her. She's fine. She didn't even know he'd said that.

Now he's telling relatives I abandoned them. That I'm selfish. That they're struggling financially and I won't help even though I'm ""making good money.""

I make $15 an hour. I'm barely covering rent and groceries. I have $200 in savings.

But part of me wonders if he's right. If I should have just dealt with it until I could save more. If I'm being petty holding onto anger about money from when I was 17.

My aunt called me yesterday and said ""he's still your father, you only get one, maybe you should think about forgiveness.""

AITA for refusing to help him now?

Because for three straight days, downtown Jacksonville turns into an early-season college baseball hub: two games a day, big-name programs, and that “baseball is back” energy you can feel even in February.

# Quick facts

*  **When:** **Feb. 20–22, 2026 (Fri–Sun)**
*  **Where:** **VyStar Ballpark** (301 A. Philip Randolph Blvd., Jacksonville, FL 32202)
*  **Format:** **Round-robin**, **two games per day**, each team plays **one game per day**
*  **Teams:** **LSU, UCF, Notre Dame, Indiana**
*  **Times:** Listed in **Eastern** and **subject to change** 

Note on naming: you’ll see it called the **Jacksonville Classic**, **Jax Classic**, or the **Live Like Lou Jax College Baseball Classic** depending on where you’re looking. Same event.

**The 2026 game schedule**

 

*\*all times ET*

**Friday, Feb. 20**

* **LSU vs. Indiana: 2:00 p.m.**
* **UCF vs. Notre Dame: 6:00 p.m.** 

**Saturday, Feb. 21**

* **Notre Dame vs. LSU: 12:00 p.m.**
* **UCF vs. Indiana: 4:00 p.m.** 

**Sunday, Feb. 22**

* **Indiana vs. Notre Dame: 11:00 a.m.**
* **LSU vs. UCF: 3:00 p.m.** 

Six games. Three days. No filler.

**Why this tournament is worth your calendar space**

You’re not committing to a weeklong road trip. You’re not guessing which day the best matchup lands. You get a tight slate; **two games per day**, **round-robin**, and the kind of programs that travel with fans.

And the setting works. VyStar Ballpark sits right in the downtown sports complex, so it’s easy to pair baseball with everything else you want to do in Jax: Riverwalk time, a quick hop to Riverside, or a beach morning before Sunday’s first pitch.

**Tickets: what to buy, and what you actually get**

From the 2026 ticket page, here’s the clean breakdown:

# General Admission (outfield + berm areas)

* **Day Pass: $25**
* **Weekend Pass: $70** 

# Reserved (includes “Dugout Reserved” sections)

* **Dugout Reserved Day Pass: $30**
* **Dugout Reserved Weekend Pass: $85** 

**My practical take:**

*  If you’re doing *one* day, **Day Pass** is a no-brainer—two games for one ticket day.
*  If you’re doing all weekend, the **Weekend Pass** keeps it simple.
*  Want the “I’m here to watch every pitch” vibe? Go **Reserved**. Want to float between shade, snacks, and sunshine? **GA/berm** works. 

**Game-day logistics that save you time**

# 1) Use the right address

Set your GPS to: **301 A. Philip Randolph Blvd., Jacksonville, FL 32202**.

# 2) Parking is plentiful, but price varies by event

The ballpark shares the sports complex parking system—**6,604 on-site spaces** are part of the complex footprint, and pricing depends on the event.

If you’re coming for a weekend pass, I’d treat parking like part of the plan: arrive early on Friday, figure out your preferred lot/garage, then repeat the same move Saturday and Sunday. Less thinking. More baseball.

# 3) Bag policy

You can bring a bag or purse up to **16"" x 16"" x 12""**; hard-sided bags and a bunch of other items are prohibited, and **bags are subject to search**.

My rule: bring a small bag, keep it light, and assume you’ll be asked to open every pocket.

# 4) Directions if you’re driving in

If you’re rolling in from I-10/I-95, the Jumbo Shrimp “getting to the game” directions literally walk you through the exits and turns (Union Street → Arlington Expressway → A. Philip Randolph). Handy when downtown traffic gets… downtown-y.

 

# A simple “do it right” weekend plan

# Friday: arrive, settle in, enjoy the doubleheader

Get downtown early enough to park once, walk around, and be seated before the **2:00 p.m.** start.  
Two games later, you’re done at a reasonable hour—and Jacksonville’s not exactly short on ways to spend an evening.

# Saturday: the “baseball + exploring” day

Saturday’s first pitch is **noon**, so your morning is yours.  
Grab coffee, hit the Riverwalk, then come back for the 1–2 punch.

# Sunday: the early start, then a clean exit

Sunday starts at **11:00 a.m.**, which I love because you can catch a full game and still be on the road (or at the beach) by late afternoon.

# FAQ

**Is it really two games per day?**

I've been sitting on something pretty sweet, and after a lot of internal debate (and maybe a few late-night brainstorming sessions fueled by questionable coffee), I figured it's time to spill the beans. We're talking about scoring some insane deals, seriously – *90% OFF* kind of deals – and how I've been turning that into a decent chunk of change, about $1000 a week, flipping on FBA.

This isn't some magic bullet, but it's a solid strategy I call **Target Clearance Arbitrage**. Ever feel like you're just randomly sifting through clearance racks, hoping for a diamond in the rough? Yeah, I used to do that. It's exhausting and often yields squat. This method is about being *strategic*. It's about knowing *what* to look for, *where* to look, and *when* to snag it before anyone else even realizes it's a gem.

So, how does this even work? It boils down to a few key principles:

*   **Identify ""Hidden Gems"":** This means recognizing products that are *undervalued* in clearance but have a consistent, healthy demand on platforms like Amazon. Think about brands that are popular but maybe have a seasonal dip, or items that are being phased out by a specific retailer but are still hot elsewhere.
*   **Retailer Intel is King:** You need to know *which* stores are most likely to have deep clearance events. We're talking specific retailers that regularly clear out inventory to make space. It’s like being a detective for discounts.
*   **The ""Arbitrage Gap"":** This is the sweet spot. You find an item at a clearance price (ideally 70-90% off retail) that sells for significantly more on Amazon, after accounting for FBA fees and your time. The bigger the gap, the better.
*   **Scalability (The FBA Part):** The beauty of FBA is you can scale this. Once you find a profitable item, you can go back and buy more, and Amazon handles the heavy lifting of storage and shipping. This is where the $1000/week potential really kicks in.

It took me a while to refine this. I made mistakes, bought duds, and had some serious ""oops"" moments. But learning to spot the patterns, understand the demand curves, and leverage those retailer-specific sales? That's been a game-changer. It's about the hunt, the strategy, and ultimately, the profit.

Honestly, the whole process, from spotting the potential to optimizing my FBA listings, is something I've been detailing out. If you're curious to dive deeper into the specifics of identifying these products and building this whole system, you can actually check out a breakdown of how I do it all right here: [https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals
]. It's all the nitty-gritty I've figured out through trial and error.

Yes, I know that’s not heavy. But my stomach area and face holds the same chubby and puffiness to it. I can not shed it. My whole life I was 90-105 pounds so the last few years I gained 10 pounds and it is showing. I personally don’t think my portions are large but I have the same stubborn skinny fat following me everywhere. My diet is pretty much the same everyday:

Breakfast: some kind of egg variation. Hard boiled eggs, an egg wrap, egg frittatas, something similar. I usually pair this with some kind of fruit. A few strawberries, an apple. I will admit coffee with some creamer is my downfall. I drink this daily.

Snack around 10:30ish: some kind of protein yogurt or fruit, if I didn’t have fruit earlier in the day. Sometimes yogurt with fruit inside. Sometimes a cheese stick, or an apple. Something quick and easy.

Lunch: I typically will either have a simple sandwich (turkey, lettuce tomato) or if I’m avoiding carbs, I will do something like grilled chicken  on a bed of lettuce with some light toppings (banana peppers, chick peas, peppers). If I do a side, it’s usually light - hummus with veggies or something.

Post-work snack: either a banana, toast with peanut butter, cheese stick, etc. something to fuel before the gym.

Dinner: depends, but usually  protein with some veggies and some sort of carb. Chicken with potatoes, taco meat with lettuce, chicken cutlets. Sometimes pasta with meat sauce. My portions aren’t anything crazy.

I feel like overall, I’m not overdoing it, but I also am so used to eating in the portions that I do that maybe I am overdoing it without realizing it. If I cut back, I often feel hungry. I work on my feet all day, and go to the gym, and am often light headed if I don’t eat some snacks throughout the day. I don’t always feel super hungry for dinner, but I feel like it’s important after the gym to fuel.

Please help. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong and can’t seem to shed anything. I’m stuck at the same weight, or losing and gaining the same 5 pounds over and over.",0,1768443817.0,WeightLossAdvice,6,0.25,False

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

This strategy detects **fresh crossovers** between the 10-day exponential moving average (EMA10) and the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA30):

  * **Buy Signal (EMA10_x_EMA30_Buy)** : EMA(10) crosses **above** EMA(30) on today's close

    * Short-term momentum overtakes medium-term trend
    * Suggests acceleration in upward price movement
    * Ideal for swing trading (1-4 week holding periods)
  * **Sell Signal (EMA10_x_EMA30_Sell)** : EMA(10) crosses **below** EMA(30) on today's close

    * Short-term momentum weakens below medium-term trend
    * Suggests deceleration or reversal of upward movement
    * Can signal exit points or short entry opportunities



**Key Characteristics:**

  * Uses **two EMAs** (both exponential) for faster response to price changes
  * More responsive than EMA10 x SMA50, generating more frequent signals
  * Better suited for capturing short-to-medium term momentum shifts
  * Higher sensitivity means more signals but also higher whipsaw risk in choppy markets



**Key Criteria:**

  * Buy: EMA10 crosses above EMA30

  * Sell: EMA10 crosses below EMA30

  * Minimum ADV: $40M (liquidity filter)

  * Earnings buffer: 7 days pre/post earnings

  * Fresh crossover: Detected on today's close




**Holding Period:** 1-4 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Medium

## Market Context

The broader market shows mixed performance with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declining modestly by 0.16% and 0.39%, respectively, while the Dow edges higher by 0.13%. This divergence suggests a cautious environment where defensive sectors are gaining traction amid slight pressure on growth-oriented areas. The VIX's 1.59% rise to 16.59 indicates moderately elevated volatility, which can amplify intraday swings for an EMA10/EMA30 crossover strategy. Such conditions heighten the risk of whipsaws, where short-term exponential moving average crossovers may generate false signals in choppy trading, requiring tighter risk management to capture genuine momentum shifts.

Trend direction remains unclear in this low-conviction session, with overall indices hovering near flat, reflecting subdued risk appetite. EMA10/EMA30 signals, totaling 76, thrive in directional moves but face challenges in sideways or rotational markets like today's, potentially leading to reduced signal reliability as traders rotate away from underperformers. The uptick in volatility underscores the need for confirmation from higher timeframes to filter noise and align with prevailing risk-off undertones.

Sector rotation favors Technology as the top performer for these signals, despite Nasdaq weakness, hinting at potential mean-reversion opportunities within the group. However, broader market hesitancy could pressure tech-led crossovers, as capital flows toward steadier areas like those underpinning Dow gains. Traders should monitor for sustained EMA alignment amid rising VIX to avoid overexposure in a rotating landscape.

* * *

## Vlad's Take (EverHint)

**Today's signals:** Strong sector concentration in Technology (18 signals) suggests sector-specific rotation. 4 signals with insider buying adds conviction. 23 signals showing insider selling warrant caution.

**Trading tips for this strategy:**

  * **Entry timing:** Enter on pullback after crossover or at crossover close price
  * **Position sizing:** Start with 2-3% of portfolio per signal (swing trade size)
  * **Stop loss:** Below recent swing low for buys, above recent swing high for sells
  * **Take profit:** 5-10% target for swings, or trail stop at EMA10
  * **Time stop:** Exit if crossover reverses within 1-2 weeks (failed signal)



**Risk warning:** EMA crossovers generate more signals but higher whipsaw risk in ranging markets. Use with trend filter (price vs SMA200)

Loud restaurants felt like torture chambers. Small talk drained me like running a marathon. A single harsh comment could ruin my entire week. Then I discovered the research on high sensitivity, studied the neuroscience behind it, dove into clinical psychology literature, and realized about 20% of us are wired this way. Our nervous systems process information more deeply. It's not weakness; it's biology. But damn, it comes with some exhausting challenges.

Sensory overload isn't just being picky: Your brain is literally processing more stimuli than most people's brains do. Dr. Elaine Aron, the psychologist who pioneered research on highly sensitive people, found that HSPs have increased activation in brain areas related to awareness and emotional processing. That crowded mall isn't just annoying; it's genuinely overwhelming your neural circuitry. The fluorescent lights, competing conversations, and background music it all hits harder. I started using Loop earplugs in overwhelming environments, and they've been a game-changer for managing auditory overload without completely disconnecting.

Criticism cuts deeper than it should: You replay that throwaway comment your manager made for days. Someone gives you constructive feedback, and your brain spirals into catastrophic thinking. This isn't fragility; it's heightened emotional responsiveness. Research shows HSPs have more active mirror neurons and stronger empathetic responses. The book \*\*The Highly Sensitive Person\*\* by Elaine Aron is probably the most validating thing I have ever read. Aron has a PhD from Pacifica Graduate Institute, and her work has shaped how we understand sensitivity as a trait, not a flaw. She explains why criticism activates your threat response more intensely and provides frameworks for building resilience without suppressing your natural wiring. This book will make you question everything you thought you knew about sensitivity being a disadvantage.

You absorb other people's emotions like a sponge. Walk into a room where people just had an argument, and you immediately feel tense. Your friend is stressed, and suddenly you're stressed. It's exhausting being an emotional barometer for everyone around you. Dr. Judith Orloff calls this being an ""empath"" in her work on emotional contagion. Setting boundaries becomes crucial, which honestly took me years to figure out.

Violent or disturbing content stays with you: Everyone else watches that horror movie or true crime documentary fine. You've been having nightmares for weeks. Your brain processes emotional stimuli more thoroughly, so disturbing images and stories get encoded more deeply into memory. I have learned to just skip content that I know will haunt me. Not worth it.

Decision-making feels impossibly hard: Choosing a restaurant for dinner shouldn't take 45 minutes, but you're considering every possible outcome and everyone's preferences, and what if you pick wrong and people are disappointed. Analysis paralysis is real when your brain naturally considers more variables and potential consequences than others do.

You need way more downtime than most people: After socializing, working, or even doing fun activities, you are completely drained. People think you're antisocial or boring. You're not; you just process experiences more intensively, so they're more depleting. The app \*\****Finch***\*\* has been helpful for building in recovery time as an actual habit, not something to feel guilty about. It's a self-care app that gamifies taking care of yourself, which sounds silly but actually works for making downtime feel productive rather than lazy.

For anyone looking to understand this trait more systematically, there's an AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology research, expert insights, and books on emotional sensitivity to create personalized audio content. You can set a goal like ""thrive as a highly sensitive person,"" and it generates an adaptive learning plan with podcasts drawn from clinical psychology sources and HSP research. The depth is customizable, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples and coping strategies. It connects knowledge from books like Aron's work, neuroscience studies on sensory processing, and practical frameworks for managing overstimulation into one structured path.

Caffeine and alcohol hit you like a freight train: Half a coffee and you're jittery for hours. Two drinks and you're done for the night. HSPs often have increased sensitivity to substances because of how our nervous systems process stimulation. It's not about tolerance or being lightweight; it's neurological.

You can't do small talk without wanting to escape: Surface-level conversations feel physically uncomfortable. You crave depth and meaning in interactions. Dr. Aron's research shows HSPs naturally gravitate toward processing meaning and significance rather than superficial information. This makes networking events actual hell.

Strong smells are genuinely distressing: Someone's perfume in the elevator isn't just unpleasant; it's nauseating. You can smell things others don't even notice. Scent sensitivity is part of the sensory processing differences in HSPs. I've started being upfront about fragrance sensitivities rather than suffering in silence.



\*\*You notice everything, all the time\*\*. That picture frame is slightly crooked. Your coworker's tone was different today. The lighting in this room feels wrong. Your brain is constantly scanning for subtleties and patterns that others miss. This can be an asset in creative work but exhausting in daily life.



\*\*Deadlines and time pressure feel crushing\*\*. You work better with spaciousness and the ability to process thoroughly. Rush jobs make you shut down because your brain needs time to work through information deeply. The podcast \*\*The One You Feed\*\* has great episodes on working with your natural rhythms instead of forcing yourself into neurotypical productivity models. It's hosted by Eric Zimmer, who interviews psychologists, researchers, and authors about managing life's challenges.

You take everything personally, even when you know you shouldn't: Someone cancels plans, and your brain immediately goes to ""they hate me."" A friend seems distant, and you've obviously done something wrong. Your emotional responsiveness makes neutral situations feel loaded. Learning to reality-check these thoughts has been ongoing work.

Busy, chaotic environments make you want to crawl out of your skin: Open-plan offices are your nightmare. Constant stimulation without breaks for processing makes you feel frazzled and on edge. You're not being dramatic; your nervous system is literally overwhelmed.

The research is clear: high sensitivity is a neurological trait, not a personality flaw or something you need to fix. About 100 other species show this same trait variation; it's evolutionarily advantageous to have some population members who notice threats and subtleties others miss. But modern life, with its constant stimulation and glorification of extroversion, wasn't built for sensitive nervous systems. Understanding the biology behind it helps, but the real work is learning to structure your life around your actual needs instead of pretending you're wired like everyone else. That means saying no more, taking breaks without guilt, choosing environments carefully, and accepting that your version of thriving looks different. Not worse, not less ambitious, just different.",1,1768442674.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

1qd6lms,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1qd6lms/are_my_wifes_symptoms_bpd_or_something_else/,Are my wife’s symptoms BPD or something else?,"Hello all, during the past two months my marital situation has been turned upside down and although I am familiar with BPD, I wanted to ask those who have experienced it themselves or have a loved one with BPD. 

I am sorry for the really really long text, but in order to give the most accurate picture, I decided to include everything even if it may not be pertinent. I thank anyone who takes the time to read and offer input. 

A little background which may or may not be pertinent as I am not sure: We have been married for roughly 8 years, no children. Both come from the same Eastern European background. While I am born and raised in the US, she was born there, and currently has both parents and a sibling there. We both have fairly large, close-knit families and she is extremely close with her brother (close in age) and her father, usually FaceTiming multiple days a week, if not daily. We both have college degrees and are fortunate enough financially where she is able ti go back and visit whenever she feels like it, and we are able to live comfortably. As a result, I have always supported whatever career path she wanted to take and if she wanted to be a homemaker, I was supportive of that as well. Whatever made her happy. 

For the most part we treat each other with kindness and respect. There has never been abuse from one to another in any form and never a hint of infidelity. 

However, a little over two years ago, I noticed a shift in behavior in her personality and how she normally was. I am not sure what the onset of symptoms are for BPD and how early they may develop. Once an extremely private person, she began to be excessively open to people outside of our normal circle of trust which only recently I found out.  Had I even once mentioned what we had for dinner to someone before would make her have the privacy chat with me. 

Not only was she open with regular things she previously kept private, it became apparent that she began to discuss our lives as a couple to people I would not expect her to; ex. A neighbor couple we hang out with once in a while. 

She also began to start recollecting on her childhood back home and how although financially ok and grew up in a well to do family, she was forced to work in the family business on weekends and summers starting at around 12yo. She also began to bring up two very specific instances which happened during the time she first moved to my area, which she eventually stated she would never forget and could maybe even never forgive me for. Although seemingly small issues to me, I did not discredit her feelings of hurt and profusely apologized for the hurt I had caused. 

The two specific instances were the following: When she first moved with me and didn’t have a car, one day she wanted to go to a nearby store and I was unable to take her. As a result, she walked 15 minutes to the store by herself. She continually asked how I could have let her walk by herself at such a young age at the time (early 20s) even though we live in one of the safest and family friendly areas of the country. The second instance was when I had taken her to Target when she first came to do some household shopping and while there, I mentioned that once in a while I would be clothes from there like Tshirts and boxers. For whatever reason, she took this as me telling her my young fiancee at the time, to do her clothes shopping at Target instead of somewhere at the mall I guess. 

Now of course these instances can be somewhat immature and shouldn’t cause a major issue, and that wasn’t the core problem that began. The issue was that her mind wouldn’t allow her to essentially forget and forgive about these seemingly trivial instances that caused so much hurt even after profusely apologizing and acknowledging her pain. 

During this time, she had an extremely hard time every apologizing, even for small things. For some reason, she built up an ego and began viewing the idea of apologizing for literally anything a sign of weakness and she felt she was above that. Essentially, her ego and pride stood in the way of logic and reason. Additionally, she began to state that she didn’t need anyone and could handle life by herself, independently. As I reminded her that everyone needs someone at some point, especially spouses, she never had to be solo as I would always be at her side. She further stated that she was going to start living life on her own terms and not by what other people deemed right or let what other people think/say affect how she lives. 


This continued until the very last day where after having a brief argument the night before, followed by a relaxing night of watching tv and chatting a bit, I woke up to no wife. Apparently she had called a family member and told them she was leaving. After a day of no contact and being blocked, I found out she was staying at an AirBnB and after a few days, she agreed to meet for coffee to discuss the current issue. She refused to come home and said she needed space to clear her head, which I said was no problem. After another few days of no contact, she agreed to come over for dinner, which she continued to do for several days. However, each time I noticed that while everything seemed to be going well while spending time together, if I brought up the situation at hand and how to resolve it, she would become extremely irritated, jump up and leave. It was as though the pressure of being asked to discuss anything serious was triggering her. 

As the holidays were approaching and she did not have anywhere to go, I decided to decline any invitations myself and instead convinced her to come over for Xmas eve, where we had a great time, spent time together until early morning when she left to go to the AirBnB. She mentioned that she would think about coming home. However, during consecutive days, any time I asked her if she decided, she would again become irritable and explode, stopping all contact for a few days, until she would eventually calm down and be able to speak. This pattern went on and off for several days. 

Suddenly, a few days after Xmas, which we both enjoyed, I was served with divorce papers. I was completely shocked.  When I asked her about it, she went on a tirade of how I never supported her, how she was abandoned, and how she felt she wasted her youth. After explaining all of the ways which I unconditionally loved and supported her in all aspects of life, she began to cool down then a day or two after, again went on a tirade, bringing up the two instances from early on in our relationship. 

During this time, I asked her if she had told her family back at home at what was happening, and she stated she did and they knew about everything, but I found it weird that neither of them called me directly to ask about what was going on, as we are very close. 

As NYE approached, she continued to be stabdoffish and refused to spend any time together. Knowing that she always hated NYE, I did my best to try to get her to come celebrate at home so she wasn’t alone. After multiple attempts of asking and her refusing, I gave up as to not pressure her or cause any further issues. It was the. That she said she would stop by for a bit. A bit turned into 730Am and breakfast. She said she felt good and or the first time in a while, I felt as though I had the woman I had fallen in love with back. I prayed it would be smooth sailing from there. 

Well…after calling to check up on her less than 12 hours after, she angrily answered the phone. When I asked what was wrong, she stated that she has heard from someone that she should not be coming over to our house to spend time with me so she wasn’t going to and she would not be coming over anymore. At a shock again at how it could go from great to terrible so quickly, I reminded her that she wanted to live life according to her own terms and not by what other people expected or said. By “hearing” someone say she shouldn’t be coming over anymore and her not doing so meant she was doing exactly what others had said or expected. She should do whatever she felt was right and comfortable for her. 

From that point forward, she began to become more standoffish and each time I would even text to check up on her felt like it was extreme pressure, eventually leading to her blocking me for days at a time. Finally, after trying to convince her to meet somewhere to chat, she became the most irritable I had ever experienced, cutting off all contact. 

A few days later, I call my BIL and after a bit began to discuss what was happening.  Was shocked to find out that neither him, my father in law or mother in law knew what was happening. When they called to ask her if she’s ok and if she needed anything, suddenly both her brother and father were blocked and continue to be blocked until now. Now in the loop of what was occurring with their daughter and I, they kept in constant contact with me. A few days after,  I receive a notification of an unusually charge on our card. Going through it, I notice there was a charge for an airline that was the major carrier of where her parents lived back home. Further, I see multiple charges of purchases totaling in the thousands, which she would have never come close to before. 

Since I was still blocked, I decided to send an email to ask if she was ok and whether she was traveling. After a day she responded saying that yes she did an mentioned that she had taken medical leave off of work. Answers were short and no information as to when she went or when she would return was given. 

When I mentioned this to her parents, I believed they were already aware. Apparently, they have not been, as she did not tell them she was back home. After another email, she mentioned that she refused to visit her family, and actually unblocked her father to txt him that she was back at home but refuses to see any of them as to her they no longer exist. 

Shoe only making contact with her mother, she has been  ok been speaking angrily and at times spoke so fast and loudly screaming that my MIL stated she could not understand what she was saying. 

As of today, all I know is that she is still back home and has not seen her family, but after briefly speaking to her brother through a mutual girlfriend, she stated that she did not want to see them as she “heard” that her brother and I have been gossiping about her, which of course was and is not the case. 

Now I am no expert but did some extensive reading on this sub. Where some parts of others experiences are similar, some are also way off and I wanted to get any input from fresh eyes as to what this may be and how I and her family may help her. Currently, I am not worried about my marriage and if she does want to divorce, I love her enough to respect her decision. My main concern is her well being and the current geographical distance between us hurts my heart as there is very little I can do to help from so far away. I am more than willing to travel if need be, but at the same time do not want to make it seem as though I am pressuring her or make her feel uncomfortable in any way. 

I am at a loss for words and am trying to figure out what the underlying cause of this may be. Any input would be appreciated more than I can acknowledge here. ",1,1768442331.0,BipolarSOs,2,1.0,False

I’m from a really gloomy rainy city + I’m aiming to escape that, so Kaohsiung seems the better option, however I’m worried I’ll get bored or not be able to make friends as easily as Taipei.

I only spent 3 days in Kaohsiung and liked it equally to Taipei, however I obviously didn’t get to see too much of the city in comparison.

I can afford both cities however I’m aiming to save for some travels after.

I enjoy a good balance of nightlife/socialising and nature/alone time however I love living life slow paced. I’m also a creative person and an artist and would love to strengthen my connections in that area too. I love the beach lol so Kaohsiung sounds amazing for that.

I will be landing in Taiwan with very VERY limited Chinese if that helps. 🥲

I sat on the edge of a leather couch, the ocean swaying the yacht gently. I clasped my hands and leaned forward.

“So, when do I get to know what I’m reviewing?” I asked to the well-dressed man that sat across from me. His name was Michael Sorata. He wore a blue three-piece suit, contrasted by a Cubs baseball cap, with a gold studded cane rested across his lap.

“You’ll figure it out.” he replied bluntly. “But it will be worth your time, I can promise that.” He gave me a sleazy smirk. I leaned back and glanced over my shoulder, out the window. Michael spoke again. “We expect that it won’t take too long, couple days max. The engineers we’ve hired have done an immaculate job and it should be able to hold them in.” I looked back at him and furrowed my brow.

“Them?” I once again leaned forward, waiting for him to elaborate. Irritatingly he did not. Instead he just looked at me blankly for a few moments before slapping his thighs and standing, holding his cane to his side.

“Well, I’m going to get some fresh air. Feel free to help yourself to anything on the boat. While you’re a guest of Genesis, you’re able to do anything.” He gave me a wink, motioning at the heavily stocked bar and then exited out onto the deck. I stood and smoothed out my creased jeans. I walked over to the bar and looked through the glass cabinets, picking out a fancy wine. I looked over at the wine glasses before popping the cork from the bottle and taking a swig. I wiped my lips and set the bottle down on a polished marble counter. The ship tilted, sending the bottle over the edge of the counter and smashing on the wooden floor.

“Ah, fuck.” I muttered. I looked around for some paper towels before deciding to just let some poor deckhand clean it up. They’d find it eventually. I followed Michael out onto the deck and looked out at the sea. We were off the coast of West Africa, sailing to an island called São Tomé. I wasn’t exactly sure why I was invited to inspect a research station by Genesis, a company renowned for its widely successful treatments against previously incurable diseases, but I figured they must have been having some trouble with engineering. Probably something to do with me being a career engineer. I heard someone walking towards me and turned to face them. It was a burly man with a security vest on. He had a large, visually modified cattle prod on his left hip and a pistol on his right. He passed me and started to converse with Michael, who stood at the bow. I walked up a flight of stairs to my room and turned in until we reached land.

I woke to the sound of knocking. I swung the door open just as the timid deckhand went to knock again. We looked at each other awkwardly for a moment before he spoke.

""Hey mister Angioti. We're about to pull into the dock, so mister Sorata asked me to fetch you."" He turned to lead me off the boat.

""Hold on, just let me grab my things."" I said. He looked back at me.

""No need. Someone will come get them for you shortly, mister Angioti."" He walked towards the gangway and I followed closely behind. My feet hit concrete as I stepped onto the pier. I looked around the large dock and noticed tens of Genesis signs. Michael stood before me beside a man wearing slacks with a plaid checkered shirt. He was a big man and had an arrogant look plastered on his face. He stepped forward and offered his hand.

""I take it you're the reviewer? Name's Steve Hardy. I overlook the engineering here."" He had an Australian accent. I shook his hand.

""Bill Angioti.""

""Good to meet you Bill. Y'know what's going on here?""

""Yeah, you guys want me to take a look at something right?""

""Well, yeah, but,"" he paused and narrowed his eyes slightly, biting his lip. He leaned in to Michael and whispered something to him. Michael shook his head slightly. Steve clapped his hands together. ""Well, let's get going. Michael's going back to the mainland so you might not see him again. Don't worry, you're in good hands.""

As he said it, Michaels jaw clenched ever so slightly as he looked past me, out at the sea. He waved over two armed men. ""Goddamned spy's back out at sea. Get some guys on it, now,"" he told them. ""And use X9 stimulant, not the X1, otherwise he'll never wake up."" The men nodded and jogged to the other side of the dock, where a large patrol boat was waiting. There was a large machine mounted on the front that looked like a huge spear gun. They called over to a group of people that were playing cards around the boat, who picked up firearms and ran onto the ship. Curiously, although they each held assorted rifles and submachine guns, they all had a cattle prod on their hip. Michael cleared his throat. ""Well, I guess I won't be leaving just yet. Somethings just come up. I will be heading up to the lodge, so I still likely won't see you until later, but if you need me just give me a call. You should have unlimited data, so don't think twice about contacting me. I trust you have my details?""

""Yeah, they were on the contract you had me sign."" I replied. Michael clasped his hands together.

""Amazing. I will see you fine gentlemen later."" He turned and walked to the other side of the dock, where a black limousine sat. The windows were tinted, but I could still make out the metal bars that were on the inside. They looked almost like prison windows. While I was watching him leave, a dark green jeep pulled up next to us. The window rolled down and I saw a black man with aviators wearing a tan Genesis cap looking at Steve.

""Sorry im late. One of the damn birds tried getting off with my gun, so I had to get one of the guys to taze it."" He said. He sounded tense. ""There's a problem with the walls on E3, so we'll need to get there now."" He looked at me. ""We'll be going there now, sorry. I'll tell someone to take your bags to the hotel."" Steve got in the passenger seat and I followed suit, getting in the back of the jeep. I learned that the driver's name was David, an animal handler, and he was a veteran who served in Iraq.

""So what is E3?"" I asked him, looking for a way to pry something about what I was doing here.

""Its an enclosure. We have twelve of them, and usually they're all in perfect nick. Lucky you came today, because this is the first time in three years we've had any problems. We've sedated everything in it, so don't worry about that.""

I paused. ""What's in it?"" Steve chipped in, side-eying David.

""Just a few flightless birds. Genesis is taking a swing at some, uh, de-extinction of animals. You know what a Moa is?""

I shook my head.

""Well, its a big old thing that was native to New Zealand. Kind of like an emu or an ostrich. That's one of the things in E3. They aren't very dangerous, but we just don't want them escaping so we sedated them.""

""Well, what's the problem with the fence?"" David bit his lip while Steve continued to speak.

""Big old tree smashed down on the fence last night during a windstorm. Figured that you should come down and give us advice on how to reinforce the fences and stop it happening again."" I sat back in my seat and watched the jungle pass as rain began to fall against the windows.

After about twenty minutes of driving, it came into view. The fence loomed ahead, metal bars glinting in the rain, humming faintly with electricity. Something about it didn’t make sense for just a few flightless birds. I saw a sign hanging from one of the bars that read

DANGER 12500 VOLTS

""Hey, what're the big fences for?"" I asked. ""Keep poachers out."" Steve replied. It wasnt a satisfying answer, but I could tell I wasnt going to get anything else out of him. I guess Genesis had money to just throw at this place.

Another ten minutes passed and the destroyed section of fence came into view. Dozens of people in overalls worked on cutting broken struts and replacing them with fresh ones. There were two large cranes that were set up, obviously needed to move the huge tree off of the fence. As we pulled up next to the workers, I noticed something. About ten of the men weren't workers at all, but more security guards. They all seemed uneasy, keeping their hands on their guns at all times. The workers all seemed even more anxiety filled. They never turned their back to the enclosure, never moved past the fence and their eyes darted around the foliage.

""What's everyone so scared of?"" I asked Steve.

""Well, y'know, jungle legends 'n' shit. The workers are native to the island and they've convinced half the staff here of their little myths. Real annoying for trying to get anything done, but these guys work like animals."" He said with a slight laugh.

""Judging by the damage id say we'll be here about four or five hours, so you'll get a bit of a look at how things work here."" I stepped out of the jeep and was hit by the humidity of the jungle. It was almost overpowering, and felt like a different country compared to the cool breeze at the dock. into the light rain and walked over to the fence. It looked like it could keep about anything in. I noticed an absence of any vehicles, aside from the trucks that carried the cranes.

""Hey, where are all the cars at?"" I called back to Steve.

""What cars?""

""The cars these guys use to get around."" Steve laughed

""They walk to and from the main facility"" I raised an eyebrow

""Really? Why?'

""Gotta keep costs down somehow"" he said, tapping his temple. They had to keep costs down by not providing transport to their workers when they could afford huge, electric fences to protect birds? I shook my head. Damn corporate Suits.

Steve wasn't lying when he said it would take a few hours. It was just about dusk when we got back into the jeep, despite the fact that the fence wasn't fully repaired yet. I was shocked at the conditions that the contractors worked through. Steve was right, they worked like animals. David was pretty reckless with his driving to the main station. On the journey to the worksite, we'd been driving about seventy kilometers an hour, already a bit fast for the narrow corners and bumpy terrain. Now we were hitting almost ninety. He wove around trees like he was a rally driver, and his eyes kept flicking to the rear view mirror. The rain had slowly turned into a downpour over the past hour, and the dirt path was turning to mud. Suddenly a shadowed figure leapt across the road in front of us and David slammed on the brakes. Steve's hand went to his hip, resting on his prod, before moving to the handgun that sat on the dashboard.

""Shit."" David mumbled under his breath. He leaned into the jeeps radio. ""One out by..."" he looked at Steve.

""E10"" said Steve, who was opening the glove box and retrieving a rail-mounted flashlight, attaching it to the bottom of his pistol and winding down the window to illuminate the wet jungle. David continued speaking into the radio.

""One out by E10. Check the map, the log, everything. Gonna need a team down here in the morning. Conditions are too harsh tonight."" He put the jeep back into gear and sped up the path again. The interaction left me unnerved. I had talked to some of the contractors while we were working, and some of them had interesting things to say. They told me stories of terrible animals that would stalk you through the jungle and then, the instant you looked away, they would pounce. Maybe, just maybe, I was starting to believe them. Just then, there was a low rumbling cry in the distance, almost like a foghorn. I felt it resonate in my chest, and it drove a chill down my spine. I felt my heart beating prominently in my chest, before I noticed David's hands whiten as they tightened slightly on the wheel, and his foot pressed even harder on the accelerator. Steve wound up his window.

When we finally got to the facility, I was stunned to find a heavy gate in front of it. The fence it was attached to was even heavier than the ones surrounding the enclosures. They seemed more akin to the outer layer of a fortress, and this idea was accompanied by the watchtower that loomed above us, harbouring spotlights that lit up the road and surrounding jungle.

We pulled up next to a camera and after a moment or two the gate slowly swung open and we drove inside. A humongous building lay before us, looking more like a mall than a research station. Hundreds of cars were parked inside of the fence, along with tens of trucks parked beside a loading bay along an offshoot of the building. Michael was standing on his own beneath the overhang, the only person outside amidst the pelting rain and chilly temperatures.

We left the jeep in the parking zone and walked to meet him. He held his arms wide, still holding his cane. I hadn't actually seen him use it much, so I figured it was more for show than for actual use. ""So glad you finally made it. How did the job go?""

Steve grunted. ""Still going, but its fine.""

""Good, good.""

""I'll leave Bill with you. I'm sure he's tired."" Steve said, already walking into the building with David behind him. Michael beckoned me forwards as he too walked inside. As soon as I walked through the door, hundreds of people surrounded me. We walked through the lobby and into a humongous chamber, with a large digital map on an oval table in the center of it all.

""Welcome to the conference room."" He said with a grand flourish of his arms. There were only a couple people here, most had signed out for the night, and Michael said a quick hello to them. ""This is a map of the whole facility, including all of the enclosures."" Michael told me proudly. ""We spare no expense on the grandeur of our creation."" In each enclosure there were a series of red dots. They were all static and had tags, usually a letter and then a number. I guessed it was the name and tag of animals. Michael hit a buzzer on the table and a teenager came in. ""Dylan, get me a coffee and a donut please."" He turned to me. ""You want anything, Bill? You can get anything you'd like.""

""Uh, sure, a banana milkshake sounds good."" Michael turned and waved away the kid. I looked back at the map and noticed that there was a small cluster of blue dots on the edge of Enclosure Three, and there were three larger red dots within the fences. I looked up at Michael, who was busy talking in a hushed tone with the other people in the room. ""Hey, Mike-'

""Michael."" He said, with a hint of strange pleasure. ""Please call me Michael. What can I do you for?"" He smiled.

""Why are these three dots moving?"" He came over and studied the map. The dots moved towards the hole in the fence. He furrowed his brow and bit his lip.

""Just stay here a moment."" He walked quickly back to the others and turned away from me, saying something to them. I didnt catch it all. ""Yeah...issue...no, no...it'll be fine...guns ready...alright."" He turned back to me and smiled again as one of the people he had talked to produced a cell phone from her pocket and spoke into it. ""Those dots are assets. Must have woken up and are trying to see what all the fuss is about. Dont want them escaping so I've told the guys to sedate them again.""

He led me out of the conference room and led me up a flight of stairs to a deserted hallway. ""Here are the guest rooms. You'll be in the one at the end, so make yourself comfortable. I sent some people to retrieve your things earlier, so just tell me if anything is missing. Have a good night, Bill."" He said with a friendly smile before turning on his heels and strutting away.

The night passed in the blink of an eye, and I was called down to the lobby. Michael meets me once more, dressed in a different golden three piece suit, this time with a man in all black wearing shades. I thought he looked a bit stupid wearing them inside, but who was I to judge. ""This is Elias. He's the head of security here. We'll be showing you through some of our protocols and systems today, so just follow us."" They led me through an abundance of rooms, the building seeming to stretch on and on, before we entered the security headquarters. Just in this room alone there was easily two hundred people. They were all relaxed, lounging at desks behind monitors that showed assorted cameras and layouts.

Plastered on the wall most noticeably was a large screen, split up into three parts. One third was a conglomerate of about fifteen different people's faces and names, another was full of cameras that showed a boat at sea, and the last showed a radar. I stared at the screen while Elias and Michael were talking to some of the security team. I frowned. The radar showed two green dots. One, at the center, was obviously the boat, which was the same one I had seen in the port yesterday. But there was another dot on it too, right next to the boat. I looked back and forth, but none of the cameras were showing anything else. Then I noticed a smaller screen, one that had only a few words on it, perched above a picture.

UNDERGOING RECONTAINMENT ASSET 105 - SPINO

The picture was of a large animal, with a weird shape to it. It had a long snout, like that of a crocodile, and an even longer tail. But most peculiarly, it looked like it had a hand-fan perched on its back. I looked back to the cameras, which showed a spiny sail breaching the surface, of the ocean causing a wave of water to splash onto the boats deck. I could hear shouting through the speakers as the crew of the ship all started moving at once. The security headquarters went deadly quiet as people anticipated what came next. On the screen I saw handguns being drawn and launchers being brought out from the inside of the ship. Suddenly the room was alive once more, people shouting to each other and running to and fro. Michael grabbed me and began to push me out of the room while Elias ran to a control panel. My eyes remained glued to the cameras. One man ran to the mounted harpoon gun and began to aim it at the beast. As he did, it smashed its huge body against the boat, sending it rocking. The man lost his foothold on the slippery deck and tumbled over the guardrail and into the water, and then the door closed and I could see no more.",2,1768442092.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

1qd6i0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qd6i0x/emilia_wasnt_crazy/,Emilia wasn't crazy,"When the police took her away on that cold and windy December night, I knew my best friend was completely gone. But I was sure that she wasn’t always like this.

Our neighborhood was small and everyone knew each other when Emilia and her parents moved in 10 years ago. They bought the 2-story house next to my parents’. It was just the usual suburban house painted white, with fences, a backyard and a front lawn.

I liked Emilia almost immediately. In my 5-year-old brain, she was the prettiest girl in the whole neighborhood, even prettier than Marie from the house opposite to mine. She had blonde hair, light-brown eyes and a smile that just lit up her surroundings. The first time I saw her, she had on a white T-shirt and a blue skirt with white polka dots. Her family had just arrived and she got out of the Toyota, holding a ball that was as large as her face. Before I could steal another look, her parents had hurried her into the house.

I didn’t get to know her name until 2 weeks later. I was excluded from the soccer game of the boys in the neighborhood and was sitting at the front lawn to my house when she came and sat next to me.

“Can I sit here?” she asked in a soft voice.

I was so shy my face felt hot. I stammered a “yes” before turning my eyes to the game.

“Why aren’t you playing?”

“They don’t want me, I’m too short.”

“What’s your name by the way?”

“Tim. What’s yours?”

“I’m Emilia. Tim, you wanna go and ask them again?”

I didn’t even get a chance to say no before Emilia dragged me by the arms to the group of boys playing. I still remember Hughes - the biggest boy of the bunch, staring Emilia down, but she stood her ground and he looked away in embarrassment. That afternoon we got to play soccer.

Emilia was popular throughout elementary school. She was athletic, pretty and smart. She got good grades and was always the teachers’ favorite. She got taller and prettier while I was a scrawny kid that barely passed most subjects. We couldn’t be more different. But somehow, we were still friends.

When we were 8, Emilia got a little puppy named Bob. Bob was a quirky golden retriever that loved humans and chasing his own tail. We immediately became a trio. Me, Mia – she liked to be called this, and Bob would often explore the thin woods around our neighborhood after school. On one day like that, we were playing by a small stream. I was walking over a dead log that acted like a bridge between the banks and slipped. I hit my ankle on some rocks and a dull pain flared up in my left leg.  I tried to stand up but my ankle couldn’t take any pressure and soon I slipped into the stream, the water wetting my entire lower half. Mia appeared then, the light shining down and around her, forming a silver lining. She held out her hand and dragged me out of the stream. She found a dead branch nearby, broke it to size and told me to lean on it. Bob was fluttering around us both and he gave my ankle a good lick. I thanked her and turned away to hide my blushing. We headed home but made it half-way before the branch broke. Mia took my arm around her shoulder and helped me home.

“I think I can walk home, it only hurts a little” I told her.

“You can lean on me, that looks like it hurts a lot. We’re besties now, you can depend on me you know. And I’ll depend on you,” she replied. At that moment, my aching ankle and stinging scrapes felt like they didn’t hurt at all. The warm summer sun shone down on us and the air smelled of old wood and warm grass. The road home was quiet, save for the panting of Bob and the sound of our shoes on the concrete.

High school came in a hurry. Before we knew it, we were in different classes already. Mia made captain of the girls’ soccer team and was consistently one of the top students at our school. As for me, I found my passion in English literature as was still largely the same kid that was rejected from soccer, though I started to grow taller than her.

That was around the time when my sleeping problem started. I often went to bed at 11 P.M, a habit that I had since starting primary school. I would read a chapter or two from my favorite book and then hit the bed soon after. But for some reason, things started to change. I would sit at my desk and invariably start to fall asleep at around half past 10. I wasn’t the only one. My parents talked to each other about how they often fall asleep around that time too. My dad was in the middle of filing our taxes one night and just fell asleep right at his desk. My mother would sleep midway through her nightly care routine. We eventually chalked it up to seasonal temperature changes and adjusted our routine to finish sooner.

My family wasn’t the only one. When I went to Mia's house to do homework with her, she talked about how her entire family started to fall asleep at the same time too.

“It’s just seasonal weather. My family got that too, we just adjusted our routines to finish up the night sooner,” I told her.

“Guess so. Is it bed bug season too because I just got this,” she showed me her arm. There were several small marks around the vein in her inner elbow, the vein that doctors often inject into. They were very small and hard to see unless one got close. I said nothing and just finished my homework with her.

Then the dreams started. I didn’t remember any of them at first. But gradually, I started to recall one or two familiar details from my dream during recess or sometimes, during class when the lessons get too hard. Then eventually I started to remember a lot of details from my dreams.

At school, things weren’t looking much better. Mia got in the eyes of the boys from both the soccer and other sport teams. She had to turn down love letters, surprise flowers and outright confessions. Because we were best friends, I’m often the deliverer of these confessions and often the first person to see the tired and exasperated look on her face when she had to turn down the love confession of the week. That also meant that I was occasionally hazed, especially by the boys from the soccer and football team. They would yell out slurs, push me into my locker or trip me during lunch break. It got so bad that Mia had to tell off a couple of the boys to leave me alone or she would get a teacher involved.

Our trips to the forests near our neighborhood started to become less and less frequent. We were both busy with schoolwork and our own hobbies. But we still visited each other’s house to do homework and talked about life at school.

Then one day, Mia knocked the door to my house, tears in her eyes and blood on her hands. I immediately ran to her, afraid that she was wounded. There was so much blood.

“What happened? Are you hurt? Why is there so much blood?” I asked her and lifted her arms to search around her for an open wound. Then it hit me that we were no longer kids and that what I was doing was overstepping certain boundaries.

Just then, she pushed her face into my chest. I felt her warm tears flow down my T-shirt. Unconsciously, my arms wrapped around her and hugged her. Mia took a while but eventually calmed down. She told me that Bob was hit by a speeding car as they were crossing a road and the wheels of the car tore through his body, opening his stomach. Mia carried Bob all the way home before he died in her arms.

We buried Bob in a spot below the shade of the apple tree in her backyard. I sat with Mia that entire afternoon trying to console her.

Two weeks later, Mia told me that she and her mom were going to volunteer for an animal shelter. She would also try out a vegetarian diet. “I don’t want to cause more suffering” she told me.

Around fall, our neighborhood took part in a study about sleep. The scientists said it was a longitudinal study on the effects of nature on our sleep pattern. We were considered one of the prime locations for good sleep, due to the surrounding woods, the fresh air and lack of noise pollution. We would measure the time that we slept and do a self-report on the sleep quality and what we experienced. The whole neighborhood was excited. That study was probably the most attention we got in decades.

Then the dreams got worse. They became violent and at times, hyper realistic. I could even control how I acted in the dreams and would sometime confuse between dreaming and reality. Mia had the same problems, but it seemed she had it much worse than I do. She talked about her dreams in vivid details, about how some days, she dreamed that her hands were all red with blood. Losing Bob must have really gotten to her. She started to have this really tired look on her face and her grades started to tank. Her parents wanted to put her through therapy, but Mia wouldn’t have it. “I didn’t want to feel like a lab rat,” she said. The bed bug bites were getting worse too, now there were nearly a dozen small dots on her arm.

There was another problem, of course. I realized that I liked Mia. No, I loved her. It came in the form of flutters every time we sat together. That desire for her to rest her head on my shoulder when we talked about our problems, that strong urge to hold her hand when we were out in public. But I didn’t dare to say anything. What we had was beautiful, I was afraid that if I opened my mouth, I would ruin everything. So I kept my love hidden. Every time I saw a boy tell Mia how much he liked her, every time she opened her locker to flowers and love letters, my heart sank a little, afraid that she would one day say yes.

After all the emotional torment, our family and Mia’s decided to have a trip together. One of the her relatives had several family-sized cabins right next to a secluded spot in Lake Willoughby. We rented two for the weekend. In the evening, we held a small campfire and ate BBQ. The cool smell of the pine forest mingled with the crackling smell of burning branches and the mouth-watering scent of grilled meat and eggplants. It was a memorable night, filled with laughter and memory. Our parents went to bed early and it was only me and Mia left. She looked at me for a good while and her eyes were earnest, as if she wanted to say something. Eventually she looked away and we chatted through the evening.

“I’ve been having nightmares about my uncle Steve,” she told me.

“Your uncle Steve?”

“Yeah. The one that drove while drunk and killed someone in an accident.  He was locked up in a correctional facility in Newport. You remember, right? You went with me,” she answered.

“Mia, I don’t remember any uncle Steve. Are you sure you’re just not dreaming him up?”

“Oh, could have sworn I went with you to see him. He even told me he liked you.”

The rest of the evening went on without any event, but those two nights near the lake were the best sleep that we had for a long time. Mia thought so too because when I saw her again the next day she looked just like the Mia of before, lively and energetic. Her bed bug bites started healing too. When my parents talked with Mia's parents the next day, they all talked about how refreshing it was to sleep near the lake. We packed up to return home and I wished we could stay every weekend.

Back home, the scientists gave us the initial results of the research on our sleep. We were among the neighborhoods with the longest sleep duration of all the areas that they researched, but our sleep quality was the lowest. Many of our neighbors had the same problem that we did, they would invariably start to fall asleep at around half past 10, but their sleep was never restful.

Maybe being home just made her miss Bob again, because at school she seemed really exhausted most of the time. One day, she was walking with me and started to put her hand on the wall to support herself.

“What’s wrong?” I asked her.

“Nothing, I’m just a little dizzy” she said. The people walking past us gave us worried look, but I assured them that things were fine. Mia rushed to the bathroom in a hurry and dropped a pink notebook. I picked it up and waited outside to give it to her, but it was time for the next period, so I put it in my backpack and planned to return it to her later.

When school was over, I waited for Mia at the gates, but she didn’t show up. I thought she must have gone to volunteer at the pet shelter and walked home. I was very curious of what was in the notebook and as soon as I got home, I opened it. I read the first page. It was her diary. I closed the book, angry with myself for having invaded something so private. But after tremendous struggle, I eventually opened the notebook and started reading.

A lot of the diary was about her day-to-day. How sad she was that Bob died, how she was coping with his passing. One entry caught my eyes, it was the day we stayed at the lakeside cabins. She marked it with a heart.

“Looked at Tim today. I wanted to tell him I like him a lot. Way more than just friends. But I’m afraid that if I tell him and it didn’t work out, our friendship would be over and awkward. What to do? Why didn’t he say anything? I thought he liked me too.”

Reading those lines made my heart jump for joy. It felt like hitting the lottery, it was exhilarating.

But the later entries made me worried. She talked about having visions, of her hands bloodied and her parents’ corpses in front of her. She wrote about memories that I didn’t even know she had, all of them dreary or violent. One of them involved having killed another dog and buried it next to Bob so that he wouldn’t be alone. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Mia was definitely not the type to do that. She said she wasn’t sure which was dream and which was reality anymore. I immediately went to her backyard to check, no dig mark. The grass surrounding Bob’s grave was still green.

When she got home that night, I gave her the diary.

“Did you read it?” she asked me.

“No, what did you write in it?” I lied.

“Oh, you know, just stuff. I wrote a poem for you in there you know,” she said, her eyes mischievous and knowing.

“I didn’t see any poem” I regretted the words as soon as I said them out loud.

“So you did read it. Did you read to that part?” she asked and moved closer.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t know which part” I answered.

“You’re such a dork. Anyway, it’s been a while since we hung out. Wanna meet up at the forest, this Saturday afternoon?”

I nodded and tried my best to keep calm. Inside, I was screaming with joy.

That night, I looked out the window to the sky and the stars. They were unusually bright. At around 10, a van rolled up into our neighborhood and starting making rounds. I didn’t pay it much thought, they must have been people who got lost. I thought about Mia and the upcoming date. I took out Romeo and Juliet and wrote a couple of pickup lines, but they sounded so stupid and bizarre that I tore up the paper.

The later days at school were especially tough for Mia. She always showed up tired. Her dreams were so bad that she failed a couple of tests. She told me that she couldn’t concentrate and was fearing going to sleep, because as soon as she hit the bed, the vision returned. That of her parents lying in a puddle of blood and her hands before her, bloodied. She talked about memories that I didn’t even know she had, like punching one of the soccer boys for catcalling her. She even forgot about Bob, asking me “Who’s Bob” when I had to remind her that it was her dog that she loved so much. She had this vacant stare that made me worried.

Saturday afternoon came and I waited for her in the forest. I looked at my watch. It was 10 A.M. Then 11 A.M. Noon. Then 1 P.M. I walked around the forest and took out my phone to call her. I thought it was some kind of prank. But calling her now would probably ruin her surprise for me, so I waited. Eventually, I had to go home after 3 P.M.

When I got home, Mia was standing at her house’s front lawn, watering them. She looked like her mind was in another place. I asked her if she remembered inviting me to a trip in the forest today. She told me she couldn’t remember saying that. Disappointed and angry, I told her that she was heartless and went home.

I was heart-broken but too young to drink alcohol. I opened the cupboard, there were a bunch of coffee pouches. In my anger, I took 5 of them and poured them all in the same cup and just drank. Several hours later, my hands got all jittery and my head felt like someone was jolting it with electricity.

In the evening, I looked out to the windows again towards the Mia's house. I realized that I must have been too hard on Mia, seeing that she was having so much problem with her sleep. I planned to apologize to her the next morning. I turned off the light in my room and stared out at the stars, their presence calmed me.

At around 10, the same van as before made a round in our neighborhood again. This time though, it stopped near my house. That was when I saw the top of the van open and a kind of contraption with antennas slowly emerging from inside. It made several full circles and I started feeling drowsy, but the caffeine in my body was just too strong. I ducked down and observed. After around 15 minutes, the van opened and from it, 4 people walked out. Two of them started making rounds around our neighborhood and the remaining two entered the Mia's house. I was so scared I forgot to do what I should have done earlier: calling the police. After a while, the two men stood right beneath my house and chatted.

“I’m telling ya there’s no need to worry, these people are out cold. We’ve been doing it for months, they don’t even know. This guy got top-shelf stuff, very high-quality vodka, gin and whiskey.”

“The boss said we need to be extra alert tonight,” the other guy answered.

“Oh, screw the boss. We’ve only got tonight until the project is closed. I’m telling you these drinks are way above our paycheck. So, you in or not?”

“Alright, but only for a short while.”

And with that, the two men made for one of the neighbor’s houses. I slowly walked downstairs, my parents were fast asleep. I opened the door and stepped outside. The night was cold, chilly wind blew on my face, making my entire body shiver. I rubbed my hands together and put them on my face to keep warm while I walked to the van and opened the back door.

Inside the van were a lot of screens with green letters. I stepped in and took a look at them. There were a lot of figures and charts that I didn’t understand. There were also a small, rectangular suitcase that was labeled “Backup”. I opened one and inside were several syringes with amber liquid. On a small desk beneath one large screen was a bunch of documents. I took one and read it.

“Project MK Hyper

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Diagnosis:

The subject was observed to behave accordingly to treatment. There’s a high probability that the subject will complete the imprinted task in \[redacted\]. Recommend extra dose of \[redacted\] for increased probability.”

I felt cold. My heart sank to my stomach and my hands just started shaking. Then I suddenly recalled that two men walked into Mia’s house. I wondered who the subject that they talked about was. I really hoped that it wasn’t Mia. I rushed out of the van and into my house. I had to bite my hands to keep them from trembling when I dialed 911.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“I w-want to report a home invasion…” and I told them all about what the van, about what I read and about what I was worried would happen. After a long silence, the operator just told me to quit joking and to watch fewer conspiracy movies before hanging up.

Desperate, I went to wake my parents, but they were in such deep sleep I couldn’t do anything. Then I heard car doors being opened. I looked out the window. The two men had returned from Mia's house and their partners were drunkenly singing on their way back to the van. I heard one man telling off the two drunks before shoving them into the van and speeding away. As the van left, I felt the imposing drowsiness disappear.

I went to my room to put on a coat before going to the Mia's house. But there was a bloodcurdling scream soon after. It was so loud and guttural that it woke up even my parents. Other neighbors started turning on their lights too. After that initial scream, there was a sound of crashing furniture and then another scream, louder this time, more bodied, as if in great pain. It came from the direction of Mia’s house. We rushed outside and my dad was faster, he came inside the house and then screamed. My mother walked in and she collapsed on the ground, her hands over her mouth and tears streaming out. Other neighbors were also curious and they started gathering outside of the house.

I slowly walked in, praying that it wasn’t Mia that was hurt. My prayer was answered, because when I walked in, Mia was holding a kitchen knife. Around the house were signs of struggle and in front of Mia were the corpses of her parents, blood oozing out from multiple stab wounds. Mia was sitting there, a vacant look on her face.

“What did you do Mia? How could you do this?” My dad asked, his voice trembling.

“I had to… finish the mission” she said, showing no emotion.

My dad had to slowly approach Mia and take the knife from her hand. It took a while. It felt like she could jump at us any moment. But as my dad approached, her hand went limp and he easily took the knife from her.

The police arrived soon after. They took Mia in. The case was nationally televised. “Teenage in grief commits homicide against her parents” they wrote on the title. On the day that the court case hearing happened, I was there too. The verdict was that Emilia was criminally insane, or crazy – as people would later talk about her. When asked why she had to murder her parents, she only said that it was her mission. The court decided that due to her age and the fact that she was diagnosed to be mentally unfit to serve her sentence, she would be sent to Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital, where she would likely spend the rest of her life.

I didn’t get the chance to talk to her one last time before she went away. When we got home, I waited until the police were gone, ducked under the crime scene tape and entered Mia's house. I climbed the stairs to Emilia’s room. On her desk was the notebook I found earlier. I took it and held it in my arms as I got home. It was the object of memory, of the childhood we shared and of how wonderful she was as a person. Emilia wasn’t crazy, she was made the subject of some twisted experiment. But there was no way I could prove that to anyone.

That was two weeks ago. Since then, I had been having nightmares. I would dream that my hands were bloody, holding a knife and that my parents' corpses were right in front of me. I had been having these memories about them screaming and yelling and sometimes even throwing stuff at me. I felt that was odd because my parents were normally very gentle. But when I saw tiny marks that seemed like bug bites, I knew I was next.",17,1768442062.0,nosleep,1,0.91,False

Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Nier Automata, 7th Dragon 2020, and Sonic Robo Blast 2. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I was heavily involved in Belgian anti-fascist resistance movements in the 1940s
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-38 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~Is it ok to punch Nazis? 


Always has been.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

1qd6dq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudSecurityPros/comments/1qd6dq8/the_real_problem_with_ioc_monitoring_in/,The Real Problem with IoC Monitoring in Enterprise Networks (And What Actually Helps),"I've been doing SOC work and security engineering for a while now, and one thing that keeps coming up is how hard it is to actually *use* indicators of compromise effectively at scale. You get feeds from threat intel providers, pull in your own forensic artifacts, maybe subscribe to a few ISAC lists—and then what? You're sitting on thousands of IoCs that either fire too late, create endless false positives, or just get lost in the noise.

The problem isn't the IoCs themselves. It's that most enterprise networks aren't set up to *act* on them fast enough to matter.

# Why This Is Harder Than It Sounds

In a perfect world, you'd ingest an IoC, scan your environment, get a match, and respond. But enterprise reality is messier. You've got hybrid cloud workloads, distributed identities, endpoints phoning home from coffee shops, and SaaS apps that don't log half of what you need. Your SIEM is drowning in events, and by the time you correlate a hash or IP address across multiple data sources, the attacker has already pivoted.

The other issue is context. A single IoC hit means almost nothing without knowing *where* it showed up, *who* was involved, and *what else* happened around the same time. If your tooling can't stitch that together automatically, you're back to manual investigation—which doesn't scale.

# What Actually Makes a Tool Worth Using

When evaluating IoC monitoring tools, I've learned to ask a few specific questions:

**Does it detect in real time, or only during scheduled scans?** Batch jobs that run every few hours are basically useless for active threats. You need event-driven detection that catches things as they happen.

**Can it correlate across your entire stack?** Logs, network traffic, identity events, cloud API calls—if the tool only looks at one dimension, you're going to miss lateral movement and post-compromise activity.

**Does it reduce noise intelligently?** Raw alert volume is not the same as actionable intel. The best tools suppress duplicates, filter out known-good activity, and prioritize based on risk and context.

**Does it handle cloud environments natively?** A lot of legacy tools were built for on-prem networks and bolt on cloud support as an afterthought. If you're running workloads in AWS, Azure, or GCP, you need something that understands cloud identity, API logs, and ephemeral infrastructure.

# Tool Categories (No Silver Bullets)

There are a few broad categories of tools that people use:

**Traditional SIEMs** are still everywhere, and they *can* work if you invest heavily in tuning, custom correlation rules, and integration work. But they're slow to query, expensive to scale, and not great at cloud-native threats.

**EDR and XDR platforms** give you deep endpoint visibility and can catch IoCs at the host level. They're strong on malware and process-level detections, but often blind to network-layer threats and cloud control plane activity.

**Network traffic analysis tools** are good for catching command-and-control traffic, data exfiltration, and lateral movement. But if your environment is heavily encrypted or cloud-based, they lose visibility fast.

**Cloud-native detection platforms** are newer, built around data lakes and event-driven architectures. They're faster, handle multi-cloud setups better, and can correlate across workloads and identities in ways traditional tools struggle with. The trade-off is they're still maturing, and you need engineering resources to get the most out of them.

# What We've Seen in Practice

I've spent time working with cloud security platforms that take this event-driven approach, and the difference in detection speed is measurable. One platform we evaluated—Cy5—caught IoC matches within seconds of ingestion by treating every event as a potential correlation point instead of waiting for batch processing. That shift from ""scan and alert"" to ""detect as it happens"" cut our mean time to detection by about 70%.

The bigger win was around correlation. When an IoC hit for a malicious domain lined up with a cloud role assumption and an unusual API call in the same timeframe, the platform surfaced it as a single incident instead of three separate alerts. That kind of automatic context is what separates noise from actual threats.

Another thing that stood out was how these cloud-native tools handle multi-tenancy and distributed workloads. Traditional SIEMs struggle when you're monitoring dozens of AWS accounts or trying to track identity activity across Azure AD, Okta, and on-prem AD simultaneously. Platforms purpose-built for cloud environments just handle that complexity better.

# Noise Reduction Isn't Optional Anymore

One of the hardest lessons we learned was that you can't brute-force your way through IoC monitoring. We've seen environments where 95% of alerts were false positives or duplicate signals. The tools that actually help are the ones that filter, deduplicate, and enrich *before* they ever hit an analyst's queue.

The platforms doing this well tend to use contextual enrichment and anomaly baselines to separate real threats from routine activity. It's not just about matching an IoC—it's about understanding whether that match is unusual for your environment.

# What's Actually Working for You?

I'm curious what other people are seeing in production. Are you still relying heavily on traditional IoC feeds and SIEM correlation? Or have you shifted toward more behavior-based detection and cloud-native tooling? For those running hybrid or multi-cloud environments, what's been your experience with detection speed and alert accuracy?

1qd6buz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1qd6buz/how_to_make_people_respect_you_without_saying_a/,How to Make People Respect You WITHOUT Saying a Word: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Look, I've spent years studying this shit. Books, podcasts, research papers, the whole nine yards. And here's what nobody tells you: Most people think respect comes from what you say, how loud you speak, or how much you talk. Wrong. Dead wrong.

The real power players? They command respect through pure presence. No words needed. I've watched it happen in boardrooms, social settings, and even at the gym. Some people walk in, and the energy shifts. Everyone notices. And it's not magic, it's psychology.

After diving deep into behavioral science research, body language studies, and interviewing people who just have that ""it"" factor, I figured out the playbook. This is what actually works.

  
 **Step 1: Fix Your Posture Like Your Life Depends On It**

Your body is screaming messages before you even open your mouth. Slouching? You're telling everyone you don't matter. Hunched shoulders? You're advertising insecurity like a billboard.

Stand tall. Shoulders back. Chest open. Not in some puffed-up gym bro way, but grounded and solid. Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard showed that power posing for just two minutes increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. Translation? Your body chemistry literally changes to make you more confident.

When you walk into a room, move deliberately. Not rushed, not apologetic. Own your space. Take up room. People unconsciously read this as authority and self-assurance.

  
**Step 2: Master the Art of Eye Contact**

This one's huge. Eye contact is basically a superpower most people are too scared to use properly. When someone's talking to you, hold their gaze. Not in a creepy staring contest way, but present and engaged. It says, ""I'm here, I'm confident, and I value what you're saying.""

Studies from the University of Wolverhampton found that people who maintain appropriate eye contact are perceived as more intelligent, confident, and trustworthy. Breaking eye contact too quickly? You look weak or dishonest.

Here's the trick: Hold eye contact for 3 to 5 seconds before looking away. When you do look away, do it slowly and deliberately. Not down (that's submission) but to the side or while nodding.

  
 **Step 3: Slow Down Everything**

Fast movements, rushed actions, fidgeting. All of it screams anxiety and lack of control. People in power move slowly, deliberately, and intentionally. Watch any CEO, top athlete, or respected leader. They're never in a frantic rush.

Slow down your gestures. Slow down your walk. Even slow down how fast you reach for your phone or coffee. This is called ""economy of movement,"" and it signals that you're in control of yourself and your environment.

Research from Princeton's Social Perception Lab shows that people make competence judgments in milliseconds based on physical movements. Slow, controlled movements = competent and confident.

  
**Step 4: Create Space and Silence**

Most people are terrified of silence. They fill every gap with words, nervous laughter, or small talk. Not you. Get comfortable with silence. When someone finishes talking, pause before responding. Let the silence sit for a beat or two.

This does two things: It shows you're actually thinking about what was said (rare these days), and it demonstrates you're not desperate to fill space. Confident people are comfortable with silence.

In negotiations or important conversations? The person who can sit in silence the longest usually wins. It's called the ""strategic pause,"" and it's used by top negotiators worldwide.

  
 **Step 5: Stop Seeking Validation**

This is the big one. Every time you look around to see if people noticed you, laugh at your own jokes, or explain yourself unnecessarily, you're leaking power. Seeking validation is the fastest way to lose respect.

Do your thing and don't check if anyone's watching. Finish your sentence and don't wait for approval. Make a decision and don't justify it unless asked. When you stop needing external validation, people sense it immediately.

Dr. Robert Cialdini's research in ""Influence"" shows that self-assured behavior without explanation triggers automatic respect responses in others. It's hardwired into social dynamics.

  
 **Step 6: Control Your Reactions**

Someone insults you? Don't flinch. Someone tries to get a reaction? Stone face. Bad news drops? Stay calm. This is emotional regulation, and it's incredibly powerful.

When you can maintain composure while everyone else is losing their shit, you become the person people look to for stability. It signals strength, maturity, and control.

The Stoics figured this out 2000 years ago, but modern neuroscience backs it up. When you control your emotional reactions, people unconsciously perceive you as more capable and trustworthy. Check out ""The Obstacle Is The Way"" by Ryan Holiday. It's packed with ancient Stoic wisdom applied to modern life. This book will make you question everything about how you handle adversity. Insanely practical.

  
 **Step 7: Take Up Space Confidently**

Stop making yourself small. Stop apologizing for existing in a space. Sit with your arms on the armrests. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Don't cross your arms defensively unless you're intentionally signaling ""back off.""

Territorial behavior is primal. Animals do it, humans do it. When you comfortably occupy space without aggression, others read it as confidence and status. Studies in environmental psychology show that people who use open, expansive postures are rated higher in leadership potential.

  
 **Step 8: Dress Like You Give a Damn**

Your appearance is nonverbal communication on steroids. You don't need expensive clothes, but you need to look put together, clean, and intentional. Wrinkled shirt and dirty shoes? You're saying, ""I don't respect myself enough to care.""

Research from Northwestern University on ""enclothed cognition"" shows that what you wear literally affects your psychological state and how others perceive you. Dress sharp and you'll carry yourself differently. Others will treat you differently.

  
**Step 9: Master the Handshake and Physical Presence**

Firm handshake (not bone-crushing, just solid). Make contact web to web, not fingers. Hold for 2 to 3 seconds with good eye contact. This single gesture communicates confidence, trustworthiness, and strength.

When standing in groups, don't hover on the edges. Plant yourself in a stable, grounded position. Feet shoulder-width apart, weight evenly distributed. You should look like you could be pushed and not move an inch.

  
 **Step 10: Be Unreactive to Social Pressure**

Someone tries to rush you? Move at your own pace. Group wants you to laugh at something you don't find funny? Don't fake it. People try to pull you into drama? Stay neutral.

When you refuse to be swayed by social pressure, you demonstrate internal strength. You're not performing for others. You're operating from your own center. This is magnetic.

For anyone wanting to dig deeper into these concepts through structured learning, there's an AI-powered app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology research, behavioral science books, and expert insights on presence and confidence. You tell it your goal, like ""command respect through body language"" or ""develop unshakeable self-assurance,"" and it creates a personalized learning plan with audio content you can listen to during commutes or workouts.

The depth is customizable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and neuroscience breakdowns. It connects dots between different sources, like the Stoic principles from ""Obstacle Is The Way"" and modern research on power posing. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid and science-backed.

  
 **Step 11: Listen More Than You Talk**

Paradoxically, silent attention is one of the most powerful forms of communication. When someone's talking, give them your full presence. No phone checking, no looking around, no planning your response.

Active listening (nodding occasionally, appropriate facial expressions, holding eye contact) shows you're secure enough to let others have the spotlight. Insecure people can't stop talking about themselves. Confident people listen because they don't need to prove anything.

Studies in conversational dynamics show that people who listen well are rated as more intelligent and charismatic than those who dominate conversations.

  
 **Step 12: Walk Away From Disrespect**

This is non-negotiable. When someone disrespects you, don't argue, don't explain, don't justify. Simply remove yourself from the situation. Walk away calmly.

Nothing commands respect faster than showing you don't need anyone's approval or presence in your life. When you're willing to walk away from disrespect without drama, people learn quickly that you have boundaries and self-respect.

This isn't about being cold. It's about demonstrating that your time and energy are valuable. ""Boundaries"" by Dr. Henry Cloud breaks down why this is so critical for healthy relationships and self-respect. Essential reading.

  
The truth is, respect isn't given because you demand it with words. It's earned through how you carry yourself, how you handle pressure, and how you value yourself. These aren't tricks or hacks. They're behavioral shifts that change how the world perceives and treats you.

The system wants you to be insecure, seeking validation, and easy to manipulate. Biology wired us to read body language and nonverbal cues faster than words. When you align your nonverbal communication with genuine self-respect, you become someone people naturally respect.

No words necessary.

I was fourteen when my parents divorced. Their arguments had been constant, walls shaking, doors slamming, glass shattering. I learned to hide in the corners of my room, headphones blaring, trying not to notice the hollowness growing in my chest.

My mother moved out, my father retreated into work, and I was left in a fractured house that smelled of bleach and old coffee, echoing with absence. It wasn’t just the loneliness; it was the feeling that life was broken and that I was powerless to fix it.

That’s when I discovered lucid dreaming. The first time I realized I was aware inside a dream, I felt a surge of control I had never known. I could bend the world to my will. Anything I imagined, it would come true.

For the first time, I could create happiness, create worlds where pain didn’t exist, where I wasn’t an observer to suffering.

I was God.

At first, I started small.

I walked through forests that glowed in shades I had no names for. I could summon rainbows that arched across violet skies. I made friends in these worlds, creatures that spoke with humor and kindness, always ready to listen, always ready to understand. I relived moments of joy I hadn’t had, moments of safety and warmth that never existed in real life.

I even conjured, what I deemed perfect, my own home. The divorce never happened. The resentment my parents had in reality was hidden by the loving joy that I created.

We could be a family.

But it wasn’t enough. My control became more deliberate, more urgent.

I wasn't satisfied. I needed more.

I experimented.

I created cities that pulsed with light and sound, alive like music made manifest. I created beings who adapted to me, who grew and learned from me. I rewrote history, making impossible things happen, mountains sprouting overnight, rivers folding in impossible loops, stars that danced to the rhythm of my thoughts.

I was addicted.

As I built society further and further, I couldn't differentiate if it I was in reality or asleep. It didn't matter. I didn't want to wake up.

The more I created, the more my waking life seemed hollow, gray, insignificant.

What felt like days, even weeks, were merely only hours of sleep. I'd even mastered to bend my created beings with their own self thought. Their free will in my dreams. Oh how they dreamt and I, their God, could see their own dreams. Their own thoughts and ambitions.

Then I made a decision I will never forget.

I wanted to see what would happen if I stopped interfering, if I left my creations to their own devices. If I, their creator, were to disappear.

Within the dream, I closed my eyes and fell into a dream within a dream, drifting deeper than I ever had.

I left my creation running, untended, leaving it to course as it would without me.

At first, it seemed fine.

The sky remained impossibly vibrant. Oceans of liquid crystal rippled beneath my feet. Cities thrived, creatures and people roamed, oblivious to my absence. But subtle changes began. A tower leaned slightly, though I hadn’t touched it. A river hesitated mid-flow, as if uncertain where it wanted to go. The citizens paused, glancing around with expressions I had never taught them, curiosity, doubt, even impatience.

Then came the worse. A nightmare scenario.

The sky was red. And fire began.

I watched in shock as my world, that I have spent a millennia creating in my head burn. The people, the wildlife, the world itself ate itself.

Greed, hunger for power, the vial vines of corruption overtook my world, and I sat and watched.

What seem to be red liquid fell from the skies, putting and end to the flames.

When it was it over, I returned to my world, imagining that my presence would restore order. But the moment I stepped back, I realized it was already gone.

The survivors of my world looked at me with such anger. I could see how vile in their heart had become. Their being was split from me. From my control.

My world was no longer mine.

I awoke. The morning sun streamed through my curtains, but it felt alien. The apartment, familiar for so long, seemed different.

How long was I asleep?

Shadows stretched at impossible angles. The floorboards creaked where they never had. I told myself it was paranoia, that I had been dreaming too much, but deep down I knew something had changed. Something I had made had learned to exist without me.

That night, I returned.

I didn’t interfere. I simply watched.

The rivers were gone, the mountains were restless, buildings destroyed, and the citizens, my children, my creations, still tore at one another like a society that no longer needed its God.

And I realized, as I observed them, that I had indeed made a mistake.

The addictive thrill of creation, the power I had abused for joy and control, had given birth to something that might outlast me, something that might never remember me.

I woke, trembling. The air in my apartment felt heavy, as though weighted by expectation. I could almost hear the pulse of my dreamworld behind my eyelids, faint but insistent. A world I had built, one that no longer needed me, one that might thrive, change, and evolve beyond my comprehension.

I have not closed my eyes since. I fear what I might see. I fear what might remember me.

I fear that if I sleep again, I will discover a truth I cannot bear.

1qd6a5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MoonrootWitch/comments/1qd6a5n/6_months_and_a_few_days_on_hrt/,6 months and a few days on HRT,"I just hit 6 months and a few days on HRT, and it’s starting to feel less like counting the days and more like something that shows up in my everyday life.

Physically, changes are definitely happening. I have breasts now, and they’re getting harder to hide under clothes. Today, for example, I slung my lunch bag over my shoulder, said goodbye to my entire office, and only realized in the bathroom right before leaving that it made my chest very noticeable. I’m still not out at work except to two friends from my master’s program, so I got a little anxious 😅. I’ve also noticed fat starting to redistribute to other parts of my body, and my face doesn’t look as angular anymore. Some people have told me I look softer, even cuter, and hearing that still makes my heart skip a beat.

The way the world reads me has started to shift too. A few times now, people in stores or on the street have called me “miss,” and then paused like they were reprocessing what they were seeing, lol. In the office bathroom, I’ve noticed men giving me confused looks when I walk in, like “wait, what’s happening?” It’s strange, awkward, and also kind of affirming in a way. A couple of coworkers didn’t recognize my profile pic and thought I was a new hire, a girl.

Emotionally, I’ve changed a lot. I cry way more easily now, over movies, small moments, random thoughts. But I’m also genuinely happier. I feel lighter. My fiancée tells me I look happier, and honestly, I feel it too.

I’ve come out to many more people over these months, and I’ve been incredibly lucky, everyone has taken it really well so far. Funny enough, several of them told me they already suspected something. That support has meant more to me than I can put into words.

My wardrobe has grown a lot, and I finally have real options when I want to dress more feminine. I’m still a bit shy about going out in full fem mode, but one of my New Year’s resolutions is to finally do it, fuck fear.

I also chose two names that I feel deeply happy and comfortable with. So comfortable, actually, that today when I went to get coffee with my boss, I ordered it using one of my chosen names. When they called it out, my boss asked me about it, I panicked and overexplained, hehe.

I’ve also started laser hair removal on my face, and the results so far have been really good, which has helped my confidence more than I expected.

And unrelated to HRT, but still very much part of this chapter of my life, I got engaged. Yay 🥰

In a few days I’ll be celebrating my birthday, and it makes me incredibly happy to know that everyone who’s coming, about 30 people, already knows about my gender identity. Being able to exist fully as myself in that space feels like a gift.

I know I’m still early in my transition, but for the first time in a long time, I truly feel like I’m moving forward.",1,1768441479.0,u_MoonrootWitch,0,0.99,False
1qd69s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1qd69s0/is_it_okay_to_ask_bridesmaids_without_doing/,Is it okay to ask bridesmaids without doing bridesmaid boxes?,"Hello!! I need some advice.

I know it’s really common now to make bridesmaid boxes and give gifts when you ask, but I’d honestly prefer to keep things simple and give a small, meaningful gift the day before the wedding instead, not as part of the “ask.” I’m just not sure what the best or most “acceptable” way to ask is.

I know asking in person is usually ideal, but that’s not realistic for everyone. My fiancé’s sister lives about 8 hours away, and we’re both really busy. She’s just starting college and figuring life out, and it feels like a big hassle and expense to travel just to ask a question. I’m thinking about sending her a letter to ask, is that okay?

I’m also considering asking two of my cousins. We grew up together and I love them, but we haven’t been as close the last few years just because we’re all busy trying to get our lives figured out. I’d really like them to be part of it, but I don’t want to pressure anyone. My plan was to ask them in person and let them know there’s absolutely no rush to decide and no hard feelings at all if they say no, they could just think on it and text me later. Is that a normal or okay way to handle it?

The last person I want to ask lives in the same city as me. I love her, but we haven’t hung out as much recently because she’s very busy and also makes significantly more money than I do. She’s been really sweet about keeping our hangouts low-key, coffee, hikes, etc., but I worry she might expect a bridesmaid box or something more expensive, which I’m trying to avoid. I was thinking of asking her out for coffee and asking her then.

For context, my maid of honor is already chosen. She’s another cousin I’m very close with. I asked her over FaceTime when I called to tell her I was engaged, and she didn’t mind at all. Still, I’m second-guessing what’s considered “proper.”

One more thing I’m unsure about: our wedding isn’t until next October, so it still feels pretty early. I don’t know if it’s better to wait until we’re closer, like a year out, or if waiting too long would feel rude, like I took a long time to decide. I’m also a little worried that my friend and my fiancé’s sister might already be expecting to be asked, and I don’t want to make things awkward.

So basically, is it okay to ask bridesmaids without a bridesmaid box? Is a letter an okay way to ask someone who lives far away? Is it okay to ask early, or better to wait until we’re closer? Am I overthinking this?

Any thoughts or personal experiences would really help. Thank you!!

Bonus question!! I want to ask my uncle to be the officiant. But I was just gonna ask him next time I see him? Should that be in a letter a phone call? Idk. I think that one is way too early to ask tho bc it’s not an expected position like a bridesmaid is.

Chapter 185 : 10/10

Chapter 186 : 10/10

(ch176) It seems i was somewhat wrong. Edward has no intention of it being possible at all for all 5 children to pass, so he limited the stamps to 4, and ontop of that, Kate is being watched by Sarah and Mia to try to prevent her from going easy. The other 3 pairs may have it easier, hopefully. Also does this mean that if they aren't able to save all 5 of the children, the sacrifice would be Matilda? Since she's pairless as of now. Well, Kate probsies won't let that happen 

(ch178) Okay, this was the most confusing chapter so far, lowkey don't get what happened in pages 10-12. I guess they had troubles communicating, but it didn't completely cut off?? Because Oscar heard ""Scream"" and that gave him an idea to confuse douglas using his soot power to generate sound. That was pretty good!

(Ch181) Wow, Candy's for sure ""putting up a show"". Emilico's mumbling must be related to the backstory of both of them, since As far as i remember Candy was also in the circus. Wow. I'm probably also gonna keep reading, i'm way too addicted. Probably gonna do this volume in one day instead of half a day

Okay, finished. Wow, just wow, this was peak. I don't even know where to start

First of all, it seems Edward caught on to ""4 subjects"" back then from Taylor. In one of my posts (I think its at about the start of the hunt for the powerless arc - i mentioned and caught on to taylor mentioning 4 subjects, as he was unaware of Emilico's intrusion into the manor, although i didn't realise back then this scene hid Edward's thoughts and actions to maintain secrecy and assumed he'd have a flashback of it when it would be already too late, which was wrong. Still kind of cool ive caught on to that 

Okay, first of all, the fights. I didn't like Oliver's that much, but it's cool that it led to Laurel's power awakening. Although i lowkey panicked when Oliver did that thinking he went too far and antagonized Laurel too much

Danny's test wasn't that great either, but him being distracted due to Oscar's stuff was funny asf. It's great Evelyn passed him though, since she wasn't even involved in the first place

Oscar's test was cooler, being able to trick Douglas with the stones in order to hide his location is kind of smart, though Danny led him to that

Stella's test was awesome tbh, absolute peak. Candy was able to realise and deduce that Kate helped her during the test. Sarah was annoying af, not only she stole Candy's stamp but also rushed her and then forced their living dolls onto this cruel game.  Thankfully though, that.. somewhat backfired. Mainly because the 3rd floor shadows didnt take his words for granted and didnt think getting into the manor was that big of a deal somehow, and at the same time, that experience allowed for Candy and Emilyko to bond

I don't quite understand why did Candy doubt her, because she already realised Kate helped her, unless i'm wrong and she realised after the challenge. Regardless, more circus flashbacks + the events unfolding in the maze was peak. Especially when Candy realised she can trust Emi and they completed the maze flawlessly 

It also seems Kate took advantage of the fact that she only ""showed off"" her wings. which left Sara unprepared for a possibility that she used her soot to make the stamp fall into Stella's power thingy

Candy is really beyond impressive. At this point, she's almost as smart as Kate tbh, she's doing things really well

Edward investigating Kate is also really cool, it's neat that Taylor's clue wasn't just dismissed and forgotten about it, although it's also unfortunate bc that won't benefit Kate

Candy is seriously so awesome, she managed to understand everything so quickly using her lip-reading ability and due to the fact that Emilyko figured out so much and decided to lipsync Kate to tell everything to Candy, lol

It seems that Douglas is about to betray Kate again, however, there's ALOT of possibilities... 

First of all, Edward's soot power. I'm pretty sure he's able to manipulate sound, not sure about the details, but couldn't this be used to interfere with communications of Oscar's things? If so, that may be a problem. Especially if Douglas is going to make Edward aware of the operation going on. Unless they somehow figured out Edward already was aware of the operation because of his soot power, which i don't think is the case, having douglas reveal their plan to him does literally nothing for them, and i don't think that happened either

Regardless, one thing i don't understand is if douglas betrayed them how are they even going to take the key? Didn't Douglas only start the reproduction of the key using the mold? I Don't think he put it in the hallway yet. And i doubt a single soot soldier can do much against both douglas and Edward, assuming douglas is about snitch to him on the entire operation

What's going to happen next? 

Honestly, i'm not sure at all.. But attempting to get douglas back on their side by launching a transmitter rock in the same way the soot soldier was launched into the room does seem plausible

Maybe that's where Maryrose finally appears, although i feel like that's more likely to happen after the rescue operation during the rebellion arc. Shirley's power may also come in handy

Not much theories as of now though, maybe i should combine the thing into 2 posts once i complete the next volume

Back, maybe it's a good idea to theorize after the half of a volume like i did before, that's if i do decide to do one volume per day again lol. This was too addicting for me the previous time i fear

Chapter 187 : 9.1/10  
Chapter 188 : 9.3/10  
Chapter 189 : 9.4/10  
Chapter 190 : 9.8/10  
Chapter 191 : 10/10  
Chapter 192 : 10/10  
Chapter 193 : 10/10  
Chapter 194 : 10/10 

(ch189) It seems ""fragment of favor"" thing is essential for the unification ritual, who would've thought!

And besides, this chapter creates a lot of room for theorizing

Is Edward also aware of it? (Probably, because his thoughts seemed to go over it, i feel like this one's stupid) Are Anthony and Edward working together? Is fragment of favor different depending on.. who made it? Since Lou is brainwashed into worshipping Christopher and not the great grandfather. Is Christopher alive? Did Edward help him cheat death upon managing the unification ritual?? If not, surely there's atleast more to his character than we know so far?

Well.. I wonder.. 

First of all, i'd like to mention that Edward was initially surprised when Douglas mentioned the soot ivy attack. That wouldn't be possible if he's allied with Anthony, no? Unless anthony kept that a secret from him

Then.. During Edward's convo with Lewis, i'm pretty sure he talked shit about Christopher.. Weird.. Was he not aware Lewis is Anthony's pawn

To conclude... Are Edward and Anthony secretely working together, but Anthony is just manipulating him? That's an outrageous lack of information for if they're really allied in good faith

Besides, that convo with Lewis wasn't just fabricated, we've seen it. ""Hide information from readers to conceal major plot points later on"" is just hiding characters thoughts and plans, but that is a full on convo, it couldn't be faked. That means either Edward is manipulated by Anthony, or they're not allied

Christopher being alive seems such a good theory. Edward concealing everything and acting as if he resents Christopher to help him, while also being manipulated and used by them at the same time. (That's assuming Christopher is alive. Still possible christopher didn't die but he's getting manipulated by Anthony, though)

Okay, i just realised i didn't view the last slide by accident, which clearly shows a shadow-y figure which is clearly Christopher. He did cheat his death then, that makes alot of things clearer, it also explains why Lewis is his pawn - he either works together with Edward (tbh unlikely) or sneaks into the ritual room and changes the brainwashing onto Christopher. That still sort of gave me room to have thoughts so i'm actually happy about clicking on that slide late lol. Edward being aware of fragments of favor leads down to either the fact that he works together with Anthony and that's his thing, or it's not an Anthony thing and is required for the unification ritual, but Anthony stole it while sneaking into the unification room. Makes me wonder - Are Anthony and Christopher unified?? That power does seem strong AF, however, it's not impossible it's achieved without unification. 

Well, fragments of favor being tied to the ritual does seem very plausible. After all, the children die quickly after using it and releasing their soot - that resembles ""failure"" of the unification ritual. It's likely the unification ritual requires preparations and their living doll to be present at all times, aswell as for them to be in the coffin, though fragment of favor is most likely if not most definetely a part of it

Anyway, this is really interesting. I'm continuing now

(ch190) Okay, they are unified. Makes sense! OH SHIT THAT'S LEWIS... lmao.. Each page feels like a reveal. Finished now, looks like they weren't working together with Edward, then. Explains how he got here too, since it's Lewis and not Anthony and Lewis pretends to work with Edward. I completely forgot they needed a key to get here, but it seems Anthony has one aswell. And it's probably created from ""mold"" aswell, if i had to guess

I am pretty confused at how Louise said she'll become an adult. It feels as if she was brainwashed, but then quickly came back to her senses by remembering what Kate said. 

Surely, Anthony is here seperately from Ram.. Otherwise, it would mean he took over her key. Meh, that probably didn't happen. He probs just stole the mold from the research team and duplicated the key - Ram will still appear later on, won't she? Or wait, there was a 3 days before the debut flashback.. Right, that explains it. Doesn't it mean it's been 3 days since she's in the coffin though? It's possible Lou's dead already. Ugh. UGH. Please be alive, please be alive, please be alive..

For now i'll say Anthony didn't use any unusual methods to brainwash Lewis. Lewis was just fond of Christopher and he abused that, and his soot power was very suitable for things aswell. Could his soot power create a different-kind-of fragment of favor? The one that makes u brainwashed to christopher and not the great grandfather? Possible. Ima continue now

(ch191) Oh god.. This hit hard, thankfully it seems Louise survived. However, i am somewhat confused. Wasn't this the flashback? Why did Ram just give the key up to Anthony and only use Shirley with Oscar's ball to get to Louise and prevent her from unifying. Even if that helps prevent her from unifying, how will that rescue her from the thing? 

Regardless.. 10/10 EP, Ricky's grief and the backstory.. It was all perfect! 

(Ch193) Wow.. Just wow, peak.. So that explains it - Anthony was involved with Kate in the operation, however they went through an incomplete transformation, but still were able to save her somehow.. Due to Patrick's soot power. Holyy, that got me so stressed. Anyway, i think i'll do one more chapter to finish this arc and then call it quits for today. I can then split the rest of the volume with the beginning of the next one. 

Okay, finally done with it now. Wow, peak. Might be my fav arc as of now tbh, but i'm unsure

First, Mia is crazy. Getting into a manor and not wanting to go back, aswell as manipulating Sara, wow..

""Catherine"" so this adult knew but still somewhat-dismissed Edward's evidence. Is he by any chance going to help her rebuild the mirrors house, maybe?? 

Anthony.. Damnit, he almost made Louise unify and brainwashed her.. It seems they made a last minute decision to let Ram ship them back to not antagonize them as much, although Louise would probably tell them everything. Her rampage seems to mean she broke free from the ""true coffee""  thing and since louise was able to live with Patrick's soot powers, could Lewis have lied to her? Well.. I guess not, since i don't think many people know of Patrick's soot powers and nor were they thought about during the unification since he wasn't there. 

Since the brainwashing thing into believing into Christopher is a soot power that explains why Patrick's soot power worked, but weren't there more factors like the true coffee and the fragments of favor? Still kinda weird but glad it worked out.. Hopefully Louise will go back to normal later on, she kind of did go crazy but atleast she realised she doesn't need the ritual despite the coffee's effect

This arc was in general such an emotional rollercoaster.. Douglas coming back in and believing in faith, Lou's backstory, Louise getting so close to dying but getting saved.. Just peak, this is why i love this show. 

Anyway, i should continue reading tomorrow and hopefully not get carried away. Hopefully Rebellion arc will be even better. Although, since they did trick Edward into believing it was a failure, i feel like Louise could be hidden well enough. Anyway, since the adult knows now, it's still risky. I just wonder if Joseph is on her side or not, probably not, but maybe..

Maybe Maryrose comeback during next arc?? I hope!! Her soot powers are soo useful. Hopefully she didn't just stay idle all this time, either. And Anthony with Lewis are also going to be tough to take on. The newcomers are all so good at cooperations and will definetely be formidable allies aswell. I'm super excited for the rebellion arc",5,1768441266.0,ShadowsHouse,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. Ive been in the news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media covered it. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.
