I lost my job and a long-time friendship over this.  
I used to manage a small coffee shop, had been for years. I hired many of my friends during this, including a roommate/bestfriend of 8+ years. It was going well until a few months ago, I hired another friend. She began conducting herself in an inappropriate way at the job, to myself and other members of the staff. Making sexual jokes, that kind of thing. At first, I shut it down. Eventually our friendship grew - she began inviting me out to bars and back to her place. The flirtatious jokes and humor progressed. She was sober, and I usually was not, so out of politeness (or intoxication), I usually returned the joke or flirty banter.  
After awhile, I asked her upfront if she had feelings for me - she declined to answer. I took the lack of 'yes' as a 'no', which I verbalized, then asked her why she keeps flirting with me - she declined to answer again. I apologized the next day at work for my forwardness. However, her flirting did not stop. The jokes did not stop. She began doing the same thing to another coworker, however this time it was a lesbian in a monogamous relationship. This coworker also returned the flirtations (despite being in a relationship) and they eventually engaged in a sexually-charged interaction. I confronted the girl in the relationship about the nature of their relationship *with her girlfriend present* and things got really bad from there.   
My coworker found out and became irate with me. I attempted to apologize to all three of them for getting involved, but this led to more scorn from the coworker. She tried to get my kicked off of a creative project I founded - it didn't work. This seemed to be the nail in the coffin - the following day, her and the woman in the relationship went to my boss to tell them I am a predator. That I attempted to sexually assault one of them, that I steal from the company, and all other kinds of far-fetched lies. My boss fired me, as he is currently on trial for a sex crime (long story, holy shit) and did not want the bad publicity. He said he did not believe the accusations, however, and has been pretty supportive otherwise.  
The part that hurt most was coming home from my firing to find that my roommate/bestfriend had packed up all of their stuff and left. Just abandoned me.

TL;DR - I got involved with lesbian love triangle drama and now all my friends think I'm a predator!

It hurts so bad and it's been really hard dealing with my overwhelming loneliness as the holidays approach. How do you guys get through this?",2,1731465110.0,SupportForTheAccused,0,1.0,False
1gq2liw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Loveseat_Recliner/comments/1gq2liw/double_recliner_loveseat/,Double Recliner Loveseat,"The Benefits of Choosing a Double Recliner Loveseat for Your Living Space
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When designing your living space, comfort and style often go hand-in-hand. One excellent option to consider is the double recliner loveseat. Offering a combination of cozy seating and elegant design, it‚Äôs perfect for modern homes. This piece of furniture can transform your living room into a welcoming hub for relaxation and entertainment.

Here are some of the key benefits you can enjoy when you choose a double recliner loveseat:

- **Enhanced Comfort:** Double recliner loveseats feature ergonomic designs that are specifically crafted to provide exceptional comfort. With plush cushions and adjustable reclining positions, you can easily find the perfect angle to unwind after a long day.
- **Space Efficiency:** Ideal for smaller living spaces, a loveseat takes up less room than a full-sized sofa. A double recliner loveseat offers the benefits of a two-person seating arrangement without crowding your space.
- **Versatile Styles:** These loveseats come in a variety of styles, materials, and colors. Whether you prefer a classic leather look or a soft fabric option, you‚Äôll find a design that complements your existing decor.
- **Reclining Functionality:** Many double recliner loveseats allow both seats to recline independently. This means you and your partner can adjust your seating to suit your preferences, whether you want to sit upright or lean back for a nap.
- **Perfect for Movie Nights:** Imagine snuggling up for a movie night with your loved ones on a comfortable double recliner loveseat. The cozy seated area, combined with the reclining feature, makes it an ideal choice for watching your favorite films together.
- **Easy Maintenance:** Most double recliner loveseats are made with materials that are easy to clean and maintain. Whether you have kids or pets, spills and messes can be easily wiped away, allowing your piece to stay looking great for years.

Investing in a double recliner loveseat means prioritizing your comfort without sacrificing style. Here‚Äôs how you can maximize its benefits in your living space:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/double-recliner-loveseat  
  
- **Pair it with Coordinating Furniture:** To create a harmonious living area, choose coffee tables, end tables, and accent chairs that blend well with your loveseat. This cohesion sets up a visually appealing space.
- **Use Throw Pillows:** Adding throw pillows can make your double recliner loveseat even cozier. Opt for bold colors or patterns to create a playful contrast, making the loveseat an attractive focal point in the room.
- **Consider the Layout:** Position your loveseat to encourage conversation. Placing it opposite a TV or near larger seating areas invites relaxation and social interaction.
- **Utilize Footstools:** For added leg support, think about incorporating a matching footstool or ottoman. This can enhance the overall experience of reclining even further.

Furthermore, the health benefits of a double recliner loveseat are not to be overlooked. Reclining can alleviate pressure on your back, helping to reduce discomfort during periods of prolonged sitting. If you work from home or enjoy binge-watching shows, this can significantly enhance your personal comfort.

It is also worth noting that a double recliner loveseat can foster bonding moments. Whether you‚Äôre enjoying a lazy Sunday together or hosting friends for game night, its design encourages closeness and shared experiences.

To ensure you find the perfect double recliner loveseat for your home, keep these tips in mind:

- **Measure Your Space:** Before committing to a purchase, make sure you measure the space where you plan to place the loveseat. Ensure it fits comfortably without overpowering the room.
- **Test Comfort Levels:** If possible, visit a store to test different loveseats. Feel the cushioning, check the reclining mechanisms, and sit for a while to see if it meets your comfort needs.
- **Check for Quality:** Look for high-quality materials that will stand the test of time. Frames made from hardwood are often more durable compared to softwoods.

Choosing a double recliner loveseat brings unparalleled comfort and functional style into your living space. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to create an inviting atmosphere where you can unwind, enjoy quality time, or catch up on your favorite shows, elevating your home experience to new heights.

Tips for Maintaining Your Double Recliner Loveseat for Longevity
----------------------------------------------------------------

Double recliner loveseats are a fantastic addition to many living rooms. They offer comfort and cozy space for relaxation, making them a favorite for families and couples alike. However, just like any other piece of furniture, they require some care and attention to ensure they last for years. By following a few simple maintenance tips, you can keep your double recliner loveseat looking great and functioning smoothly.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/double-recliner-loveseat  
  
### Regular Cleaning

Dust and dirt can accumulate on your double recliner loveseat over time, impacting both its appearance and functionality. Here are some cleaning tips:

- **Weekly Dusting:** Use a soft cloth or microfiber duster to gently wipe down the surfaces. This prevents dirt buildup, ensuring your loveseat remains fresh.
- **Vacuuming:** Utilize a handheld vacuum or an attachment on your regular vacuum cleaner to remove debris from the seams and crevices. Aim for a weekly schedule.
- **Spot Cleaning:** For spills or stains, address them immediately. Blot the area with a clean cloth and a mild fabric cleaner. Avoid scrubbing, as this may harm the fabric.

### Condition the Upholstery

Depending on the fabric or leather of your double recliner loveseat, treating the upholstery can go a long way in maintaining its quality.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/double-recliner-loveseat  
  
- **Fabric Upholstery:** Use a fabric protector to prevent stains. Additionally, applying a suitable upholstery cleaner every few months helps maintain vibrancy.
- **Leather Upholstery:** Leather needs conditioning to keep it from drying out and cracking. Use a leather conditioner every six months to rejuvenate the material.

### Check Mechanisms Regularly

The reclining mechanisms are a critical part of your double recliner loveseat. To ensure they function smoothly, perform regular checks.

- **Lubricate Moving Parts:** Every few months, apply a silicone-based lubricant to the reclining mechanisms. This helps prevent squeaks and stiffness.
- **Inspect for Wear:** Check for any signs of wear or damage. If you notice anything unusual, such as resistance when reclining, seek professional repair before it worsens.

### Protect from Direct Sunlight

Direct sunlight can cause colors to fade and materials to degrade over time. Here are some tips for protection:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/double-recliner-loveseat  
  
- **Reposition Up Against Walls:** If possible, place your double recliner loveseat away from windows or direct sunlight.
- **Use Curtains or Blinds:** Keep curtains closed or use blinds to shield your loveseat from harsh sunlight when you‚Äôre not around.
- **Consider Slipcovers:** For extra protection, invest in slipcovers that can reflect sun rays while also providing an additional layer of defense against dirt and spills.

### Mind the Weight Limit

Every double recliner loveseat has a weight limit. Exceeding this limit can put stress on the frame and mechanisms, leading to potential damage. Be mindful of how many people are using the loveseat at once, and ensure they are within the recommended weight limits provided by the manufacturer.

### Rotate the Cushions

To promote even wear, consider rotating the cushions regularly. This practice helps maintain their shape and prevents one side from becoming too compressed. Aim to rotate cushions every couple of weeks to extend their lifespan.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/double-recliner-loveseat  
  
### Repair Rips and Tears Quickly

Accidents happen, but timely action can prevent small issues from becoming big problems. If you notice any rips or tears:

- **Patch Kits:** Use upholstery patch kits designed for your particular loveseat's fabric.
- **Seek Professional Repair:** If the damage is extensive, consult a professional upholstery service quickly to prevent further damage.

By following these maintenance tips, you‚Äôll enhance the longevity of your double recliner loveseat while ensuring it remains a welcoming and comfortable piece for your home. With regular attention, you can keep it in excellent condition for many cozy evenings to come.

### Conclusion

Selecting a double recliner loveseat can significantly enhance your living space, providing comfort and relaxation suitable for any occasion. Its ability to accommodate two people while allowing ultimate lounging positions makes it a fantastic choice for couples, families, or anyone who loves to unwind. You will create a welcoming atmosphere, encouraging cozy evenings and social gatherings.

To ensure that your double recliner loveseat stands the test of time, commitment to proper maintenance is essential. Regularly cleaning the upholstery, checking for loose screws, and applying protective treatments can drastically extend its lifespan. Additionally, be mindful of weight limits and avoid abrupt movements, which can damage the mechanism over time.

Investing in a double recliner loveseat is not just about immediate comfort; it's a long-term addition to your home that can bring joy for years to come. By choosing quality materials and following maintenance tips, you can enjoy the perfect blend of style and durability.

1gq2l8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/1gq2l8s/my_nephew_married_a_psycho_that_shot_herself_is/,My nephew married a psycho that shot herself. Is there anyone dealing with something similar?,"Reddit final 

Sitka, AK 2021; my nephew was 16 and we found out he had his first real gf (18f) who wanted nothing to do with his family. That is pretty normal for a teenage couple, so we tried not to let it be too big of a red flag. It‚Äôs just, the gf was just not what we were expecting. My sister‚Äôs family is very modest, old fashioned, and hard working. They‚Äôre the epitome of an Alaskan family. The gf belonged to the same tribe as my BIL, but she didn‚Äôt participate in any of the tribal gatherings or classes. She had fried her dark hair with bleach, basically only wore pink and shades of oatmeal to showcase her large breasts, and seemed to be obsessed with acrylic nails, shapewear, and bougie coffee. She was a vegan and claimed she was a nurse, but we knew she couldn‚Äôt be much higher than a CNA at 19. 
As the months went on the more my nephew became covered in hickeys and the less we saw of him. When he was 17, my sister and her husband financially helped him get his first apartment. He had a good job and his gf, now fianc√©e (19f) was supposedly a nurse, so off they went into the real world. We were happy he was making his way in the world. 

In 2022 things had been rocky with my nephew and his fianc√©e (now 20f). Right before he turned 18, my nephew privately told his mom (37f) that his fianc√©e was secretly 5 months pregnant, but has never been to a doctor‚Äôs appointment. We were all shocked and also wondering if it was a fake pregnancy to hold onto my nephew. It took weeks of invites after that for my nephew and his fianc√©e to come to a very expensive vegan dinner my sister painstakingly prepared. From what I understand the fianc√©e hardly touched her vegan meal and seemed enraged my sister knew of her pregnancy. My sister offered support and assistance, the couple left shortly after due to a brewing argument between the two over my nephew not keeping the pregnancy a secret. 
It was very confusing. The following weeks, my nephew was a wreck. He was working full time, as well as taking on all household duties, cleaning, cooking, shopping, etc  when his fianc√©e went into early labor on Christmas night. My great-nephew was brought earthside during a winter storm that left all flights grounded. After hours of waiting for a neonatal-prepped ambulance, he was lifeflighted to another part of Alaska. 
My nephew (18m) took a leave from work and jumped through insurance hoops to obtain housing so he could be nearby during the weeks his son was in the hospital. My sister flew to help her son get setup, and paid his bills while he was with his son. The baby‚Äôs mother took her time to fly in see her son. She wasn‚Äôt all that concerned with bonding with her newborn. She only posted online pics of her baby with his dad, and more about shopping, getting her nails done, and repeatedly about her specialty vegan coffee drink.  

She rarely visited her premature son who didn‚Äôt have a functioning thyroid to regulate his hormones and his kidneys would back up with urine without proper care. He was 8wks early, but he was a little fighter. 
After more than two months of monitoring and extensive testing, his conditions were deemed manageable. They sent my great-nephew home right before his actual due date. My nephew went back to work 6 days a week so his fianc√©e could stay home with their son. The baby was a little medically fragile due to the thyroid condition. If he didn‚Äôt take his medication in the morning, his body wouldn‚Äôt have anything to stimulate him into being awake. 
The doctors warned his mom (who still claimed she was a nurse) that without properly managed medication, he was at risk for things like permanent brain damage, head misshaping, poor bone density, atrophy, weight loss. All of which could very much delay his growth and development. 
The couple appointments his mother did take him to, the doctors expressed alarm that his increased medication dose wasn‚Äôt doing its job, they were concerned she was not giving him his medication. Then she stopped taking him to his biweekly appts to monitor his thyroid and kidneys after only 2 months of having her baby home. She posted regularly about her wonderfully, peaceful life with her gentle, supportive partner; and occasionally she‚Äôd sprinkle in something about her ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù baby. She really threw around the word peaceful to describe her life, so it was extra shocking when in July of 2023 my nephew‚Äôs fianc√©e shot herself in the chest with a .45 Kimber. 

None of us knew what my nephew was privately going through. He felt weak and ashamed of his position, so he never shared just what was going on. He was fed up with covering for her abuse toward him and her self harm every time he didn‚Äôt agree with her. She‚Äôd be angry if he didn‚Äôt leave hickeys on her, or for stopping to talk to his friends for 15min would result in her filling his entire center console with water or she‚Äôd threaten suicide near constantly. 
He was worn down from constant drama and abusive control, but more importantly was the growing concern he had for his son. She would get so angry if he suggested taking the baby to the doctor for his concerns, or asked to take him out of his car seat. He worried his son wasn‚Äôt reaching any milestones because he was asleep all the time. His mother would rarely take him out of his car seat day and night. She wouldn‚Äôt allow him to have any assistance toys (walkers, jumpers, high chair) because of an alleged ‚Äúhip and skeletal deformation‚Äù. 
My nephew had done everything he could to make her happy, even going as far as carrying out a secret marriage. In April 2023 his fianc√©e told him he had 3 days to decide if he was going to marry her, or he would never see his son again. She also made the condition that he couldn‚Äôt tell his mom or anyone in his family. But he went through with the courthouse wedding for the sake of their child. 
She was extremely volatile and had a habit of hitting and throwing/breaking things, and slamming her head into walls when she wasn‚Äôt getting her way. She wasn‚Äôt even a vegan! She would order in burgers and steaks while he was at work. Mentioning the evidence caused fights. It was just easier for a teenager to suck it up and give into her. He suspected their son didn‚Äôt have hip or skeletal deformations, just the prescription helmet from not being held enough, which she never picked up from the doctor. He eventually found out all the things we tried to warn him of, such as she was never a nurse, her main job was the laundry room at a care facility. 

That day, my nephew (18m) had had enough of his wife‚Äôs (20f) abuse, erratic antics and absurd behavior. During the early morning hours on July, 14, after many hours a been drinking alcohol her father provided. They‚Äôd had a rough day of arguing over some flippant things. His wife (20f) seemed to be asleep, my nephew (18m) went to grab his phone to go to bed. He couldn‚Äôt find it so he grabbed hers to call it. He opened her phone, and saw incriminating conversations about her alcoholism and infidelity with other men. Rather than confront her, he decided to find his phone, and just sleep on the couch. He‚Äôd deal with it in the daylight. His wife woke up, found him on the couch and tried to get him to come to bed with her. He didn‚Äôt want to talk and refused to join her, so she began getting violent again, smashing things he worked for or treasured most. My nephew packed a bag and began to head to his mom‚Äôs home, when his wife told him to take their son with him. His wife(20f) oversaw him (18m) packing the diaper bag, walked them to the truck, and tried to hug/kiss him goodbye. My nephew rejected her affection and she scurried into the house, leaving the door open. My nephew, still loading the baby in the truck, saw his wife standing in the open doorway just a few feet away with her back facing toward him, when he heard the gunshot. A bullet whizzed past the truck and his bloody wife staggered out of the doorway and collapsed. My nephew raced into action getting towels and calling 911. 
A neighbor heard the commotion and came to help his young neighbors. He attempted to restrain and calm the combative, bloody woman on the ground while my nephew talked to 911 and applied pressure. The police and an ambulance came in time. The neighbor and his wife were there to help my nephew (18m) and his son (7mos) begin cleaning up scene of the shooting. My sister (38f) and her husband were out of town on a commercial fishing contract. 
She notified me what had happened as she was waiting on the first flight to Sitka. 
My nephew‚Äôs wife shot herself high enough in the chest that she collapsed her lung and did some permanent bone/muscle damage, but she was released from the hospital after a week, and into her father‚Äôs care. By then my nephew had filed for divorce, full custody, and a protection order. He was granted all of those things, and the custody went uncontested. In her own handwriting, my nephew‚Äôs ex wife (21f) stated she wanted 0% of her child‚Äôs time, 0 holidays or birthdays, and wanted to pay $0 for his care per month. Although she didn‚Äôt show up to court, the judge granted her 1 more chance for a hearing. When she didn‚Äôt show up to that custody hearing either, a warrant was issued and the judge granted her 1-4hrs of supervised or video visitation per week. My sister attempted to schedule these visits with her grandson‚Äôs mother multiple times, but her texts were ignored. My sister‚Äôs calls went to voicemail. A short time after she‚Äôd call, a third party would contact my sister and tell her to never contact the ex DIL again. When my sister‚Äôs family had wrapped up their fishing season, she scheduled an extended, out of state vacation with her whole family. This was not out of the norm for her, but it did include her son (19m) grandson (10mos).

When my sister, nephew, great-nephew were in WA, , his bio-mom decided to seek the revenge she‚Äôd been silently plotting. She convinced a domestic violence advocacy group she was a survivor of DV. The advocacy group helped her obtain a federal grant that provided her with legal counsel. This sent the bio-mom to a shady, underhanded attorney whose income is paid by legal grants like this. The attorney and my nephew‚Äôs ex wife began calling CPS in both Alaska and Washington states. They reported medical neglect, and custodial kidnapping. The claims were my nephew had moved out of state with their shared son and hadn‚Äôt taken him to his previous pediatrician‚Äôs in months. My sister (38f) was able to show proof that her grandson (11mos) was caught up on all his medical appointments at a different clinic she felt was better equipped for his medical needs. His mother had neglected him and that had caused him growth and development delays. He was beginning occupational therapy after he turned 1, and she‚Äôd gotten him enrolled in 2 different Native health clinics in the states before their trip. My sister had to end their Christmas vacation to fly back home for an emergency court hearing the bio mom (21f) had been granted. My great-nephew‚Äôs bio mother was claiming she was being denied her visitation and her child had been moved out of state without her knowledge. While my sister‚Äôs family was preparing to have the holidays at home in AK, CPS came to investigate the same claims as before. The investigators found a healthy, well attended baby, and proof he was being seen by physicians. 
Since then my sister and her son have been sent through the wringer with this woman. Wild claims and false accusations, and have had to attend a court hearing nearly every month. As some form of revenge, my nephew‚Äôs ex wife (21f) began dating my nephew‚Äôs boss‚Äô child (15m). This was exposed on Christmas Eve when a 17m driver was intoxicated and flipped his brand new Ford Raptor with 3 drunk passengers. The ex wife (21f), her sister (16f), & her just turned 16yo bf. That night, my nephew called my sister to report said accident. My sister called the non emergency line to Sitka PD to report the person who provided the alcohol, but was told they knew about her custody battle with the adult person involved. They informed her she would be arrested or  making false police reports if she called back. 
My sister then decided to inform the parents of the boys involved. Those parents tried reporting the 21yo woman for having a sexual relationship with their minor son. The mother had found video proof of the sexual relationship of an adult having sex with her child. The police wanted none of it. They told her the most they‚Äôd do was tell the woman to leave the 16yo boy alone. 
My nephew‚Äôs ex has been in multiple driving accidents, has been reported by multiple parents for having inappropriate relationships with young boys. She was showing up to my nephew‚Äôs work to take photos of his truck, the police ignored her breaking the protection ordered on 3 occasions. She brought in some half assed evidence of hickeys on her breasts and a swollen eye. She got Sitka PD to open a rape and assault case against my nephew. The ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù incident occurred over 2yrs before, and they completely ignored the protection order he had against her. They threatened to arrest him if he didn‚Äôt speak to them. 
The judge overseeing custody hearings eventually told my nephew he was essentially overreacting, and needed to put in more effort into co-parenting. The judge then dropped the protection order between my nephew and his ex, who had shot herself in the chest in front of him, subsequently endangering him and their son.
That same month, the 16yo my nephew‚Äôs ex was engaged to found out she was sleeping with a different teenage boy. He ended their relationship and obtained a restraining order to stop her from calling and showing up at his job anymore. The ex wife‚Äôs father and sister tried to convince the poor kid that she attempted suicide over their breakup, and was in the hospital. Since she couldn‚Äôt afford the dwelling alone, her father tried to reason that the young man should take over the lease his 22yo daughter had just signed for them. 
Currently this monster is raping a new minor. His parents have taken no action to prevent her from harming their son. 
I‚Äôve read accounts of this woman is trying to incite teenage boys into committing violence against her other teenage ex. She is spreading lies that he too raped her. She has refused to complete court ordered requirements for addiction therapy citing it would be unethical, as she is not an addict. She‚Äôs gotten professionals to block my sister‚Äôs family from receiving mental health services, as well as a counselor commit perjury at a custody hearing. This woman managed to have her opioid positive hair follicle testing results sealed for nearly a year to hide the fact she‚Äôs an active addict. She has lied and manipulated so many people and organizations with this shady attorney being paid for by a federal grant from their Native Tribe. 

No one is in a hurry to stop her, despite all the minors she‚Äôs already raped, harmed, or endangered. The Sitka detectives say they‚Äôre going to arrest her soon, they‚Äôre just building their case, but each passing week is agonizing. It seems like the chances of her stopping her legal crusade against my sister‚Äôs family is never ending. My niece has had to make sacrifices, and she‚Äôs been traumatized by this whole experience. She‚Äôs just starting high school, does tons of extra curricular activities with the tribe, and has her nephew in her home 6 days a week taking her parents‚Äô time and attention. No one has enjoyed the life they had before financial debt and emotional stress took over everything. I‚Äôm honestly scared to death for my great-nephew‚Äôs safety, and that this toxic predator is going to have unsupervised access to him. He‚Äôs almost 2yo and has to see 3 specialists to catch him up from the brain damage doctors say his mother caused. This woman is still using my nephew‚Äôs photos as her phone‚Äôs wall paper and screensaver. It‚Äôs especially uncomfortable since they‚Äôve been officially divorced since September of 2023 and their only contact allowed through a parenting app the judge can view. I guess I‚Äôm wondering if we‚Äôre overreacting. Or if anyone else been through this? I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions or comments, I have the receipts to back all of these claims. 

TL;DR my nephew was manipulated into reproducing with a child predator who shot herself in the chest/shoulder, and has made our family‚Äôs lives hell ever since. Is anyone else going through something this? She‚Äôs filed for more DV charges as of today. How do we combat this?",0,1731465075.0,legaladviceofftopic,7,0.33,False

I was diagnosed with pelvic floor dysfunction 4 years ago, but my symptoms actually began about 6 years ago. I‚Äôve always been very regular with my bowel movements, usually going right after my coffee without thinking much about it. Then, out of nowhere, I became completely constipated. I had the urge to go but could only pass small, pencil-thin stools and never felt fully empty.

I started seeing doctor after doctor, because constipation seemed to bring on a host of other issues. I developed acid reflux, frequent urinary tract infection-like symptoms (which would disappear once I was able to have a bowel movement), bloating, gas, and hemorrhoids from all the straining. I was miserable.

Finally, in 2020, I was diagnosed with pelvic floor dysfunction. I was referred to physical therapy for about six months (which, unfortunately, wasn‚Äôt covered by insurance, so I ended up spending thousands). I did see improvements and got about 80% better, but I‚Äôve never felt the same since.

I work out and stretch regularly, and I take Metamucil almost every day. Some days are better than others, but I still have to wake up about two hours earlier than usual just to get my bowels moving. I constantly fear that I‚Äôm going backwards, but when I have a good bowel movement, my day feels so much better. I still don‚Äôt feel fully emptied, but it‚Äôs better than it used to be.

I‚Äôm 56 female and recently I started wondering if this could actually be more related to menopause and hormone changes than pelvic floor dysfunction or did menopause cause my Pelvic floor problems? I‚Äôve been reading about hormone replacement therapy and am considering it, as it might help me feel like I‚Äôm back to 100%.

I don‚Äôt experience any pain, which I know is common with pelvic floor dysfunction, so that‚Äôs always been a bit confusing to me. Has anyone had similar symptoms? If so, did you ever recover completely? Would love to hear your thoughts.",1,1731464864.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

Had no contact since 2017 and he reached out to me in February 2022, because his father passed. He told me how much his father loved me,  and I went to the funeral since I had no issues with the father. 
It followed with a text of it would be nice to have a coffee to catch up. Coffee turned into consistent contact since January 2023. During the past year and half, he would call, the convos where nice, he even wanted to sit next to me when my dad passed in May this year, buys sex toys, brings food,  text me random etc.

He had a son and basically was a Covid baby, they broke up shortly after and he TOLD me did everything he had to do to make it work according to him and it was done done. 

During our first encounter after no contact, he never directly apologized for how he did me wrong but said a bunch of things and summed it to the fact that our relationship ended not for lack of love but for been ill equipeded as young individuals in our 20s. 
Now, there's so much I can't make sense of.

I wont lie that my desire has always been for us to reconcile. 

Up until September, after being on me like it was his last day on earth, videocalling, asking me to bring him cake etc, afterwards proceeds to tell me we're not going to see each other as much. I didn't get it. Later, I deducted that he moved out of his place cause he let slip that he just bought his new patio set, and he didn't even tell me he moved.  He then went on vacation on October, and text me at 2:30am good night beautiful, and when I replied in the  morning, he proceeds to answer: how is my son???? Like WTF??  Like is it me or is it obvious obvious he either moved back with his baby mom.  Yet, you still proceed to engage with me, sleep with me, ask me when am I making you diner?,  good morning I dreamt of you all night, I want to bring the dog to see you, I'm mad at you cause we haven't seen each other in a week etc.
 
He is now slowly ghosting me since, no contact, and didn't even make eye contact the last time we saw each other and I'm here crying like crazy. Instead of one uncomfortable moment to admit and own to his shortcomings, he chooses a lifetime of resentment, rejection and abandonment which is why we broke up. No accountability,  just avoidance even after all this time, it's the same.

I spent years trying to heal, went back to school, got my relationship with God, just trying to be better overall and get back to a sense of normal after the divorce but this betrayal this time it hurts so bad.

For the past couple months, my sleep has been getting progressively worse. It started with just having trouble falling asleep at my usual time (10:30PM), then it crept to midnight, then 2AM... but now it's gotten completely out of hand.

These days, I try to get to bed by 11PM, but I end up just staring at my ceiling for hours. My body feels exhausted, but my mind refuses to shut down. Up until last week, I was at least managing to drift off by 3AM or so, which wasn't great but I could deal with it.

But this past week has been absolute hell. I'm on my fifth consecutive night of being wide awake until 7AM. When I say wide awake, I mean WIDE awake - like ""just had three espressos"" levels of alertness (which I definitely haven't - I don't even drink coffee after noon). I eventually crash around 7-8AM and sleep until about 11AM, then drag myself through the day feeling like a zombie, only to repeat the whole cycle again.

The most frustrating part? I'll be dead tired at 10PM, but the moment my head hits the pillow, it's like my brain gets a second wind and decides it's party time. I've resorted to just staying up and watching YouTube because lying in bed doing nothing was making me crazy.

I'm a grad student, so I can technically manage with a weird schedule, but I'm falling behind on research and missing morning meetings. My ideal schedule would be sleeping from 11PM to 7AM, but at this point, I'd settle for ANY consistent sleep pattern that aligns with the sun.

Should I try sleep medications? Melatonin? Those sleepy-time teas everyone keeps recommending? Should I pull a 24-hour reset and power through until the next night? I'm desperate for any suggestions at this point.

I often have to drive a minimum of 30 minutes to get from one court to the other. So it doesn't make sense for me to leave a court, drive 30 minutes to the office only to be there for 1-2 hours, and drive another 30 minutes to the other court.

For context JP courts are often described as being their own little island‚Äîmy supervisors don‚Äôt have access to the system and don‚Äôt know my schedule, there is no oversight, etc. The cases I deal with are Class C offenses.

He has never told me that I need to communicate more and never brought this to my attention. He never even gave a speck of a hint that it was an issue.

So I have made the decision to make sure I communicate ‚Ä¶ EVERYTHING! I already plan to email him regarding my docket, the cases that are scheduled that day, the outcome of those cases, etc. Some days, it will be a LONG email and other days it will be many short emails. I may forgot to insert the attachment and have to send another email with the attachment. I will also make sure to bury any truly important information in the middle of the email.

I also plan to ask the secretaries ‚Äúto tell my boss [insert information] next time you see him.‚Äù When he gets used to the emails, I‚Äôll also incorporate some texts if something requires ‚Äúimmediate attention.‚Äù I may also leave a sealed envelope on his desk with a typed out schedule of that week every now and then.

I do need to be cautious about sending unnecessary information because I don‚Äôt want him to use that as a reason to deny me a raise in the future. Knowing this asshole, it's something he would do.

However, this doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs enough. I want to do more!!! So I have decided to come to Reddit to ask for help. Please drop some of the best ideas you have!

Controversial Prop. 65 warning labels about toxic chemicals are effective, study says

For nearly 40 years, a controversial California law has required companies to place warning labels on their products alerting consumers to the potential health threats posed by chemicals, or else face lawsuits from lawyers, private citizens and advocacy groups.
Passed as a ballot initiative, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 has resulted in warnings being affixed to everything from vinyl-covered Bibles to gas station pumps, advising that exposure to some 900 chemicals can cause cancer, birth defects or reproductive harm. 
Ever since the passage of Proposition 65, policymakers and business groups have argued over whether the law is effective in preventing people from ingesting and inhaling toxic chemicals, or just providing a payday to plaintiffs attorneys.
Now, a new study published in Environmental Health Perspectives has concluded that Proposition 65 has curbed exposure to toxic substances in California ‚Äî and nationally.
‚ÄúIf you live in California, the warnings are everywhere,‚Äù said Kristin Knox, a senior researcher at the Silent Spring Institute, a nonprofit that investigates the links between breast cancer and chemicals found in consumer products and the environment. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre on all sorts of stuff. So it‚Äôs very easy for people to make fun of Prop. 65 because you‚Äôre like, there‚Äôs warnings on my coffee and in my parking garage. But, for us, that made it even more important to be able to go and see if it‚Äôs having effects.‚Äù

Farm pesticides found floating in California air samples; state officials say it‚Äôs OK
California officials insist that pesticide air samples remained within healthy limits. However, environmentalists say the state is downplaying the risk.
Oct. 25, 2024
The study, conducted by Silent Spring and UC Berkeley researchers, suggests the law helped to reduce exposure to toxic substances commonly found in diesel exhaust and plastic materials. 
In order to gauge the law‚Äôs effectiveness, study authors examined the prevalence of chemicals found in blood and urine samples collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The researchers analyzed concentrations of 11 chemicals placed on the Proposition 65 warning list and monitored by the CDC between 1999 and 2016. They included several types of phthalates, chemicals used to make plastics flexible; chloroform, a toxic byproduct from disinfecting water with chlorine; and toluene, a hazardous substance found in vehicle exhaust. 
They found that the majority of samples had significantly lower concentrations of these chemicals after their listing. But the levels didn‚Äôt just decline in California, they fell nationwide. 
However, California residents had lower chemical levels compared to the rest of the U.S., possibly due to more stringent environmental regulations and consumer awareness, according to researchers.
Study authors surmised that the concentrations fell, in part, because businesses removed the chemicals from their goods to avoid warning labels. 
‚ÄúIt sounds like they reformulate to avoid having to put a Prop. 65 label on their product,‚Äù Knox said. ‚ÄúBut when they reformulate, they reformulate nationwide. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going to make a product just for California. And so this state regulation is actually having a national impact.‚Äù
But swapping one chemical for an unlisted substitute has sometimes resulted in its own consequences. 
For example, when bisphenol A, an ingredient in plastics, was listed in 2013, chemical concentrations in blood and urine samples subsequently fell by 15%. However, that was followed by a 20% rise in bisphenol S ‚Äî a closely related chemical also linked with reproductive toxicity.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what we want to see, and that‚Äôs an argument for regulating chemicals as a class, rather than specific chemicals,‚Äù Knox said.

Port of Los Angeles receives unprecedented $400-million grant to electrify operations
The grant is part of a larger $3-billion initiative to deploy zero-emission equipment at the nation‚Äôs ports, which are significant sources of pollution. 
Oct. 29, 2024
Business leaders have long been skeptical of Proposition 65‚Äôs effectiveness. They argue that the extensive list of chemicals has led to nearly universal warnings, which they say has undermined the law‚Äôs original intent and given consumers warning fatigue. 
Since 2010, companies have settled more than $200 million in Proposition 65-related lawsuits, according to the California Chamber of Commerce. Proposition 65, they say, has resulted in a cottage industry of so-called bounty hunters that target California companies for payouts.
‚ÄúProp. 65 is infamous for its ubiquitous warnings and its bounty hunters who have abused the law to shake down businesses,‚Äù Adam Regele, vice president of advocacy for CalChamber, said in a statement. 
‚ÄúFor many chemicals, it requires warnings at levels 1,000 times below the level known to cause no effect in animal studies. It therefore should come as no surprise that listing a chemical under Prop. 65 prompts businesses to avoid it ‚Äî if they can. The more important question is whether these changes have any public health benefit, and particularly at what cost to consumers.‚Äù
Experts say some of the legal action is warranted and paved the way for reform.
Dr. Meg Schwarzman, a physician and environmental scientist at UC Berkeley, said Proposition 65 has encouraged regulation that has reduced air pollution. Diesel was recognized as a carcinogen and listed under Proposition 65 in 1990. 
Several lawsuits were lodged against businesses, including school bus manufacturers and a major grocery chain. Perhaps the most notable was filed by then California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, who sued tenants at the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach for failure to warn residents that diesel emissions can cause cancer. 
Not long after its Proposition 65 designation, the California Air Resources Board classified diesel exhaust as a toxic air contaminant, enabling the agency to regulate it. It later adopted a number of rules curtailing diesel pollution in heavy-duty trucks and equipment at ports.
From 1990 to 2014, diesel emissions dropped by 78% in California, compared with 51% nationally.
‚ÄúCalifornians have lower body burdens of many known toxic chemicals than people living outside of here,‚Äù said Schwarzman. ‚ÄúAnd that shows that whatever combination of our environmental laws targeting toxics is having an effect.‚Äù

I‚Äôve used BM Swiss coffee before in my son‚Äôs nursery. I can‚Äôt remember it exactly but I knew I liked it. It was bright and creamy but it still looked white and it looked great with gold accessories. Would it look good with black?

I‚Äôve also read good things about BM white dove. Would it look good with black?

I find BM simply white too bright to go with black - we have it in our bedroom master bath and laundry. 

So with a glossy toilet, glossy white vanity, and black trims (faucets, light, mirror, window, cabinet) - which shade of white/creamy white would you recommend based on your previous experiences? OR would a completely different colour work here? I am open to any and every idea.

1gq26lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gq26lt/help_me_m37_understand_this_friendship_with_my/,"Help me (M/37) understand this ""friendship"" with my friend (F/36) of 10 years (long read)?","I (M, 37) have known this woman (36) for a little over ten years. We met at our then-work, and became friends fairly quickly. She left after a little while but we stayed in contact, and would occasionally hang out outside work (coffee or drinks). Both in relationships at the time, and though I did feel some attraction towards her, I wasn't compelled to act on it. Genuinely don't think I ever acted as though I was attracted to her when we were around another, but then an outside perspective on those situations might say different. 

Fast-forwarded a couple of years and we are both in the process of leaving long-term relationships. I'm already casually seeing someone else. One weekend we end up spending a day together, going to various places. There's part of me maybe hoping something will happen, but I don't feel like I'm getting any positive signs, so I don't mind leaving things as they are. We end up watching a movie and it's so boring I start to fall asleep. Bear in mind I've been moving everything out of my apartment for several of the previous days and am dead tired.

I go to her room while she's still watching the movie with her housemate (gay), sit on the bed fully clothed, tell myself I'll just catch a quick 10min power nap and then leave. Of course, I fall asleep instantly. I wake up to her entering the room. Kinda groggy, I think I state I can pop out to the couch - this is 7 or 8 years ago now, mind you, I can't recall all the details. She says ""don't take this the wrong way, but you can take your pants off if you want"". I do, and we both go to sleep. I don't, of course; I'm pretty awake now. We're not touching. After a while I calm down and fall back asleep. 

We wake up cuddling, that is, me spooning her. It doesn't feel particularly sexual. After a while of I kinda roll away and she soon she comes over and cuddles up to me. Again, doesn't feel especially sexual even though her legs are draped over mine. 

Mind you, we had a conversation, weeks prior to this about relationships. She asked something along the lines of how I felt about her. I tell her there are things I like about her. Her response is that she's not interested in dating me and doesn't see me that way. Fair enough, I think (and say). I don't feel especially disappointed and life goes on. Until the cuddling. 

The next morning we ask each other what this is all about (the cuddling). I respond, wanting to seem nonchalant, and respectful of what she's said previously, ""does it have to mean anything?"". A disingenuous thing for me to say at the time. I add that it ""probably wouldn't have happened if you didn't like me a little bit"", to which she responds ""true"". We go out for breakfast and don't really talk about it. Life goes on.

When we see each other again a week or two later the issue comes up straight away. She mentions she spoke to her best friend about it. The friend said ""He's hot, you should date him"". She says she acknowledged this but told the friend she doesn't see me that way. Again, fair enough. Less and less I'm expecting anything to come from this. Soon after that we meet up for a drink or two. Unsolicited, she offers that she'd asked herself if she could imagine herself kissing me, and that she couldn't. Not feeling like pushing a romantic angle here, I probably laugh it off. My friend, who also knows her, maintains that this woman definitely has some kind of a crush on me, despite my mentioning that she expressed apparent complete disinterest in dating me.

Soon after that we're each in different relationships. We keep in touch semi-frequently. I end up moving interstate and sometimes months and months go by without us texting. 

One time, during a phone call she mentions she's dating someone new. I'm surprised and happy for her. She then mentions a conversation she'd had with a friend where she they'd spoken about co-parenting. She says she'd immediately thought of me as the person she'd want to co-parent this hypothetical kid with. My immediate reaction is to feel a bit surprised, flattered. The conversation moves on. 

In other texts over the months and years every non and then she'll bookend a text with a mention that she misses me - sounds weird, but It feels like the kind of thing people say to friends as a sort of polite thing? I dunno. I'm in a relationship at the time, and it doesn't feel right to reciprocate that kind of statement, so I don't, even if I feel it.

Other times she'll invite me on trips just with her, not mentioning my partner in the invitiation, knowing full-well I'm in a relationship. Again, to me, there's a certain naive-innocent quality to all this that I know, in my gut, doesn't add up. Every time i mention these situations to other people, they say the same thing: this person is into me.

The other thing is frequency of contact. I can predict quite accurately when she's coming out of a relationship (there have been two or three for her in the last 7-8 years) as she'll initiate contact a lot more. Otherwise, I feel it's usually myself initiating the contacts or calls, when they happen. I don't believe she's ever called me out of the blue. just texts. And when the texts taper off, she's usually going into something new again. In this context, I feel quite used. As though she's hedging her bets or something. 

Anyway, this has been on my mind a little as I'm moving back to her city with my now partner, so I've mentioned this to her. She'll be part of my life to a somewhat increased extent. I know I'm happy and invested in what I have, and I'm not looking for anything from her.

I had UTI symptoms yesterday but none today, should I still see a doctor?","Hi all, so I woke up at 4am yesterday with pelvic pain & having to pee bad, but when I went to pee hardly anything came out. My immediate thought was ‚Äúoh no‚Äù‚Ä¶ my pelvic area was hurting and still nothing else was coming out. I went back to bed and laid there in discomfort/pain still, and went back to the bathroom another 2 times where I‚Äôd sit for 10 minutes and literal drops came out. 

In the morning, I finally could pee but I would have a slight pain after I was done (not stinging, just an odd pain down there). Throughout the day, the pain lessened and lessened. Now today (day 2) I‚Äôm was work and didn‚Äôt feel anything I don‚Äôt think. I‚Äôve been drinking water (not a lot but usually I have coffee so of course I couldn‚Äôt have that today and have been having water, which is better anyway). 

I don‚Äôt have insurance anymore and my local urgent care quoted me $225 for a visit for UTI urine sample and a prescription. Doesn‚Äôt cover cost of the medicine prescribed. 

Should I still see a doctor??? I know there is slight risks for untreated UTIs.. 

This isn‚Äôt my first time and I‚Äôm confused about why this one is so much less extreme than the last. My first UTI  was about 1-2 years ago, and symptoms lasted for days and it was very bad stinging  pain every time I used the bathroom. I was on the medicine that turns your pee orange I believe. 

One thing about me and what I believe to be the reason for both UTI‚Äôs, since I was a little girl I‚Äôve had a terrible habit of holding my pee until I‚Äôm ‚Äúdancing‚Äù or bouncing my legs. Family and friends and even my boss have always told me ‚Äúgo pee!‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure why I do this, just something in my brain tells me I need to finish what I‚Äôm doing first/it can wait.

A random but possibly relevant detail? I‚Äôve been saying for a long time now that I think I have a small bladder. I don‚Äôt know when this happened but I noticed that I have to pee so much more frequently than others. I feel ashamed by it and especially at work I feel it makes me look bad because I cannot have a few sips of water without having to go. And if I don‚Äôt drink water I get migraines ü´† 

Another possibly relevant detail: I‚Äôve been drinking alcohol just about every day this past week, if that matters at all, 2-3 drinks a day. Usually I only drink 3-4 days (not any better I know).

At one point I texted her and said that meeting up didn‚Äôt have to be a big deal, let‚Äôs just have a quick coffee after work. She said she was depressed and not up to it. Okay, fine.

There were a few other mentions of activities that never came to pass, then I ran into her at Christmas and she mentioned starting a book club and I should go buy a specific book and start reading it in preparation. I nodded and smiled and did no such thing.  As the famous line in the show Yellowjackets goes, there was no book club. 

Or at least, I never actually ended up being invited to these things.

My visit also coincided with the Seoul Cafe Show, through which I discovered even more local, as well as national roasters.

Below is a list of the 13 (!) cafes I visited, starting with in-house roasters. I linked to their IG pages where available.

***Roasters***

* [**Alto Coffee Bar**](https://www.instagram.com/alto_coffeebar/): Small, sleek shop near Insadong. Limited indoor and outdoor seating. Closest subway stations are Anguk and Jongno 3.
* [**Felt**:](https://www.instagram.com/felt_seoul/) I've heard this is another premier name in Seoul. There are a couple of other locations; I went to the one that's in the basement of an office building ('Tower D') near Gwanghwamun station. Limited seating in the designated cafe space, but plenty right outside. Mingle with office workers!
* [**Fritz**](https://www.instagram.com/fritzcoffeecompany/): The first coffee Korean coffee roaster I'd heard of. In the U.S., you can sometimes get their beans from either [Kumquat ](https://www.kumquatcoffee.com/s/shop)or [Dayglow](https://dayglow.coffee/collections/craft-coffee-1). I went to the branch at the Arario Museum (although I didn't go to the museum itself). I'm very much a breakfast person, and this is one of the few places in the area that's open at 9 am...with breakfast pastries.
* [**Hakrim Coffee**](https://www.instagram.com/hakrim_coffee/): Seoul's oldest active cafe! My friends offered to take me to the original location on Daehak-ro (at Hyehwa station, Line 4), but ofc, it was crowded. We went around to the 2nd location, not even 2 minutes away on foot. Great affogato.
* [**Hit**](https://www.instagram.com/hitcoffee_official/): I visited the location in Seongyo-dong (Ma-po), but I think they have other locations around town. Also offers pastries. According to my friend who lives around the corner, this is one of the more popular cafes in the neighborhood (and there are plenty of them).
* [**Pastel Coffee Works**](https://www.instagram.com/pastelcoffeeworks/): Another petite shop, this time down from Tongin Market. I went twice, and also bought a sampler trio of beans.
* [**Reflect**](https://www.instagram.com/reflect_coffee/): I didn't actually get to visit the shop in person. However, I did get to taste some of their work at this year's Cafe Show, and was pleased to get a 200g bag of [Ombligon](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2023/08/what-is-ombligon-variety-coffee/).

***Cafes***

* [**Cafe Hooamdong**](https://www.instagram.com/cafe_hooamdong/): Neighborhood cafe in Huam-dong that may also roast in-house. Serves non-coffee beverages as well. One of the few that I visited whose decor wasn't screaming uber-cool, minimalist specialty coffee, lol.
* [**Cafe de Luang**](https://www.instagram.com/cafe_de_luang/): Google Maps show this as Magpie Coffee, but at the time of visit, Luang was in ts place. Tasty financiers, and I took away a large (I mean, US-sized) latte!
* [**Ha House**](https://www.instagram.com/hahouse_/): In Itaewon, one of numerous trendy places in so called 'coffee alley,' and the polar opposite of the cafe mentioned above.
* [**Leedorim**](https://www.instagram.com/leedorim.seoul/): Frequently seen on social media, an 'aesthetic' cafe with delightful **vegan** pastries, west of Gyeongbukgung Palace. Ample seating across three floors. The cafe concept is in homage to King Sejong (the creator of Hangeul, born in the area, featured on the 10,000 KRW bill) but very few probably care about that.

Ok so for background/context on Baily and I.....  
Baily has been in my life for all of her life and 21 of mine. Moms grew up best friends and stayed that way even now. I grew up in Minnesota until I was 17 and finally had the opportunity to move with my grandparents in Wiscosin. I stayed in touch with many of my friends from the cities but over time lost many of them due to petty reasons. Baily started having troubles with alcohol and other subtsances in highschool and ended up getting multiple charges and went through quite a lot with her family and herself until about a year ago. She really started to get on the straight and narrow and do what she had to do. Because of seeing people in my life growing up have issues with alcohol in specific as well as messing up the first year of our daughters life, I chose not to drink and am sober of alcohol. That is important.

Ok now for my husband...

My husband (22) and I have been together for 6 years and married for 2. We were young and dumb and I got pregnant a little over a month into our relationship. He struggled with the bad M word (that is what I call it but i think we all know what substance that might be-(He said some call it Math??)) he got sober about a month before we met but clearly he had other stuff. Many years people told me to leave him and I deserve better. I do dont get me wrong but thats a big thing he has been working on. Nobody wants to take on a project man but it just so happens that I fell in love with him. Between years of therapy and trying medication we have gotten diagnosis that have always made sense to me but were clearly shockers to him. Most of his providers believe to be IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder). Cut to 5 years later and he knows all my family and friends obviously, which includes Baily and they all know how hard he has worked on himself for myself and our daughter.

Alright and now the story...

In September we allowed Baily to move in with us since we have been doing fairly good the past 2 years. Our home life was more stable than it had ever been, we were both working jobs and our daughter had started school. Baily had also had a really good plan with her probation officer and had really good goals in place with motivation rolling. So we had no reason to say no. Thursday my husband and I both had off of work and drove up to MN to go get Baily. All went ok getting her stuff into our car and we started our 3 hour dive back to WI. About 20 minutes in Baily ""needed"" to stop to get drinks in order to ""survive this trip"". We stopped and she got 3 tall boy Twisted Teas. 2 hours after we stopped... only 45 minutes left to our trip she needed to stop to get more drinks. She walks out with 3 more tall boys and we continue on with our drive. We arrive home and unpack the car and get her room all arranged. I had a couple bags of move in / welcome gifts ready for her to open because clearly I was so exited for us all to be together. 2 red dresses that were very much her taste, fuzzy slippers with studs on them and a couple other things, one being a package of tall boots that had not arrived yet.

\*\*\*\*Important Note: This was our county fair weekend which started on Wednesday. Its a pretty big deal in our area and most people go every night. The entire fair grounds is ALCOHOL FREE

Oh.... but not before stopping at the Kwik Trip to get her 4 more tall boy Twisted Teas.... Mind you am still not worried about the drinking at this point. My brain was justifying this as ""she just up and moved her whole life to another state, I would want a couple drinks if I had been through what she had"". My husband however was already a little suspicious. telling me ""hey thats her 6th..."" and stuff like that.

**FRIDAY MORNING!!!**¬†I get to work and day goes well. Most businesses in town let employees have a paid half day to go to the fair with their kids so natually off I went to collect our daughter from school and head home to get ready for the fair. Baily was home doing nails and makeup getting ready and my husband got home from work about 30 minutes after I did. He walked in with a Kwik Trip bag and you know what it is already. 4 tall boy Twisted Teas. Baily texted him asking him to pick them up for her to ""survive the fair night"" and its ""bullshit they dont let alcohol in"" ""I thought this was Wisconsin"" and on.

So as we watched Baily pour these drinks into a big Bubba water bottle and stuck the other two in her purse. By the time we got back into town (10 minute drive) she needed to stop to grab 2 drinks. Out I walk this time with 2 more tall boys. I am still not worried with Bailys drinking and start now saying ""she just wants to have fun"" ""she has never been to anything like this"" along woth continuing the ""she just lost everything she knew"" narrative.

Looking back I feel so bad I didnt listen to my husband especially as this story goes along. Through the night he continued to express his concerns. Escpecially with his improved relationships with the Sherrifs and PD's over the past couple years. Like I said he has worked so hard and even made ammends through our relationship to the law enforcment who delt with him as a teenager so I could see why it made him nervous / upset. We ended up leaving after the grandstand event (tractor pulls) at 9:00 and stopped at... you guessed it.... Kwik Trip for more drinks. Baily walked out with 4 more tall boy Twisted Teas and we headed home. Our dughter was already asleep so the 3 of us watched Blended (Adam Sandler movie)

**Saturday... The best day of the fair - Demo Derby**

We wake up and I noticed 2 of the Twisted Teas were still in the fridge from last night. We eat and because it is sleepover night for our daughter at my grandparents we drop her off around 10:00AM and go back home to clean until for time. My grandma and daughter go to the fair for the day and the 3 of us head to the fair around 3:00 since we got most of the cleaning done. Its Demo Derby night at the fair which is the best. Before we leave when the hair and makeup is all done and my husband is rushing us to get out the door, I fill my iced coffee and suck down a couple sips to refill for the car to have maximum caffeine affect and and I hear ""were gonna stop at Kwik Trip for some drinks right because im not going if I cant have my drinks.""

My husband shoots me the fastest glare. Baily had drank the last 2 drinks while we were cleaning.... So we stop... She goes in.... Out comes a bag with 4 tall boy Twisted Teas. She pours 2 into the Bubba and the other two go in her bag. I swear it was like I was in a movie. I looked up at my husband and it hit me. She never stopped drinking... if she did... its not stopping now...

We get to the fair around 3:45 ate mini doughnuts and all the goodies. Say hi to all the people on our walk around the fair (its really small you its eat, ride, walk, new drink, eat, ride, walk) and before we know it its 6:00 and Baily is out. Im talking out out. Like slurping on the Bubba trying to get every last sip out. We head to the car to refill with her last two drinks because Demo Derby starts at 7:00.

by 7:30 Baily is plastered. Drunk. Heavily intoxicated. She is walking herself to the car but not without being suspisous af about it. I was already thinking about how to handle this when we get home. How do I tone her down? Calm her down? Stopped at the Kwik Trip and got 4 more.... I am scared. We get home though and I offer to play a card game. My husband doesnt play card games but his friend well call him Lane was spending the night too for a bonfire and a couple beers with my husband so he joined in as he could tell it was needed for mood lightener on the rest of us.

We started with a game of speed. Wrong choice. We got through 2 rounds and after my cards ended up in Baily's mouth along with her just being a little too ""mean"" with the cards I had remembered that she loved Garbage and played it when she was is jail that one week a couple years ago. Garbage is slower and not as intense. My playing cards got bit again. Like put in her mouth and bit. I leaned into her and lowered my voice because at that time Lane and my husband were having their own little conversation. I said very calmly ""Hey you gotta tone it down a little bit. Im getting pretty anxious and I know your a fun drunk and all"" To which Baily very sharply responded to with ""Im not drunk!!!""

Lane and my husband looked over at us but hubby got the hint and continued his cconversation. I stay leaned in and say ""Girl you know especially with my mom like our moms like I know what drunk versus buzzed is. Its ok to be drunk right now I just need you to tone it down like a little bit because im pretty anxious"". Baily very quickly got up said : Fuck that I am not fucking drunk and im not going to let some sober sally tell me whos drunk...."" mumbled on as she walked to the fridge and came back to crack another tall boy and proceeds to chug half of it right infront of us. The boys... Shocked... Still sober...looked at me. I wear the fucking pants in the house so I was suppposed to know what to do in this situation I guess.

I said "" No no its ok Im sorry im just going to go up to bed. Its like my bed time anyways"" with a little chuckle. My husband walked right over to me and walked me upstairs while she mumbled under her breath things about me saying shes drunk and whatnot. It is 10:30 PM so it really isnt that late. I mean I was tired dont get me wrong but I was looking forward to a fun night. We talked in bed for a couple minutes. I saw where he was coming from and I apologized I brushed it off. He thanked me for handling it well and asked if I really did want to go to bed. I told him I did because he knows I will sleep anywhere anytime and it was late for me. We made a plan to talk to her Sunday morning (next morning) about the drinking before we got our daughter from my grandparents. About 20 minutes later he went downstairs and made the bonfire and him, Lane and Baily chilled outside.

Around midnight I woke up with a dry ass mouth and a need for a ball of crushed, balled up white bread. I text my husband and ask for those two things. I heard him walk in the house and come upstairs with my things, sat down and asked if I was ok. I was passed tf out so yea I'm fantastic. I ask him the same. He was annoyed because him and Lane hadnt been able to have any of the Busch Lattes yet because they were essentially babysitting Baily. I wished him luck and offered to help get her to bed and he said ""nah"" hes ""got it, like a big boy.""

**1:35AM**¬†Hubby comes in worried somethings going to happen with Baily. Im asleep. Like I barley remember this I just remember him asking for advice like how others would handle her in the past. She was arguing about something with the alcohol.

**1:41AM**¬†was the time I looked at my phone.

I assume she busted my door down not even 2 minutes before this.

Screaming about how her and my husband had slept together 4 times and something about the color purple. I immediatly go to the car to leave. Like i just get downstairs and grab my keys and walk outside. Baily was trying to block me from my garage door to get into the garage. Pull out of the garage and I dont have my phone. I get out and as my husband is standing next to me following me inside to get my phone Baily full on tackles. And im talking NFL takedown or whatever. my husband. He doesnt hit the ground he knows how to handle his weight especially growing up with 4 brothers doing that same move. I saw him essentially pry her off him and I continue to walk inside to grab my phone.

I hear Lane on the phone with the cops at this point and now I know I have to go more than ever. I walk back to the car and as my husband is blocking Baily from getting to my drivers door I see her rip his shirt right off him. Like she ran infront of him and with her full might ripped his shirt right off him. Looking back it was crazy funny that I saw something straight out of a movie. I drive away. I go to my grandparents 30 minutes away where my daughter is. I turned off my phone and I went to sleep.

Next Day

I wake up at 9:30 something. My grandma greets me with an ""are you ok?"" and I go oh he hit you up. We talked for a while and she takes my husbands side. This is a very RARE thing for her. She explains he had called the Sherrifs that morning and begged them to come show me the screenshots form her phone and his phone and whatnot. He knew his past he knew what was at stake and he knew who he is/was. Thankfully thay know the improvements hes made in his life and how hard he has worked for his family (our daughter and I). These screenshots showed that since June (3 Months) Baily had been sending messages like ""I can treat you better"" ""I can actaully cook for you"" (I have never been a cook and dont trust me with fire lol My husband loves that though because he is a chef and lives to cook some damn good meals) ""We could make a beautiful life"" and..... how SHE could be HIS color purple.... dumb B tried to turn it on him at 1 in the morning. He had been turning her down and telling her we arnt going to let her move in and he will tell me what she is saying and I am her best friend and how could she. On and On. For 3 months.

\*\*\*Note: I do not discount his part in this. We have had our talks and have made our peace and have celebrated his honesty. He did the wrong this by not telling me and allowing me to let her move in. I wear the pants and really whatever I say went but if he wouldn't have hid it we wouldnt have gone throguh this. Hes lucky they got the screenshots.

I went to talk to my husband the next day but Bailys dad came down that night to grab as much of her stuff as possible. I gave Baily hugs and kept my mouth shut. I said by and gave her another hug. She wanted them and I cant say no... thats my best friend. I dont know why she would lie to me. Even if its the alcohol.

**November now**¬†and all her shit that didnt get taken is still here. My brother is going to be here in a week for Thanksgiving. He says 2 weeks but switches between our grandparents and our place. We needed that room cleaned out and since her dad hasnt responded yet we moved it all to the garage today. I kept out the pair of boots that arrived 2 days after this all happened. I put them in my closet room. We have the same size feet and I have always wanted a pair of boots like that anyways. I got them for her though and I would feel so bad to just not have them in her pile of stuff when someone comes back to get it. I feel like if I keep them I just wont want to wear them because they ""arnt mine"" even though.... I mean they are I bought them. But like I got them for her with her in mind as a welcome to WI gift. So much other stuff too but it really is about the boots.

I‚Äôll be real with you; I‚Äôve tried all sorts of products that claim to improve dental health. I‚Äôve used expensive toothpaste brands, whitening kits, and mouthwash solutions that promise big results but usually fall short. My oral health journey felt like an endless cycle of disappointment until I came across something that changed the game entirely‚Äîa new supplement designed to truly improve oral health from the inside out.

When I first came across this product, I was skeptical. ‚ÄúAnother supplement,‚Äù I thought, ‚ÄúJust like the others, only with fancy claims.‚Äù But what struck me was how it focused on nurturing beneficial bacteria in the mouth, which is key to achieving lasting dental health. Here‚Äôs the thing: Most oral health products focus on what goes on the outside‚Äîcleaning and whitening‚Äîbut very few address the root causes that lie within. This supplement does just that.

My routine with it was simple. Every morning, I‚Äôd chew one of these tablets. It quickly became part of my daily habit, just like brushing. I didn‚Äôt expect immediate results, but within a week, I noticed my mouth felt fresher throughout the day, even hours after my morning coffee. This was just the beginning.

By the second week, I realized my gums felt less sensitive. I‚Äôd often had issues with soreness, especially after eating certain foods, and this supplement seemed to work wonders in calming that discomfort. It was almost strange how quickly my gums seemed to regain their health. I remember thinking, ‚ÄúIs this really happening?‚Äù

But the real moment of truth came when I went to my dentist for a check-up. I‚Äôd been dreading this visit because I always seemed to get some news about plaque buildup or gum issues. This time, though, my dentist seemed almost surprised. My gums were healthier, my teeth looked stronger, and there was significantly less plaque than he had seen in previous appointments. He actually asked if I‚Äôd changed anything in my routine. That was when I knew I was onto something that worked.

The formula is packed with probiotics and essential vitamins‚Äîeverything my mouth was apparently missing all along. Instead of just masking symptoms, it goes to the root of dental health, promoting a balanced bacterial environment. And you know what‚Äôs wild? My morning breath started improving too. I had just assumed bad morning breath was inevitable, but this supplement proved me wrong.

It‚Äôs been a few months now, and I can confidently say this has been one of the best decisions for my health. My teeth feel stronger, my gums are healthier, and my mouth feels fresh all day.

What makes this supplement so unique is its scientific foundation‚Äîit‚Äôs not just another mouth-freshening gimmick. ProDentim works based on real science, focusing on the microbiome in the mouth, a concept we often associate with gut health but rarely with dental care. Most of us know probiotics benefit our digestion, but ProDentim takes this understanding further by applying it to our mouths.

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: our mouths are home to billions of bacteria, both good and bad. Traditional dental products often aim to eliminate bacteria entirely, but ProDentim‚Äôs approach is to support the beneficial bacteria already present. This is crucial because when the mouth‚Äôs microbiome is balanced with a healthy colony of ‚Äúgood‚Äù bacteria, there‚Äôs less room for harmful bacteria to thrive. By prioritizing this balance, ProDentim helps the body create a more stable environment that protects teeth and gums naturally.

ProDentim combines several strains of probiotics known for their health benefits. The specific strains are carefully selected to target dental issues directly. For instance, one of the probiotics included is Lactobacillus Paracasei, which is scientifically proven to support gum health. This strain specifically helps reduce inflammation, making it perfect for individuals like me who had chronic gum soreness.

Then, there‚Äôs BLIS K-12, another powerful addition. BLIS K-12 has been studied for its ability to reduce the number of harmful bacteria in the mouth, which in turn reduces plaque formation and improves overall oral health. What‚Äôs particularly notable is that BLIS K-12 has been shown to improve the freshness of breath, not just temporarily but in a lasting way, as it prevents odor-causing bacteria from accumulating.

And let‚Äôs talk about one more standout ingredient‚ÄîInulin. This prebiotic works as fuel for beneficial bacteria, helping them thrive and multiply. Inulin supports a natural ecosystem in the mouth by feeding the good bacteria, which can crowd out the bad ones. Together, these ingredients form a powerful combination that supports gum health, reduces plaque, and gives the mouth a level of freshness that lasts.

Over time, this approach creates what feels like a stronger, more resilient mouth. Since starting ProDentim, I‚Äôve noticed that even when I‚Äôve skipped a brushing here or there (hey, life gets busy!), my teeth and gums have stayed strong and healthy.

**1. How long does it take to see results?**  
Based on my experience, I started noticing subtle changes within the first week, like fresher breath and a cleaner feeling in my mouth. But for significant improvements, like healthier gums and reduced sensitivity, it took about a month. Remember, consistency is key here, as it‚Äôs designed to gradually build a healthier oral environment.

**2. Are there any side effects?**  
I didn‚Äôt experience any side effects, but everyone‚Äôs body responds differently. Since ProDentim relies on probiotics and natural ingredients, it‚Äôs generally well-tolerated. However, if you‚Äôre concerned, especially if you have specific allergies, it‚Äôs a good idea to consult with a dentist or healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.

**3. How does ProDentim taste?**  
One thing I liked right away was the taste. It‚Äôs pleasant and slightly minty, so it feels like a little boost of freshness every time I chew it. Unlike some supplements that feel like a chore to take, I actually enjoyed adding this to my routine.

**4. Do I need to change my brushing or flossing habits?**  
No major changes are required. I continued my usual brushing and flossing routine, but with ProDentim, I felt like my mouth stayed fresher longer. It‚Äôs meant to work alongside your regular oral hygiene, not replace it. For me, it amplified the effects of my brushing and flossing rather than substituting for them.

**5. Can it help with gum sensitivity and bleeding?**  
This was a big one for me, as I‚Äôd struggled with sore, sensitive gums. By around the second week, I noticed less gum irritation and reduced bleeding when flossing. The probiotic strains in ProDentim target inflammation, which, in my experience, helped ease my gum issues noticeably.

**6. Is ProDentim safe for daily use?**  
Yes, it‚Äôs designed for daily use, and I‚Äôve found it easy to incorporate into my routine. I took one tablet each morning, just like taking a vitamin. Regular use has been essential in seeing long-lasting benefits, so I‚Äôd recommend making it a daily habit.

**7. Can it replace toothpaste or mouthwash?**  
No, ProDentim is a supplement, not a replacement for brushing or using mouthwash. It enhances oral health from within, targeting areas that brushing alone can‚Äôt reach. Think of it as a way to support and amplify your daily hygiene practices rather than a replacement.

**8. Is it suitable for people with braces or other dental work?**  
From what I‚Äôve read and experienced, ProDentim is safe for people with dental work, as it doesn‚Äôt interfere with braces, crowns, or fillings. But, of course, checking with your dentist if you have specific dental needs is always wise.

that being said, ive been considering other career paths with seemingly better career stability/prospects and values more aligned with mine and ive been considering healthcare, specifically nursing. it would be challenging to study for sure especially since its been awhile since i took advanced stem classes, but i can envision myself working in this field long term and dont mind continuing health education as it does interest me. i like the diverse specialties, possibility of flexibility with travel nursing and 3 12s and more. having direct impact on humans and working on my feet/with my hands quickly also has been stimulating to me. even my parents are also supportive of me going back to school for this, so im strongly leaning towards starting this new journey this coming year by fulfilling pre nursing reqs first.

i dont think theres ever a ""perfect"" job and i dont think ill ever be fully satisfied, but with who i am as a person now and what i want my future to look like, for sum reason going into healthcare piques my interest.

1gq1lht,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gq1lht,"Estranged Mother contacts me on my birthday (CW drugs, abuse)","IM SORRY THIS IS SO LONG!!!
I will give some context, and then I will give my response that I will be texting tomorrow (I will take constructive criticism that I deem has good intention.)

I turned 18 today. (yippee adulthood) I have had basically a restraining order against my mother since I was taken by CPS. The reason I was taken was the amount of parties that she would throw with me there. They would involve drugs, alcohol, and physical abuse from the boyfriends she was cheating on my dad with. Then she abandoned me. I saw her on and off for a couple years after that until I was about five and my dad claimed legal guardianship of me. Because of all of this stuff that has happened, I have developed PTSD, and a dissociative disorder is on the way to being diagnosed.(too long and complicated to explain, and Google is free) Over the years, she has tried to break this restraining order. It got to the point where I wasn't allowed to walk around town because my dad feared that I would run into her and something bad would happen. 

Come present day, I'm out with some friends, and I get a text from my dad. He offered to get me coffee. I agree and soon he comes to pick me up. While in the car with him, he explains that my mother came to our apartment with gifts and flowers. We get home, and I go to look at the note attached to the gift, and I see the note in the picture that I have attached to this post. I have also attached an image of the bouquet for anyone curious. 

Now for the text that I have crafted up. I will be sending this through my father's phone because I don't want her to have my number. I wrote this when I was really upset and triggered, and that's why I haven't sent it yet. I want to be sure this is what I want to say. 

!! TEXT RESPONSE HERE !!

Hello MOTHERS NAME, this is DEADNAME. Dad told me about the gifts. He showed me your text. He let me have the gifts you gave me. I saw your note with your number on it. I have decided to communicate this way for safety reasons. 

I understand that you love me. I understand that you have breast cancer. I understand that you say you need me, and that you don't know how to love. But it seems you did not take into consideration my feelings, and I have a lot of them.

I find it selfish that your first message to me since I've turned 18 was about you and your feelings. I find it childish that you chose to contact me on my birthday; bringing up these hard feelings, and guilt tripping my father, trying to get him to open the door for you. Not to mention that you haven't even proved that you are able to get sober enough to talk to me while I was still a minor. I am angry. I am hurt. 

I know you talked to your mother. I know she apologized and promised to get better. My guess is that you will try to do the same. You know what happened when your mother came back, though. I don't want promises. I want action. I wanted a mother to come to my soccer games. I wanted a mother who would comfort me when I came home crying from being bullied at school. I wanted a mother who actually stayed when she said she would. I wanted a mother who was there. You have not done that for me

You asked for a chance to explain yourself, and yet you never even apologized for what happened to me because of you. I want an apology. A full length apology. A proper apology. Not an, ""oh my sweet baby I'm so sorry!"" I want to know you see me as human. I want to know that you understand what happened. 

I will not be responding to any text other than an apology at this time. I would appreciate if you did not show up at the apartments unannounced again. 
I wish you the best,

My immediate thought was ‚Äúoh no‚Äù‚Ä¶ my pelvic area was hurting and still nothing else was coming out. I went back to bed and laid there in discomfort/pain still, and went back to the bathroom another 2 times where I‚Äôd sit for 10 minutes and literal drops came out. 

In the morning, I finally could pee but I would have a slight pain after I was done (not stinging, just an odd pain down there). Throughout the day, the pain lessened and lessened. Now today (day 2) I‚Äôm at work and don‚Äôt feel anything I don‚Äôt think. I‚Äôve been drinking water (not a lot but usually I have coffee so of course I couldn‚Äôt have that today and have been having water, which is better anyway). 

I don‚Äôt have insurance anymore and my local urgent care quoted me $225 for a visit for UTI urine sample and a prescription. Doesn‚Äôt cover cost of the medicine prescribed. 

Should I still see a doctor??? I know there is slight risks for untreated UTIs.. 

This isn‚Äôt my first time and I‚Äôm confused about why this one is so much less extreme than the last. My first UTI  was about 1-2 years ago, and symptoms lasted for days and it was very bad stinging  pain every time I used the bathroom. I was on the medicine that turns your pee orange I believe. 

One thing about me and what I believe to be the reason for both UTI‚Äôs, since I was a little girl I‚Äôve had a terrible habit of holding my pee until I‚Äôm ‚Äúdancing‚Äù or bouncing my legs. Family and friends and even my boss have always told me ‚Äúgo pee!‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure why I do this, just something in my brain tells me I need to finish what I‚Äôm doing first/it can wait.

A random but possibly relevant detail? I‚Äôve been saying for a long time now that I think I have a small bladder. I don‚Äôt know when this happened but I noticed that I have to pee so much more frequently than others. I feel ashamed by it and especially at work I feel it makes me look bad because I cannot have a few sips of water without having to go. And if I don‚Äôt drink water I get migraines ü´† 

Another possibly relevant detail: I‚Äôve been drinking alcohol just about every day this past week, if that matters at all, 2-3 drinks a day. Usually I only drink 3-4 days (not any better I know).

Another bitingly cold morning in Northern Michigan. A young woman opened the bakery she worked at after spending the last four hours baking to sell her product.

It was in a small, quaint rural town and not many people came in for cupcakes, cookies, and doughnuts. It was mostly hunters and loggers looking for a hot cup of coffee.

One morning, a handsome white haired male came in. She usually knew everyone that came through that door, but not him.",2,1731460802.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

- **DOGE T-Shirt**: Featuring the slogan ""Cutting Through Red Tape Since 2024"". Wear it to show you mean business, or at least that you're trying to.

- **Efficiency Flowchart Mouse Pad**: Helps visualize how much more efficient you could be if you weren't stuck behind a computer all day.

- **DOGE Action Figure**: Comes with accessories like a calculator for budget cuts, a small eraser labeled ""Waste"", and a tiny magnifying glass for finding inefficiencies. Pose it on your desk to remind everyone you're here to make a difference.

- **The ""I Survived the Audit"" Bumper Sticker**: For those who've lived through the grueling process of proving their department isn't just a black hole of tax dollars.

Remember, in the quest for government efficiency, the journey is just as important as the destination. Or at least, that's what they'll print on the back of the merch. ",1,1731460538.0,Trumpisfreedom,0,1.0,False

For some background information, the friend (23f) who went along with us was one of his college friends, and all three of us had hung out multiple times before this happened. But while in the planning stage, she explained that she wanted some company since her boyfriend (23m) didn‚Äôt want to be stuck in a small car with her for that long. It would be a trip from one coast to the other for school. Before things were set in stone, I let them know that I would be out of my comfort zone since it would be my first time doing a road trip without family (childish, I know), and to me, it seemed like they understood. Each person had their set section of an itinerary (I did the first section). The first few days of the trip went well. The middle of it, however, was shaky. On the third day, we stopped by a cafe in the morning for some coffee and breakfast. My ex-friend and I were having a good conversation while eating. Then, when we had split off to the bathroom (she and I went together while my ex waited in the car), my friend's ex had made it back to the car before I did, and when I was walking out, I could see they were talking. When I got to the car, it was silent. When I would try to ask a question or initiate a conversation, it would just be a cold response from either one of them. Now fast forward to nighttime. After being pretty much ignored the whole day, they went out for drinks, and I stayed in the motel room because I was tired and didn‚Äôt mind watching the bags again. I was so frustrated with how things had gone that day that I made the rash choice of calling and breaking up with him. I told him, ‚ÄúYou no longer have a partner if you‚Äôre going to treat me like this when you‚Äôre with friends. Now repeat it back to me.‚Äù And he did. Now I get that I was harsh with how I did it, but when he and his friend came back, he made his friend wait in the hallway and told me that he thinks we should break up and that he isn‚Äôt going to change his mind because he ‚Äòknew‚Äô how he felt about breakups and was going to stand his ground. (Which has honestly never happened before about him standing his ground) but I cried, said ok, and we all went to bed. When I woke up, he first said to me, ‚ÄúDo you have the means to get home?‚Äù I started crying again because I was under the impression that we would all continue this trip together. Long story short, he ditched me at an airport in a random state where I didn‚Äôt know anybody. The car ride up there was just crickets (knowing that I had never flown before, nor did I know how to navigate an airport, which is crazy). I had to call my sister for help, and she ensured I returned home safely. That night, I had gotten texts from both the friend and him asking if I had gotten home safely. In response, I just ignored them because I was under the impression that if you love someone, you won‚Äôt treat them like that. But a week later, he returned for his car (after I had moved my things out of the apartment we lived in together for two years back to my mom's). He didn‚Äôt say a word or look me in the eyes. He only spoke to my dog(whom we adopted together and a cute cat I let him keep), grabbed his keys, and left. That was four months ago. His birthday was a few months after the breakup, and I wished him a happy birthday. However, when my birthday came up, it was crickets.

I've got almost no furniture, so really looking at a blank slate. I'd love some ideas on how to best layout this living/dining space.  
Here's some ideas and thoughts of my own:

  
Goals:

* no TV upstairs
* Lean into the mid century (its a little greige‚Äôd out right now)
* Lighting needs some serious work but need to figure out the furniture first

Remove:

* Delete the high top kitchen table
* L couch to the basement

Add:

* move in the Amish-made low six seat table my parents are giving me
* where current couch is, replace with some sort of low back love seat thing with double arms
* MCM wood sitting chair facing away from dining table
* Side table between chair and couch
* Small wood coffee table like a blob shape
* Glass fireplace door with brass trim
* Lamps for days

Thanks in advance for your input!

1gq0xh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandSew/comments/1gq0xh3/book_review_alabama_chanin_series/,Book Review: Alabama Chanin Series,"Awhile back I saw some requests for handsewing books. Sadly there are not many. But a series I've been using a lot lately is the Alabama Chanin [books](https://alabamachanin.com/collections/studio-books). These were written by Natalie Chanin, a designer known for her handsewn fashion lines. I was able to acquire and read all but one (there are six in total), including the original two which are now out of print, from the library. I ended up buying one because I use it so much. 

Overall I think these books are pretty good for teaching the following skills

* Handsewn garment construction (what I'm most interested in)
* Embellishments/applique, etc. on cotton jersey fabric, which is very interesting because in the past I've been told that you should avoid this on stretch fabrics like cotton jersey. This inspired me to experiment more with stuff you ""shouldn't"" do on stretch fabrics like sashiko.

Each book focuses on different things:

**Alabama Stitch Book (2008)**: the first book, which I think is still worth reading because of the upcycling instructions for turning old tees into nice things like her famous ""corset tee"". Later books she uses cotton jersey fabric. It comes with a pattern that I used to upcycle a couple of old garments into some shirts I wear a lot.

**Alabama Studio Style: More Projects, Recipes & Stories Celebrating Sustainable Fashion & Living (2010**): My copy was missing all the patterns and stencils. Overall pretty redundant except a few more embellishment techniques.

**Alabama Studio Sewing + Design (2012):** My library didn't have this, I requested it on interlibrary loan and haven't gotten it yet.

**Alabama Studio Sewing Patterns (2015):** Definitely the most useful for me. All the patterns from the original books, plus detailed section on adjusting patterns. Tells you what stitches to use for different parts of each pattern. Patterns are on CD-ROM and who has a CD-ROM reader? I didn't and had to borrow one from a friend.

**The geometry of hand-sewing : a romance in stitches and embroidery from Alabama Chanin and the School of Making (2017):** The one I bought because it has these stitch stencil guides I do find helpful. It really is just a stitch dictionary, but it's a good one. 

**Embroidery, threads and stories : from Alabama Chanin and the School of Making (2022)**: this is just a coffee table art book and I didn't really get much out of it. 

For me the most useful things I learned were more ""stretch"" stitches (like the lovely chained feather) and improving my execution of those I already knew (cretan, herringbone)

  
I hesitate to review the patterns because well, I don't follow instructions, but they were fairly easy to adapt for my own needs. She recommends working with cotton jersey fabric and specific threads, including a ""button craft"" polyester coated cotton thread. I like to work with scraps and like to avoid polyester threads. I think the thick cotton sashiko thread I use worked great though for the [bra](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImprovFiberArts/comments/1glhiwa/i_had_a_dream_about_a_sashiko_bra_so_i_improvd/) I adapted from her corset pattern. I also adapted her corset pattern for leather/waxed thread which[ didn't work as well ](https://www.instagram.com/eldritchsalvage/p/DCScLh1S_0F/)but it's...certainly interesting and I've been enjoying wearing it. And the techniques I learned from the process I'm using to repair some shoes.

Some caveats are the patterns are really not very size inclusive. They are generally designed for smaller than average people with boobs (so generally women). And I have heard bad things about how Natalie Chanin treats workers (see her company's Glassdoor reviews). The style of clothing is definitely kind of boho/lagenlook which isn't for everyone. They kind of remind me of clothes that a  middle aged women who works at an art college would wear.

I also feel annoyed about the patterns for the pattern book being on CD-rom... if you try to get them from her website they cost $22 for just the PDF of ONE PATTERN! And $28 for printed! It was very much worth it for me to track down a CD-ROM reader. I printed one at the library and taped it together and might try [https://pdfplotting.com/](https://pdfplotting.com/) for the rest.

1gq0tvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gq0tvn/i_ended_my_true_crime_podcast_after_meeting_my/,I ended my true crime podcast after meeting my biggest fan. ,"I ran a successful true-crime podcast called *Eidolon.* It covered missing-person cases, from legendary stories on Amelia Earhart to relatively unknown cases from the recent news. Recently, I told my 100K plus followers that I was stepping away to focus on other projects, namely my day job as an audio engineer. I told my friends that I was taking a mental health break. All the interviews with grieving parents, friends, and lovers with no closure had chipped away at my soul. I needed to reset, rediscover the beauty in this world, to forget the darkness that lurks beneath its surface. ¬†

But the main reason I shuttered *Eidolon*, the reason I deleted all my audio files and contact sheets, the reason I promised myself I would never touch the true-crime genre again was due to one person: **CharnelSam.** According to his scant Patreon profile, Sam was located somewhere in the U.S. and had plenty of discretionary income, donating to various true-crime podcasts via the site. But he gave the most money to mine, having donated over $5,000 to *Eidolon* for the past two years, usually through regular $200 payments. CharnelSam was my biggest fan.¬†

My online conversations with Sam were brief and professional. I sent him a nice, personalized ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù message each time he donated and would announce his username at the top of my credits after each episode. Most of the time, my messages went unanswered. But on occasion, he would respond with a single cryptic sentence. It was always the same:¬†

***‚ÄúLight floods the grateful frame, catching moments gifted by time.‚Äù***

I had no idea what that meant or what it had to do with my podcast. It might have been part of his online signature, perhaps some famous quote missing an attribution. But if that were the case, why only send the attribution and not an actual message? I never thought much about it. I was just happy to receive such large and consistent donations. If Charnel Sam wanted to send me a cryptic quote now and then, he was more than welcome to do it. But everything changed a few weeks ago when I received this:

***Hey Brian. I have some information that I think could help solve the Bertrand Hikers Mystery.***¬†

I‚Äôd recently re-aired an episode on the Bertrand Hikers, two teenage girls who mysteriously vanished while hiking in the Bertrand Nature Preserve in northwestern Georgia, an area not far from my home in the Atlanta suburbs. The case was one of my most popular stories and the main one that launched my podcast. The disappearance of Heather Simmons and Alisha Gundersen is one of those local legends that everyone I grew up with knew about but never received much national attention. As such, it was a relatively unknown missing-person case when I recorded my first podcast episode on it. Though the girls were teenagers, they were not the attractive, white, blonde teens that received most of the media‚Äôs attention. Heather was slightly overweight for her age, with lots of bushy curly hair. The popular girls at her school picked on her, calling her Shamu. Alisha was pretty but still an outsider in the small town of Bertrand. She was biracial with a white Norwegian father and a Nigerian mother. Her family had recently moved to America from Bergen, Norway, and she spoke broken English. There were kids at school who jokingly referred to her as a dark elf.¬†

Both girls were 16 at the time of their disappearance. They became friends at Bertrand High, where they shared a homeroom. They played soccer and loved bands like Nirvana and The Smashing Pumpkins. They stayed up late watching John Carpenter movies and binging on popcorn and Kit Kats. They got straight A‚Äôs in all their classes. They dressed up as Beetlejuice and Catwoman for Halloween one year. They were inseparable. Alisha was planning to go to Harvard Med and become a dentist when she grew up, and Heather wanted to be a wildlife photographer for National Geographic. More on that later. They weren‚Äôt popular at school, but they had loving families, and they always had each other.¬†

On October 17th, 1998, Heather and Alisha biked from their homes to the Bertrand Nature Preserve, a massive park covering  80 square miles of dense forest that blanketed the low-lying mountains of the Appalachian Foothills. Witnesses at the visitor center saw them arrive around noon that Saturday. They‚Äôd told their parents they were just going for a short hike up to Bald Head Rock, a scenic lookout about three miles from the parking lot where they‚Äôd chained up their bikes. Tons of people hiked the trail on the weekends, and the girls were planning to be home well before nightfall. In fact, Heather and Alisha were planning to see the movie *Practical Magic* with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman later that night at 8:00 pm.¬†

But 8:00 pm came and went, and the girls‚Äô bikes remained untouched in the parking lot. No one had seen them. No one had heard from them. By then, Heather and Alisha‚Äôs parents were frantic. They‚Äôd already called 911, and a couple of officers had gone out to the Bertrand Nature Preserve to search for the missing teens. All they found were the bikes, still chained up outside the nature center. ¬†

Over the following weeks, a huge search party combed the mountains. Hundreds of volunteers and SAR personnel checked behind every tree, looked within every bush, and turned over every rock, searching for clues. They found nothing! 

Eventually, the news reports stopped. The missing posters on telephone polls and outside shops started to fade, fall off, or were even pasted over with fliers advertising local bands or politicians running for upcoming elections. As sad as it was, the case would‚Äôve disappeared into total obscurity were it not for a strange discovery almost two years later. 

In 2000, a local Boy Scout troop was camping in the Bertrand Preserve when one of the kids stumbled upon a rusted single-lens reflex (SLR) camera half-buried in the dirt near their campsite. He didn‚Äôt know it then, but the boy had just discovered Heather‚Äôs most prized possession. She‚Äôd taken the camera with her on that fateful day in October two years prior. 

When the authorities developed the camera‚Äôs film roll, they uncovered a breakdown of that day‚Äôs events. The first half of the pictures are known colloquially as **The** **Day Shots**. These pictures were all timestamped on October 17th, 1998, likely taken over two to three hours while the girls were on their hike. The photos showed squirrels scurrying among the canopy, alien-like mushrooms growing on the moist ground, and various angles of Alisha hiking up to Bald Head Rock. There were shots of Alisha silhouetted against the afternoon sun and others showing her disappearing into an endless forest. Heather had a good eye for composition, and she knew how to make the most of natural lighting. It‚Äôs sad looking at the Day Shots now because you can see the raw talent of a burgeoning artist finding her voice. She would‚Äôve made a great photographer had she come home that day.¬†

Another thing people noticed was the way Heather captured Alisha‚Äôs beauty in the photos, the way she brought out her best friend‚Äôs hazel-green eyes, and accentuated her sharp facial bone structure using a juxtaposition of light and shadow. There was already speculation among their classmates that Heather had a crush on Alisha. Some even believed they were a couple, though Alisha had many boyfriends in high school, and there was no evidence the two girls had ever hooked up. Some speculated that Heather may have killed Alisha after she‚Äôd rejected Heather‚Äôs advances, and then Heather killed herself. But there was no evidence of this from eyewitnesses or the photos themselves. ¬†

What was clear from The Day Shots was that both girls had a zest for life. They were having fun and goofing off. There were even some forced-perspective photos of Heather and Alisha pretending to eat a downed tree. These pictures contradicted one of the authorities‚Äô early theories regarding the girls‚Äô disappearance: that they might have taken their own lives due to depression. It was a reasonable theory, given that both girls were bullied at school and had no real friends outside of each other. But they never left a note, and neither their parents nor their classmates felt they were depressed.¬†

What really got the authority's attention was a second set of photos on the roll. They called them--  

**The Night Shots.**¬†

These photos were timestamped on October 31st, 1998, a full two weeks after the girls were reported missing. They were taken in the middle of the night with a camera flash for 30 minutes. Creepiest of all was the subject matter. The Night Shots were almost entirely random images of the forest: tree limbs, bushes, rocks. There were no signs of civilization in them, just endless darkness beyond the foliage caught in the camera flash. Many of the pictures were out of focus, showing random green and black blurs. The most famous photo was a close-up of what appeared to be the back of Heather‚Äôs head. Her curly hair filled the frame. Amongst those bushy strands was a dark red streak: BLOOD.¬†

The photos on Heather‚Äôs camera were never officially released to the public. They remained sealed in evidence until sometime in the late 2000s, possibly ‚Äô08 or ‚Äô09. That‚Äôs when someone leaked them to a now-defunct true crime forum called Missing Inc, and they eventually found their way to Reddit. Once people saw the photos online, the Bertrand Hikers case took on a whole new dimension. Suddenly, there were dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of posts discussing the case and providing theories behind the girls' disappearance. All of them were centered around The Night Shots.

There was a popular theory that the girls had gone off the trail and became lost, and The Night Shots were a way of signaling rescuers with the camera flash. There was a massive search of the Bertand Nature Preserve on Halloween 1998. The SAR personnel were likely close to the girls at that time.¬†

Another popular theory posited that the girls became incapacitated. Perhaps they had got lost and then fallen off the trail in the dark. Both girls were too injured to hike out. Many believed Heather had died from her fall, and Alisha used the camera to see her friend and get a bearing on where they had landed. 

Some armchair sleuths even believed Alisha had killed Heather, given the close-up of Heather‚Äôs bloodied scalp, though there was no clear motive for such a crime. Jealousy? A verbal fight that had escalated into something physical? Perhaps Alisha pushed Heather, causing her only friend to accidentally fall to her death. Alisha, overcome with guilt and worried that she would be arrested for murder, then took her own life, but not before providing a confession in the form of random photos.¬†

I didn‚Äôt believe any such theories.¬†

***Hi Sam. Thanks again for all your support. I‚Äôd love to see what info you have on Bertrand.***¬†

An hour later, he sent this reply.¬†

***Would you mind meeting up at Coffee Land on the corner of Weston and Whitsett?***¬†

This caught me off guard. When I received Sam‚Äôs message, I was staying at a hotel in Atlanta for a true crime convention. I was there to run a panel on missing persons cases. A quick Google search revealed that Coffee Land was not far from my hotel. Sam‚Äôs reply came moments after‚Ä¶

***I know you‚Äôre in town for True Crime Con.***¬†

*‚Äî*

‚ÄúBrian?‚Äù A tall, elderly man stood up from his table at the coffee shop. He was balding with silvery hair and a trimmed beard. He wore a nice sweater vest, khaki pants, and horn-rimmed glasses. The man reminded me of a college professor.¬†

‚ÄúUh, yes,‚Äù I said, shaking his offered hand. It was soft and smooth like he used a lot of moisturizers.¬†

‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Samuel,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPlease. Have a seat. Can I get you anything?‚Äù¬†

We both got coffees and returned to our table. The tiny shop was busy with locals coming and going. Students and amateur screenwriters sat at the nearby tables, their heads buried in their laptops.

‚ÄúI must say, I really loved your take on the Bertrand Hikers Mystery,‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only one that I think is close to the truth.‚Äù ¬†

""Thanks,"" I said. My podcast presented a different take from all the others that covered Heather and Alisha's disappearance‚Ä¶ I concluded that someone had kidnapped and likely murdered the girls, and The Night Shots were taken by this suspect. But the evidence I presented was not in The Night Shots themselves. Rather, it was in The Day Shots, the ones most people just glossed over. A good friend of mine is a professional photographer. I had asked her to examine the leaked photos, hoping she might shed some light (both figuratively and literally) on The Night Shots. I wanted her to brighten the pictures without losing too much information and reveal something (or someone) lurking in the darkness just beyond the camera flash. She did just that, but all it revealed was more empty forest.¬†

‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt anything more to see,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe Night Shots have been poured over hundreds of times online anyway.‚Äù My friend paused for a moment. ‚ÄúBut I did take a second look at the daytime photos, and there was something strange on 205.‚Äù¬†

Photo 205, named because of its timestamp of 2:05 pm, was a shot of Alisha and Heather smiling for the camera as they stopped at a lookout point on the way to Bald Head Rock. The camera was likely placed on a rock so it could capture both girls. They appeared happy and carefree in the sunny proto-selfie. The picture captured just how much wilderness was in the Bertrand Nature Preserve. You can see a massive forest stretching for miles and miles behind them.¬†

‚ÄúTake a look at the bottom far right,‚Äù my friend said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lightened the shadows in the background.‚Äù

I stared at the location, but all I found were trees. ‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to see?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right there. Between those two trunks.‚Äù She pointed to a black dot in the far corner. It looked like an oddly shaped stump.¬†

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a person,‚Äù she said. My friend showed me another copy of the photo, this one even brighter. The extra exposure had washed out the girls and the foreground completely. But now I could clearly see the human shape standing in the trees below them, watching. The figure was out of focus, so we couldn‚Äôt make out any details, but it appeared to be a man wearing all black.¬†

‚ÄúOh my God!‚Äù I gasped.¬†

We sent the enhanced photos to the authorities, who thanked us for the new evidence. It was the first break they‚Äôd had in the case in over a decade. The discovery made local headlines. Heather and Alisha‚Äôs families even sent us thank-you cards. But ultimately, it didn‚Äôt lead to much. Without any bodies, there was no evidence the girls were kidnapped, and the lurking figure in Photo 205 was too grainy to identify. All the forensic analysts could conclude was the suspect‚Äôs gender (male) and a rough estimate of his height (6‚Äô3‚Äù). Still, the discovery made my podcast go viral. It was a nice prize after spending months researching the case.¬†

‚ÄúSo you think my theory is the closest, huh?"" I asked Sam. ""That someone kidnapped and likely murdered them?‚Äù¬†

Sam sipped his coffee. It was getting late, and the shop was starting to clear out. ‚ÄúMore than that. I think I can prove it.‚Äù¬†

My eyebrows raised. *This better not be another conspiracy theory*. I‚Äôd run across plenty of weirdos in my true crime career, people who believed that missing persons were abducted by aliens or murdered by Bigfoot. Their stories always started semi-sane, but the more they spoke, the stranger things got until you found yourself listening to how one of the 9/11 hijackers was an interdimensional being who traveled from an alternate Earth to stop the Lizard People‚Äôs Invasion of Washington. ‚ÄúWhat proof?‚Äù I asked.¬†

Sam sat back in his chair and let out a deep breath. ‚ÄúMy brother passed away a month ago,‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúHe was‚Ä¶ Well, he was a handful. Two failed marriages. No kids. No friends. Never got along with anyone in the family except me. He was a drunk and a compulsive gambler. Fucked over almost everyone in his life. My brother was a hoarder, too. Spent most of his life roaming the country, working odd jobs in construction, and living out of a beat-up RV. When he died, I was stuck with the unenviable task of clearing out all the junk he‚Äôd accumulated in his 65 years on this Earth. The stench when I opened that RV door made my eyes water. There was so much rotting garbage. Mountains of crap! I found three rat corpses. Three! I don‚Äôt know how my brother had stuffed everything into such a small space.‚Äù ¬†

Sam set his drink down. ‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôm throwing out boxes of his stuff when I come across these old photos. And there‚Äôs one on top that immediately caught my eye. You know what it was?‚Äù

I shook my head.¬†

Sam reached into his pocket and pulled out a glossy printed photo, the kind you would pick up from a CVS or Walgreens back in the day. It was semi-wrinkled and smudged with grease. As soon as I saw the image, I choked on my Mexican latte‚Ä¶

The photo showed Heather and Alisha. And not just any photo. It was a picture taken on the same day they disappeared. On the same trail up to Bald Head Rock. But this was a new photo, not part of The Day Shots that I'd poured over so many times. In the picture, Heather had her SLR camera slung over her shoulder. As soon as I saw that, I knew the photo wasn‚Äôt from her camera. ‚ÄúWho took this?‚Äù

Sam grinned. ‚ÄúMy brother.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAre there others?‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt show you here.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Sam sat back in his chair, studying me with pensive eyes. ‚ÄúI need an assurance from you first.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou want money, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù I‚Äôd had armchair ‚Äúinvestigators‚Äù ask for payment in exchange for evidence or interviews in the past. I always turned them down. It just felt icky. Distasteful.¬†

‚ÄúWhy would I ask for that?‚Äù Sam looked hurt by my question. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve given you thousands of dollars.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSorry. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had bad experiences,‚Äù I said, hoping I hadn‚Äôt ruined the deal. ""I meant no offense. And I‚Äôm very, very grateful for all your donations. I really am.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt do this for the money, do you?‚Äù Sam asked.¬†

‚ÄúNo. Of course not,‚Äù I said, though even at that moment, I was reminded of how often I'd hoped I could turn this side hustle into a full-time gig. Running a podcast was a lot of work and money, especially one that involved such heavy research, not to mention all the logistics involved with interviewing witnesses and loved ones. ‚ÄúI want to bring closure,"" I said. I‚Äôd always felt that the only thing worse than losing a loved one in a violent crime was having that person go missing instead. At least a murder gave you a definite answer. A missing person was like a never-ending haunting, a spirit taunting you with the possibility, however faint, of a miraculous return. 

‚ÄúYou want the truth,‚Äù Sam said.¬†

""Don‚Äôt we all?‚Äù¬†

Sam finished his coffee, then got up to throw it away. ‚ÄúI live not far from here,‚Äù he said.

**‚Äî**¬†

Sam's house was a modest, one-story ranch-style bungalow. I immediately noticed an old RV in its driveway as I parked out front. I stared at the rundown vehicle as I walked toward the home's entrance.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking to sell that thing once I‚Äôve finished cleaning it out.‚Äù Sam was waiting on the front porch to let me in.¬†

As soon as I did, I noticed that Sam had brought much of his brother‚Äôs RV hoard inside. I had to squeeze past stacks of crumpled magazines and cardboard boxes of random junk in the living room.¬†

‚ÄúSorry about all this,‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúOnce I discovered the photos, I decided I needed to do a more thorough investigation of my brother‚Äôs belongings before throwing them all out.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I said. The house was dark and musty. A heaviness lingered in the air. It felt like walking underwater.¬†

Sam led me to a kitchen table, the one pristine spot in the house. There, he pulled out a dusty photo album. It was big and black with a leather exterior. ‚ÄúI found the rest of his photos in here.‚Äù The album creaked as he opened it. 

Inside were pictures of roadside attractions, long stretches of highway, national parks, and random people. It looked like the photo journal of a relentless traveler. There were pictures of temperate rainforests in the Pacific Northwest, desert canyons, big cities, rest stops, and lots and lots of forests. Sam stopped as he reached a section with photos of the Appalachian Mountains. ‚ÄúThis is where it begins.‚Äù¬†

The first page showed pictures of the Bertrand Nature Center and parking lot. I leaned in. There were the girls‚Äô bikes tied up outside.¬†

Flip. Creak. 

Pictures of the main hiking trail. Trees. Mountain vistas.¬†

Flip. Creak. 

There was the photo of Heather and Alisha, the same one Sam had shown me at Coffee Land. Alongside it were other photos of the girls: some of them smiling for the camera, others where they struck semi-serious poses like they were fashion models. They appeared to be having a great time.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù I said, staring. ‚ÄúHe took all of these?‚Äù

‚ÄúApparently, he‚Äôd struck up a friendship with the girls,‚Äù Sam said. The old man was about to turn the page when he stopped.¬†

I instinctively reached out to turn it myself, but Sam kept the pages closed. ‚ÄúSorry. I need one more assurance from you before I continue.""

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù I stepped back, suddenly aware of how close I‚Äôd gotten to the old man.¬†

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm about to show you is very sensitive. It could do irreparable damage to my family if it ever got out,‚Äù Sam said, staring into my eyes. I‚Äôd never noticed how dark his eyes were. They were a deep brown, almost black, in the low light of his house. ‚ÄúI need you to promise me you‚Äôll keep this a secret. You cannot tell anyone. Not the cops. Not even the victims‚Äô families. No one.‚Äù

*""What?""* A million little alarm bells rang out in my head. There's something wrong here. Very wrong. ‚ÄúI- I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I kept backing away from the old man. ‚ÄúI need to‚Äî‚Äú and accidentally stumbled into a tower of magazines, falling onto the dusty floor.¬†

Sam shot up from the table. *How can he move that fast?* Within seconds, the old man was looming over me, offering his hand to help me up. His spindly fingers danced in the air like spider legs.

I crawled away from him but immediately bumped into the wall.

Sam had me trapped in a corner. He grinned, flashing long yellow teeth. ‚ÄúYou want to know the truth, don‚Äôt you, Brian? The mystery nags at your soul. You've been so good to me, filling this world with intriguing and tasty mysteries. I wanted to give you a little treat in return.‚Äù He kept his hand out.  ¬†

I still didn‚Äôt take it. Instead, my hand shot to my iPhone.¬†

‚ÄúDo you really want to call the police?‚Äù Sam asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think your parents at 2165 Sycamore Park Circle would much appreciate that.‚Äù¬† ¬† ¬†

‚ÄúHow did you...?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know all about you, Brian,‚Äù the old man said. ‚ÄúI know the apartment where you live. I know the last girl you dated. I know how late you stay up editing your podcast every Thursday.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a brother, do you?‚Äù I slowly got to my feet, iPhone still in my hand, finger hovering over the Emergency Call button.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt you,‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúI brought you here as a friend. Besides, you‚Äôre not even my taste.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your friend,‚Äù I said, but my voice was low and weak, barely above a whisper. I wanted to shout. To scream. I wanted to deck the old man with a sucker punch. But all I could do was stand there, stiff as a corpse‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt tell anyone,‚Äù I said, putting the iPhone back in my pocket. ‚ÄúI swear.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúVery good, Brian. Very good.‚Äù Sam offered for me to take a seat at his kitchen table, but I stood right where I was, with a clear shot to the front door in case he tried anything.¬†

""Fine. You can remain there."" 

Sam grabbed the photo album and held it up for me to see its contents. He turned the pages. Creak‚Ä¶ At first, I thought someone had scrawled over the photos with a red marker. But then I realized the crimson was part of the photos; each shot a different angle of the girls lying in a dark forest. They‚Äôd been ripped to shreds, limbs torn off, intestines splayed across the dirt. It was like a pack of wolves had killed them. 

I hunched over, fighting the urge to vomit.¬†

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt see me coming,‚Äù Sam said calmly. ‚ÄúBut they heard me‚Ä¶ out there in the dark, trying to capture my true form on film. I didn‚Äôt like that.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I stepped back, closer to the exit. ¬†

‚ÄúThey say fear spoils the meat,‚Äù Sam said, closing his album of horrors. ‚ÄúBut when you season it like I do, it only gets tastier with time. So long as no one knows what happened. I feed on the mystery as much as I feed on the flesh.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy them? Why Heather and Alisha?‚Äù

Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúThey happened across my path.‚Äù¬†

I felt something wet in my hands. I had balled my fingers into fists so tightly that my nails dug into my palms. Adrenaline coursed through my veins. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sick, you know that. You‚Äôre a sick, perverted old man.‚Äù¬†

Charnel Sam laughed in response. He kept laughing and laughing as if I‚Äôd just told him the funniest joke in the universe. His mouth grew wider with each guffaw, eventually becoming so wide it revealed row upon row of teeth within his dark maw. Each row moved independently, like a separate mouth. Sam‚Äôs laughter turned into an ear-splitting chorus, so loud and discordant it took me a moment to realize what it was‚Ä¶¬†

**Cries of agony from countless victims, Heather and Alisha included.**

I sprinted for the front door, accidentally knocking over a tower of boxes on my way out. Each box contained bones: femurs, ribs, clavicles, skulls. All of them human!¬†

‚Äî

I called the cops as soon as I was back in my car, speeding away from Sam‚Äôs house of horrors. How could I not call them? That creature had to be stopped.¬†

The police descended upon the location within the hour. By then, Sam, his RV, and photo album were gone. But the house was still full of hoarded junk and plenty of bones. A CSI team found the remains of forty victims in Sam‚Äôs demented collection. All of them were from missing-person cases,  cases that had grown icy over the years. I took some consolation in the fact that Heather and Alisha‚Äôs parents were among the first to be notified.¬†

When the FBI brought me in for questioning, I told them everything I‚Äôve just told you. They think Sam is some deranged serial killer, not a supernatural entity. That last part was just a fear-induced hallucination, at least according to my therapist.¬†

There‚Äôs currently a nationwide manhunt for my biggest fan. Charnel Sam is out there somewhere, roaming the highways, looking for his next meal. I‚Äôve gone into hiding, too. Witness Protection. The authorities claim Sam will never find me or my family here, but I don‚Äôt believe them. I broke Sam‚Äôs promise. He‚Äôll never let me forget that.¬†

The only comfort I have now is the fact that if I were to disappear next, the FBI would immediately know who did it. Charnel Sam feeds on the mystery as much as he feeds on the flesh. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve posted this story. To warn the world. Because Sam‚Äôs most likely victim is someone who has never heard of him.

From quirky catchphrases like ‚ÄúHow you doin‚Äô?‚Äù to the unforgettable coffee shop scenes, *Friends* has cemented itself as more than just a sitcom‚Äîit‚Äôs a cultural phenomenon. But why did it have such an impact, and what keeps fans coming back decades later?

After doing a deep dive into the making of *Friends* for a recent video on my channel, Platform+, I uncovered some pretty fascinating stories behind the show. Here are a few teasers:

‚Ä¢ **Did you know the main cast almost looked completely different?** The showrunners had other actors in mind for some roles, but everything changed at the last minute.

‚Ä¢ **The hidden meaning behind certain set pieces** ‚Äì There‚Äôs more to Central Perk than just cozy couches and coffee. Some items on set are actually nods to the character‚Äôs backstories.

‚Ä¢ **Unseen friendships** ‚Äì Many of the actors had special connections and hilarious behind-the-scenes moments that fans would have loved to see.

My video digs into these lesser-known facts, stories of the actors‚Äô close-knit friendships, and the creative choices that helped *Friends* resonate with audiences around the world.

Why do you think *Friends* became such a staple of pop culture? What makes it so re-watchable, even for new generations? Drop your thoughts below, and if you‚Äôre curious about more hidden facts and stories, check out the full breakdown on Platform+!

How long to wait? Also, Q about night time binge eating issues...","Hi everyone. I've been asking my doctor for weight loss help for nearly two years now. I was on long term high dose steroids several years ago and gained almost 30 pounds that I've been unable to lose, and I struggle with impulsive binge eating in the evenings right up til bed. Just can't get a handle on it. 

Finally today he said he can prescribe phentermine (which I'd never heard of until today) but that I have to go off adderall if he does because my family has very serious heart issues and I already am on blood pressure meds for my arrhythmia (low dose bp meds helps to keep it from happening). 

Does anyone here know how long adderall stays in the system? I took my normal dose this morning. Wondering if it's safe to take phen tomorrow morning before work.

Also, doc gave me capsules so I can't break them in half (so can't take half in the morning and half at lunch for better evening appetite reduction). I'm very caffeine sensitive and can't sleep if I have coffee after about 10am so I'm thinking probably I do need to take the phen very early in the day to be able to sleep at night, BUT my binge eating issues are right before bed! Did anyone find that they still got help from a dose schedule like this, with compulsive night time eating? Thanks!",1,1731459371.0,PhentermineTopiramate,3,1.0,False
1gq0mf2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gq0mf2,"My Red Worms, Nightcrawler Worms and Wile Worms compost Bin.","Here's 3 worm compost bins I've started on Oct 24th, 2024. I've started a worm farm before and it was going well. Till they started to die or escape from my bin. That's why with my new set up and knowledge. I've made sure they won't escape and live healthy.
___

Here's a estimate of how many Worms are in each bucket

Nightcrawler Worms = 36
Red Worms = 150
Wild Worms = 50
___

I've also noted how long it takes for them to eat certain fruits. So this is what I only have. 

4 slices of Cucumber = 2 - 3 days
2 slices of apple = will update soon.

I did try potatoes but they didn't seem to like it because it would dry up to quickly.
___

Also if your wondering what I mixed in my soil. Here's a list.

1) 7 - 8 inch deep of soil
2) Shreaded Kraft paper (Same material like cardboard)
3) 1/6 cup of ground coffee.
4) Water

I eye balled the amount of water I used, but I got the soil just moist enough where it's wet but not to wet. If your wondering why I put ground coffee, it acts as a repellent to ants, mosquitos, flys and etc. Last time they planted alot of eggs in my worms bin that I got annoyed it happened. So that's why I put coffee in my soil.
__

Wondering what material I used for 1 compost bin. Here's a list.

1) 2x 5 gallon buckets
2) 2x 5 gallon lids
3) 16 mesh screen
4) Kraft paper.
5) Breatha Rag
___

List of things I used

1) Ground coffee.
2) Water
3) 2x 5 gallon buckets
4) 2x 5 gallon lids
5) 16 mesh screen
6) Kraft paper.
7) Breatha Rag
___

Here are steps to set it up.

1) Get one of the 5 gallon buckets and drill some holes in the bottom of the bucket. Don't make the holes to big or small. Use a 9/64 drill bit.

2) Put the buckets with holes in the bucket without any holes. The second bucket will act as a extra water catcher so your soil doesn't stink or get to moist.

3) Once you made the holes. Get a screen mesh and cut it into a square to fit in the bottom of the bucket. This is so Worms don't try to enter the holes by accident.

4) Cut kraft paper in a square and put it on top of the screen mesh. This also adds another layer to keep Worms aways from the holes.

5) Put soil in the bucket without making the screen mesh and kraft move alot.

6) Add water to the soil and use a ruler to make sure it's 7 - 8 inches deep. If you don't have a ruler. Use your hand make sure use the wet soil cover your hands.

7) Add the ground coffee and mix it well with the dirt. You won't tell from your own eyes, but you will be able to tell by smell when it is fully mixed.

8) Put your Worms in the bin.

9) Cover your Worms with wet kraft paper.

10) Put a wet breatha rag on top of the wet kraft paper.

11) Your done.

Just putting myself out here on a rainy day to see if someone would be open to a good chat. As the title says, I'm open to short or long term depending on how we vibe.

I'm Catherine. Love the outdoors and to travel. Love to hit the gym and keep active. Love coffee. In a love-hate relationship with horror movies since forever. Reading isn't really my thing but I'd listen to a good audio book at times. Not a gamer by a long shot, the last one I played probably was one of the early Counter Strike games. I wholeheartedly appreciate dark humor too!

I'm not great at small talk, but I try my hardest. Just an FYI if you would like to talk. Personality wise, I'd say I'm super easy going, friendly, and easy to talk to. You can ask me more if you'd like to know anything.

I just caught wind of an incredible private deal on the SAMSUNG T9 Portable SSD (1TB) that I absolutely had to share with you all. take a look now before it's gone!

I've been using Samsung SSDs for years, and let me tell you, this T9 is a game-changer. I already own one, but at this price, I'm snagging another without hesitation. It's like having a lightning bolt in your pocket, ready to zap your data transfer woes into oblivion.

Picture this: You're on location for a photoshoot, and your main drive is bursting at the seams. In swoops the T9, a svelte black rectangle that fits snugly in your palm. With transfer speeds up to 2,000MB/s, it's not just fast ‚Äì it's blink-and-you'll-miss-it fast. I've transferred entire photo libraries in the time it takes to grab a coffee.

What really sets the T9 apart is its rugged build. I've accidentally knocked mine off tables (don't judge), and it's shrugged it off like a champ. The peace of mind this gives me when I'm lugging around irreplaceable data is priceless.

The 1TB capacity hits that sweet spot between ample storage and portability. I've stored countless RAW files, 4K videos, and even a few guilty-pleasure Netflix downloads for those long flights. And let's talk about that USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface ‚Äì it's like your data is teleporting rather than transferring.

One aspect I adore is how cool it stays under pressure. During marathon editing sessions, my T9 hasn't broken a sweat. It's like having a zen master handling your data ‚Äì calm, cool, and collected, no matter how frantic you get.

For the creatives out there, this SSD is your new best friend. It's empowered me to work seamlessly between my desktop and laptop, keeping my workflow as fluid as a mountain stream. No more waiting for files to sync or transfer ‚Äì just plug in and go.

So, fellow data enthusiasts, if you value your time and sanity, this deal on the Samsung T9 is a no-brainer. It's not just storage; it's a portal to productivity nirvana. Trust me, your future self will thank you for pouncing on this offer!",1,1731459133.0,SavvyFridays,1,1.0,False

I just moved to the US a couple of months ago and I have some questions about the dating etiquette on Hinge. I‚Äôm from Egypt, which is a conservative country, so dating norms are quite different there compared to the US.

1) How long should you chat on Hinge before asking for a girl‚Äôs number/IG?
2) How long should you chat in general before asking a girl out?
3) Is the first date usually something casual like a coffee date? Or do people usually go on dinner dates here?

Before they had the talismans how did they find food? I'm convinced no one slept at night. Even if they could find a hiding place to get comfortable, who would risk a snore or twitch to reveal their hiding place to the monsters. Did they just forage? Boyd found the animals so they didn't have meat, eggs or dairy.

After trying to bring up my concerns she immediately shut me down and told me to get over it and to just think positively.
