Just a real conversation between two people who maybe should have crossed paths earlier. Open to a quiet coffee or a long walk.

We'll get along if you are... Emotionally honest, not afraid of grey areas or uncomfortable questions. Witty, intuitive, self-aware someone who observes. Loves deep dives into life, art, mind, and meaning. Appreciates solitude, understands nuance, and doesn’t force social energy. Creative, but grounded probably a artist, or someone who should’ve been. Not offended easily, doesn’t moralise casually, and knows how to listen. Values freedom in thought, time, and expression.

I am not looking for a fling or a hook up or anything casual. I am doing this to get out there and do the things I don't usually do. Also please don't be above 35 and below 25. But I can make exceptions to this. And I don't care how you look or where you're from or what you do. All I look for is someone who is comfortable being themselves. I am also open to other plans as long as they don't involve crowds and noise. Please be from Western Suburbs. If this speaks to you, reach out.",1,1754561602.0,mumbaimeetups,0,1.0,False

Now, it might sound strange—okay, really strange—but what if trees have their own way of communicating where they gosisp about the humans, birds, or the weather? Is there anyone else who’s experienced this sorta phenomenon, or have I just been spendnig too much time alone with my thoughts or watching nature doucmentaries late at ngiht?

As soon as I signed the marriage certificate and prepared to consummate our new life together...he rejected me.  
“I, Than Sable, Alpha of the Amber Desert Pack, reject you Kaia Glace as my Luna.” I remember his cruel cutting words as if they were only yesterday. But they weren’t, his rejection of our mate bond was two years ago.  
The words still resound in my ears even after all this time.  
Time, I have wasted being a semi-Luna. Time wasted with a mate that doesn’t even want me.  
I’ve gone over and over again in my head what I must have said, what I did wrong, but each time I came up empty. Every time I asked him, I would get a grunt or an inaudible murmur, so I stopped asking.  
His complete reversal in character makes me feel as if I imagined our college days, as if they didn’t even exist and I was living in a dream world.  
An illusion.  
Our mate bond is non-existent. That’s a lie, it exists but he doesn’t allow himself to get close to me, doesn’t allow himself to be alone in a room with me. It’s as if I disgust him. That it pains him to get close to me.  
I hate our mate bond. The very thing that makes my heart flutter as he gets into the room, or the scent of roasted chestnuts that lingers on the furniture.  
Even his auburn shaded hair, muscular alpha body and hazel eyes I have come to hate. I hate the way the mate bond tricks me every day.  
For an entire year after our wedding there was hardly a time that I saw Than, especially alone. He became exceedingly busy with pack affairs and used it as an excuse to stay away from me.  
I tried to solve the issue I may have caused, to save our marriage. I must have done something wrong...  
But when I found out what the real problem in our marriage was, I stopped trying. I gave up...because it was just too insurmountable.  
Alora.  
She was the person that Than loved deeply, she was the reason why he never gave our mate bond a chance.  
He has thrown it away for her!  
I don’t even know who she is, where she is. All I know from snippets of information is that she was in a coma, and Than could never get over her.  
That’s when I stopped trying to work on our mate bond. I couldn’t fight against something so strong that it would overpower a mate bond….  
A mate bond that is designed by the Moon Goddess herself.  
I knew that no matter what I tried, how much I tried to change myself for him...I could never escape the curse of Alora. It was far better for my own wellbeing to just let them be.  
................  
I haven’t seen Than once in the last 2 weeks.  
Rumour has it that he’s been by Alora’s bed side every day and night. Freya also informed me that the signs of her reawakening are becoming more and more evident.  
I’ve increasingly been feeling more uncomfortable in my own skin and with Than being constantly at the hospital it has afforded me a chance to secretly get a baby test.  
I’ve not had a chance to look at it yet, I’ve been standing here for 20 minutes unable to pick it up from the sink. What if I am?  
What will that mean for this sick weird love triangle I’m finding myself in?  
“Come on Kaia, we can figure it out together. Just look at it.” My wolf encourages me to find the strength to check the result.  
With her companionship and support, I find the courage to look at the results.  
“Two lines...” I gasp, my hand clasping at my mouth.  
“Two lines...that’s good right? Means a negative?” My wolf’s voice sounds in my head.  
“No, two lines is...” I check the box again just to be certain.  
“Positive. What am I going to do?”  
The positive test sat next to me all night on my bedside table. I couldn’t keep my eyes off it. I had to check it numerous of times in the night to make sure I read the results correctly.  
Pulling myself out of bed I knew I had to tell him. As much as I hate him right now, this child is still the pack heir.  
He’ll either be at the alpha home or the hospital, and I’d rather tell him without her being in the same room. Hence, I was already heading to the alpha house first to check.  
As I reach the front garden, both he and Beta Zane head out of the front door together.  
I’m not sure what possesses me to do so, but I hide behind one of the large trees as not to be seen.  
“Why not wait until Alora wakes up to have a child?”  
“We need an heir now, to strengthen the future of this pack.”  
“What if Kaia gives you a child, and Alora wakes up?”  
“Simple, the child is mine.”  
“And Kaia?”  
“If Alora wakes up, the wolfsbane has ravaged her kidneys to a stage of disrepair. Kaia will be the organ donor. She won’t have a choice! The doctors already know the score.”  
I stop listening, blood bumping in my ears blocking out any other noise.  
Organ donor? For her?  
\*\*\*  
I watch them walk away into the distance, my mind spinning at what I had just heard.  
Kidney donation?  
I never thought that Than’s purpose was to use my kidney to save Alora...  
This is ridiculous!  
So, from beginning to end I was a meaningless existence to him. He only thought of me as just an organ donor...even though we were mates for goddess’s sake.  
He was only with me for a kidney. How could he be like this...cruel!  
My brain couldn’t think anymore, and the strong buzzing of overthinking was giving me a splitting headache. What little hope I had was shattered and I couldn’t find any reason to continue living.  
“You need to remain strong...” My wolf’s encouraging words filter into my mind.  
“...you are with child.”  
“Yes, you’re right.” I wipe away my tears, I must stay strong for the baby. I couldn’t just sit back and wait for death. I now have an innocent child to fight for.  
Suddenly, I feel as if all eyes and ears of the pack are on me, all serving Than, spies all ready to betray me.  
I can’t remain, I can’t stay and wait for Alora to wake, wait for my death. I can’t trust anybody.  
I have no choice...   
I must run!  
....  
This morning Freya said that Alora had physical reactions, showing more signs of her imminent reawakening.  
Thinking she may wake in the next few days, I planned my escape already but have now pushed it forward to tonight. I couldn’t wait any longer.  
At midnight, I waited until the cover of darkness to executive my plan of escape.  
I try my best to avoid places where pack members were on duty. I knew I needed to get to the gate, hoping the midnight shift change may be my opportunity to elude the guards.  
I’m using the path that runs adjacent to the training field, thinking no one should be training now.  
Only to find Than exercising with a warrior...  
I duck behind a tree praying to the moon goddess that I hadn’t been seen.  
They both stop, looking towards the wooded area, my heart thumping as I hide behind a tree.  
“Kaia?” His eyes scan the area as I feel him push on my mind-link. He must have seen me after all.  
Closing my eyes to concentrate, I don’t give anything away.  
I make it seem like I am asleep...not even attempting to push him out of my mind.  
Only moving again when he returns to training.  
Now changing my route, I manage to get close to the gate remaining undetected.  
I watch from the shadows, waiting for the most opportune time to escape when the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I sense someone now behind me.  
“What are you doing?” Than finds me crouched down, a humorous smirk upon his face.  
Was my life funny to him?  
“I’m leaving Than. I’m not staying anymore.” I stand up, straightening my back.  
“I don’t think so...” He takes a step towards me but is interrupted by the warrior he was training with. “Alpha? Beta Zane says you need to return to the hospital...”  
“Not now.”  
“He says, she’s awake?” The warrior seems to not understand the own words relaying on his lips from the beta’s mind-link.  
Than stares me down for a moment before spinning on his heel, his warrior following him.  
I am now left alone, this was my only chance...her reawakening giving me a chance to leave.  
I don’t give the pack grounds another look, I run straight out of the gate.  
........  
I kept running until I reached the nearest city. It didn’t take long for Than to know I left through those gates...his warriors tracking me throughout the night.  
I manage to find a secluded coffee shop where I find time to rest, my feet are burning and my throat is dry from thirst.  
I have a baby and have no pack. What should I do now? I’m not entirely sure but I know no matter what challenges are ahead of me, I refuse to return to the Amber Desert pack...to Than.  
“You aren’t from around here, which pack are you from?” The silver haired elderly coffee shop owner asks as he refills my coffee cup. He’s been watching me for a while now, knowing I am not human like the other customers.  
“No, I’m looking for someone...someone who was last seen at a pack...”  
“Which pack?” He mutters under his breath, keeping his voice low.  
“The Dark Phantom pack?” I shrug my shoulders not expecting him to have heard of the pack, but I catch his eyes glaze over slightly into a mind-link.  
“What business have you with that pack?”  
“I’m trying to track someone down. Do you have a map? Can you show me the location?” I ask with slight hope, but he shakes his head before returning to his regular customers.  
I remain for around another hour, the owner ignoring my attempts at making eye contact with him. He hasn’t returned once to me but has all the other customers.  
I return my used coffee cup to the counter, readying to settle my bill when the cute bell rings signalling the door has been opened.  
That’s when the most intoxicating scent hits me.  
Burnt oranges with dark chocolate.  
The smell invades my nostrils, the scent causing my mouth to salivate.  
With my back on the door, I turn, but I already find a tall strong male engulfing my frame from behind.

Let’s talk about MACHINE LEARNING—yes, I typed the whole word because it *deserves* to be shouted from digital rooftops! Why? Because every single day, from the apps on our phones to the algorithms streaming perfectly tailored playlists, this magical technology is sparking little moments of wonder that just weren’t possible before. I’m genuinely excited about what this means for us—all of us, not just the researchers in lab coats!

Let’s break down why machine learning is absolutely thrilling right now:

- It’s learning *like us,* only at (way) faster speeds.
- It’s handling more data in a microsecond than I could comprehend with ten cups of coffee.
- It’s finding unexpected patterns, new possibilities, “aha!” moments we might never spot on our own.

Everywhere you look, ML is busy at work:
- Predicting weather for your weekend getaway (bring that umbrella 🌧️).
- Diagnosing diseases early on—actual lifesaving magic.  
- Translating languages instantly and building bridges between communities!

And let’s not forget—ML isn’t just for tech giants. It’s empowering indie game developers, artists, and small business owners to dream bigger. You can grab open-source tools and even build your own model—right now!

But what truly makes me happy (and honestly, kinda giddy!) is seeing people tinker. No degree required for:
- Teaching your computer to recognize your dog’s *particular* face.
- Sorting your music library *just the way you want* it, automatically.
- Writing your own chatbot to respond to those endless work emails! (Goodbye, inbox dread.)

Still, machine learning isn’t just sunshine and rainbows. There are challenges—fairness, bias, privacy—the whole weighty chunk of it. Discussing these isn’t a downer, though. It’s a sign that as a community, we’re invested in making things *better*.

Here’s a thought: What excites you most about machine learning? And (hot take) what do you think is its *happiest* application so far?

I can’t wait to hear about the wild projects you’re building, the funny mishaps you hit when your model thinks your cat is a taco, or the big questions on your mind. Let’s geek out together, lift up each other's ideas, and celebrate the unlimited curiosity machine learning brings.

Keep learning, keep building, and stay awesome! 🍀

1mjw4dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/copywriting/comments/1mjw4dn/whats_the_most_unexpected_source_of_inspiration/,What’s the Most Unexpected Source of Inspiration for Your Copy?,"We all know the traditional places to find copywriting inspiration: swipe files, competitor ads, high-performing campaigns, or even classic ads from legends like Ogilvy. But sometimes the best ideas come from the most unexpected places.

I once pulled the headline for an entire homepage rewrite from a random podcast interview. It was with a small business owner who was talking about unreliable suppliers. She said, “I just want suppliers who won’t disappear on me.” That single line captured her biggest pain point. When I used a variation of it for the client (a B2B marketplace, similar to Alibaba but more niche), it resonated instantly and lifted conversions.

Other times, inspiration has come from places you wouldn’t expect. I’ve gotten ad angles from stand-up comedy (great for studying timing and structure), overheard conversations in coffee shops, and even children’s books. The key is keeping your ears and eyes open. Real-world conversations are where your audience’s true language lives, not in brainstorming documents.

Big companies do this, too. Alibaba, for example, has built entire campaigns around real small business success stories rather than traditional product messaging. Those human details can make a brand feel more relatable.

So here’s my question: What’s the most random or unexpected source of inspiration you’ve ever used in copywriting? Was it a book? A movie line? Something a client said offhand?",0,1754561342.0,copywriting,1,0.5,False

One Signature.’ — What Heartbreaking Divorce Novel Is This From?,"Four years of marriage. One signature—his own—that set me free, though he never realized what he was signing.

I was Sophia Moretti, the invisible wife of James Moretti, heir to the city’s most powerful mafia family. But when his childhood sweetheart, the dazzling and privileged Vicky, returned, I finally understood: I had always been temporary.

So I played my final move. I slid the papers across his desk—divorce disguised as routine university forms. James signed without a second glance, his fountain pen scratching across the page as carelessly as he'd treated our vows, without noticing he was ending our marriage.

But I walked away with more than my freedom. Beneath my coat, I carried his unborn heir—a secret that could destroy him when he finally realized what he'd lost.

Now, the man who never noticed me is tearing the world apart trying to find me. From his penthouse to the underworld's gutters, he's turning over every stone. But I'm not some trembling prey waiting to be found.

I rebuilt myself beyond his reach—where not even a Moretti can follow.

This time, I won't be begging for his love.

He'll be begging for mine.

Chapter 1

I walked into the law office with my divorce papers clutched in my hand. Four years. Four years as Sophia Moretti, wife of James Moretti, heir to the most powerful mafia family in the city.

Today, it ended.

The lawyer didn’t even look up when I walked in.

""I’d like to file for divorce,"" I said, placing the papers on his desk.

He finally glanced at me—messy ponytail, faded jeans, my backpack still slung over one shoulder. His expression turned stern. ""Young lady, divorce isn’t something you file on a whim.""

I understood why he didn’t take me seriously. I looked like a college student who had wandered into the wrong office, not someone who had been married for four years.

But I was prepared.

""Just stamp the papers,"" I said calmly. ""I’ll get my husband’s signature.""

The Moretti estate was too quiet when I returned. The guards at the gate didn't even blink as I passed—just another invisible fixture in James' world.

I headed straight for James' study. The door was slightly open, and I could hear laughter inside.

Then I smelled it.

Truffles.

James always said he hated strong smells in the house. No garlic, no fish, nothing that lingered. But now, the air was thick with the scent of expensive white truffles, the kind you only get if you are the right person.

I pushed the door open.

There he was. James Moretti, my husband, sitting at his desk, relaxed in a way I'd never seen with me. And beside him was Vicky Rossi, his childhood best friend, back in the city this year after her divorce.

She was feeding him a piece of bread covered in truffles, her fingers lingering just a second too long.

Then James saw me. His smile disappeared.

""Sophia,"" he said, voice cool. ""I didn't expect you back so soon.""

Vicky turned, her perfect red lips curling into a smile. ""Oh, Sophia! We were just having a snack. There's only enough for two, but I'm sure we can—”

""I'm fine."" I cut her off, stepping forward.

I slid the document across the polished mahogany desk, the rustle of paper unnaturally loud in the silent study. James barely glanced up from his whiskey with his glass froze midway to his lips. James' eyes narrowed slightly. ""What's this?""

""The university needs a signed safety liability form,"" I flipped it open to the signature page.

""For my research project,"" I swallowed. ""Since you're my only family now.""

The truth sat heavy between us. My parents had been gone for years, killed in a suspicious car accident that first pushed me into James' world. He knew better than anyone how alone I was.

James frowned, ""Let me see that—"" My nerves suddenly tightened like piano wires. He never asked to read anything. Normally he'd just sign whatever university paperwork I put in front of him without a second glance.

Why today? Why now?

""Oh James,"" Vicky laughed, placing a hand on his arm. ""You're too serious! It's just a form. You remember how many forms we had to sign for the charity gala last month?""

As the heiress to Rossi Enterprises, one of the Moretti family's most important business partners, Vicky had moved effortlessly in James' world since her return. They were always together now, at galas, auctions, and those smoky backroom poker games where deals got made. Everywhere James went these days, Vicky seemed to appear at his elbow, her designer dresses complementing his tailored suits like they were a matched set.

He hesitated, then grabbed his fountain pen and signed with a quick flourish, the same way he signed death warrants and business deals.

I took the papers back before he could see the bold ""DIVORCE PETITION"" header on the first page.

Vicky smirked, ""Honestly, James, you treat her more like a kid sister than a wife.""

James didn't deny it. Just took a sip of whiskey.

I turned and walked out before they could see my hands shake.

The door closed behind me.

I was free.

Walking through the marble halls of the Moretti mansion, I clutched the signed divorce papers in my hand. The ink was barely dry, but the marriage had been over long before today.

I remembered how different James used to be. The way his warm hands would trace my spine when he thought I was asleep. The possessive way he'd pull me into shadowed corners at family gatherings, his mouth hot against mine.

Now he barely looked at me.

My parents died when I was sixteen. Don Moretti, the reigning head of the Moretti mafia family at the time, took me in as a favor to my father—his former driver who'd taken a bullet for him. That's how I ended up living under the same roof as James Moretti.

James was everything I shouldn't want. Cold. Dangerous. Ruthless. By twenty-five, he'd already taken over half his father's operations. The newspapers called him a ""young entrepreneur."" The streets knew better.

I kept my distance at first. Made myself invisible. Until that night four years ago, when James came home covered in someone else's blood.

He found me in the kitchen patching up my own knife wound, a gift from one of his father's men who thought the boss's charity case made easy prey.

James didn't speak. Just took the bandages from my shaking hands and cleaned the cut himself. When his thumb brushed my inner thigh, I should have pushed him away.

Instead, I pulled him closer.

We married three weeks later. A business arrangement, James called it. Protection for me, legitimacy for him. I almost believed him—until Vicky Rossi came back to town and suddenly his late meetings doubled.

Vicky. The Rossi heiress. Their construction empire worked closely with the Moretti family. Since returning after her divorce, And now that her French husband had filed for divorce, she'd become a constant presence——slipping into James' meetings, his cars, his life.

Last month proved it.

I'd waited six hours at Dante's—the restaurant James owned through a shell company—for our anniversary dinner. His right-hand man Michael finally showed up at midnight with a diamond bracelet and an excuse about ""business troubles.""

The next morning, I saw the photos in the gossip column: James and Vicky at the opera, her fingers tucked in his tuxedo pocket where he usually kept his gun.

That's when I started planning my exit.

The divorce papers were my final exam. James signed them without reading—too distracted by Vicky feeding him stolen glances and stolen kisses.

Now, standing in the mansion's gilded foyer, I traced the notary's embossed seal with my thumb. In a month, this paper would be my ticket to freedom.

No more gilded cages. No more pretending.

James could keep his empire. His violence. His Vicky.

I wanted my life back.

Chapter 2

Vicky claimed her penthouse needed renovations after her return. That’s how she ended up in our guest suite—temporarily, of course.

James approved it before I could object. ""The Rossis have been business partners for for decades,"" he said, as if that explained everything.

Now she floated through our home like she owned it—lounging by the pool in designer bikinis, hosting her parties in our wine cellar, always finding reasons to interrupt when James and I were alone.

Tonight, I caught them in the study, heads bent over some legal documents. Vicky’s long finger traced a line on the paper, lingering too close to James’ hand.

""Sophia!"" She smiled when she noticed me. ""We're planning my new home theater. You should join us.""

""I have lab reports to grade,"" I said, clutching my nightgown. We're divorced now. Whatever James does. Whoever he's with. It's none of my business.

Vicky's laugh tinkled like broken glass. ""Always buried in your books! James used to do my math homework when we were kids - you tutored me yourself, didn't you James? My math skills are all thanks to you.""

James chuckled lightly. ""Math was simpler than laundering casino profits."" His eyes flicked briefly to me, a silent check for reaction.

I kept my face carefully blank, staring at my feet. How touching, their childhood bond still going strong after all these years. I'd just be here, counting the days until I could escape this charming reunion.

By midnight, I was reviewing lab data when James entered our bedroom. The scent of whiskey and Vicky’s cloying perfume clung to his shirt as he sat beside me on the bed.

""Still working?"" His fingers brushed my shoulder.

I stiffened instinctively. Yet when his hand slid down my spine, I arched into his touch like a starving woman offered crumbs.

Pathetic, some rational part of my brain whispered. But four years of loneliness had carved a hollow space inside me that only James could temporarily fill, even if he'd never stay.

His lips found my neck as he unbuttoned the front of my nightgown. I closed my eyes and let myself forget—

—until my stomach turned violently.

""Sophia?"" James froze as I clapped a hand over my mouth.

The queasy feeling disappeared as fast as it hit me. ""Just...ate something odd at the lab today,"" I offered weakly. The birth control pills I took religiously made pregnancy impossible, but my stomach seemed to rebel at the thought of Vicky sleeping right beneath us while James touched me.

Just then, a crash came from downstairs.

""James?"" Vicky’s voice floated up the staircase, trembling. ""I heard glass breaking... I think someone’s in the house.""

I felt James’ body tense. Duty called.

He was out of bed before I could speak, grabbing the pistol from his nightstand. ""Stay here,"" he ordered, already halfway to the door.

Turned out to be nothing—just the housekeeper dropping a plate. But when James returned hours later, he went straight to the shower without a word. I pretended to be asleep.

The next morning, I nearly choked on my coffee when I saw James flipping through my research institute application forms—the ones I’d stupidly left on the kitchen counter. My stomach tightened.

""Biomedical engineering?"" He held up the application to the Swiss institute's application, his brow arched. "" When did you arrange this overseas project?""

I forced a shrug. ""My classmate asked me to grab the forms for her."" My fingers curled into my palms—out of sight, out of mind—but not before I caught the faint tremor in my pinky finger. Damn it.

James turned a page, scanning the details. ""Zurich. You’d hate the snow.""

Of course he didn’t remember. Two winters ago, I’d dragged him to a cabin in Vermont just to watch the flakes fall. He’d spent the whole time on the phone with his lawyers.

I didn't respond. Just look at him coldly.

He set down his coffee, his dark eyes locking onto mine with unsettling intensity. ""You don’t need another degree. I could appoint you lead researcher at Moretti Medical tomorrow.""

That’s the problem. Every achievement I had, every paper, every grant, was shadowed by the Moretti name. I opened my mouth to retort when Vicky’s laughter cut through the tension.

""Morning, darlings!"" She breezed in, her silk robe fluttering as she perched on the arm of James’ chair. ""James, the lawyers need us to review the new casino contracts before noon."" Her slender fingers brushed against James' shoulder in a familiar gesture.

James stood up without another glance at my applications. ""We’ll take it in the study.""

As they disappeared down the hall, I yanked the forms back. My hand steadied as I reached the Marital Status.

Single.

Chapter 3

The research fellowship in Switzerland would last for four years. The director had emailed twice already, eager for me to start by fall. Four years abroad. Far from James. Far from Vicky. I sent ""Accept"" before I could overthink it.

Last night played on repeat in my mind. I'd actually considered—just one last time—initiating something with James. A final memory to take with me. But he'd spent the evening with Vicky, probably whispering sweet nothings under the moon.

That's the difference between love and...whatever this is.

What I couldn't understand was how a man could feign desire so convincingly for someone he didn't love. To prevent a repeat of last night's humiliation, I decided to clear out my things today. Three weeks until the divorce was finalized. Three weeks of avoiding this house.

Most of my life was already at campus housing—just one suitcase of clothes here. The only personal item was the photo album in the nightstand.

I flipped through the thick leather cover. Every month like clockwork, I'd dragged James to a photo studio. Me smiling like an idiot. Him stiff as a statue, looking anywhere but at the camera.

The album landed in the trash bin with a thud. Even the recycling truck wouldn't want this tainted love story.

For years, I'd been an audience member in James Moretti's life. Now the curtain had fallen. Time to make my exit.

The next two weeks blurred with thesis revisions and lab work. I barely thought of James—until his call interrupted my Friday research meeting.

""I'm outside your lab,"" his voice crackled through the phone.

Since when does James Moretti play chauffeur?

His black sedan idled at the curb. I slid into the leather seat, inhaling the familiar scent of his cologne and gun oil.

""You haven't been home."" His eyes stayed on the road.

""Lab's busy.""

""Good."" His fingers tapped the steering wheel. ""Vicky thought you were avoiding her. She's moving out next month—says it's 'inappropriate' now.""

I yawned. ""Tell her not to bother. I don't care.""

James' grip tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles paling to bone-white. A flicker of surprise crossed his face. He opened his mouth—probably to praise my ""maturity""—but stopped when he noticed my closed eyes.

I feigned sleep to avoid conversation, but the exhaustion was real. For the first time in years, my dreams weren't about him.

Ten days until Switzerland.

I stood in the supermarket aisle, staring at the dried hawthorn slices in my hand. I hadn't eaten these since childhood, but lately my stomach churned at everything else. My recent period had also been delayed.

The pregnancy test confirmed my fears.

""twelve weeks along,"" the doctor said cheerfully. ""Congratulations!""

I nearly laughed. Twelve weeks. That meant it happened during James' and my last time together—right before Vicky returned.

My hands shook as I dialed James' number. At twenty-four, facing this alone terrified me—

A familiar ringtone echoed down the hallway.

James stood twenty feet away, his black coat draped over Vicky's shoulders as she whispered something that made him smile. I hung up and ducked into the stairwell.

""—avoid strenuous activity,"" the doctor's voice carried through the cracked door. ""And no intercourse for two months.""

Vicky was pregnant too.

""I'll make sure she rests,"" James said, that tender tone I rarely heard.

I shot out of the stairwell like a bullet, desperate to escape, only to crash straight into a nurse carrying medical charts. The papers went flying as we collided, creating just enough noise to draw attention from down the hall.

James emerged from the examination room just in time to see me scrambling to help pick up the scattered documents, my face burning with the effort to appear composed.

""Sophia?"" He frowned, stepping forward. ""Why are you here?""

""Stomachache."" I crumpled the ultrasound slip in my pocket.

Vicky materialized beside him, clutching her own scan. ""James told me you skip meals."" She patted his arm. ""We should get her some ginger tea.""

I couldn't tear my eyes away from the ultrasound photo in Vicky's hand. The grainy black-and-white image seemed to pulse under the harsh hospital lights.

James' face went pale. ""Sophia, let me expl—""

""James!"" Vicky's fingers dug into his sleeve like claws, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ""We talked about this.""

I saw the conflict play out across his face, the way his muscles tensed, how his hand twitched before curling into a fist.

Then Vicky pressed her cheek against his shoulder, whispering something that made him freeze. His arm dropped to his side like a dead weight.

I turned away before they could see my face crumple. Behind me, I heard James take a half-step forward—

""James!"" Vicky's voice turned sharp. ""You promised.""

The elevator doors closed on the image of my husband standing frozen between two women, his eyes locked on me with something that almost looked like regret.

Outside, winter air slapped my face. The research acceptance letter lay buried at the bottom of my backpack. Four years. A groundbreaking study. A life far from this mess.

And now—a baby.

My hand rested on my stomach—still flat, but everything had changed. The sidewalk stretched endlessly in both directions.

For the first time in my life, I had nowhere to go.

Chapter 4

For forty-eight hours, I'd been drafting and deleting emails to the research institute. How do I tell the director I accidentally pregnant by my soon-to-be-ex husband? My fingers hovered over the keyboard when my phone buzzed.

Michael: Boss wants to see you at the gates.

Since when did James send his right-man as a messenger boy?

I spotted James leaning casually against his Mercedes, the morning sunlight softening his sharp features in a way that made my breath catch for a moment. The way the light traced his jawline, the slight crinkle at the corners of his eyes as he noticed my approach - it was unfair how my pulse still quickened at the sight of him after everything.

I quickly looked away, fingers fumbling with my backpack strap as if it demanded all my attention. Four years of marriage, and my traitorous body still reacted to him like we were newlyweds. The heat that rose to my cheeks, the way my skin remembered his touch - biological betrayals I refused to acknowledge. Old habits, I told myself firmly. Just muscle memory, nothing more.

""Sophia."" He removed his glasses, revealing those dark eyes that used to make my knees weak. ""Dinner tomorrow. Dante's. Eight o'clock.""

Dante's. The name alone sent acid creeping up my throat. That was where I'd sat for six hours on our anniversary, staring at cold osso buco while James ""handled business"" with Vicky.

""I'll be there,"" I heard myself say, the words leaping from my lips before I could temper them. The automatic response surprised even me—why so eager to sit across from the man who'd chosen Vicky over me at every turn?

But hesitation would raise suspicions. James could smell weakness like blood in the water. If I was going to keep this baby—and I had every intention to—I needed to do things right. Hiding the pregnancy meant nothing if I didn't first sever all legal ties between us. James Moretti wasn't the type to let anything slip through his fingers, least of all a child. And if he ever found out I'd kept his heir from him...

No. The divorce had to come first. Clean. Official. Irreversible.

This dinner would serve two purposes: First, the divorce. Then, when oceans separated us, I'd decide how to tell him about the baby. If ever.

The restaurant's chandeliers cast knife-sharp shadows across the white tablecloths. Tonight, he'd chosen the private wine cellar where we'd had our first date.

His fingers wrapped around mine as he set down the Barolo bottle—not just brushing past, but actually holding my hand for the first time in four years.

""There's something I need to explain about what happened—""

The cellar door crashed open. Michael rushed to his side, whispering urgently against his ear. But in the tomb-like quiet of the stone-walled cellar, the words ""Vicky"", ""cut her wrist"" and ""emergency"" slithered to my ears regardless.

My stomach dropped. Of course. Even our last dinner couldn't be just ours.

James' grip on my hand released as he shot to his feet, his chair screeching backward before toppling with a crash. ""What?!""

The room spun. My vision tunneled until all I could see was James' retreating back, his coat flaring like a cape.

He paused at the doorway just long enough to glance between Michael and me—a fraction of a second's calculation. ""Take her to the hospital,"" he ordered before disappearing up the stairs.

Then—nothing.

Fragments of conversation drifted through the haze:

""...just low blood sugar...""

""...get her some orange juice...""

My eyelids fluttered open to blurred shapes - the doctor speaking with Michael by the doorway. A jolt of panic shot through me as consciousness returned. If they discover the pregnancy...

The doctor leaned closer to Michael, her voice dropping to a murmur. ""And considering the patient's condit—""

My dry throat constricted. I had to stop her—

BRRRRT!

Michael's phone screamed like a fire alarm. He ripped it from his pocket, the caller ID making him snap to attention. ""Yes, boss?"" A beat. His jaw tightened. ""Understood. On my way now, sir.""

He slapped a black credit card onto the doctor's clipboard. ""Keep her here till New Year's if you want."" The door rattled in its frame as he vanished, the doctor's lips still parted around the unspoken ""pregnant"".

""Ah, you're awake."" She turned to me, oblivious to my racing pulse. ""You're approximately thirteen weeks along. Baby's healthy, but given your collapse..."" Her pen scratched across a notepad. ""We'll keep you 48 hours for monitoring.""

She hesitated, glancing at the door. ""I didn't mention this to your... companion earlier.""

I exhaled in quiet relief. ""No. And please keep it that way.""

As the doctor stepping out, the nurses' hushed voices slithered under the curtain:

"" Mr. and Mrs. Moretti are like royalty—They've turned Suite 801 into a penthouse - rose petals, champagne, the works. Mr. Moretti hasn't left her side since admission.""

""Would you expect less? Did you see how he carried her through the lobby? Like some romantic film.""

A sigh. ""Ten years together and he still treats her like a bride. Meanwhile my husband forgets our anniversary...""

Their words cut deeper than any knife. There was no question – they could only be talking about James and Vicky.

""Of course he's devoted – Mrs. Moretti's finally giving him an heir. Mr. Moretti’d commanded an army of specialists at her slightest sigh.""

James treated Vicky like a queen. I became acutely aware of my chipped nail polish against the starch hospital sheets - the lone Moretti wife no one remembered to pamper.

After two nights of observation with no complications, I was discharged.

Stepping out of the hospital's automatic doors, I spotted Emma waiting by the curb, the manila envelope clutched in her hands.

Stepping through the hospital's sliding doors, my first stop was the courthouse to collect the divorce decree. As I arranged for James' copy to be mailed—with a deliberate three-day delay—a quiet satisfaction settled in my chest.

By the time this reaches his desk, I thought, watching the clerk stamp the postmark, I'll be in Zurich. Let the mighty James Moretti turn over every stone in the world. But even his power has limits—and I just became one of them.

The envelope disappeared into the mailbox with a soft thud—four years of love, lies and loneliness now condensed into a single document that would chase my shadow across the ocean.

Chapter 5

I stared at the sent email—the one confessing my pregnancy to the Swiss institute. Now, there was nothing to do but wait. I placed my hand on my stomach almost unconsciously, as if to reassure us both.

The director replied within hours:

""Congratulations on this new chapter! We've prepared family housing just steps from the lab, and Dr. Laurent's wife, our chief obstetrician, has personally reserved all your prenatal appointments. Most importantly—we're dispatching a team member to escort you from the airport door to your new home. No luggage handling, no queues, no stress whatsoever!""

I stared at the screen. No hesitation. No judgment. Just support. Something tightened in my chest—maybe the first real hope I'd felt since seeing those two pink lines.

""Thank you,"" I typed back, ""for valuing me beyond my current circumstances.""

On the day of my departure, I stood nervously at the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd for my institute contact. A voice called out - ""Sophia?""

I turned to see a lanky man with gentle eyes pushing through the crowd. Eric, according to his badge, greeted me with a warmth that immediately put me at ease. He took my single suitcase carefully, as if handling rare artifacts. ""Priority boarding is ready,"" he smiled. ""The director insisted on VIP treatment for our star researcher.""

As Eric maneuvered toward me, his shoulder briefly blocked my view of a commotion near the VIP lounge—where James stood with Vicky clinging to his arm, their backs turned as they greeted a group of Middle Eastern businessmen.

At that precise moment, James stiffened.

""Did someone just call Sophia?""

Vicky's crystalline laugh bounced off. ""Don't be ridiculous, James. Sophia is probably buried in lab right now."" Vicky said as she pulled James toward a champagne reception.

We disappeared into the shuffling queue before his gaze could sweep our direction.

As we walked toward the gate, Eric animatedly described the lab's new two-photon microscope. ""Dr. Laurent had it installed specifically for your protein research,"" he said, eyes bright with the kind of academic passion I'd nearly forgotten existed.

He adjusted his grip on my suitcase. ""Oh, and the team unanimously voted to adopt your preferred schedule—no morning meetings before nine, and absolutely no evening work.""

I pressed a hand to my sternum. These people, who'd never met me, had tried hard to anticipate my needs better than James ever had in four years of marriage.

At security, Eric handed me a stack of postcards—the Alps glittering under cheap gloss. ""For writing home,"" he said with an encouraging nod.

The trash bin swallowed them whole.

Eric blinked. ""No one to write to?""

I glanced back at the terminal windows, where the city skyline stood sharp against the dawn. Somewhere out there, James was probably reviewing Vicky's latest ultrasound photos over breakfast, her diamond-crusted hand resting on his arm.

""Not anymore,"" I said, turning toward the gate.

The plane rumbled to life beneath us. Eric prattled about Zurich's farmer's markets—""The peaches in August! You'll think you've tasted sunlight!""—while I pressed a hand to the window.

Goodbye to photos where only one of us smiled.

Goodbye to the mansion that never felt like home.

Goodbye, James.

I’m looking to build a strong friendship with mutual support. I’m a pretty regular dude with an irregular need for attention. I also have a lot of attention to give. Just looking for friendship but not against ocasional flirty talk 

I’m 32 straight, single. Into nerdy shit. Im pretty accepting and of all. Liberal. Pizza lover. Dogs>cats. I don’t drink coffee. I drink alcohol occasionally, 420 friendly. Love talking about music and sharing. Idk what to write here. It’s almost 6am. Let’s be friends. 

Often up for voice chat. Will share picture once comfortable. HMU if you think we’d get along.

Maybe it's not natural, but I personally like my friendships and family separate, and there's obviously like- hidden understandings I assume.

I've been talking to my mom about a certain friend from work, who I really enjoy, we've gotten coffee a couple times and she visits my house.

My mom replies with ""yeah, I saw her recent post on Instagram!""

...to which I ask, if she followed her? My mom tells me yes- and it just makes me so uncomfortable, because why?

My mom just said, she's nice, which sure?

But, my mom has never met this person in real life, they've never spoken before, it just feels so weird.

I've never went out of my way to interact with my mom's friends, or force my presence to be known.

And, she's done this in the past, multiple times.

Any friends I have, even coworkers I don't interact with much, she like- ""injects"" herself in, and has to follow them on all social media's for some reason.

And eventually, she messages them privately and it just feels weird.

I don't get it, why the desperation to interact with these people at all, when it's my life, and not hers? These are my friends and people I know for real, she doesn't?

Am I weird to be upset??

My mom said she's gonna unfollow this friend now but, if the friend asks my mom why she unfollowed her, she'll tell them it's because it made ME upset.

Which, I doubt the friend would notice or care?

It just feels wrong, and arguing with my mom doesn't help, because I'm basically the one overreacting about this.",1,1754560730.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

The job is to work at the counter, there are orders for pastries, I put them in plate and put in the counter - Starbucks style. Plus going around the place every 10 minutes, cleaning counters, tables and plates. Standing all day, no phones allowed.

Opening at 6:20, I had a single cig break for 10 minutes at 9am, at 11 while rush hour is over I took my launch break after routine cleanup. Set with friends who were at the place, table in front of us got up and didn't cleanup after themselves.

Manager comes to me, ""maybe you should end your launch break now"". I apologize to the friends. Then she tells me I should ""consider my coworkers who didn't eat yet"", I tell her my launch break was only 15 minutes, place is barely empty. She goes on a rant about how they expect us to care about the place, and if I see a table in dirty ""even in the middle of a bite"" I should stop my break, clean it and go back. Then she fires me.

1. Screw her.

2. My vent - I've worked in multiple jobs, some office jobs as IT or SW. And some minimum wage jobs - warehouse, printing house and now this coffee shop (New in town, the SW market is hard and I needed the money). The only jobs where people ratted each other out were the minimum wage jobs. The only jobs where management measured my launch break were minimum wage.

Job is hard enough and not rewarding, why do the people make it even harder than it needed to be? At this job 2 semi managers (2$ more per hour) competed with each other and on the first day I saw one of them ratting the other out. A coworker ratted me out because I forgot to change the bin, she could just come and say it to me, but instead she told it to the manager.

On the printing place a coworker ratted me out because I threw away material after a bad print and didn't report it (3$ board). He saw me do it and didn't tell me anything, just went to management. Didn't even mean to hide it, I worked there for a week and didn't know this need to be reported.

Why do they compete with each other? There's no fucking reward.",3,1754560727.0,antiwork,2,1.0,False

In the first week of our meeting, I visited the cafe three mornings in a row as usual, ordered my coffee, and proceeded to work as usual. On the third visit, Maria began to be more friendly and memorized my order, as is typical with regular customers.

The following week, I saw Maria at the service elevator. I said,

- “Maria, right?” Maria responds with, “Yes, what’s your name?”I remembered I never introduced myself to Maria in our earlier interactions) tells her my first and last name. Maria follows up with  asking how I spell my last name since there are multiple ways to spell it. I commented on Maria’s double espresso shot she had in her hand, and Maria says she drinks the coffee from a different cafe in the building (not the one she works at) because she likes the flavor profile more. I laughed and walked away. 

The second week, I had to come in the office early, and Maria is working with another person. While Maria is ringing up my order, I asked “how is your week going?” And Maria responds with “good, it’s been busy! How’s yours”. I jokingly say the week has been tough because I had been traveling the last couple of days. Maria asks “where have you been traveling”, and I reply “I was in XYZ for a couple days for work. It feels like it should be Friday.” Maria says “I’ve never been to XYZ” and I respond with a laugh and say “You’re not missing much.” Maria then says she is a streamer and chats with all kinds of people over  the world, but she hasn’t traveled much”. I playfully respond with “Oh really? I never really understood streaming, are you playing games or something else?” Maria responds with a laugh and says “that’s what most people think, but I am just talking to people so it’s fun.”

I returned to the cafe with a colleague a couple hours later to get a second coffee for the day. The other worker takes my order, and Maria seemingly jumps up from her seat to ring me up. I jokingly tell her I needed a second coffee for the day and not to judge me, and Maria responds with a laugh and says “I’ve had two coffees today too! I am not judging you!” I moved to the pickup line and walked away as another customer comes up to the counter.

I think Maria is attractive and I obviously want to escalate it, but I have to be aware that she’s at work, there is a social dynamic here where neither of us most likely wouldn't push the boundaries, and she could just be being friendly.

1mjvu0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mjvu0e/moving_3_hours_away_from_my_son/,Moving 3 hours away from my son,"No idea if this is the right thread to post in

I know the majority is going to think I’m an asshole for even considering this but here goes..

I (M32) have a son (M10), and separated from his mother when he was 2. I have 50/50 custody. 

During the year before I found out my ex was pregnant, I was planning to leave my hometown, and only come back to visit family during holidays. When I found out we were having a baby, I changed my plans and I stayed solely to be here for my son. He is now 10, and while I love him more than anything, the feelings of wanting to leave have never gone away. My life is devoted to my son, and I feel it’s having an impact on my own happiness. 

Another thing to note, 4 years ago I met the most amazing woman (Currently F28) that changed my world, she was absolutely perfect and we shared the most wonderful love together. The thing is, she lived 3 hours away when we met. We did long distance for 2 years, and then she moved to be with me. Everything was great. From the day we met, I had always said I want to move out of my home town once my son is old enough to understand why daddy moved away. I’d give him the option to go with me, but I’d never force him to leave his mother, and I understand it’s highly likely that given the choice, he’d probably choose to stay here with her anyway.

My son adored my partner, and she was incredible with him. 

Over the past 1.5 years, it kept coming up that my partner wanted to have children of our own and raise them back home close to her family. I am all for that, and prepared to move 3hrs to be with her family, I just can’t do it yet as my son is only 10 and I had always told her, I could not move any earlier than once he is in high school. 

A few months ago, we separated, because she felt I would never move, and I can’t give anything other than my word to prove to her that I’d go through with it when the time was right. And to be honest, at the time I wasn’t really 100% sure if I could. I know deep down that she is my human, and this time apart has truly cemented how much I want to be with her and do whatever it takes to make it work, even if that means being further away from my son and only seeing him in the holidays. We’ve kept in contact and caught up for coffee a few times, and I know her feelings for me haven’t changed just as mine haven’t changed for her. 

I guess what I’m wanting to know, at what point does it become ok to put myself and my happiness first? The sad truth is our kids grow up, move out of home and leave us all in the end anyway.. 

I fear I will mess my son up by him spending his teenage years without a father there in person. I know we can always call and FaceTime as much as he likes, and 3hrs isn’t really that far to travel, I travelled it every second weekend for 2 years when my partner and I were doing long distance. 

Has anybody got experience with moving away from their children and things working out ok?

I’m prepared for whatever hate this will bring in the comments. ",1,1754560303.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

TLDR for that: found out after I joined the lab over half of his previous students left the lab, and he openly bad-mouthed one of our other students to me in a collaborator at a meeting.

My note this time is really how to go about maintaining a level head while not going off on him my last year. This is what happened on Monday. I got in at 6am, did an experiment all day and was in intermittently until 9pm. It failed, stuff happens, but I was too tired and was going to prep for another one Wednesday. He comes down to sporadically see us at 3:30pm on Tuesday to tell him we have a meeting Wednesday at 11am and to present what we have so far. This meant I had a lot of analysis to do and was at lab until 11pm and went in at 7:30am on Wednesday to get more work done. I was in lab until 3:45pm and I guess he came down at 4:00pm to find nobody there. I then got a scathing email saying that nobody was there, he sees other grad students in their labs (they’re my friends, they come in closer to 11am-noon and leave at 5pm). I responded to the email calmly saying I just missed him in the lab and was on a break, and that I was coming back afterwards. He then just kept going off about how we don’t work or get anything done and I’m just kind of checked out because it was such a stupid tantrum I felt as though I was talking to a child.

Anyone have any advice with regards to how to dial it back in to emotionally check in when this happens? That’s probably the largest bottleneck. When he acts this why I just lose an increasing amount of respect for him and ultimately feel like my boss is a child, which makes me not want to work for him. I’m thinking about working standard 9-5 hours (I currently do 6am-8pm with around 10-12 hours of work with breaks in between to go to the gym, grab coffee, etc). But honestly my productivity would go down if I did that. 

Any words of wisdom would be appreciated. I already worked the day after I got a concussion last year, to which he thought I should… yeah. It’s that bad, just need advice with regards to how to finish this thing.",2,1754560197.0,GradSchool,0,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Perth for over 6 years now as an international student (just finished my engineering degree 🎓), and I’ve realised something kinda sad! I don’t really have any close local friends here.

I’m friendly, open-minded, and would genuinely love to connect with someone for chats, coffee, walks, or just hanging out. But I’ve found it really hard to meet people outside of work or uni. Is it just me, or is it actually tough to make real friendships in Perth as an adult! especially for someone who moved here from overseas?

1mjvsbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1mjvsbe/the_local_dating_scene_why_has_it_become_so_bad/,The local dating scene (why has it become so bad?),"Right going to preface this with a little background. 33m and I was in a relationship for nearly 4 years which ended just before Christmas. Took some time to myself to get past the break up and work out what I want from any future partner. Met my ex through the apps so I know they can work and wouldn’t have an issue getting matches and dates from them. So I felt kinda confident when I went back on the apps to date again it would be similar to how it was back in 2019/2020. Turns out I was very wrong.

So I went back on the apps in May, first thing I noticed is a lot of the same people from 2019/2020 using the apps. So I think maybe they’re  just unlucky and found themselves single again like myself but their profiles look eerily similar to how I remembered 4/5 years ago. As I keep swiping I also noticed there just isn’t as many people using the apps (woman in this case) so I think again maybe that’s normal as more people settle as they get older and the dating pool gets smaller. But there’s just a feeling in general with the apps I couldn’t shake, almost like no one on them was actually interested in dating and felt more like a social media account than a dating profile. 

Anyway, I start matching and going on dates. Straight away I’m getting mixed signals from people (saying they had a good time on the date maybe go on a 2nd date then the conversations just die out) this isn’t new and happens but it seems to be more common now. I’ve also found a few dates say to me that they didn’t feel a connection after a 1 hour coffee date where the conversation flowed, both seemed to be getting on but that doesn’t seem to be enough for a 2nd date. I don’t think I’ve ever had an instant connection with anyone I’ve been on a first date with from an app before rather feelings grow over time. It kinda feels like there’s an unrealistic expectation for this instant spark/fireworks with a stranger over a coffee. I had one date that was actually pretty bad, she was very drunk and got abit anti men towards the end of the date that threw me off. Just felt very out of the blue and more targeted at men she’s dated in the past. Weirdly she was keen to meet again but I wasn’t based on how much her personality seemed to changed at the end of the date. 

So I was talking to a friend about this recently who’s been single longer than me. They basically confirmed their own experience was similar, same people on the apps, good dates that go nowhere and dealing with people who don’t want to meet up when using a dating app and mixed signals.

Basically, what has happened over the last 4 years to make the dating scene so bad? I’m not going to romanticised dating apps in the past, they have always been abit crap but it feels like it’s on a new level of crap now. Has anyone had much success from them recently, especially in your 30s?

Stopped in at the Birregurra Grocer (if you know, you know! Killer coffee, and that old-town charm), and it made for the perfect break. The Super Meteor handled the winding back roads like a dream enough grunt to make it fun, but still relaxed enough to soak in the scenery.

I rode out with my partner on her CMX500, and we both agreed: midweek rides beat the weekend crowds any day. Quiet roads, friendly locals, and time to just enjoy the ride without rushing.

The 650 twin is so smooth, and the ergonomics on this thing are spot-on for longer rides. If you’re thinking about a Super Meteor do it. Royal Enfield nailed it.

Stopped in at the Birregurra Grocer (if you know, you know! Killer coffee, and that old-town charm), and it made for the perfect break. The Super Meteor handled the winding back roads like a dream enough grunt to make it fun, but still relaxed enough to soak in the scenery.

I rode out with my partner on her CMX500, and we both agreed: midweek rides beat the weekend crowds any day. Quiet roads, friendly locals, and time to just enjoy the ride without rushing.

The 650 twin is so smooth, and the ergonomics on this thing are spot-on for longer rides. If you’re thinking about a Super Meteor do it. Royal Enfield nailed it.

Anyone else take a midweek ride lately to clear the head?

1mjvnfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1mjvnfz/this_one_was_so_frustrating_a_crossover_with/,"This one was so frustrating, a crossover with false awakening","I'm dreaming good stuff, me and my boyfriend are hanging out with friends and having a good time. Two friends of mine finally kiss and we're happy for them. We agree they'll be sleeping at our place for the night.

We all walk together to a cliff, there are beautiful waterfalls and birds flying off them.  
While walking, the dream starts to become less nice... I can't walk properly anymore. My legs don't work and I'm having trouble moving forward. My boyfriend asks me if I'm all right because I can't walk properly and my face looks weird??  
When he asks this, I snap out of it and I can walk and move forward again.

We look at the waterfalls and the birds fly toward us, it's extremely beautiful! Suddenly the water becomes stormy and starts flowing over and towards our feet. My boyfriend tells me to stay put because the water could pull me down and drag me away.

Again, my legs start acting up and I take a step backward. Ofcourse... the water pulls me down, away and drags me into something like an underground subway station that's overflowing. It pulls me down, over the stairs at high speed, dragging me deeper and deeper .

It suddenly spits me out at the same spot where I'm laying on the couch. I open my eyes and look around. I'm disoriented at first but soon realize I'm looking at my own hands, pillow, and coffee table. This is when I realize I can't move. I try to move my hands but nothing happens. They feel tingly and asleep.  
I try to get up, nothing happens. I try this a few times and I finally manage to sit up, but I blink, and I'm back in the same spot, lying down again.  
I get a bit frustrated. I look at my fingers and they turn to ice. I try to move them again, nothing happens.

I try again and am able to sprint off the couch. I see some mattresses and pillows on my right, which tells me my friends are probably over like we agreed and they're probably upstairs.  
I stand at the door, wanting to go upstairs. I turn the light on. I blink and AGAIN I'm lying in the same position on my couch, not moving.

I'm really really getting annoyed at this point.  
I try to swing myself up, but nothing happens. After a few tries it finally works but the moment I'm up, I blink and I'm back down again, stuck in the same position.  
This happens 3–4 more times of me frustrated, swinging myself up, blinking, and being stuck again in the same position I started in.

I give up and lay there, thinking I need to do this differently because this approach isn't working.  
I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and say to myself: ""I'm just laying on my couch, watching TV.""  
Suddenly, my vision widens and snaps to the TV (which had been off the whole time) ,and now suddenly it's on again. The mattresses and pillows are gone. I can move my fingers again.  
Finally… I'm awake.

1mjvmjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetGripesAndGlor/comments/1mjvmjj/how_does_the_greenpan_rice_cooker_stand_out_among/,How Does the GreenPan Rice Cooker Stand Out Among Compact Models?,"The GreenPan CC006770-001 rice cooker has been a very reliable addition to my kitchen, and after using it consistently for several weeks, I can confidently share my detailed experience with this compact yet feature-packed appliance. Although I was initially drawn to it because of its promise of healthy cooking and user-friendly design, it's not without a few trade-offs. Here's what stood out to me using this rice cooker daily.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This rice cooker is incredibly compact, measuring just 6 inches deep and wide and 8 inches high. It fits perfectly on my crowded kitchen counter, which is already home to a coffee maker, blender, and air fryer. The sleek white finish gives it a clean, modern aesthetic, and the cool-touch exterior is a thoughtful addition—no accidental burns here when reaching over it. I also appreciate its light weight of just over 9 pounds, making it easy to move or clean around. The ceramic nonstick interior is both functional and attractive, and it claims to be PFAS-free, which was a selling point for me since I aim to use products that align with healthier cooking methods. However, I have noticed the ceramic bowl feels a bit delicate, so I handle it with extra care when cleaning to avoid chipping.  

**Cooking Performance**  
This little machine does an excellent job handling a variety of grains. I’ve tested the presets for white rice, brown rice, quinoa, and steel-cut oats, and the results have largely been consistent. The “Smart Grain” fuzzy logic technology is a game-changer—it adjusts cooking times and temperatures to optimize texture. I was particularly impressed with how fluffy the white rice turned out, something I usually struggled with on the stovetop. Steel-cut oats, however, required a minor adjustment to the water ratio, which took me a couple of tries to perfect.  

**Ease of Use**  
Using this rice cooker is surprisingly straightforward, even for someone who has never used one before. The vibrant LED display is clear and intuitive, and the easy-to-use presets eliminate the guessing game. My favorite features have to be the delay timer and adjustable timing. Having the ability to prepare ingredients at night and wake up to perfectly cooked oatmeal is a morning game changer. However, I did find myself using the provided measuring cup and fill lines religiously at first, as slight mismeasurements could lead to slightly mushy or undercooked rice. Now that I’ve gotten the hang of it, cooking is mostly foolproof.  

[Check GreenPan CC006770-001 price on Amazon.](https://kitchenchampions.com/p/b0b72f133y/)  

**Advantages**  
- Offers four preset options for various grains: white rice, brown rice, quinoa, and steel-cut oats.  
- Ceramic nonstick coating is PFAS-free and designed for durability.  
- Compact size fits easily on kitchen counters or in storage.  
- Smart Grain technology adjusts for optimal cooking.  
- Dishwasher-safe components make cleanup effortless.  

**Limitations**  
- Ceramic bowl feels a bit fragile compared to other materials.  
- Requires precise measurement for consistent results.  
- Limited capacity (4 cups uncooked) may not be sufficient for larger households or gatherings.  

**Included Accessories**  
One thoughtful touch I liked was the inclusion of the spatula, ladle, and measuring cup. While these aren’t groundbreaking additions, they’re well-designed and genuinely useful additions to the package. The measuring cup provides accurate grain-to-water ratios, and the spatula does a great job of scooping rice without scraping the coating.

**Product Rivals**  
When considering alternatives, several other rice cookers stand out in this price range. The Zojirushi NS-TSC10 offers slightly larger capacity and a wide array of programmable settings, but it comes at a noticeably higher cost. Meanwhile, basic models from Aroma may lack the ceramic nonstick advantages and smart cooking options provided by this model, though they remain budget-friendly and larger in size. Comparing all of these, the GreenPan really shines with its compact footprint and health-focused nonstick coating, provided your household doesn't need to cook in bulk quantities often.

**Value for Money**  
Given its features like the fuzzy logic cooking, ceramic nonstick bowl, and solid reliability, this rice cooker balances affordability and performance quite well. While it's not the most feature-rich option available, it leans toward healthy and convenient cooking, which makes it worth every penny for daily users who value those qualities. In terms of cost-efficiency, you’d have to weigh whether its slightly smaller capacity meets your household's needs, but for small families or individuals, I’d say it's a smart investment.

She’s got a job and has rich, supportive, parents, so I wish she could support my studying. My family is completely broke, and I do understand that my Gf wants me to do more than buy one coffee for her every 3 weeks, but I am comfortable being broke, as long as it pays off 5-10 years down the line. Fact is, I’ve got one year left of school (free education), and I start applying to universities and colleges in a few months.

While I do study and love art, everything I do either works towards a strong portfolio or my CV. I study it more for the communication and networking skills it’s teaching me. If anything my biggest artwork was me taking on a managerial role. In the future I’m very much looking for white collar work. Also worth noting I spend about 10-15 hours a day (even holidays) studying and planning so I do work extremely hard for this.

After quite a few months of arguing with my girlfriend about me getting a job, my GFs father offered me a construction job from a family friend. I was happy at first, as I didn’t have to go out seeking for this opportunity, but when I talked about it with my mother she pointed out it feels like an insult in a way. What she said was that I train extremely hard for white collar work, so getting a (just above) minimum wage blue collar offer from someone this close to us feels disrespectful. While I’m not as opinionated as her, it did resonate with me quite  deeply. Art had always been seen as a “joke” career, so it isn’t unlikely.

The Road That Never Brought You Home

There was a time when the world was still peaceful, before the war, before the violence. During that time, our life was perfect, in a quiet and modest house in Bago City.

Our house wasn't large, but it was home. The rough stairs creaked whenever we stepped on them. The kitchen echoed with the sounds of pots and pans. Outside, the red car he had saved up for sat under a big and beautiful oak tree. In the backyard grew our vegetable garden, with flowers Elias and I planted ourselves.

I still remember how the radio played love songs in the late afternoon, and how we would sing along together without a care in the world. I remember the barking dogs that chased me down the road, and how he would throw hard stones at them. He hated ampalaya, but he still ate it when I cooked it. He loved sweet mangoes and would sneak some when he thought I wasn’t looking. Every weekend, we had fried fish with garlic rice and coffee, one of his favorite meals.

Elias wasn’t a soldier or a fighter. He was a mechanic. A kind and modest man. The man I wanted to marry.
We planned to have our wedding in April, 1942.

But the world waits for no one.
The war came early.
In December of 1941, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. By January, they were here.

He wasn’t drafted. He volunteered. He didn’t carry a rifle. He carried a toolbox.

He promised me he wouldn’t be on the front lines. Just fixing up broken vehicles, patching radios, and rigging supply lines. I knew Elias didn’t want to go. I saw the fear in his eyes.
But he also couldn’t stay, not when neighbors were disappearing and news of the war was growing louder every day.

The night before he left, he packed quietly. I gave him a necklace. It contained a picture of us, from a time when life was still happy. He pressed my hand to his chest, over his heart, and whispered,
""Remember, I’ll always come back home, to you. I promise.""
Those were the last words he ever spoke to me.

I watched as the truck that came to pick him up drove away, down the gravel road.

That road.
That cursed road.
It never brought him back.

At first, he wrote letters.

""The base is moving north.""
""I still have your necklace. I look at it every day.""
""Its hard to sleep without you, we don't even have soft pillows here""
""The nights are cold and lonely, but I’ll get through somehow.""
""Wait for me.""



And so, I waited.

The war ended. Japan surrendered. People cheered. Families wept as loved ones came back in rags, in coffins, or alive, scarred but breathing.

But Elias never came back.

I tried everything. I wrote to government offices. I visited military outposts. I asked every soldier I saw if they had known an Elias, a mechanic.
None had answers.

So, I waited.
And waited.

The world around me changed.

The red car that he cherished so much turned old and rusty.
The house with which we cared for began to crumble with time.
The garden stopped growing. I let it die.

Even I changed. My hair turned white, and my skin lined and wrinkled. But every August, on his birthday, I still set the table for two. Fried fish, garlic rice, and coffee. His chair always remained empty.

I never remarried.
Never loved another.
I stayed true to my one true love.

And every day, I looked out toward that gravel road.
Hoping, just maybe, he would keep his promise.
That someday, it would bring him back to me.

But it never did.

Oh and we had to use specific words so that's why there's sum stuff that's a lil weird, like ""ampalaya"" or ""we don't even have soft pillows here""",1,1754559197.0,writing,1,0.67,False

1mjvgl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mjvgl1/ghosts_visit_me_tonight/,Ghosts visit me tonight,"My name is Manuel. I've spent half my life in the construction business, although in a place like Almagro that means much more than laying bricks. Here, if you have money and know how to pull strings, you end up with more power than the mayor and the priest put together. And I have it.

When I was awarded the contract to restore the church of San Agustín, I knew it was a sure thing: a beautiful façade, subsidized work, and prestige. But everything went wrong the day my men lifted the floor of the central nave.

There, buried without a name, we found the remains of eighteen friars. Some in rotten coffins, others wrapped in old rags. All wearing black habits. Augustinians, no doubt. I counted them myself. Eighteen. Buried for more than two centuries, maybe more. Forgotten by everyone... except God, I suppose.

I knew what would happen if I reported it to the Heritage Department: work would be halted, inspections, endless paperwork. And I couldn't afford any delays. I had loans, interest payments, and suppliers who wouldn't wait. So I did what I thought was necessary.

I called the usual people. That same night, with no witnesses, we loaded the remains into a van and took them to the old cemetery. To a mass grave that no one visits. No names. No mass. No permission. We buried them like dogs. And we sealed the silence with a couple of bottles of whiskey and an envelope in the sacristy.

I thought that would be enough. That if you bury the past deep enough, it stays there.

But I was wrong.

The dead... don't forgive.

Since then, I've tried to get on with my life as if nothing had happened. But last night... something changed... They started coming.

It's ten o'clock at night when I get home. I'm exhausted from checking bills, crunching numbers, and looking for solutions that never come.

I've managed to balance the books—a miracle—and I've just sent them to the accountant. In the kitchen, I nibble at something without appetite. Then I turn on the television to see if tonight I'll be lucky and get a better night's sleep. The television talks to itself in a language I don't want to understand.

It oppresses me. I turn off the television. I just want to sleep. I pour myself two whiskies, Johnnie Walker Black Label, looking for a shortcut to oblivion. The first one hits me hard; the second one numbs me. The silence in the house doesn't calm me down: it seems to be waiting for something.

I go up to my bedroom. I feel that the darkness doesn't begin in the hallway , but inside me. As I step on the last step, I hear a creak that I don't like. I don't stop. I let myself fall onto the bed like an empty sack. Darkness envelops me. The alcohol drags me down.

I am awakened by banging. Dry. Direct. As if someone were hammering something into the wall. I look at the clock: it is three in the morning. The air is freezing. I feel that I am not alone. I sit up. I feel the hairs on my arms stand on end. There is something in the room. It is watching me.

The banging continues, now echoing from the hallway... no, from below.

The echo changes location as if playing with me. I think, “Who's the son of a bitch hammering at this hour?” But my inner voice sounds shaky. The banging stops. And then, a voice—masculine, deep, hollow—whispers my name:

“Manuel... Manuel...”

My name doesn't sound like it's in the air. It echoes inside me. Each syllable resonates in my chest as if I were being beaten from within, marking the beat of an ancient fear.

I get up. I don't think, I act. I go down the stairs barefoot, feeling the cold wood under my feet. The floor seems damp  cold, as if someone had walked on it with wet feet.

There is no wind, but the doors creak. There are no footsteps, but the floorboards groan.

I curse myself for not sleeping downstairs. When I arrive, the lights in the living room flicker. Then they go out. The switch doesn't respond. And then, a bluish, almost purple light floods the room. There is fog, thick and low, as if the house were breathing.

Now I'm petrified. A thick fear that paralyzes my stomach. The voice returns:

“Manuel... give me back my brothers...”

And it's not just one voice anymore. There are several. Men's voices, deep, choral, ancient. They confuse me.

I see a figure in the courtyard. Tall. Motionless. A monk dressed in black, with his hood up. He's watching me. He has no face, but he's looking at me. He's wearing a wet habit. Water is dripping... but there's no puddle. The air smells of damp, old cassocks and confinement.

“Where did you bury my brothers?”

I don't know if he said it... or if I heard it inside my head. Suddenly, the voices intone a chant in Latin. A lament:

*Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam...*

*Et secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum dele iniquitatem meam...*

The singing does not come from the hall. It vibrates within the walls. Inside me. It's a prayer. But it sounds like a condemnation.

I can't scream. The voice is stuck in my throat. I pull my hair. I pinch my arm. I'm not dreaming. This is real. The air is heavy. It smells of old dampness, of enclosed stone. The creaking of the floor mixes with the whispers. Something brushes against my ankle. There's nothing there.

I run up the stairs. I stumble. I fall. The impact wakes me up for a second. I get up limping, panting, without looking back.

“Leave me alone! I beg you!”

The voices don't stop. The blows continue, dry, distant. A phrase haunts me:

“We won't rest until you pay...”

I throw myself onto the bed and cover myself with the blanket like a child. It's as if I've been put in an open coffin and covered with blankets. I press the pillow against my ears. I'm shaking. Only then do I understand why children believe that blankets scare away monsters.

I feel something at the edge of the bed. A presence. Dense. Silent.

I know they're there, even though I can't see them. Even though they're not breathing.

I don't dare look. I don't know if I've just seen the dead... or if it's my own conscience cast in shadow. The only things that are certain are the cold sweat, the trembling in my hands, and that emptiness inside me that nothing can fill. I stay like that, motionless, until the light of dawn dissolves the horror.

I wake up. It's past noon. I never sleep that long. Everything is strangely calm, as if nothing had happened. Everything smells clean, but not like home. As if someone had wanted to erase what had happened. I feel relaxed, light. I'd like to think it was just a nightmare. I walk down the hall. The living room. The patio. Everything is in its place. There's no fog. No strange lights. No sign of the monk. I convince myself that it was all a bad dream.

I go to the kitchen. I make myself a coffee with milk and some doughnuts. I love how the sugar melts in the coffee. But when I dip one in, I see my left hand: red marks, like pecking. The marks on my hand no longer hurt. But they are there. Like silent witnesses.

Then I remember. I pinched myself. I pulled my hair out. I threw myself on the floor.

It wasn't a dream.

All my energy is suddenly drained. As if someone had unplugged my soul. I stare at my coffee without tasting it. I don't finish the doughnuts. I leave the house.

I don't know if I'm running away or if someone is chasing me.

But as I walk down the empty street, with the taste of fear still in my throat, I feel them following me.

I don't hear them. I don't see them.

The Process:

I’ll work for 2 full months applying to roles tailored to you.

If interviews are scheduled, great! My job continues until the end of two months. I won't stop with one interview; you can attend as many interviews as you get.

Clearing interviews is up to you — I can’t help with that part.

If you don’t get a single interview call in 2 months, consider the entire thing free.

If you do get interview calls, I’ll charge a small success fee after 60 days.


Why a ₹2000 Fee?

It’s 100% refundable after 2 months — whether or not you land an interview.
This is just to ensure you don’t ghost mid-way and my efforts don’t go to waste.

You only pay my small service charge later if you get interview invites or a job. Yeah, it's a small-time charge for my service. I hope you pay for it! 


TL;DR:

You do zero job hunting. I do everything for 2 months.
₹2000 is a refundable commitment deposit.
If no interviews → you pay nothing.
If you get interviews → small fee after 60 days.
If you get selected and get a job - a little bit charge and a cup of coffee.

I’ve been getting a lot of messages lately and I’m really sorry I couldn’t respond earlier. I definitely don’t want to miss your chat or delay things further.

1mjve1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mjve1m/i_tried_to_buy_a_tapeworm_using_my_parents_credit/,I tried to buy a tapeworm using my parents’ credit card,"This happened back when I was in high school, a few years ago now. I was, and continue to be, anorexic (subtype restrictive, if anyone cares) and I was desperate to lose weight. By any means possible and I really mean *any*. I didn’t eat breakfast, I threw out my lunches and I tried to purge my dinner whenever possible. I lived off black coffee, gatorade zero, diet coke and as little food as humanly possible and I was losing weight. But not fast enough.



Hour by hour comparatively, I researched weight loss, diets and eating disorders more than any subject in school. I’m a veritable fountain of knowledge on all the ways to look like a fashionable corpse. This research led me to hard drugs like heroin and cocaine but I was raised on enough Hole and Amy Winehouse to be wary of those. But it also led me to diet pills, like ephedrine, phentermine and tapeworm pills. Not tapeworm killing pills, not antiparasitics but pills containing tapeworm eggs that are supposed to hatch inside your intestine and eat all your food before you can digest it. Appetite suppressants are all well and good but to be able to eat whatever I want, as much as I want and still lose weight? A frightening amount of weight? That was my teenage dream.



So yeah. I was going to steal my mother’s credit card and spend a hundred dollars giving myself an intestinal parasite. It was embarrassing and gross to think about for too long but I convinced myself that it was going to be fine. That it would come with a pill to kill the tapeworm once I lost enough weight and everything would be totally fine. So late one night, I snuck into my mother’s office with her credit card and found the very sketchy website selling appetite suppressants and tapeworms. Everything was going great until my sister walked in on me and asked me what I was doing, which led to a very awkward and hushed conversation. I insisted that I wasn’t doing anything wrong but my sister refused to believe me and refused to leave the room until I put Mom’s credit card back. Because I was worried about waking our parents, I begrudgingly put the credit card back and vowed to do it another night.



Unfortunately, the next morning my mother’s computer had mysteriously gotten a virus and that was the end of my access to it. She never figured out where it came from or what I was trying to do, but my mother was right in guessing that the virus was my fault. So… sorry about the computer, Mom. That one was my bad :-/

## Key Features Analysis

The best 8 oz plastic cups offer a combination of durability,safety,and convenience.

**Material Composition:** High-quality 8 oz plastic cups are often made from polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Polypropylene offers good heat resistance and is commonly used for hot beverages,while PET is highly transparent and suitable for cold drinks and displays.

The choice of material greatly impacts the cup's durability, clarity, and suitability for different applications. Food-grade plastics, free from BPA and phthalates, are essential for safety. The thickness of the plastic also contributes to its sturdiness and resistance to cracking or bending.

**Cup Dimensions and Design:** Precise dimensions are crucial for consistent portioning and compatibility with dispensing systems. Standard 8 oz cups typically measure around 3.75 inches in height and 3 inches in diameter at the top.A sturdy base is essential to prevent tipping, especially when the cup is filled with liquid. Some cups feature a slightly tapered design for easier stacking and separation, reducing storage space and improving hygiene. Ribbed or textured surfaces can enhance grip and prevent slippage.

**Rim Design and Sealing:** A smooth, rolled rim enhances drinking comfort and reduces the risk of spills. A well-designed rim is essential for compatibility with lids,allowing for a secure seal to prevent leaks during transport.

Lid compatibility is crucial for takeout orders and events where drinks need to be transported. Look for cups that are compatible with a variety of lid types, including flat lids, dome lids, and straw-slotted lids. A tight seal also helps maintain the temperature of hot or cold beverages.

**Stackability and Dispensing:** Easy stackability is essential for efficient storage and dispensing. Cups that stack neatly and separate easily reduce clutter and improve hygiene.

Some cups are designed for use with automatic dispensing machines, requiring specific dimensions and rim designs to ensure proper functionality.Dispenser compatibility is a critical consideration for businesses that serve large volumes of beverages. The ease of separating cups from a stack is also critically important, as stuck together cups can lead to frustration and wasted time.

**Environmental Considerations:** Eco-conscious consumers are increasingly seeking sustainable alternatives to customary plastic cups. Options include recyclable PET cups and compostable cups made from plant-based materials like PLA.

Recyclable cups can reduce environmental impact if properly disposed of in designated recycling bins. Compostable cups offer a more sustainable solution, breaking down naturally in commercial composting facilities.Look for certifications like BPI compostability to ensure that the cups meet industry standards for biodegradation. The use of recycled content in the manufacturing process is another factor to consider.

**How should I store 8 oz plastic cups?**

Store 8 oz plastic cups in a clean, dry place to prevent contamination and maintain their hygiene. Keep them away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures, which can damage the plastic.

1mjvbar,https://v.redd.it/go2e84tgekhf1,Money Stories Shape Financial Habits,"How childhood money beliefs shape your financial future 💰 This podcast episode explores the deep connection between early experiences and adult spending behaviours through Matt's powerful Australian story.

🧠 The Psychology Behind Your Money Decisions

Matt's journey reveals how financial psychology starts in childhood. From being told his family was ""broke"" at age four to learning that money ""burns a hole in his pocket,"" these money scripts became unconscious drivers of his adult financial behaviour. The conversation highlights how money mindset programming occurs through family messages, cultural influences, and early experiences that create lasting financial trauma patterns.

💸 From Disposable to Discretionary Thinking

The discussion explores Matt's transformation from viewing leftover money as ""disposable income"" to understanding it as ""discretionary income."" This shift in money programming demonstrates how language itself influences spending habits and wealth psychology. Matt shares how recognising these inherited money blocks helped him break free from generational wealth patterns that kept him financially stuck.

📈 Practical Solutions for Financial Healing

Matt's twenties brought harsh financial lessons, living paycheck to paycheck on $34,000 with poor cash flow management. Through hitting financial ""brick walls,"" he developed practical systems: calendar reminders for bill timing, the 50/30/20 budgeting approach, and strategic payment planning. These tools transformed his relationship with money from reactive to intentional, proving that financial therapy principles can create lasting change.

🌟 Breaking Generational Money Patterns

This episode emphasises that whilst money anxiety and financial trauma run deep through families and culture, they're not permanent. Through conscious awareness of your money scripts, strategic financial planning, and challenging inherited beliefs, you can rewrite your financial story. The podcast offers hope that financial literacy combined with understanding money blocks can lead to genuine financial healing.

1mjvb1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_offpageyugtechnology/comments/1mjvb1s/the_secret_rooftops_of_udaipur_sunset_views/,The Secret Rooftops of Udaipur: Sunset Views Without the Crowds,"Udaipur is known as the **“City of Lakes”**, but when the sun begins to dip behind the Aravalli Hills, it transforms into a **city of golden skies**. While popular spots like **Ambrai Ghat** or **Karni Mata Temple** attract large sunset crowds, there’s a quieter, more atmospheric way to soak in the view—**from the city’s secret rooftops**.

Whether you’re looking for romance, reflection, or photography, these **lesser-known rooftop spots** offer unfiltered beauty without the bustle.

# Why Rooftop Sunsets Are Special in Udaipur

Udaipur’s traditional architecture, with its intricate havelis and open terraces, naturally lends itself to **panoramic rooftop experiences**. As the light softens, the palaces glow like gold, pigeons take flight, and the lakes mirror the sky.

The best part? You don’t need to jostle with crowds—just choose the right rooftop, order some chai, and let the evening work its magic.

# 1. Jaiwana Haveli Rooftop (Old City)

This charming guesthouse is quietly tucked near **Lake Pichola** and offers a rooftop restaurant with an uninterrupted view of the **City Palace and Jag Mandir**. It’s lesser known than its fancy neighbors but just as rewarding.

**Tip:** Arrive early and grab a spot at the corner table for the best angle.

# 2. Natural View Restaurant (Near Gangaur Ghat)

With no flashy signage and a simple entrance, **Natural View** lives up to its name. It’s often frequented by backpackers and offbeat travelers who swear by its calm atmosphere and surprisingly good food.

**Best For:** Watching the sunset behind the Lake Palace, with minimal noise and maximum charm.

# 3. Café Edelweiss Terrace (Hidden Gem)

Not many know that **Café Edelweiss**, popular for coffee and croissants, has a **semi-private terrace upstairs**. It’s not the tallest rooftop but offers a cozy view of city life with a backdrop of the hills.

**Pro Tip:** Pair your view with their almond cake and a hot espresso.

# 4. Neem Tree Rooftop Café (Ambrai Road)

While Ambrai Ghat is often packed at sunset, this nearby **Neem Tree rooftop café** gives you the same lakefront view without the selfie-stick chaos. It’s perfect for photographers and introverts alike.

**Ideal For:** A peaceful solo sunset with a sketchpad or journal in hand.

# 5. Udai Niwas Rooftop (Budget-Friendly & Beautiful)

This unpretentious rooftop restaurant offers 360-degree views of the **Old City, the Lake Palace**, and **Monsoon Palace in the distance**. Despite its affordability, it delivers a premium sunset experience—especially when the sky turns pink and orange.

**Try:** Their lemon ginger tea at golden hour—it hits differently up here.

# Travel Tip: Use a One Way Taxi Service in Udaipur

Most of these rooftops are located in the **Old City**, which has **narrow alleys and limited parking**. Instead of navigating the maze yourself, it’s wise to book a [**one way taxi service in Udaipur**](https://nakodaonewaytaxi.com/).

**Nakoda One Way Taxi** provides timely drop-offs and pickups from your hotel or rooftop venue, ensuring you don’t miss golden hour due to delays or traffic. It’s convenient, affordable, and hassle-free.

# Rooftop Sunset Etiquette

* **Arrive 30–45 minutes before sunset** to get a good seat
* Don’t play loud music or disturb others—sunset is sacred here
* **Tip the café staff**—you’re not just buying food, you’re buying a view
* Respect any photography rules, especially in heritage buildings
* Bring a light jacket—the breeze gets cooler after sunset

# Final Thoughts

Udaipur’s best views aren’t found in crowded hotspots—they’re hidden in plain sight, waiting on rooftops above chai stalls and guesthouses. As the sun sinks behind the palaces and the city lights begin to twinkle, you’ll realize that the best sunsets are the quiet ones.

So next time you’re in Udaipur, **look up**, find a hidden rooftop, and let the city show you its softer side—away from the crowd, closer to the clouds.",1,1754558299.0,u_offpageyugtechnology,0,1.0,False
1mjvaym,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mjvaym/aitah_for_not_enjoying_unplanned_visits_at_my/,AITAH for not enjoying unplanned visits at my parents' house?,"I (M27) am spending a few weeks at my parents house for summer. I have a pretty good relationship with them, honestly, but one thing that bothers me are unplanned visits from almost-strangers. My mother would see someone she barely knows strolling by and saying hi to her, so she proceeds to literally force them into coming inside for a cup of coffee or a soda. The majority of people mostly accept out of kindness, not wanting to be rude and refuse (at least the first time that is). I know, ""it's not your home so your parents are allowed to do whatever they want and invite whoever they like"", and I perfectly agree with that. 

The problem is that one of the house ""unwritten rules"" is that I have to introduce myself to every single person that enters and leaves, having to sit down with my mother and take part in her ice-breaking technique: she starts off telling embarrassing stories of me to make others laugh and then, once the defence is lowered, trauma-dump them with her personal problems.

Yesterday it was a crazy afternoon. I was tending to a plant in the porch and having a quiet, relaxing moment for myself when one of my brother's old childhood friends passed by with his daughters. I waved politely. My ma' stormed outside with the most extroverted behaviour and forced them to come inside and have something to drink. This man, with my ma's consensus, let these children _take off their shoes and run around the house like maniacs_. I was shit scared one of them might fall down and hurt themselves in the living room, maybe fall onto the glass coffee table and who knows. I also had to rush to clean up certain rooms of the house since my ma' had the brilliant idea to play sales agent and show this almost-strangers neighbor the entirety of our house, my old room included for some reason.

After the visit, I talked to her. I told her that yeah, I'm introvert and she's an extrovert, I get she likes to welcome people in without giving notice, and that I try my best to be ok with that since ""her house her rules"", but how the hell is it okay to show every stranger my room with my personal stuff inside? Plus, them kids could've gotten themselves hurt on our property by running around everywhere. She dismissed my concerns saying that I'm just like my grandma, asocial and awkward.

1mjv8gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mjv8gx/i_saw_the_aurora_borealis_and_lost_control_of_my/,I saw the Aurora Borealis and lost control of my shadow,"I wasn’t expecting to see it. The aurora, I mean.

 

This far south, we’re supposed to get clouds, not curtains of color. But there it was, at 2:12 a.m., washing through the sky like a tide of bruises, bands of green and violet folding in on themselves, pulsing like a beautiful cosmic breath. I stood by the kitchen window, coffee in hand, barefoot on cold tile. No sound, of course. That kind of beauty arrives on mute.

 

I set up the tripod half out of instinct. Film it, capture it, study it later. I’ve always trusted cameras more than eyes. Lenses don’t overthink or analyse. They just see.

 

The footage turned out surprisingly clear. I scrubbed through it twice, expecting static, lens flares, something to cheapen the awe. But it was clean. The colors moved in layers, waves rising through other waves, too slow to be wind, too fluid to be digital noise.

 

I kept watching longer than I meant to. There was something calming about it, like a slow exhale stretched across the night. Not majestic, exactly. Just… kind of reassuring.

 

At the four-minute mark, I caught my own reflection in the window, coffee raised, standing perfectly still. It startled me for a second, the way reflections sometimes do when your mind lags behind your body. I hadn’t realized how still I’d become. I looked like part of the furniture.

 

I laughed at myself, just a quiet smirk expressed through the nose, and let the video play out.

 

Eventually, the colors faded. The sky turned back to black. I shut off the camera, closed the blinds, and went back to bed, thinking I’d dream in shades of green.

 

The problem started three days later.

 

I was brushing my teeth, leaning on the sink with one hand, staring at nothing in particular. The overhead light buzzed a little, like it always did when the weather turned humid. A soft stutter, not even a full blink, just a flutter of dimness that passed as quickly as it came.

 

I didn’t think much of it. The fixture’s old. I’ve replaced the bulbs twice in the past year, and the wiring in this building was probably done in the seventies, blindfolded, and hungover.

 

Still, I paused. Rinsed. Looked up.

 

In the mirror, for half a second, I thought I saw myself move out of sync.

 

It wasn’t dramatic. Just a hesitation. My shoulder lowered half a breath late. A blink that lingered just slightly longer in the reflection. I caught myself making faces, like a kid checking his expressions in the mirror. I figured it was a delay in perception, maybe. Like when the connection hiccups and you catch yourself off-beat in that little vanity window during an online video call. Either that or simple, home-grown tiredness. I’d been editing video that day, which doesn’t help. Four hours spent frame-cutting corporate testimonials, watching the same forced laugh on repeat until it stops meaning anything. Brains skip like records when we’re tired.

 

Then, the next evening, it happened again. This time, while I was walking past the hallway, the light coming in sideways from the west-facing window, I caught the edge of my shadow on the floor – just the outline of my arm – and it seemed to lag behind my step, like it hadn’t gotten the cue in time.

 

Again, it was subtle, but blatant enough to make me stop and back up a step. I stepped forward again. This time, the shadow kept up. Smooth, natural.

 

Probably just the angle of the light. Or maybe the floorboards dipping slightly. Old buildings do that. Uneven surfaces play tricks. I even considered digging out the level from the toolbox in the closet, just to prove a point to no one in particular.

 

I didn’t. I made tea instead.

 

As I stirred the honey in, I glanced down and caught my shadow reaching for the spoon. Nothing strange about that.

 

But this time I kept watching. Just long enough to be sure it moved when I did.

 

I told myself I would shrug it off. Nothing worth mentioning, not to friends as a passing comment. Not even to myself in my own head. Maybe all that self-imposed screen time was getting to me.

 

But that night, before bed, I rewatched the aurora footage again – the sky breathing in color, slow and sure.

 

**\* \* \***

 

The next day, I decided to test it. Not seriously, not like a scientist or a ghost hunter. Just enough to scratch the itch, to shut down whatever my brain had started chewing on. If something looks wrong in a mirror, you change the angle. You disprove it to yourself and forget about it.

 

I set up a tripod in the living room, pointing at the blank wall where the light hits best midafternoon. One floor lamp behind me, soft and diffuse. Nothing dramatic. I just wanted to see how my shadow looked when I moved.

 

At first, I kept it simple: lifting my arms, turning my head, pacing in a small circle. Watching the shadows play. It was almost soothing. Like returning to some childhood version of myself, making animal shapes on bedroom walls.

 

I filmed the session on my phone, letting it run for five minutes, then sitting down to review.

 

Everything looked normal at first.

 

Then, halfway through, around the three-minute mark, I saw it.

 

It happened during a simple movement. I raised my left hand to scratch the back of my neck. On the wall, my shadow’s hand had reached the same spot a fraction before mine did.

 

Not after. Not at the same time. Before.

 

Hardly a handful of frames, barely noticeable unless you’re looking for it. But once you see it, it jumps out at you at every pass. I went back and forth over the same two-second clip a dozen times, each time more certain.

 

“I see you,” I muttered to myself.

 

I checked the playback speed, the framerate. Maybe the file had stuttered, maybe there was a lag in rendering. I transferred it to my laptop, played it frame by frame. The shadow always moved first.

 

I had a strange, dissonant sensation, as if nature had quietly reversed the choreography.

 

I stood up and repeated the motion in the same light. Everything looked normal. My shadow followed my every action, clean and smooth. Still, I recorded again.

 

This time, everything stayed in sync.

 

I went back to the original video and paused at the exact frame where the shadow began to move, took a screenshot and printed it. I taped it to the wall above my desk, between a sketch of a houseplant I never bought and a calendar from two years ago I keep forgetting to replace.

 

**\* \* \***

 

That night, I dreamt of moving through a corridor of mirrors. Every one of the images moved half a second ahead of me. So when I got up in the morning, I started rearranging the mirrors.

 

Not dramatically, no superstitions, no salt lines or post-it notes scribbled with prayers, just small adjustments. Tilting the hallway mirror a little left, repositioning the one by the coat rack to catch the edge of the kitchen. Watching how light moved through the apartment at different times of day. I was studying the space, reclaiming it – not inviting anything in.

 

It became part of the routine. After morning coffee: test the mirrors. Take a few slow steps, wave an arm, turn my head. Confirm that everything was still behaving the way it should.

 

Most times, my little ritual offered quiet reassurance. It became a kind of silent liturgy, repeated for the comfort of its pattern. But repetition breeds its own kind of blindness, and something always seems to lie in wait for the moment you stop expecting change.

 

It was late afternoon, sun hitting at a clean angle through the western window. I walked past the hallway mirror like I always did, pausing just long enough to catch my reflection in the frame.

 

The shadow behind me, cast long and soft across the far wall, moved differently.

 

Not faster or slower. Not a warped imitation, but something uncoupled from me entirely. It moved of its own accord.

 

In the mirror, I stood still. I know I did. I had paused to examine a small scratch on my forearm, absently running my thumb over it. My shadow shifted, very slightly, like it was adjusting its stance.

 

I turned quickly. It wasn’t panic, just that quiet insistence of instinct, like tugging at a thread you didn’t know was loose. Behind me, everything was as it should be: the familiar wall, the afternoon light, and my shadow, long and still, stretching calmly across the floor.

 

I stood there longer than I care to admit, watching the light bend around furniture. Waiting for the next misstep.

 

The shadow held still, polite, obedient.

 

I went to the kitchen for a drink, trying not to grip the glass too tightly.

 

**\* \* \***

 

I told myself I wouldn’t search for it.

 

Not because I thought it was absurd—though perhaps some part of me did—but because naming things gives them shape. And once something has shape, it can move. It can reach. I suppose I was trying to keep it unformed, still smudged at the edges.

 

But no one ever defeated the Devil by pretending he wasn’t there.

 

That night, with every lamp burning and my back pressed to the hallway wall, I gave in. It was a quiet surrender, like a door swinging open on its own, long after you'd forgotten you left it unlatched.

 

The phrase I typed into the search bar wasn’t elegant.

 

“shadow moves before me aurora no AI?”

 

Mostly weather blogs. A few local news outlets had covered the aurora in brief writeups about solar flares and magnetic anomalies. Nearly all of them thought they were clever for riffing on Principal Skinner from the Simpsons: “Aurora Borealis? At this time of year? At this time of day? Localized entirely over Chittenden County?”

 

The rest was amateur footage: glowing skies above empty fields, flickering greens and purples stitched together with grainy royalty-free music and titles like Midnight Miracle or Vermont Veil. I scrolled through twenty minutes of nothing until I finally stumbled across a thread.

 

“Shadow Discrepancy After Aurora? Help.”

 

It was buried on a forum I hadn’t thought about in years, one of those old message boards still clinging to static HTML and broken avatars. No upvotes. No timestamps. The handful of replies were all replaced with the same phrase: “This comment has been deleted.”

 

The original post was short:

 

“Noticed lag in shadows after the aurora last week. Started happening a few days after the fact. Something off with reflections, too. Anyone else? Not sleep paralysis, my eyes are fine.”

 

I clicked the username. The account was barely a week old with only a handful of posts scattered across boards about oneirology and Gestalt perception. One long comment about the limits of optical illusions.

 

Out of curiosity, I sent them a message. Just a line or two.

 

“I’ve noticed something similar. Noticed it before finding your post. What did you mean by ‘something off with reflections’?”

 

I didn’t expect a reply, but they answered within the hour.

 

“Don’t copy it. Don’t record it. They’re pattern-based. The act of observation gives them shape. Playback strengthens. Each repetition sharpens the copy. If it anticipates, it’s learning. If it deviates, it’s close. They’re like a palimpsest for the soul.”

 

I read the message three times. Then once more aloud. It didn’t help.

 

I typed back:

 

“What do you mean ‘they’? Are you saying this has happened before?”

 

No response. When I checked again the next morning, the account was gone. Deleted. No record of the thread, either—just a 404 error where it had been.

 

I wanted to believe it was someone trolling. A joke. Some deep-cut in-joke from a digital ghost town. But something about the message had an aftertaste of truth. Not the content so much, but the cadence.

 

I couldn’t stop thinking about the wording.

 

“Playback strengthens.”

 

I’d watched that clip of my shadow dozens of times. Studied it frame by frame. Paused it, zoomed in, printed stills and pinned them to the wall like evidence in a case I wasn’t sure I wanted to solve.

 

I had let it run in the background while making dinner, folding laundry, half-listening to podcasts I couldn't recall afterward.

 

A loop.

 

A feedback loop.

 

If it was learning, then what had I been teaching it?

 

**\* \* \***

 

Next day, the weather broke without warning.

 

There was no thunder at first. Just a steady hum and a shift in atmospheric pressure, the kind you feel more in your ribs than your ears. Then came the sharp, directional kind of wind  that paws at the windows like it’s begging to come in.

 

I was still awake, of course. Hadn’t really slept since the mirror thing.

 

The power went out around midnight with a clean flick. In an instant, the lights were gone, the refrigerator kicked off, and my laptop screen dimmed mid-keystroke. The silence was dense.

 

I sat there motionless, as if stillness could fool the dark into thinking I wasn’t there. Thought thinned into vapor. Somewhere behind my eyes, an idea curled and coiled with an insistent inward motion. The darkness didn’t surround me. It inverted around me, like I was seated not in a room, but in the pupil of some vast and sleeping eye.

 

I lit a single candle on the kitchen table. Beeswax, short wick, good for emergencies. The flame was steady but warm, throwing long shapes across the room.

 

The candlelight made everything feel soft and old. The way movies try to recreate the feeling of memory. I stared at the wall as my shadow lengthened and shifted with each flicker. It moved as I did, the way it always had. Or used to.

 

I reached out to adjust the wick. The shadow flinched.

 

A shudder through the arm, like it was bracing, expecting something like pain or a rebuke.

 

I froze. Left my hand hovering over the flame.

 

The shadow stayed like that, one miniscule step ahead. Like a dancer waiting for me to catch up.

 

I pulled my hand back slowly. The shadow didn’t follow, not immediately. It stood there, arm still extended.

 

Against my better judgment, I blew out the candle.

 

In the pitch dark, I could feel its shape with some deeper faculty older than skin or sense. Whatever it was, it wasn’t beside me so much as layered around and through me, interwoven almost into my spinal column, radiating softly outward.

 

Then came the wordless sound, like cloth dragging over a rough surface.

 

I reached slowly for my phone on the table, fingers fumbling in the thick air. The glow stuttered on – weak, low-battery dim – but enough to throw light.

 

It should have cast something, but the floor remained blank. Untouched. The pool of light sat undisturbed, a perfect disc, pale and depthless.

 

I passed my hand over it.

 

Nothing.

 

No outline. No distortion. No shadow.

 

My stomach turned in slow, icy motion. Not fear, exactly, but a deep, biological rejection.

 

Of everything strange these past days, this – this was the first thing that felt unnatural on a primally offensive level.

 

I told myself maybe the light wasn’t strong enough. That made sense, right?

 

Try the flashlight.

 

The stronger beam didn’t reveal anything – it only sharpened the absence. The floor glared under the flashlight, texture made stark by the angled light, but my shadow was nowhere in it.

 

Maybe my mind was trying to ground what I was seeing into whatever logic it could find, however tenuous, and I had a strange association in that moment. It reminded me of Lahaina Noon. The zero-shadow moment in Hawaii, when the sun’s rays fall exactly vertical relative to an object on the ground. It happens a couple of times a year, and the photographs always make reality look like poorly rendered computer graphics or an Alex Colville painting.

 

I didn’t like it at all. I moved the flashlight slowly, sweeping it across the floor, the wall, the table legs. Maybe it was the surface – some strange matte quality scattering the light, preventing the shadow from forming. Is that even possible?

 

That’s when I caught something. A shape too familiar to be ignored. So familiar that a wave of horror seared through my brain at the realization that it wasn’t where it was supposed to be.

 

It was standing against the wall. My shadow, on the other side of the room, completely detached from its anchor – from me. The shape was wrong in all the wrong ways: one shoulder raised too high, the neck a little too long, the proportions just shy of natural. It was a good enough replica to be instantly recognizable as mine, but at the same time different enough to make me feel as if I’d been hurled head-first into the deepest part of Uncanny Valley.

 

The sensation was total. A full-body flash of instinctual rejection, as if I’d stumbled upon my own grave and found myself already in it.

 

The aversion was powerful enough to override common sense, and I turned out the light.

 

Not a moment had passed before I heard the words whispered directly into my ear, pronounced with the precision of profound effort:

 

“I… see… you…”

 

My mouth hadn’t moved. I hadn’t spoken. But the voice had shape, tone, timbre. It was mine.

 

I sat down on the floor. Hugged my knees like a child and tried as hard as I could to ignore the panicked rhythm beside me. A second chest rising in time to my own.

 

I didn’t sleep, I didn’t move. I just listened until the sun returned.

 

**\* \* \***

 

I spent the next day covering the windows. Every one of them – the narrow bathroom slit, the warped kitchen pane, the old bay in the living room where the sunset used to pool. I taped blankets over the glass, tucked towels into the corners, stacked books against the gaps where light tried to sneak through.

 

No more sun. No more silhouettes.

 

I unplugged the overheads too. Every bulb. Every lamp. Even the LED strips behind the monitor. Anything that could cast even the suggestion of a shadow.

 

The space took on the weight of a sealed box. Stale and pressurized. Time no longer moved by light but by the slow rhythm of my breath.

 

For illumination, I allowed only red – a low emergency bulb from a camping kit. Just dim enough not to cast a shadow strong enough to congeal.

 

I drifted from room to room like a blind swimmer, brushing fingertips against the walls, speaking aloud just to anchor myself in sound.

 

“I’m here,” I said once.

 

Then again. Quieter.

 

“I’m here.”

 

I told myself it was about control, that I was cutting off its avenue, starving it. Shadows need contrast. No light, no dark. No figure, no form.

 

But the truth was simpler. I was scared to see what it would do next.

 

The playback, that goddamn two-second clip, remained frozen on my laptop screen. I hadn’t closed it. But I hadn’t pressed play either.

 

Still, I could hear it. Not the sound itself, but the shape of it. The rhythm of it looping quietly at the base of my skull.

 

I started whispering to drown it out.

 

“I am here. I am here. I am here.”

 

I recorded it, made a ritual of it. A tether.

 

When I played it back, the whisper came through clearly.

 

“I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here.”

 

Four times. Not three.

 

I checked the waveform. No glitch. No edit. No gap. Just my voice. Whispering one more time than I remembered.

 

I didn’t want to look at the video clip again, but after three days of red light and silence, I gave in.

 

Maybe I needed to check if it had stopped. If the footage had changed back. If I could undo whatever I’d started.

 

The file was still open, paused on a single frame showing my shadow, its hand raised just before mine.

 

I pressed play.

 

There I was, weeks earlier, pacing in front of the wall like some awkward magician. Scratching the back of my neck. Yawning.

 

I moved, and the shadow moved first. Just as before.

 

Then it tilted its head.

 

The movement was almost bird-like. As quick as it was inquisitive.

 

I watched it again and again, pausing at the tilt to study it.

 

It wasn’t a trick of the light. Not pareidolia. Not compression artifacts.

 

It was deliberate.

 

It was the kind of tilt someone gives when they’re wondering why you’re still here.

 

**\* \* \***

 

I stood after I don’t know how long and walked to the bathroom. I replaced the overhead bulb and switched on overhead light, watching the shadows bloom.

 

My reflection looked back. Tired eyes, hollow cheeks. All mine.

 

The shadow on the wall behind me lingered a fraction too long when I leaned forward. It caught up eventually. It always does.

 

**\* \* \***

 

I stopped moving. That was the only solution left. No more pacing the hall. No more testing mirrors. No more self to trace. Stillness would keep me whole.

 

So I sat cross-legged on the living room floor, back to the wall. No windows. No light. No shadow.

 

I stayed like that until time softened. At some point, I even stopped needing to blink. The dark became gentle and warm. Only quietness and form.

 

It knew my movements now. It had watched enough, learned enough.

 

I am not what I was, exactly. But I am still here, and I wear the shape well. The flesh folds neatly, the limbs align. The voice works beautifully now – the sound is entirely clean. I walk the apartment with perfect familiarity, as if all this has always been mine.

Unfortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to visit other cities, so I stayed in Yerevan.
I used to spend some of my time in a coffee shop called « Lumen Coffee », very cozy, a good place if you are a student/business owner,  or looking for very calm atmosphere.

I used to workout in an outdoor gym, I forgot the place’s name, but it’s on a hill, and I also met a lot of people there including the owner, a very kind person who’s offering free outdoor gym to everyone.

I don’t want to wake up to another morning of her not being here, not when I can just stay awake and keep going. I’ll drink coffee or energy drinks to stay up as long as possible. Going as far as pushing at least 48 hours of being awake. 

It feels like I’ve lost such a massive part of myself with her. I’ve changed in a decent amount of ways, I’m definitely not the person I was before. Part of me is still somewhat in denial that she’s even gone, even though her urn sits right across from my bed.

Everything ran pretty smoothly with maybe one or two slight adjustments I’d make. We got lucky with mostly 28C+ weather throughout and traffic was never too bad.
For context we’re a mid 30s foodie couple. I’m from the UK originally and my wife is Canadian, and we’ve travelled a fair bit around Europe before including Italy multiple times. TLDR at the bottom because this is a long one.

We flew from Toronto into Rome on an overnight flight leaving on July 28, landed around 10am on the 29th, and rented a car. Drove all the way down to Praiano using the toll roads which made things really straightforward. Once in Praiano, we parked the car and used public transport for the next couple of days.

Day 1 - 29th July
Running on zero sleep, we took the bus into Positano which was a quick and easy 15 minute journey and saved the hassle of finding parking. Positano is beautiful, definitely busier than Praiano, but had a nice energy. As expected, be prepared for steps and hills. That evening, we kept it light with snacks and cocktails at Cafe Mirante, a great little bar with sea views that was recommended to me on this sub.

Day 2 - 30th July
We took the morning slow and hit a beach club in Praiano. Loved the vibe but it was pricier than others we saw later in the trip. The walk down was fine, but the way back up was a workout. In the evening we headed back to Positano for dinner and I had the best seafood gnocchi of my life. Drooling thinking about it.

Day 3 - 31st July
Packed up early and drove to our hotel just outside Sorrento. Parking was free and we caught the local bus into the centre for 2 euro each. Super easy and drops you right near the action. Sorrento felt more touristy, geared around excursions and shops, but we still enjoyed wandering the streets, picking up souvenirs, eating a ridiculous focaccia sandwich, and trying the lemon sorbet served inside a lemon. Went back to the hotel for a break and then back into town for dinner. Public transport really does take the pressure off.

Day 4 - 1st August
Started the morning with a cooking class where we learned how to make ravioli, eggplant parmigiana, and lemon tiramisu. Easily the best experience we booked thanks to the Chef teaching us. Later we chilled at the hotel rooftop pool to catch some sun, and then in the evening did a sunset cruise. It was €100 per person for a shared group of up to 12, but we ended up being the only ones on board. The sea was a bit choppy but the captain seemed unfazed and the sunset was unreal*.

Day 5 - 2nd August
We left for Ravello and instantly felt the shift in pace. Ravello ended up being one of our favourite places. It has a Tuscan village vibe with stunning views and a slower rhythm. We wandered through the gardens, got gelato, people watched, and finished the day with pizza at Mimi Pizzeria. Easily top five pizzas of my life.I will be dreaming about this pizza, oh my gosh the pizza 🤤

Day 6 - 3rd August
Woke up early and grabbed coffee and a croissant in the square before heading to Villa Cimbrone right when it opened. Much quieter! After wandering the gardens, we took a shuttle down to Amalfi. Walked the streets, went into the Duomo, grabbed seafood cones and decided to walk the coast to Atrani. It took around 15 minutes and led us to a quieter beach. We rented sun beds for 20 euro each which included umbrellas. We could have stayed until closing, but we wanted to head back up to Ravello for dinner so after a couple dips in the sea we made our way back.

Day 7 - 4th August
This one took a bit of planning. We were heading to Procida and originally thought we’d catch the ferry from Sorrento but logistically it made no sense. We ended up driving to Naples, parked at the marina, and caught the hydrofoil over which took about 40 minutes. We looked at Capri and Ischia but honestly we prefer places with more of a chill vibe when we can get it. Procida did not disappoint. Quiet little fishing island with incredible charm. We wandered, had freshest seafood for lunch, and then spent most of our time around Marina Corricella which was near our hotel. Found another sunset cruise for €35 per person. This time the water was calm, they served prosecco and bruschetta with the best tomatoes I’ve ever had and I don’t even usually eat tomatoes. Finished the night with cocktails by the water. Limoncello spritz hits different here and definitely helps you sleep.

Day 8 - 5th August
After breakfast at the hotel we went for one last beach walk before heading to the ferry for midday. Wish we had more time on Procida, but it just gives us a reason to go back. Once we got back to Naples, we picked up the car and drove back to Rome airport to return it. From there, we took the train into the city. We’ve both done Rome before so this was more of a bonus night than anything else. We wandered, saw the Trevi Fountain and Colosseum and then called it a night.

Day 9 - 6th August
Woke up early, grabbed a coffee and croissant, and got the train back to the airport. 

I’m now wide awake at 4:30am in Toronto, about 15 pounds heavier, and definitely going through limoncello withdrawals.

So what would I change? Honestly not much. I’d probably swap the Praiano and Sorrento days just to improve the flow. I’d skip the sunset cruise in Sorrento next time just because of the price. And I’d either stay an extra night in Procida or book a later flight so we had more time in Rome. But these are tiny tweaks.

I’ve already shared all my thoughts on driving and car rental in another post so I’ll drop that in a comment below if anyone’s interested.

This was hands down one of the best trips we’ve ever taken. Italy just has that magic about it. Happy to answer any questions if you’re planning something similar.

TLDR:

Mid 30s foodie couple from UK and Canada did a 9 day self-drive Italy trip: Rome → Praiano → Sorrento → Ravello → Procida → Rome. Gorgeous weather, smooth itinerary, incredible food (special shoutout to seafood gnocchi and Mimi pizza), and some unforgettable moments like private sunset cruises and a cooking class in Sorrento. Would swap a few days around for better flow, skip one overpriced cruise, and spend longer on Procida next time. Limoncello withdrawals are real.",2,1754557030.0,ItalyTravel,6,1.0,False
1mjuyx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1mjuyx4/my_observations_after_living_in_perth_for_almost/,My observations after living in Perth for almost a year,"Here we go again. I found some time to do a follow up to the last post I made about 8 months ago.

Thanks to all who replied to all my questions in the last post, I have greatly benefited from it.

Still love it here, but I only feel like I scratched the surface of Perth.

Anyways, here goes nothing, and again, please take my opinions with a grain of salt. These are the notes I took during the last couple of months:

**Summer**

* I have reached a point where I have accepted my fate. Instead of using sunscreen, I will rub myself in oil and spice mix to become a rotisserie chicken by walking around the block.
* My visa application was very tedious and expensive. I'm glad the paperwork is done but boy, was that a lot. I was surprised when they asked if I had a criminal record. I thought that was no longer a requirement?
* In the debate Coles vs. Woolworths I have apparently joined team coles. Not because the groceries are better, simply because it's much closer and I can walk to the store.
* A sunshield in your car is mandatory. I do not like to glue my butt cheeks to the seat, especially when I'm wearing shorts. It's hard to explain the scars to my relatives at home without hearing any BDSM comments
* I was suprised by the size of mozzies. They are quite small. Whenever I saw one in the house I always thought it was a fruit fly. Until I realized my mistake.
* I have been introduced to slip, slop, slap. I would like to add an additional step called ""swear"" for obvious reasons.
* Someone recommended to visit the red hill auditorium. Fantastic shows and really cool venue, will definitely go again!
* **Do not use your oven in summer.** Don't be me, I'm stupid and I have to learn the hard way.
* Life in Perth ends around 5-6 PM. Please do not have fun afterwards, and good luck trying to run some errands. I have yet to figure out why.
* What's up with the amount of ads on the side of the road? It feels excessive and distracting.
* My wife introduced me to The Wiggles. I agree, fruit salad is indeed yummy yummy. They also remind me of Star Trek uniforms with the difference that the red wiggle doesn't die after a show.
* You have to understand something. I am from Switzerland. I live and breathe cheese. Half of our dishes are made with cheese. Good cheese. Tasty cheese. Real cheese and not industrial waste with orange food coloring. So when I went to the markets and found real swiss Gruyère cheese I got a little exited. Until I saw the price of 108$ per kg. I am not rich but also not on a budget but for that price... I got sad. Good cheese should be available to everyone and not just for the rich. ~~Vote for me and I'll make sure everyone~~

Jokes aside, I have found some decent cheese in deli's and even at Coles. Still pricey but hey now I will survive in Australia.

* The biggest problem I encountered so far being an immigrant, is that I can't vote and won't be able to try a great democracy sausage (At least I can have a bunnings sausage sizzle)
* The tapwater at home has only one setting. Hot. Also it tastes like the public pool.
* Basements are not a concept here. What are you guys afraid of? I need somewhere to stash  ...things.
* Street names are either too british or very entertaining. Whenever I have to be somewhere and I look up the street name it is either 123 Cockman road or Wanaping street. (Look it up, both are real places in Perth)
* I am struggling to find mushrooms that are not regular white or brown button mushrooms or shiitake. Would be cool to cook some but it seems like it's just too dry for anything to grow.
* Most of the electricity poles are just a tree trunk and not made out of steel/concrete. Some of them seem even a bit hazardous but I'm sure the governement knows what it's doing.
* Coffee is everywhere and it's delicious. I haven't had a bad coffe since I arrived. You should be proud Australia! Thank you very much.
* We moved to a rental with a 500m^(2) back yard with three enormous trees. In the trees live an astonishing amount of birds (I have counted over 50). I will try to befriend them and feed them a bit.
* The property doesn't have a fence around the front lawn and every day, without fail, I have to go and pick up someones trash that the wind blew on the grass. I know I am a guest here and it is not my place to make demands but please... pick up your trash.
* The diabolic synergy between high energy prices, no insulation in the house and the need to run the AC almost every day seems like a scheme by the big man to get even richer. Or you know... I could also move to a house that wasn't built in 1930/40 and then it wouldn't be such a problem. Right?
* In the short, short time it takes for my laundry to dry, the birds have decided to shit all over it. I no longer wish to befriend them.
* I miss a good german Döner Kebab. Most of the Kebabs I had here were more like a Shawarma and also very tasty but I'm sure the real thing is out there somewhere.
* The color of the borestains add a certain charm to Perth. While others might find it ugly, I do quite like it.
* The tiny flies everyone warned me off have arrived. Is anyone renting chameleons or frogs that could sit on my shoulders?
* What's up with the size of whole chickens at Coles?? What sort of ~~chernobyl~~ special feed to they get to grow so enormous?
* The continuous and neverending small talk with every cashier feels odd. Sometimes I have genuine conversations that I enjoy but every now and then it feels forced like they are being watched. Definetly different from home, there it would simply be ""Hallo, danke, und schönen Tag""
* I miss clouds. In Switzerland, the days of a clear blue sky are rare, there's always a cloud somewhere in the sky. Here a blue sky is almost the standard.
* The lack of plastic bags is annoying but welcome. I used to have a bag of bags at home with plastic bags in all sizes and shapes. But I do prefer to save the turtles in all honesty.
* There is a stereotype about Australians I have encountered in Europe multiple times; Down under, tech is expensive, and the internet is really bad. I must say, it's actually very decent and we should all point our fingers to the germans because theirs is much, ***much*** worse.
* I don't know if this is even worth a note but there is a lot of variety and diversity when it comes to letterboxes. I think it's charming to see that, in contrast to the uniformity I encountered in Switzerland.
* My dandruff and dry skin problems have almost dissapeared. I don't really know why but I'm happy about it.
* The lack of sidewalks makes it clear that Perth is a car city. It feels illegal to walk on someones front lawn just because you wanted to walk somewhere, instead of driving.
* The country is being held together by ~~child labour~~ a workforce of 16 year olds. They are suprisingly helpful, especially at Bunnings. Also employees bagging your groceries is weird, please let me do it, you already have enough to do.

**Winter** (notice how I skipped autumn? It's because it doesn't exist here)

* Where is that blue sky I complained about earlier this year?
* Gambling is everywhere. The ads, the push on gameshows, all kinds of racing, casinos... what's up with that?
* Speaking of gambling, I have tried to take the bus to work lately. Sometimes I get there on time and sometimes the house wins. On the other hand, the trains are pretty much always on time.
* It's wet. ***Where are the mushrooms??***
* The imperial influence must be stopped. Go metric! I will refuse to use freedom units even if the packaging instuctions are in cups or teaspoons or some other bullshit.
* How am I supposed to dry my clothes if it's raining almost every day? My living room looks like a dry cleaners office.
* What's up with the obsession with big things in Australia? I thought it was a joke but after googling the King Neptune Statue up north i found out there's a bunch more across the country. Hard to choose a favourite.
* There's two types of households. Either you get served tea at every occasion or it's coffee. Or it's just beer. A lot of beer.
* I noticed that the church bells arer not ringing every day like back home. I am not religious but it was part of life and now it's suddenly gone. Don't know how to feel about that one to be honest.
* Targeted political ads feel very aggressive, even borderline defaming. What about promoting what you stand for instead of criticizing your peers?
* There's a ton of small stores that are thriving and strong communities. It's wonderful to see and makes me want to help.

Thank you very much for reading my nonsense. I am very sorry if I offended anyone, please tell me so if I did. In german we say ""wer austeilt muss auch einstecken"" which translates to whoever dishes out must also take it. I didn't expect the amount of comments and discussion in the last thread, so if you do write me, keep in mind that I easily get overwhelmed and I am a coward. I will try my best to reply but I won't make any promises.",67,1754557020.0,perth,29,0.87,False

**Reclaim Your Florida Paradise: The Ultimate Guide to Lanai Cleaning in Ormond Beach**

Your lanai is more than just a patio; it's your personal slice of the Florida paradise, a place for morning coffee, evening relaxation, and making memories with family. However, the relentless Ormond Beach humidity, salt air, and frequent rain can quickly turn your beautiful oasis into a grimy, slippery, and uninviting space. When algae, mold, and dirt take over, it's time to call in the professionals. AJM Softwash Plus LLC provides expert [***Lanai Cleaning Ormond Beach***](https://ajmsoftwash.com/lanai-cleaning/) residents trust to restore their outdoor living areas safely and effectively.

**Why Your Lanai Gets So Dirty (And Dangerous)**

The dark stains and green patches on your lanai’s floor, frame, and screen aren't just dirt—they're living organisms. Contaminants like algae, mildew, and Gloeocapsa magma thrive in our warm, damp climate. Left untreated, they don't just look bad; they create serious problems:

* **Safety Hazards:** Algae growth on concrete, pavers, or tile becomes extremely slippery when wet, posing a significant fall risk for you and your guests.
* **Property Damage:** These organic growths can eat away at paint, stain wood, and degrade the sealant on your pavers over time, leading to costly repairs.
* **Reduced Air Quality:** Mold and mildew spores can become airborne, potentially affecting the air quality around your home and aggravating allergies.

**The Soft Wash Difference: Why Pressure Washing Isn't the Answer**

Many people believe a high-pressure washer is the solution to outdoor cleaning. For a delicate structure like a lanai, this is a mistake. High-pressure washing can easily tear screen enclosures, chip paint, splinter wood decking, and force water into unwanted areas.

This is why homeowners searching for the [***Best Lanai Cleaning Near Me***](https://ajmsoftwash.com/) are turning to the superior soft washing technique. At AJM Softwash Plus, our specialized service is the cornerstone of effective and safe **lanai cleaning Ormond Beach**. Our process involves:

1. **Assessment:** We first inspect your lanai to identify the specific contaminants and delicate surfaces.
2. **Gentle Application:** We apply our proprietary, 100% biodegradable cleaning solutions using low pressure—no more than a garden hose.
3. **Targeted Action:** These solutions penetrate deep to kill algae, mold, and mildew at the root, rather than just blasting the surface layer away.
4. **Thorough Rinse:** We finish with a gentle rinse, washing away all the grime and neutralized organic growth, revealing a pristine, sanitized surface that stays clean longer.

**Trust AJM Softwash Plus for Your Lanai Cleaning in Ormond Beach**

Don't let a dirty lanai keep you from enjoying the beautiful Florida weather. Choose a team that is local, licensed, insured, and committed to protecting your property. We have the expertise to clean every part of your lanai, from the screen enclosure and frame to the concrete floor and surrounding pavers, without causing any damage.

Thanks for reading and helping out!! :D

As If You Never Left
Prologue
 
Maeve

The trees beyond the shop window bent low beneath the rain, their branches shivering under the weight of it — long, silver threads slicing the late November dusk. It wasn’t winter yet, not properly, but the chill had already settled into the bones of the city. That kind of rain didn’t just fall; it pressed down. The same heavy sky. The same insistent wind curling around corners and seeping through cracks. The same pressure in the air, as if the city itself were holding its breath.

Seven years ago, it had rained like this too.
But I wasn’t outside this time.
And I wasn’t with him.

Now I was inside Penrose Books, tucked behind the counter with the scent of paper and dust warming the air. It wasn’t a big shop — a crooked little thing wedged between a florist and a coffee shop — but it had charm. The lights above glowed soft and amber, casting gentle halos over hardcovers and first editions. Outside, the world was all in motion and blur — rain streaking the windows, headlights blooming like fireflies in the dark. People passed with their heads bowed, gloved hands clutching heavy coats, scarves pulled high, boots splashing through puddles. Every collar was turned up against the cold. Faces flickered past, pale and fleeting, and I watched them — liked watching them — for the small, unguarded moments they offered before disappearing again.

When I met him, it had been summer.

The air was thick and heavy — the sharp smell of sunbaked pavement mixing with the faint green of crushed grass. People moved slow then, loose in linen and sweating in the heat, their shoulders pink and raw from the sun. Everywhere, the sticky sweetness of fruit and children with soft serve clung to fingers. There was music, always — not loud, distant — curling from balconies and car radios, the kind that made everything feel like the end of a movie you didn’t want to leave.

 It should’ve felt lighter. Brighter.
 But somehow, it didn’t.

 Now — with the rain tapping steadily at the windows, and the warm smell of old paper in the air — it’s almost winter. It should feel heavier.
 And yet, I feel lighter than I did that summer seven years ago.
 Here, in this shop, in this hush, I don’t feel like I’m slipping. I feel steady. Still.

I work nights now. It was the only way to keep studying, to stay afloat.
 Mrs. Penrose, who wore tweed skirts and smelled faintly of lavender and old paper, had given me the job a month ago. She’d interviewed me over a chipped porcelain teacup of chamomile and said only, “We close late. Can you shelve and mind the till?”
 She didn’t ask for a résumé. I think she understood that I needed the job more than anyone else. That during the day I studied to be a nurse, because I had to. It was the only thing I could do to support myself and my brother.

The world outside the bookshop was wet and dark, the kind of night where the streetlights bleed gold across puddles, and everything seems suspended in a hush. Rain knocked against the windows like it was trying to get in. I liked these nights. People didn’t linger. It gave me space to breathe, to think.
 And sometimes I still thought of him — especially when it rained like this.
 The last time I saw him, it was raining.

I’ve imagined this situation countless times.
Whether Will Ashford would recognize me or not.
When it rained, he was in my memories. When it didn’t, he was in the news – polished, distant, untouchable. It was like the world didn’t let me forget him. No matter the weather, he always found a way back in. His golden hair, eyes the same clear blue I hadn’t seen in years. Ashford International Holdings. Everyone knew the name. Everyone knew his grandfather, the CEO.
 He was abroad now. Somewhere far. Important. Gone.

But even if I knew he wouldn’t return, I still practiced the lines in my head — again and again.

In case he came back. In case I saw those golden strands, that smile when he played violin. In case I had to say something.

I’d been too caught up in my book to notice how quickly the hours slipped past.
The old clock above the till struck one a.m. with a tired groan.

I turned the key in the front door, heard the latch catch, flipped the sign. The outside air smelled of scorched sugar and something else faintly bitter — it came from the coffee shop.
I shrugged on my coat. The cold air outside met me like a wall. Damp wind rushed in and pressed against my face. My nose stung; my cheeks flushed pink.

I pulled the scarf tighter. The streets were near empty now, just the sound of rain hitting metal and stone. The world felt far away.
And then I remembered — the book. The one I’d been reading behind the counter. I turned, unlocked the door again, the bell giving a reluctant chime, and slipped back inside.

I practiced the words countless times.

That’s when I heard the bell ring again.

Someone had entered.

I didn’t turn right away. Just kept walking toward the book I’d left near the register.

 “We’re closed,” I called, gently, automatically.
I imagined what I would say, what I would do.
But then I turned.

And saw them.

Those eyes. That hair.
The same, but older.

His jaw sharper, his face more angular now, more shadowed — handsome in the way of men who have already left places behind. His shoulders broader under the wet coat, his hair darker at the roots from the rain, but still him.

He looked at me. Just looked, like he was trying to place me in a dream he’d once had and forgotten.

I’ve imagined this situation many times.
Whether Will Ashford would remember me, or not.

And then he asked:
 “Do I know you?”

I practiced the words countless times of what I would say in my head.

I didn’t even hesitate.

“No,” I said.

I’d say I don’t know you.

# Best Mylar⁤ Bag [2025]: Ultimate ‍Buying Guide

Mylar ‌bags have become an ‌essential solution for⁣ long-term storage, preservation, and protection of a‍ wide variety of items. From food and⁣ seeds to electronics and documents, these bags offer⁣ an airtight and light-resistant environment that ​considerably extends shelf life and prevents degradation. as we approach‌ 2025, the market ⁤offers an overwhelming number of mylar bag options, each promising superior performance. This ultimate buying guide aims to cut through the ⁣noise and provide a comprehensive overview of the​ best mylar bags, helping you‌ make an informed decision based ⁤on your specific needs and priorities.

This guide will cover key features, benefits, and comparisons to other products, ultimately providing ⁤a comprehensive approach ⁣to choosing the best ‌mylar bag for your application.

[[Explore Top Rated mylar bag on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=mylar bag)

## key Features ‌Analysis

The effectiveness of a mylar⁣ bag ‍hinges on several key features.‌ Understanding these specifications is⁢ crucial for selecting a bag ‍that meets⁢ your requirements for long-term storage and ‌protection.

**Thickness:** The‍ thickness of a mylar bag is measured in mils⁢ (thousandths of an inch) ​and directly impacts its durability and​ resistance to punctures and tears.

A thicker bag, ‌typically 5 ​mils ⁢or higher, offers superior protection against physical ⁣damage and⁣ environmental factors. While thinner bags (around 3 mils) may be suitable for short-term storage or less delicate items, investing in thicker bags​ is recommended for long-term preservation, especially for items that could potentially puncture the bag from the inside.As a notable​ example, ‍rough-edged ‍seeds or dehydrated foods with rigid shapes benefit from thicker mylar.

**Material Composition:**​ Mylar bags are typically constructed from ⁣multiple layers of materials, including polyester (mylar),​ aluminum foil, and​ polyethylene.

The aluminum layer ⁤provides⁤ an‍ excellent barrier against light, oxygen, and moisture, which are the primary culprits in food ⁢spoilage and‍ degradation.The polyethylene layer provides versatility⁤ and allows for heat sealing, creating⁤ an airtight closure.⁣ The quality‍ of ‍these materials directly impacts the overall performance of the bag. Superior quality bags⁤ are manufactured from food-grade materials that are free⁣ from ⁢harmful chemicals and contaminants.

**Heat Sealability:**‍ A secure and airtight seal is critical‍ for‌ preventing air and moisture from entering‌ the bag.

The ability to ⁤create a ‌strong⁢ and reliable heat seal is thus a crucial feature. look for bags that are specifically‌ designed for ⁣heat sealing and that have a wide sealing area. ​This allows for a more robust seal and reduces the risk of leaks. ‍The ideal heat sealing temperature will vary depending on⁤ the specific⁢ bag, so it is vital to follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Test the strength of the seal after cooling to ⁣ensure it is airtight.

**Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR):** OTR ⁢measures the amount of oxygen that ‍can pass through the material over a⁣ given period, typically expressed ‍in cc/m²/day.

A lower OTR indicates a better barrier against oxygen, which is essential ‍for preserving food and preventing‍ oxidation. For long-term ⁣food storage, selecting bags with a very low OTR is crucial. ​Look for bags that advertise⁣ their OTR, and ‌choose those with the lowest possible value.Low OTR results in increased shelf ⁣life and ⁢higher quality in your preserved ⁢products.**Light ⁣Transmission Rate (LTR):** LTR measures the amount of light that⁢ can ‌pass through‌ the material.

Similar to OTR, a lower LTR‌ indicates a better barrier ​against light. Light exposure can degrade many substances, especially foods, and medications. A mylar bag with‍ a low LTR (essentially ⁢opaque) ensures that your ‍stored items ⁢are protected from the damaging effects of light exposure, preserving their quality and ​extending their shelf life.

## Core Benefits

Mylar bags extend multiple benefits to consumers looking for a⁣ reliable ​and protective storage solution. Their ⁣unique properties offer ⁣value⁢ across various applications and industries.

**Extended Shelf Life:**⁤ One of​ the primary benefits​ of​ using mylar bags is their ability to significantly extend the shelf life of stored items, particularly food.By creating an airtight and light-resistant barrier, these⁢ bags​ prevent oxidation, moisture absorption,⁢ and degradation caused by light exposure. This‌ can transform a product⁣ from ‌a 'use quickly'⁢ item to a long-term ⁢consumable ​good.

**Protection from Environmental Factors:** Mylar bags provide a robust shield against various environmental factors, including moisture, oxygen, pests, and odors. This makes them ideal for ⁣storing items in challenging environments, such as humid basements, garages, or even outdoors. The tight seal prevents insects and rodents from ⁣accessing the stored contents, safeguarding them from⁢ damage and ‌contamination.**Versatility for Various ⁤Applications:**​ Mylar bags are incredibly versatile and can be used for a wide range of ⁢applications,⁢ from‍ storing food and ⁢seeds to protecting electronics and documents. They are ⁣available⁣ in various ‌sizes and thicknesses, making it easy to find the ‌right ​bag⁣ for your specific needs.⁣ Along with‍ food‌ and electronics,these ⁣bags are⁤ suitable‌ for storing medical supplies,collectible⁢ items,and even emergency supplies.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial cost of mylar bags may be slightly higher than that of standard plastic bags, their long-term cost-effectiveness is undeniable. By extending the shelf life of stored items ⁣and preventing spoilage, mylar bags can ⁢save you money⁤ in the long run. this advantage is‍ amplified ⁤for businesses operating within the hospitality, ⁣food ‌preservation or electronics industries.

## FAQs Section

Here ‍are‍ some frequently asked questions about using mylar bags for storage.

**What items⁤ are ​best stored in mylar bags?**
Mylar ⁤bags are excellent for⁣ storing a wide variety of items that are susceptible to degradation from‍ light,​ moisture,⁤ or oxygen. This includes dried foods (rice, beans, grains, pasta), dehydrated foods, nuts, seeds, spices, coffee, tea, electronics, documents, medications, and precious metals. Anything that benefits from a stable and protected environment will do well inside a mylar bag.

**How do I properly seal a mylar bag?**
to properly seal a ⁤mylar bag, you will need a heat sealer.Ensure the sealing area is ⁣clean and free of debris. Place the bag between the jaws of the heat sealer and apply ⁢pressure‌ for the recommended time, as specified by ⁣the heat ​sealer's manufacturer.⁣ After sealing, allow the bag‌ to cool wholly ‌before handling. Perform a visual inspection ⁤to ensure there are‌ no gaps ⁣or weak spots in the seal. Conduct a seal​ test by applying pressure to the bag to check ⁣for⁢ air leaks.

**Can I reuse ‌mylar⁣ bags?**
While mylar bags are durable, they are generally not recommended⁤ for reuse, especially for storing food. The heat sealing process‍ can weaken the material, making it more susceptible to tears and leaks. Additionally, reusing bags increases the risk of contamination. if you choose to reuse a mylar ⁢bag, inspect it carefully for ⁣any signs of damage and ensure it is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before use.

**Do I need‌ to use oxygen absorbers with mylar bags?**
Oxygen absorbers are⁤ highly recommended, particularly for storing food items. They remove residual oxygen from‌ the bag, creating an even⁤ more stable environment ⁢that further⁣ extends the shelf life and prevents spoilage. The bag itself provides an excellent barrier, but combining it with ​an oxygen absorber will remove the inside oxygen content. Oxygen absorbers are critical‍ for achieving years, even decades, of storage ⁢life.

It all began during one of the most uncertain moments in our lives **the COVID-19 lockdown**. While the world was shutting down, something unexpected opened up inside me.

Like millions of others, I was stuck at home, killing time by endlessly scrolling through YouTube and Instagram. No plans. No clarity. Just drifting.

And then I saw him, a PUBG streamer. Nothing flashy. No big production. Just a regular guy, sitting in his room, streaming gameplay and somehow turning it into a living.

That moment hit me hard.

 *If he could do it… why not me?*

That one concept sparked something deep within me; it didn't just happen to occur to me.



Gaming was no longer entertainment. Gaming was a doorway. I didn't have the best equipment or experience, but I did have time and fire. I began watching tutorials, learning how online content creators did things, and getting into the world of online money. COVID put the world in lockdown, but it focused me. I knew one thing: I wanted to make money online, make content, and create something of my own.



Entering the World of the Internet

The idea of making money online completely fascinated me. But it didn’t take long to realize it wasn’t just about gaming. It was about **skills**.

That curiosity led me down a rabbit hole. I discovered freelancing, dropshipping, affiliate marketing. it felt like I had just dived into a massive digital ocean, with endless paths to explore. But one stream pulled me in the most: **digital marketing**.

I began learning SEO, content strategy, and social media marketing through free YouTube tutorials and websites. I picked up small gigs managing Instagram pages, writing basic posts for just a few dollars. It wasn’t glamorous. But it was *real*. And more importantly it was *mine*.

Every tiny task became a learning moment. I built test websites, tried things, failed, adjusted, and kept going. Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork felt intimidating at first, but I kept showing up. My first few gigs barely paid for coffee, but they proved something powerful:

 **Online income was real. And I was capable of earning it.**

My first try

I was inspired, so I began a YouTube gaming channel of my own. My gear? A used phone, decent internet, and no editing skills. My first videos were unpolished, uncut, and mostly ignored, but I persisted. Every upload was a learning process. I studied what successful content creators were doing with their thumbnails, titles, voice, and engagement tactics and slowly applied it all.



I taught myself how to edit off of free programs on my phone. I later moved into better equipment. Some of the videos I worked on for hours and weren't even past ten views, but I did not quit. I refined my commentary, created better introductions, and began to gain a small, loyal following. The support I found, however small, encouraged me. This was no longer a sideline interest; it was a passion.



Uncovering Copywriting The Art of Words

As I was creating my gaming channel, I explored other talents, and that's when I discovered copywriting. I was amazed: people were using simple words to connect with, persuade, and earn money. That realization unsettled me. I surrounded myself with case studies, re-wrote ads, dissected landing pages, and even composed sample sales emails daily.



Copywriting wasn't writing; it was psychology. I put what I'd learned into practice on my YouTube titles, my freelance writing work, and social media. I began to notice results. More engagement. Improved feedback. Clients noticed. I was becoming a master of the secret skill that powers the digital universe.



The Reality Check: Struggles and Setbacks

But it wasn’t always easy. For every small win, there were double the setbacks. Videos flopped. Clients backed out last minute. Gigs went cold for weeks. And in the silence, the doubts crept in

 *Why am I not growing like everyone else?*

 *Am I even good enough?*

That mindset nearly drained the fire out of me. I started losing the joy in what I once loved.

But then I reminded myself *every creator I admired had stumbled, struggled, and failed before they ever found their footing.* None of them started perfect. They just kept going.

So I shifted my focus. I stopped obsessing over numbers and started asking better questions:

 *Am I improving? Am I learning?*

Because for me, it was never about being perfect

 It was about **progress**, about becoming better than I was yesterday.

Discovering My Voice

In retrospect, I see failure differently now. It did not destroy me; it constructed me. I learned to slow down, concentrate, and not chase trends. I started creating my own style. Now, I integrate all that I have learned about digital marketing, content creation, and copywriting to construct my brand.



I still produce content. I have small campaigns. I write for clients. But now, I do it on purpose. I'm not ""there"" yet, but I'm a heck of a lot closer. I've established a small, active community. I've created several streams of income. And most importantly, I've found my voice and my passion. If I've learned one thing, it's this: You don't need to be perfect to start. You simply need to begin. And if you remain steadfast even failure becomes your friend.",1,1754555426.0,u_Fun_Spare6078,0,1.0,False
1mjujqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforBetrayed/comments/1mjujqp/just_found_out_my_gf_was_cheating_please_help/,Just found out my GF was cheating. Please help.,"Hi everyone. This is a first time reddit post for me. I am in need of some thoughts and advice. It’s rather long so feel free to skip to the last few paragraphs if needed.

Three days ago, I (26M) found out my partner (25F) of 4+ years has been cheating on me for the past 6-12 months with her former coworker / boss (mid-to-late-30s M). I made the discovery on an international trip together after months of different difficulties in the relationship. I will start by saying that the cheating never involved any form of physical intimacy (at least to my knowledge) and is being portrayed as an overstep of a friendly ""mentor"" relationship that culminated in kinky nicknames,  light sexting (""i had a dream you were f***ing me"" etc), and sexual FaceTimes. The story goes like this.

I met my GF right out of college. She started working as an intern and/or assistant at different legal departments to start her career and kill a couple years before going to law school (which she now attends). My GF puts a lot of pressure on herself to perform well in school / attain a prestigious job etc. I had noticed that she was becoming more distant and emotionally unavailable about a year ago. I made multiple attempts to address the issue but was always faced with ""its fine"" or ""i am just stressed out"" or ""you dont understand what it is like to be in law school."" I would try to tell her my needs and that I felt neglected and she would usually agree and say she would try to fix it only to never really make an adjustment. 

About 6 months ago, i started to notice a pretty stark change in her libido driven by what i thought was a combination of the aforementioned  stress and side effects of a new prescription. I, again, tried to address it and show my support and that i was willing to show up however she needed. she was tried to deflect and deny at the start but eventually came forward to say that it was something she was struggling with and we were working through that over the last few months.

Now to the discovery. I knew she had stayed in contact with her former boss after leaving her last job and that they would occasionally catch up to talk about law school and get/give career advice, but i never thought anything. My GF moved into my apartment at the start of this summer to help facilitate her summer internship and cut down the commute time from where she usually lives. The problems above continued on but i also started to notice that she was texting her former boss almost daily and at odd hours (late at night, on weekends) which didnt make sense under my understanding of their relationship. I made particular note of it after i saw a text between them where he made reference to himself as her ""good old mentor,"" but i didnt want to confront her until the conversation came up organically.

Fast forward to last week, she tells me that she is going to be getting coffee with her former colleagues (the man in question being one of them) so i took the opportunity to tell her that her relationship with her former coworker/boss made me uncomfortable. She was incredibly dismissive and didnt even want to hear my rationale before exclaiming that their relationship is completely normal, that he is married, and that i shouldnt be able to control who she is friends with. This conversation continued for the next few days. I at one point asked to see her messages with him to try to show her an example of a text that I found inappropriate and was met with a lot of resistance. she ended up sending screenshots based on my description of the message but none of them matched up to what i saw. As an eventual resolution, we landed in a place that she would avoid contacting him on weekends and late at night, wouldnt play into nicknames, and most importantly, not be texting him during our trip together the following week.

3 days into our trip, i asked for her to show me that she hadnt been texting her former coworker, she showed me their messages and none were sent since we left. I then took her phone and went into the recently deleted section and saw that she deleted messages between them and had continued to text him the whole time (even texting him the moment we landed at our destination). After hours of painful back and forth, i finally unearthed the extent of their relationship by a combination of her telling me things and reading through their text messages. 

My understanding of the story is this: At some point in the last 6 or so months (well after they stopped working together), their friendship took a turn to where they started calling each other kinky names (""daddy"" ""good girl"" etc), sharing flirtatious ""workout"" photos, detailing their prior sex lives, lightly sexting, and occasionally facetiming with some combination of the above. The worst event came around 3-4 months ago where i guess they facetimed each other, started using their nicknames for each other, he showed her his d***, she flashed her breasts, then hung up saying they would ""be taking care of themselves."" They would have some similar conversations every few weeks  that would end with some sexual innuendo but never to the same degree as this one (again, hard to verify). 

As a short term conclusion, I told her that she was no longer a part of this trip (i was/am funding almost all of it) so we went our separate ways the next day. 

I am obviously incredibly hurt and trying to understand where this fits in the life I thought I was living. We were in the process of planning a future together and had even gone ring shopping in the last few weeks so I am just gutted. That said, no final decisions have been made yet. There is a lot to process with this including the actual acts of cheating, the cover up (lying, denial, gaslighting, etc.), a poor moral compass, risking each others professional careers, ignoring attempts to fix the relationship and the process of discovery. I am not dead set on either ending it or trying to reconcile, i am just trying to sit in all the emotions right now. Both options seem like an easy way out at the moment. She has supported me and an unequal portion this relationship in the past. I do love this girl and i think a lot of the actions stem from her past trauma (which i am aware of) and currently being in a very very bad place mentally (not to paint her as the victim as i do not feel bad for her at all at the moment). 

Any thoughts on the situation or your own prior experiences would be appreciated. Thank you all!",1,1754555380.0,SupportforBetrayed,0,0.99,False

Still zero appetite. It’s a struggle to eat and drink. Maybe doing 500-600 cals daily. Fluids are just ok, I need to drink more. Nausea is bad, Zofran helps. Putting Vital protein powder in coffee and hot tea. 

Taking 50mg tramadol every 6 hr on sched. Taking 500mg Tylenol every 3-4, not exceeding 3000mg daily. The tram makes me very weak, fatigued, nauseous. I switch Aug 7 to Journavx at 6am. Hoping it’s much better.

About me:

* 30 years old, down to earth and sarcastic by default, with a soft spot for dad jokes (sorry in advance).
* My hobbies include stepping on LEGO in the dark, trying to cook like I’m on a cooking show, and pretending I understand how the school app works.
* I’m emotionally available, baggage-claimed, and just looking to connect. Whether it’s a witty exchange, flirty chats, or something that grows into more.

About you:

* Someone who’s open-minded, good-humoured, and doesn’t mind a guy who occasionally has to pause a conversation because of bedtime chaos.
* Bonus points if you're into cosy nights, coffee-fuelled mornings, or can recommend a good show to binge when the kiddo’s asleep.

Not looking to rush anything. Just good convo, mutual vibes, and maybe some playful banter to break the ice.

If you're looking for a part of Bali *far* from the crowds of Canggu, Ubud, and Uluwatu - let me introduce you to Lovina, a quiet coastal stretch in North Bali that’s perfect for slow travel, dolphin-watching, and oceanfront sunsets.

It’s not trendy. It’s not overrun. But that’s exactly the point.

# Where & What Is Lovina?

* Lovina isn’t one town — it’s a coastal area made up of several small villages (Kalibukbuk, Anturan, Temukus, etc.).
* Located in North Bali, about 2.5–3.5 hours from Ubud or Denpasar, via a beautiful mountain drive.
* Famous for: calm seas, black sand beaches, affordable stays, and early-morning dolphin tours.

# Why Lovina Might Be Exactly What You Need

**Peace and quiet**

* Few crowds, no party scene, minimal traffic.
* Slower rhythm, great for writing, reflection, and watching life go by.

**Dolphin watching at sunrise**

* Local fishermen take small boats out early (5:30–6:00am).
* Yes, it’s touristy — but also magical when done respectfully. Ask around for ethical tour operators.

**Affordable long-term stays**

* Guesthouses start at \~$15–20/night.
* Villas with pools and ocean views from $400–700/month.
* Food, transport, and massage prices are significantly lower than in the south.

**Access to nature & day trips**

* Waterfalls: **Gitgit**, **Aling-Aling**, **Sekumpul** are nearby.
* Hot springs: **Banjar Hot Springs** are close and relaxing.
* Snorkeling/diving: easy trips to **Menjangan Island** and **Pemuteran**.

# Where to Stay

* Budget-friendly: FunkyPlace, Hotel My Lovina, Santhiku.
* Mid-range: The Lovina, Padmasari, Nugraha Lovina.
* Long-stay options: Look on Facebook or ask locals — there are many unlisted rentals.
* Tip: Kalibukbuk is the most developed area, but surrounding villages like Temukus are more tranquil.

# Where to Eat

* Warung Apple – local food, super friendly.
* Spice Beach Club – beachside sunset drinks.
* Jasmine Kitchen – tasty Thai food.
* Buda Bakery – good coffee, breakfast, and baked goods.

Also… tons of little warungs with fresh grilled fish and nasi campur for under $3.

# Getting Around

* You’ll want a scooter or private driver to explore the area.
* Local drivers offer full-day tours for $30–40 USD.
* No Grab/Gojek, but you can arrange transport easily through guesthouses.

# Who Will Love Lovina?

* Travelers seeking peace — solo, couples, or retirees.
* People on a budget who don’t want to sacrifice comfort.
* Photographers and wildlife lovers (sunsets and dolphins are daily magic).
* Slow travelers who enjoy staying put and integrating with local life.

# Who Might Not Like Lovina?

* Nightlife seekers — it’s pretty much dead after 9pm.
* Hardcore surfers — the sea here is calm, not for waves.
* Digital nomads needing coworking spaces — Wi-Fi exists, but there’s no “scene.”

# Final Thoughts

Lovina isn’t Instagram-famous, and that’s what makes it special.  
It’s a place to rest, breathe, swim, write, eat well, and remember that Bali isn’t just beach clubs and motorbikes.

If you’re doing a longer trip, consider spending a few nights — or even a few weeks — up north. You might just stay longer than you planned.

kennt ihr gute glutenfreie Spots (gerade Frühstück) in Hamburg?
Isabella kennen wir aus Düsseldorf, leider ist die Größe der Menüs viel kleiner geworden.

Wir haben was von Nord Coast Coffee gehört, wo es auch Waffeln und Pancakes gibt.

Was sind eure Tipps?",1,1754554755.0,hamburg,2,0.67,False

idk if im at right sub but i need ur help..

At around **3:28 PM**, my hands suddenly started trembling intensely, and up until now, they’re still sweaty. I’ve never had any history of anxiety before. I tried doing breathing exercises, but they didn’t work. I even checked in with my family to see if they were okay thankfully, they are.

But my heartbeat is still really fast and I feel so uneasy.  
It’s like I have this strong gut feeling that something’s wrong, or that something happened I just don’t know what.

I’ve already eaten and I’m full, but my stomach is still growling. I’m still shaking even now. 😭 This is the first time this has ever happened to me, and I’m honestly scared.

Right now, I’m at a coffee shop all I had was a matcha frappe. I haven’t gone home yet because I’m worried something might happen if I leave. Hopefully not, but I’m really shaken up and I don’t know what this is.

Please, I’d really appreciate it if anyone could discuss or explain what this might be. 🙏",0,1754554700.0,CasualPH,2,0.25,False

I'm a coffee enthusiast ☕ currently exploring the idea of a mobile app to help people track, rate and discover the different coffees they brew at home. It would be like a digital coffee journal that gets smarter over time.

The goal is to help users remember which beans they liked (or didn’t), discover similar ones and crowdsource reviews from fellow home brewers.

Right now, I’m trying to find out if people would actually want this kind of tool. I've put together a very short, two-minute survey to understand how people choose coffee and their habits around it.

https://forms.gle/mjWyH6NTiCRYpvcU9

I'd really appreciate it if you could take a moment to fill it out! I'm happy to share insights or talk more about the idea if anyone's curious.

Thanks in advance! 😊",1,1754554565.0,startupideas,0,1.0,False
