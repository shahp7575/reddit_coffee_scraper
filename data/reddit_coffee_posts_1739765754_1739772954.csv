I met this guy, J, during one of my semesters in uni last year. Our first meeting was a little bit strange because we met in front of the door leading to the classroom, with him literally just silently staring at me before ever approaching me. Like, very obviously staring at me. During class, he purposefully sat near me and asked me questions about the syllabus or things the professor said. 

Despite it being a bit of a strange meeting, I do like meeting people, so when he invited me to a coffee shop after class, I accepted. I had been approached by guys before this, but never got to form a friendship with any because they all just wanted sex (even if I made it 100% clear that I was in a long-term relationship within our first conversation, that didn't stop guys from catcalling me or harrassing me after I rejected them). I was excited, I was finally going to be able to have a normal, healthy, friendly relationship with a guy other than my boyfriend.

Things got a little weirder when I learned that J was crushing on this asian exchange student in one of his other classes. He would say things like asian girls are cute and beautiful, things that are innocent on the surface, but that has underlying meaning, if that makes sense? Like, when someone says something normal, but the way they say it just sends shivers down your spine. I remember even telling my mom that it felt like J clocked me on that day we met. Like, he saw me and was like ""her."" Because, guys, I'm asian. And I believe that J has a bad case of yellow fever. 

Despite feeling slightly uncomfortable around him, we still continued seeing each other, texting, and hanging out sometimes. What made me the most uncomfortable is something that happened pretty recently. I like posting things to my instagram and to my story, funny pictures, memes I want to share, pics of my pets, etc. J started texting me every single time after I would post something and question me about every single thing about it. What makes me uncomfortable about this is that not even my good friends/partner/family interacts with me the way he does. I can attribute it to him feeling maybe lonely? But it's  really too much for me. 

I can provide more context if questions arise, no worries. I know it's hard for me to see the situation from an outside perspective and for strangers to get the full picture as well. Basically, I want to know from an unbiased source if I'm overreacting because of my past bad experiences with men in this situation with J. Also, I did try writing him a text to explain why I haven't been interacting with him as much, but I feel like a horrible person. I don't want to cut him off, I don't want to ghost him either, but my feelings have to be somewhat valid, no? I don't know what to do.",1,1739772774.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

This is targeted at more the average folks who started from a similar build with being skinny fat.

Wondering if anyone else of you guys went through what I'm going through right now with this stomach fat thing.

And what did you guys do or would do after the lessons you learned from getting rid of it?

With my pretty active workout routine right now I feel like I have progress everywhere else except the stomach (which isn't always evident in photos, this photo was taken right after waking up and taking a shower)

Eating fairly clean:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1ien3ip/my\_daily\_meals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1ien3ip/my_daily_meals/)

(For about a week now, I cut the raspberries, just use a lot of blueberries now, I also went from 1 chicken breast to 2 chicken breasts for both my salad and dinner ---- I'm also eating a lot more greek yogurt and almonds throughout the day not demonstrated in my daily meals post)

5-10% calorie deficit, and plan to stay there as I also want to be able to switch to a calorie surplus when I start getting more core lifts to a point I want.

But I'm hoping to get rid of this annoying stomach fat/gut...

For the last month, my workout routine is:

80-100km bike ride per day (mostly on trainer right now because of snow/ice)

30 minute jog every day (not hugely intense right now because of snow/ice)

30 minutes of speed rope and then 30 minutes of bag work on my shoulder days.

45 mins to 1 hour of gym everyday 7 days a week (Day 1) Chest/Tri's - Day 2) Back/Bi's - Day 3)Shoulders/Rope/Bagwork - Day 4)Legs/Abs/Rope)

I supplement my bike rides with uncrustables or gels, greek yogurt/almonds, and protein shakes depending how hard I push it that day. The almonds/greek yogurt, and protein shakes are a good way to counter the huge rides loss in calories.

I'm doing a calorie deficit of 5-10% everyday except on weekends. On the weekends, I do a pure maintenance, I feel like it helps me recover faster.

Should I just bite the bullet, take the loss in getting stronger, and cut now? Or just maintain a 5-10% calorie deficit and keep going forward? Right now I can feel like my gym stamina and functional strength and form is coming along steadily. My workouts feel rewarding, and that's a nice mental boost to my days.

I started a month ago working out, after many many years of not working out. I would be much happier without this gut/stomach fat on me.

I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or drink coffee.

I do take creatine.

I've been watching a lot of Jeff Nippard and Renaissance Periodization and slowly learning to tweak my workout with a lot of their suggestions.

1ird8s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ird8s8/aitah_for_choosing_money_over_my_friendships/,AITAH for choosing money over my friendships?,"I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but you will need all the information. 

Around May 2024, my parents told me that I (F20) would have to pay for my own university tuition. This came as a shock, and i had not saved up nearly enough. Around the same time, my 2 friends, let’s call them Ashley (19) and Diane (19), and I decided to go on a euro trip (cost me around 5000$, 1000$ of which was a graduation gift from my parents). 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, my friends and I went to dinner for my birthday. Ashley dropped 3 of us at the front of the restaurant as we were late for our reservation, and Ashley and Diane parked the car in an indoor parking lot. This cost 30$ and Ashley put it on her mom’s card, so she asked us to transfer her 7$. I told her that I would be able to do so once I got paid. Meanwhile, we bought concert tickets and I told her to transfer me 7$ less, as we had put it on my card. A week later, i posted a story of a haul of gym clothes, and she replied saying that she couldn’t believe that I couldn’t send her 7$ for parking but I went and bought clothes. I explained to her that I hadn’t been paid in 4 weeks as i sent my hours too late and the clothes were charged on my credit. She then went on to say that it wasn’t about the 7$, but rather an accumulation of things that had led to her frustration. She told me that it was a slap in her face that I would rather buy clothes than spend money on nights out. She said that me having to save up for uni was a ridiculous excuse.  Ashley and I are not in the same financial situation. Her family is significantly more well off than mine, so she does not need to worry about paying for her education. This went on until i drew my limit and left the conversation. A few days later we went to study at Diane’s house and Ashley was there. I chose to talk about it then to get it over with. They both ganged up on me, called me materialistic, and told me that I was ruining their teenage years by not wanting to go out on adventures with them. They said that in our euro trip we only went out three times (clubbing) because i did not want to spend money, and then they found out that i had lied the whole time because i hadn’t told them about the 1000$. I had not disclosed this as i did not want to come off as condescending or bragging. Some time this year, my sister mentioned it in front of Diane, but Ashley was not there. All of a sudden, Ashley knew about this, which just indicated that they had been talking behind my back. They then went on to say that i didn’t want to go out for the rest of the summer or winter break and that i was wasting their and my teen years on clothes instead of making memories. They also added that I never pay for their coffees (according to me, this is not true, but maybe i just don’t realize it). They then added that when we do go out, i complain. I asked for examples and they said that during the summer, when we had gone to a concert, i complained about the weather (it was raining and we were in ponchos, i felt disgusting) and that when we had recently bought concert tickets i said that i couldn’t believe i didn’t spend the money on boots instead. This never happened. I was in the car with Diane the day after we bought those tickets, and i told her that i wanted to buy boots (200$) but never pulled the trigger. I also told her that when it came to the concert tickets (180$) i didn’t think twice and immediately bought them because i was investing on an experience. She twisted my words and fed them to Ashley. Diane also brought up her 18th birthday gift, saying that i had only spent 25$ on it. Just as an fyi, for her 17th i got her a designer bag and for her 19th i got her a designer wallet. For my birthdays, they have consistently bought me cheap and unthoughtful gifts, but i have never brought this up and never would as it is rude and disrespectful. At the end of the day, they could have got me nothing, but they still tried so i count my blessings and shut up. 

Anyways long story short, i was deeply hurt and felt disrespected because neither of them are in the same situation as I am. They are not the ones who have to save up to afford their educations; I am. 

I also want to add that while we were planning the euro trip, i had made a joke and said that Ashley couldn’t pay for her gas so how would she afford a trip. She found that this was highly disrespectful and asked me not to speak on her money. I agreed and apologized because i thought that she was right. Now, they both feel like they have a right to speak on MY money so freely and unashamed. 

In the past, Diane has had a tendency to take Ashley’s side in things, but she is typically a rational and sweet person. So i just dont understand how in such a delicate situation, she would not see the wrong. 

I left Diane’s house telling them both that I expect an apology, and until then, I wouldn’t speak to them. AITAH?",1,1739772537.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

(Please delete if not allowed),"To preface this story, I’m a 26 year old female real estate agent whose face and contact information is readily available and marketed. I’ve understood that this could make me a potential target for stalking and I’ve always been extremely cautious within my professional and personal life. 

In a previous state I worked in, I had a situation with an AirTag being attached to my car and alerting me that it was tracking my movements for over 24 hours. It shook me up a little but nothing ever really came of it and I ended up moving states a while after. I also had an incident with a man who harassed me and reported me to my board of ethics and relentlessly made me feel uncomfortable and I had to go through a drawn out process and hearing with him to eventually clear my name. This man is a convicted felon and has a history of harassing women. This was also back in the previous state I lived in and doubt this is related. 

Now back in my home state, I have settled down and have increased marketing and exposure for myself and my business. I have a concealed weapons permit and am very aware of my surroundings in my day to day life. 

Today, within minutes of getting my drink from Starbucks, I get this text (see attached). I’m used to getting random texts but the timing of this seemed strange. I tried to reverse search the number and it looks to be a fake. My fiancé bought my drink so no cards of mine were associated with the transaction.

Am looking for an Irish perspective. I’m female, not Irish but have lived here a while. My other half, Irish male, a few years off retirement, drinks what I would call heavily, and passes it off as being ‘the way the Irish are’. I’m genuinely looking for opinions as to whether I’m overreacting. Here’s how the week generally goes:


Friday night, drinks from around 7-8pm until around midday next day. It’s a battle to get him to get some sleep and usually results in me getting annoyed, which starts my weekend off badly. I work a stressful job with long hours and can’t get enough sleep during the week so Saturdays are usually a late start for me. 
He sleeps until around 6pm, then does the same thing Saturday. 
Sunday, he generally goes for a couple of pints, but comes home and keeps going. I happened to be awake this week and heard cans being cracked at 2.30, 3.20 and 3.55am. He wasn’t in bed at 5am when I was writing this. 
Monday he usually works from bed. He usually naps after work through to Tuesday morning 
Tuesday he’s up and working but still exhausted so sleeps again after work. 
Wednesday and Thursday are great. He’s engaged, chatty, laughing etc. He often talks about wanting to fix his sleeping schedule. 
Friday the cycle starts again. 


He’d be quick to say to me that he’s ’de-stressing’, or ‘having a couple of beers’ and that ‘Irish men are incapable of having 2-3 beers and calling it quits’. But my god I’m so lonely. I can go a whole weekend with no interaction past asking for a coffee at a shop. I’m not really a people person, but I like small interactions, and I’m sick of doing things alone. I don’t think he’s got a physical addiction, he stops drinking randomly for a few weeks sometimes, and life is amazing during that time. 


On a separate note, is it typical for Irish men to forget their other halves birthdays? He says it is, he says ‘typical Irish male, have to be reminded of everything’. Last year he forgot completely until a family member reminded him mid afternoon. The year before was a ‘big’ birthday for me. He asked me what I wanted to do when I brought it up, I named a country I wanted to go to, he said he didn’t want to go there, and that was the end of it, it was never brought up again. I don’t want gifts, but am I wrong to want a little acknowledgment? I always acknowledge his birthday with a small gift, or treats or something. 


Everyone tells me that he thinks I hung the moon and stars but I am just so lost, I just don’t believe it any more.


Am I overthinking or overreacting? Is this typical and should I just get used to it? I’ve brought it up in the past and things improved in the short term but we always end up back at the same place. ",2,1739770596.0,AskIreland,3,1.0,False

Last week my mom had an acute ischemic stroke in the paramedian right parietal lobe and they found an older- 
chronic stroke in the right thalamocapsular lucunar region in the brain (they suspect happened between April 2024 and February 2025) (I suspect happened between April 2024 and July 2024) because this change is compared to an MRI she had in 04/24

MRI also shows a third finding- Stable focus of susceptibility artifact in the right centrum semiovale which may represent a small cavernoma. 

Admitted on Tuesday and I didn’t leave her side for 5 days straight until a family member could relieve me. The original plan was for her to go to an acute rehabilitation center starting tomorrow (Monday) for PT/OT/ speech therapy but she was discharged home today (unexpectedly) (the only time I wasn’t there) and I am worried sick and upset. I’ve been by her bedside 5 days in a row and the day I had to return to work (Sunday) with plans to go back immediately to hospital tomorrow (Monday) before she goes to rehab she was discharged home. (My sister took her home/ I wish she would’ve pushed for rehab but she’s not as stern as I am).

I've seen people say going OMAD kills your metabolism and leaves you hungry throughout the day. But I find I usually feel much more satisfied and less hungry than with several smaller meals. Right now I am doing 1500 calories a day. For the past couple of weeks, I was generally doing around 200 cals for breakfast (protein bar and coffee) and then two meals of 400-800 for lunch and dinner, then making up the difference with a snack. My experience with this kind of diet was that I always felt like I could eat more. It felt like I was eating a good amount, but not enough to stop me from being hungry, and thus I always wanted to snack and had to resist the impulses.

Recently I started doing OMAD, having just a coffee in the morning and then having a full lunch/dinner sometime later with a large 1300-1500 calorie meal that really, really filled me up. The result is that I don't feel hungry at all for the rest of the day and even into the morning of the next day. I don't wake up hungry and can go on with just my coffee until the afternoon. My go-to meal for this is a local Asian chain with a large bowl containing white rice, teriyaki chicken, veggies, and a fried egg. Pretty similar to a Panda Express plate with half white rice half veggies and teriyaki chicken, but a little better. That leaves me full-on food coma knocked out and not hungry at all. Chipotle bowl with extra rice, beans and every veggie with no cheese or sour cream also fills me up. Do you think this kind of diet is bad in the long run or is it too dependent on other factors to say for sure?",1,1739770198.0,loseit,2,0.57,False

1irch1x,https://i.redd.it/4gelvbdiwmje1.jpeg,It's there Even a Winner? kitchenaid KF8 vs. Ninja Luxe Cafe,"I have been using a Kitchenaid KF8 for a few months now and recently had the chance to get my hands on a Ninja Luxe Cafe. I have experience with semi-auto machines as I own a Breville Infuser and Eureka espresso grinder. It just didn't get used much as the workflow was painful. Especially if I needed to make a drink for my wife and I. The need to weigh the dose, grind, tamp, pull a shot while weighing and timing it. If it was a bad shot, I needed to clean the portafilter, change grind setting and repeat all steps. It was a pain. You get the point.

The KF8 has been an amazing machine. It replaced my SCA drip coffee machine that was used every morning and instead of drinking a black coffee now, my new morning drink has become a latte macchiato or flat white. The morning worklow is crazy easy, quick and the drinks taste good. My wife's morning drink now is an Americano. While she never made the morning coffee, that was my job, the KF8 is so easy, she just makes her own drink when she wakes up. Even my teenage son uses the machine to make iced vanilla lattes.

When the Ninja Luxe Cafe was announced, I was so intrigued and wanted to buy one. I fought so hard to convince myself I didn't need it and to not spend the money. I did a good job holding out until I was able to get one with points. So to be clear, it didn't cost me anything out of pocket. I will say the workflow is way better then a standalone semi-auto with a separate grinder. The built in grinder, grinds by weight as it has a built in scale which is a game changer. No weighting beans for the perfect amount. The barista assist is very helpful in getting the right grind size. Sometimes it wil change as the beans age in the hopper or in the bag but usually it has stayed at the same recommended grind setting for the same bean. The tamper they include works well with the dosing funnel and no guessing games on how hard to tamp. The auto frother works well too, but it cannot froth at the same time as pulling a shot, but can for cold foam only. The auto frother also takes a little time to complete the frothing. You also need to make sure you are there to clean the steam wand as soon as it's done so the milk doesn't stick to it. Using the steam wand manually works well and is quicker but requires more hands on work. Obviously the espresso tastes good from the Ninja. It's about an 18g shot and will be a little more stronger then the KF8, although not everyone might not even like that better. The ratio is chosen in the machine. There are two US versions of the machine. Mine does a 1:2, 1:2.5, and 1:4 ratio. There is another US version that does a 1:3 instead of a 1:4. I like having the 1:4 ratio and do drink that one often and is more like an espresso lungo.

The machine really shines with the cold foam option. Add some flavored syrup to the milk and whip up a cold foam cold brew drink that's fantastic. It's a must have drink from the machine.

For $500, the Ninja delivers a great espresso experience with a mix of some manual work and automated work. Still requires cleaning and hands on more then a superauto. My wife and kid would not use it to make a drink, ever, like they do with the Kitchenaid.

I will say the Kitchenaid makes drinks very comparable, especially milk drinks, and next to the Ninja, you can really see how good the KF8 is, although it's way more expensive than the Ninja. If you want a fully auto process, super easy cleanup, then you cannot go wrong with the Kitchenaid. If you want to save money and don't mind spending more time making drinks. A lot more time if you are going to make multiple drinks, the Ninja is great for the price.

In my house, the KF8 will get used a lot more and I don't think I will feel like I am drinking anything inferior really. The only requested drinks from the Ninja in my house have been the cold brew, cold foam drinks.

As for the drip coffee from the Ninja, I haven't played with it much but so far seems on the weaker side. It is definitely more drip like than a superauto as you get zero crema when making a drip coffee like you will get from a superauto.

I've been eyeing the KitchenAid KF8. The machine looks like good value for money and convenience. I'm currently using a Breville Barista Express and just wondering if flavor profile of espresso is really that much of a difference with these super-auto machines. Sounds like the tradeof is convenience for delightful espresso, but how drastic is the difference? Is it night and day? Are the drinks coming out of these machines better than coffee shops? I always make milk based drinks and usually make at least 2-3 latte's per day. My wife loves the homemade coffee, but it's somewhat of a pain making the drinks every single day, even more so if I have friends and family over and making back to back drinks.

Would love opinions of people coming from Semi-Automatic machines. I'm also wondering how well back to back drinks work with these machines (specially the KF8 since that's the one I'd really like to get based on reviews I'm seeing).

Hey, if this doesnt fit, have no problem taking down, and hopefully it is not a big crazy ramble  i just feel quite confused.

I (32X) and my best friend (27X) have known each other 6 or 7 years, became quite close 4 years ago and began hanging out more. It took a great bit to come out to them 3 years ago as i was in a near terrified state about it.

As friends we are quite close. We have a strong platonic friendship we like to do coffee, activities, dinners hang out, do nothing amd just sit in presence. They've been someone I'm able to talk about feelings and concerns as well as thi gs I've worked through with starting low dose HRT.

My friend is Asexual, Myself am just  confused in general. It was a huge thing to come to the conclusion and understanding of being non binary. Originally I chose Pan to describe myself as I like everything, but I'm picky on how I get there. I like the concept of sex. But it's really not my thing and I haven't had sexual relations in years. And don't really know what I am.

 My friends love language is touch. Mine is the same. They are a very cuddly individual, they love hugs and if we are on the couch it's not uncommon to sit and cuddle or give head scratches.

Over the last few months things have changed in that we would walk around and sometimes they'd reach out hold Hands or they would hold my arm. One night at a queers and beers in the summer we where sitting in a stool area and when I came back with a drink, they casualy placed their knee between mine an placed there hand on my thigh as we talked.  And in recent months they have patted my bum in a playful matter, or as we have cuddled their hand has accidentally brushed or fallen onto my developing breasts an lingered. 

i love them as a friend so deeply, and atribute that for them it is being in a safe place and possibly their exploration without risk maybe. But I'm feeling  a little confused with it all to and feel like I'm reading too deep between the lines or am like obliviously stupid.

I feel like theres a small crush from it but i dont know how to decrive myself or what i am and I don't wanna push them away  but don't wanna overreact either and call them out and make them feel embaressed.

I had an endoscopy a month ago for suspected varices in my stomach that were shown on a CT Scan 4 years ago. Late I know but I didn't know I had a problem until I decided to question my doctor about what these varices were exactly as I was never told there was a problem. ( I had a severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis attack in 2016 and almost certainly a splenic vein clot from it and a pseudocyst which was shown to have disappeared in 2021 on the scan that showed the varicss). I was given versed and fentanyl for conscious sedation but the last thing I remember is feeling dizzy and going to sleep. When I woke up I remember feeling woozy and I was given a small can of gingerale to drink. I had not ate or even had anything to drink for over 17 hours and my procedure got delayed an extra 2 hours even, the only thing I did do was smoke cigarettes. I had zero appetite after the procedure, and took two sips of soda. I was fine but woozy on the 45 minute ride home but I kept having a nasty wet dog smelling burp. I get home I was moving around trying to give my bunny her lettuce and clean her litter box, trying to talk to my husband and still feeling woozy as I talked and moved. Each time I'd talk it was like the nausea got worse. I had the sudden urge  to have a bowel movement which I did, fine and good and then all of the sudden the burps turned into the mouth watering wretch feeling and I puked exactly twice. I vomited brown flecks and brown fluid with absolutely zero acid feeling. I did have biopsies taken but I'm not sure why this happened to me. I panicked for several days as I'm sure it was coffee ground emesis but I did call a doctor at the hospital I had it done at the GI department who said it was most likely the medicines and the biopsies and the main gastro doctor who ordered the egd agreed it was probably from the biopsies. I was pretty scared going into it in the first place with having varices and having a camera poking around in there but the vomit unlocked a new fear for sure. I think I've actually had my varices for 9 years now and have no idea why, but I found this out after digging further into my records. ",1,1739769182.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I’m extremely loyal and always go out of the way for my friends, with thoughtful plans, gifts, moments etc. In the last 3 years, I lost 1 friend who randomly stopped talking to me and flirted with an ex boyfriend, another one who acted insane and controlling during a vacation we took together, another who kept blocking and unblocking me because of his toxic girlfriend, another who scammed me for money when I went to visit her on the other side of the world. The only one I thought I had left had a baby a year ago, she said don’t stop hanging out with me even after I have the baby, I took that seriously and tried to make plans (even just a coffee date or dinner simple) and she constantly cancels(she is notorious for this even before the baby, for years)  She’s a single mom so I asked her if she wants to have dinner on Valentine’s Day two weeks in advance so she doesn’t feel lonely and feels loved. I was going to bring her flowers and bake brownies then she cancels 3 hours before and makes an excuse which I know is a lie, and hasn’t texted or called since. I try to communicate with all these people and talk to them before making the decision to let them go. All I want is friends who reciprocate the same energy. I just want to a girl best friend who I can talk and do things with. I tried to be nice and interactive with these 2 girls I know and my boyfriend worked with them before, but I feel like they are only nice to me on the surface and don’t want anything to do with me because they are friends with my ex’s current girlfriend. I’m unemployed right now due to mistreatment from my previous manager and I feel so lonely. I start a new job in 4 weeks I hope there is people who want to be friends with me.

I don't want it to be boring, I really don't but I can't help it, I just don't know what to say, i always end up uttering some stupid shit like why the fuck did I think it was a good idea to tell him about coffee enemas wtf 

His voice is so calming and i could listen to him talk all day long, ugh it just never seems enough, I sometimes wonder how did I get so lucky. He sounds so cute when he laughs fuck i could orgasm at that  nvm.

1irc0n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialNightmares/comments/1irc0n4/please_remember_me/,Please remember me.,"I'm wedged in a crowded subway car when the world around me lurches. It's like that jolt just before a car crash—a gut-punch of wrongness that freezes everything mid-motion. Every passenger—students, suits, a mother bouncing her baby—suddenly stops moving. Then, as one, they all turn their heads and **look directly at me**.

My stomach slams into my throat. A dozen strangers fixate on me in perfect unison. Not **blinking**. Not **breathing**. The subway car is dead silent, a silence so total it presses on my eardrums. I forget how to breathe. My heart is thudding in my ears as I stare back at all those empty eyes.

Then, just as abruptly, life resumes. The train's rattling roar rushes back, and the strangers casually return to what they were doing—talking, scrolling on their phones, tending to that now-crying baby—as if nothing happened. Laughter and chatter rise around me. **No one** acknowledges the last ten seconds of eerie silence and synchronized stares. I'm left trembling, plastered against the pole, wondering if I'm the only one in the world who just saw **that**.

I shove my way off at the next stop without even thinking, even though it's not mine. I burst onto the platform, my pulse jackhammering. The train doors slide shut behind me and it pulls away, carrying its oblivious passengers. I stand there on the platform, gasping in the cold underground air, trying not to scream. *Did that really happen?* People **don't** just freeze like mannequins and then pretend it was nothing.

Maybe I imagined it. Maybe it was some bizarre prank. I keep replaying it in my mind as I climb the stairs to the street. The crisp night air hits my face, but I barely register it. My thoughts are racing. **Everyone** on that train had turned to stare at me, eyes blank. And I swear for a second, it felt like **I** was the only real thing in that car.

I walk the thirty blocks home. I can't bring myself to get on another train or bus. Every person I pass on the sidewalk makes my muscles clench, expecting them to stop and swivel their heads toward me. It doesn't happen again, not on the walk home at least. The city hums with its usual nighttime energy—distant car horns, a couple arguing in an alley, music thumping from someone's window. Totally normal. By the time I reach my apartment building, I start to wonder if I hallucinated the whole thing. Maybe I **do** need sleep.

Inside, I double-lock my door and sag against it, trying to collect myself. I flick on the TV for background noise—some nature documentary, the volume low. My hands are still shaking. I feel **on edge**, like a terrified animal. *It's stress,* I tell myself. *I've been working too hard.* Maybe I **fell asleep** on the train for a second and dreamed the whole thing? That almost sounds reasonable.

The TV babbles on, some soothing voice talking about whale migrations. I stretch out on the couch, still in my jacket, and stare at the ceiling to calm down. The glow of the TV washes flickering colors over my walls. Gradually, my heartbeat steadies. The longer nothing weird happens, the more I start to feel foolish. It had to have been my imagination or a momentary glitch in my brain. People don't just freeze in place like that. There has to be an explanation—maybe a brief power outage? But that wouldn't freeze people...

My eyes drift to the clock on the wall. **10:13 PM**. The next thing I know, I blink—and it's **2:47 AM**.

I shoot upright on the couch, heart pounding. The clock **now** reads 2:47. The TV is off, the apartment lights are out. I'm sitting in the dark, and I don't remember turning anything off. I don't remember **anything** since 10.

A cold wave of panic rolls through me. I scramble for my phone and check the time and date—2:48 AM, now early the next morning. I lost over four hours in an instant.

Did I fall asleep? I don't feel groggy or rested. My head aches, and my heart is racing as if I'd been awake this whole time. It's like one moment I was lying on the couch, and a second later I'm sitting upright in the middle of the night.

I fumble to turn on a lamp. The room looks the same, except... the half-eaten sandwich I left on the coffee table is exactly as I left it, not a bit dried out. The glass of water is still full. If I'd truly fallen asleep for hours, the ice cubes would have melted—but three solid cubes still clink against the glass. It's as if no time passed at all, at least not **inside** my apartment.

I feel the couch cushions. They're not even warm from me lying down. A chill runs through me. Maybe I **did** black out or have some kind of seizure? The idea almost comforts me—better a medical problem than... than reality doing something impossible. I sit there in the pool of lamplight, rubbing my face and trying to steady my breathing.

There's no chance I'll sleep now. I spend the rest of the night watching infomercials on mute and flinching at every creak of the building. I keep flipping channels, too antsy to focus. The images on the screen blur together after a while: smiling salespeople, cartoons, static, news, more static...

I must have zoned out because the next thing I notice is the sunrise pushing pale light through my window. I jump at the realization that morning's arrived and I've been sitting here, hugging a pillow, all night. My eyes feel raw and sandy. Whatever happened last night, whether I dreamed it or not, I'm not going to figure it out by holing up in here.

On autopilot, I get dressed and head into work early. **Normalcy**—I crave normalcy today. Maybe a boring day at the office will ground me. The world feels **almost** normal on my commute (I opt to walk again, avoiding the subway altogether). The city is yawning to life: garbage trucks clattering by, commuters in suits grabbing coffee, school kids trudging to the bus stop. I find myself scrutinizing everyone's face that I pass. Any distant, blank stares? Any synchronized movements? But it's all reassuringly ordinary. My shoulders gradually loosen.

By the time I reach my building, I'm telling myself last night had to be stress, or some waking dream. It **had** to be. I even laugh under my breath at how crazy it sounds. Hell, I almost convinced myself... until mid-morning.

I'm at my desk sipping my third cup of coffee, answering emails, when my coworker Dan leans over the partition.

""Hey,"" he says, ""you coming to the all-hands meeting at 1:00?""

I jerk in surprise, nearly spilling coffee on my keyboard. My nerves are still fried. ""Jesus, Dan, you scared me,"" I sigh. ""Yeah, I'll be there."" We chat for a minute about a report we’re working on, then he heads off to his cubicle on the other side of the floor.

I take a deep breath. *Act normal,* I remind myself. No one here knows about my crazy night. Just focus on work, get through the day. I manage to answer a few more emails, and for a little while, it's okay. The tapping of keyboards, phones ringing, the printer chugging—office white noise that actually calms me.

Maybe around 10:30, I stand up to stretch. I'm staring at the flickering fluorescent light above (it’s been faulty for weeks, never getting fixed), when Dan pops his head over my cubicle wall again.

""Hey, you coming to the all-hands at 1:00?"" he asks, eyes friendly.

I freeze mid-stretch. A trickle of ice water seems to slide down my spine. ""Uh... you just asked me that,"" I say, trying to smile, hoping I misheard him.

Dan furrows his brow. ""No I didn't. I just got in. So, are you coming or not? We're ordering pizza.""

My mouth goes dry. He **did** just get in—? I glance at the clock on my screen: 10:32 AM. That can't be right; he was here over an hour ago talking to me... wasn't he? I stammer something about yes, I'll be there, and he nods slowly, giving me an odd look. He walks away, shaking his head like I'm the weirdo.

I sit back down, my legs wobbling. Did I imagine the first conversation? I rub my temples, trying to recall it exactly. I remember him asking about the meeting. I remember **answering** him. I remember the smell of his obnoxiously strong aftershave and the coffee stain on his shirt. I didn't imagine that.

I peek over the partition—Dan is at his desk typing away, coffee stain and all. So he **was** here earlier. But he acted like it was the first time we talked today. Like the last hour rewound itself and played out again.

A heavy dread settles in my gut. I'm **not** okay. Something is seriously wrong, and it's not just me being tired.

I grab my phone and, under my desk, text my best friend: *""Are you free tonight? I really need to talk.""* She replies almost immediately: *""Sure. Everything okay?""*

No. Nothing is okay. But I just type, *""I'll tell you later. Meet at Donovan's at 7.""*

All day, I can't concentrate. I jump every time someone walks by or a phone rings. I'm bracing for something else to happen, for reality to hiccup again. But aside from my nerves being shot, nothing out of the ordinary occurs. By five o'clock I'm out the door like my shoes are on fire. I practically sprint the seven blocks to Donovan's, a little bar my friend Lisa and I frequent.

She's already there, sitting in our usual booth, looking worried. I'm ten minutes early but she must have rushed over after work. That’s Lisa—always has my back. Just seeing her gives me a surge of relief. I'm not alone. I'll explain what's happening and she'll help me figure this out.

But I also feel a prickle of anxiety: what if I sound completely insane? I slide into the booth and she immediately grabs my hands. ""Hey... you look awful. What's going on?"" she asks, concern all over her face.

I open my mouth and for a moment I just **hesitate**. Where do I even start? Eventually, with a shaking voice, I start at the beginning: the subway last night. As I describe it, I can see it sounds bad; my voice is too intense, my eyes darting. Lisa squeezes my hands and listens, her face unreadable. I tell her about the lost four hours, how I blinked and it was almost 3 AM. My voice drops to a frantic whisper as I describe Dan **asking me the same question twice**, like a real-life glitch in time.

By the time I finish, my heart is hammering all over again. I half-expect her to laugh, or tell me I'm overworked, or maybe gently suggest I check myself into a hospital. But she doesn't.

Instead, Lisa takes a slow breath. ""That... is a lot,"" she says carefully. Her eyes search mine, as if looking for signs I'm joking or delusional. ""I know you. You're not one to make up something like this.""

""**I'm not!**"" I grip her hands tightly. ""Something is wrong with me... or with the world. I don't know which."" My voice cracks, and I realize I'm on the verge of tears right there in the bar. I force myself to breathe.

She nods, still watching me intently. ""Okay. Okay. First off, you need to calm down a little."" She gives a half-smile. ""If this is real, panicking won't help. If it's not, well, panicking definitely won't help.""

I let out a shaky laugh, more of a sob.

""It could be stress,"" she continues gently. ""You've been working crazy hours, right? And not sleeping."" She glances at the dark circles under my eyes. ""Maybe these were like, panic attacks? Or some kind of dissociation? The mind can play weird tricks when you're exhausted.""

I want to protest, but she barrels on. ""Listen, maybe you should see a doctor, just to rule out anything neurological. And take a few days off work. You seriously look like you're about to keel over.""

I swallow hard. Part of me wants to accept that, to let this all be **me** going crazy. At least a doctor might find something to fix. But another part of me is screaming that it's **not** just in my head. It happened to other people too—Dan was acting like nothing was wrong, like his memory got wiped. And Lisa didn't see those people on the train freeze, but they did... I know they did.

""I... I know how it sounds,"" I say, voice low. ""It sounds insane. But I'm **not** imagining it, Lisa. It happened. And I'm scared."" My last words come out in a choked whisper.

Her face softens. ""I know you're scared."" She slides out of her side of the booth and comes around to hug me. I lean into her, grateful, but I'm also rigid as a board. I keep glancing around the bar, half expecting the other patrons to start staring at me like the subway crowd did. Everyone seems normal, clinking glasses, watching the basketball game on the TV above the bar. For once, I'm thankful a noisy bar is just a noisy bar.

Lisa pulls back and looks me in the eye. ""We'll figure this out, okay? I'll help you."" She reaches for her phone. ""Maybe we should document this. Like, if it happens again, take a video on your phone, or—""

All of a sudden, her words cut off. Her mouth is still open slightly, like she *forgot what she was about to say*. Lisa's eyes glaze over, unfocused. She loosens her arms around me and sits back, blinking slowly.

""Lisa...?"" I wave a hand in front of her face. My heart kicks into high gear. Not again, please not again.

She snaps back and gives me a puzzled look. ""Oh! Hey, when did you get here? Sorry, I was in la-la land."" She laughs as if nothing's wrong. ""You said you needed to talk, so talk! What's up?""

I just stare. *No, no, no...* This isn't happening. But it is. She’s looking at me with polite, mild curiosity—the way she would if we had just sat down. The last **half hour** of me pouring out my soul... she **doesn't remember a damn thing**.

My throat works, but no sound comes out. I manage to croak, ""Lisa, you... you don't remember what I was just saying?""

She tilts her head. ""Uh, we literally just sat down. You haven't said anything yet. You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

At that word, *ghost*, a hysterical laugh bubbles up in my chest. Maybe I have. Maybe I'm the ghost. Or becoming one.

I grip the edge of the table. It's happening **again**, and this time right in front of me. Something **took the last 30 minutes**from Lisa. It plucked the conversation right out of her head. *Or it plucked me out and put me back?* Either way, reality just did another sleight of hand, and I'm the only witness.

""I... I'm not feeling well,"" I stammer, pushing up from the booth so fast I nearly knock the table over. My beer glass sloshes, toppling and spilling foam across the table and into Lisa's lap.

""Hey!"" She jumps up, cursing as cold beer soaks her jeans.

""S-sorry!"" I sputter, backing away. My chair legs squeal on the floor. Heads in the bar turn toward us, drawn by the commotion. For one horrible second I expect them to **all** go blank-eyed and stare at me again. But they just look annoyed or amused and turn back to their business.

Lisa is standing now, dabbing at her jeans with a napkin, looking equal parts angry and concerned. ""What's going on? Why are you—""

""I'm sorry,"" I babble. ""I have to go. I'm so sorry!""

And then I'm running out of the bar, stumbling on the threshold and nearly faceplanting on the sidewalk. Behind me I hear Lisa calling my name, her voice confused and a little frightened. I just keep going, practically sprinting down the block. I can't face her again, not after that. How could I even begin to explain?

Cold night air burns in my lungs as I slow to a walk a few streets away. I wrap my arms around myself. I'm shaking all over, and not just from the autumn chill. Whatever **this** is, it isn't stopping. It's getting worse. First some random subway car, then my coworker, now it’s targeting my best friend and wiping her memory in front of my eyes. Because I tried to tell her.

A new thought pushes its way into my panicked brain: **it doesn't want me to tell anyone**.

Is this thing—this force—punishing me for talking about it? The idea sounds paranoid even to me, but how else to explain what just happened? Maybe I'm drawing the wrong conclusions... maybe Lisa really did just zone out. But in the exact moment I was telling her about my experiences? The coincidence is too much.

I wander in the general direction of my apartment, not ready to go home but not sure where else to go. At some point I realize tears are streaming down my face. I feel raw, exposed, **utterly alone**.

Back in my apartment, I pace the living room relentlessly. I'm afraid to sit down, afraid I'll lose time again if I do. My eyes flick to the clock every few seconds, obsessively checking that time is still moving normally.

By 11 PM, I've decided that if I can't trust my own perception of reality, I'll have to record it externally. There has to be **proof** of these lapses, something I can show to Lisa or a doctor or... I don't even know who. I just need proof that I'm not losing my mind.

I dig out my old digital camcorder from a closet. I position it on the bookshelf opposite my couch, framing it wide so it captures most of the living room, including me. I make sure the timestamp is correct and hit record. The little red light winks on.

With a sigh, I sit on the couch, facing the camera. I probably look ridiculous: wild-eyed, half in shadow (I left a lamp on in the corner), talking to myself. But I **do** talk, if only to narrate a bit. ""Um, it's 11:07 PM,"" I say softly, hearing the quaver in my own voice. ""I'm going to stay awake tonight. If I... black out again, maybe this will catch it."" I give a nervous laugh. ""Okay. Here goes.""

I don't dare turn the TV on; I'm afraid that might somehow trigger another lost time episode. So I just sit. And wait.

Midnight crawls by. Every muscle in my body is tense. I try playing a game on my phone to distract myself, but my eyes keep flicking up to the clock, to the camera, to the window, to the clock again.

Sometime around 2 AM, I start nodding off despite my best efforts. I snap awake each time my chin hits my chest, heart jolting, furious with myself. I slap my face, pace the room, even shout out loud to keep alert. I wish I had bought some energy drinks or something. I'm so damn tired...

I don't remember falling asleep. I must have, because the next thing I know, watery daylight is filtering through the blinds. I jump up, disoriented, nearly tripping over the coffee table in my rush to grab the camcorder. My hands are numb and clumsy from sleep deprivation as I hit the stop button and scroll back through the footage.

4:15 AM... 4:30 AM... Did I lose time? The timestamp will tell me.

I rewind and watch intently. The first couple of hours, there I am on the couch, shifting occasionally, eyes on my phone. Around 1:55 AM I see myself yawn, eyes heavy. My head starts to droop. I fast-forward a bit. I'm basically dozing in and out.

At **3:14:22 AM**, the timestamp blinks and **freezes**. The video timer actually **stops** for about 10 seconds, then resumes at **6:47:53 AM**. My jaw falls open. That can't be right. I manually drag the slider back to the moment it happens and play it in slow-motion.

At 3:14:22, my on-screen self is slumped on the couch, eyes closed. Then there's a flicker of static—just one or two frames of gray fuzz—and suddenly the couch is **empty**. The timestamp jumps forward to 6:47:53. Another flicker of static, and I'm on the couch again, in nearly the same position, head lolled to the side, a string of drool from my mouth.

I pause the playback and just **stare** at the screen. My mind can't process what I'm seeing. According to this, I **ceased to exist** for three and a half hours. Either that or I got up, somehow stopped the recording, did *something*, then sneaked back and started it again without disturbing the camera position... which would be an insane thing to do in my sleep.

No. The simplest explanation is the worst one: I was **gone** during those missing hours, and now I'm back. Just like the camera shows.

I rewind and watch it again, feeling my skin crawl. There's no jump in the room's shadows, no discontinuity in the background noises (I can hear the faint hum of my fridge throughout, it just *cuts out* during the static and resumes after). It's like the whole world paused with me gone, then picked back up.

My hands are shaking so badly I nearly drop the camcorder. I want to show this to Lisa—but a sickening realization dawns: if reality is editing itself, maybe that video evidence won't **mean** anything to anyone else. Or worse, it could vanish or change too. For now, it’s there. I still exist, because I'm watching it, because I remember.

I need answers. I need help.

I grab my laptop and start searching the internet frantically: ""time freeze everyone same time"", ""losing hours of time not illness"", ""people acting like nothing happened glitch"". My search history must look deranged. Most results are junk or irrelevant—science fiction fan theories, threads on schizophrenia and epilepsy (I briefly consider those, but nothing quite matches what's happening to me), a couple of creepy reddit threads about ""glitches in the matrix"" that feel **too** on the nose.

I refine the search terms again and again. It's almost 9 AM now and I'm running on pure adrenaline. Finally, buried on page 7 of my search results, there's a link to a **paranormal** forum discussing odd occurrences. One post from six years ago catches my eye: ""Whole town went silent for 10 seconds?"" I click it.

The poster describes something eerily similar: one morning, for about ten seconds, **every person** in their town just froze. Birds, dogs, everything alive stopped. Then resumed. Everyone the poster asked had no memory of it; they thought the poster was pranking or delusional. The user was asking if anyone had experienced something similar. My heart is in my throat as I scroll down. There are a few replies making jokes or suggesting the user lay off the drugs. No one took it seriously. The user never posted again on the forum after that day.

I sit back, rubbing my eyes. Six years ago. I wonder what happened to them. Did it stop? Did it get worse... like it is for me? Are they *still around* to tell the tale?

A hollow feeling fills my chest. I have a terrible suspicion that I know why they never posted again.

I'm so lost in thought I nearly jump out of my chair when my phone rings. It's my bank. Probably about the weird login issues last night. With trembling fingers, I answer.

A stern voice asks for my name and security info. They say there's been unusual activity on my accounts. I blurt out that **I**experienced unusual activity too—like my entire account disappearing. The rep doesn’t chuckle. She puts me on hold for a long time, then comes back and says, ""Sir, we have no record of an account under that name. Are you sure you have the right bank?""

I stammer that I've been banking there for years, I have a debit card, checks, everything. She asks me for my social security number. I give it to her, heart pounding. After another long pause, she comes back: ""I'm sorry, there's no record of that social security number in our system.""

I hang up on her mid-sentence, hands slick with sweat. Not good. This is **really not good**.

In a panic, I try logging into every account I have—email, social media, utilities. Most of them I get into (for now), but I notice something chilling: my Facebook account shows **zero friends** and an empty timeline, like a freshly made account. The profile picture is just the default silhouette. I **had** a profile picture—a photo of me and Lisa at the beach last summer. It's gone. Everything is wiped clean as if I never used it.

My hands are shaking as I open my Google Photos—where I backed up years of pictures. Thousands of images populate the screen... and in every one where I should be, I'm either missing or blurred out. Group photos of friends with an empty space where I'm pretty sure I was standing. Trips I took alone now show only landscapes, no trace of who took them. An album from my last birthday—my friends gathered around a cake that looks like it's levitating slightly, because I'm the one who was holding it up for the camera, and now I'm not there.

A hysterical bark of laughter escapes me. It's too much. It's **absurd**. I flip to my email—maybe there's something from work or family that can ground me.

At the top of my inbox is a note from HR: *""\[My Name\], your employment records require immediate verification. Please contact HR.""*

I click it and see a short message saying my info in their system is corrupted or missing. They're asking me to come by with official ID documents.

Yeah, because my **existence** is corrupted or missing.

Without thinking, I throw on clothes and rush out the door, heading uptown toward my office. It's not quite noon on a weekday, streets bustling. People jostle past me, each absorbed in their own life. I'm weaving through the crowd like a madman.

Halfway there, I slow down. What am I doing? What am I going to tell HR—that reality forgot who I am? That I'm being erased by... *something*? They’ll send me to a psych evaluator, or the cops. And maybe they'd be right to. I don't know. But I **do** have my driver's license and passport locked in my desk at home. Documents can't just vanish, right? Right?

I pivot on my heel and head back to my apartment at a run. I need those documents. I need **proof** of identity to shove in HR's face, to shove in the face of whatever cosmic eraser is coming for me. My birth certificate, my passport, something tangible with my name.

I almost break my apartment door in my rush. I tear into my file cabinet and yank out the folder labeled ""Vital Documents"". My hands claw through it. Social security card: it's there. Passport: I flip it open to the photo page and nearly collapse in relief. My picture, my name, still there. It's like touching solid ground after being lost at sea.

I leaf through more papers: college diploma with my name, tax returns with my name. A stack of old greeting cards—birthday wishes addressed to me. **I exist. I existed.**

Clutching my passport, I sink to the floor amid the mess of papers and start to sob, huge heaving sobs that echo in my empty apartment. It's all crashing down on me now— the fear, the loneliness, the sheer mind-bending horror of watching your life unravel like a poorly written story.

After a few minutes, the wave passes. Wiping my face, I carefully pack every document with my name on it into my backpack. I don't know exactly what I'll do with them, but I feel better having proof on me. Maybe I'll frame them around myself like a protective shield if reality tries to delete me again. *See? I'm real. I have a paper trail, damn you!*

Just as I'm zipping up the backpack, there's a loud **knock** at my door. I freeze. Another knock, more insistent. Shit—did I disturb my neighbors with my meltdown? It's midday, most people are out...

I tiptoe to the door and look through the peephole. My landlord is standing there, hands on hips, looking annoyed. And behind him is a woman I don't recognize, holding a clipboard.

For a second I consider not opening, but he just bangs again. With everything going on, the last thing I need is an eviction notice for causing a ruckus or something. I open the door a crack. ""Oh, hi Mr. Lee,"" I say, voice still hoarse.

His eyes widen slightly when he sees me. ""What are you doing here?"" he asks, baffled.

""I... live here?"" I respond, equally confused by the question.

He blinks, then scowls. ""The hell you do. This apartment is supposed to be empty.""

My stomach does a slow roll. ""Empty? No, I renewed my lease last month. I **have** a lease."" I can hear the thready panic in my voice.

The woman with the clipboard steps forward, looking at me like I'm some kind of odd bug. ""Sir, apartment 8B is listed as vacant as of two months ago. Are you saying you've been... living here?""

Her tone suggests I'm some squatter. ""Yes! I'm on the lease. Mr. Lee, you **know** me, I've been your tenant for three years."" I laugh nervously, trying to meet his eyes. He just shakes his head slowly.

""I've been doing maintenance in 8C across the hall,"" he says, ""and I noticed sounds in here. Figured maybe an animal got in. We... we haven't rented this unit since the last tenant left.""

""I'm the last tenant!"" I shout, louder than I intend. My voice echoes down the hallway. ""You know me. We spoke just last week when I paid the rent.""

Mr. Lee glances at the woman helplessly. ""I **never** saw you before in my life, son.""

That's when I lose it. I yank my door fully open and march to the small desk by the kitchen nook. Rifling through the junk drawer, I grab a checkbook and shove it at him. ""Look! Here's the carbon copy of the rent check I wrote you! See the name? That's me! And you cashed it, didn't you?""

He flinches, clearly thinking I'm unhinged. His eyes flick over the check stub, then back to me. ""This... this doesn't make sense,"" he mutters.

The woman holds up a calming hand. ""Alright, let's all take a breath,"" she says in a practiced, placating voice. ""Sir, what's your name?""

I tell her. She checks her clipboard, flipping through pages. ""There's no one by that name in this building's records. Past or present."" She looks genuinely sorry for me. ""Do you have any ID?""

Yes, ID, thank god. I dig out my wallet and hand her my driver's license. She examines it, then shows it to Mr. Lee. His face scrunches up in bewilderment. ""I swear I recognize this photo from somewhere..."" he mumbles. ""Maybe the file of the guy who used to live here? But that guy moved out... or..."" He rubs his temples.

The woman clears her throat, giving him a sharp look. She probably thinks he's just confused the units or paperwork. But I can tell by his face that something is tickling at his memory. Maybe some small piece of me hasn't been fully erased from his mind.

""Look,"" I say, trying to sound rational, ""I **do** live here. Or I did until apparently I got magically evicted from reality. I know how that sounds. But please, I'm asking for just a little patience while I figure this out.""

The woman frowns. ""Magically evicted from reality?"" Yeah, I know. I sound nuts.

Mr. Lee shakes his head firmly now, as if resetting himself. ""Regardless, you can't stay here. There's no record of you or your lease. As far as the building is concerned, this unit is empty. I'm going to have to ask you to leave while we sort this out.""

He steps aside and I see two security guards from the lobby loitering by the hall elevator. He must've brought backup. My heart sinks. There's nothing I can do. I could fight, call the cops—who would no doubt cart me off for trespassing after they find no record of me either. Or maybe they'd take me to a hospital on a psych hold. Either outcome might be even worse than leaving.

Defeated, I nod. ""Can I at least grab my stuff?"" I ask quietly.

They let me back inside under supervision. Jokes on them—most of my ""stuff"" has apparently already vanished. The furniture is still here (probably because it came with the apartment—so in this reality, they're just unused furnishings), but anything personal is gone. All my clothes in the closet: *gone*. The hangers dangle empty. My toiletries, missing from the bathroom. It's like I was never here. I manage to salvage only what I had on me: the backpack of documents, my wallet, my keys, my laptop and phone. Mercifully, those last items were all in the living room. I don't even bother trying to find sentimental items—my photo albums and keepsakes are likely erased. The yearbooks, the knick-knacks from trips, everything. If I look too hard, I might break down again, and I can't afford that now.

Five minutes later I'm on the sidewalk, watching Mr. Lee lock ""my"" apartment with a new key. He and the woman hurry off, talking in low, confused tones. One of the security guys lingers, eyeing me until I slink away down the block, a disheveled nobody with a backpack, just another part of the city’s flotsam.

I walk and walk. The late afternoon sun is bright and warm, and people are out enjoying their day. A group of kids zoom past on scooters, laughing. A street vendor shouts about hot dogs and pretzels. I feel unreal, like I'm fading into the background noise.

No home. No identity. If this keeps going... soon I'll have **nothing**. *No, I'll be nothing.*

A wave of nauseating fear twists my stomach. I duck into a quiet side street and lean against a wall, trying to breathe. I can't go to the authorities. I can't go to friends or family—I'm a stranger to them now. I have nowhere to go.

Except... maybe I can **outrun** this. The thought sparks desperate hope. If whatever is happening is centered on my life here, maybe I can get outside of its reach? Like stepping out of a spotlight.

It's flimsy logic, but it's all I have. I hurry toward the train station a few blocks away. I'll take a train or bus to literally anywhere else. If I'm lucky, maybe I'll start to feel real again somewhere far away.

The station is bustling. I pay cash for a coach bus ticket heading two states over, leaving in 40 minutes. I keep looking over my shoulder, expecting the universe to throw another wrench at me before I can escape. But aside from a brief scare when the station clock flickered (power surge, I hope), nothing stops me. I board the bus, find a window seat in the back, and exhale for what feels like the first time in hours.

As we pull out, I watch the city skyline recede. Was this all happening only to me there? Or is it following me? My eyes keep scanning the other passengers for any strange behavior, but everyone seems absorbed in their own phones or nodding off.

Night falls as the bus rumbles down the highway. I'm exhausted, but too anxious to sleep, so I just lean my head against the cool window glass, watching dark fields and highway lights streak by. The steady drone of tires on asphalt is almost hypnotic. For a moment, I allow myself to entertain the possibility that this might work—that I'll get to a new city and find things normal, and maybe figure out how to fix this properly from a safe distance.

That hope shatters at the next rest stop. The driver announces a ten-minute break at a gas station and pulls over. I step out to stretch my legs and use the restroom. When I come back, my bus is **gone**.

Panic flares. It was just a quick bathroom break—why would the driver leave without me? I rush into the convenience store attached to the gas station, babbling to the clerk about the bus. She looks at me like I'm crazy. ""Bus? There ain't been a bus here tonight, hun. This is a truck stop.""

I spin around, looking at the parking lot. It's nearly empty—just a few semis fueling up. No sign of the coach bus **at all**. Even the bay where it parked is occupied by a minivan now.

My ticket clutched in my hand is the only proof I had a ride. I show it to the clerk, desperate. She shrugs. ""Looks legit... I dunno, maybe you fell asleep and dreamed getting off here?"" She seems to realize how that sounds and offers a weak smile. ""There's another bus in the morning if you wanna buy a new ticket.""

I back away, heart pounding. Morning? I check the clock on the wall above the snack shelf. 4:50 AM. How? It was around 10 PM when we stopped. I lost **hours** again... and somehow left the bus or was taken off it. Did I wander off? Or did the world just *skip* me off of it like a stone on water?

I stumble outside. The sky is just barely starting to lighten with dawn. My plan failed. I couldn't run from it. It yanked me right off the bus and stranded me God-knows-where.

A few truckers eye me warily as I pace the lot, trying not to scream. I have to face it: there's nowhere I can go that this won't follow. It's not about a location—it's **me**. I'm the one being targeted, unwritten, *deleted*.

I hitch a ride back to the city with a trucker heading that way. He doesn't ask many questions, thankfully. I'm not even sure what I babbled to convince him, some story about missing my bus and needing to get home. I spend the ride in silence, staring at the road with hollow eyes. There's no use fighting something I can't even see. If it wants me gone, it'll get its wish. It seems it nearly has already.

By the time he drops me off back in familiar territory, it's morning rush hour in the city. I drift through the crowds downtown, completely unnoticed. I'm like a ghost, slipping between people who don't see or don't care. The morning sun is too cheerful. I feel like I'm in a nightmare version of my life, everything looks the same but **nothing is right**.

I'm so tired. So **tired**. I find myself drawn to the one place that still feels a little bit safe: an all-night internet cafe tucked in a side street, one I used to come to in college. Miraculously, it's still there. The neon sign in the window says OPEN.

Inside, the fluorescent lights are a sickly greenish hue and the place smells like stale coffee and dust, but I don't care. It's almost empty, just a bored cashier playing on her phone and row upon row of aging computers. They charge by the hour. I slap a ten-dollar bill on the counter and mutter ""Keep the change."" The cashier just nods, eyes never leaving her screen, and gestures for me to take whatever station I want.

I choose a PC in the back corner. Privacy. Not that it matters—if the universe itself is watching me, there's no hiding. But some primitive part of me still wants a wall at my back.

I log in and open a blank document. My fingers rest on the keyboard. My hands are trembling again, I notice. When did that start? They feel less and less solid every time I look at them. I flex my fingers, take a deep breath, and start typing this... my story, I guess. Everything that's happened, everything I've seen.

Which brings us to now. **Now**, as I type these words, pouring my terror and confusion out onto a page in some dusty internet cafe at the edge of nowhere. I don't know if anyone will ever read it. I don't even know if it will still exist after I'm gone, or if *I'm* the only thing being erased. But I have to try. I have to leave some kind of record that I was here. That **I existed**.

Because the truth is, I'm **terrified**. Not of dying, exactly—I'm way past fear of something as normal as death. I'm scared of **being forgotten**, completely and utterly. I'm scared that when whatever-this-is finishes its work, there will be no trace of me at all. No one will even know I was ever here, living this life, *wanting to live*.

Maybe whoever (or whatever) is doing this thinks they're being merciful, deleting me quietly rather than killing me violently. A clean erasure, no mess. But there's something so profoundly horrifying about it. To be **unedited** from reality... it's worse than murder. It's like the universe is saying *You don't matter. You were a mistake, and now you're gone.*",1,1739768086.0,ArtificialNightmares,0,1.0,False

“I thought we agreed not to provide the rabbit man any unapproved reading material,” stated Security Officer Wayne Garcia as he scrutinized the security feed.

The comment briefly drew my attention away from the splitting headache that had started ever since we woke up that entitled brat. The sort of headache I planned on soothing over some rabbit stew.
As per the plan, we placed Mr. Cothonbury on some pleasant, Victorian-era themed artificial wood furnishings and had him interact with the diplomacy team vai drones as we started preparations. Unfortunately, rather than being a useful source of intel, he proved to be a whining prick who complained over every little thing and ranting over how supposedly unfair our treatment of him was and that he was *entitled* to always carry his weapon on him despite our assurances that he would receive it upon departure. I had half a mind to just knock him out again and ship him to some black site had I not already sent the message out to the portal people of our intent. We had already cycled through five members of the diplomacy team, masked by a modulated voice of course, and it didn’t help that throughout the endeavor there had been random bursts of radiation coming from his vicinity as well as unusual phenomenon such as the unexplained muting or spiking of audio from the room’s microphone array and the apparent levitation of objects.

Naturally, this had driven my security officer to paranoia.

“He is a *Coneysian*, not a ‘rabbit man’. I thought I made it clear we should be using the name they *gave themselves*. I’m sure you wouldn’t appreciate being called a *monkey*. Besides, I inspected the cultural introduction package myself. He shouldn’t have any other books on him that risk revealing anything that could be used against us,” I replied, “why are you asking me this?”

“Because,” Wayne said, as he zoomed in on the book to reveal a pristine leather-bound behemoth of a book which words that EVI identified as Nexian, “because I’ve *seen* the cultural introduction package, and I know for a *fact* that this book wasn’t part of that. Either someone smuggled him a book, or he smuggled it himself!”

I heaved a heavy sigh.

“EVI, please display the first recorded instance of the unidentified book,” I said wearily, hoping to resolve *this* crisis in short order.

**”Acknowledged, displaying instance 1 of object class ‘book’,”** replied EVI.

A scene came up on the screen from several angles whereas Mr. Cothonbury took off his hat, reached inside farther than it appeared possible, and pulled out the book from within his hat. One of the cameras happened to be directly over the hole, yet all it saw was some shadow that blocked visibility beyond an inch.

“Huh. I wonder how he got the book past the scanners,” I mused.

Wayne turned his head towards me with a crazed look in his eyes and I knew I was in for it. Again.

“The book? The man smuggled in a *personal pocket dimension* in his hat, and you are still worried about a book!?” Exclaimed Wayne, “do you understand how much of a security threat that is?”

“Come on Wayne, haven’t you been to a magic show? The ones where they pull a rabbit from a hat? There was probably just some secret compartment,” I said.

“Secret compartment? Were we watching the same thing? He stuck his whole *arm* in there. His hat is what? Ten, maybe fifteen centimeters tall? It wouldn’t fit no matter how you slice it. Face it, he’s a wizard, and has a bigger-on-the-inside hat that we can’t see into. Who knows what could be hiding there? An antimateriel rifle? An assortment of knights waiting for us to sleep so they can jump out? It could be anything! We certainly can’t allow him into a space elevator or a datacenter!” Ranted Wayne.

“Wayne, do you know what would happen if you stuck your hand into a tiny warp bubble strong enough to multiply space tenfold?” I asked rhetorically, “because I do. You aren’t getting your hand back.”

“Director, I’m telling you, this rab- Coneysian isn’t normal. Did you see what he did in the tank!? He shaped the metal grating into a blade *with his mind*! If that’s not magic, I don’t know what is,” raved Wayne. Another headache.

“Wayne, thousands of years ago we used to believe that lightning was caused by Perun casting stones from the heavens. Just because we don’t immediately see the root cause of something doesn’t mean its magic. You are being paranoid,” I said with a frown.

“Being paranoid is my *job*, Director. And whether we understand it or not doesn’t change the fact that lightning is dangerous!” Stated Wayne with his eyes flared as he pointed back at the monitor, “that right there is a living weapon! One capable of slipping contraband past our security scanners. We don’t know what it is capable of! We need updated security procedures, more guns, bigger guns, gun platforms, laser guns, customized scoped frequency-modulated gatling fusion lances…”

“I’m not having this discussion again. I gave you access to the concealed wall turret systems, and they will have to do. I am not going to go into high alert because you are having an FSI over a lost student, no matter *how* annoying he is,” I growled, then sighed, “tomorrow, when this is all over, we will have a debriefing where we will investigate the anomalous bull crap that happened over the past few hours and update our security procedures accordingly.”

“That’s not good enough,” said Wayne with his arms crossed.

“Well, it will have to do. Our mission is one of diplomacy and information gathering, not of war. I am not about to treat the portal people as wartime enemies when they have yet to demonstrate hostile intent,” I stated bluntly, “are we clear?”

“Yes Director…” muttered Wayne.

His eyes flickered with a resigned defiance, but I was content that he wasn’t about to do anything stupid. I left him to his business and made my way back to my office, grabbing some coffee on the way to nurse my migraine. Wayne was half right, the rabbit *was* causing strange phenomenon to occur around him, but there was a consistency to them. They only occurred in locations where there was ‘mana’. That implied ‘mana’ was the mechanism of action, and while it was invisible for now, the phenomenon proved there was some means of interacting with it. There was no magic at play, merely insufficiently understood physics. 

And physics had *laws*.

**”Alert: you have 1 visitor waiting in your office,”** beeped EVI from my watch.

“Who is it now?” I muttered to myself.

I opened the door to my office to find a stern, aging man with a ridged brow and a pressed blue suit. He was seated in the guest seat sipping a cup of tea and turned away from his tablet to face me as I walked into the room. I raised an eyebrow in irked surprise and extended a hand in greeting.

“Agent Baldwin,” I stated bluntly.

“Director Weir,” replied Agent Eric Baldwin of the UN-ISA as he shook my hand. Even if I hadn’t known his face from our prior meetings, his monotone voice reminiscent of the LLMs of old would have tipped off anyone in the know.

“I thought you were on Mars,” I said. 

“Officially, I still am,” replied Agent Baldwin.

“And unofficially?” I asked.

“Errands,” he replied, “and rumours. Word is you have a guest.”

“Had. We are in the middle of sending him home,” I replied. I didn’t bother asking how he knew; the UN-ISA had ears and backdoors everywhere.

“Would it be possible to delay this return?” Inquired Agent Baldwin.

“I’m afraid not. The *guest* is a member of the portal people’s nobility, and they have already been notified of his return,” I replied, thankful for my prudence, “it would cause issues if we changed course now.”

Baldwin made a clicking noise with his mouth.

“A pity. I know several parties who would be interesting in *acquiring* your *guest*. He is quite the specimen from what I’ve seen, but perhaps it is better to avoid a diplomatic incident. If you happen to come into possession of another such asset or happen to have taken… samples… from your guest, said parties would be willing to provide compensation and assistance towards your endeavor to cross the threshold in exchange,” iterated Baldwin.

“I’m sure they would, Agent Baldwin, but we already have a collaboration with the LREF and that is going fairly well,” I stated dryly.

“I was referring to your other endeavor into ‘experimental biology’,” he said as he leaned in, “your ‘exoradiation adaptation project’, I believe you call it?”

I raised an eyebrow at that, unsure exactly what Baldwin was getting at. I knew he was responsible for the Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Team, or MIST as they referred to it, that was supposed to be cleaning up the mess from the Manhattan Incident as well as the outbreak on Mars resulting from a breeding pair of stowaways that somehow made it to the red planet, but that didn’t seem directly applicable to my project.

“I hope you aren’t implying I need clean-up services,” I said dryly, “I’ve spared no effort in our protocols in the unlikely event something unexpected happens.”

“Not at all, director. ICARU Safeguards should prove adequate to contain any possible outbreak. No, I was referring to aiding in the success of the project itself,” clarified Agent Baldwin.

“I see, it’s like that then. While I appreciate the offer for help, I hope you understand I am not exactly chomping at the bit for aid from an operation that doesn’t officially exist and of which I know nothing about,” I replied neutrally.

While the Coneysian was off the table, we did take blood samples, and I had enough extra to potentially wield as a bargaining chip to leverage information out of Baldwin. However, introducing a new stakeholder with their own unknown agenda into my project came with risks.
Risks I didn’t need to take.

We were already two months into the canary test, and while there were some minor complications the results were promising. We found that the samples fell into three general categories. The first consisted of samples which had demonstrated no reactions, which unfortunately included the less adaptive candidate samples. The second category, which unfortunately included *most* of the more promising strains, was less ideal. Those strains proved to be malignant and had severe effects on the test subjects including extreme body-wide heat flashes, dramatic shifts in personality, and rapid genetic mutations. There were even a few instances where the effects proved capable of *spreading* to other subjects in the vicinity resulting in mass combustion or mutation events and even a few attempted break-outs, forcing us to take measures to incinerate the contents of the testing chambers and flush out the remains with fluorine. Naturally, Owen made a big deal of how he had predicted this outcome, and we were currently trouble-shooting the situation to determine if these samples can be safely and controllably handled.

It was the final group, the one which included Emma Booker’s samples, which proved to have the most promise. The subjects initially developed symptoms akin to the second group, but after some time those side effects either stabilized or subsided, leaving the host largely intact. That these were also the most adaptive sampled was a bonus, and despite a few voiced concerns from the usual naysayers who somehow saw this golden opportunity as ‘suspicious’ and ‘unusual outlier behaviour’ that could potentially warrant implementation of the extreme end of the safeguards, I was eager to move ahead of the agreed upon 6-month waiting period and get back to testing.

“A reasonable decision, director. Perhaps I could arrange for an introduction? My associates are very patient and would be more than happy to address your concerns. That, and I am sure that even someone as busy as you could use a short vacation, and the park domes in the UMDS are well worth the trip. I am fond of the Martian Redwoods myself. They tend to grow rather tall in the reduced gravity,” offered Agent Baldwin, his hand extended.

I hesitated for a moment to think it over before ultimately taking his hand. An introduction was harmless enough, and it was useful to learn who I was dealing with and keep the door open in case it turned out I *did* need something from them.

With that out of the way, and promises to make arrangements, Agent Baldwin left in a brisk hurry. Presumably he had to be elsewhere. In fact, so did I, if the notification on my tablet was any indication. The portal room was ready, and it was time to send our guest home.

**Professor Faeldar, Red Robe, Planar Mage**

-

The message from Earthrealm arrived without much fanfare, and as such had not been considered important enough by the Dean to be read upon its arrival an hour before dinner. Indeed, its presence had been forgotten about completely amid the surprise absence of Lord Cothonbury at the post-lecture mixer and the grand feast that followed. Not even the soul path map would reveal his location. It was only later that evening, as the Dean sat down to relax over his tea, that he received the message left from their shard of impart and uncovered Newrealmer’s intent.

The Coneysian’s fate, as the newrealmer’s claimed in their usual absent decorum, was that he had somehow stumbled into their realm, and they had found him asleep, and he was in their custody. That in of itself was not unprecedented, as students did occasionally slip from one realm to another as they learned to harness the transportium. Decorum then dictated that the stray noble would be hosted by the realm until such a time at which the Nexus would send a delegate to negotiate – and enforce – the terms of their release, at which point they would return with the delegate.

The Earthrealmers, in a pitiable display of arrogance, forewent decorum and declared *they* were opening a portal to send the young mage back, and they were doing so *almost immediately*. The Dean quickly send for myself, along with two other professors to receive the young lord, disrupting our own evening duties to handle this sudden crisis.

“Who do these Newrealmers think they are, dictating to *us* when they will open a portal? If it were *my* decision, we should be punishing their arrogance by negating their portal entirely. They should be pleading for our graces, not imposing themselves upon us!” I exclaimed with a scowl. I was in a sour mood, having been thrust away from my preparations for tomorrow’s lecture on Transportium Theory and Portal Interfacing Practices.

“Would this not be more likely to be Lord Cothonbury’s doing? He undoubtably proclaimed his matter was urgent and swayed the Earthrealmers on the importance of the Sitter,” Professor Vanavan offered. The young newly appointed professor had a soft-spoken affinity for the manaless newrealmers, one which I could only imagine stemmed from pity owing to his unfortunate witnessing of their previous candidate’s untimely demise. 

“All the more reason to leave him there!” I declared as I called forth a barrier to restrict the flow of mana, “a week spent amongst the savages in a low mana realm should serve more than sufficient to put him in his place.”

“A gifted mage amongst unenlightened weak fielders? Knowing the young lord, he might enjoy this so-called punishment. Though as amusing as starting an idol-worshiping cult amongst the newrealmers may be, I would rather not strand one of our students in a low magic realm this late into the semester. It would be best to ensure he is in good health now and punish him in some other manner,” pressed professor Belnor as she readied numerous spells to stabilize the student’s manafield for the unlikely event that the newrealmer’s portal was the cause of destabilization.

We finished our preparations and with not a moment of rest, as a current of mana spiraled towards a point where, in a display of brute force, a crude gap in space tore open to the screech of electrical discharge. Across the tear in a strange realm of metal stood Lord Cothonbury, well kempt and with no visible harm, who with an indignant huff snatched his blade from a hovering golem and crossed the threshold back to the Nexus before the tear collapsed as violently as it had formed.

“At long last! I was beginning to tire of those *dreadful* accommodations. Those *barbarians* looted my heirloom and locked it away like I was some *common* brigand! And their pathetic pantomime of civilized tea party faire was dreadful! There was not an iota of life or flavour to be found in even their tea or cheeses! Pah! I can’t imagine what sort of ransom you must have paid for me to be released in such a timely manner. Majesty blessings be upon you, dear professors, for appreciating the importance of my expedition,” proclaimed the self aggrandizing Coneysian with a deep bow.

“As it happens, the newrealmers made no demands for a ransom. In fact, they seemed quite insistent that we take you back. I must wonder what you did to offend them so,” I sneered. The details were embellished, but I wasn’t about to let the exact truth get in the way of putting the young noble in his place.

“They *what*?” Fumed Lord Cothonbury, momentarily taken aback before shifting to a haughty laugh, “surely you jest. The newrealmers must have asked for *something* in exchange for my return. They *must* have understood my value.”

“It was no jest, Lord Cothonbury,” I sneered, “perhaps the newrealmers wished to leverage a *favour* from you in the future. Or perhaps they were inferring you were of no value to them.”

“They *dare*!?” Snapped Lord Cothonbury, “I will not stand for this impudence! Return me at once, and I will-!”

“You will do no such thing,” interrupted professor Belnor sternly, “we are taking you to the medical wing, and when we are *finished* with you, you will return to your studies.”

“But professor-“ started Lord Cothonbury.

“Are you questioning professor Belnor?” I stated more than asked.

Lord Cothonbury froze, a behavioural remanent of his animal heritage, before bowing his head in acquiescence. 

“As you wish, professor,” he said with resigned dignity.

We took the short route, meandering past a set of fountains from which the imbued and gilded waters drizzled upwards and several animated portraits of the honourable elven mages who had served dutifully as the masters of the healing wing, as well as a few other mages of the adjacent realm sort. Eventually we strolled through the entrance to the tower and into one of the more secluded rooms. A fact that did not slip past the Coneysian, though a discerning gaze from myself was enough to pre-emptively silence any objections or concerns.

“Again, honourable professors, I must insist that I feel fit and hearty. Is it truly paramount for me to spend time in a ward before returning to my peers?” Inquired Lord Cothonbury.

“You spent time in an unenlightened new realm, with their strange foods and unknown traditions. We need to inspect you for disease, poison, or curses,” began professor Belnor, who awaited the young lord’s acceptance before continuing with the *real* procedure, speaking as he followed her instructions, “good. Now lie down on the bed. Close your eyes. And *open your mind*.”

That last phrase was said with a hypnotic whisper, and the Coneysian fell into a trance, ready to be examined in mind, body, and soul. Professor Vanavan and I observed from the sidelines as Belnor went to work, casting an array of medical inspection spells.

“He’s completely healthy. I’ve detected no foreign manafields within his body or ure, so unless Earthrealm has some hither-to-unknown phages or some impossible vector of infection I see no reason to quarantine him. His manafield has likewise been untampered with. No curses, no signs of foreign spellwork, not even a lingering potion effect,” stated Belnor.

“And his memories?” I inquired.

“Is it necessary to violate Lord Cothonbury’s point of privacy? He has broken no rules and as professor Belnor herself stated is completely unharmed,” piped in the naïve Vanavan.

“Oh, but it is *quite* necessary, young Vanavan. Did the young lord not, as you so eloquently stated, *provoke* the newrealmers towards their imposition? I would think such an act would require *disciplinary action*, wouldn’t you agree? I believe it prudent of us to assess his *memories* of the event,” I began, and before Vanavan could retort I raised a finger, “and I’m certain the honourable Dean would wish to know how these *newrealmers* treat their betters. They are potential *candidates*, after all.”

“That won’t be necessary,” stated Belnor, “the young lord has linked his perceptions to a memory shard.”

She followed a thin line of spellwork to the dimensional storage inside Lord Cothonbury’s cap and withdrew a memory shard which had been diligently recording the events of the day. I couldn’t help but sneer. Students were not strictly forbidden from using shards to record lectures, provided of course said shards were used exclusively for personal studying *within* the academy and had their contents *purged* of their secrets prior to returning to their realms. I, however, thought quite ill of their use, as it was my observation that students tended to use them as an excuse not to pay attention in class. That the Coneysian used one was shameful for him, though perhaps a boon for us, as professor Belnor pulled out a sight-seer from her own dimensional storage and paired it with the shard, allowing us to witness the young lord’s fate as it unfolded.

The memory began simply enough, with the young lord racing off towards the mixer to dethrone his rival with some secret shortcut in mind. Yet his shortcut was not one of the known ones, instead using the dead region of the gardens as the location of his portal. A portal which *should not* have been capable of crossing *out* of the Nexus. And yet leave the Nexus he did, as in a twist of fate the young lord found himself not on the storyteller’s chair, but in a strange cell, one which he could not perceive beyond its walls before he passed out after cussing out his nemesis.

“Belnor, are you *certain* there was no spellwork on the young lord?” I inquired.

“Aye. He must have passed out from the shock,” replied Belnor.

“I did notice Lord Cothonbury sleeping during my lecture,” added Vanavan, “perhaps he has been staying up late?”

“Indeed. Perhaps he is imitating his nocturnal *lesser harengon* brethren,” I surmised. Or were they crepuscular? I halted myself from pondering this pointless stream of thought as it made little difference. “Let us proceed then.”

Belnor held a sideways glance in my direction before continuing with the memory. Limited to the Coneysian’s subconscious magical perceptions of the world around him, things took a turn for the *strange*. A door in the *ceiling* opened up, and several golems floated down without so much as a *ripple* in the still mana. From within themselves came forth a pure white bag which *rejected* the mana around it, soon the young lord was disarmed and enveloped by the uncanny material, his perceptions snuffed out. 

He was carried for several long minutes until he was released into a room flooded with an unnaturally white light onto an equally unnatural white bed. The colour palette of the room was *sterile*, the only colour to be found was the uniform light greys from several metal furnishings. Tray tables surrounded the bed, containing a variety of metal tools ranging from black blades and scalpels not unlike that which a commoner might use to waxy curved totems which I could not discern their function. Above the table was a large, rounded slab that slowly lowered itself to the lord’s height, and to his sides moved a dozen reflective-black lifeless limbs that moved and bent like an undead spider. With crab-like claws at their ends. The abominations stuck a pair of tubes into the upper arms of the lord, with a clear fluid entering from one end, and blood exiting the other.

“This can’t be true retelling of events,” I scoffed, “the young lord must have conflated his perceptions with his dreams.”

“Perhaps they are conducting a medical examination of him? They *did* find him asleep” Offered Vanavan.

“I can’t perceive any medical spellforms, or any spellform at all for that matter,” noted professor Belnor.

“Perhaps the Earthrealmers are manipulating the arms remotely, perhaps with pulleys and strings, so they would not risk harmonization themselves?” Offered professor Vanavan.

“If you are going to insist on pursuing this folly of a narrative, I would think damage to the memory shard would be a more probable cause than imperceptible strings,” I noted.

“In any case, the withdrawal of blood concerns me,” began professor Belnor, “not so much from the absence of an entry wound as it is to the purpose of it. There are far simpler means of assessing one’s health. Unless they intend to use it as a reagent or… the less enlightened parts of many adjacent realms still use blood magic.”

A contemplative silence followed  those words. *Blood Magic*. It was a crude, barbaric means of crafting spellforms that used one’s own mana enriched blood in place of woven threads of magic. So-called ‘practitioners’ would let their own blood, or the blood of others, often in ritual sacrifices to offer blood for their blood gods. It made sense now, how these weak-fielders had finally breached the veil. I wondered how many virgins they sacrificed to make that first portal, only for their candidate to *harmonize* on arrival. How many corpses did they cast into bottomless fiery pits? Thousands, perhaps? Tens of thousands? Truly, newrealmer savagery knew no bounds.

“Perhaps they required Lord Cothonbury’s blood for the creation of their portal?” Offered Vanavan, ever the optimist.

“I suppose so, if they lacked the means to preserve his blood that could suffice for an explanation. My concerns lie for some of the other more problematic aspects of blood magic. Namely, the partition of his soul,” mused Belnor.

“Professor Belnor, are you implying that these manaless newrealmers have a means of conducting the *ritual of duplicity*? They can barely hold open a portal, and you believe they can cast a high tier ritual spellform?” I asked incredulously.

“It would lack the finesse, control, and predictability of a proper spellform, but it *is* possible. I believe it wise to keep Lord Cothonbury under close observation in case of any unusual behaviours or dopplegangers arise,” said Belnor.

“Very well, let us proceed,” I concluded.

**Professor Vanavan, Blue Robe, Planar Mage**

-

The spindly contraptions moved their  hard-wax totem-like artifices over the poor young lord to complete their hidden tasks before setting them aside and wrapping him up again in their mana-sight obscuring material like a spider wrapping a morsel, before he once again found himself carried. When he was released, it was in a room I vaguely recognized as the one across the Earthrealmer’s portal, though one could easily conflate it with a crypt or vault.

The room was sterile and plain, completely utilitarian in structure, and was lined by formament and metal pillars and plating, with that same, uncanny absence of mana just beneath their surfaces. The sole entrance to the room was a pair of blue steel insets, a central larger one and a small door-shaped one, both lacking any sort of handle or purchase. Above them was a shuttered bunker-like over-structure, looming over the room like the panopticon of a prison. The surfaces were only broken up by the unnaturally bright panels of light, an array of abyssal irises, parallel piping that connected several metal boxes, and several unusual grotesques with long tubes at their ends that resembled something… familiar… that I couldn’t yet place. They followed the movement of the Coneysian, who was beginning to stir on a common seat of some waxy woodlike material at a tea party setup that looked more akin to a menagerie display rather than an enlightened practice.

n the center of the room, demarked with strange painted striping patterns of yellow and black and led up to by a grated, railed metal ramp, was a monolithic artifice which I presumed to be the source of the portal. It was a large, dark-blue ring structure flanked and supported on either side by two pillars decorated in a mosaic of lights, tubes, wires, and gold foil. Glyphs were engraved into outcroppings spaced regularly along the ring and pillars, though they were devoid of magical essence and only a partial and malformed rendition of the ritual. 

“It would appear that the newrealmers constructed a portal artifice, in a cave, with a box of scraps” scoffed professor Faeldar, “I would *never* accept this level of craftsmanship from one of *my* students. The navigation and coordinate glyphs have been merged into a single malformed glyph, I have yet to see *any* conduit paths, and unless the cores are buried in those… tasteless pillars, then I fail to see how it could even *function*.”

“Whilst the newrealmers are upon our lips, it is strange that we have yet to bear witness to one. All we have seen so far are their… hovering golems,” I noted, gesturing at the swarm of insect-like constructs which scurried though-out the room, as well as the elvenform golem which was attempting to interact with the newly stirred Coneysian.

“Their first candidate proved incapable of surviving in the Nexus. Perhaps they cannot survive even here,” mused professor Belnor as the mana levels began to rise slowly, yet perceptively.

“If they can’t even manage *this*, then I have little hope for their *second* candidate,” said professor Faeldar with one of their lighter sneering grins.

We watched as the elvenform golem spoke with the Coneysian, giving him some familiar reading materials that we would have to censure later before it made its way to the black robes, and yet in conversation they revealed very little of themselves, preferring to puff up his grandiose self importance under the guise of friendliness as they asked questions one might expect more from an inquisitor. Indeed, the movement of the grotesques had a similar element to that of a primitive tribe, hiding in the brush and tracking an interloper with bows or blow darts as if Lord Cothonbury was an oblivious adventurer that had stumbled into a sacred grove or holy temple. This militaristic behaviour clicked in my mind, as I recalled what these weapons truly were. Guns. Manaless precision tools of death and violence. And yet, no overt threat of violence had been made. Only a token offering of food and an attempt at conversation before sending him home. I doubted the young lord truly understood how much danger he was in.

As the mana level off, it finally came time for the portal to reveal its secrets, yet even as the Coneysian approached the artifice I suspected it would only garner more questions than it answered.  The lights on the portal turned on as it sprung to life with a high-pitched whine, a whine which only increased in volume and quantity as the glyphs *flickered* weakly into activity with no apparent cause, yet there was no glyphs triggered for the creation of the portal itself, merely stabilization and navigation, as a maelstrom of lightning tore into the distorted hollow center of the artifice and *ripped* open a hole in space of its own accord.

“Impossible,” muttered professor Faeldar, “this shard *has* to be defective. There is no other explanation.”

“Perhaps the spellforms were concealed within the portal framework?” I offered halfheartedly.

“If you would you put aside your newrealmer apologetics for a moment, professor Vanavan, you would see plainly that it is not a matter of *hiding* the spellforms, it is that the magic required in the space designated for the portal itself it *completely absent*. I am sure a mage of your mettle must understand why this cannot be,” interjected professor Faeldar.

“I am inclined to agree with professor Faeldar in this regard. Lord Cothonbury was evidently tampering with his memory shard to get out of trouble and damaged it in the process. Possibly to hide his true offense,” stated professor Belnor, “I must wonder if he went so far as to tamper with his *own* memories to hide his offense.”

“But I… yes, I suppose as much,” I conceded, not willing to push against established narrative, “I’m sure the Dean would be far more interested as to how Lord Cothonbury arrived in Earthrealm.”

“Isn’t it obvious?” Said Faeldar with a sneer, “the newrealmers failed to close their portals properly. And of course, rather than ask for our *enlightened* aid, they decided to entomb their grievous errors and hoped we would not notice as the tears only progressively got worse. If anything, they should be *thankful* that we noticed when we did, else their *failure* would have resulted in catastrophe.”

“Then we should send someone over to fix it for them,” I offered.

“Yes… and to discern the fate of the young lord’s blood as well. Perhaps Lord Cothonbury should be put to service here then, if he desires to travel so much,” suggested Faeldar.

“I would think it unwise to send the young lord back,” I cautioned, thinking back to the weapons, “perhaps we should leave this matter to the Dean?”

“And sit on this problem as it worsens by the day? I think not. Action must be taken else we may lose another of our students,” replied Faeldar.

“In any case, we should *not* be entrusting our students in the hands of newrealmers,” snapped Belnor, “I doubt those chambers are indicative of Earthrealms true ambient mana, and such low levels would undoubtably be harmful to Lord Cothonbury even given adequate protection.”

“We will call for adventurers then,” declared Faeldar as the memory faded back to the ward, “specializing in mana deficient realms. And subterfuge, of course. The newrealmers may become… aggressive… should they learn of our intent. And, naturally, it would be best not to inform them regardless. They may insist on dictating terms. Best we handle this ourselves… discreetly.”

“And what if the Earthrealmers catch on?” I interjected in one last gambit to halt this madness.

“Oh, Vanavan. You worry far too much,” chided Faeldar, “there is nothing these manaless newrealmers could possibly do to hurt us.”",3,1739767968.0,JCBWritingCorner,1,1.0,False

He also added me to his close friends which is only stories of him shirtless showing his gym progress (lowkey i feel delusional for thinking maybe i’m the only one in it and he wants to lowkey show off his physique) idk that was unexpected to me.

They seem to know some things about the outside world that are irrelevant to their job, but other things they don't know. 

A few random examples of what they do know that's unrelated to their job: 
- They all seem to know what a gardner is and they gardners only work during the day
- iMark knows about the concept of a brother in law
- The team seemed to know what snow and sky were in this episode
- iIrv apparently can even drive a car
- iDylan knows what a closet is and what children are when he's awoken on the outside world
- There was a water tower in the animated video meaning Lumen thought they'd understand what that was
- They even knew what a seal was which was shocking to me

A few examples of things they do not know:
- Helena (I think) says something like ""Maybe that's what things look like when they die"" when referring to the seal, indicating that they don't know about death or decomposition
- Nobody talks about how their computers are outdated so they don't know modern technology
- Their coffee is from a fake country (I think it said Swanda on the bag) which nobody questions
- Lumen is able to lie and say they had offices in 206 countries when there are only 195 countries in the world, but nobody knew that
- Milcheck is able to lie and say that this small waterfalls is the biggest and the world and they seem to believe him.

Let’s build a life together!","I’m a 38-year-old Midwesterner, 5’11”, in great shape, and—if I may say so—pretty easy on the eyes (though I’ll let you be the judge). I bring humor, adventure, and a sense of purpose to everything I do because life’s too short to settle for ordinary.

My military background instilled in me discipline, loyalty, and the ability to thrive under pressure, but I also know how to have fun and enjoy the little things. Since then, I’ve built a life I’m truly proud of—a fulfilling career, a home I renovated with my own two hands, and the freedom to pursue my passions. Now, I’m ready for my next big adventure: finding the right woman to share it all with—marriage, kids, and a lifetime of unforgettable moments.

I don’t smoke or do drugs, but I’m a fan of strong coffee, the occasional drink, and an active lifestyle. My downtime is anything but lazy—you’ll find me scuba diving, literally traveling the world (67 countries and counting), experimenting in the kitchen, riding motorcycles, boating, or tackling DIY projects (yes, I built my house solo). Family is my foundation, and I believe in living a healthy, intentional, and meaningful life.

I’m looking for a woman who’s kind, emotionally grounded, and ready for something real. If you’re in your 20s or early 30s, have a great sense of adventure, and are looking to build a future filled with love and laughter, let’s connect.

1irbu7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/bondha_diaries/comments/1irbu7r/i_am_exhausted/,I am exhausted.,"I’m not really expecting a response—just need to get this out. No TLDR. Just thoughts.  

Life feels heavy. I’m drained, not just from one thing, but from everything. At the end of the day, all I really want is to do laundry and file taxes with someone who loves me the way I love them. But, well, here we are.  

Right now, I’m unemployed, so yeah—broke, stuck, just floating. But I know I’ll figure it out. I have the brains for it. That part doesn’t scare me. What does? The loneliness.  

I’m so tired of loving myself. I’ve done it for years. I’ve bought myself little gifts, written notes, made things special for me. But it’s exhausting when there’s no one to share that love with. And it’s not like I never tried. I pursued people I liked. I gave a fair chance to those who pursued me. I was careful. I was empathetic. I was smart. None of it mattered. Every single time, I was left picking up my own pieces.  

One strung me along for 2.5 years, only to tell a mutual friend I never meant anything to him. Another gaslit me so badly I had to go to therapy. No apologies, no closures—just me, pulling myself out of the mess they left behind. And then came the shortest one, the one that somehow hurt the most. Three months. I got ghosted. And now, I’m choking on flowers.  

(If you don’t know the metaphor—choking on flowers is the idea of unrequited love taking root inside you until it suffocates you. It grows in your lungs, wraps around your ribs, until you can’t breathe.)  

I don’t understand how someone can make you feel the warmth of their presence, the safety of their embrace, just to walk away and act like none of it mattered. It’s cruel. And it’s made me question if love is even real, if people are even capable of it. Because I don’t want to love anymore. And that is the saddest part of it all. Love is something I was always good at. Not just in my own way, but in the way people said they wanted to be loved.  

Anyway.  

There are ways to measure someone’s declining mental health. For me, it’s coffee mugs. The ones I leave, untouched, on my desk after finishing my coffee—because I can’t find the energy to wash them.  

One day, I’ll get up and wash my mug as soon as I finish drinking. And when that day comes, I’ll keep doing it, every single day. And when I do, I’ll update here, however long it takes.  

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Hope you have a good day. I’ll try my best to survive mine.  

Funny how, at the end of the day, it’s love that breaks me—not my other struggles. Maybe because deep down, I know I can handle everything else. But love? That’s always been left to the mercy of someone else.",13,1739767457.0,bondha_diaries,1,1.0,False

Hope y’all are doing well. You can call me Esac or Amund. Either works. I’m 34 years old, I like anime and video games! 

Super into Pride and Prejudice and LotR, they’re both comfort medias. 

I’m a self taught artist, and I used to work in an art museum, so like art history is a thing I really like. I also like museums! And just hanging out at coffee shops and sketching, or writing if time permits. 

So what am I lookin for?

I’d love to have a friend that draws and makes their own OCs. 

I’m a big fan of monster characters too!

Other than that it would be nice to have more gaming buddies. We don’t have to play games together all the time, but it would be nice to play FFXIV together :) I still need to do dawntrail. I’ve just been leveling the crafting stuff. 

I’m alt/goth if that matters and poly (I have 2 partners). 

Big fan of cute things, rocks, stickers, jewelry and makeup, bats, werewolves and vampires. I loooove sunsets and the rain!

1irbnzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1irbnzy/what_actually_are_social_places_for_men/,"What actually are ""social"" places for men?","This was actually meant to be a comment in another thread but it got locked and honestly I'd like to ask this to the community because the following quote made me pretty sad because I do realize that it's the normal mindset now:  

> you should not try to work on your conversation skills by casually approaching people you’re not friends with in places not designed for meeting new people. Start with places and functions designed for this.

This in my opinion is EXACTLY the problem we face, which is collapsing our ability to be empathic and socialise. So called 3rd places are vanishing more and more. It used to be normal that you met people literally almost everywhere. Because there wasn't some kind of ""social level"" assigned to a place. But now we labelled and organized everything. Every place that exists has exactly one purpose and straying from that is seen as bad or rude or something else negative. And this is completely imploding our ability to actually function in a society and leads to loneliness even though we're surrounded by people.  

+ The coffee shop where you buy your coffee? Not social, it's only to get your coffee, although there might be 10-20 people there.  
+ The bar where you buy your drinks after work (if you even go there)? Not social, it's only to buy drinks and talk to your own friends, even though there might be 10-20 people there.  
+ Going to the club? Not social, it's only meant to be dancing with friends even though there might be 200 people there.  
+ Library? Not social, only meant to be reading or borrowing books and being silent, even though there might be 30 people there.  
+ Concert? You go there to have fun with your friends or family and listen to music. Not social, even though there might be thousands of people there.  
+ Going to the gym? It's for training. Not social even though there are dozens of people there.  
+ Going to the park? Either you go with your kids (men even struggle with this, die to perceived atranger danger) or family or some other very specific person or friends. People get suspicious when you approach them. So I guess it's not a social place either?   
+ Public transit? Only meant for travelling from A to B. Not social, even though there are dozens of people around you.  
+ Restaurants/Diners? Not social, you only go there with specific people (friends, family, dates) and aren't meant to interact with anyone outside of the group or the waiter.  

There are only two places/events, which come to my mind, where people ARE actually meant to interact each other. One is sports events (football/soccer/cricket) and even those tend to fall more and more into the concert category, where you're basically only acting within your friend group and aren't supposed to be talking to random people. Additionally they often are heavily leaning towards one gender/sex.  
The other is conventions or fairs. But be honest, when was the last time you were at one?  

These situations or places where bog standard opportunities to meet people a couple of decades ago. So called 3rd places where you could do something AND meet people. But now everything is assigned a single purpose and you're not supposed to stray from that. Dating apps completely cannibalized the purpose of naturally meeting people in places. And now that everyone is kinda waking up from them, that they don't work, there is nothing left to remedy the situation and nowhere to go or meet. Or that's just my impression?  

Idk maybe I'm out on a limb here but what are your solutions or thoughts on this?  ",10,1739766843.0,GuyCry,22,0.75,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\

  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I know that I can achieve this with fashion through things like brown or stable solid colors and comfortable clothes.

I often take care of my friends and cook for them, I let them stay with me for as long as they need, I often brew them coffee and make them sweets or pastries and comfort food.

I am trying to figure out how to full embody this more, as I deeply enjoy caring for others.

I have even had dreams of being a shepherd, albeit somewhat unrelated.

1irbj71,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1irbj71,Parisian Haze,"This is my entry for February’s Competition Thread.

Presenting – Parisian Haze. 

Ingredients:

•	45 ml Brandy (Used St Remy VS)

•	20 ml Amaretto

•	10 ml Hazelnut Syrup (Used Monin)

•	10 ml Cold Brew Coffee (You can use Coffee Liqueur as well)

•	1 dash Coffee Bitters ( I used non alcoholic Bab Louie Bitters which is available)

•	Ice for mixing and a large cube for drinking


Recipe:

Fill a mixing glass with ice. Pour in brandy, amaretto, hazelnut syrup, cold brew coffee, and coffee bitters. Stir for 20-30 seconds until well chilled.

Strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.

Smell: It smells of toasted nuts. I considered adding an orange peel as a garnish, but it clashed with the smell. 

Taste: Initial taste is a hazelnut and coffee. You can taste some fruitiness of brandy with some notes of rum. Through and through, the drink has a nutty taste to it. It is not overwhelming, though.

Mouthfeel: The initial sip feels heavy due to the nutty smell, but it becomes light and silky immediately. To make it more viscous, I tried Kahlua instead of cold brew, but it made the drink sweeter. I preferred it with cold brew.  ABV is around 21% with the cold brew. 

So, I love the Godfather (Scotch and Amaretto) and I considered using Amaretto with Brandy and Hazelnut. I learned Cognac and Brandy already exists. So, I am not sure whose riff this will be, but I derived the name from the latter – French Connection became Parisian Haze, a combo of Brandy and ‘Haze’lnut.

Cheers!

We see each other once or twice a week when work schedules allow, and haven't had the official exclusivity talk yet. Travelling well together is a huge dating priority of mine as I like to travel as much as I can and hoping to find someone who I can occasionally travel with. I was waiting to see if we travel well together before having the exclusivity talk.

Well, for Valentine's Day weekend, I took him to my family's cabin as a fun getaway to see if we click well as travel partners. Unfortunately, we did not click as well as I'd hoped for multiple reasons, with the main one was that he was stoned all weekend. I enjoy weed in the evenings, but from the moment I picked him up to when I dropped him off, he was stoned. He likes to wake and bake on 420-friendly vacations and is much more of a morning person, whereas I'm a night owl who prefers a slower morning to relax, enjoy my coffee, and read a book. Our energy levels are completely opposites, and he regularly needs afternoon naps to be able to stay up past 9:00 PM (he often falls asleep when we spend time together during the week) but I'm much more energetic in the afternoons. We couldn't agree on where to eat nor how to spend our time. I felt like I wasted a whole weekend.

  
My romantic emotions have disappeared, and I'm kind of bummed out because I wanted it to work. We have other issues as well, but not travelling together is the biggest one for me. I think most of the issues are caused by core incompatibilities, and I can't ask him to change who he is. I guess I'm looking for reassurance that I'm not crazy for wanting to break up over these issues. Has anyone else navigated this?",3,1739766027.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I recently posted online (first timer mistake, as I got to know later) that I had a couple of projects and would love to have some students reach out if they want some research experience.

Result: I got 12 applications in first hour and by end of first 24hrs I got 200+ applications. I took the post down and used my weekend to go through the applications. I spend around 8 hrs going through them all. And here are some things I learned which I think would help students particularly froom this community as most students mentioned they wanted to come to Australia (or go to US) for MS and could use this experience.

1. Don't apply with generic stuff. I clearly mentioned that I was looking for students with some basic training in research and/or are proficient in python. Most students just dumped GPT generated body in email. No mention of my project, the requirements, my prior research. Honestly I stopped reading full mail after the first hour and as I learned over coffee from a very senior professors, they don't read emails over 6-7 lines from random people anymore.
2. Customize your Resume : I was shock to see students in their first year MSc have still kept debating prize in 11th class. Great for you but what does it have to do with your Psychology research experience. Keep the core same, your degree, projects (some), grades, courses you too constant but 25-30% of your resume needs to be customised to the role you are applying.
3. I need it, I want it, I will try: Sorry, but even if I want to give a shot I have got 3 positions and 300 students who really want it. This is something I learned towards the last year of your Bachelors and as it seems most students do learn it too late. Don't beg, you will not get the job. Show how you are the right fit. Tell me how you can be a good addition to the team, highlight connections like I know python and have worked on text in my so and so project (as in your resume) and it is using similar skillset that you have mentioned in your requirements. At best if you don't have much of the similar experience atleast say you'll learning this from so and so course online before the start of internship. Put the efforts , that's something that missing from almost all applications.
4. Don't try be a saint, no one is: I would love to contribute to your project for the betterment of the society. BS. You are not a Greta Thunberg, be honest and say what you want at the end of the internship. You want a LOR for Masters, you need it for your college credits, you want It to get a good job. Be straight, it's good for you only. Like a student mentioned that I want a internship for college requirements, I'm not really experienced in the domain but I'm willing to learn. She was humble enough to mention she is trying she comes from a Tier 3 city and thus never knew about such stuff. She is currently in her 4th Semester. Guess what, I shared a list of courses to her (all free) and told if she could do these by summer I'll take her on for a project.

All these are points you might already know, or had a hint of but sadly most students forget about it when it comes to applying. Apply for 5 positions properly, that 50 at mass. You have a better shot through the first approach.

Feel free to ask any questions if you have, don't have a class today.\\ud83d\\ude0a",2,1739765787.0,Indians_StudyAbroad,10,0.75,False
